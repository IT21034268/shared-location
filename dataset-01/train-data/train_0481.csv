4,Please Stop Laughing At Me...,"Very interesting. Made me rethink the advise that I was giving my grandson and help me feel better about taking my son out of 4th grade to homeschool him, he is an adult and still has a huge and sweet heart that he would have lost if I left him in public school."
1,!!! Cry Me A River !!!,"I am not trying to be cruel, but this book was a load of bull. I personally would not EVER read ""Please Stop Laughing At Me"" again in my life. Sure, I guess I pity Ms. Blanco for having to go through all of that as a kid, because no one should be forced into that situation. But her claiming to be 'friends with the blind kids and the special ed. kids' was a little hard to swallow. I wouldn't know, I wasn't born yet. The whole book just seemed to me to be a rather loud whine for pity. Or maybe it was written to releave her of her 'anger'. Either way, it was poorly written: maybe Ms. Blanco WAS good at making speeches, but she obviously is not good at making books. I just can't beleive that the publishers would allow such a stupid and pointless book to go through the writing process, let alone encourage her to write another. If I saw another book by Jodee Blanco at a bookstore, I would deffinately not buy it, no matter what the topic."
1,Stay Away,"This book was awful! I had to read it for a book club and it couldn't be more exagerated. Blanco claims to be bullied and harrased yet never gives reasons as to why she is treated so poorly. This book is not at all realistic for a true story.The author herself claimed that her book was rejected 30 some times by publishers, you would think that she would realize that perhaps her book sucked, but she didn't get the message. I am writing this to give the message to all the readers considering this book, move on don't waste your time."
3,Didn't like the ending,"As a person with special needs that was bullied, I didn't like the ending. The classmates repented but you get the impression that it was only because the author was a successful writer. Chances are excellent none of those who apologized to the author, apologized to the special needs kids. This lack of repentance on the part of the parents of todays youth is the reason why the bullying continues. I know there are many who were bullied along with me who are now accepted at reunions because they are not ""losers"". She could have at least mentioned the people they DIDN'T apologize to. In the minds of my abusers ...the way they treated me is still ok. It's sickening because like I said before..these are the parents of this generation of bullies."
1,Jodee is full of S***,"I think there is only one element of truth in this whole entire story, and I'm not even sure if it's true for that matter, it's such an obscure part but it was the only part in the whole 276 page memior that actually seemed semi realistic. That part was the part where her mother brought her home from school and made her a grilled cheese sandwich. But like I said that part was probbabally twisted as well, I'll bet it was either a ham sandwich or a tuna sandwich or possibally not a sandwich at all possibally a bowl of soup or a shrimp burrito or something, or else she probabally just ended up taking her right back to school. Because whoes parents would baby them by making them a grilled cheese sandwich just because someone was being mean to them. What a spoiled rotten little turd!!!!!!!!!"
2,Makes You Want to Cringe,"The title itself is enough to make you want to cringe. But once you start reading it you realize how shallow and vacuous the book is, a glib and badly-executed presentation from a public relations expert.Educators know what an impossible problem bullying is. It's often invisible, its victims' reticence quickly morph into a depression, and often the bullies are themselves victims. Unfortunately, none of this complexity and paradox is presented in ""Please Stop Laughing at Me: One Woman's Inspirational Story."" What we do learn is that you will be hated and bullied in school if you rat your friends out to their overprotective mothers and if you are ugly. But there's hope: if you have rich parents who can pay for plastic surgery in the Mayo Clinic this bullying will come to an end."
5,This was great,"This was such a great book. I was reading it on an airplane and i was crying almost the entire time. The reality of it is herat wrenching and I admire Jodee Blanco for going into her past and writing this book. There was nothing in this book i didn't like but if you aren't looking for a tear jerker, reality check i seriously would not recomend it."
3,Engaging but not perfect,"About: True story of the author's school days, where she was tormented by bullies.Pros: Quick read, engaging, touching. Fans of David Pelzer or Torey Hayden's books would probably like this one. Good line: ""The bullies remember, but the the outcasts never forget."" Will force you to remember your school days, for better or for worse.Cons: Gets a few facts wrong (the elf in Rudolph is named Hermie not Kirby as she thinks). As with all memoirs, one can't help but wonder what experiences were embellished (and the elf error above does not instill confidence in her accuracy). Professional ""look how great I am"" biography at end is unnecessary."
1,Horrible,"I really wished I had read some of the reviews before purchasing this horrible book. It is poorly written and very unrelatable to anyone who has been bullied. I would not recommend this for anyone seeking advice on how to deal with bullies. I actually found myself ""rooting"" for the bullies by the time I had finished this book."
1,"I don't believe you, Jodee!!","Right off the bat, I'll say that bullies are bad, but for god's sake, who calls their mother during a makeout party? It seems the author tattled on people when not much was going on, and when she was being harassed, she didn't. I didn't believe most of her descriptions of the more outrageous bullying, because I went to public school too and here's the thing-- kids move on. There's always a new person to pick on. Switching schools over and over in the vain hope that someone will eventually not want to crazy glue her locker shut or flush her stuff down the toilet obviously doesn't work and if she was as brilliant as she seemed to think, she might have gotten that after the 2nd school.No one could possibly be as perfect and wonderful and smart as Jodee. Sorry, folks, this book is awful."
1,Is this fiction?,"My girlfriend and I read this book together while on a trip and it was very difficult to get through - not because of the torment that the author supposedly went through, but because of the blatant over-exaggeration of her bullying. Not having lived with the author, I can't state for sure that this book is fiction, but some of her stories seem just so completely fake that we spent most of the time laughing. We bought this book to gain some insight into bullying and maybe be emotionally moved. Sadly, neither of those goals were achieved. Additionally, this book really just made me pissed at the author for wasting 3 hours of my time. I really want my $11 back from Target. Does this review make me a bully?"
1,Bullying is wrong but hard to like this author,"I wanted to read this book because I recognize that bullying is a big problem these days. I thought getitng Jodees insight would be informative and interesting. Instead, I foun myself really hating her. She portrays herself as a perfect angel who does no wrong. Just reading her opening letter got on my nerves because she toots her own horn as an expert on bullying. Kids do terribel things to each other and do hurt each other. I still remember a particular boy who bullied me in middle school. But, I am not delusional enough to think I never hurt anyone else. Of course it was not right, but Jodee portrays herself as a saint and a complete victim. Frankly, I hated her just from reading her sanctimonius opening letter."
3,Not very insightful,"I was interested in and excited about this book when I heard Ms. Blanco interviewed on the ""Diane Rehm Show."" However, it proved to be lackluster for 2 reasons. First, it read like one of Beverly Cleary's Ramona Quimby books, which I enjoyed when I was a kid, but don't qualify as meaty adult reads. Second, I feel that the more interesting story is the fact that the author herself admits to feeling several very haughty feelings toward her tormentors, especially at her high school reunion. I would've enjoyed an exploration of how she isn't different from her tormentors at all - when she had power, success, and beauty, she let it make her feel better than those around her. All in all, the book seems like her opportunity to say get back at the bullies, which is fine. She definitely deserved to get some things off of her chest. Plus, anything that brings more attention to school bullying as more than mere child's play is a good thing indeed."
3,Difficult to Read,"This was a difficult book for me to read on a number of levels. As a parent and an educator it breaks my heart on a personal level to read of Blanco's struggles. No parent wants their child to be treated in such a way, and no educator wants any child they come in contact with to have these difficult experiences.However, the way they were relayed in the book made it difficult for me to keep reading. The book is a downer (as it should be), but lacks the needed ooomph to make you want to keep reading.Thank you to Thomas Nelson for providing this book for review. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's 16 CFR, Part 255."
1,"I wanted to slap her, myself!","What a silly disappointment of a book. The writing is akin to an overly long essay submitted for extra credit by a seventh-grade student. Almost everything I read in this book was worthy of a snort of contempt--or, at the very least, an eye roll."
5,An emotional story to share,"As a student in college and a classroom teacher, I had to read Blanco's book for adolescent psychology. I know read it to my class at the beginning of the school year. Many students experience bullying, as the bully or as the victim. Blanco's book is important to my curriculum because it gives the students an opportunity to reflect upon someone else's experience. I reccommend this book to EVERY parent, teacher, youth group leader. Read it and discuss it with your students. The more adolescents understand, the greater our chances for stopping bullying in our school and homes."
2,Stop whining already,"In August Jodee Blanco came to our school and gave a summary of basiclly the book. I decided I would read it, but as I did. I decided that I was one of those bullies, she would have had it way worse. She goes to like 4 different schools and is popular in the beggining and then manages to screw up repeatedly. Why does she hang with the mentals? Why does she call her mom at the slut's party???? [...] She goes to her reunion and everyones all nice to her. WTF??? When she came to our school. she was like ""Go up to somebody and let them sit with you"" We made fun of her for weeks."
3,An interesting story,"This book was an interesting account of a young woman surviving. I read it to get some insight how to help my daughter who is a victim of bullying. I do agree with Jodee that sometimes it is the ""normal"" kids who given labels and sent to therapy so they can fit in with the tormentors and evil-doers.I also wondered why a young woman so dedicated to helping the disabled would make a vow to help Micky Rooney? How odd! With so much trouble in the world why would she pledge that in the future she would help him do something. Wasn't he already an established movie star?What did this book teach me? If I send my teenage daughter to Greece and put her through years at NYU she will receive approval from those who taunted her in her adolescence.Apparently Jodee can offer more for victims of bullying if you pay her big bucks for her seminars. Perhaps that is worth it, but this book offers no advice."
2,Good lookin'....but horrid quality......!!!,"This mouse looks real cool, and would compliment about any pc workplace...and I was impressed at first...but that was short lived. This mouse only has the ""look"". 1.) The surface paint started rubbing off after a while, and the grey surface area beneath could be seen. 2.) The cursor is erratic. This is probably the mouse's worst defect... when gaming, the cursor goes all over the screen and is extremely annoying!!!!!3.) And yes, the mouse's clicking surface is very, very sensitive. I thought Microsoft is capable of making good mice.But what more could I have expected for 10 bucks???"
2,Neat looking but falls apart,"Got matching ones for me and my wife, we prefer corded mice, unfortunately both of these cords' connections frayed out within 2 months."
5,"The title should be: ""Stop reinventing the wheel""","When we learn and start programming we're attempted to write code to solve any problem without find to know if that is the best way. No matter if the code is about 3,000 or 300 lines, which matter is if you could solve the customer's problem. But a lot of problems were solved by experienced programmers and software architects and they have documented these problems for us. So, if somebody wrote tested-good-code, why we'll ""reinvent the wheel""? My opinion is: study the progrmming language, try to write and solve a lot of problemns, and than study this book. After read you'll have much more skills to solve problems in shorter time. I recommend for intermediate through advanced programmers."
5,This is the most important and comprehensive J2EE design pattern book,"Do you know GoF ? Do you know basic 14 design patterns ? Do you know Java ? Do you know J2EE ? Do you know EJB ? Are you an architect of Java based applications ? OK. But if you do not know the book Core J2EE Patterns you are not taking designing and implementation of J2EE applications seriously. The book describes all the details, consequences and other aspects of J2EE design patterns. I recommend to read book sequentially and to make a lot of bookmarks and lot of skips into related links in the book.You get clear picture of overall architecture possibilities in J2EE world. Also thanks to this book I became a certified architect."
1,It is outdated.,"This was the bible I used for a project, I loved the ideas and I named the classes after the names in this book.However, 3 years later, after reviewing this book, I would say, many ideas in the book are already outdated and over emphasized in the past. Just remember the good old days when EJB was glorious and almost every company went for it.After the EJB rush, now when we are back to basic, we realized that many Plain Old Design Patterns are real gold. I would suggest you don't rely heavily on J2EE, focus on domain design instead.Many books provide this advice on domain driven development, such as Design Patterns, Refactoring, Domain Driven Design.After you read those books, then read this book again. You will agree with this review.http://www.amazon.com/Books-for-Professional-Java-Developers/lm/R34SZ976NXXD22/ref=cm_lm_byauthor_title_full/104-7074534-4633550"
4,Solid book on Java Enterprise architecture,"It is a MUST-HAVE J2EE architect/developer book. It provides the most important and relevant patterns in J2EE design and development based on Gang of Four. The architecture guidance and best practices described are very valuable.This book needs an update for Java EE 5. Not sure, those updates are posted on their web site."
5,Highly recommend this book.,"If you're designing Enterprise J2EE applications and you want to do it right the first time, then you need to read Core J2EE Patterns. There are very few technical books that can provide so much value to an organization as this one can. Our senior architects have adopted and utilize the information in Core J2EE Patterns to such a degree that it has become the most reused artifact in our repository. I'm personally excited about the hardcover 2nd edition - besides the six new patterns, refactorings, and new micro architecture - it allows for greater emphasis when we bang our heads against it while asking, ""Why didn't we just read the book first?"" This book will have a significant impact on your organization!"""
5,Must Read Book,"The author describied useful patterns for application architecture and design strategies for the presentation tier, business tier, and integration tier. The section on refactoring is worth reading.i prefer to read this book if any wants to know more about j2ee patterns.."
3,Too much code examples,"Descriptions of patterns are good, but the book has too much code examples - in my opinion - and most of then based on EJB 2.x"
4,good book,This book only covers the J2EE desing patterns. You need to refer GO4 book to get complete knowledge of OO patterns.
3,"Nice Glasses, Long Wait!","I ordered these on Dec. 7th. Amazon said they were in stock with 'Re Stock It' and would be arriving between Dec. 13 and 18th. They arrived January 5th with no explanation even though I sent Amazon and Re Stock It an e-mail asking about the status of the order. For some reason The Free Shipping I had been getting in Dec. 2007 did not apply to this item and I paid over $10.00 to wait a month for the glasses. My experience with Amazon has been good but if the next item I want comes from Re Stock It, I won't be ordering. Glasses are pretty, not as large as the Libbey Cobalt Goblets I already have."
5,A Great Reference,"I received Lilith's Fire as a gift and I have to say that it's one of the best gifts I've gotten this year. I've been researching Lilith for a while and I've been trying to find a good reference that would really tell who Lilith was and what she was about. This book fits that. The author writes about Lilith in a positive light and talks about her true nature, not that of a demoness (which she is not). I really enjoyed this book and I recommend it to anyone who is trying to seek Lilith and find out what this Goddess represents."
3,"Works okay, but nothing extraordinary","The grip doctor is an okay product for changing your grips. It works good on groundstrokes, but not so good on serves. I bought it because I wanted to stop shifting towards an eastern FH-grip from a continental at contact, but it still shifts a little bit while wearing this."
3,Not awesome,"Good price. All in all, not a horrible shovel. Good for pushing moderate amounts of snow. Not good for shoveling packed snow, such as the berm at the end of your driveway after the plow goes by."
2,"Suncast SP1400 20-Inch Snow Shovel/Pusher, Navy","I ordered 2 shovels together they sent me an email canceling the 18"" metal one I wanted to cancel the whole order they would not do that! Which did not make sense to me because they were canceling one not me but the price I ended up paying for a $12.00 shovel was 3x the price not worth it! Suncast SP1400 20-Inch Snow Shovel/Pusher, Navy"
3,Mismatched style,"Regardless of what you think of the controversial Schlueter, his unique style is simply not suited to these classical pieces. Schlueter can certainly handle them technically, but his sound is too amorphous and fuzzy for the concertos to sound like the grandiose pieces they are. Even his piccolo playing has this quality. The ornaments also sound out of place, and the trills aren't great. I even noticed a pitch issue here and there. For the Tartini, listen to the Maurice Andre recording. For the others, try Marsalis or Hardenberger."
3,Pity.,"Charles Schlueter was a very fine player; however, in this recording he still had not got to the point where he could let go of being the trumpet player/technician and focus 100% on music-making. It's a bit sad when a such accomplished musician at this age still exhibits technical habits from high school days - unable to get over himself. Classic example: at 2 minutes and 30 seconds of first movement of the Neruda Concerto was tacky trumpet playing at its worst.At times it's obvious when the ""musician"" is suddenly trumped by the ""trumpet player"" at the expense of music which becomes downright tacky.Overall this is just another trumpet recording that does not make particular contribution to the art of trumpet playing. There are some fine moments of music, though, and this recording should serve as archive of a very accomplished trumpet player."
5,Understanding the purpose and power of Men,This is a must read for every man.Read it READ IT read itto understand who God created you to be
5,Great read,"This book is awesome for anyone who wants to discover his identity and his duties. Though the book is written specifically for men, it can be very effective for woman who want to discover about their husbands and boyfriends.Overall,5/5"
5,Great Product,Fast shipping and great description of the condition of the product. Will buy from again with no problem.
5,Very powerful insight into God's Purpose for the Man,Our small group used this book along with the study guide and worked our way through it. The group consists of couples. This is important to know because I believe the women in the group were able to get just as much out of this as the men. The Power and Purpose of Woman is next on our agenda.
4,Very nice,"Ms. Weinstein does a very good, concise job of explaining the rudiments of Dianic Wicca and its use of witchcraft. She does not pretty up her words, although she relies a bit too much on ""Words of Power"" for my tastes, though that is only my Personal preference. Also, if you are NOT Dianic, this may not be as useful a text as a more generalized book on Wicca such as those by Cunningham. Finally, when she tries to explain the metaphysics of magick and such, I tended to get lost. But that's waayyyyy in the back, and the rest of the book was an enjoyable, informative read, even if it is not of my particular tradition :) Good reference book :)"
3,An Interesting Guide,"This book, on the whole, was a very enjoyable read. However, the simplistic way the author handles ethical and philosophical problems was a little annoying. A little white-lighty, but still a good book."
4,Surprisingly good movie,"I usually don't like subtitled movies, but this was a good one. I'm sorry that more people don't know about it. It's funny, touching, and real."
3,I was expecting a little more,"I was not able to find the last ""Norteño"" track that I listened in the movie. The only one available uses vulgarity attemting to attract listeners. Not recommended."
1,DO NOT BUY,"Please do not waste your money on these, you are better off paying a little more to get better quality. These picks are verry flimsy and cheap feeling. When playing with my guitar I actually cracked one. I also got these because of the wide range of color it showed in the picture. When i recieved them i got 3 colors; yellow, black, and brown/black. The overall product is horrible. However the seller did mail them quickly. :) only positive thing about this product."
2,FALSE!!!,"I know most of you are not going to care about this, but we use guitar picks for jewelry making purposes. I saw this on amazon with the picture showing all the different colors that were supposed to be in the pack, and purchased it. It arrived today and only had the brown marble color and the drab blue color in the pack. If you're a guitarist, stick to the tortex because they don't wear out all that quickly and dont chip. If you're using them for art purposes, try fender or clayton for better, prettier, and most importantly ACTUAL colors."
1,Pics,"This is a Total RIPOFF!! Dont Buy from, doesnt send multi colored like advertized, send black and white! Will never buy from again!"
2,Mixed Color Guitar Picks,"Unfortunately they were for a teenaged boy and the only colors in the pack were pink, white and light blue. They weren't too mixed in colors."
5,great,"beautiful book , if you like good smart narrative you will enjoy this book about a high class kid with a golden heart from Peru."
2,Overrated,"This is by far the most known novel Bryce has written, and there isn't much to comment unfortunately. It's a classic in Peru as far as I read but, as Chinua Achebe's 'Things fall apart', this is one of those folklore books that won't appeal to my Fiction reading hunger. It seems shallow most of the times, the character POV of the kid Julius never works out what's going on around him; no true sequels; Julius' parents are made of one piece of cardboard; the setting is the only thing that might be of interest (very much like Achebe's novel); and Julius barely grows by the end of the novel (at page 350!). For that matter, go check Coetzee's 'Waiting for the barbarians' or Peruvian Vargas Llosa's 'The war of the end of the world', two contemporary masterpieces."
4,a national anthem,"If your a fan of y.m.o you'll love this cd, it's kind of a long the same vein as 'technodelic'. Song's like LDK would have quite easily sat in the recording. Within the first few seconds of the first track PICNIC you know what your gonna get. Beautifully odd strange electronics leading straight in to a load of robots singing their song as they go on a day out. The next song FUNICULI FUNICULA seems to be a national anthem for some kind of army stuck in a video game...honest...you'll be huming it as well! Harry Hosono manages to make the most quirkiest music beautiful he kind of catches you off guard. One minute it's all tongue in cheek the next he puts up some straight forward(ish) electro it's a mixture of both instrumental and words all be them odd; 'my loves like a tear-jerker, like mouldy junk food' but anyway a good album if you want a bit of fun and can listen to music that doesn't take itself too seriously... I wouldn't play it to anyone though!"
3,"Wrong ""Paleface""","I was looking for the classic Bob Hope movie ""The Paleface"" about an itinerant dentist ""Painless Peter Potter"" and a gunslinging gal played by Jane Russell. Turns out this set of three silent movies includes one of the same name featuring Buster Keaton. Not what I was looking for, so I gave it away. If you're really into ancient silent movies you might enjoy it. If so, more power to you. If not? Join the club."
3,Okay if the price is right,"This dvd is okay if you can get it for under $5 like I did. If I'd have paid any more for it I would have felt cheated. Turn the sound down, though- the music they stuck on these has NOTHING to do with the movies.For the most part the picture quality is quite good, although I noticed in The Blacksmith some seriously deteriorated frames."
3,Sexy forty-something women at the beach!,"The actresses in this one are gorgeous with lovely bodies, but the story was much too campy and not near enough erotic for me to give this one more than three stars. I liked the girl-girl potential, but the inclusion of the surfer-dude houseboy and the way-too-short love scenes between the women keeps this one from rating any higher. Also, nudity is basically non-existent, just a brief flash of one woman's breasts. I expected more. Campy can be fun, but this one's just campy-silly, not campy-erotic."
2,"Smells nice, boo for super thick hair","After reading the reviews and how this is great for very thick hair without weighing it down, I was excited. It smells nice but that's about it. I don't find it amazing or worth the price tag. Rather use Loreal's line for 6.99."
1,not good,This product does not seem like the real thing. My hair feels different and the product looks and smells different than the stuff I hav bought in the salon.
1,"bottle is same, contents may not be",I opened my product container and the inside contents does not seem the same as the original one I purchased from the store. I will not buy from this vendor again. I thought it was the same as the bottle looks brand new. Scent and consistency are NOT the same. Conditioner inside is NOT S Factor.
2,Works like any cheap conditioner...,"I have pretty curly and THICK hair that is hard to maintain. I'm always looking for different types of shampoos/conditioners every few months and somehow ran into this one. I can't say it made my hair smoother or shinier, but it did help me de-tangle my hair... so it pretty much worked like any other cheap conditioner. Very nice smell though."
5,Marlene singing English and German favorites,"Enjoy this music from the past; you will feel as if you are in small caberet, smoke rising, glasses clinking, voices hushed and everyone having a suburb time. We have three generations in our family hooked on Marlene because of this cd!"
3,"This is good, though a bit dry","This is certainly an interesting read, though leans a little more toward the empirical than I would like. I would like for there to be more ""guts"" in this: for example, WHAT did couples use for contraception at this time, rather than how many people were practicing some form of contraception. It is interesting, but leaves me wanting to know more than was covered in here."
5,"Dry, But Still the Best Source of Information","Given that I've got an extensive chapter on sex in the 1800s in my own book, I've read dozens of books on this subject. Janet Farrell Brodie's book remains the best one on contraception and abortion during the 1800s. (At that time, there was no distinction between contraception and abortion like we have today.) It's impossible to read more than a couple of pages of this book and not have your jaw drop yet again.Keep in mind that the author is a researcher, and a very fine one. So what you might miss in terms of an easy read is more than made up by scholarly excellence that you can trust and quote without hesitation."
4,hood crowning acceivment!,"i've owned and listened to all the hoods cds but this is the only one the truely stood out greatly to me.on this cd they have capured the true power of hood the writting has matured,the sound has more mid and bass to it and as a whole i feel this is the best they have yet to offer great hooks and breakdowns and some good speedtoo.!"
3,Nice family film.,"This is a nice movie, but the beginning is a little strange because Casper does not even know he is a ghost and its the second Casper film! The 1995 Casper (the first Casper movie), is definitly a better movie, with a way better plot. This movie has an okay cast, and a bad script. I don't recomend buying this movie. You should just watch it on t.v. and save some money. Overall, its a good movie, but not a good sequel.Take my advice."
5,Better Then The Theatrical Movie!,First off I want to say that before I watched the sequel Casper's Spirited Beginning I watched the original theatrical movie that starred Christina Ricchi and I thought it was boring but I liked this much better then the theatrical movie and didn't find it boring at all and I don't care that it's a made for television movie! This movie is funny and I like it!
1,Zero Stars,"They get one star because there is no zero stars. I bought this because it was a good price compared to other wedding sites. I guess you get what you pay for. Extremely poor quality. When I put this on, the word Bride stretches out and looks like it's been through the wash about a hundred times. The collar is up too high. I would return this, but I don't know how since it's through a third party vendor and with planning a wedding I don't have the time to hassel with this. My recommendation is to look elsewhere!"
3,too academic for executives.,"A lot of very basic information for someone who has never been exposed to the communication's issue in a corporation. In a very academic format, the different articles are not very useful when you are under time constraint, if you are an executive."
3,a ok collection year,I like to read nice short novels. And this collection is claimed to be the collection of the best of a year. Still a year might be a little too short to produce many great short novels. So overall I think it is just a OK collection.many pieces seems for literature critics only.about 30% of them is pretty good. you can find the trace of new century. Anyway the real good novels should appeal to both general readers and critics.
4,definitely worth reading,"I thought this was a great collection. Ironically, given the first of the reviews I read here, I thought ""Some Other, Better Otto"" was one of the best of all of them. It would have made the collection worth reading by itself.I could have quibbled a little with the inclusion of the seemingly fairly-pointless ""Docent"" and the kind of boring and unoriginal Updike story, but I think Moore did an excellent job of selecting stories, and the entire collection is worth reading."
1,Not in good condition,"Claimed to be in very good condition, but the book was heavily highlighted with yellow and pink, including some notes in the margins, I would not call that in ""very good condition"". Also, I was looking for edition #4 (that was my search), but received the 1st edition of it (turned out not to be a big problem). I asked this specific question to the seller, but did not get a response, but went ahead anyway since I needed the book quick, which I thought would happen since they were relatively close to me, and I paid to have it expedited. Wrong again, took 4 day to get in my hands, which was only suppose to take 1 or 2 days to get to me. For the price it is hard to complain, but overall I was still very unsatisfied."
3,Bought this for a Master's Degree class...,This book was cheaper to buy over Amazon than at the University of Maryland bookstore so I did...
4,X poems in search of an author,"The 'missing' link between Sylvia Plath and Sharon Olds, Jong displays an undoubted facility but somehow lacks focus or channel. Right at the end, with From the Country of Regrets, she appears to toy with an original direction. I don't have a problem with the other reviewer's 'thrilling', but Margaret Atwood has talked tellingly of conjuring tricks. Or is it that the message of Seventeen Warnings in Search of a Feminist Poem (still a damn fine poem, by the way) is by now too familiar? I see Jong's written four more books - hmm. It's perhaps indicative that no room is found for her among the 250+ contributors to that sterling 2008 anthology Women's Work. My favorite here, the invective of Seventeen Warnings excepted, is the quiet little cameo The Heidelberg Landlady"
2,Ok Video but over priced. Worth about $12.00,"Haven't surfed yet so I bought the video. First don't be fooled, this is one DVD broken into two chapters and not very long. Some areas are very very elementary and the information is given to slowly while other areas such as wave formulations and math are shot right through. Also I didn't learn much from the minutes of footage of people walking down the beach with a board and I have rewind so I shouldn't have to watch the same mediocre footage over and over. On a 1 to 10 scale it's about a 3 and worth about 10 to 15 bucks. I learned about the same from y-tube. Good intention, poor application."
5,"No thong bikinis, but great instruction and oceanography","This DVD has all the stuff that's really hard to learn when you're just learning how to surf. The oceanography part includes info that's hard to find and you probably don't know unless you studied physics. I really appreciated that the instruction and all the information was substantial -- everybody knows that surfing is fun, but it's also can be really hard. This video really helps you understand what's goin' on: in the oceanography part I liked going back and forth between motion graphics and film of the ocean and surfers. The quality of the film and the sound (groovy sound track) and the professionalism and experience of the surfers featured in the DVD is way beyond the average surf instructor. I haven't seen any instructional surfing DVD with this much info! Nothing compares with this one."
1,The worst surf movie of any kind ever made,"Re-uses the same terrible footage over and over, has very little , if any, instructional value. No one could possibly learn how to surf from this video, nor could it even be used as an instructional aid . Completely worthless !!!"
3,Small....,This book is beautiful! My only complaint is that it is tiny! The book is approx. the size of a 3 1/2 x 5 picture. I had just hoped that it would be larger. That is definitely something that I wish was included in the description. Other than that............GEORGEOUS!!!!!!!!
5,from a TG fan...,"Great live recording from the one true original pioneer of industrial music. 100% assault on your senses, this is truely an amazing document of TG's might and sonic power. The sound quality on the live series cd's is excellent, you won't be disappointed.If you are in a budget and can't afford the expensive box set, the TG Live series is a an excellent buy for fans old and new. Collect them, I have, it's all worth it."
5,so dirty it needs a shower,"This album is absolutely disgusting... if you like that new heavy house sound, then this compilation is for you."
5,De lo mejor que podes encontrar,"Este album es de lo mejor, es un buen trabajo, definitivamente una pieza que no te aburres de escuchar!!!"
3,Why not 5 stars?,"I really like this film and I appreciate the scholarly approach of the DVD. But with all that, why was not the intregrity of the of the original format -- the frame -- considered more relevant when the transfer was made to the DVD format. Compare the scenes on original trailer on the DVD to the same ones in the movie and you'll see that part of the picture is missing."
4,Bora-Bora Tale,"Of the thirties of the last century, this story is of Bora-Bora Romeo and Juliet with a similar tragic end.As aLegong - Dance of the Virgins, it is interesting for both depicting then locals in their natural environment from a historical perspective and a way CIVILISED movie-makers had done it."
3,Time will tell...,Interesting ideas. I'm not totally sold on Morgan's theories. I do think as our meathods of science become more advanced we will get closer to solving the mystery. I would still reccomend this book however. Morgan does seem to know her stuff.
5,"We swim, love water; apes and monkees climb","Ms. Morgan is onto the truth. Mankind evolving from an aquatic background seems offbeat until you realize that several human attributes can only be explained by the Aquatic Ape Theory. There are multudinous indicators that at some point in our past we survived an aquatic evnironment and Ms. Morgan brings them to print in her book ""The Scars of Evolution."""
5,Amazing truth,"It's so obvious, it should be learned in school! The aquatic ape theory is the only one that explains anomalies in human behavior, anatomy and evolution."
4,Entertaining read,"Paul Wellman, journalist and author, has compiled here a rousing tale of some of the better known outlaws of the early west. He traces a line beginning with Quantrill and ending with Pretty Boy Floyd. I found the sections dealing with the James and Younger Gangs and then the Dalton and Doolins to be the most interesting. Some other reviewers question some of Wellman's facts and conclusions but I do not have the expertise to comment on that. The writing was well-paced and entertaining. Recommended at least as a starting point."
5,Daughter's boyfriend very pleased,He's in a band and apparently these are robust strings but comfortable for frequent play and seem to remain in tune without need of tweaking for lengthy periods of time. Don't play bass myself but wish that were true of twelve strings.
5,Perfect intersections are now simple!,"I had never been a huge fan of paper piecing before. It seemed silly to cut ""hunks"" of fabric and sew them to paper, trim them up and then have to pin and fuss to get the segments to end up just right. The cutting was wasteful, the pins made lumps and the matching...aargh! All those problems are addressed with this new method of paper piecing. I teach quilting and have taught three classes now using this book. Students of all levels are able to successfully compete their projects. Be warned, however, that this book is available in two sizes depending upon the edition. For accurate templates and patterns be sure you are purchasing the 9"" wide edition."
4,Nice addition to my library,"This is a nice addition to my quilt book library. LOTS of VERY detailed instructions to learn her paper piecing technique. My only issue with this book is the instructions are 100% for HER patterns & techniques. I'm just beginning paper peicing & I don't think I'll be able to adapt her techniques to my other patterns...I'll have to concentrate on instructions to attempt this. Or better yet, I think I'll find a basic paper piecing book. :)"
3,disappointing.,I did not find it simpler than regular paper piecing. It was a disappointment. I would not buy it again.
3,Translucent pattern paper in my printer does not work!,"The book is not helpful when it instructs people to use translucent pattern paper in the printer to copy the patterns. My Canon MP610 printer, which is only a few months old, now has a piece of translucent paper wound around the internal paper feed roll and I cannot reach it to remove it. I will likely have to take my printer to a repair service to get the paper out."
2,I wish I could understand the instructions,"I don't know if it's just me or what, but I have a hard time with the instructions, but I also haven't made anything in this book. I thought the author was providing a quicker way to construct blocks, but I didn't think so. It just looks like alot more time and work than what's necessary."
4,Casca's Persian Adventures,"Casca returns from the Chinese empire and runs into Shapur II, the reigning king of the Persian Empire. Almost against his will, Casca joins the empire and becomes one of its greatest generals. As a whole, this story weaves good historical fact research with excellent military strategy. The battle scenes in this book are well planned and completely original. The major fallback to this novel is the woman whom Casca falls for. The story lacks a strong romantic base, and the romance detracts from the storyline and the series in general. All in all, this title lives up to the series name and Sadler's writing ability."
1,Hate It! Hate It! Did I Say I Hate This Flashlight!!!,"After reading all of the favorable reviews, I went ahead and spent the money and bought this flashlight. I got it and saw that it didn't take batteries (maybe I missed that part in the reviews). After using up every bit of my energy turning that da*(&$#rn crank, the flashlight stayed lit a total of 2 min!!! My arm was so tired from turning that crank. I would have much preferred batteries (I'll go to the gym for arm workouts -thank you). Geesh I wish I hadn't thrown away the box in my excitement, because I just want to get rid of this toy. If it had batteries or the light stayed lit a sufficient amount of time, this would have been a great first flashlight. [...]"
1,Never Again,"I never received the order. I tried repeatedly to contact the seller, with no response.The only redeeming factor is that Amazon arranged for a full refund."
1,Dissapointing....,"Okay, first of all ? I would like to say something here...Im i the only one who thought that mindrot's soul sounded like a soulfly album ? Or any other crappy nu-metal band ? I know that i did enjoy the album dawning but i do not know what happen between this two albums. It just sounds horrible and insted of metal you actullie hear nu-metal! Don't bother...Get dawning insted."
5,Politics of the Golden State,"This is a great textbook, if you are teaching a whole cooure in California politics, or if you give at least two weeks in your American Politics class to California politics. There is a lot of content here, and some good photographs, too. The book contains more information than Gerston's and Christensen's ""California Politics: A Practical Approach"" (see one of my previous review to learn more about this book), but Gerston and Christensen make a better use of empirical data than Lawrence.If you feel like going for a lot of information on California politics, then pick up this book. Also, be aware that in addition to facts, this book does theorize from beginning to end, which is something not found in Gerston and Christensen. The book is an easy reas and it puts histroical and political information into a cogent theoretical framework. I certainly recommend it to people wishing to learn more about the politics of the Golden State."
2,Not USB connected!,"I was surprised to receive this keyboard and find that it didn't connect to my new Windows notebook computer. It has a PS2 connection, not USB or any other type connection that my notebook accepts. I went back and looked at the description and I don't see anywhere currently where it states what connector it has. Buyer beware!"
2,NOT USB and cannot work with commands,"I wish I had noticed the review that said this is not USB!! I had to find a PSII to USB adapter! Also, since I have to use the adapter, command control buttons such the calculator do NOT work!! BLAH!! STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE!!"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Jacky is in trouble again.Now, if you were going to have a new character come along to help out, why not Johnny? Yep, that is the one. Apparently the moon is chockful of the magic stuff that the faerie types need to get along, and a bad guy decides to basically nick it all for himself.Enter your heroic musician type (of a sort), to try and help out and put things right.Not as good as the other book."
1,doesn't live up to title or editor's description,"when i ordered this book i thought it was going to discuss the symbols it collected about the zodiac... well, it didn't. it does an average job of listing alot of trivial information about the various symbols associated with each sign of the western zodiac, but it says nothing about how these associations came about, nor does it really focus on anything the would render the zodiac charming, beautiful, or fascinating. this is a list of colors, flowers, and birds not an examination of symbology. what it boils down to is a few skimpy lists that look like about as much effort went into them as a 3rd grader's book report"
2,Nothing new,The theme of this book is not new. The plot goes out of the main story explaining surgeries that nobody'll do unless a M.D. and that gets boring. The way Kathleen saves herself is a fairytale and the way Dr. Morris and Dr. Downs save their selves is pathetic.
4,Marriner's Magnificent...Mendelssohn?,"To finish that classical music alliteration, most fans would probably select Mozart as the composer. After all Sir Neville's contribution to the movie ""Amadeus"" is arguably for what the conductor is best known. Of course, aficionados realize there is much more to Marriner, and these early Mendelssohn works are right in his wheelhouse. Written by the composer when he was only a teenager, the String Symphonies have more in common with the classical period than the romantic in their sound and style. The same goes for the Piano Concerto in A minor, which is a far cry from the fully developed later Piano Concertos (which in turn, in my opinion, leave much to be desired versus the masterpiece that is the Violin Concerto). However, all four pieces are performed wonderfully here, and pianist John Ogdon is in excellent form. This CD is not a great place to start for either the composer or the conductor, but it is very rewarding for a devotee of both."
4,Good toy. a little loud for me.,"My 1 year old liked this toy instantly. She's been playing with it for over a month now. I wish I could lower the volume on it. It has animal sounds, counting and simple words like stop and go. I wish they had different music for the horn in the middle of the steering wheel. I'm sick of listening to the same sound over and over again, but as long as my baby has fun with it I'm ok."
3,Road rage for Toddlers,"This was given to our son as a gift. He loves it. We do not.He likes the sounds and moving the wheel and gear shifter. We don't like how rude the voices are. Instead of saying ""Outta my way"" they didn't really need any comment after honking the horn. And instead of demanding ""fill it up!"", using please wouldn't have hurt. It's hard enough to teach manners without toys undermining the effort."
1,Rude and demanding language,"Having had many great Vtech toys, I bought this for my daughter at about 9 months. The first day, I wished I had never bought it. This toy teaches children poor manners and rudeness. When you push the horn it yells, ""Outta the way!"" When you hit the gas button it yells, ""I'm outta gas! Fill 'er up!"", in a very demanding tone. I would not recommend this toy to anyone and can't believe that a toy company would even manufacture something so socially unacceptable. It went in the garbage because my conscience wouldn't let me sell it to someone else."
3,v tech,"My son likes the toy but the steering wheel is kind of hard. its not that easy to turn to the sides, even for myself."
1,Rude Toy!,"How is a toy rude, you ask? When you honk the horn, some bratty kids sounds off yelling, ""Out of the way!"" When I heard that, I decided to get rid of it for the simple fact that I don't want my son learning to say that phrase. It sounds like some road raging kid behind the wheel. I think the toy in itself is cute, great concept, music, durability, it's just that I don't want my son to grow up to be a road rager. And I am just being sarcastic with that comment, so don't take it seriously."
1,Rude Little Fellow!,"I usually like V-Tech, but this one missed the mark! My 1 year old liked it--for about 10 minutes. he'd play with it sporadically over the next few weeks, but I found myself hoping he wouldn't. The voice is a demanding little kid, screaming, ""Outta the Way!"" and ""Fill 'er up!"" I relegated the thing to the car, hoping maybe he'd like to turn the steering wheel when I drive, but the ""on"" switch is hyper-sensitive, and every time we'd go over a bump in the road, the !@#$ thing would turn on! And the worst part is, it doesn't have an auto-shut off feature. It just keeps making noise! Oh, and the volume is LOUD, too! Save your money!"
3,Toddlers' Delight!,"Bought this for my 8 month old grandson...thought it would be a great car toy. The voices and sounds are cartoon quality and LOUD...the boy loved it. Not so, his parents who finally ""lost"" it in the garage. When he carried it back into the house for his now 8-month-old brother, much delight for both boys...for one day. Riding in the car when this toy is in play is misery for any adult. The only toy ever bought that his parents HATE."
2,Very loud and obnoxious toy,"Ugh, I don't care for this toy at all. I was looking for a driving toy and thought this one would be fun, but my son (9 months) and I both find it annoying. First, it's deafeningly loud, even on the quieter setting. Second, the sounds are far too startling and far too many -- I can see him getting distressed after only 30 seconds or so. Having quieter, shorter noises that are actually caused by some action on the child's part would be much more enjoyable and educational. Third, as several other reviewers noted, the phrases it says make it a great training toy if you want your kid to be a total brat. I don't ever want to hear ""get outta the way!!"" escape my son's lips in that awful, demanding tone. I only give it two stars because he seems to enjoy examining it with the sound OFF (which is its now permanent state)."
2,Annoying,My 1 year old was given this for his birthday. Some of the phrases are rude. The songs are sung off key. The rollers don't always play the special song when there are 3 of a kind lined up. The car sounds are enough to make me batty. I don't see where it is teaching the child anything since it might say any one of three things for each picture. Is it the number? Is it the shape? Maybe this time it's going to be the animal. The low volume setting is still too loud. The only reason I've given it 2 stars instead of 1 is because my son likes this toy despite the fact that the loses interest after a few minutes..
3,An OK toy! Could be better,"I bought this 'driver' for my son when he was 5 months old. He loves playing with it, hitting the buttons etc. However, I find it a little too loud. And I agree with some reviewers that it should be educational, istead of saying 'out of the way' because the child listens to it and learns, and this kind 'talk' is not educational. But if you want to teach him early the functions of the car(driving) it is a great toy!"
2,"Should be called ""Li'l Road Rage""","I wish I had seen these reviews before buying this obnoxious toy for my 10 month old for Christmas. I agree with what other reviewers are saying; this toy barks rude orders like ""Outta the way!"" and demands that you ""Fill 'er up!!"" in an extremely snotty voice. It does sing a couple of traditional tunes, such as the alphabet song, but even the singing voice has attitude.So unless you want your little guy or gal to learn poor driving manners, steer clear of this toy (no pun intended)!"
1,rude toy,"My 17 month old son received this toy as a gift. This toy shouts rude things and unfortunatey he now says ""OUT OF THE WAY!"" thanks to this toy.....my husband calls it the New York taxi toy. I do not reccomend purchasing it."
3,Just So So,This toy is just so so. It was fun at first but then both of my kids lost interest in it. We still have it an occasionally they pull it out to play with it. The educational value is limited. I'm sure there are better toys out there.
3,okay - loses interest quickly,"I'm usually a fan of Vtech - and when a friend got this toy for her 6 month old, I was interested in it. We bought it for my 6 month old son for Christmas and he was excited to play with it for 30 minutes or so - and now it just takes up space in the toy box. He barely plays it and rarely seems interested. It's not even that educational - and it constantly seems to be going off while it's just resting in the toybox. I'd save your money and buy something more educational that would keep your baby's attention for more than a day."
3,Little annoying,"I've been spoiled with too many fisher price toys that have volume settings and this toy does not, loud or off. It does the job, let's my child steer and pretend to drive while I'm driving, but I thought I would love it more than I do. If I don't turn it off and I'm driving alone in the car it's very sensitive and just turns on, that's the annoying part."
2,"A lot of flash, but little substance","I purchased this toy for my 7 month old daughter, who is now 10 months, and I believe she has played with this maybe twice. This toy has so many buttons and noises that it seems like a great idea at the store, but getting it home is a completely different story. It is THE MOST chaotic and loud toy I have ever encountered, and not in a good way. With so many levers, buttons, wheels, and switches, my daughter is unable to touch the thing without 5 different commands going off. Any educational value in this toy is completely lost among all the commotion. No sooner than one animal noise begins, another song, or the horrendously annoying horn, overpowers it. My daughter and I both end up frustrated and overwhelmed with this annoying and LOUD toy."
4,"So loud and annoying, however...","This toy is soooo loud and annoying, but kids just love it!My son loved playing with his when he was little, so I ordered one for my niece for Christmas... Her mom was pleased with it when it arrived... We'll see how much she likes it after the kid gets to play with it on Christmas, he he he (<- evil laugh)It really is a great toy though, it kept my son and his friends entertained for long periods of time. It may be annoying, but as a parent it's beneficial to learn how to tune out the noises of annoying toys anyways."
3,RUDE TOY!,"I am with everyone else, this toy IS rude. What happened to teaching kids manners? The ""outta the way"" is so nasty. I don't like it. I wouldn't buy it again for my kids or anyone else."
2,Drive in the other direction...,"I purchased this toy for my son's first birthday and have regretted it ever since. I agree with the other reviews as far as loudness (very loud) and rudeness of the 'narrator' of the toy. I would never want my children saying ""get outta the way"" to anyone and I am in shock that the manufacturer would include this in a toy- especially for children who are beginning to aquire language skills (according to age recommendation for this toy). The most irritating aspect, for me as the parent, is when the ABC song comes on not only is it cut short but the voice singing it is so off-key it makes me cringe. I don't believe the spinning ABC/123s/Animals at the top of the toy are easy to follow for a young child either. I'm giving this toy two stars because my son (and his toddler sister) seem to like it but I'm tempted to throw it away because of all the negatives."
2,I Don't Like It,"This gift was given to my son as a gift. He doesn't yet play with it, but my 19 month old daughter does. It is loud and obnoxious. It says rude things. It is, in my opinion, sexist. It turn on too easily. It was in the floor and my dog kept making the thing talk when he would brush against it. If it were not a gift, I would have taken it back. Don't waste your money. It doesn't teach anything but bad manners."
2,Great toy but doesnt last long.,My son loved this toy but it broke after 3 weeks. Not very durable at all.
2,Read this before you buy.,"This toy has limited interest for my son. I bought it for him when he was 18 mos (he is now 2). He occasionally plays with it for maybe 5 minutes at a time. If you put it on a smooth surface (table, hardwood floor) it slides around when he tried to turn the wheel or pushes/pulls the gearshift. Also it is very LOUD and I find the tone of voice kind of rude: On the horn: ""out of the way"", on the gas button ""fill er up"" - but the tone of voice isn't nice it sounds like a rude little kid demanding that he be listened to....NOW. Except for the police button which says ""slow down little fellow"" the rest of them sound like spoiled brats! Not recommended."
1,Annoying and RUDE,"This toy is really rude! It says ""Outta the way"" and other very rude phrases. I can't believe anyone would produce a toy like this and think it was okay. This toy got a home at the bottom of a garbage can."
3,review,"My daughter is 19 months and obsessed with driving. I finally broke down and bought her this since all the others I saw in the stores didn't seem to teach anything other than how to turn the wheel or honk the horn. While I like that it teaches a few letters/numbers/shapes, I really dislike the phrases they used. They clearly did not design this toy with girls in mind, or the intention of encouraging polite children. I think they could have used phrases more like ""Excuse me, coming through"" or ""Slow down there, kiddo"" instead of ""out of the way"" and ""little fella"". My girl is definitely NOT a fella.We do use it when we go shopping so she can ""drive"" the shopping cart and let me shop in peace, and so far it hasn't broken, and the batteries are going strong. Overall it is a pretty good buy for the price."
4,Slubba Slubba Slooow it doooown!,My son has this toy at grandpa's and it keeps him entertained for a few minutes at a time. We can't expect an electronic device to hold an 18 month old's attention. They have things to do!
4,Worth buying one,"When be brought this toy home for our daughter (who is 8 months) she did not play with it for couple of days. We thought it is going to be ignored by her. However, very soon she started playing with it.This toy has three modes of music and lot of other options for the kids to try. It has a steering wheel, a hold to push and pull, few buttons and mode change options.Many toys have the same music repeated over and over which you get bored very soon. However this toy has 3 modes so you have more options for music. Also cos it has different controls it gives opportunity for the kid to try different things.I keep this toy on our carpet floor and she enjoys playing with it.However I am giving it only 4 rating cos it occupies her only for about 20-30 min and then she moves off to the next toy. But this toy is still worth buying cos kids will love to play with this from time to time."
1,Steering wheel broken by 11month old,"My Grandson loved playing with this but Yesterday we had a very scarry incident. While playing with this the steering wheel broke into 3 pieces. I didn't see it actually happen, just glad I saw this before he was hurt. VERY sharp pieces, Broke in 3 parts, Very dangerous!!! I can't imagine how an 11month old could do this..but he did. I have searched for a recall but have not seen anything so far...Will be calling Vtech today. Just be careful if your child has one of these!!!"
4,Keeps my little one entertained,"This toy does keep my little one engaged for 15 minutes ! Though he literally stands on it and sometimes bangs it, I dont see a problem in it. Batteries last quite well ( atleast till now ) .. so overall m happy about it.. Got it at a great price near christmas !"
1,Died in a day and wasn't worth the return,"The educational factor really doesn't exist other than that it speaks and maybe your child will imitate it. The pictures are too small and confusing to make the connection between the word and the picture. So, if you're looking for something educational, skip this one. It lights up and makes noise and entertained my one year old, but he likes anything that sings. For the price, that is fine. Unfortunately, the toy died in less than a day. One second it was making noise the next second it was done. Since this was a gift from out of state grandparents we couldn't return it to the store and so we called VTech for a replacement. Long story short you're required to pay one way shipping to get the toy to the company which means at best you're paying over 2/3 the original retail cost of the toy to get a replacement that may or may not last. We are going to just use that money to buy him something from a different company."
1,Terrible quality - Broken in a week!,Within just a week of owning this toy it started having problems. The sounds stopped working (the lights would work) and then the problems quickly escalated. I believe that when the on switch is turned to the on position it is not making a complete connection. I called customer service and was disappointed that they couldn't do anything except tell me to replace the batteries (which I had). I lost the registration card so unfortunately this toy is just going in the trash. After several bad experiences with low quality vtech toys I will NEVER buy a Vtech toy ever again.
2,Went to Goodwill,"There are not many toys that I just cannot stand--but I could not BELIEVE how rude the sounds on this toy are! Did this pass ANY parent testing? V-Tech, it's disappointing. My daughter liked playing with the wheel, but I cannot deal with a toy teaching her rudeness."
5,Great toy for the price,We bought this toy when our daughter was 5 1/2 months old and she is now 8 1/2 months old. She has yet to stop playing with it. We've definitley got our money worth. I recommend it. It's fun and educational!!!
2,Rude little voice,"Although my son (18 months) loves the music & lights, the little voice that comes out of this toy is rude. ""Out of the way!"" and ""fill 'er up!""....I would correct my son if he were to speak to anyone with that tone. Durable & cute to look at, but not cute to hear."
1,Teaches how to be RUDE!,"Sheesh! This toy is fairly durable (stickers can come off of course though) - but other than that, I am NOT impressed.Sure as another reviewer stated, a 6 mth old will not ""get"" the attitude the voice has in the toy - but who wants to hear an attitude being projected to your kiddo at any age???I tried to sell this at a garage sale for $1. Needless to say - many of my other toys sold - this one went to the local thrift store! ... I shoulda thrown it away though."
1,My ears hurt,"I had fallen in love with an older version of this toy and so I got my son a new one. Such a mistake.1. The voices are rude (get out of the way! - Just plain rude, I'm out of Gas! - like it is someone else's problem, slow DOWN little fellow - please, be more condescending)2. The songs are OFF KEY3. The learning bit is so deemphasized.I mean, my kid will play with anything with a steering wheel on it, but honestly. I can't give this thing away fast enough. Too bad. We love VTech toys in general."
5,Excellent toy,My Kid liked it a lot and enjoying it. She is able to understand the difference from one action to the other.
5,One of the most engrossing books I have ever read!,"""Miss Willie"" is a delightful story about a school teacher who moves from a big city to a very small community in the hills of Kentucky.Easy to read, this book kept me spell bound untilI finished it. A real treat for readers of all ages"
4,Adventure and thrills,"This is a great, old-fashioned adventure thriller with terrific locaton filming which adds a real air of authenticity to the whole proceedings. The DVD is bare-bones but great quality - anamorphic widescreen 2.35:1 taken from a very nice, sharp, colourful print free of defects.If you love old British adventure movies like this and ""Northwest Frontier"", check this one out. It's dirty, sweaty and gritty, and always entertaining."
2,"Good idea, Boring movie.","As many of the other reviews point out, that the concept of everybody losing thier memories is a good one. The sad part is that the story kind of drags on. The only people with memories are the ones that had memories implanted, saved somehow due to cybernetic implants, and one mysterious lady in which she is not all that she appears to be. Although the story kind of slow, it does make you think for a while.Basically, an alien race was experimenting with Earth. They see how creative we can be with our buildings and machines. The aliens simply took all the memories of man, as our language and knowledge of tools, just to see how we would behave."
1,R U SERIOUS!,this movie is so bad you cant imagine..i dont know how people actually rated it more than 1..it doesnt have a good story...when you read it at first u think hey this is cool..people who lost their memory..but after you watch it you really hate ur self ...i continued watching it cus i paied for it : (...it doesnt have a nice story..it doesnt have an ending..and most of all the charectors are so ugly u cant imagine..spare ur money and buy somethin else
3,"Well, the concept is there....","Needless to say, this anime isn't for everyone. Some may not understand the story, as it tends to jump around and the plot seems mixed up. However, the concept behind the story is fairly interesting. A wind that makes the world forget everything they ever knew, but the show jumps around so much, it seems to take them a while to actually tell you about it. The art style is nice, the animation solid and fluid. I haven't listen to the English Dub, so I won't comment on it.If you don't mind thinking through your anime, you should be fine. The show may move around a lot, but overall it isn't too bad."
4,December_me,"A truly wonderfull and emotionally deep movie, even if the animation is slightly antiquidated. The ideas and questions it presents can be a bit deep to someone who still thinks Anime are just silly cartoons, but movies like this should quickly dispell that.It's not one for war and violence buffs, and some of the timeing seemed a little off for some sound-effecets in the movie, but if your looking for something to ponder on a long day, or you have a friend who always complains about not ever having anything interesting to talk about... just watch this wonderfull tale and enjoy."
3,cookbook,The product I purchased was as stated in the item being viewed I was pleased and glad to get this book I had been looking for it for some time.
2,Received in poor condition,"I ordered the book as a gift for my daughter who is getting married. I received it in a very timley fashion, however the entire contents reeked of cigarette smoke and there were very visible stains on the top of the pages. I contacted the seller and she said they had a leak or something and she did not notice the stains. She contacted me very quickly and was very apologetic. I returned the book media mail. I have not checked to see if the expenses have been refunded. I am very skeptical about buying on line especially since the seller said the book was new."
5,Best Edition in the Series,"Of all the Good Housekeeping cookbooks I've had over the years, this one is the best. Comprehensive, wonderful recipes, techniques and illustrations are very handy for new cooks and seasoned cooks as well. I purchased 2 of these, kept one and gave the other as a gift. Both in remarkably good condition."
5,This CD is killer!,SO many good tracks you wont skip a single song. From reggae to dancehall to hip hop this is a great record! Buy it up.
5,"Great buy, a must have","A great record I can't stop listening since I bought it. Perfect mixture of reggae, dancehall, hip-hop... If you're a good fan of that kind of music and don't buy it, you'll regret it."
4,A long neglected master rediscovered on CD,"Though Sunforest may not be the very best album of Tom Rapp's ouput, at least half of the songs rank pretty close to his best. ""Love/Sex"" (Vonda Shepard should check this one out!) and ""Prayers of Action"" are my favorites here. The CD recording, however, does not improve on my old LP, and a couple of cuts sounded muddy, as they do on my LP. Despite that, this is a beautiful collection of songs that should have been rediscovered long before now. Tom's lyrics are achingly personal (and perhaps unfashionable for their time) and his singing got more expressive. (Having attending one of his concerts recently, I can say his singing is better than ever!) Though his previous album, Stardancer, is perhaps his greatest album, Sunforest certainly holds up extremely well. Well worth the purchase!"
4,The Poet Artist is now a Philadelphia lawyer,"We first heard of Tom Rapp and his group, Pearls Before Swine, on a Warner Brothers sampler album in the early 1970's. Rapp was an excellent writer who brought a new life to American folk music by adding classical layers from the past. Who else could set William Blake or W.H. Auden to music? Although SunForest is his last (we'll forget that mess the record company put out agaist Rapp's wishes), and certainly not his best effort, Rapp's music is very enjoyable and relaxing. I hear now he's a Philadelphia lawyer specializing in human rights cases. May he live a full life of dignity, and may the publishers reissue his extensive catalog on CD soon!"
5,Good Stuff,"Shannon McNally will be a name we'll hear more of in the future, but the real star here is guitarist Dave Easley. Living in New Orleans, I have the good fortune of seeing and hearing Dave play with Coco Robicheaux in the Faubourg Marigny. It's not out of the realm of possibility that he is the premier guitar player that no one has heard of in the U.S. today. If Ms Mcnally is smart, she will have him playing in the studio as well as in her future live performances. I know this probably sounds more like an Easley review rather than one on Shannon Mcnally, and by no means is this meant to take anything thing away from Shannon's talent, but he's one of the main reasons for the 5 stars! Buy and enjoy."
3,"One good song! ""No Matter What""","I would like someone to tell me where I can find the sheet music for ""No Matter What"" that is in the Notting Hill CD as sung by boyzone. They do a great job on that song but the others kind of run together."
4,Good book to start with,"I've used it for a couple of years in a three-day introductory courses about OOA/D and the 'students' found it easy to learn. It's good because it softly introduces to the concepts of object orientation keeping in mind the fact that many people worked for years in a 'functional' way. Also good because you can use it every day while making analysis. In fact it's a manual. The two examples (one about an airline system and another about vehicle categorization) are developed together with the various aspects of the methodology and this helps to understand how to apply it. It's good also because it clearly separates analysis from design concerns. Of course now shows its age, but can be a good introductory book."
4,A Classic,"This book is one of the classics on the subject. Coad and Yourdon have been among the pioneers on OO methodologies, and their one is a well respected account.What they provide is a complete methodology that covers all the software engineering phases, from analysis (with this book) to implementation (their OOP book).You'll find that specialized magazines routinely presents articles that compares various methodologies. In each of them you'll always find Coad-Yourdon one. For this reason, despite the book is a bit old-dated, it worths a read and, indeed, it can be easily red. You'll gain a better understanding of the modern OO literature, and some insights that are timeless."
1,Very Bad Purchase,"I own a fitness center and bought 6 of these bikes just as a trial along with 15 of our standard V-Bikes. The Momentum Bikes worked for a couple of weeks and then the tension knobs all broke. After months of hassle, the company sent new knobs and those have broke as well. The bikes have a wider then normal stance if you measure the inside of pedal to pedal. Many members complained of severe knee pain every time they rode on the Momentum bikes. Unfortunately, now in every class there are 6 empty bikes. The die hard spinners would rather not spin if they have to ride a Momentum. This was the worst equipment purchase I've ever made."
2,Squeaks like crazy,"Cons: This bike squeaks high pitch and horrible with each turn. I've only ridin the bike 3x since I got it and I love to cycle at the gym. You have to mail in the warranty. This thing has been squeaking since day one and calling the company doesn't help.. They take a message then call you back when you're not home. I want someone to fix it. I believe it would be a great bike if it weren't so annoying. Can't seem to trouble shoot and my husband believes it's a factory issue w/ something internal w/ the belt. I'm 5'7"" athletic 175 lbs, so I don't believe this is a weight issue.Pros: It was easy to put together, you'll need two people. It seems durable.I would love for someone from the company to call me so we can resolve this issue and I can write a better review. My zip code is 44146"
4,good all around sturdy spin bike,"I've used this bike for about a month.I can attest to it being a quality spin bike and a decent value for the amazon price.At 6'4"" 240, sturdiness waskey for me. I can stand and sprint on this with no fear of breakage. Due to the weight, it is rock solid and doesn't rock from side to side.The downsides are the seat and lack of adjustability in the handlebars. The seat is garbage, but fortunately any standard bike seat will fit it. Budget in a quality seat into purchase price.The lack of adjustability in the handlebars will only show up for taller riders. The seat can be raised quite high but not so the bars. As a result, you end up in a time trial like position which is uncomfortable.All things considered however I would recommend this to a friend."
5,worth the money,"Just received the bike and set up with super easy. less than 20 minutes. It's really solid and heavy duty, but after the second day of spinning, the left crank was clicking a bit and on the third day, it clicked a lot. Really annoying for a new product. had to deal with manufacturer directly. supposedly they sent out a new part and will have a local service come fix it. It's been over a week's wait. More to come."
3,Disappointed,"I got this bike Oct 7, 2010 and I was so excited. I notice that the pad on the right side dragged on the flywheel but I could deal with that. Now the tension system is not working. It took many efforts just to find out the phone # to Fitness Master. Amazon was no help at all. I called Fitness Master to only find out that my warranty was void b/c I never sent in the warranty card which i informed them there were only instructions and not a manual with the bike and no card. Did not matter that I had a receipt........STILL VOID. So now I have to pay to have a brand new 600.00 bike fixed.....yes I should have called when I did not get a manual but I sure didn't realize the warranty would be void. So if you purchase this bike, MAKE sure you mail the card in and get Fitness Master phone # b/c Amazon will not be able to help you once you get it. When working, this is a good bike. I would recommend ordering from a bike store."
2,Concert No No,"I was bitterly disappointed with this offering. I expected a concert and got a documentary. There is far too much interference by the inter-track comments, which results in an appalling lack of continuity. Why can't producers leave well alone and give us what we want - a performance? This is a vid to watch once when it could well have been one to view time and again. Don't they realise that all the rubbish added on is boring after the first time?>"
2,mary chapin carpender - jubilee,Too much talking on this DVD. I purchased it mainly to watch/listen to the song Jubilee and even though it's highlighted in the title the song does not appear in its entirety on the DVD. This DVD was a big disappointment.
3,"VOICE IS BRILLIANT, INSTRUMENTAL IS POOR, FAIR SONGS","Country rock is great, listening to this DVD which can be feeling of that ! But what about our mighty Joan Baez ? Disappointed that she was only appearing a few minutes in one of the titles WITHOUT SINGING, who arranged that ?! The instrumental part is quite weak, bass guitar is not powerful. The titles' melody nearly all the same, not much different."
5,Good for first-timers,"I have appreciated the Dummies series as the publisher has some fun with topics that we might not have a clue. Having coached both Little League and softball (ASA), I saw this book on the shelf and decided to buy it to see if there are any hints that I might have been missing. Overall, this book is excellent for those who are just starting out in the coaching world. Handling kids and knowing the sport can be quite tricky, especially when parents are part of the equation. I think looking this over before stepping onto the field (and looking like a ""dummy"") is a very wise investment of money and time. I pretty much experienced most of what he explained, but Wolff was very straightforward and to the point. I appreciated his insights and will consider using several of the tips that I had not thought of before. Parents, get out of your lawn chairs, quit complaining behind our backs, and help us other parents coach!"
4,Very useful for people with depression still having to work,"Working with major depression is a struggle. The book was useful on how to handle issues at work, who to tell, what to share and how to manage."
3,Self-help resource,I got this book thinking it would include more of a mental health/clinical approach of things to address in therapy. I currently hold this book to give to my adult clients who could use help with thinking about work and struggling with depression. It is very straightforward and easy to read. It does a great job of describing your legal rights as an employee and I think that portion is often missed. It is a good self-help resource based on personal experience and advice giving.
1,NOT About Selling Cranberry Juice!,"This CD has absolutely NOTHING to do with selling cranberry juice. It's a trick. It is really about selling ""information"" over the internet. If you are interested in that, then buy it. But know that you are first being tricked by the title, so I don't know if I would trust the product. I bought it and threw it away."
1,"Professor Cummings, What happened to you?","As a PhD student on Korean studies and as someone who has read all your books, I was taken aback by your most recent edition. How, in God's name, did he come to your conclusions? Unfortunately for the North Koreans, even our own academia is given the green light to the most oppresive regime to date. I recommend that people read other documents such as North Korean human rights watch or Amnesty International."
1,Another polemic from Bruce Cumings,"Bruce Cumings is, sadly, one of the foremost scholars of Korea in the US. In some sense, he is the American apologist for the Kim regime. He states in another work that it would be good had the Kim regime gained control of the whole peninsula. Then, perhaps, they would have moderated in the sense that China and Vietnam had moderated.It is an outlandish suggestion, as China and Vietnam are still controlled by Communist parties who are effective at quashing all dissent. It is hardly a moderate stance.He gushes about North Korea's health care, housing, and all the rest. He glosses over the appalling human rights abuses of the Kim regime. One could very easily imagine him playfully holding up cards in the stadium at the latest North Korean mass games. He really should not be taken seriously as a scholar of Korea. He is to Korean scholarship what Ward Churchill is to ethnic studies."
3,"Introspective, interesting, unending","Still have a hard time with a book named ""Panama"" that takes place 98% in Paris. But, nonetheless, a thoughtful, introspective book about a historian-detective who does more complex thinking and wandering about churches than making ""blood flow to Panama."" Not for action-seekers or beach readers, but not bad for a cold northeastern winter night"
2,Panama Misses All Objectives,"Panama tries to be both a thriller and a social commentary. It is neither. Too slow for a thriller, the author bypasses all opportunities to make this book interesting. The socialcommentary is only barely relevant, and bored me except for a few interesting spots. We are destined to see a lot of this book in used book stores. Definitely not a keeper."
2,Grand idea falls short,"Zencey tires his best to create a mood a la Our Man in Havana, but ultimately fails. This book instead trips over itself in just about every chapter until you can't wait to finish just so you don't feel guilty about not finishing"
2,Couldn't wait to put it down.,"""Panama"" is about as slow-moving as it gets. The author took six long paragraphs to describe a man's reaction to being arm-in-arm with a woman. I don't have enough hours in my life for this. Couldn't finish it. However, if you like endless references to historical figures with your murder mystery, ""Panama"" might be of interest"
2,Not worth your time!,"I only made it through the first 45 pages before I decided that there were better ways to spend my time. The author's need to describe every detail really bogs the story down and challenges the reader to stay interested. If you're looking for a better story, read ""The Alienist""."
2,One of the Top Ten most overrated books I have read,"This was a N.Y. Times notable book, and it was reviewed favorably by a score of other ""literary critics"". I love a good period piece but this book feels like it was written with a nineteenth century reference book and some contrived crime scenes. Read ""Sacred Hunger"" by Barry Unger for a taste of how a historical mood is created."
1,Panama? Wrong,"This book was a big disappointment, first in that it barely takes place in Panama and has very little to do with the Panama Canal (as its title implies), and second in that it was a very boring read. Other reviewers have done an excellent job of capturing the lack of enjoyment I had in reading this book."
4,An excellent literary thriller.,"As you will see from many of the customer reviews, this historical thriller is not a purely plot-driven page-turner, a la Robert Ludlum or Ken Follett. If that is what you are looking for, you will be disappointed. Rather, the author takes the time (and, yes, forces the reader to do so) setting a mood, at the same time capturing the spirit of the age and the tormented inner spirit of the protagonist (Henry Adams). This is first and foremost a book about Adams' emotional recovery, so, no, it is not as fast-paced and action-packed as The Alienist. (I liked both books very much, but they are different--perhaps the marketers are at fault for raising false expectations.) But, so long as you are willing to savor a mood, and to arrive slowly at your destination, this is an excellent read."
4,lavish setting and atmosphere,"When I read the book, I thought it only moderately well written and mildly entertaining. A year later, however, I still recall scenes and commentary developed by Zencey. Recommended if you enjoy a richly described period piece and commentary on historical stages in an entertaining, if not completely engrossing, package"
1,Cheaply Designed Shovel Scoop,"I may do a lot of shoveling, but I have not used this much except for scraping and it is already broken after 1 month. The whole shovel scoop area that connects to the handle is cracked badly. If you want something that will last, get a steel bladed pusher, this cannot even slide along the surface easily. It is a waste of your precious money, invest in a quality shovel. God bless!"
5,Such an historic band.,"I bought this unsual yet very great album by nile named ""Amongst the catacombs of nephren-ka"" ...Something that i cherish as well as learn more about the egyptian text is when i pruchase any nile work.They told to explain why i like the album wel, it has all the right elements of deathmetal,grind, and egyptian sounds thats basicaly why i enjoy their music so much. I know most of you don't know what nile means so i'll let you know... The name ""nile"" comes from the exact etymology of the name of the great river of ""egypt derived from greek neilos is uncertain. You all can go in the libary and purchase the book "" the oxford companion to the bible"" if you realy want to know more about what nile actullie stands for what they are about as well as getting to know more about god and history... Because i know young kids like something yet they dont know what it represents. Learn it !In the process of learning also buy all of nile's work ok ? Laters !"
5,How do you rate near perfection?,"This album near approaches the perfect mix of brutality, technicality, and musicianship for death metal. It is difficult to describe the experience of listening to this album. The brutal death metal sections mesh perfectly with the Egyptian stylings. Death metal well suits the ancient Egyptian theme, as the culture may well have been mystical and highly advanced, but it was also violent, harsh, and brutal. The standard of music and appeal of some of the musicianship is such that I have been able to play it to non-metal fans, and they have been able to appreciate it, if not actually like it. Many death metal bands do Nile a great dis-service by comparing them to such one dimensional death metal bands as Cannibal Corpse, Deicide, and Suffocation. Nile is so much more than any of those bands. Nile is in a class of it's own."
4,Egypt has come to the Death Metal reign,"Nile is a technical and fast death metal band. Amongst the Catacombs of Nephren-Ka is an extreme album: the songs are brutal, fast and technicaly impecable. Their lyrics are about Egyptian stuff and they do it right.01. Smashing the Antiu 5/502. Barra Edinazzu 4/503. Kudurru Maglu 4/504. Serpent Headed Mask 5/505. Ramses Bringer of War 5/506. Stones of Sorrow 4/507. Die Rache Krieg Lied Der Assyriche 3/508. Howling of the Jinn 4/509. Pestilence and Iniquity 4/510. Opening of the Mouth 5/511. Beneath Eternal Oceans of Sand 4/5Recommended if you want to hear death metal in a different way."
4,DIFFERENT YET CATCHY RIFFS,"This is a slightly different sound from the Six feet Under,Sepultura,and Nailbomb death metal I'm use to listening to. Amazinginly its heavier than Cannibal Corpse yet has a steady groove in most of the songs. The riffs are heavier and somewhat catchier than riffs in most death metal bands. I would have to say for a local South Carolina band it ROCKS!!"
5,A New Breed of Death Metal,"This album is excellent. From the explosive opening track ""Smashing the Antiu"" to the closing dirge ""Beneath Eternal Oceans of Sand,"" Nile take you on a black voyage through the treacherous realms of Ancient Egypt and Sumeria. Incredibly well done, this album never gets boring nor is there a dull moment to be found. One of the many reasons for that is Nile's incredible musicianship and talent. The guitar players utilize tones of the middle east to to forge their sound. They also re-introduce solos to death metal. The drummer is super phenomenal, and bass player is good, too. The vocals are unique, bizarre, and like you have never heard before. Furthermore, this album has the excellent production needed to bring it to life. Overall, this album is bound to go down in death metal history as one of the greats!"
5,Good Stuff,"If your tired of all the cannibal corpse wannabes, get this album to keep you going. It is heavy as hell, but under complete control. Some parts are even heavier than cannibal corpse. the footwork on the bass drums is tight and precise to infinity. The guitar and bass both are at just the right ambience, and their is a lot of egyptology behind it. Buy the damn cd or suffer.THE CRYPTKEEPER"
5,Why can't I give this album more than 5 stars?,"This band F***ING rules! Totally brutal! I read about these guys and with all the hype surrounding these guys I had to find out what all the fuss was about. Holy SH**! I found myself getting pumped up and my blood raced through my veins upon first listened to this CD. This band ranks up there with Morbid Angel and Sinister. A must for all who crave fast, brutal, heavy as S**T death metal. Go get this one NOW!!!!"
5,Nothing but Heavy Death,"A very cool cd to say the least. It's a revolutionary cd for this time and age. Still showing people you can blend different music types and still come out with a great album. Remember people said Korns tone and Limp Bizkits would never make it? Well forget them, their to weak in the music world anyways. But the Nile CD has a very high tempo pace to it, it's one of the cds that makes you want to get up and do something. This isn't for all people, if your into Death metal, maybe Slipknot you may like it. Thanks for reading."
4,"RHYTHMIC AS METALLICA, BUT 20 TIMES FASTER & MORE BRUTAL!!!","I really like the rhythm and sounds of the instruments and the tunes Nile comes up with, the instruments are as I like them in speed metal and the like. I also love the egyptian spin on this music. However, along with that egyptian music, comes egyptian lyrics, so on the downside, it's not a sing along group.I have a hard time liking the vocals, they are among the deepest and most brutal I've ever encountered, and while many may enjoy that, I'd like a phrase that actually sticks in my mind, or something I can follow the words to.I'm particularilly fond of speed metal, the faster the better, but I want lyrics that are awesome, and decipherable. I really likeStatic-X. I realize Nile is death metal, not speed metal, but I still love they're instrumental talents!If you are looking for something fast and intensely brutal, you've got to pick up one of the Nile Cd's, this is a good one to start with!"
2,Horrible Death Metal vocals.,The music is good with lots of Egyptian music mixed in but the vocals are the worst Death Metal vocals I have ever heard.
1,THE WORST DamN DM! nile - Laughable!,"I find it hilarious that most people worship this as some kind of cult death metal release, but it's really some watered-downed happy-clean death metal! The vocals are boring and un-creative, the guitar playing isn't very aggressive & it's sometimes boring, the drums are about average, I'd rather hear my 7 yr. old brother bang on something. The whole Egyptian inspiration is SO-try-hard, It's not even funny! I'm sure nile have little fantasies about being rock-stars, look at ALL the attention they're getting... These guys might as well go to MTV, or start selling their Cds at Walmart!C'mon people check ""NO"" next to my review, that would make me feel quite wonderful! I recommend this album to humanitarian metal-heads, and trend lovers everywhere!"
1,nile - A Joke!,"I find it hilarious that most people worship this as some kind of cult death metal release, but it's just some really watered-downed commercialized-happy-clean death metal. The vocals are boring & repitive, the guitar playing isn't very aggressive, the drumming average, the whole egyptian thing is SO-try hard, It's not even funny! The attention their getting is ridiculios & I'm sure nile have fantasies about being rock-stars! C'mon, people, check ""NO"" next to my review, that would make me feel quite wonderful! I recommend this album to, humanitarian metal-heads, and trend lovers everywhere!"
1,The drummer needs a lesson from Limp Bizkit,The drummer is obviously lacking the talent and charisma that Talented drummers like Limp Bizkit and Linkin park.
4,"Pretty good, but not great","This is a pretty solid death metal album. It has a unique-ness about it that makes it appealing, however, it's not really great. Gets rather boring rather quickly. Better than most death metal bands, but not as good as some. If I had to rate my favorite DM albums, the list would be something like: 1.)Cryptopsy-Whisper Supremecy 2.)Suffocation-Effigy of the Forgotten 3.)Cannibal Corpse-Bloodthirst 4.)Cannibal Corpse-The Bleeding 5.)Suffocation-Pierced from Within6.)Nile-Amongst....A pretty good album for any death metal head."
5,a new classic metal album,"awesome, this is a band that you need to keep your eye on. they have the best live shows. don't know why i waited so damn long to get this album, you should get it now."
5,"By far, the best death metal band since they came along","This album blisters your mind, from beginning to end. Nile play with such precision and such strength, it's just jaw-dropping. They're the best death metal band to come along since they first arrived. Don't believe it? Check this album out and see why. It's short, but just scathing."
4,very good cd,this cd has excellent drums. the guitar riffs are spectacular and the solos are great. the vocalist is a bit unoriginal and his lyrics are dumb but the music rules. i suggest all of you reading this buy this album. the only drawback is that two songs (3 and 7) are stupid instrumental songs. the rest is just techincal brutality.
1,Far and away his worst book- don't bother,"Very slow, very boring and very, very self-congratulating. Probably hurt his arm patting himself on the back so much. I'm a huge Mandino fan but I couldn't get past this bit of braggadocio. Fortunately, I got the book as Christmas present(yes, I asked for it), so I don't feel as cheated as I would if I'd have bought it myself. How the author of such great books as The Christ Commission and The Greatest Salesman in the World can put out such garbage is beyond me. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK"
3,More like charms than ornaments,"Still okay for the money I paid, but I think they are somewhat small to be like the Lenox ornaments I have. The plastic envelope itself said ""HOLIDAY GIFT CHARMS""."
4,"Nice product, but not as nice as expected.","I purchased these for a gift exchange at work. We were supposed to buy a $15 gift. When these arrived, they were in a cheap plastic container and didn't look anything like a $15 gift. The product itself was nice enough, but the packaging looked like something you'd pay $4.99 for. I ended up sitting out the gift exchange and kept the ornaments myself."
5,Christmas Ornaments,"I got this for my step-sister for her wedding shower. We all got ornaments for ""their first Christmas."" I was worried how they would look, but they turned out to look very nice, little procelian looking ornaments. And she liked them to."
4,Nice and super fast shipping!!!,"But it comes in a flat plastic see through case.I took the sticker off the back which says ""made in china"" :)It can be used individually to decorate and finish up a holiday present or the whole thing could be used as a nice casual x-mas gift.Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase.Just giving it a four star since I thought it would be in a box like the other 9.95 ornaments did.:)"
3,Listen to a band self-destruct,"It's clear that the attitude and style of the band's first album wasn't something the group wanted to maintain. Their later songs, particularly Australia, that are included on this disc are really not good. Certainly they bear no resemblance to the near-greatness of Ironmasters. I used to own the vinyl lp of Night of 1000 Candles but none of their newer stuff, so I got this Best Of set to get the lay of the land. I cannot recommend this set but 3 or 4 of the songs are good enough to raise my star-ratings out of the cellar. Instead, get Night of 1000 candles and if you like it (and you will), move forward in their catalog until you can't take it anymore."
5,Chicken Soup for the Horse Lovers Soul,This book does the line of Chicken Soup books great justice. A great read whether you love horses or not. The stories will touch everyone's hesrt.
5,"A ""must have"" book for horse lovers","This is just a great book, with stories that cover all areas of the horse world. I think any horseperson will find themselves, and a horse that they have loved, in at least one of the stories. I especially liked the remarkable courage and intelligence of ""Sgt. Reckless, a Mighty Marine"", the spiritual connection between horses and people in ""Instincts of a War Mare"", and the incredible accuracy (and humor) of ""Horse Lovers are Really Sick People""."
3,A must have for anyone who likes horses...,"As the husband of a woman addicted to all things equine I must say that I enjoyed this book. My experience with horses typically has to do with broom handling and staying out of the way and I enjoyed the stories of how horses actually enrich people's lives. While I thought horse were mostly good for spending money on I find that they are also good as healers, teachers, companions, and best friends. Like all the Chicken soup books the prose is simple and the stories are short and to the point. Do anyone who likes horses a favor and give them this book."
5,Chicken Soup for the Horse Lover's Soul,"I have loved horses ever since I was a little kid. I have many books about them, but none have touched me as much as this one. The title is no exaggeration; reading all of the stories in this book did my soul a world of good. I would recommend this book for any horse lover."
4,Soul therapy.,"You will enjoy reading this book simply because as a horse lover you will have experienced many or some of these emotions at some point. When something rings true and you can relate to it, it becomes personal.If you have loved and cared for any animal you will find the stories very 'real' and therefore moving.However, for someone totally unfimiliar to the horsey world it may be ever so slightly technical at times. But be adventerous, for you will get a peek at the magical world of horses!"
3,Chicken Soup For The Horse Lover's Soul,"I found this book a quick read; however, after awhile, there were too many smilarities in the stories. Some stories seemed to be used for tear jerker effect."
3,Good Book,"I like horses, but I had a hard time getting into this book. Some of the stories were better than others. I think two of my favorite stories were the one about the Horse at Harvard and the one about the horses surrounding and protecting the baby. Most of the stories were good. This is a book about true horse stories."
5,Inspirational Stories that Anyone Can Enjoy!,"When I first opened this book, what captured me first was how inspiration these stories are. Some stories are about faith and trust in your horse in hard times, some are miracles, some are sad yet very inspiring, some are about racehorse legends, and some are just about funny stories with horses. This book was very good, and what I loved was that the stories were pretty short and easy to read and follow along, so it's a little easier to read than a long novel. I usually bookmark the stories I haven't read yet, so I can always come back. All-in-all, this book can really get you hooked on horses and reading!!"
2,blaah,very basic very loose not my best purchase - not my definition of master -very good for a beginner-
1,Same old thing,"If you read her contribution to the ""Dynasties: The Connelleys"" series, you've pretty much read this one. I started to lose interest in the heroine before I was halfway through the book as she lacked motivation for many of her actions. What really did it for me, though, was the bedroom scene that seemed lifted straight out of her previous Dynasties book. Different setting, maybe, but it was otherwise exactly the same -- and I thought it completely unconvincing the first time around! Jeers here for the editor who let her get away with it. Had it not been for the fact this book was second in a twelve book series I would have tossed it in the furnace without finishing it. Thank heavens she isn't included in the new ""Dynasties: The Danforths"" series!"
5,Wonderful!,"This review is about ""The Legend of 1900""; I haven't watched the other movie with this set yet. ""The Legend of 1900"" is a lovely, memorable movie; someone called it a ""fable for adults"" and it does have elements of fable/fantasy about it, but it is very beautifully done. This film made me go looking for more work from Tim Roth as I was not familiar with him and thought he was mesmerizing in this movie. It is puzzling that this film didn't seem to have gotten as much attention as it should have, but I'm telling everyone about it now - long after its original release! The music is also wonderful - soaring and lush, jazzy, ragtime and foxtrot, walz and beautiful orchestration. Love the CD soundtrack, too! The song at the end sung by Rogers Waters is just so lovely and moving; Roger Waters of Pink Floyd wrote the lyrics and sings the only vocal piece in the film, at the very end. Wonderful. Great movie and great music and both stay with you long after viewing."
5,One of the finest stories ever told!,"I cannot recommend this movie more! I am so happy to know that their are such beautiful souls in the world, such as the writer of this tale.Thank you to the writer and director and the players!!This has a fabulous cast and incredible score."
2,Dull and boring,"I know this is a character study but when you don't care at all about any of the characters, it's still hard to like it. I sat through the whole thing and at the end, didn't feel I knew the characters any better than I did at the beginning and I could have cared less what happened to them."
5,Nice surprise!!!,"The Legend of 1900 was a wonderful, uplifting surprise. The music, the unique story and cinemetography blew me away. A different story set on a ship, and I was drawn in from early on.Take a chace on this one. It's not your everyday, here today, gone tomorrow movie!!!!"
2,Get ready to utilize the FAST FORWARD button on your remote,"I watched this movie with friends and almost immediately had to fast forward thru the opening titles as the female singers were so annoying. Our first surprise was that the film was less 'romantic comedy' as promoted than a meandering drama. The desert locale was tranquil and beautiful; Bridget Fonda and Eric Stoltz were well cast and interesting to watch; Phoebe Cates was appealing as the sane-but-boring ex-girlfriend; but even halfway into the storyline you never really cared about the characters or their situations. As my girlfriend pointed out, Tim Roth captures the homeless look perfectly (even his teeth which appear he has been chewing rocks) and she awarded him the title Most Unattractive Actor in a Film, EVER. Our advice, SKIP IT as there are other worthwhile films that feature the same talented actors."
2,Good and bad,"As dishwashers go, this one does a reasonable job washing dishes. Good points:--It's quiet--It has some useful adjustments on the racks if you want to fit in large dishesMine has had two bad points:--Within a few weeks of buying it, it would stop with an error code on the front. This would happen at various points in the cycle.--When I called customer server they really couldn't help much and, in cases were a bit gruff.For what it's worth, I asked the repairman who came what he thought of Frigidaire dishwashers. His comments weren't positive. When I mentioned that I had planned to buy a Whirlpool he said he thought that that might have been a better choice."
1,Leaks and steam damaged circuit boards - avoid Frigidaire,"I purchased an identical model (slightly different model number) in July 2008. In November 2008 the unit leaked and it took until December 22nd for them to replace a faulty gasket (Frigidaire knew the gasket was designed faulty).In May 2009, the dishwasher stopped working because steam had reached the main control circuitboard. I realized that this was a design flaw that affects many Frigidaire models and blogged about it. [...]The photo shows the inadequate venting in the side of the unit that led to the circuitry's demise.Avoid Frigidaire. There are so many other good brands you can go with."
1,Worst Dishwasher Ever,This dishwasher didn't work well from day 1...dishes and glasses were never fully cleaned...stay away from Frigidaire products.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"Shortly after I purchased this brand there was a piece on our local television station called ""Don't waste your money"" and it featured my new dishwasher. They were so right. It never cleaned the dishes and I am replacing it after less than five years. I will never purchase another Frigidaire appliance of ANY kind."
1,The door is incredibly loud - the spinning top piece broke off.,"About two years ago I purchsed all new appliances (new home). Everything has worked as expected... the washer and dryer are fine, the fridge, the microwave. Well, the Frigidaire Stainless Steeldishwasher has been poor to say the least. After about 2 months we noticed the spring to the door was getting louder... we didn't think much of it. About a year after having it, a plastic 'wing' (the only way I can think to describe it) was found on the bottom... it attached somewhere to the top rack but I couldn't figure out where at all.Now, two years later the spring is absolutely terrible. I advise buying any other dishwasher: avoid the Frigidaire Mfr. model #PLMV169DC."
5,Love it!,"My hubby and I bought this dishwasher (as part of the whole Frigidare Pro-Series set) in '08 when we did a major kitchen remodel. I have loved it since the moment we received it and have not had a single problem with it --so have been surprised by the low ratings! The appliance is beautiful and works great. It was even easy to install --we did it ourselves. My favorite feature is the hidden buttons. Keeps the appliance looking sleek and my curious toddler can't find the buttons to play with them. I also love the different wash/dry levels. It's a fairly good size, too, and with the adjustable top rack, can fit some fairly large dishes on the bottom rack."
5,"""Beat Generation"" worthy addition to any Beat collection","McDarrah's photograpic work evokes what it must have been like to frequent the bohemian scene of the late '50s and early '60's. Anyone who is greatly interested in the literature of this genre, but too young to have actual remembrances of this era, will find this work fascinating. Many of the photos have never been published before, and thus are a refreshing change from the standard photos of Kerouac, Ginsberg, and crew that have been served up so many times elsewhere. McDarrah, who I believe worked for the Village Voice at that time, has done a fine job in selecting the photos in this collection. My favorites are one of Diane DiPrima, perched on a piano reciting her poetry, and Herbert Huncke visiting Allen Ginsberg and attempting to fix the latter's broken TV. I also enjoyed the many pics of other accomplished, but lesser known figures of the era, and the establishments they frequented, such as the Cedars Bar &amp; Grill"
5,Island of the Saints,This was a very moving book. Having been a preteen during the second world war made this book even more interesting. I could not beleive what went on and the people of the U.S. had no idea.
2,I just don't get it. Such good actors in such a poor show.,"The poorly written,weak story line, and lack of direction left me with a strong feeling that I truly wasted my time watching this movie. Good actors with poor acting didn't help either. I think that the director must have been out of town that week."
3,Clint Walker speaks!,"Telly Savalas and Clint Walker are together again, in this fanciful version of Pancho Villa. Mr. Walker gives a very verbose, and masculine performance."
5,Finally!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Yeah, it's about time things make it to cd in hopes of better quality. Well, yes, it's better quality than the tape I had of the live show from vinyl. I never knew it was gonna come out, but 10 years after I'd first heard it, it's here and I bought it! The LP didn't have all of the live tracks! This cd has 37 songs. Pretty cool! They did very good versions of 60's covers. They are a very tight band for a band who did garage covers in the 70's. That was kinda unheard of, but these guys did them and they did them well. Another great band from the Minnesota area!"
5,Great i guees,"really i didnt feel a difference between this filter and the stock one. they importante thing is with this i diont have to buy any other filter ever and is really easy to clean, the problem is to take it out of the vstrom."
4,"Nazi purists may disagree, but...","...this TV movie isn't as bad as some reviewers claim. At moments it gets quite interesting and it features a once-in-a-lifetime-never-to-be-seen-again cast that includes John Gielgud, Trevor Howard, Ian Holm, Elke Sommer, Blythe Danner, Robert Vaughn, Rugter Hauer (Albert Speer) and the great Derek Jacobi as Hitler.Tends to be somehow an apology for Speer (couldn't be otherwise, it's based on his memoirs) and, true, it fails to inspire much emotion (except for the rage of a few reviewers, it seems). It's also rather long (a miniseries, actually) and may not be as accurate as some would like it to be. Personally ...who cares? If you're that obsessed with facts and dates read the book instead!So, not a life-changing movie experience for sure (I hope), but interesting if you're into WWII within reason."
4,A very Interesting movie on Albert Speer's life.,"This IS one of the Better movies that I have seen and own. It flows along well WITHOUT any violence or disgusting acts. The story line is well laid out, color IS Fine, and the music is good too. I've watched it many times and enjoy it."
5,Review of Inside the Third Reich,"This film has a very comprehensive view of the role of Albert Speer in the course of WWII. It gives the viewer a good sight of the development of Nazi Germany. What I really liked about this movie is that it gives a glimpsy of the real personality of the top Nazi leaders: Goring, Dr. Gobbels, Himmler, Hess, Borman and, of course, Adolf Hitler. It also describes the rivaries amongst them. This is not taught in the history books"
2,I WORKED IN THIS MOVIE WITH MARVIN CHOMSKY.MUNCHEN 1981.,"It might not be the best of Hollywood when it comes to WWII, but the historical facts are there, as always with Marvin Chomsky.It was fun to work with Derek Jacobi and Robert Vaughn, a delighful man, in Munich over Winter 1981-1982.Pascal Hakim."
1,Racist themes offend,"A. Edwin Wilson preached the ""Word of the Kingdom,"" arguing that unfaithful Christians will be excluded from the presence of God in the millennial rule of Christ. He also preached segregation. ""What God has separated, let not man integrate!"" -- chapter 15. I suppose you could argue Wilson was simply a man of his times (he pastored in the South), but the book was published in 1981! Wilson died in 1987. Neither the author, the publisher, nor the editor of the book bothers to explain why such rhetoric is relevant in post-Jim-Crow America.The book remains unchanged in subsequent printings.As an artifact of a bygone era, I guess the book is worth owning. No doubt we should preserve history. But I found the book's themes disgusting. It's very sad to see a man leave that sort of legacy. (Ironically, the book was published to honor the man!)"
4,"Fabulous Pens, not crazy about the colors.","Most of you who read my title are probably asking, ""Then why did you buy them if you didn't like the colors?"" I thought I would like the colors, however they really show up on paper very pastel strong. The Pen's themselves our fantastic, they write very well. They're the type of pens that make you want to write more.-Tanner"
3,One for the collection.,"JOSH FREESE is crazy. He is also on of the coolest people working in alternative music these days. THE NOTORIOUS ONE MAN ORGY is a fun record full of punk rock beats and poppy harmonies that never once takes itself seriously. FREESE deserves to goof around after doing some sweet drumming for the likes of cool bands like A PERFECT CIRCLE, ABANDONED POOLS and a host of others in the rock community, and he does so in a refreshingly silly way creating a CD thats great for parties and long car rides. Add this one to your collection for the fact alone that JOSH FREESE and this disc is cool and original."
2,Huge diference in size between bottom and top,"I bought this suit for a sprint triathlon, but the bottom was so small and the rise so short, there was no way I could wear it. I ended up getting a Tyr 2-piece that was much better"
5,It's Christmas Magic all Over Again!,"Every time I play this album during the busy holiday season, I am taken back 20 years. As a little girl lying on my parent's green sofa with the night sky darkening, I would listen to this album and think about Christmas and all of its meaning wrapped up into child-like dreams. The bouncing Christmas lights on the tree seemed to dance along with the music. ""Mary, Mary"", is one of my favoite songs. Harry Belefonte's voice just booms with feeling! What a fabulous trip down memory lane this album provides me every Christmas. I hope that it one day does that for my boys too."
5,"""Missa"" is magical","Separately, the musical elements of ""Missa"" are brilliant, well-polished jewels. Combined, the elements fit together in a big and wonderful way. Magic happens. Every time I listen to ""Missa,"" I love it even more. It stays eternally wonderful, as if it springs from a bottomless well of peace and inspiration. It makes me feel peaceful and inspired, too. It's just beautiful. Happy listening. -- from Renee"
1,don't buy this video,"The quality is horrible, music does not match the story at all, film is severely shortened. Don't spend money on this, find a different version."
5,Scots Master Fiddler,"James Scott Skinner was the finest Scots fiddler to record in the early 20th century. He also holds the distinction of being one of the oldest folk fiddlers to record, being born in the 1840s along with the American Southern fiddlers Henry Gilliland and Mose Bonner. Theirs is the oldest of fiddle styles to have been recorded and demand the attention of anyone interested in folk fiddling.Skinner recorded fairly extensively and this disc is a nice collection of his pieces (though not his complete recordings). His style is rooted in folk traditions, yet shows some classical influence. His taste in tunes is fantastic, his control and technique flawless. The sound quality is excellent for recordings of this age.A CD that belongs in every fiddle collection and one that should attract the attention of both folk and country fiddle enthusiasts."
3,"Sequel to ""The Commitments"", ""Snapper"" falls short...","""The Snapper"" is the second part of the Trilogy of a group of impoverished North Dubliners, the first part being the excellent and almost perfect movie, ""The Commitments."" ""The Snapper"" falls short of the quality of the first movie in part because the plot line is muddled. Characters portrayed in ""The Commitments"" reappear in ""The Snapper"" but are played weakly by different actors. The dilemma of the sister being pregnant out of wedlock is not really funny, nor is it a large enough crisis on which to build a movie. The single exception to the mediocrity is, as ever, Colm Meaney, once again brilliant, funny and poignant as the father of the family. He paces the film with his performance, laced with perfect comic timing and a delivery as good as any you'll see in any movie anywhere. See ""The Snapper"" for Meaney's performance--he won't disappoint you."
3,Interesting but Dated,"If you are a fan of British soap operas (e.g. EastEnders, Coronation Street), this will appeal to you. ""The Snapper"" takes place in Dublin, Ireland and chronicles life within a working class Irish family when the eldest unwed daughter gets pregnant.The title refers to the nickname they give the unborn baby. It is a realistic view of how a small community ostracizes one of its own for violating their mores, especially when they believe the baby's father is a respected member of the community. It is also a heart-warming study of how a family bands together to protect their daughter from outrageous treatment and slurs.This movie was released in 1993 and there have been so many other films dealing with teenage pregnancies since, including the recent award-winning Juno. It has a dated feel, like a period piece that does not quite jibe with society today. Still, it is worth watching."
2,Lame,"I'm wondering if people see this film as a mockery (even a self-mockery) of the Irish? Expect all the usual stereotypes and lame jokes. I guess what I found so disheartening is the constant drunkeness of the pregnant girl. I'd hate to think young women might think this is a healthy thing to do for their unborn child. As for the film itself, Colm Meaney was good as the caring father, the rest of the cast were flat and two-dimensional. I rented it for a dollar. It was worth all of that."
2,This is a comedy?!?,"Personally, I thought this movie was dark and depressing. It is the story of a 20-year old Irish woman who, after a night of drinking, is ""taken advantage of"" by a man so inappropriate, she's ashamed to admit that he's the father of her baby-to-be.Tina Kellegher's performance was very good, but could have been better if they'd given her character a little bit of depth. She comes off as very irresponsible and shallow, and she doesn't seem to learn from her mistakes. I agree with the other reviewer who wrote that Colm Meaney provided an excellent portrayal of a concerned and good-hearted father, but the rest of the cast was practically non-existent - especially the young woman's mother, who shows very little concern or interest in the pregnancy whatsoever (mainly because her character is so underdeveloped in the movie).For a TV movie, this is very watchable. For a DVD, it's a waste of money. If you're looking for a laugh, look somewhere else."
3,"Good movie, but lacks insight.","The movie is trying to make a comedy out of girl's pregnancy by exploiting all the old tricks, remaining superficial and extorting cheap laughs all the way to the end. One might derive a great enjoyment out of it, especially if you are drunk and irish, otherwise it is just a silly little story which will comfort you to bed on a lonely night."
5,Wickedly funny,"Based on the second book in Roddy Doyle's Dublin trilogy, The Snapper is a wickedly funny glimpse into the lives of a working class Irish family. The eldest daughter of a large family becomes pregnant and refuses to name the father. Not your traditional comic premise, but in this case it works beautifully. The characters are fully developed and presented in such a manner that you care deeply about them, and experience their pain as well as their joy. Veteran actor Colm Meaney (Star Trek DS9), who appears in the other two films that make up the trilogy (The Commitments and The Van), masterfully carries the story as the father of the unruly brood. He comes across as a good man who tries to do the right thing and loves his family, but is painfully human at every turn. The rest of the cast is mostly unknown but very believable and capable. I highly recommend this film (and the books, too). It may be the closest you ever get to Dublin without actually crossing the Atlantic."
5,A Classic,"i absolutly love this movie and I looked for the longest time to find it! I found it on Amazon, and first I didnt think it was going to be the original, its a classic, depicts a dysfunctional family in Inner City Dublin in the late 80's. A MUST SEE........."
2,Poor copy!,I was dissappointed in the poor grainy quality of this DVD. It even froze at one point in the movie. Very unsatisfied considering the money I spent for it.
3,Good craic,"This is a hugely entertaining film, filled with brilliant Dublin humour. However - and I could be mistaken - I think that it has been cut in parts? I first saw this many years ago and distinctly remember a few scenes and phrases that appear to have vanished. I wonder why? A good laugh anyway."
5,Sweet Suspense,The suspense continues to the end. The suspense created throughout by Fatima Kazim kept me reading on and on. And for the first time in a long time I read a book in just two days. I enjoyed reading it so much that I wanted to share this with my sister. I immediately asked for a copy for her.
5,Good Read,Very helpful in understanding concepts. Provides no examples though (not a workbook). Useful as an ehancer to a textbook by explaining dificult concepts in down to Earth terms. I would recommend for the price.
3,too many misunderstandings,"The title of this book shouldn't be how to ace calculus. It should be something like:"" Before going to class I'd like to see the big picture."" The book is an excellent tool but it should be considered as a warm up before going to class and nothing more."
4,How to Ace Calculus: The Streetwise Guide,"Very well written, simple explanations of all topics, enjoyed reading the book. I deducted a star because of the lack of practice problems and I also didn't like the part on the Substitution Method of integration."
4,Way to go!,"This book really makes me want to learn Calculus 2.After reading it, I find myself going back to my Calculus textbook for a deeper understanding. The explanations are very clear, humorous and to the point. I even ordered their ""How to ace the rest of Calculus"". I like the way they explain the derivative as being the slope of the tangent line. I enjoyed that book and I recommend it to anyone who may still hesitate to take a Calculus class.. Bravo!"
5,Teacher recommends,"I teach Calculus at the high school level and was very impressed with this book. I recommend it for my students as a supplement. It explains the concepts in ""real words"" and helps some of them understand. Also, additional examples that are well explained."
1,Who Would Find This Helpful?,I expected some clearly worded explanations of the topics I faced in my gigantic calculus course book. This book has some brief explanations of the major topics but they're not any better than what's in my text book. This doesn't add anything to my understanding of calculus. Perhaps Calculus for Dummies or the Complete Idiot's Guide would have been better choices. I was also dissapointed with Calculus Made Easy. It wasn't any easier than my text book either. My money would have been better spent on a tutor. Michael Kelly's Humongous Book of Calculus problems is very good for showing how to work through some tough problems.
2,Not what its cracked up to be,"I got this book thinking it would be perfect for my college calculus classes, what a mistake that was. I used Stewart's text, which is a pretty common text, and this book didn't cover even half the material we went over. The material it did cover it didn't go nearly in depth enough to actually learn anything. If you want to read a book to become familiar with calculus before you get a real book this might be ok, but it really covered so much less material than Stewart and didn't really do any better of a job for the most part at explaining it that I don't see any reason to buy this book. Perhaps for high school calculus this may be better but for college calculus it truly is completely useless I feel. For each concept there are only a few worked out problems and those are so basic they aren't even worth being mentioned for the most part. Do yourself a favor and if you are using a halfway decent textbook don't worry about buying this."
3,my second review,"Alternative book: 0764563769I am a crammer , I hate studying , I almost never study until just before an exam , I depend on good,clear,short,very organized,comprehensive, pre-digested notes with step-by-step solved problems for every possible case , I spend the entire semester collecting such rare and valuable notes. the problem with these made-easy books like this one and shaum's is that they ommit material and thus make the subject shorter and seemingly easier but it is quality not quantity that counts , I bought this book because my text was crowded with pages completly filled with words and useless details (0471153060) , texts are refrences. but this book made the aformentiond mistake. I don't like to go through too much jokes before getting the info i need to know how to solve problems."
3,nice but defecient,"the good: has an easy to understand approach to explaining calculus concepts if you got the time and patience. summary at back is excellent.the bad: more appropriate for high schoolers because this book lacks alot of college level math info , i.e. lots of ommited calculus concepts like newton's method and others. unfortunately the jokes are excessive and waste time , especially if you got an important exam looming. maybe the authors were having a party.how to improve the book: if they had lessend the jokes and expanded on the summary and included in it lots of examples and the ommited material then this book would be by far the best seller in the universe.and the strange: Question: in the range of pages from [1 to 227] in this book, find the formal definition of a limit. WRONG Ans: well since its a calc book its gotta be there somewhere. CORRECT Ans: in the range [1 , 227] the formal def of a lim does not exist in this book ,try this book instead: 0764563769."
2,Not the quality of calculus study aid I had expected...,"...given the mostly glowing reviews. Don't expect miracles from this guide. Nothing particularly enlightening in its contents, if you had stayed awake during classes...."
3,Easy Learning,I ordered this book after having it recommended by my professor. It has offered a more informal way of learning calculus and has really helped during my homework.
5,Excellent Book,"If you are taking calculus without this book, you are wasting too much time. This book is destined to be a classic. If you enjoy being confused and want bad grades, this book is not for you."
1,Extremely Triggering,"As an adult who is new to recovery, this book made me angry. It's written in the third person with no emotion, none of the angst that goes with an eating disorder. Yes, it is a quick read, but after finishing it I wanted to throw it across the room. I still don't know why or how she recovered, unless it was by getting the perfect job. This book should not be read by anyone with or recovering from an eating disorder. There should be disclaimer on the cover saying ""numbers, height and weights inside."""
5,Insightful,This book took me back to my childhood. I was surprised at how much I had in common with the author. I appreciate Leanne Brogans honesty and openness and wish her wellness and continued strength on the journey.
1,should be a dog's toy,"This ""massager"" is a joke. I bought it as a traveling massager. It is very squishy and does nothing but tickle your feet. I could not even feel it under my neck. I gave it to my dog and even he didn't like it. If you want serious myofacial release-style massagers, get a quality foam roller and a lacrosse ball. Don't waste your money here."
2,Massage Peanut,Not as hard as I would have liked and pretty soft so even when lying on top of it it doesn't get the pressure to the muscles as I would have liked.For those that sturggle with too much applied pressure and not those that train hard or consistently.
1,contains phthalates,"Comes with a Huge Warning sticker that says it contains one or more phthalates. Phthalates are known to cause birth defects and harm reproductive organs -- would have been nice if they mentioned that in the product description.Also, the spines are really pokey and hurt!"
3,Spikes a little too sharp,May not be for everyone since the spikes are sharp enough to hurt when too much pressure is applied. It does effectively work out muscle tension if pressure adjust accordingly.
2,To lame,"Item is to soft to really work well, compress to easily.Don't really use it, still use my tennis ball"
2,Foot massage peanut,"Even with socks on, the Foot Massage Peanut plastic is too rigid & the spikes are too hard. I have much tougher feet than my husband & even I don't like it. Sorry! It doesn't work for our needs."
3,Made is Hazardous materials?,If your pregnant or nursing you should not use. That was the sticker that was on the packaging if I would have know that I would have gotten the wooded one instead if this plastic one.
2,Windows NT book rehash,"This is a rehash of a Windows NT book for the most part, with a LITTLE veneer of Win2000 features tacked on. He has a whole chapter on the dorky PAINT program, but only a few pages on TCP/IP setup features and doesn't include the advanced features.This could have been a good 200 page book with a bit more thoughtful selection of material. As published, it's a mediocre 1100 page boilerplate job."
3,W2K Pro for the Newbie,"I was disappointed in this book. The majority of the almost 1000 pages are written for people just stumbling in from the backwoods who've never seen a computer. There are a few tidbits of detail to be gleaned by the experienced user, but more often than not the book spends too many words explaining operations or features that even the most casual user of any Windows OS already knows.I had hoped for a book that took me deep into the W2K Pro OS, but this one barely let me beneath the surface. A far better book for the experienced is the Windows 2000 Administrators Pocket Consultant, which I purchased at the same time as this one. The Pocket Consultant is getting all the thumb marks."
2,Not recommended for the advanced technical user,"I was disapointed with the book. It might be useful for a novice user, but it doesn't get into the detail which I was expecting. I have been pleased with other Sybex books in the past, but this one probably won't make it on my reference shelf. If you are an advanced user searching for a rather technical book, I would not recommend this book."
2,Not as good as expected,"This book did not cover the important new features of Windows 2000 Professional. Four chapters were wasted on HTML and VBScripting. The examples were poor and often hard to follow or actually incorrect. Not enough time was spent on how to configure 2000 Professional. There are many great new features and this book does not do a good job of explaining and showing you how to configure them. Mark, how about spending a chapter on helping us configure IIS before spending 4 chapters on writting VB scripts."
3,Mastering...I dont think so....,"It's a great book for beginners to intermediate Windows 2000 Administrators.If you are at a senior Level, this book is not for you. How to setup network printers, understanding network cabling and setting up a modem, its far from Mastering Windows 2000."
4,"Well written and thorough ""how to""","My library consists on a number of reference books and I would not be without books written by Mark Minasi. I am 2 elective exams away from MCSE and would regularly reference his book when needing to know how to do something. This is not a sole source book if your goal is MCSE certification, but is is an extremely thorough and easy to follow ""how to"" if your goal is to learn how to use this operating system."
5,Total jam. One of the top five albums of all time.,"This is by far one of the best cd's i have ever purchased, good party music, and fly samples. If you can find it on vinyl, buy it, its one of the best discs i have ever spun with..."
1,Conceiving nothing!,"I am a true Ada Lovelace fan, I have books about her, books about Babbage, and her picture in my office, but this film is not about Ada. From the first moment the dialog began I cringed inside and any sliver of hope I had (even at this point), I knew was extremely wishful. The script was dreadful, it was reminiscent of someone you meet who upon trying to impress you, tries too hard, is a name dropper and talks incessantly about subjects you are informed of in a way that is immature and simply uncomfortable. If you are someone who understands the historical importance of Ada, this plot will be nothing but torture to you, and feel strikingly sacrilegious. This movie is not intelligent, but rather, it is insulting, has it's own agenda, takes credit for ideas that have been established by others, marries multiple plots into an annoying and badly acted overkill and is mostly disrespectful, as Ada's name has been used and defamed."
3,Good Film...where are the others?,"The Seventh Seal is certainly one of Bergman's better films, if not his most popular. How soon will Svenska Filmindustri release the rest on DVD?"
4,The Seventh Seal (Criterion Collection) - Blu-ray Info,"Version: U.S.A / Criterion / Region AAspect Ratio: 1.33:1MPEG-4 AVC BD-50 / AACSRunning time: 1:37:38Movie size: 28,593,420,288 bytesDisc size: 48,704,359,454 bytesTotal bit rate: 39.04 MbpsAverage video bit rate: 34.49 MbpsLPCM Audio Swedish 1152 kbps 1.0 / 48 kHz / 1152 kbps / 24-bitDolby Digital Audio English 192 kbps 1.0 / 48 kHz / 192 kbpsDolby Digital Audio English 192 kbps 1.0 / 48 kHz / 192 kbpsSubtitles: English SDHNumber of chapters: 15#Audio Commentary#Ingmar Bergman Introduction (HD - 3 minutes)#Bergman Island (HD - 84 minutes)#Afterword (HD - 11 minutes)#Max von Sydow Audio Interview#Woody Allen on Bergman (HD - 8 minutes)#Bergman 101 (HD - 36 minutes)#Trailer - (HD - 3 minutes)#26-page booklet"
5,A question,"Obviously one of the GREAT movies, but this is just a question, not a review:Is the 1.33:1 full screen of this DVD the original one? I'd love to hear from you if you know. Many thanks."
4,an excellent film.,"This review is for the criterion collection edition.This film is probably the most famous Swedish film to be released in the US. It helped launch Ingmar Bergman's career in the US and launched Max Von Sydow to international stardom.In this film, a soldier coming home from the crusades is approached by Death and challenges him to a game of chess. The film is set against a time when the bubonic plague was raviging Europe.It has great cinematography and the acting is also quite well done. This film is a masterpiece and sure to remain a classic.The criterion edition includes some great bonus features including clips of some of Bergman's other films and an audio commentary of the film. It also has an English dubbed soundtrack."
2,Unbelievably overrated,"Frankly I didn't like it. I didn't learn anything from it either. The biggest impression it left me with was just how ignorant people are. You have the idiot flagellants whipping each other and acting like obnoxious fools. History tells us that the idiot flagellants were a murderous band, sweeping through towns and killing every Jew they could find. You have another band of idiots burning a woman as a witch. You have all sorts of idiots. Perhaps the only valuable lesson in this movie, unintended, is just how deluded the religious maniacs are. Don't touch those stem cells!"
1,Torturous 90 Minutes,"The most atheistic, nihilistic, depressing movie I have ever seen. Death is preferred over life in this movie. Love is called ""the blackest of all plagues"". The message of this movie is that life is meaningless and that ideals are ridiculous and absurd. I was hoping for a moral at the end of the story, but sadly, this movie is just gloomy nihilism with attractive actors. Western Civilization is pining away in a morass of depressed meaningless bc of too many movies like this."
5,Nearly the best film ever made,"Being a representetive of Generation Y, the 12-20 year olds living in the aftermath of Generatin X, I can say that this film is excellent. The writing is just flawless. It flows. None of the actors struggle over forced lines, the direction is beautiful, and it really is a thinking person's film. Some people foolishly praise it for its reputation, I praise it for its content. I urge you to see this film at least eight times."
5,Top of the line!,"The plot is simple, the special effects are nil, and it's in black and white. This movie demonstrates the difference between art and artifice, and between essentiality and superficiality. The DVD is also 5-star quality, with excellent rendition, and wonderful commentary. The dubbed version is better than the subtitled one."
5,Criterion does a great job with this bluray,"I own the dvd version that Criterion put out and it looks great but after buying a bigger tv with higher resolution I wanted the bluray of this film to add to my collection. This has to be in the top 5 of my favorite films, as you watch it you forget that you are reading subtitles and watching a black and white movie from the 50's. If you like dark, you'll love this movie. I lucked out because i bought it used and the case was in great condition and it was shipped out quickly. If you haven't seen it, buy the criterion dvd first (because it's a great transfer that even boasts 'high definition') or stream it (its also on TCM once in awhile) and if you love it, upgrade it to blu ray."
5,A must buy for all blu ray and movie fans,"Criterion collection deals in mostly older movies from around the world, criterion has some of the best movies you'll ever see,take a look at their catalog.. this is a great hi def transfer of a great movie. A must buy without a doubt. Classic movies like this is the reason why i bought a blu ray player."
3,TRANSLATION ALERT!,"Earlier versions of this video included much truer translation of the Swedish dialogue. For some reason, for example, this translation chooses to change the names of Jof and Mia to ""Joseph and Mary,"" imposing some oddball Christian connection that makes very little sense in the context of the film. Also, there are entire passages that don't get translated at all. Maybe the ""improved English translation"" on the DVD release restores the straighter interpretation of the script. In the meantime, if you want to see the more accurate translation in the subtitles, try auctions for the earlier release."
1,yawn!,"If you have trouble sleeping at night in bed, see this movie! Man it is boring! The only thing that Bergman seems to say is that chess is boring! I hate chess! And black and white movies are and have always been dumb. If you wanna see a GOOD movie (with no chess!) see Raw Deal with Arnold Schwaerensegger. Nobody gives him a raw deal! Not even an ugly bald guy in a black robe!"
1,This is the most boring movie I've ever seen!,I first heard of this movie when watching Last Action Hero. I decided it looked interesting. But when I finally rented it I found out that it's not even in English. Not one person in the movie speaks english. There's English Subtitles. Also it was really long and boring.It was the most boring movie I've ever seen in my life. I have a couson who thinks this movie is interesting and good. He must be crazy to think it's good. Do not rent or buy this it's completly boring and not in the language of English.
1,"The Seventh SUCK--a review by Jack ""MOOSE"" Hoffman","Haha, the make-up for the grim reaper is so bad. He's litteraly just a bald guy in a bath robe, like, oooh I'm so scared. And why are they all speaking German? Did they not make enough money paying accordion on street corners or whatever to do American voice-overs...?Also if that's not enough to make you avoid this movie, their's a bunch of scenes with a naked little boy. Lol, what a movie for pedos.They should remake this movie with good special affects and if they spoke English. Until then it feels like a pretty bad ripoff of Avatar."
4,A must have,Every parent should get this must-have item if they want to challenge their children's knowledge and association. My children have gained so much from this game...I see them making more and more association of things a daily basis.
2,Horrible layout of the very basics,"I ordered this book from Amazon because I had heard so much good stuff about it. I just finished packing it up to send it back. After flipping through it, I was amazed at how basic this book is. No treatment, or diff. dx, or anything after the topics. The book honestly FEELS AND LOOKS LIKE IT WAS PRINTED ON A PHOTO COPIER, not a press! Horrible layout and quality (esp. the pictures). This book is only worth your time, if nothing else is available."
3,Good outline/material. Too many errors,"While I agree with many posters that this book has just high-yield info and for that it should be applauded, it has way too many errors for my taste. I bought it based on many reviews that I have read, but I am on page 8 and have found an error or misleading oversimplification on every page thus far. For example on page 8 the author states that disulfiram inhibits alcohol dehydrogenase (it inhibits aldehyde dehydrogenase, the second enzyme in the metabolism of alcohol - which is important because aldehyde is what makes you sick). On page 7 the author implies that smoking is the biggest controllable risk factor to prevent heart-disease related deaths. Though I don't have a specific fact to refute that claim, it is likely that diabetes is a greater variable. Don't get me wrong, I like the book. However, the errors are incredibly distracting."
1,Useless,This book was useless for step 2. Most of the information written in this book weren't on the exam. I don't know how this book got its reputation.
2,Well presented chapter but ......,"If you are looking to add further information to this book ( as is needed from other sources ) the fact that the contents are not in alphabetical order might waste allot of time flipping back and forth and on every occassion having to look to the content table. Unlike First Aid, where the contents are in alphbetical order ( ex: Cardiovascular, Dermatology, Endocrine .... etc.). If it was alphabetical it would allow for faster and more efficient stydying as is needed in preperation of a Step exam. Best of luck."
4,Good review for Step 2CK,"Not a bad review for Step2CK. By this point in your med school career, you should be pretty familiar with all the material just from being on the wards daily. This book gives you a good overall review of most of the subject matter that will appear on Step2CK, including some areas that you may have not had much (or any) exposure to, such as ophtho, ortho, ENT...This book is NOT comprehensive, however, so if you're especially weak in the clinical sciences, you may want to look elsewhere for a more extensive review.Also, consider supplementing your study time with a question bank. USMLEWorld.com is a good resource and not too expensive."
3,WORTH READING,"ICED takes place in Missoula Montana, where Meg Gardner an ex- con turned repo woman, is trying to get her life together. Meg has to repo a jeep belonging to Clay Bennett, the same Clay Bennett that was just found dead. Meg figures that it will be easy to get the jeep back, but once she has it back the trouble starts. Someone else wants the jeep, next thing you know Meg is drawn into a murder mystery involving sex and violence. As Meg tries to solve the mystery she must deal with her own ghosts from her past as well as deal with Russian thugs and Tina Red Dear, a Native American woman who could very well be her half sister. I thought that ICED was well written but left me with to many unanswered questions about Megs past. The mystery involving Clay Bennett was top-notch with plenty of suspense. Meg is a protagonist that really wants to be left alone to live her life low- key with coffee, cigarettes, beer, and burgers in that order."
3,Disappointing follow up to Easy Money,"Jenny Siler is a lyrical writer and her first book Easy Money was an intriguing blend of tough/bad girl protagonist with beautiful writing coupled with an intriguing plot.This second novel, Iced, is not nearly as strong. Another heroine who has taken a few too many walks on the wild side, but the plot elements don't tie together. The supporting characters aren't adequately developed and the ""bad guys"" don't give you the appropriate goose bumps.It feels like this book was written in a hurry and not given enough time to rewrite and expand the story. This is a book that just doesn't have enough depth. If the writer had just digged a little deeper it could have been a much better book. As it is, wait until it comes out in paperback."
3,Having fun with music and animal sounds...,"This product is just as I expected it to be. My son seems to enjoy it. The animal noises are good except for the lion which is a man making the roar sound. The ""drum sticks"" come apart too easily. Overall, a good toy."
3,Extremely modern!,"Deep Silence was creative but a little too slow for the opening cut. I preferred ""Ocean"" as the best instrumental using Harp as the center instrument. At times the harp sounded like the guitar that it was difficult to tell. I would have liked to hear more classical celtic rhythmic tempos throughout. The Harp being what it is - a celestrial instrument - would have liked a little more of that type of notes used instead of it sounding like the traditional guitar. ""Maoi"" was interesting and this could be played as music for a gathering."
5,beautiful girl playing beautiful harp,"beautiful girl playing beautiful harp. peace,deep trance,flowing,meditation & medicimal in Moai. this must be most important CD in 2000. l'm looking forward to Monica's new works."
1,STINKS WORSE THAN ROTTEN EGGS!,"The Spice Girls are pitiful. They can't act, sing, play any instrument nor can they deliver lines. They are just a put together ensemble that passed an audition. They aren't even a real group. They stink! This interview is tired and pathetic. Nasty Spice, Rancid Spice, Rotten Spice, Stinky Spice and Stupid Spice belong down the drain. That is the place for old spices. Boo, Hiss!"
4,"clever, whimsical","I had never even heard of Stephan Leacock, but I read about his writings and wanted to read him for myself.Picture yourself in the office of The Great Detective:""At the same moment there was a slight scratching at the door. A visitor entered. He crawled stealthily on his hands and knees. A hearthrug thrown over his head and shoulders disguised his identity. He crawled to the middle of the room. Then he rose.Great Heavens! It was the Prime Minister of England.""You!"" said the detective.""Me,"" said the Prime Minister.I have truly found a kindred spirit, who makes me giggle and laugh out loud at his silly inventiveness. My only problem with this book is that it is really a brief series of short vignettes. I want MORE!"
3,Had higher hopes for this,"I thought this was going to be more transcendent, in terms of its enduring quality (it was advertised to me this way) but the satire here feels old and a little tired."
3,"It was alright, not great, not horrible","harry potter games are fun, but this one wasnt the greatest. i agree with some of you who said it started off too abrupt. the chamber of secrets atleast had some levels in diagon alley and at the burrow, but this one started off on the train. it was just kinda dissapointing. secondly, this was the first time you dont get to play quiddich. that sucks cuz quiddich is a hella fun part of the game. plus it gives everyone a break from the story plot, delivering a world to the player that is closer to reality. all in all, its a semi fun game, but now very challenging. my grade would be a C"
2,BIG Dissapointment,"OK. I am a HUGE Harry POtter freak. I am totally obsessed. I have all the books and have read them each at least 10 times. Even the fifth one. When I got this game, I thought it would be way cool, alas, I was mistaken. I don't really like this game very much, it's NOTHING compared to other games I've played. This game is long, tedious, and, well... boring. You spend most of your time at the stupid ""loading"" screen, and when you aren't there, you are doing some meaningless task that someone tells you to do. BORING. The battle system really stinks, I can never manage to hit anything with Harry's stupid wand. I say, forget the wand. FIND A SWORD. This dumb game doesn't do ANY justice to the greatness of the books.Sorry Harry dear, but this game is at the bottom of MY list."
1,disappointing,"I thought this game was like the other two. Fun and a little bit challenging. but i was wrong. Despite the great reviews, this game is nothing but a disapointment. No new features,no new locations, and for those of you who know all the characters, no trelawny ,no hogsmeade, No Boggarts. And you dojn't even get to fly buckbeak. it is just a cut-scene. The only new thing about the game is three new spells. Even thought you get to play as new characters, you can't choose which character to play as. This game is most probably aimed at children that do not understand what a good game is. Do not waste your money on this."
1,This game is a bad bad game.....and it sucks anyway,is definitly not the game to buy oyur childeren this coming holiday sesaon. and it just plain sucks
1,AAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!,"All I Have To say is that this game is terrible, it's not a good game to buy you child this holiday season, it is very graphic, take it from me, a child who asked for this gift for my Birthday, (It was the worst Birthday ever!) I tried it and it Sucked!"
3,Too short,"Harry Potter Game series are one of the games I'm looking forward to play and of course when PoA gam is out, I thought, what the heck, lets try it. And try I did.Graphics are the well satisfactory but I like to turn around and see my enviroment more than it can offer me. Storyline is well along the line of the book and I don't have to tell you about that, or I would spoil you from reading the books.The most let down of this game is that it is too damn short! It's shorter than what they have done to the movie itself, I don't have to tell you how many scenes they cut from that book *winks* There are only a few tasks and not much exploring in this one, as I would compare to the CoS game. It's much more fun playign the last game than this one. But it's quite awesome for kids though, but not for us hardcore fans."
2,Dont buy unless you want the free movie ticket.,Here's something to remember if you want to buy this game. The game could take less than 2 days to beat even if you've never seen a PS2 before. The game isn't near as exciting as the book and misses a lot of key parts. There is absouletly no quidditch in this game. I really enjoyed the other games because playing quidditch was so much fun. In this game you mainly watch cut-scences and spend half of your time finding spellbooks. Another great part of the book was the excitement of going to Hogsmeade for the first time. In this game you go to Hogsmeade once and it's not even scheduled. I give this game 2 stars because I think it could have been much better and more exciting. I would recommend renting this game instead of buying it unless if you want to play it over and over and seeing how many times you cant beat it in a year (probably 365).
2,ok game,Nice graphics. But My kids who are fans of The books wer'nt able to maintain intrest.I'm sure I will finish it but I bought it for my kids....So.... I was dissapointed in their lack of excitement.As a parent I would buy Shrek 2 instead. My children loved itand were instantly into it and maintained intrest.
4,Awesome and has the best graphics(Ever),Best graphics and let's you play as Hermione and Ron and Hermione has the best spells and Ron is the best passage finder. You can take control of hedwig when you have to help Harry.And when you Vs those dementors they will run away like fraidy cats. GO OUT THERE AND GET IT!!!!!!
4,More torture porn..,"This is not a genre that I appreciate and I didn't realize that it would be a torture porn film when I was terribly bored and rented it. That being said, I'm really impressed. The acting is quite good as is the dialogue. Watching how different personalities handle the situation is quite fascinating and, the music...wow. Most semi-low budget horror movies go for a death metal sound but, this one is more in the realm of folk music. The twist may have you contemplating psycology a bit at least, I certainly was. All around great presentation."
5,Maximum results from the MiniBrute,Lots of power packed in this portable devise makes this a handy tool for drilling or boring steel in the field or back at the shop. Durable unit construction and storage case makes transportation a breeze. Clear user instruction for operation of unit. Powerful magnet allows maximum clamping power and accurate results. Great tool that is made to stand up to heavy use and will last for years and years. Would buy again.
4,A Fascinating Artist.,"This painter, collage artist has so many twists and turns in his style that I wanted to see more works to better understand him."
4,You want Brutal? here ya go,"These guys rule,and I think this is their best record.The use of a drum machine creates inhuman mayhem and brutallity.The production here,unlike their future releases..is absolutely huge.Plus,how can you go wrong with songs like lives ruined through sex and two sh*ts to the moon? Probably the most under-rated aspect of these guys is that the songwriting is great,and that you don't tire of this record with repeated listening.This is exactly what grindcore should sound like.Pick up immiedietly if you want a beating"
5,Powerful mainline brutality!,Unlike many people i loved Honkey Redcution the first time i heard it.From the moment the cd begins spinning you are assualted by a wall of buzzing guitars and annihilating drum machine programming that reaches insanely fast tempos.The album is like a shot of energy into your arm;gets your blood racing and your adrenaline levels spinning out of control.Agoraphobic Nosebleed are all about sick humour and inhuman speed fueled madness.let your brain be caved in by Agoraphobic Nosebleed!
5,Insanity,"This CD is one of the best grindcore cds out there, and definitely the heaviest. If you like this cd, I suggest checking out Pig Destroyer, they are even heavier and faster."
4,decent buy,"So far so good, i bought it bcoz my original keyboard(OEM) had broken down. for the price it is on, it is a decent buy. the good thing about it is that you can configure many of the buttons, for ex., i changed the messenger to yahoo, etc. The cons are that it would have beeen great if they added a task manager button, as anyone who uses a computer knows-- you would definitely appreciate that button when programs hang.In conclusion this was a suprisingly good product from microsoft, compared to the reliability of their software."
1,faded in & out like 1930's AM radio from across the ocean!!!,"Imppossible to listen to!! There has to be a better way as listening on this connection is a sometime thing. And I know ""Before the Rain"" is beautiful music from years before on LP records."
5,this is the best cd of Lee Oskars i recommend it to eveyone,"I think ""Before The Rain"" cd by Lee Oskar is his best cd ever. I find this particular cd relaxing and very spiritual.The way he plays the harmonica to these songs is breathtaking.It brings back good memories of my mom because this was her favorite cd.So what better way than to remember a loved one through there favorite music."
2,Shotgun Approach,The selections do not appear to be in any logical order; neither by composer nor by type. They seem to have been just shuffled to fit on the discs.
1,OXO roll mop refill blue version is worthless,"I bought the rollermop, with it's original blue sponge- and one replacement sponge at the same time from bed bath beyond- the sponges LOOKED identical. The first sponge served well enough. Upon use of the replacement, I found it did not fit the mop - the rollers extended past the sponge on one side when squeezing dry, so it was continually slipping off the handle. Also, within about 30 uses on a fairly clean floor (no big challenges), using murphy's oil soap- no chemical challenges- the sponge simply tore off the metal bracket. I'm going to try to return the roller mop itself, as it has no value without replacement sponges. I'll go to a janitorial supply store for my next mop; I find consumer products have been 'value engineered' until all the value is GONE."
1,Poor quality refill,"The sponge refill is useless, I ordered the blue ones, and it came the yellow with blue strips. Poor quality, and leave my floor very wet."
3,An Existential Perspective,"I recently just finished rereading this novel (having first read it years ago).Now, I'm no intellectual (and I'm not about to embark on some critical theory bender), but when I first read this novel I thought of in in simple terms, and certainly found it interesting.I read it now, and realised it was first published in the mid 50s, smack in the middle of the high of Sartre's Existentialism. I couldn't help but think of it as a 'what if Existentialism become a world religion' scenario?That's all. Just another way to think about the book."
4,very good review and refresher.,"I've been writing java code on and off for years, but never studied it formally. I bought this book to flesh out my knowledge and fill in the spaces, which it did quite well. If you have time and inclination for a thousand page book like O'Reilly's ""Learning Java,"" great. If you want a quick refresher or intro - this book is perfect."
5,Amazing Book!!,"This book is phenomenal - I couldn't put it down! Jason Dorsey's message is clear, compelling, and inspirational. His book is an easy-read that I will recommend to all of my 20-something friends. Real-world success stories are interwoven with uplifting principles that connect with the reader at a very deep level. It left me feeling energized and motivated, and I have already put the ideas to good use. I have no doubt that this book will make a profoundly positive impact in many people's lives."
3,a real nice collection of Latin Jazz,"I picked this up at Virgin for $10; had I gotten it at Amazon for half that I would've given it 5/5. As such, at 13 songs, though some are long, it's just not enough. Why only 63mins? I am sure they could've filled up the CD. However, this sounds like something made for the American audience, just as the numerous ""Gypsy"", ""New Gypsy"" collections are. I am not sure this is real pure Latin music as is played there.The same artists, mostly 5, appear on all other CoLJ: albums. Thus, you are better off getting their albums instead of these collections."
2,Broken in 4 months,"I actually liked this mop. I didn't think it was too heavy or had any problems with the mop head like the previous reviewer. However, the part in the middle of the mop that you lift up on to squeeze out the water from the mop head broke within 4 months of use (and this was infrequent use at that). We fixed it ourselves, but do not know how long our fix will hold up. I am very disappointed in this OXO product."
1,Mop head falls off all the time.,"I am a great fan of OXO products, but this one's a bummer. It doesn't squeeze the water out well so your floors are left more wet than they should be. But the real problem is the mop head. Despite being secured properly, it falls of easily and regularly. I've just given up at this point...it fell of 5 different times while mopping my small kitchen. It's too frustrating and wastes too much time to keep having to slide the mop head back in. I expect more from OXO, especially since my cheapie mop had no issues with the mop head falling off."
1,Avoid,"This mop is a big pain. It is too heavy, you can't squeeze out enough water, and the mop head falls off easily."
3,"Picks up dirt, but unravels easily","I purchased this mop because I had previously bought 10 mopheads from Linens and Things for 90% off. I didn't think to buy the mop at the time. Initially it picks up very well, but the strings on the roller come off fairly quickly. I abuse my mops (100% saltillo tile) and these have held up well. The down side is that if you move the mop from side to side instead of front to back it comes off the roller. It's easy to put back on (more so than other mops), but it's messy."
2,The head comes off.,"Ever want to sweep sideways to deal with the utterly rare situation in which a wall meets a floor? No dice for this sucker. Then good luck getting the head back on. You will feel like a surgeon trying to operate on yourself. Place that lever thing just right, as you hold it!!! Then it falls off again."
1,One and Done,Worked well the one time it worked. Broken I guess. Mop head won't stay on. Can't return it because I bought it in another city. Why can't they design mops that don't break? I have been through so many mops and they all break. It's not rocket science. I am completely flabbergasted with the mop industry.
1,Absolutely terrible,"The head keeps falling off, the sponge doesn't stay in place which makes it close to impossible to squeeze most of the water off. I am so disappointed, I used to love OXO products and designs."
1,Deserves a Negative Star,"We have had this mop for about a month, using it to clean up our tiled kitchen floor. I wish we had returned it immediately.Pros:-Lightweight-Handle for squeezing water is good-sized and easy to useCons:-Sponge does not stay in the mop, sometimes falling completely out but usually just sliding from side to side, meaning you can't put much force into mopping-Sponge doesn't wring out completely before you start mopping, leaving tons of water everywhere-Confusingly, given the previous point, the sponge won't absorb that extra water back up so we are left with huge puddles that have to air dry.-The sponge is held onto the mop with a little metal strip at the top that provides little support, so the big sponge just flops around loosely, making it impossible to scrub difficult dirt spots.This is far and away the worst mop I have ever used. Save yourself some trouble and some money and buy the cheapest off-brand mop at the big box store and you'll be more happy."
1,This mop is terrible,The mop head does not stay on and it does not strain enough of the water out. It's a waste of money. My cheap $5.00 mop from the dollar store works better than this one.
1,Avoid...or you'll be sorry you didn't,"I love OXO products in the kitchen so I figured the mop would be wonderful. Wrong. The head falls off, a lot! If you try to do anything but a straight forward, backward motion, forget it, you will be holding the nice ergonomic handle and the wet dirty head will be on the floor, which you will then get covered with dirty water while trying to figure out how to put it back on over and over. And if the head is not falling off, its getting caught up in the rollers, so that the rollers on the operators side are hitting the floor instead of the head scrubbing it. Forget trying to get all the water out to do that last clean swipe. Its not gonna happen with this mop. I wonder how long BB&B's satisfaction guar is? I am not happy to spend $25 on this which got both me and the floor dirtier!"
2,Does not last,"I bought this mop after it was recommended on Real Simple magazine. The mop does everything they say it does - but it doesn't last. A plastic part is broken near the head of my mop, so I can no longer use the squeeze function - I have to lean over and squeeez the sponge out with my hands. The head also falls off quite easily because of this broken part.Next time I am buying a mop that is mostly made of metal. Presumably this will last longer."
1,all I got was the handle,I paid $29.99 for this mop and it arrived with NO MOP HEAD. The picture clearly shows a mop head on the handle and I never would have bought it had I known it was only the handle I was buying. I find this very misleading and I am not returning it because it came in a box the size of a small car!! How ridiculous. I am NOT a happy customer!
4,Fear and Loathing of Orchid Shows,"More of an exercise in method writing than a piece of art itself, the Orchid Thief floats down a narrative river through swamps, orchid shows, Seminole history, endangered species laws until the reader is entirely swept up in the current. Susan Orlean's voice is always present yet strangely invisible to others in this oddball world of orchid fanatics, and the reader is often left wondering how she found herself in the thick of such an insular, claustrophobic culture. Towards the end, past all the engrossing anecdotes, witty style, and wistful observations, the reader feels complicit in a game of chicken with Orlean -- will you stop reading before she stops writing and exploring? Can you stop reading?Like an impressionist painting, the style overwhelms the subject to achieve a transcendental effect upon the nature of journalism."
2,Up Close and Too Personal,"As a former New Yorker and now a Florida resident for seven years, I am always eager to see fresh material on this state, its history and environment. From that standpoint, this is a book that will hold your interest although there is too much ""me"" in the book. However, from my limited knowledge, I spotted several inaccuracies that diminish the author's credibility as a careful researcher. She describes the Tamiami Trail as starting in Ft. Myers (which she spells incorrectly as Ft. Meyers). The reason it's called the Tamiami Trail is that it spans the route from Tampa to Miami. My horticultural knowledge is mostly confined to what I see in the Home Depot garden center but I know how to spell liriope, a common border plant here (she spells it loriope). It makes me wonder about how far to trust her other horticultural pronouncements."
1,WHERE'S THE CHARACTER?,"Why didn't I just read the encyclopedia for information on orchids and the Seminoles? What was so special about Laroche as a character? Was he really that boring or does Orlean really write that horribly? I hate reading books with grammatical errors, especially by a New Yorker staff writer! The Good Life chapter's final sentence ends with a preposition. This book could discourage the population from reading. I totally understand why the Harry Potter series is doing so well on the best seller list."
2,A not so notable book,"The concept of the book is good, but the execution is poor. The writing was choppy with grammatical errors, and the book needs more editing. The author inserts herself oddly into the story commenting on her inability to buy diet Cokes or on where she got her swamp sneakers, tidbits of information that were certainly not the reason I bought the book. I am an amateur orchid raiser and even I found inaccuracies in some of the information on orchids. What mystifies me is how this book got as many rave reviews."
3,Interesting magazine article with a lot of filler.,"This book is interesting yet, as has already been mentioned in other reviews, it probably should have stayed a magazine article. The book, which is already printed in large font, has a lot of sections that are obvious filler to increase the page count. I could forgive these off topic filler sections if they were at least entertaining but unfortunately they are not."
1,The Orchid Thief: A True Story of Beauty and Obsession,"If you truly love orchids, you will love this book. If you don't, this book is not for you. I chose it because I read a review that said, ""if you liked Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, you will love this book. Well, I loved Midnight, and I do not see any comparison between the two. Orchids is a series of short anecdotes of an eccentric man, whom we don't really get to know or understand. Perhaps if I had more of an interest (or passion) for flowers, I would have enjoyed this book."
3,really enjoyed the history,"how many orchids have I given as gifts over the years? how many ended up in the dump once the flowers fell off? Too many. I'd seen this in paperback at my bookstore years ago but I decided to pick it up on kindle. Still getting used to the thing. Sorry, I digress. I really enjoyed picture she paints of the cut thrat orchid hunters literally killing each other to find a new species to display in Europe. Who knew a flower could cause such insanity. Got bored with the narrator following the contemporary dude around. Wish they author had cut that by a third."
4,Very enjoyable,"I must disagree with my reading colleague in Vermont to some respect. We both agree that Mr. Laroche does not seem to be the kind of person we'd love to have over for dinner. However, where we differ is as to the appeal of this book. I am not an orchid lover (perhaps having read this book will become one), but still found the book quite enjoyable. The monomaniacal pursuit of a single species is quite fascinating.I also must disagree with Terry Holzman in the critique that this book lacks a story. The story is simply not about Mr. Laroche, or the orchid hunters, or Florida, or England - rather it is about the orchid itself."
3,What's wrong with the New Yorker...,"...is that its profiles have degenerated into this sort of book. The classic NYer profile-expanded-into-a-book was John Hershey's ""Hiroshima"" and it was followed by lots of good ones from Berton Rouche and others. This book has the same origins but the author injects herself into the book far too much and is not an interesting person in her own right. In addition to being dull, she is a condescending New Yorker (geographical reference this time) who knows nothing about the rest of America -- and it shows. This book does have its moments -- especially the accounts of the 19th century ordchid hunters and their adventures, but we are all too quickly back in the author's navel gazing."
5,Ditto 5 Star Reviews,Much has already been said. I add only: This is one of my top five favorite non-fiction reads.
3,"A good book, but a lousy audio edition","I enjoyed the content of this book, but I was listening to the unabridged audio version, and the reader was just awful; she read the book like an annoying children's story, it made it hard to even get even get through the book."
3,Only if you're into orchids...,"The Orchid Thief is less about Mr. Laroche, a selfish, self-centered and, dare I say it, jerk of a human being, than it is a study of Florida's history of orchid under-culture. If you're into orchids, it's a fascinating book. If you're not - don't bother."
2,"Given the opportunity, I wouldn't read it again.","It's unfortunate... I really wanted to like this book, but after finding nearly identical passages about Robert Fuchs and Martin Motes repeated in different parts of the book (talk about filler) I simply can't fathom giving this book a good review. Did I really need to hear that Mr. Motes drove a BMW two times?As an orchid grower, I found the author's use of the elusive ghost orchid flower as a device to tie the book together trite, as, it's really not the flowers that make ghost orchids so interesting, but the fact that they have no leaves. It all seems a bit naive to me, or perhaps a bit concocted. Parts of the story are interesting, and yes I did learn something from the book, but the whole reason for being of the book is a bit lacking."
2,Kind of slow,"I purchased this book based on a TV interview with the author I watched. At the time I read the book I knew nothing about orchids or Florida land sales. The book educated me in those areas. In reading the story I was always waiting for something to happen. It never did, so I was a little disappointed. It wasn't a bad book, but it was very slow at times."
2,"Soulda been call ""Time Thief"" cause that's what it does...","Waste your time... If you would like a humorous and interesting account of the Orchid industry, wait for another book. This one lacked story, humor, plot and drama."
3,Not what I was expecting,"I thought I was buying a romance novel of some sort based on the name and a brief description. Unfortunatly, I ended up with a story about this crazy loser and his plant hobby. For the sake of Orlean, she makes this dull subject into an interesting documentary on orchids and many of their biological traits."
3,Quirky...makes you wonder about people's sanity.,"This is a bizarre and very unique story. It fizzles a bit when she delves into the history of every orchid known to mankind. It reminds me of the peculiar lives of those in 'Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.'Note: The movie 'Adaptation' takes a nose-dive into left field with the whole porn, etc. plot. What a disgrace."
1,"no story, no plot, no drama...just long-winded verbiage",i read this book expecting some kind of genuine narrative or story -- but instead i kept confronting long passages of exposition that seemed designed to draw attention only to the writer and her stylish prose. this read like an overblown magazine piece.
1,flowery language isn't enough to keep this from wilting,i found this book to be dull and pointless. orlean's writing style isn't enough to save this book from its essentially superficial quality.
1,PASS!,What a bore! If you really want a magical reading experience there are thousands of books more worthy. This is like a 260 page magazine aritcle - and not even an interesting one. The book goes nowhere and ends in the same place. A complete waste of time and money. I skimmed through parts looking for anything to gain my interest. Before you categorize my review - I am a huge fan of the area in Florida and an orchid lover.
2,"Fast Start, Slow Finish","I came to The Orchid Thief with high expectations, the book recommended to me by several friends. I left disappointed. While the first hundred pages or so were absorbing and the extreme fascination that orchid collectors have for their plants interesting, The Orchid Thief ultimately lacked the narrative momentum and stylistic writing of, say, A Civil Action (a much, much better, and much more readable, book than this). The strain of stretching a magazine article to book length shows as the author delves into tangential and even pointless digressions about Florida history that often have nothing to do with orchids or plants or much of anything. It's just padding, and lacking a compelling central character (the author occasionally, and intriguingly, comments on her own reactions to it all, but appears to hold back just as I as a reader want to know more), the book plods on and, for the reader, proves as slow-going as a trek through a swamp."
2,Hothouse flower,"I'm a plant dork. I have a Cymbidium orchid in my bathroom right now that won't flower for me, despite pampering. I recently met an orchid nut from Florida and was inspired to read this book. Yet, about halfway through ""The Orchid Thief"", I started to lose interest. It is a similar sensation to seeing too many famous important paintings or too many fabulous flowers in a sitting. As the tales of intrigue, plunder and eccentricity started to pile up, they began to lose meaning and became, unfortunately, boring. Probably the New Yorker piece was the right length."
3,"BEAUTIFUL DESCRIPTIONS, BUT WHERE'S THE STORY?","I read Susan Orlean's excerpt in the NEW YORKER and rushed out to buy the book as I wanted to find out more about John Larouche ""the orchid thief"". I soon found out that all the ""meat"" of the story was in the NEW YORKER article and the book was nothing more than ""bun"". I wanted/hoped THE ORCHID THIEF to be a ""juicy"" tale of intrigue and adventure, but there's only a little of that in the book. Mostly we follow Ms. Orlean around Florida looking at orchids and talking to strange orchid growers. Many of her descriptions are breathtakingly beautiful and vivid, but as a STORY it really falls short. I was disappointed. (No wonder the writer who is adapting this for the screen struggled to adapt this work. I read he finally had to make up a story that really has nothing to do with the book because there isn't one within these pages.)"
4,a great read,"I'd only recently discovered the great orchid flowers when I read this book. It's beautifully written with a fantastic sense of humour and offers a bizarre and fascinating insight into some truly impressive eccentric minds. You don't need tons of horticultural expertise to enjoy this book , but by the same token, if you are a plantophile, you won't find it too 'dumbed down'. I laughed out loud numerous times reading it, but it's not all humour - it's also a gentle and open-minded foray into a world alien to the author...at the outset, at least. I'd recommend this book highly."
4,Wonderful historical romp about orchids and collectors,"This is quite an exciting romp through the swamps, forests and mountains of the world...I learned a lot about the the history of orchid collecting...yet I hope I never develop this kind of orchid mania...Thoroughly enjoyed the history of the Floridian Seminole Indians, their lucrative gambling, farming, orchid industries, and how some wily US citizens tried to exploit them (but could not outsmart them!) The Seminole Indians rock! Great read for all orchid lovers -- the things you will learn...LOL...this story makes me wonder, are we simply eccentric, passionate or really crazy with our love of orchids?"
4,Good Writing,"I expected this to be more about the Orchid Thief, so I was disappointed somewhat by Ms. Orlean's sashaying into Florida history and Seminole history.When I came to the conclusion that it was as good a book as I'd heard it to be, I was happily surprised!I've been introduced to hydroponic orchid growing, and it was important to get a feel of the hobby/art!"
4,fascinating,"Hard to say what was more interesting: the orchids themselves; the obssessed who populate this book; or Ms. Orlean who, like the unseen ghost orchid haunts her book (sorry about the pun) with her own preoccupations. It is our good fortune that these result in some wonderfully vivid descriptions of Florida,and its flora and fauna. I learned a lot about orchids, Florida, the Endangered Species Act, Seminoles and human treachery. I would know a lot less about any of these were it not for Ms.Orlean. And to Mr. Brown, editor of the North American Native Orchid Journal, lighten up!"
3,Book Wannabe,"Even though this book has passages that are fascinating and reflections that, in a couple of instances, are arresting, I have to say that, overall, it is a somewhat pokey book. I can see it more favorably as the article it once was. Book length, it has whole stretches that are pretty much just blah blah and more blah."
2,Book is all over the map,"I'm a writer by trade (news) and know how fickle the public can be, but I am still amazed at how successful this book has become.It's a pure and simple bore, with a choppy story that wanders all over world and at times seems to have lost any contact with the original focus."
2,Mired down in the swamp of bad writing,"A slice of life sketch of various people who collect orchids, this book gives accounts of those afflicted with the orchid obsession. While at times engrossing, the writer jumps around constantly, offers opinions as unsubstantiated facts, and leaves the reader wondering why some people are mentioned in the book at all. I was disappointed in this book and definitely did not catch the fever."
3,THE UNWET DIVER,FOR A BOOK ABOUT OBSESSION SUSAN ORLEANS FAILS TO BECOME POSESSED BY THE MANIA OF HER CHARECTURES AND THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES. SHE GIVES CLEAR GROUND FOR THEIR DEMENTIA TO BE CLEARLY SEEN. THE SAME HOWEVER CANNOT BE SAID OF THE NITTPICKING REVIEWERS WHO FAIL TO ENJOY A GOOD STORY ABOUT THE WEIRDNESS OF REALITY. ORCHIDS ARE A PRIME EXAMPLE OF THE BEAUTY OF THE OUTRE' AND THIS BOOK HITS TOO CLOSE TO HOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO ENGROSS THEMSELVES IN THIER ALLURE.
3,"wondeful characters, good description conquered by boring...","This book has to be one of the best described books i've ever read. What makes the description even better is the characters, so greatly defined you could mistake them for your best friend. However, there is a little problem...boredom. This book is extremely boring and difficult to get through at parts, this will make you skip pages of the book and eventually skip to the end, where you will say 'i could have wrote that in two pages, easy';. Then you will realize you actually only read two pages. I loved the beginning of the book, i really did, but by the time it got to the end i was so bored i fell asleep and barely remembered any of it. I give Susan Orlean an around of applause for taking a challenge like this, i give Susan Orlean a stick of dynamite and tell her to stick it in her head to clear it for taking on a challenge like this. NO author could save this book from the enemy of boredom. My grade: B-"
5,up-side down photograph,"I have been growing orchids for many years, and it bothers me that the photograph on the cover of a phalenopsis flower is up-side down. Was this done on purpose or is it an error? I have a feeling it is an error which is unfortunate because it spoils the cover."
1,A very long journal article,"This novel contained too much excessive detail and facts pertaining not only to orchids, the obssession with orchids, but also pertaining to the swamp and characters within. When Susan Orlean left her journalistic viewpoint and just wrote about Laroche and others and their obsession with orchids the story became interesting and at times quite funny."
1,"Interesting protagonist, fascinating topic, clumsy presentat","The work of a journalist not a writer. Disjointed, with some very interesting snippets but no thematic coherence and clumsy phrasing. A very bad book."
1,For Orchid Historians Only,"One of the members of my book club chose this book mainly because she loves true stories. We were all sorely disappointed in this book. We found it to be slow and boring and was a chore to get through. The only people who could enjoy this book would be orchid historians or the orchid ""philes"" described in the book."
1,Too much undeserving praise,"This book is simply awful. Orlean simply saw one odd piece of news, exploited it to every angle imaginable, and completely bored me along the way. A good author could get the point of the book across in about thirty pages, but Orlean uses 200. This isn't a book, it's just a collection of newspaper clippings. Please do not support this terrible literature; if you're going to buy it just get it from a library."
1,Only for the extremely curious,"Can't figure out why this got such rave reviews. Based on those raves, I expected a book highlighting the motivations behind, and the experience of, obsession. Instead the book reads as a litany of botanical trivia and unintersting personal details about the author. I put the book down with only fifty pages to go...something I've almost never done."
3,The controversy swirls on...still a good read,"Susan Orlean has really done it this time. She has written a book about, ""passion itself, and the amazing lengths to which people will go to gratify it."" Is it any wonder that her readers feel so passionately about this book. Many orchid experts find fault with the book's facts and criticize the lack of passion for orchids from Ms. Orlean while lovers of a good story and that crazy world known as south Florida rave about it. For my part, I enjoyed reading the Orchid Thief. It reads like a novel, so while I did notice a horticultural error or two myself, I was not reading it as a reference book, but for entertainment. I didn't find it to be quite the page turner I was expecting, but the characters are memorable, the stories are interesting and Ms. Orlean's writing is a pleasure. I am an amazon.com associate."
5,Some times you feel like a nut.........,"This book is about the orchid growing scene in Florida and goes on at length about smuggling of native plants from the local preserve as well as around the world, the big orchid shows held there, the feuds between the prominent growers in the area and the generally wacky demeanor of the various colorful characters involved in the activities of orchid ""society"" in this suspiciously hot and humid local.If you have ever belonged to a specialty horticutural society and questioned your sanity when caught up in the thrall of your favorite plant, this book will make you feel like the very picture of placid normalcy when compared to orchid growers.Humorous, and a quick read, I recommend this book to all those plant persons who are not afraid of seeing perhaps the tiniest fragment of themselves reflected in the fascinatingly consumed characters portrayed in this book."
4,"Unique hobby, unique people","An interesting story about the lure of a segment of the population that has become enchanted by orchids. The author follows one of these eccentrics, John Laroche an orchid collector all the while portraying other characters that are hooked on orchids explained with side stories. Most of these collectors seem to exhibit some type of fatal character flaw brought on by their infatuation for orchids. Fast,light educational reading that sheds some light on a unique hobby that attracts its share of unique people."
3,Interesting...,"Susan Orlean is an amazing writer; she has taken a subject for which she has professed no interest, (she gave orchids away to avoid their ultimate never-ending appeal!) and yet she has managed to write a gripping account of her time spent persuing the accounts of an orchid-thief/lunatic/self-proclaimed genius.I quickly read through this well written book through 2 flu-ridden afternoons. Susan's swamp predicaments, ability to make a magazine-style story enfold into an entire book, and dead-pan humor, made me follow through to the end. I couldn't help but relate to the tales of Orchid afficianados: as I was reading, I was snatching glimpses at my own multiple rows of double, triple and quadruple leafed but currently flowerless white phaleonopsis.I am looking forward to a novel from this writer - she is truly talented!"
5,Monogram: Q Thirsty Sandstone Coaster Set,"The coasters are beautiful and versitle. When they say thirstystone, they really mean it. All moisture was asorbed by the coaster thus avoiding white rings on wood furniture. I definitly would recommend this product to friends and family."
3,Thirsty stone not quite so durable,"I had several absorbastone coasters that I loved, but I couldn't find them anywhere now. I did run across these thirsty stone coasters and felt they would be extremely similar. Here's the positive: they do absorb fluid and will not stick to your glasses, the monogram image looks nice. Unfortunately they are real sandstone and I have noticed them beginning to deteriorate. As a result there are small grains of sand on the table that will surely scratch the furniture which is what I am trying to protect with these coasters! Additionally the cork is stuck on the bottom by someone who doesn't care. I don't think you could eccenter it any more if you tried. I was really hoping for a great coaster for everyday and guest use but this really isn't it."
4,Durable Coasters,We order two sets and are very happy with them. They arrived quickly and in excellent shape. I did mark them down by one star because the cork backing on them are not centered. Probably being too picky. The tops were centered and looked very elegant. All in all we are very pleased with them.
5,Very Cool Coasters,"I was a little nervous ordering these coasters because of a few bad reviews, but mine are perfect. Very classy looking. No imperfections I can detect. They look so good you almost hate to cover them up by setting a glass on them. Totally satisfied."
4,fits any decor!,"Very nice looking product, and quality, too. I bought these for a gift and they were a hit!"
4,Thirstystone Still the Best Coaster,"I've had several coasters in my home over the years, and the Thirstystone is still the best, hands down. Purchased these with a holder also and they look good on the side table in the holder or sitting on the table holding a cold iced tea. Took one star away for a couple of reasons: 1) their monogramming could be improved--the design was off-center on a couple of the coasters; 2) the stones themselves don't look like the picture or what I have gotten in the past--the monogram color is the same as the ""H"" picture but there is no variation of color in the sandstone like I'm used to seeing--the stones are the same color all over so not quite as interesting to look at. They have a more manufactured, less natural look. If you want to know what the stone I received looks like, look at the picture for the ""S"" monogram. Still, they soak up just about all the condensation that sweet tea can muster!"
4,She has a great voice,"The CD is good and yes, maybe the music is not very original but her singing is very good. I listen to this CD pretty often. At least you can hear the emotions here. Not like in the songs of Mariah or Celine. Not to mention Whitney who's so lost and desperate to make some money that it's not even funny. I would recommend it but still waiting for a GREAT one. She can do it."
1,What a shame!,I listened to this album only once! What a pity! Edyta forgot her own style. Now she is copy of Mariah Carey and Celine Dion. If I want to listen to Mariah or Celine I will buy their albums. I'm sure that a lot of people think the same. I come from Poland and I think only people from Poland will buy this CD.
1,Unoriginal and disappointing,"Unfortunately Miss Edyta let herself be lured by the world of cheesy tunes, wrote either for her or peformed by some other artists. I don't think she has much chance of conquering the Western markets with this unoriginal repertoire. For some reason her voice is not as excellent as it was the case on the earlier Polish record, 'Dotyk'. It seems to be dampened down, and lacks that unique 'colour' and variety we have heard before. The songs' monotonous tone definitely does not help her perfom to the best of her ability. Edyta, you can definitely do better!"
4,First in a series of young pilots in the Battle of Brittain,"This is the first of a series of three books in a series with a background of the Battle of Britain. The other two titles are: The Fight of the Few and Wings of Victory.The story is somewhat predictable, but the book gives a very good feeling. The aspects of pilot training in the late pre-war years, moving up to real airplanes.The problems of how to find and attack another problem in the sky in the days before missiles and radar are quite interesting."
1,GENERAL OVERVIEW,"This book lacks specifity such as not giving exact parametersfor water/breeding conditions, i.e the book states ""mollies in general prefer their ph on the alkaline side of the ph scale.""No exact figure is given & for the beginner in particular this could present a problem. This book appears to be old but I cannot confirm this as there is no publishing date listed.There are also too many photos which would be wonderful if this were an aquarium picture gallery but the photo space could have been better used to supply more detailed info."
4,tear jerker,I've been looking for this DVD in the stores and couldn't find it. I like this story very much. It's sad and my teenagers made fun of me for bawling like a baby but it was a good release. I like the way this story incorporates use of untraditional treatments for diseases. I agree wholeheartedly that our attitude is everything and we can find happiness even in the face of death.
4,My Life,"amazing funny and touching film, I bought it so I could share with my children who are new parents."
5,whew!,"an amazing movie...i was totally drawn in from the opening scene..michael keaton is fantastic..the scenes with his father and family made me feel like i was reliving my childhood..nicole kidman was wonderful..if u have ever suffered the loss of a loved one, this movie will make an incredible connection with you.scenes from this movie will stay with me for a long time...don't miss it..."
5,"Great, Great, Great, Great, Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",I Loved This Movie. It Made Me Cry And I Am A Grown Man. Michael Keaton Is Great In This Movie. You Need To Get This Movie.
5,"""Tears on a Child""","This has been one of the best movies for the 1990 years. Micheal Keaton and Nicole Kidman make a great couple in this romantic/tear-jerker movie. I used ""Tears on a Child"" as my review title because this movie focuses on a child who is being born into a family whom one-of-which of the parents are dying! Its so sad how M.K. tries to show his love for his son as he tapes all the father things he should teach his child, sex, he struggles on. It has a little bit of humor along with the movie. This was a great and sad movie. WATCH IT!"
3,Great movie but DVD edition is Full frame version only,"I was so looking forward to own this movie on DVD. I purchased it through amazon.ca and contrary to the description on the website, what I received was the Full Frame version only and not the Widescreen/Full version as advertized. Please be aware when ordering this title. The movie itself is awesome."
1,not what I expected,"I bought this movie on the recommendation of a friend. While the plot of the movie was a good one, I couldn't help but feel like I had missed some portion of the movie. I kept holding on for some outstanding or momentous event and at the end I was left feeling like I had just wasted my time watching the movie and spending money to buy it. They could have done so much more and it just left me feeling completely unsatisfied."
4,One of Nicole's best,"Nicole Kidman has had a handful of great films, MY LIFE being one of them. Nicole plays the wife of Michael Keaton, a busy executive who learns that he has cancer. He is given only months to live and decides to video tape ""advice"" to his yet unborn child. Both Keaton and Kidman convincingly portray a couple dealing with the situation, and it is one of those films that will bring tears to your eye. I first saw it in 1993 and didn't think that much of it then (I can't remember why). Watching it 10 years later made me appreciate it more and notice the fine performances.This is a movie worth buying. However, the DVD is disappointingly presented in pan/scan. Why the distributor did not take advantage of the original widescreen aspect ratio that the film is available in, is beyond me. I dislike pan/scan because much image is lost."
5,A great book for the nightstand !,Paramahansa Yogananda offers eastern spiritual treasures in ways I as a westerner can understand. A great collection of paragraphs that improve one's way of looking at life.
5,EXCELLENT BOOK,"Throughout the years, I have bought about 30 copies of this book. I end up giving them away to friends in need of healing and inspiration. I just gave my last copy away and I am on here ordering more. An excellent book with wonderful information. I would recommend this book to everyone!"
3,Better Than Most Travel Books on New Zealand,"The author does a pretty fair job of evoking the spirit of New Zealand. She gets around most of the country and is able to fill you in with tidbits of regional interest. However, it must be noted that her opinion of Queenstown-Glenorchy-Paradise is completely off-base (in my opinion). I can't agree with her assessment of everything being Texas style big,either.She doesn't spend much time in any area so her book doesn't reflect a strong 'feel' of place like a Bill Bryson or Paul Theroux book would. The author spends more print time on her rental motorcycle than I care to know about. Even with these disclaimers she does a better job than most others, thus making it a worthy read."
5,Great gloves,"These work perfectly. I am very, very pleased. Nice price. They fit well and are comfortable. I have nothing more to addd. Just filling up the space."
2,No Omar & Sophia in this film,"Okay -- I'm in advertising, so I dislike false advertising. When I bought this product, I thought that I was buying the film with Omar Sharif and Sophia Loren. The description of the product was so scanty, I didn't know that I was buying a religious film about the miracles of Christ. I felt that the seller was purposely being deceptive. I sent the video back. All my money was returned, but who wants to go through the hassle? Hopefully, the seller is now plainly describing what this video is about. Nothing wrong with a film about the miracles of Christ, but be honest about what you're selling! At the time that I purchased this video, there was no photo of the product either. I see now that there is."
1,Terrible product,"The full description of this item is not given on Amazon. It is a 1/2 hour video of a guy talking about a few of Jesus' Miracles in brief. The Christian viewer with adequate scriptural scholarship already knows these stuff. For the non-Christian, not having read the accounts of miracles in the Gospels, the presentation makes no sense. The bottom line of this video is that the miracle behind the miracles is that Jesus didn't make a big deal of himself but glorified the Father.If the video was free I would have kept it, but for almost $10.00 I am sending it back. I rather buy a good book about Jesus or the videos of the Gospel of John, or Luke."
5,Genetics of Infectious Disease Susceptibility,The book was in great condition and I received it within several days of the order!
3,A good read but get a new proof-reader!,"I got a fair bit from this book even after 7 years of web design and Photoshop experience. It does tend to lean rather heavily on graphic-intensive designs (as you would expect given that Photoshop is one of the 2 tools in the title) and gives less focus to designing tight HTML and small sites than I would have liked. That said, the sections on graphic optimisation are pretty useful and the overall book is a good read.Photoshop features heavily but the GoLive information is fairly short and I get the impression this was probably hastily bolted on to an existing Photoshop-only text.My only real complaint (which is a nit-pick) would be that this must be the worst proof-read book I have ever come across. Not only are there typos and spelling errors on pretty much every page but I actually found at least one editor's comment in the text too!"
2,This book not for newbies to Photoshop or webdesign,"I got about a third of the way through this book and folded it up and sent it back - a disappointing reading experience. The first section was sufficient enough with general content on webdesign, layout principles, and image formats. But then, when you arrived at the section regarding Photoshop's tools and how to use them, the real nuts and bolts of the textbook, the author just kind of blows everything at you all at once - like out of a cannon. The pages are filled with many bold-text terms and not much explanation on these terms. Secondly, the section on the layers palette- probably one of the most important tools of Photoshop- just a few pages of general terms with hardly no explanation of how to use the program. By the time I finished the palette section, I was totally muddled. So no, don't buy this book unless you are very experienced with Photoshop's tools and operations."
3,Good Sell - Doesn't Live Up to It!,Found this book a little helpful for web design. New to web design so need something with tutorials. This wasn't it. If you want to learn Photoshop for the web DO NOT purchase this book. Try Photoshop 6 Down and Dirty Tricks (ISBN: 0967985307) instead.
4,Good quality,The quality of the cards are good. The plastic cards hold up longer. I would definitly buy these again in the future.
2,Low quality graphics and paper stock,The graphics on these cards are not crisp and artistic. The pictures look cheap and the colors are muted. Also the cards are not glossy but satin in shine. I will not buy cards from this seller again.
4,"Good cards, but 2 small warnings","Basic Scopa deck, but 1) smaller size than normal deck and 2) the cards do not have numbers on them, so when playing you have to be aware of which person pertains to which status and count the symbols. I ordered another deck after I received this one. Kept this deck as well though, since shipping was more than the cost of the deck. Wish I looked more closely at the picture before ordering."
2,Didn't understand it.,I didn't like the game didn't understand it and it was not like the real scopa game. The Directions to it was in a different langue so thats why. I just don't like it.
1,Italian Sicilian Scopa playing cards,"Well, the cards are slick and inexpensively made, which I can ""deal"" with. However, there is one card missing. I will have to mark the copyright card accordingly,"
4,One of the biggest corporate debacles in American history,"Greed and hubris are rampant here, and the house of cards that was Enron came crashing down. Unfortunately, it also took many innocents along with it. I would have given it 5 stars had it been able to expose more of what most of us know to be the manipulation of aspects of the Bush Administration's national energy policy - recall that Ken Lay was the largest individual contributor to GW's 2000 election, and Enron was the largest corporate contributor. Bush used to call Ken Lay ""Kenny Boy"", but he became ""Mr. Lay"" after the scandal broke. Hopefully this documentary will keep a few more eyes open in the future."
4,Will We Ever Be Able to Run Far Enough Away?,"Very enjoyable. But all I could think as I watched it (July 2009) is that no one in the financial industry learned a thing. The smartest guys in another room developed collateralized debt obligations, which magically let you take worthless crap, mix it with other worthless crap, then slice it and sell it as AAA. There are always smart guys in a room somewhere (Bernie Madoff, anyone?) and if they tell you they have a black box for making money, you should start running in the other direction, very very quickly."
4,Great Documentary/Tragedy,"When I went to the theater to see this movie, I was afraid they would veer into the political aspect and what not. I was rather surprised that our President was only mentioned a few times and because it was needed for the story to make sense.It's very well done and outstandingly narrated. Very coherent, very human, very informative. It shows just a little slice of what might (and probably is) going on today in corporate America. Very compelling. A must for informed citizens and investors."
2,Stick to Bethany's book,"All over the place this movie is: full of noise, flash, and unnecessary fluff to hit the viewer over the head. Stick to Bethany's book for the complete story."
3,Read the book BEFORE viewing,"The film is a montage of interviews and news clips of some of the real people involved in the Enron collapse, not actors. The book of the same title, ""Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room"" is much better, simply watching this DVD by itself will NOT give you an understanding of the Enron fiasco. Viewing the film without having read the book is a waste of time but once you've read the book the film gives the story a lot more depth.If you only want to read one book about Enron, the book gives an excellent overview of the Enron debacle. Although it glosses over many of the details of the disaster it excels at giving the big picture and making it comprehensible. For a fuller perspective on what happened and why it happened you'll want to read ""Conspiracy of Fools"", ""Enron, The Rise and Fall"" and ""24 Days"" as well."
3,Should I laugh or Cry!!!,"I expected so much out of this movie; however, it turned out to be a major disappointment. I attended businesses school at a top national univ and I fail to see the logic behind the dialectical good and evil rhetoric this movie portrays."
1,"Travesty of a Film, Complete waste of time","I brought this movie after reading all the positive reviews. But as usual it turned out be the usual hype. This movie tries to appeal to the female segments by using positively dressed female narrators who somehow are remotely related to the Enron story. This movie does not cover by any means what was Enron actually doing? What was Anderson doing? How did they inflate earnings? It tries to demonify skilling and Lay, by identifying their greed. Well what Harvard MBA is not in for the money? what corporation is not trying to whatever it takes to stay afloat? To sum up, this movie completely fails to explain what enron was doing and why was it bad? Any college educated person will find this movie a complete waste of time."
1,A Disappointment,"Could have been a seminal work on some of the most egregious robber-barons of the 1990's, but succumbed to a ridiculous partisanship characterized by heavy-handed Bush-bashing -- how tiresome (this even tho Kenny-Boy was head of Ann Richards's finance committee when Bush challenged her). Meanwhile, one of the documentary's great moralizers was investigations-target Bill Lerach, and one of the chief complainers was the since-recalled Gray Davis, who was so incompetent he couldn't sell beer on a troopship."
5,Profound realization - American people need to watch out for Republican Party Agenda,"After watching this movie, I was shocked, but now know the truth. I thought the CA power issue was due to mis-management of CA state. What also scares me after Enron, and Tom Delay are the moral ability of the Republican party to lead this nation. Maybe this explains why things are now the way they are. I definitely won't be passive about voting anymore in the future. The Republican party seems to always find some excuse to favor big business, and says it generates jobs. Now, it seems we've seen what big business does when they get too big, and get the ""we do it because we can"" attitude. It is down right scary for the common person. This movie definitely shocked me to the core about big business, concentration of power, and the ""Republican Party"" agenda to try and stay in White house indefintely, i.e. Tom Delay. This is not what our founding fathers intended. Definitely watch this movie."
4,Interesting & Educational,"If you want to know the basics of the Enron scandal this is the place to start. Great documentary.What a joke...Amazon said one more word is required. ""Word!"" I had forgotton why I didn't mess with reviewing products for them. Now I'm reminded."
5,worth the money,I think this is a fascinating and well done documentary. If you like documentaries this is perfect.
5,Great Business Movie,"I am in the transportation industry and I'm currently studying for my Series 3 exam for Commodities and this movie gave me a lot of information on what to and not to do. This is a great business movie for anyone. It's a documentary and long, but if you're into business you'll love it, but your it's not something to watch for fun. This was produced by the Dallas Mavericks' Mark Cuban."
3,Pretty Good but could have been better,This give some insight into the Enron company and peoples behavior but it could have covered so much more. Like how the were able to achieve so much power and the people that helped them. Also it was not up to date with recent events.
4,Must-view item for students taking business courses,"I found this documentary to offer a very in-depth and profound view of what went wrong at Enron.This video is applicable to many business classes in the undergraduate and graduate curriculum. However, I would recommend viewing it where people nearby won't be offended by some harsh language and brief nudity. The segment about the gentleman's club could have been done more tastefully or in a much shorter duration as it does not add any educational value (in the business/ethical sense) to the core concept of the video.Throughout the movie, I was curious about Amanda Martin-Brock's accent. It turns out she was born in Swaziland and was raised in Zimbabwe and South Africa. She then moved to Louisiana to obtain her law degree, eventually becoming licensed to practice law in Louisiana and Texas. Her accent sounded British but with a hint of Southern United States. She is now the President and Chief Operating Officer at Water Standard Company."
5,A moral passion play . . .,"This is a great documentary which captures the go-go 90's, the rise of the internet, and the rise(and fall)of funny money. Maybe they were the smartest guys at Enron, but they were silk-suit wearing con men who operated a macho ponzi scheme that bilked countless investors who felt secure that something so big could never fall so fast. It is an indictment of corporate greed . . . and I say this as a conservative. This is capitalism run amok. The movie puts the rise and fall of Enron in its proper context . . . a metaphor for the '90's . . . when the only direction on wall street was up."
5,Amazingly Engrossing,"From the time this documentary starts you are captured. I have never been so engrossed in a story about Corporate America before. The arrogance of business and the manipulation for self gain was astounding. Awesome how the unravelling began with one simple question. I have watched this now several times and I never cease to be amazed. A ""must"" to watch."
3,Works on computer only,"Watch out, this one only runs on a computer & that wasn't made obvious in the description. That's what WMVHD means. If you want the DVD which plays on a regular DVD player, buy the 1-disc set which is actually a valuable one to have. It's a very good story, very enlightening & informative."
3,Wow!,"Very interesting video. Facinating to see the corruption ignite, spread and take over. Hard to believe the leap from morality can be so easy and so complete."
4,Great + important = watch,"This is a great film/documentary...Pros:-Informative and educating about today's issues...-Well-madeCons:-Children (the most crucial members of society, who should be watching this more than anyone) won't be able to watch it, because of the inclusion of a bafflingly unnecessary, long, drawn-out stripper scene, with full-nudity. (it's like actually going to a strip club, except you're watching a documentary). I was so disappointed, because I advocate showing these kinds of documentaries in schools (and at home)."
5,A stunning indictment of corporate greed,A carefully documented history of the rise and fall of Enron and its unscrupulous leaders. I use it to teach business ethics at the college level.
3,"Entertaining, not thorough & informative","It was too dramatized, I thought. Also I didn't like the stripper scene because it was too long and too much nudity for my taste... gross. You lose concentration from what they're talking about. They could have just narrated the story about the strippers, why show so much nudity in a corporate scandal documentary???Better off reading the book called ""Conspiracy of Fools""... very good reading material and informative, not too dramatic like this ""documentary"""
5,A Must-See for all accounting majors,"If you have to watch a movie over and over, you may as well pick ""Enron - the Smartest Guys in the Room."" I should know; I teach accounting at a community college, and I had to watch the show twice in a row. It got better with each watching!This is a good movie from the point of view of the accounting teacher, because it talks about some of the major violations of accounting principles that were committed by the managers at Enron. But the movie is also good from the point of view of a person who has had no accounting, because it doesn't go into great detail, and explains the accounting violations in simple terms.To paraphrase Bethany McLean in the movie, ""Enron.."" wasn't so much about the numbers as it was about the people. And the audience should come away with a sense of outrage that people can and will do this sort of thing. And as Sherron Watkins said, it can happen again. This whole fiasco should be a wake-up call."
3,A good and interesting book,"Sixth Grade Can Really Kill You is a interesting book you've got to read. It will really abduct your mind!It starts with a girl named Helen who hardley made it to the sixth grade.(she's not very great at reading,spelling,and social st.)She thinks this year might be better than the others,but when she gets Mrs. Lobb, everything is back like last year.She decides to live up to her nickname ""Bad Helen"",until she finds out she might flunk,then everything geos wrong.This is a good book, and I acclaim that you should read it."
5,Great read!,"My favorite DeClements book.Poor Helen. She is always getting into trouble; she just can't help herself. To top it off, she thinks she's dumb because she is reading on a second grade level.The antics of Helen made me enjoy her as a character even more. She wants to do the right thing, but she seems to be at the wrong end of the spectrum."
1,Terrible Book Don't Read!,This is one of the most boring books I have read! It lost my interest many times. My suggestion to you is don't take time to read this book. It totally stinks!
4,Product works,Product works the qulity is not as good as the orginal part but that is par for the course noadays. Old one lasted ten years this one will proably last about three.
5,MUST read for business and personal life!,"As a business consultant, I have read hundreds of business, psychology and sales books throughout the years. I have purchased many copies of the Negotiation Boot Camp book and audio CDs to train our financial advisor clients on Wall Street and throughout the world. Why? It's simply the most straightforward, real world and useful advice on negotiation out there! Whether you are looking to acquire and retain business relationships or negotiating with your 2 year old to finally go to sleep every night ;-), you MUST get this book! And hey...the author is from Brooklyn. How much more ""real"" can you get?"
4,Interesting,"I can see the author leading classes and training sessions for timid negotiators like me. Appreciated his focus on win-win if possible rather than winner take all attitude. Easy to read, well organized"
3,clear but too basic,With clear examples but it was difficult to take out a systematic approach to get better deals. It shows some practical ideas but not with a structured way from conflict to satisfaction or what could be a real better deal in different situations.
5,"Wife loves them, very nice, great matched pair.",What can I say - they're everything the description says. They are beautiful and were well matched. Mounts are nice and solid. Excellent general wear size.
2,Great short story - lousy book,"This book worked for about the first 30 pages and then not at all after that. The idea of a bunch of screwed up shrinks getting together was very creative and the execution of it was hysterical. The whole thing about the out-of-body experience didn't work and the book went downhill from there. I felt like I was wasting my time and couldn't wait until this book was over. I skipped a bunch of pages toward the back and resumed reading at the end, but it never got as good as in the beginning."
2,Batter up - this book is flat as a pancake!,"This is a novel of internal monologue and external dialogue experienced by a clinical psychologist as he meets his professional colleagues for brunch at a pancake house. An abridged version appeared in the New Yorker as a piece of short fiction - and that in itself ought to tell you something about the audience for which the novel is intended.Antrim is a darling of the NYT Review of Books, and this novel fits the formula to a T: a book about upscale, well-educated white people nattering on, in an unusual and diverting way, about the particular neuroses and life events and issues typical of that group.Nothing much gets said or done, and in the end you're left to contemplate how this sort of fiction is actually remarkably well symbolized by pancakes: light, sweet, fluffy, homogenous, mild in flavor, and probably bad for you, yet there's always a new way to prepare it. (Can someone say CREPES?)I didn't like it very much. Your mileage may vary."
3,Health Outdoor BP-15 mounting plate,"It'a OK, about what I expected. Plastic won't last in the Kansas heat & sun! I ordered one and was billed and paid for two. Cost me because I had to pay the return shipping cost. Summary; my bad experience cost me!"
2,Disappointing,I got several of the matching birdhouses and mounting plates for my Dad. He was disappointed in how these things fitted on the birdhouses and said he would be figuring out some other base plate for the bird houses.
2,About what I expected,"I have used these weights for years in our local health club. I wanted a set to use at home and I knew exactly what I was getting. The only surprise is the ends of the bar now screw on instead of clips. And they continually work themselves loose during the course of a workout. Not sure why they changed this from the original, I am from the school of ""if it ain't broke don't fix it""."
1,Either it is Amazon or Viewsonic's fault,"I ordered this on Apr 1, Amazon listed 1-2 weeks delivery. On Apr 20, I asked for status, they say it will ship Apr 21. Then Apr 21 I got an email, it will ship July 14 or something like that due to delay. Amazon should not hold orders that is 3 months delay. I waited a month now with no LCD."
1,"Misinformation from ""High Capacity""","I jusy wanna know why this so-called ""High Capacity"" company refuse to clearly mention all the details about the batteries it's selling.I bought this battery for twice the price of other, assuming it will be equivilent to the original Panasonic battery that comes with the camera, a 5400mah one. But the one I got was a 3400mah one.Nowhere on the product details there is info about the real capaity of the battery, so actually the info is identical to the one on the smaller and heaper batteries of the same company - how am I suppose to know about the real featurs of the product I'm buying?!...not to mention the misleading name for a battery company, it's like I'll call my company ""high speed"" and will offer a product under the title ""high speed cars"" when I'm actually selling a 60 years old junk-yard cars.bottom line - this product and company are all that is still bad in online shopping!"
2,very disappointing game,The only thing that give this toy any stars IMO is that my kids like to play the music fromtime to time.the game is too simple and not very interesting at all.WE are huge game fans here. GO with Candy land instead.
2,the horse on the trunk fell off!!!,"ok i bought this as my friend's bday gift..he LOVES ferrari 599 and i had been seeking it for so long and finally i founded thiswhen i received it, everything was just right, well sealed and it looked so cuteBUT when i gave it to my friend, he was so excited and unwrapped it.. it happened it happened!the horse icon on the back trunk flipped up and the tail of the horse was folded over...i think this is bcz the factory did not adhere it welli was 100% embarrassed ... that was like a 160 bucks bday gift and limited edition..he must have thought that it was a fake and cheap 599 model which i got from some 2nd hand store... craaaappp"
4,Fabulous Drawings,The story is cute and the drawings are fabulous; my four-year-old grandson enjoys the book. My complaint is the seller should have used a better mailing envelope. The bottom right corner of the book came with deep creases.
2,scarier than expected,"My family owns another book by Eve Bunting, Scary, Scary, Halloween, so I thought this one would be similar, but it is much scarier. I will not be reading this one to my kids. The real problem is the illustrations. The coffin with blood, the vampire in the bathtub - this is a bit much for the pre-school crowd. While Scary, Scary, Halloween has a warm orange jollyness to it with beautiful bright pictures that my kids love - this one has a very grey yucky feel to it. I know Halloween is supposed to be a little spooky, but I don't want to give my kids nightmares."
1,My 1st grader had nightmares,"This book was read to the kids in my son's 1st grade class yesterday, and last night he had nightmares. I expressed my dissatisfaction to the teacher who sent the book home with him today for me to have a look and see that it was ok. It is NOT ok - bloody coffin, vampire in the bathtub, eery ghosts flying around, mummy in the bed winking at visitors, skeleton jumping out at you from the closet, funeral music playing - gray, sinister looking pictures - going quite overboard for 6 year-olds. I do not at all appreciate the school scaring my child without my consent especially while we do not expose him to any Halloween scary stuff at home. Stay away from this book! I am sure there are literary pieces for kids out there that nurture the brighter side of this ""holiday""."
5,Silly Fun!,"My 3 1/2 & 21 month old sons love this book and insist I read it to them evry night before bedtime. The artwork is attention grabbing and the prose has a nice cadence. Of course I throw in my own personal sound effects for the witches, ghosts, werewolf & Frankenstein. This just gets them giggling like crazy. This book is not too scary for the littlest kids, because if you look closely, there's almost always a 'hidden' item which helps explains the 'spooky' stuff. You can point this out as you go along. The surprise ending is quite nice too. I highly reccommend this book for kids 18 months to 5 years."
5,Great Book,I started reading this book to my kids when they were both around the age of four. Now they are about six and eight and they still love it. Funny book.
2,Rather creepy for the faint-hearted.,"Purchased for my 3 young girls. We found the illustrations rather creepy. If your kids are easily scared and you don't want to explain the afterlife, I would avoid this title."
4,Cute book,"My son really likes this book and is currently requesting it most every night. At four years old I don't think he has any idea what a Haunted House is, but he loves seeing the monsters, ghosts and skeletons."
2,Laughably Bad!!!,"Wow, where to begin with this movie. It was just plain dumb. It has bland terrible dialog, they overdo the fake blood splatter, and the actors have no emotion in their voice. A man named Bill Loomis (who plays himself) is called Mr. Halloween because he runs a cheesy haunted house in this garage. He kidnaps teenagers and uses their body parts as props. Jill, played by Shannon Eastman, is probably the only worthy character, and that's not saying a lot. It is very stupid, but somewhat entertaining. Unless you're desperate for a bad movie, I wouldn't recommend MR. HALLOWEEN!!!"
2,Mr Halloween,"There is a chill in the air and soon Halloween will be here again. Maybe that's why i've been digging out horror movies i've yet to watch. Mr. Halloween is probably the only independent horror film i've watched that is nearly two hours long. The story is pretty good and had lots of promise. Then again as i've said before no movie has a good synposis followed by overall, you'll be disappointed with this movie. Mr. Halloween suffers from poor acting and it moves at a very slow pace; it could have been cut down to the standard hour thirty, forty minutes. There is a few good kills and inside the haunted house was good. The ending confused me and I guess I must have missed a cruical part of the film because I was lost. Anyways, a decent pick up for a movie but not the best independent film out there.As so other reviewers state, the clown on the cover is nowheres to be found within the film."
2,oh please,All I can say is why waste your money or time. This is so fakey it made me ill. I got to waste my time watching this poor dvd they call a movie. Beeing a Big Fan of Indy horror I was very well not pleased. This is TRASH...
1,Very Bad,"The DVD is poorly edited and insulting to anyone keenlyinterested in trad. blues/Robert Johnson/ and modern bluesinterpretors. The viewer is presented with only tiny segments of actual performers playing. 5 minutes listening to some psuedo intellectual bilge followed by 2 minutes of part of a song. Keb Mo and G. Love get their performances butchered into 40 second-two minute clips. This DVD is like AM radio-you never get a full song from anybody. Forget this and get ""Can't You Hear the Wind Howl""."
4,"ROBERT Mugge, ROBERT Johnson... coincidence?","Finally, a real movie about Robert Johnson and the myths that surround him (instead of a fictional ""Karate Kid At The Crossroads"" or a self-serving John Hammond bio.) In one movie you get to: decide for yourself about the alleged RJ film snippet... hear Steve LaVere and other scholars be, well, scholarly... and best of all enjoy the music of Blues and rock greats like Robert Lockwood, Honeyboy Edwards, Keb Mo, Alvin YB Hart and Rory Block. If RJ the man or myth interests you at all, you should check this out. And while you're at it pick up a couple copies of the newly re-released ""Deep Blues"" also by Robert Mugge. (Trust me, it's been out of print for too long... Don't risk it again.) Enjoy!"
1,Very Poor - except for Rory Block's performance,"I agree with most of the other reviewers that this is a very weak production with lots of pretentious talk and some pretty poor musical performances which are heavily cut to make more room for chatter. However the couple of minutes where Rory Block sings ""If I had Possession Over Judgement Day"" are worth the entire price of this DVD. Don't buy the tape 'cos you'll have to sit through so much stuff you won't make it, but on the DVD you can go straight to Rory Block and never watch the rest."
3,Good but Boring,"D. Leadbetter is a great golf teacher but one dvd just about swing is to slow and boring. Instead of this, do buy ""From beginner to winner"" (same author), it is more usefull and easy to watch."
1,Pure drek,"This film missed the boat in so many ways. I will grant you that the sets are good, BUT the acting (a few exceptions), the directing, the scripting and the editing are uniformly baaaaaaaaad. Tom Skerrit and Mindy Cohn did the most with the little they were given, Jacqueline Bisset (Christine/Mrs. DeLuca), unfortunately, did not. The young leads lack the skills to do anything with their material. The whole film was much like watching 8 year olds putting on a play and thinking up their dialog as they went along. Bad."
3,Book fine - shipping took long,The book was new as expected but the shipping took a long time. There was no notice of the book which said it was in stock - turning out to not be in stock and thus a long delay in being shipped. I was about to cancel the order when I finally got an email advising the book was being shipped shortly.
3,Good bible for the price,"I'll start out with an admittance that I'm prejudice, I'm tired of having to buy China, this bible was made in China and the pages don't turn easily, great price good deal just page turning not too good and I was planning on using this as a preaching bible so I may give it as a gift it was a great deal just why Zondervan did you not choose a US printer we have a great one in Lillington Edward's Brothers with low overhead that would be glad to print your bibles. So its ok just doesn't seem the quality of my Thompson NIV Chain Reference its about worn out though interested in seeing what the 2011 NIV is about. thanks God bless."
5,NIV Large Print Thinline Ref,"This Bible has a nice, large, dark font. Very easy to read. The Bible is printed and bound in China, so it is a sewn binding of high quality. Too bad the American Bibles are such poorly made messes. This one has a nice, long, ribbon marker. The paper does not bleed through, so it seems ok to mark in it. I would certainly recommend this. It is quality. This is the traditional NIV of 1984 which remains the same, and is NOT that genderless, inclusive, politically-correct wonder, the TNIV.(Note 6-25-12) This Bible, like all of the 1984 NIV Bible, is no longer being printed. You should be able to get a copy on ebay or used book sellers. Since Zondervan has introduced the 2011 gender-inclusive NIV which used the TNIV as a base, thy have---in my humble opinion---mistakenly decided not to print the 1984 edition"
3,Still need my glasses,"Although I love this bible, I felt that the print was not large enough. I still need to wear my glasses."
3,large(?) print,"High quality binding. The translation is great. The weight is just right for carrying to church or holding while reading for long periods of time. The print, however, is not much larger than some of my other Bibles that are in standard print. I've seen those GIANT print Bibles and I don't need anything close to that size print but I would not have bought this particular one had I known how small the ""large"" print really is."
5,Awesome quality,"I bought this Bible a while ago. Bought a pair actually, one for me and one for my wife. 4 years later and we still got all the pages in them."
4,All that you need,A nice compact basic Bible. I was looking for something new that would be easy to carry around. This fits the bill. Nothing fancy but it is what is promises.
4,Nice,"I like the format of this one. The font size and spacing are just right. Even with a smaller font, it's comfortable and very readable. The bonded leather leaves much to be desired, but this not the manufacturer's fault; it's just the nature of bonded leather - stiff and inflexible on colder days. The pages open in sections due to the way the binding is sewn. Nonetheless, it's a great size and comfortable format."
5,Could be their finest album,"Like the Meat Puppets, Buffalo Tom makes a three-piece rock band sound vivid and relevant, never boring and much greater than the sum of its parts. Listen to the rhythm work in ""Caress"". Simple, yet top notch and clever. The title track and ""Guy Who Is Me"" are solid rockers.""Birdbrain"" is a quantum leap from their first, somewhat monchromatic, self-titled disc. Janovitz is a hell of a songwriter, even if he's not a guitar hero (witness any distorted, feedbacked-laden freakout on this album or ""Let Me Come Over""... nothing to write home about). His writing will get even better with ""Let Me Come Over""."
5,One of Jamaica's very best,"Justin Hinds is one of the all-time greats of Jamaican music, but has remained unfairly obscure for many years. It's nice to see all these great songs come out on CD. You can never go wrong with this artist if you have any love at all for the earlier ska and rocksteady music of Jamaica. A better songwriter and singer would be hard to find, he is a unique voice and spirit. Like Bob Marley, Justin Hinds started recording as a teenager around 1963 back in the days of ska, and has maintained his artistic integrity right up through the present time. Unlike Marley, who had more commercial aspirations, I don't think Justin Hinds ever made a bad record. Certainly everything on this set is worthwhile, as is the other CD on Trojan, ""Ska Uprising"". His his later work in the 70s for reggae producer Jack Ruby is also crucial listening. Justin is still around and occasionally tours, if you ever get the chance to see him in person I highly recommend it."
2,Great watch until you have to change the battery,"I received this watch as a gift and it was great for about a year. However, when the time came to change the battery it was impossible to get the back onto the watch again. I have taken it to a Kenneth Cole dealer (Macys), to a jewelry store and even to a watch repair shop; no one can get the back of the watch back on.An internet search revealed that I am not the only one with this problem. All suggested solutions (some quite severe) have availed nothing... disappointed ... I really liked this watch."
3,"Good, but outdated.","This book is outdated and also the author is a bit of a bragger about his collection and experiences in the book collecting world. It does, however, have some good rudimentary knowledge for a beginning book collector (not much use I would say to a seasoned collector)."
3,This book is old.,"The copyright date on this book is 1980. That's right, over twenty years old and the title says modern. The book is sorely in the need of an update. I was disappointed in lack of recent infomation dealing with the internet. It is a good source on basic book info, however. I would recommend looking elsewhere for anyone interested in this subject."
3,It is helpful,"The most usefull information that I got from this book, is the listing of publishers and identifing first editions. Some are quite detailed."
4,Outdated but very useful,"The information in the book is a little aged, but it is still applicable and useful. This book will remain in my reference collection."
5,Team First Team Last,"I brought Mark Craver's newest book home intending to spend a leisurely afternoon on the couch reading. Instead, my wife picked it up and started. She had things to do and places to go, but kept turning the pages. She smiled and sighed and got tears in her eyes during the whole book, which she described as being so engaging she couldn't put it down. She read it in one sitting, as did I the next morning.Anyone who played sports in high school, or was even remotely involved in their high school experience will enjoy this one."
4,A great reference and resource guide for artists,"If any artists are exploring reference material on shape, form anddesign in nature, this book explains why nature does 'create' it'sunique self.It does tend to explain and breakdown natural shapes into mathematicalequations and theorims. Still the photos they provide andthe line drawings help you to understand why things are theway they are. Useful if you want to create hybrids of theseforms. A intelligent imagination is useful.My applications for this are from a 3D fine arts point ofview. The info in the book has provided me with inspirationin my 3D artwork.SincerelyAndre Ribuolidreko@aol.com"
5,Rock 'n Roll will live forever!,"A rare CD to fill out my music collection. I have an almost complete collection of pop and rock and roll music from the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. This CD filled one of the few holes in my collection. Happy to get it; still shrink-wrapped and in pristine condition."
5,"Similar to ""Light Blue"" just for much less :)","This is a great product.If you wear it one day, you'll smell it on your clothes for other 2 days.Fast shipping. Everything you can expect."
4,Love the bottle!,I Love Love For Women. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4 OuncesSo glad this is available through Amazon -- it's not in most stores any more and I love it!
5,I Love Love by Moschino,i have been using this product for about three years- it replaced another fragrance that I used to use.(Dolce Gabbanna- Light Blue) The fragrances are sosimilar that I have been asked if the fragrance was the former that I used.Can't beat the price- it is more than half of the original fragrance and I absolutely love it and get many compliments. It is a light pleasing fragrance.
1,My favorite perfume,"I cannot believe how tiny this is.. It's half the size of my finger. Probably will only get only 5 uses out of it. What a joke. SAVE YOUR MONEY EVERYONE,"
5,"I love, I love love scent","I really do love this perfume! I received so many compliments when I wear this perfume. I like to spray it directly on my skin. It is very citrusy but it has this real tame woodsy scent in the background. So hard to describe but it's now my signature scent. :) I wear it wherever I go, not just the summer time like most people. You have to try it for yourself. And I heard a lot of people describe closest as Dolce's Light Blue. I can agree with them on that but I think I love love lasts longer and had a lighter scent."
5,Awsome,This is the best fragrance it wakes up your senses it is for thoes who are livly at heart once you smell it you'll be in love with I Love Love
5,Inspired,"The only explanation that I can think of for there beingonly 1 review (now 2) of this amazing album is that Snatam Kaurmust be the best-kept secret in the universe. She's that good!Prem is much more than Kundalini Chant. It's that, but much more.It will touch you on many levels. Snatam is an inspired artistand a mega-talent.Give her a chance, you'll get hooked!"
2,Overpriced Album,"Whoever priced this product had their pockets lined with dollar signs. Kaur is my newest favorite singer. Based on her past work, I decided to pay what I thought was a rather high price for the Prem album. The sound is commercial and redundent. Not the ethereal quality I have come to expect from Snatam Kaur."
4,"This packet arrived safe, sound and quickly","This CD arrived to Madrid from the US very quickly, in a bit more than a week, that's great! However, the previous item that I ordered never arrived, and I never received an answer neither from Amazon not from the seller.Thanks anyway,Manuel"
3,Not my first choice,"I did not like this CD as well as ""Shanti"" and ""Grace."" The production was much less rich, more simple. You may like that, but I did not find it as engaging or wide and spacious as the other two CDs I have. I do encourage you to give Kaur a try. Her music is inspiring."
5,Everything I Expected It To Be!,"I was counting down the days until this book was released. I went to my local bookstore Tuesday and after I couldn't find it on the floor, I lined up at the guest relations desk to see where it was located. As I approached the desk I spotted 2 boxes on the floor that read ""Jennifer Weiner - Little Earthquakes"". I begged the salesperson to let me buy one before they put them out and he did. As I walked away the 2 women that were behind me in the line were also lined up waiting for it!Jennifer Weiner is the best author in the world, in my humble opinion. I love each of her books and can't recommend them highly enough. I hope she writes many, many more and when she does I'll be standing in line on the day they're released, begging the salesperson to sale me one from the box.Go buy her books, everyone. You won't be sorry!"
4,"Enjoyable, effortless read",I love Jennifer Weiner's books because they are so well written and engrossing. I didn't want to put down the book. I was engrossed in the developing friendships. When the book ended I wanted more.
3,A little slow,"This was a story about a group of women and their babies. I found it slow at times, but worth the read. Just don't expect much excitement."
4,1st and last time I order,Never received book. I am getting a refund. read the small print. States it will ship in 24 hours but the fine print states 2-21 days. I needed it for a book club and ended up reading a friends book. The book is great.
2,Perhaps of interest mainly to those in the Mommy Club,"This book disappointed me because I'm a big Jennifer Weiner fan. I guess it's because I'm not part of the Mommy set that this book didn't appeal to me.The writing and story are interesting enough, although at points the transitions between characters (some which are cliches, like the interfering mother-in-law) seemed a little awkward. I liked Weiner's other books much better because they were more original."
5,Amazing Book...,"This book is the best book I think I've ever read. Maybe a few years ago I wouldn't have been able to appreciate it as much, but since I am now a mother of a 17 month old daughter, I could really get into all of the characters in this book. Each character; Becky, Kelly, Ayinde, Lia, were so well developed and their storylines were each different yet they could each understand what the other was going through. Each of the women dealt with different things; a bad family life, a husband who was famous and got another woman pregnant, a psycho mother-in-law and the loss of a child, and they all got through it. It was very inspiring. For any woman who is a mother, read this book."
3,Mediocre Story - Very Encapsulated,"I say capsulated because it was like the author sat down.. drew four columns out a piece of paper.. put the women characters' names at the top and then drew problems out of a hat and assigned them.There wasn't much cohesion between the women and the problems they dealt with had minimal overlap. It was like a case study of problematic motherhood scenarios.Then, predictably, all the ends are tied up neatly and logically at the end.. and the book ends. The book was far too linear and far too planned out for my tastes. It was an engrossing read but I wouldn't call this book 'great'. Three stars describes it appropriately in my opinion."
2,Only marginally more interesting...,"Than an afternoon spent with any of my new-mom friends. What worked so well with her previous novels - the depth and complexity of relationships, the interesting and orignal elements of the plots, are completely missing here. It was a huge disappointment and I hope that Ms. Weiner's future books return to her roots - which were so promising.If I want to spend hours being a sounding board to a new mother with mixed feelings about her new role as nuturer/provider, there are any # of friends of mine I can call. But frankly, I'd rather put on some cute slingbacks and get my flirt on in a bar."
5,A Great Comfort Read,"Just like there are comfort foods, so too are there comfort books and this is one of them! Such a great story of friendship, motherhood, sisterhood, marriage, and life. Totally enjoyable, loveable, and such a quick read! I loved all of the characters and identified with each of them in several different ways. Becky and her nightmare mother-in-law, Kelly and her need for perfection, Ayinde and her rocky marriage, and Lia with her unimaginable loss. Each of these women were lovable and easy to relate to. Buy this book and lend it to all of your girlfriends."
5,"Loved it as a mindless, entertaining read!","I love all of Jennifer Weiner books, not because they are great works of literature, but because they are filled with quirky, entertaining characters who find themselves in interesting situations. Also, I like the friendships that are formed. Not every book needs to stretch our intelligence, or challenge us. I don't mean this in a negative way, I am just responding to some of the reviewers who must think that they are above books like these. Why do they attempt them then?"
3,It didn't meet my expectations,"I was really looking forward to reading this book. I work at a bookstore, and it came highly recommended. But when I read it, I thought it was drab, and just not very strong writing. It didn't pull me in very well. The problems are borderline cliche--dead baby, cheating husband, troublesome mother in law. It was okay, just not INCREDIBLE."
2,Not thrilled,"I got through the book, continually hoping for it to acknowledge the joy of motherhood. The joy was there occasionally, but it was too deeply buried in the hard parts of being a Mom. Plus, out of 5 husbands, 4 had issues. Where is the balance? This is not how I'd recount my children's early days, or the message I'd want to share with young women."
3,"It was ""ok""...","This was an ""ok"" book. I kind of found myself getting confused because it switches back and forth between the different characters often. I also found it to be a slightly depressing storyline at times. It was an ""ok"" book, but I would probably only recommend it if you didn't have anything better to read."
3,Ehh...,"This was a cute book all about babies - definitely more in the ""Mom Lit"" genre than the ""Chick Lit"" genre. It was entertaining and a pretty fast/light read. I still think that her first book,Good in Bed, was her best (it was at certainly the one that I enjoyed the most!). Truly, my major complaint about this was more about how poorly Weiner was able to stick to the the P.O.V. her chapter headings indicated. That constant frustration aside, I doubt this will be the last of her books that I pick up - they are mindless, and just entertaining enough to be bearable."
5,Great Story!,"This is a perfect book to read by the pool, before bed, at the beach, or anywhere. Jennifer Weiner is a fabulous author!"
3,Chic Lit,"What a great fluff book....easy, light, summer reading.. So far all her books are fun........"
3,Little Earthquakes : A Novel,"I loved, loved, loved Jennifer Weiner's first two books - I couldn't put them down and coudn't wait for the next one to arrive. Coincidently I am expecting my first, so I thought this would be right up my alley - NOT. I have LOTS of mommy friends - and mommies to be - so it wasn't that I couldn't relate. It's just that maybe I could relate all too well. This book didn't make me laugh out loud like her first two books, rather, it made me feel like I was on the phone with my mommy friends (so why not just call them up?). I couldn't wait for this book to end. It was a disappointment. That said, I could not resist buying it again because her first two were that good - please come back with more Jennifer!"
1,a letdown,"I really enjoyed Jennifer Weiner's other two books, so I was looking forward to reading this one. What a letdown. I found all of the characters to be very one dimensional and whiny. Kelly was materialistic and her inability to talk to her husband was frustrating. Ayinde also seemed to lack the ability to talk to her husband and didn't seem to act like the strong woman her character was supposed to be. I felt for Lia's pain about losing her baby, but found her stalking a bit creepy. Becky, the most likable charchter of the book turned into a wimp when dealing with her mother in law and also made too many rules about her daughter. No boys and no tv for a baby? Get a grip! I had to stop reading many times just because the characters had become too annoying to continue!"
5,New moms will love this book,"I finished Jennifer Weiner's newest book, the Next Best Thing a few weeks ago and decided to revisit one of my favorites, Little Earthquakes on audiobooks. It's a toss up for me between Good in Bed and Little Earthquakes for which is my favorite of her books. Little Earthquakes never fails to make me cry (especially at the very end) and I'm always astonished anew at how natural and true the characters and their situations are. The overbearing mother in law is a little cartoonish, but the sense of a struggle for control between daughter in law and mother in law is very real and something indeed I've experienced. The great thing about this book is how it mixes sadness and humor together and how it manages to portray early motherhood in a very real and honest way. Love this book, love Jennifer Weiner."
4,The ending was lacking,"Little Earthquakes was a very compelling read even for someone who doesn't have children. It was great to see the different relationship dynamics and the mysteries surrounding some of the characters. That being said, the ending was less than desirable and literally left me asking, Seriously that's how this ends. It was quite disappointing how it ended, there were just so much left unanswered that it almost undid the rest of the book."
4,simply wonderful,"Jennifer Weiner's latest novel is a great read. Whether you are a new mom, a been-there-done-that mom, or even if you are not yet nor do you plan on being a mom, you will truly enjoy this book. It's not just about moms, but about three women who become fast friends and share the happy and sometimes the sad times with one another. When you are done reading, you will feel like you know these women and wish that you could become part of their circle of friends."
3,Mixed feelings / Highly overrated,"I'd give it 2 1/2 stars. Somewhat enjoyable light (ultra-LITE) reading material. However, I tend to agree more with the negative reviews here.It revolved way too much around the parenting of a new baby (boring for the parent of a teen). The relationships between husbands & wives were very cliche-ish. And what was up with the all the brand name-dropping and pop culture references?! -- VERY annoying.Anyway, if you love chick-lit & are pregnant/new mommy then read and enjoy! I felt the story would make a great Lifetime TV movie."
2,Not uplifting,I usually enjoy Jennifer Weiner books and even after reading some of the more negative reviews I decided to purchase this book as a nice read to unwind with after a long semester of law school. I was severely disappointed. The characters continuously complained about raising children- it was one big b!tch fest with an ending that left something to be desired. I would not recommend this book unless you are looking to feel better about how disappointed you are with the experience of having a child. If you want something fun and uplifting read Emily Giffin.
3,Good short story,Good book with interesting characters. Short book for a small price - a good buy. Kept my attention and made me care for the characters.
2,Better for pregnant 20-somethings,"This book may be of interest to a younger audience. I'm no longer interested all the gory details of pregnancy, labor, and the difficulties of living with a newborn. The plot didn't carry me along at all."
3,"Funny, Touching, Sad...A Plethora of Emotions!","I found this book to be an enjoyable read! It helped get me through a very boring and long train ride! It's a story that's touching, funny, uplifting and melancholly all at the same time. Best of all, it puts the category of empty-headed ""chick lit"" to shame! The book isn't heavy, but it's not fluff either! A great read!"
3,Slow start.....good middle...good end,"The more I read this book, the harder it was to put down. Weiner is an excellent writer that afforded me many a chuckle during this book. No, if you're not a parent or beyond the baby/toddler phases....it would still be a quick enjoyable read but not much more. But for those of us that still clearly remember pregnancy and the crazy months following, you will laugh at these woman and you will enjoy this book."
4,Pretty good,"This book is engaging from the first page. Great for new mothers, or older mothers who can look back and laugh. Good beach read. I look forward to reading more of Jennifer Weiner's books."
1,how did this even get published?,"I have enjoyed Weiners first two books and did listen to an unabridged CD (on 12 cds). Well not quiet all 12, by the 11th I could take no more. This, as story telling goes ranks right up with Danielle Steele. All four women are frustrating idiots whom you would like to strangle or put over your knee. I found myself shouting at the CD! They were pitiful stereotypes, some even borrowing modern day scandal. Most events were catastrophized and never really brought to successful conclusions. Only Becky was mildly enjoyable and believable, yet even she continued to let her husband put his mother before her and their marriage at every turn. Kelly has a mental illness as well as being the most shallow woman in history and Lea is most self centered and immature. Stay away from this one. I'll think about trying her next book but doubt it.Tonya Liodos"
3,Had it's moments,"After reading Goodnight Nobody, I thought this writer could do better. She did, just barely. This was an okay book, if only for the part about the mother-in-law. That part was hilarious, the rest was only sort of interesting. I will not be passing this one on to friends the way I do with all my other books."
3,Like eating laffy taffy,"I read this while I was preggo and thought it was fun, a bit unrealistic... at least for me, but fun like eating laffy taffy and listening to spice girls or j timberlake."
1,Waste of my time,I find this book extremely irritating. It seems contrived - like the author is striving to make the characters 'normal' and in reality who has a group of friends that includes a stunning newsreader with a famous husband and a hollywood actress. I don't get it!
2,Highly overrated,"This book had great potential and at first I couldn't put it down. Unfortunately, the characters never developed and by the end I was sick and tired of their whining. The characters were very stereotypical and while much was made of the trials of motherhood, the author never really showed us the joys that make it all worthwhile. I'm a working mom who's also experienced the pain of losing a baby and I was extremely disappointed in the storyline for Lia. There was a better story there than the one that was written."
1,no tremor,"I couldn't even finish this novel, which was poorly written and devoid of charm and interest. Jennifer Weiner is capable of much better, as her other novels prove. I think that she wrote this when she was sleep-deprived, in the months following the birth of her first baby, and her editor was on auto-pilot."
2,Not worth reading,"Unless you are an avid reader, and you are like me and your reading time is limited, I'd say don't bother this one. I was looking for a good chick lit type summer read, and a new mom myself thought this one looked good. I'm surprised at all the good reviews, etc. In my opinion this one just isn't that great."
4,Well written but depressing,"As my title states, this was a very interesting story and very well written. However, as someone who has not had kids yet, I found it also to be a very depressing view of motherhood and really makes me think more than twice about having kids. None of the characters had anything good to say about motherhood, other than that they loved thier children. It was depressing!!!!"
1,"Boring, Depressing","Maybe it has to do with the fact that I am not a mother but a 25 year old trying to get on her feet, but I did not find this book to have many redeeming qualities. The characters were stereotypical, predictable, and tiring. The only half-way memorable one is Becky. There is no plot besides ""let's see how miserable we can make motherhood out to be."" After reading this book, I am put off by the idea of becoming a mother. Like I said, maybe you have to be a mother to enjoy - that's the only reason I can come up with for other numerous rave reviews."
2,Not as Good as Others,"If you have just had a child or are about to, then this it he chick-lit for you.The whole of this story revolves strongly around child baring and birthing. So, much so that the characters are over shadowed by it to the point that if you aren't actually experiencing this in your own life, you will probably not like the book. Just because you are going through something in your personal life doesn't mean that the general population wants to read about it.Little Earthquakes is as the title suggests. Nothing special and wont shake your world or even move you."
3,just okay,"This book was just okay. I didn't find the characters all that believable. If you are looking for run-of-the-mill chic lit, you will probably not be too disappointed. I would probably recommend The Other Woman by Jane Green as a better version of this book."
3,Very upsetting storyline,"The general idea for this book was good - exploration of new motherhood from four different viewpoints. However, I do not recommend this book for very new moms, expecially those who have had rough pregnancies. The storyline about the mother who lost her baby was almost unbearable to read and left me feeling terrible (and sent me running to check on my prematurely born infant even more than I already do). I think the book could have been very good and memorable without a charachter who had lost a baby."
1,Not a good book,"I really did not enjoy this book at all. I think it was poorly written, contrived and unrealistic, very difficult to finish it. This was the first time I read a book by this author and probably the last."
1,Like reading an article in People magazine,"I really have enjoyed Ms. Weiner's books, and I volunteer at a library, so I thought I'd try this. The author is usually charming, witty and perceptive. I felt the author was similar to her characters-in need of a nap. Wow- I felt that if this was her first book, I never would have returned-we have all read those books! Who would publish such a lackluster book?Repetition- did she think her readers were too drowsy to remember what she'd told us two chapters earlier.I know this book was written quite a while ago, but has left such a bad taste in my mouth , that I am hesitant to pick up Ms. Weiner's future books."
3,I wanted to really like it,"I tried very hard to like this book - and it was a pretty easy read. However, I really didn't care for any of the characters. Lia is basically a stalker with a sad story. Becky is a larger than life character that refuses to stand up to her mother in law. Kelly is a perfectionist micromanager that doesn't realize her world is crumbling and the other girl I spent most of the time trying to say her name. I understand she is exotic - but how about a name I don't have to phonetically read?I can't believe the characters bonded so tightly after just one yoga class. Do they not have any other friends? And they all just love each other - no disagreements, catty backstabing - anything. I think Becky wants to make fun of the exotic one for following certain guidelines - but that never develops.I guess this would be a great book if it were your first baby."
5,Fantastic,"Jennifer Weiner's rich, witty, true-to-life ""New York Times"" bestselling novel tells the story of three very different women as they navigate one of life's most wonderful and perilous transitions: the journey of new motherhood. From prenatal yoga to postbirth sex, ""Little Earthquakes"" is a frank, funny, fiercely perceptive take on the comedies and tragedies of love and marriage."
4,Feel Good Book,"I read this novel before I decided to start my own family, but now that I have children of my own, I can totally relate to the main character. It was beautifully written, fast-paced, and enjoyable all around."
5,Great Book,"Didn't want to put it down. It goes through the lives of 4 new moms and the different struggles they face. It was funny, suspenseful, dramatic. It's a great read."
3,I love it but..,"I really love Jennifer Weiner's previous books. She's witty and really funny. What I love most about her books is she can really make you cry and at the same time make you smile. I finished reading in her shoes in one go. But this new book really takes a new twist. Maybe because I am still single and not a mommy that I can't really relate to the stories. Plus, there seems to be a lot of characters that makes the book feels very ""crowded"". Too much pregnancy details that makes me feel like reading lifetime documentary. I skipped most of the pages."
1,Couldn't wait to finish this book and get it over with,"One-dimensional, stereotypical characters. Too many pop culture references used for description--if you don't know the reference, the description means nothing. I didn't think the dialogue was realistic either. And many of the women in the book were just whiners.I agree with another reviewer in that seems to view new parenthood as something that makes the Earth shift--causes little earthquakes--as a bad thing. Maybe the author had this experience and other Moms feel overwhelmed but I thought it was a bit overstated. The women's relationship seemed forced too. Put this in the same category as a bad Movie of the Week on TV.I couldn't wait to get to the last CD of this audiobook. . .and move on to a better book."
2,A little disappointed...,"I read Good In Bed and In Her Shoes, and loved them both. The thing that stood out to me the most was how relatable Jennifer Weiner's characters were. She managed to grab your interest while increasing your sympathy for everyone. I was looking forward to Little Earthquakes, but found the book falling short. No character really stood out to me, the story ended up being a snooze fest and I almost ended up in sugar shock with all the unecessary sappiness. After forcing myself to finish it, I was left with an overwhelming sense of ""who cares?"" Not her best."
5,Bbc nature,"It's amazing, the video it great, narrating is great! Surprising that it came in one piece, that the only thing I'm always worried about when I order movies from amazon"
5,Stress-relieving unspoilt living treasure,"After watching the TV documentary first time, I felt a relaxing heaven-like peaceful feeling as my imagination exploded with images and sounds of weird animals and plants that transported me to another planet, that's like the scifi movie Avatar, except no profit-hungry mining or timber industry would touch this place, as if there's some kind of curse of death if human greed interfered it's natural unspoilt living treasure of wildlife that only exists in Madagascar. Not to be confused with the funny cartoon animal personalites of the human voice actors in the cartoon movie Madagascar, the real-life animal personalities in the documentary show their surviving habits and noise-making voices, where jerking arm and leg movements to stay alert at all times are common for many types of ground and tree-living animals. Much more than a DVD documentary, it can relieve stress from my busy job as a labourer::"
3,David should stay out of picture,"We, for most part, liked Life & Planet Earth series. We did not like that David makes references to birth of Christ (like he knows when he was born :) or his pro Darwin-istic delusions (I guess he believes in Christ & in turning from monkey to human :), too bad this will prevent me showing this to my children, may be I can delete his commentaries) so we bought this series. Unfortunately, David adds another invention to previous ones, he shows up on the screen & gives his ideas about evolution. Undoubtedly, good commentator, but should just stick to what he sees & keep his delusions to himself & please stay out of screen, We are willing to pay more if they cut out images with him & his pro-darwinistic commentaries."
1,"WASN'T as pictured - *all* red, picture is fixed now.","This item is not as pictured, and amazon rep's are clueless as to how I can actually get the item that's pictured. I kept asking ""How can I get a red cap with a blue bill?"" and they sent me 2 caps, *all* red! amazon will not fix their picture, nor will they answer my question. I have to go somewhere else to buy this cap. very disappointed.Update: It appears amazon fixed the picture."
1,Boston Red/Blue baseball cap,"Unfortunately, the above item was returned as the medium was to small for my husband, then when I returned back on line to re-order it did not show that this product could be ordered in a Large...I was very disappointed..."
3,Crime melodrama often retreads other formulas,"Two brothers, one a gambler and the other a steel factory accountant, are led by Miss Dors onto stealing the factory's money to cover up for a small amount of cash embezzled out so that one of them might take an expensive vacation with her. The irony is that a factory guard catches them and is killed. Guilt caused by the crime and an old man who witnesses it drives the accountant mad with fear and a final confession, but the old man who saw it was really blind! Diana Dors could play her part blind and in her sleep by now, but better films have something more sympathetic for a character she portrays."
4,Can't wait to use but.........,"My husband and I picked this bassinet out for several different reasons. The look was nice and modern, not lacy and out dated. It was nutural in color and Apeared to be made well. We bought the bassinet just the other day and as he was finishing putting it together he noticed that the screw holes were missing on one of the wooden arches. We were able to take this piece only back to the store and exchange it rather than taking the whole thing apart. My husband called the customer service line that was included in the directions but they were not much help. Just a word of advice, make sure all of the pieces are properly drilled before you start to assemble."
4,So far so good...,"We just bought this bassinet even though we aren't due until February. I love the look of it and once you figure out which screw is which it is fairly easy to get together. I think it took my husband and I about half an hour. It feels really solid and rolls around nicely. If you feel the need to iron the dust ruffle things, like I did, I would recommend doing this prior to assembly since you have to take the basket off of the stand to get the cover off. But it irons beautifully and looks great. Compared to all the ghastly plastic things we looked at this one is certainly the best looking. I can't wait to use it."
2,Not worth it!,"I chose this bassinet only because it is so beautiful! But I chose it for the wrong reason. This bassinet has a rocking feature but you must rock it your self, which can become extremely tiring. The music feature is hilarious...I never play it for my son. It is also extremely inconvenient at night to pick up the baby from the bed...I should have purchased a co-sleeper."
3,Serves its purpose ... but not my first choice,"We borrowed this from a relative to use as a secondary bassinet in our family room for our newborn. While it serves its purpose so our little one can be in the same room, it does severely lack in features. The music feature is poor quality, and does not have a timer. The rocking feature is manual. The mattress pad support is very poor, I recommend buying a rectangular bassinet pad/mattress for additional support. If you want a great bassinet loaded with features for the same price, I highly recommend The First Years Carry Me Near 5-in-1 Sleep System."
1,UNSAFE - Locking device DOES NOT work,"We bought this bassinet because we really liked the way it looked and it had excellent reviews. We did not realize that the cradle portion still rocked a good two inches to each side (when in the locked position) until we brought our daughter home from the hospital. She likes to roll onto her side and the first night that we put her in it, the fact that she moved to her side put it off balance and she rolled face first into the side of the bassinet. We returned the bassinet to the store and they accepted it back once we explained what had happened. This bassinet may be cute but it is not safe...especially if your newborn is very active."
2,The only ones sleeping in here are the cats!,"I loved this design because it matched our furniture, was sweet looking, but not girly, and was made well. The day we brought our son home, he would sleep anywhere but the bassinet. He'd sleep on the changing table of the pack-n-play with no trouble, but the bassinet would send him into hysterics. I think the fact that it never fully locked, and would continue to shift made him uneasy. As others have mentioned, cleaning this is a real pain. I have not even been able to figure out how to remove the fabric on the canopy to clean. My baby spent his 1st 3 months sleeping in his Papasan instead of the bassinet."
3,notsohappy,"I loved this bassinet and had to have it. I continued to love it for two weeks...then it started to wobble back and forth. I don't think it was made to roll around very much. I only push it from my living room to my bedroom once a day, however it seems to be falling apart already! I thought the bolts at the bottom just needed to be tightened, but the wood is actually cracking. As far as the sheets go, I have no idea what everyone is fussing about. You can buy regular bassinet sheets (made by Koala Baby) that fit perfectly!"
5,rtfm,"we just purchaced this basinette and it is very nice:) after reading previous reviews i believe people did not asemble it corectly ....the directions were not that hard to comprehend. It was a little tricky getting the rocking cam-bolts in, out side of that it is a very sturdy basinette Iam looking forward to putting my little one to sleep in it ......"
2,Poor customer service and difficult to obtain sheets!,"My mother bought this bassinet for us 4 months prior to my due date. When I assembled it, I noticed a piece of hardware missing. So I called customer service to get the missing part. They said they would have to send a whole new hardware pack and they were out of stock and would take 2-4 weeks. That was 6 weeks ago, and my baby is due in 1 week. I also ordered replacement sheets and they also were on backorder; I still have not received them after a month or more, and so I only have one sheet that I can use for the bassinet when my baby comes home from the hospital. It does NOT take standard bassinet sheets or crib sheets. I would not buy this product again because of these inconveniences!"
3,cute and small but needs inprovement,I bought this bassinet because i have a small bed room and had previously had bought one of the larger rocking bassinet and found it would require way to much space.and would fit better some where eles . anyway i did read the reviews that other people wrote . but thought the people where just making a big deal of nothing until i brought my new baby home and used it. to find out they were so right the about the wheels falling off all the time.and now having to always check at night after i move the bassinet over since i have it close to my bed.i have to move it over to get out of my bed and make sure the wheels haven'fallen off is a pain .because they fall off at least onece a time day .other wise if you don't have to move this bassinet around it those the job .the fact that you have to mannual push this to rock suck when your have asleep .is a pain too.i hope everyone else looking to buy baby stuff thinks twice before buying this item .
3,It Gets The Job Done With a Little Class,"The music is bad, and no it doesn't rock automatically, but this great looking EB bassinet get's the job done. My premature son didn't mind the padding or the canopy other reviews indicate. I appreciate the additional storage underneath so I dont have to leave the room for anything.If you're into the ""look"", as I was as a new mom and matching things, the Eddie Bauer Collection is one to be reckoned with and this bassinet - - get's the job done!"
3,Too Pricey,For the price of the item it's not worth it.It's completely old fashion and in this modernised world I shouldn't have to spend majority of my time rocking this bassinet.The storage below is perfect for her extras
3,New mom,"We received this as a gift and we love it. It's true - the music isn't the symphony - but what baby toy is. It's also true that this does not rock on it's own, which I thought was the case - but if your baby is crying you usually hold them to comfort them anyway. But aside from those 2 things this bassinet is great and looks great. We are able to roll our baby around the house while he's sleeping and never disturb him, and my husband & I switch who's side of the bed we put it on each night. Our baby is 4 months now and we hate the idea of leave him in another room away from us."
2,dont buy it,"I had choosen this bassinet because it was neutral and not too ""babyish"". It is cute to look at but thats about it. It does not rock automatically, so twisting in bed trying to rock it back and forth was torture (esp. if you had a c-sec). We had our baby swaddled alot in the beginning and she would roll to one side with her face smooshed against the padding. She would also freak when she was on her back and it would rock slightly-even though it was locked (I think she felt like she was falling-very common w/newborns)also, the music is super distorted and scratchy.Save your money!!!"
3,Nice but music is horrific and gets wobbly,"Our first baby liked it. We never used the music and it is basically useless to the point that it should not even be there. For us, the locking was never an issue and the assembly is easy if you know how to follow instructions.Biggest problem is that the unit needs much better leg support and gets wobbly with time especially if you roll it on carpet. Our first child was fine for it but I will probably have to add some metal support brackets on my own to use it with confidence for the second. For all the time and effort that went into this product, it is amazing that the most crucial element was under-enginered.Also note that while you are rolling the bassinet it is easy to accedentaly trip the wheel locking mechanism with your foot."
1,Good Night Sleep Tight Don't Let the Bed Bugs Bite,My sister was the recipient of the this bassinet. One day she saw a bug on the bedding. When she killed the bug alot of blood came out. When she lifted up the mattress she found a nest of bugs hiddden in the crevices of the bassinet. We had no idea that sleeping in the bassinet with my niece were bedbugs.We called BabiesRus and they were not suprised. They said that the bedbugs probally got into the shipping from the manufactuer. She asked for a refund and was told to call Eddie Bauer. Eddie Bauer said they would replace the bedding. Why would anyone in their right mind want a replacement?I just wanted the parents to be aware. Bedbugs do in fact bite. They feed off of blood. So be careful. Be very very careful.
2,just not worth it,I picked this bassinet for all the wrong reasons. It was pretty and looked sturdy. My daughter hated sleeping in it. I could never find sheets that fit it and the music stopped playing after a day.
2,Don't judge a book by its cover,"We fell in love with this bassinet the miniute we saw it. It's beautiful natural wood and mello colors... and lets face it , it's eddie bauer, it has to be quality! WRONG!My son hates this. The pad is so thin, I'm not sure why they even bother with it. The music option it awful. It sounds like when you have a blown speaker in your car but still turn up the radio as loud as it goes (or am I the only one who does that?)You have to rock it yourself. And locking it in place doesn't completely lock it, it still moves a bit.I finaly went out and got a different one and now my son sleeps a lot better ( we are still working on getting a full night of sleep!)I know that it's beautful, but consider a different option!"
3,7 months waiting for bassinet sheets,"I love the bassinet it was a shower gift i received it on Sept. 25th, 2004. I immediately order extra sheets the next day as a previous reviewer has advised. My baby was due on November 7th 2004 and arrived on Nov. 10th, however yesterday March 7th, 2005 I received a letter stating there would be a further delay of 6 to 8 weeks wait for the sheets I ordered nearly 6 months ago. This is an absolute disgrace and i would advise everyone to be prepared to sew your own sheets unless you are only in the planning stages of getting pregnant."
2,"Poor product, poor customer service","I was not going to purchase this bassinet after reading the poor customer reviews but ended up receiving it as a gift. I put it toghether and all was going well until the very end. One of the wooden ends was split in two. I called the manufacturer to have a replacement part sent to me. They informed me that this particular piece could not be replaced- they would have to send me an entirely new bassinet. Fine. But first they would have to send me paperwork to fill out to prove that the bassinet was in fact in unusable condition. Then I had to take it completely apart and ship it back to the company before they would send me a replacement!!! I had a fit and told them this was inexcusable and I would not go to such lengths for THEIR faulty product. I am still waiting and it's been weeks. Baby is almost here now so I probably won't get to use it and will end up with a broken bassinet. STAY AWAY FROM THIS ""B"" IS FOR BEAR LINE!"
4,"If plastic & frilly ruffles aren't for you, then this bassinet is!","I just finished assembling my bassinet and I am very pleased. It was very easy to put together. I would have given it 5 stars, but as mentioned the music is awful (that's okay, I can do without it) and the bassinet material is time consuming to remove for cleaning. Other than that it is just perfect. Since I'm having a boy, I bought light blue knit bassinet sheets from Carters. I put them on over top of the cover that came with the bassinet and they fit just perfect. I also put a thin piece of memory foam under the ""mattress"" for a little extra padding without compromising safety."
1,Don't buy it,"Besides the fact that it is too small, if your baby moves around a lot she wont get a comfortable night sleep. If you are going to have your baby sleep in your room for several months, just buy a pack and play the best one without question is the one by graco that costs 59.99 (Newport Bears), don't waste your money on anything else."
4,Just what I was looking for....,"This is a really great bassinet...for a boy or girl! It seemed like all the other bassinets were either too frilly for my baby boy, or too cheaply made. This one took care of both problems...it's very neutral in color(which matches just about anything) and it's a very simple, practical design. It's very sturdy and well made. It's also fairly easy to assemble...it took me an hour and a half to assemble it myself(at 7 months pregnant)and I didn't have any problems. The only thing I wish it had was a vibrating feature. I'd also recommend ironing it first because it does get very wrinkled."
1,"horrible, horrible customer service","I gave this bassinet a 1 star rating since the customer service at the company who manufactures this bassnet is simply horrible. I ordered sheets to fit the mattress 4 MONTHS AGO. they originally told me it would take 2-4 weeks. It is just outrageous. They keep telling me they will be here is about 1 week. Of course, this was many months ago. I keep calling and they have no explanation. Don't buy this product because the customer service is terrible. the number is 1-800-544-1198. Call and see for yourself."
2,Great Bassinet if you got the screws,"I chose this item and selected to be on my register. I received this bassinet for my newborn son three weeks after he was born. It was not mentioned in the description that shipping will take such a long time. In addition, when I set all the parts for bassinet to be built all the screws were missing. I called the manufacturer right away. They promised me that the screws will be here in 7-10 business days. My son is eight weeks now and I still have not recieved any screws. After speaking to manufacturer sales department I was told that the screws were backordered and that I will take another 10-14 days to received them. Hmmmm...At that time my son will be three months old and I will not be able to put him into bassinet for safety reasons..."
5,I love it!,"I absolutely love this bassinet. My husband put it together in no time. It moves easily from room to room. The mattress is very thin but I just bought a thicker mattress, and that solved the problem. The storage unit is very helpful. If you have to move the bassinet you still have everything you need right there.No complaints over here!!"
1,No one would sleep in it.,"Neither my neice, nephew, or daughter would sleep in this bassinet. They would all sleep anywhere, anytime, EXCEPT in the Eddie Bauer bassinet. Other cons: there is no way to keep the bassinet from rocking and the music box is terrible quality. Also, I couldn't find sheets to fit this matress anywhere."
1,"If you value your baby, do not buy",I bought this bassinet and had to return it because my daughter weighed over 9lbs at birth and her weight caused it to rock. This resulted in her face being up against the slats. We feared she would suffocate and had to be constantly moving her from against the sides. She got black and blue bruises on her cheeks from pressing her face against the sides.
1,Not worth 2 cents!!!!!,"This bassinet....doesn't rock, the screws fall out..it is unsafe...especially with little toddlers around, when they try to peek in at the baby the whole bassinets swings...NOT WORTH 2 CENTS (let alone $130.00)"
1,This product is unsafe!,"My sister purchased the bassinet for my son when he was newborn. I found him, more than once, in the middle of the night, having rolled into the corner of the bassinet with the cradle on a tilt and his face buried between the ""mattress"" which is not much of a mattress, and the side of the bassinet.Then I found that the screws that keep the bassinet attached to the frame unscrew after rocking for a while. More than once I have found the screws in the bassinet, which is a choking hazard, but the bassinet was also completely detached from the frame creating a fall hazard.This is a beautiful piece of baby furniture, but not worth the safety risks!"
1,IT'S SOOOO CUTE......... BUT DANGEROUS!!!,"OK.... Little babies have fits anywhere they lay.. especially when they are hungry and with my baby she pushes her self around in a cirlcle when she has a fit. Although, she sleeps right next to our bed one night she had a fit and her head got stuck on the little itty bitty bar on the side of her bassinet and she screamed so loud it was a mothers worse nightmare. I picked her up and felt the top of her head and it was dented in and I freaked out, it ended up a bump and thank god it went away... but if you still must buy this product after reading this I suggest you put thick cardboard in between the bar and the fabric.Ohh ya and to other reviews my baby was only 2 (two) months old when it happened and 21 that's (twenty-one inches) when it happened. My baby it just a very active baby. (smile)Keep your rude comments about other's babies to yourself. Thank you."
4,Must Have!!!!!,"I have read the reviews of others and I would have to disagree. I love this bassinet!!! My daughter is 3 months old. I registered for this bassinet after seeing it in the store. It was the nicest one there and I loved the wood. The storage area is great. I had a C-section, so having the storage area allowed me to store diapers, wipes, bisb, clothes, etc. for my daughter, and have everything right at my finger tips. The pad that comes with it is a bit thin. My mother-in-law purchased a separate bassinet pad, which then allowed me to use standard bassinet sheets. A standard bassinet mattress/pad does fit in the bassinet. When the bassinet is in the locked position it only swings maybe 1/2 inch if that! I never had a problem with it tilting as describe in on of the other reviews. The music is not great,but the music is great on any of the bassinets with that feature."
2,"Cute, but has problems. Choose a different bassinet!","I chose this bassinet b/c I liked a) the design (not too frilly, but still sweet), and b) the rocking option. I have been dissappointed with it. First, it does not rock automatically...you must push it. Second, the sheets situation is a problem. I ordered them (over the phone) six weeks before my baby was born. My baby is now FOUR MONTHS, and they still haven't arrived!!! Third, unless you want to train your baby to be tone-deaf, you will not want to use the music option. It sounds absolutely horrible. Very cheap. The music is distorted and out of tune."
1,"Looks Good, Works Terrible","My husband bought this because it matched our room but other than looking good, it is not worth the money. It does not rock by itself. The one and only sheet it comes with is more like vinal than cloth and the music is horrible. When I tried to contact their customer service with questions I couldn't get ahold of anyone. My suggestion is that you find a different bedding option."
1,waste of money,"I thought that this would have been a rocker that rocks itself, and it is not. This is too small, so you would not get too much use out of it. You are better off getting the pack and play. I used this for around 4 wks if that long, and had to put the baby in the bed until i got the pack and play. Totally waste of money."
3,Purchase a different BASSINET,"This is a very beautiful bassinet but I think it's very expensive, does not rock automatically, and the music sounds cheap and distorted. My newborn son does not like the tunes and dislikes sleeping in this pricey Eddie Bauer Bassinet. He's been sleeping in our bed. It's too bad, cause it's such a nice piece of furniture but poorly manufactured. ""Don't judge a book by it's cover"""
4,liked it,"The sheets are a problem finding them, so we just used a blanket. As far as the music it was very soothing to our baby and it sounded fine......we also loved the design, classic. We have packed it away and will be using it for baby #2. We liked the storage underneath the bassinet and would recommend it!!!"
3,PRETTY AND CONVENIENT BUT NOT SO STABLE,"It is gorgeous and the storage is great for my bedroom where I have the bassinet, however my little one wouldnt sleep in it. I wasn't sure why but the fact that her face gets smushed into the sides and she IS NOT a HUGE baby and 7lbs 7 ozs. My little one sleeps in her PAPASAN which costs a fraction of the bassinet. I really think it depends on the baby, luck of the draw."
5,"The best out there, the safest","My online reviews are pure and simple, it's to help parentes decide, the same way it helped me before. Actually, I did my baby registry based on customer reviews, 99% satisfied. Check out my other reviews. This bassinet is the best out there, safe. My daughter slept very good until she turned 6 months. Good luck"
3,"OK value for price, hard to assemble","I saw this at a friend's house and wanted to get it, too. This model has been discontinued and if you want to get a better price, just check out Marshalls around the corner, they are everywhere now. I like the look of the bassinet, the music though is terrible. Also, the rocking is rather hard to do, the material of the bassinet is very cheap and and according to my husband assembly was a major pain in the ... As I said, it is nice for the price we paid, but it surely is not a luxury item."
3,Contains half of a classic holiday album,"This CD contains about half of the tracks from the classic Living Strings instrumental album, THE SPIRIT OF CHRISTMAS. If only RCA would see fit to release the entire set!"
4,Yummy!,"SO many of the best films came out of the 70's and this is certainly one of them. Mobsters, sex slave trade, and most of all good ole' country cuisine make Prime Cut a real winner. The photography is beatiful, the direction very cunning, and the performances terrific. A real oddity in some ways, but a great twisted ride for those willing to take the chance on on older film."
4,Prime Cut,This is a great Lee Marvin classic with lots of pace. Script is excellent and Lee plays his part as the done wrong gangster to the hilt. As good as some of the Dirty Harry movies. Rent it before buying to be on the safe side?
3,Hard to find movies great,nice to have a method of getting old classics that have not been released on dvd. First R rated movie I saw as a kid. Had to sneak into theatre with false ID.
3,Truly gritty film,"The inescapable conclusion of the film is that it is contrasting midwestern 'rubes' with the 'mob' and showing that the 'mob' city slickers are the good guys. Lee Marvin is a well-spoken mob enforcer who's sent to collect on a debt owed by Gene Hackman. Hackman plays a totally amoral beast who sells 'meat', be it in the form of cattle or human beings. Sissy Spacek has a very odd role as one of the 'slaves' who is liberated by Lee Marvin. It is very odd and disturbing. In the end, you start rooting for neither side in this visceral film.I am a Lee Marvin devotee and have seen all his work. This film is as hard to watch as 'Hell in the Pacific' but at least that had historical moment and importance. This film is a simple rumble with one side bad (the mob) and one side much worse (the midwest merchants of almost anything objectionable.)"
3,A guilty Pleasure,"I have always liked Gene Hackman (real different role for him) and Lee Marvin. Simple plot, Mobster is skimming money, enforcer is sent by mob boss to get it back. Unreal situations from start to finish. However, if you are looking for 70's style B movie with gangster type action, give Prime Cut a try. I enjoyed it and it is one of my guilty pleasures, for action type shows. The DVD itself wasn't the greatest quality, but it had been 30 years since I had seen it in the theater, so the quality may not have been that good to begin with. The movie's quality is still good enough to watch."
4,How to tell if Lee Marvin had been drinking.,"I bought this movie and loved it for the sheer wierdness of seeing three academy award winning actors in a movie about meat grinding humans and drugged runaways sold as sex slaves. I noticed if Lee doesn't have much to say in a scene his upper lip hangs down on his face. You can see it for the first time in ""The Killers"" where he intentionally got totally drunk before his dying hitman character kills Ron Reagan. As his career progresses, his scenes where his character isn't doing much you can see the hanging upper lip. You can also see it The Professionals. In the opening scenes of this movie where the mob boss is laying down the mission to Lee it can be seen again."
2,Fast forward review,"This is kinda mainstream for a review based on sleaze points, but hey, even Frenzy gets a point for the strangling scene. Anyway, in spite of the big time actors you can forget the plot which involves white slavery and some other stuff, who cares.We got two scenes here worth a snip. The first is a county fair style hog contest, only with mobsters replacing the 4-H'rs and drugged out nubile starlets replacing the pork. Oh, did I mention they're nekkid? Straw pens and everything. I'm not going to speculate what the straw is for.The main draw is an extended scene with Sissy Spacek showing her Janet Jackson's, mainly beneath a see-through dress that Lee (unaccountably) takes her out to dinner in. OK, Ms. Spacek has showed them before, or rather after, but they never looked better than this, a real pervy lolly type feel.That's it, one and half stars for the nudity, and a 1/2 star bonus for the FBF (famous bosom factor)."
1,Bizzare Rip Off,"What rubbish. Ridiculous situations, and poor writing doom this boring, stupid film. Probably, the worst film that starred either Lee Marvin or Gene Hackman. A real hack job that was meant to snare unsuspecting theater goers who liked the stars."
4,Nice Bowls,"The Crisa Moderno line by Libbey Glass is a durable,clean lined, clear glass and difficult to break line of dishes. Food looks so nice in clear glass, especially pasta, fruit and salads. This bowl makes a nice pasta and side dish soup bowl, but it is not a great salad bowl, too small for my green mixed salads! I love the 6"" cereal bowls for a salad though, since I bought both bowls, it works perfectly."
3,Not microwave safe,These are great as tableware for the price but I used one in the microwave to warm up some carrots in water for my granddaughter and it broke in half.
3,soup bowls for bridal shower,"I have beautiful Lenox dish settings for 12 and my daughter was getting married. So we decided to have a bridal shower using my elegant dishes. However, as our menu included soup and I have only 2 soup bowls, I did not know what to do because I couldn't afford a $50 per bowl price tag for a party. My mother mentioned glass soup bowls and after checking on Google, I found Amazon.com were selling a dozen elegant glass soup bowls for a mere $20.00! The soup bowls arrived in time for the luncheon and complemented my Lenox dishes. Thank you Amazon.com!"
1,"NOT made in america, NOT microwave safe","seems like those plates are not made in america which was the actual selling point for me - or at least the set i received was made in mexico. over a period of 4 months now 3 plates already broke in the microwave, from clean cut in half to messy little pieces, after heating stuff for 2 minutes or so. 1 plate got chipped while unloading the dishwasher. now i'm almost afraid to use them at all. regarding those stickers on each plate that people commenting about. i pulled them super slowly and they come off very well."
3,Not microwave safe,"Not quite what I was looking for. A little too shallow, making in-bowl mixing a somewhat messy, and definitely NOT microwave safe. Ok for serving salads and soups, but you take a risk if you like to store and reheat in this bowl."
2,Returned bowls not made in USA,"After finally receiving this 6-piece set, I returned it after looking at the box and found that this is not made in the USA, although other reviews and research state so. I, and one, should be sure that the item sent is actually the item expected, but I took a chance. I've purchased other items with the Libbey label and all are marked USA. So, big disappointment here and returned to Amazon."
1,Not made in USA. Hecho en Mexico.,"I bought these bowls because other reviewers received dishes that were made in the USA. All of the items I received (I ordered bowls and plates) were from a company called Crisa and were labeled ""Hecho en Mexico."" I tried to call the company to ask about the lead issue but could not find a web site. It looks like Crisa is now a division of Libbey. I called Libbey several times but got a recording that then disconnects you. Disappointing. Will be returning."
2,Oh look.... another chip.,"We bought these bowls six months ago, and I have to say that I've never experienced this type of wear and tear on any of my other dishes - ever.These were bought for our office kitchen as a way to be more conservative with paper. They get hand-washed, rarely (if ever) see the inside of a microwave, and don't consistently get used on a daily basis since it's a small office. So far, at least half the bowls have one or two chips along the edges, creating a convenient way to slice open your fingers.We're not rough, careless people, and no one is thrashing these around... they're just either cheap or poorly designed. Not only that, but they can barely contain a serving of soup. If I had it to do over again, I wouldn't have bought these."
4,Educational and loving,"As several others have noted, this book takes a very different LOVING approach. I recommend it for education on beliefs, as well as the knowledge and understanding of the tremendous difficulty in one leaving the culture and life of the LDS church. Great book for teaching others on LDS and evangelizing."
4,evangelical Christian,This book gives me a different method of sharing my faith in Jesus in a nonjudgemental manner that starts others to think for themselves.
5,"Practical, inspiring","A friend has experienced a horrible loss. Are you like me? You want so much to be an encouragement, but you don't know what to say or what to do. ""Mourning into Dancing"" explores all types of loss and the accompanying grief. Part 2 is extremely practical in helping someone deal with the grief that comes from death."
5,An actor supports All The Words on Stage,"""All the words on stage"" is one of the most helpful, useful, and practical self-help books for actors that I have read. The key to acting shakepeare is of course in the words- and if you can pronounce them and scan them as they were meant to be, the world of the play can come alive. This book is so well organized and researched that reading the plays is so much more rewarding. The book is not of overwhelming size, but it seems to have emphasized most every important word. It is not every word, but the man wrote over twenty full length plays, for crying out loud! Now if I could only know what the words all MEAN. . ."
2,Overproducing Domingo,"Found this in a sale bin. Listening to Placido Domingo has always been a pleasure for me, so when I saw that he sings on all but three of the tracks,I thought that it was a safe bet.For once the great voice is lost in a surfeit of overproduction. Domingo's voice is pumped up electronically as if that were even faintly necessary, and the orchestrations are loud and annoying.Looking at the stills from the film (TV show?) which I have never seen, in the booklet, I can't help but wonder what any of this loud modern pop music has to do with the elegant costuming and reconstruction of 19th century life.This is bad !!!"
2,Alborada - Placido's or Soap Opera Soundtrack?,"Totally disapointed, the novela has stunning and beautiful melodies that are not included in this CD (I'm so mad), what is doing the others Placido's songs in this CD anyways? Jorge Avendaño should have included the other songs used in the novela, since the Antonio's and Juana's melodies to the songs used by the lady that sung in the castle's parties."
2,A HOT MESS,"The cord does not retract anymore, so it has totally lost its ""cool factor"" feature which was the ability to reduce the cumbersome lengthy cord. in addition, the cord on this version does not appear to be as sturdy/durable as the ones that have the black casing."
1,afp01,"I have read the two other novels in this trilogy by another translator. They were superior and more exciting I could not put them down. This book translated by Jeremiah Curtin is absolutely terrible, I can't force myself to read it. I can not recommend this translation of a terrific trilogy."
2,Poor Quality,"I was disappointed with the quality of this end table. The shelves are very thin and flimsy and will not take much weight. Also, this end table will not last very long - while putting it together the legs started to crack."
1,It was too hard to assemble.,"THe pieces did not fit together properly. And, the screw holes were not deep enough. I still have screws sticking out even after using a drill."
3,you get what you pay for,"This item feels very thin and flimsy. I had to exchange the item because the first one had broken in shipping, the shipping was very fast and easy but I shouldn't have had to do it in the first place. Once I got the second one, when I started putting it together and some of the screw holes were not clear enough so it did not assemble very easily. I'm keeping it because I like the shelf and the cabinet. I bought it because it was inexpensive but it is because the product is cheap. Hopefully it will last."
2,table,"I was excited when I received this table. I was the exact height and color I wanted. Assmebly was easy until I realized that the manufacturer made the fron panel backwards. The door opened in, the magnet plate was placed on the outside right corner of the door while the magnet was to be installed on the inside left corner of the door. The grooves for the side panels were put on the outside of the door...all around someone made a huge mistake when making my table. I sadly returned it for a refund as I didn't want to take a chance on a replacement."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS NIGHT STAND!,"The most terrible piece of furniture I've ever put together. The pieces did not fit together appropriately, the screw holes were misplaced, and multiple pieces of wood split easily. I wasn't able to get one of the screws in at all because as soon as it entered the wood it began to split all the way down. Absolutely terrible quality. I'm so sorry I wasted my money on this. I recommend you DO NOT BUY this night stand!"
1,wood end table,this is a piece of junk. When I received it the side piece was broke. It took forever to get a new piece. When the new piece arrived I proceded to put this piece of junk together and found that the top was split. I would neither buy anything or recommend this company to anyone ever.
2,Not so great,I had previously purchased a similar item in store for a different room. This product was not as nice. The doors have broken off of both within the first 2 weeks. The front door on one has large grain marks and I had to put it in a location w/low light so that it looks OK. I would not purchase again and am currently trying to find out how I can request new doors.
3,ok for the money,"Neither impressed or annoyed with the quality of this nightstand. Taller than most, sturdy enough for intended usage...super simple to put together. You get what you pay for, and for tight budgets- this is not a bad deal."
2,"Good price, but very flimsy construction. Not for heavy duty use.","We got this item at a very good price, but the quality is worst than I expected. The wood panels are very thin and flimsy. The table is unstable. We bought it for our toddler's room as nightstand. It is ok, but definitely not for heavy use. My husband also cracked the door when trying to put it in just like the other user described; I actually warned him about it, but it's unavoidable because the boards are too thin and flimsy."
4,Night stands,"I bought two for the bedroom, at a reasonable price, and I'm mostly pleased with them. They were easy to put together and are good looking, but they are a little flimsy. I guess you get what you pay for."
2,Poor quality,Table looks great online but the quality is just not there. Ours came w/cracked paneling.
5,Very happy with this piece of furniture,It is a very nice piece for the price. We bought it as a table for our daughters fish tank and storage for the supplies. It goes together easily and is pretty sturdy once built. Very nice design and looks exactly as the photo shows here.
2,"Cheap price, cheap product","The side panels were not cut properly to fit in to the premade slots of the edges, so I had to saw them down. Also, since they didn't fit well, they wobbled a little. I had to use wood glue to get them to stay in place.The wooden bits that cover the screw holes keep falling out; had to glue those in as well.When all was said and done, it did the job, but looked like it needed a bit more work."
4,Great for $39,"This was fairly simple to put together. I assembled 2 in about 30 minutes. I read reviews prior to my purchase, so I expected to re-drill a few holes (and did), but it was not a big deal by any means. The end tables feel sturdy and look great. Packaging isn't all that strong though, so I could see how some people may receive damaged pieces. Overall, I say 4/5."
3,Good Enough,"Not a great quality product but it does the job in a very stylish way for a very cheap price. Not that it is unstable in any way, you just have to take into account you're getting what you're paying for. I would highly recommend to anyone with a limited budget."
3,Quality sacrificied for price,"Although these little stands are quite charming, there was definitely a sacrifice in quality that I expected at the price. Do NOT set a cup on the top without a coaster because the finish will bubble and warp. Other than that, for the price, I guess they're just fine. What can you expect from end tables at less than forty dollars? They're most definitely not up to the quality standards I've come to expect from the other Winsome Wood products I own, but they're quite nice if you don't have children who will set cups on the top."
3,Great for Decoration,"Bought these for my wife who wanted a couple of new side tables in the bedroom with a cubby to put remotes and things.The wood is quite thin and I cant imagine these lasting too long, but for what they are used for they work. The finish is nice and they do add something to our bedroom.The tops of this night stand is pretty solid and we do keep lamps and alarm clocks on them with no problem.The cubby hole is great for remotes, phones and small itemsThe storage with the door is where 2 stars get taken away from a 5 star rating. The doors VERY thin and do not shut an stay closed very well.Overall they make a nice statement in our bedroom with dark woods and are very appealing to the eye if you can look past minor issues."
2,didnt last,this was not easy to put together and was broken in 2 weeks. this items was thrown away a while ago
1,Terrible Product...,"I am not opposed to buying cheaper products and knowing that they will not be of the highest quality, but come on!!! This is just terrible! The product came with paint scratches on multiple pieces, is made of the cheapest possible materials, and was messed up on a vital screw point causing the whole thing to be loose and not fit tight. It is very flimsy, poorly made, and with the scratches and malfunctioned pieces it is a complete waste of money. It is a shame because it would have looked very nice for what I was using it for. VERY DISAPPOINTED!"
2,Cheap as it gets,"I purchased 6 of these to display empty fish tanks in my show room. You get what you pay for and this was a cheaper option than other end tables or even tank stands. For my use this will work. These are constructed in about the worst and cheap way possible. Every unit had some sort of imperfection or damage. The Chinese factory when noticing chipped paint just uses a sharpie to ""fix"" it but this doesn't even come close to matching the actual paint color. The wood cracks easy. The paint job is poor, drips and pooling everywhere.Took less than 10 mins to build each unit. In conclusion you get what you pay for, this is cheap and you barely cover the logistics cost at the list price. I would never want one of these in my house unless it is something to get by or if you are on a super budget.For my business, this will work for now. I built this."
3,Night table review,"It looks okay but I feel like if I put anything on or in it, it's going to fall apart."
4,Great Piece of Furniture for the Price,"We recently purchased a new home and purchased two of these units to be used as nightstands. When they arrived I thought the quality would be a little on the 'cheap' side, but once we put them together they proved to be rather sturdy and attractive. Assembly was pretty easy, and we are very pleased with the look and perfomance of these little nightstands."
3,Serves the purpose,"My husband bought this table/nightstand for our computer room for a smaller TV to set on , and to store our cell phone charging data-port in the cabinet. It looks nice but I must say... if you are looking for something that is not so thin, I do not recommend this. The wood is very thin and can break easily if you're not careful while assembling it."
4,Satisfactory,Overall this product is great value and appearance for the price. I did read a review talking about this nightstand gives off fumes. It does and its very strong at first. I dont know if it has gone away or now I am use to it. So that was the only distrubing thing about the product. Other than that I am very happy. :)
3,Good for the price,"These nightsands are very flattering to the eye. However, the shelving and bottom of the cabinet below are very thin. You dont want to put anything to heavy in the cubbard or on the insert shelf. Delivery was extremely quick. It's a good priced item if you dont need to store a whole lot, and is a good value for the price."
3,Its ok,Should cost less. Very cheap looking when assembling but easy to assemble. It ended up being perfect for what I needed it for.
3,ehhhhhh,"Its okay. It's flimsy, I mean if you want a good sturdy nightstand then do not get this one. The shelf in the drawer part has no support at all. and it came with 2 broken pieces. I had to glue it back together."
4,LOVE IT,"LOVE MINE they look so much better then I expected, the natural finish has a cherry accent... Which people pay good money for wood with the red cherry accent. Only issue I had was one of the pegs was to wide, but I just used a nail file too thin it out and it worked. Other wise it looked pretty high quality. Very pleased."
4,Better and bigger than I thought!,This was a wonderful product that was easy to put together and took little time to complete. I would recommend this to someone else.
3,Cheap price cheap quality,These end tables are proof that you get what you pay for. They're very flimsy and the cabinet door only opens to the right. But for the price I can't ask for much more.
1,Nightstand On Crack,This nightstand was shipped to me with cracks. An especially large and long crack was right on the top. I further recognized cracks on the legs and other wood pieces. To make this even worse the screws that they provided for the knobs were too short. So overall this is a screwed up and crack topped nightstand. It wasn't even worth returning.
3,MY END TABLE,"HMMMMM where do I begin....first off I was so frustrated with this table I had to put it aside and tackle putting it together another day and when I finally did put it together I found out that I was missing the magnetic door holder hinge.Not the best quality piece, found nicks and dings on it and even a small button of wood was missing that I needed to puzzle it together anyhow I figured it out.Now where is the magnetic piece? Are you going to send me another one?"
3,Product Review,When I received my nightstands the silicone beads were spilt all over the package and stuck in the cracks of the wood and spilt all over my floor (not to mention they are posion). Then I put the whole table together & went to pick it up and the top of the nightstand fell off. The screws that were already in there looked rusted. Now off to the store to buy wood glue to glue the top on since there is no other way to keep it on unless i resemble the whole table and then buy more screws to put into it to see if it works or not. Other than those problems the tables do look good in my room and are nice once there put together if you do not have the problems I had you are lucky!
5,Perfect Night Stand Table Thingy,"I had seen a lot of bad reviews for this, along with good ones. But it seems to me that the people who wrote those reviews either got bad luck with a broken pieces or they just don't know how to put the simple thing together. It literally took 15-20 min. tops and was so easy. All you need is a screwdriver and to be able to understand pictures. Many people said their wood cracked, either they were using a drill or they were overdoing it on the screwdriver. It is not the wood that is bad. Anyway, the quality is great! I mean for $39 n free shipping this is a very nice table to fit your home."
3,manufacturing condition,"For the price, item is ok. However, there are several manufacturing flaws that cheapen the looks of it. Assembly plant errors are very evident, leaving me to believe that the Quality Control Dept. is lacking the necessary inspection proceedures to send good products to the consumer. I probably will not purchase items from this company in the future. Packaging was sufficient to protect item during shipment and item arrived in a satisfactory time frame."
3,more like 2 1/2 stars,"The product was not exactly what I expected. I thought it would be all wood. It was not. Only the table top was wood the rest was plastic. Although, it is nice and sturdy and looks of all wood. I think its an ok piece for the price."
2,Not upto winsome woods normal quality,"I have a ton of winsome woods items in my house. I would recommend ever winsome wood item I have bought, except this table. I bought two of these thinking they would be perfect for accent tables with a bit of storage in my dining area. They do look good.The material is cheaper than other winsome wood product I have bought. One piece was chipped slight where the screw hole was. No big deal I thought. When I screwed in the piece the chip enlarge into a giant split. I used some epoxy to hold the piece together, but that only happened because the material was cheap. The sides were cheap composite wood only a little sturdier than cardboard. The front and back seemed to be wood, but with the splitting I am not so sure.The second one had no major fault like the chipped item, but it just seemed cheaper and easier to break than all they rest of their products. I own 12 winsome wood items overall, and these two are the only ones I do not recommend."
2,Eh,"Ok value for the price I guess, I should have expected it wouldn't be a quality piece. The side panels are extremely flimsy and slightly warped, which was the only thing that made assembly difficult. The top shelf is also flimsy & warped, it doesn't sit right on the brackets. It will probably flatten when I put something on it. It does look nice and matches my other furniture exactly which is why I'm even giving a 2nd star. Also, it had the weird strong odor of Band-Aids for weeks. Should have gone with something a little more expensive, I can tell I'll have to replace this thing after one move anyway."
3,Ok for the price,"Item is as described. It is made from real wood, but still cheaply made. I have ordered two of these and both of them had scratches in the finish on delivery. Overall, worth buying, but if they offered a slightly nicer one i would pay extra for it."
4,Chic Night Stand,"This item arrived in great condition. It was very well wrapped. Despite of some bad reviews, I still went for it. I assembled it last night(4/19/11) and it took me about 15 minutes tops. It's pretty nice in my bedroom and the height is just what I'm looking for to match my bed height. I've attached a photo and you can't beat the price. I'm happy with my purchased and if you're in a budget but wants something stylish, this one is for you. See for yourself."
5,Excellent quality for the price,I am an Interior designer and do a great deal of children's rooms that we often change in a year or two. This end table was a budget oriented purchase and I am happy to say appears to be one of the more costly items. It looks high end and is a very study well constructed item. The assembly was a little tricky getting the end panel on correctly and the interior shelfs are SNUG! The product is excellent quality for the price. I would not hesitate for a moment to purchase this for future projects. Michele
3,Missing parts,"One of the shelves was missing from each nightstand. I sent an email earlier to customer service and haven't had a response. I like the nightstand, but I need the 2 additional shelves."
4,Great for price,"Packaged well, before assembly I thought it was going to be very cheap and flimsy. After it was all put together it was actually pretty sturdy. And it does not smell chemically like others have said. I got 2 of them. Assembly is kind of extensive for the size of the item, no biggie though."
4,Nice Enough for the Price!,"I wanted new nightstands, but I didn't want to spend a lot on them (since I will be buying a new bedroom set in the future when we move). These were easy to put together and look pretty good. One of them looks like it has touch up paint on the top, but from far away you can't tell. For the price, I can't be too picky! My bedroom finally looks like a grown-up's (and I am almost 40)...so I am thrilled."
5,Love It.,"Great price, simple construction. Maybe a cable slot in the back would be nice but I just cut my own. Perfect upgrade for my nightstand."
2,Cracks after a while,"The product arrived in good condition. It's beautiful and sturdy enough for the money I paid (under $30 shipped). However, after a couple of years use (I put a small laser printer on top, so it's my printer stand, plus some video tapes and CDs inside the closed cabinet) I start to see cracked lines along the top and side of it. I think the material isn't great... it's unsightly after a while."
4,End tables review,"The two end tables arrived just fine, well almost. There was quite a bit of assembly to be done. The night stands are pretty nice: visually simple and very honest (as opposed to the wood grained plastic surfaces that seem to have taken over the world). The interior shelves are quite thin and might eventually sag if too many books or weighty objects are left on them. Everything arrived in almost perfect shape except a bottom corner of one of the back panels had come apart. I fixed it with a small headed finishing screw because I new that I could, and I didn't want to go through the hassle of sending it back for a replacement. We are now happy with our new neat looking and well functioning night stands."
2,"Cheap price, cheap product","I was disappointed when I got this product, opened the box and found the back piece already damaged. I wasn't expecting such poor quality from Amazon retail. The wood had split on the top of the back piece, however I was still able to build the nightstand. It was a two person job to build, someone to hold the pieces together while the other screwed pieces together. It feels a bit flimsy, but I put it against the wall, so hopefully it wont break on me anytime soon. It serves it purpose though of sitting next to my bed with my lamp on it. I was hoping to find a great deal, but you really do get what you pay for and this is one of the cheapest nightstands I found with the right color and height."
4,Great Looking Night Stand,"We purchased 2 of these night stand for our guest bedroom. The assembly was easy enough to put together (better than IKEA) in terms of fit and finish.Only recommendation is to make sure not to tighten any of the screws fully until you have inserted the back panel, else you will have to loosen the screws again.The knob finish is great and height is perfect for queen size bed with box frame.Only drawback is that the door cannot be switched. It swings out from left to right only. But not a deal breaker especially for the price.The look and finish of the night stand is comparable to most $100 night stand I've seen at local furniture stores and looks better than any IKEA night stand products."
3,You get what you pay for,"Spending $40 on a night stand/end table what else do you expect? One of the most disappointing factors would be that the doors do not align; therefore, there is a slight gap in between the door and the sides... making it look a bit cheap. This table is the normal height of most end tables at 25 inches in height but its really narrow. so make sure you check that dimension before purchasing. Its pretty easy to put together but the 2 boards in the end is really difficult to squeeze in. All in all, I would say I am satisfied because it only cost $40 ~ so you really just do get what you pay for. Its also really light ... so if you want to put something heavy inside ... definitely not recommended."
3,Hit or miss....,"I just received these (two) today. One of the tables looks awesome! There is nothing wrong with it and it looks great next to our bed. The other looked like it had been scratched at the factory and then patched so you can't tell (but you still can...). The patched work that they did is chipping off (the paint) on one side of the top of the table. I don't feel like sending it back, so I'll just get out a black Sharpie to fix the chipping.I really think these are hit or miss. Like I said, I LOVED the first one I put together! The only other complaint is that the sides (not front and back) are really thin. I also thought that there was a shelf in the cabinet portion, but there is not."
2,Super light wood maybe its balsa wood,Very light and cheap price but cant expect too much. It holds my 16 bottle wine cooler. But i wouldnt put more that 30lbs on it.
1,quality was bad,"the quality for this wasnt so good the wood has cracked when i was puting it together also the wholes where u suppose to connect wasnt in the right place,i had to make a big effort to try and put it togethre,but again for$32 i had to live with it it's not worth returning but actually if i saw it for free i wouldnt take it..."
1,Never again,"Yes the screw for the knob is to small - I would think they would have this fixed already. And putting it together...the pieces don't fit together at all, that is the holes are even cut out."
3,No instructions; no power drill,"No instructions came with this product and no power drill was included either. The nails are HELL to screw in manually. I think I'm going to use nails to finish putting it together tomorrow because I am not buying a power drill anytime soon. Hell, if I could afford one, I wouldn't have even purchased THIS cheap thing. It's okay."
1,no pretty,"This was the cheapest thing I ever bought in my life, saw the reviews. well not sure what they got but mine was a hunk of junk. next time I will learn buy from a furniture store..."
4,Perfect Nightstand for the Regular Guy,I bought two of them because they were on sale and they are perfect if you need something quick and have simple tastes. I was able to assemble them quickly. They are the perfect height and they look pretty nice.
3,OK,"Table came is really fast. Will do the job, but came broken!! I don't have time to deal with it so I just put it together and will get some wood glue."
3,A little flimsy. . .,"We recently bought 2 of these table to use as nightstands. They were easy to put together and ""look"" good but they are very thin. While most of the table is sturdy, the shelves are so thin they would crack if your not very careful with what you put on them. We only paid $39 each for them so for that price they are fine."
4,Not bad for the price,"These night stands are decent fibreboard construction and easy assembly...typically. I got 2 and one had a surprise - it was missing 2 holes for shelf supports. No biggie given what I paid (~50 each), and I was able to drill the holes where I needed and they work and look great next to our black wood bed frame."
5,Good Job!,"These came quickly and were really packed well. No scratches or dents, etc. - Nothing missing. They look real good and matched our bedroom furniture - dark espresso wood."
2,IT'S OKAY,"some of the holes were in the wrong places, my husband had to basically make different holes, and all the parts were not in the packaging. it looks nice though in my living room once we got it all set up."
4,"Easy to build, even if a little off.","This end table is by no means high quality, but it looks great and is very easy to build. It took me about 20 minutes from start to finish. My only gripe being that some of the areas don't connect very well and because of this I ended up about a centimeter off on one of the legs. Obviously not everyone will have this issue, but it's still worth pointing out."
3,"Ridiculously cheap parts, but nice looking.","It is actually very nice looking once put together. HOWEVER, I ordered two and BOTH had incorrect parts. One was missing 4 shelf pins for assembly and the other had a complete wrong bar/brace that connected the front to the back on the bottom of the nightstand. Fortunately, my boyfriend is handy and was able to MacGyver the pieces into something that would work. He also experienced the cracking when inserting the screws that others have spoke about. In general, it was pretty poor quality but looks nice. So bottom line is if you are looking for something nice looking, this will do the job, but if you need the nightstand to be functional right away, I wouldn't risk purchasing this because it may or may not have correct parts or may or may not break as soon as you put it together. Definitely allow extra time to return it, if necessary!"
4,Side Table,Good sturdy little table & easy to put together. I am using as a telephone stand & it has good storage also.
3,Not bad for the price,"This is a pretty decent nightstand for the low price. If you are looking for an inexpensive nightstand for a guest room, dorm or just need something that has this type of look, I'd definitly recommend this. But if you like high quality wood work and want to be able to stand on it to change a lightbulb, you might want to consider spending more $$ on something heavier. Easy to assemble."
1,Incredibly flimsy,"This looked a >lot< nicer in the pictures. What we received was a thin, floppy piece of furniture that barely holds together. The thickness of the sides, door, and bottom are less than 1/4"". The overall size is smaller than the listed dimensions, as well, which was important to me. Most of the pieces slide a little even when screwed in tightly. The caps to cover the screw holes pop out immediately, so we will probably have to glue them in. It even wobbles when placed on a linoleum floor! I'm afraid to press on any part of it for fear it will snap. The only reason I don't return it is that we purchased it to convert into a hidden cat litter box. I comfort myself with the thought that my cat will likely have no reason to put pressure on it.I would NOT recommend this to anyone. $50 is too steep for how cheap this end table is. I honestly just don't want to go through the effort and money to return it, but I do feel jipped. Oh well; live and learn, right?"
4,Product Review,This end table is perfect for anyone on a tight budget. The cost is very reasonable and the quality is adequate. The assembly only takes a few minutes and can be done with just a few basic tools
3,GREATEST HITS 2,"This is Bon Jovi's 2nd Greatest hits cd, good album but alot of repeats from the original greatest hits 'Cross road'.Would've been better focusing more on the albums that came out after Cross road :'These Days' and 'Crush' do feature on this compilation but not enough and also could've had songs from the 'Bounce' and 'This left feels right' albums if they held off releasing this compilation a little longer."
3,Insightful interviews.,"Aine O'Conner manage to capture the cadences of the various actors very well. While reading the text, I could almost hear the men speaking their words. I suspect that she didn't edit the tapes very much, save for verbal pauses (the usual ""uhs"" and ""you knows"") and for length. Ms. O'Conner also included several photographs (many were candid) that were sprinkled throughout the various sections.While Ms. O'Conner asked many insightful questions, she didn't follow through on many. Indeed, at times I was a little disappointed that she failed to follow up on specific points; however, that point is trivial compared to the overall effort of the book.If you are a fan of any or all of the actors listed, or simply are curious to see how contemporary Irish actors are dealing with the joys and disappointments of Hollywood, then you should enjoy this book."
1,Boring,"I found this to be one of the dullest, dryest, most boring books I've ever attempted to read. I almost fell asleep while reading it. It could have used an editor from Reader's Digest to perk it up and make it more intelligible, especially the sophistry of spirit versus matter. The authors make a feeble attempt at humor that falls flat. It is not an impartial, unbiased or critical look at New Thought (one of the authors is the editor of the INTA magazine). For a better read, choose Claude Bristol's TNT-the Power Within You."
3,Average,"The last single released from TIMTTMY. ""Tsunami"" is a catchy little tune that has a Sitar init and its pretty tuneful musically. Lyrically it's pretty much like all the other songs on TIMTTMY. ""Buildings For The Dead"" is straight out cheesy rock which Nicky Wire said in an interview may be a flavor of the new album(Oh no). The single ends with a live version of ""Motown Junk"" which they sing about half the lyrics and opens with James singing the Motown classic ""Baby Love"". ""Motown Junk"" live is an amazing experience but this isn't the best example. James ends with ""Yada Yada Yada Rock 'N' Roll""....You're wondering if they even care anymore? Oh Yeah its the manics nevermind."
2,Attempt at a complex subject,"A lot of text, and I mean a lot, accompanies the drawings in this book. In fact, there is more page space devoted to the text than the coloring sections -- sure to disappoint children. The text is a good attempt to discuss a very complicated period of history and a rather difficult man to understand regardless of what ""biographers"" claim. The biggest problems I have with this coloring book are: Is the subject really appropriate for children and why aren't all the drawings labeled for where and when the originals were created."
1,uggghhh...,"the movie is a total bomb in every way, starring high school dropout hilary swank as a teacher trying to convince kids not to...drop out. the real story is a rehash of stand by me, the substitute, etc. i'm sure you could find 2 dozen previous examples of 'teacher who believes in at-risk youths' or 'teacher who cares when no one else did'. and they'd all be better than this nonsense. in addition, the kids (from all backgrounds) are all so cliched it's ridiculous. pass on this book."
3,you can skip the last half,A very wonderful tale except the last bit of the book had little to do with teaching. I enjoyed and learned some new methods on gaining the respect and attention from students. however i learned nothing after she got that from her students except that it helps to know a rich ceo.
2,Kinda boring,"This book is okay. I wish Erin didn't portray herself so perfectly all the time. She always does the right thing to an annoying extent. She has so many resources and calls in so many favors to help her students, plus she spends her own money on them and gives them rides everywhere. Lucky students!"
4,Falsies can be fun,"I have been trying to master false eyelashes for months now. I don't want a big movie star look, just want a simple little lash with a longer look than my own. Well it's good these are inexpensive and give you lots of pairs. First, I do cut them in half and use the on the outer edge of my eye. Second, if you didn't cut them in half, you'd have to have a large eye because they are big. But my big help and secret to falsies is - Revlon glue with brush applicator. Why did no one think of this before? You just pull the brush out of the glue and brush it lightly on the edge of the falsie. Then aim it toward the lash line, holding by the end and place. Voila! No drama. And when you pick the right one for you and cut them correctly you can have a natural or extreme look. But the brand is good and, like I say, inexpensive so you can use them everyday. So come on Amazon and add Revlon Glue with brush to your wares."
5,perfect!!!!,PERFECT!!!! THANK U Great timing with the dely!Works great for the chinese auction I'm in charge of.Great price too.
3,essential christianity,Great book. Takes to basic elements of the christian faith and explains them in detail. Would recommend to anyone wanting to know what the essential christian faith is all about. This book was written by a scholar. He also was the leader in cult research for over 30 years. A great defender of the true biblical essential doctrines of the faith.
4,A good intro,"Look at this as the Spacemen's ""white album"" --Sonic Boom and Jason Pierce each wrote and produced one side of this record; the band was essentially finished. The first side, from Sonic Boom, is clearly reminiscent of his work in Spectrum. The second side, all written and recorded by J. Spaceman, sounds much like Spiritualized. It's more straightforward and accessible than some of their earlier releases, but it's nowhere near as good as Playing With Fire or The Perfect Prescription."
2,Laughing Boy,Might have been more interesting in it's time period. I found it difficult to get through. Good thing it is under 200 pages.
2,I don't understand why this won a pulitzer,"The story is sub-par at best, and written in a tedious and trite style. The plot development is slow, lacking any real action. Though I appriciate La Farge's sentiment, I think it is poorly expressed. The only thing I liked about the book was the character development, but that alone cannot salvage this book. Save your money and time and read Steinbeck instead. God I love Steinbeck."
5,Historians approve of this one,"As an award-winning Arizona historian, I'd like to pass on that several Arizona pioneers and fellow historians recommended this book to me and I'd like everyone who is interested in Indian/Anglo relations to read it. LaFarge lived in the Four Corners area in the 1920s and published Laughing Boy as his masters thesis for an anthropology degree. And yet it is also fine writing, well crafted and as artistic as Laughing Boy's silver work. Along with ""The Virginian"" this is a very early example of western fiction which has survived the test of time. It's not often that one can absorb historical truths through fiction, but when done as well as this is, it is truly the best way to learn and enjoy."
5,A Java dream,"Symantec Visual Cafe Sourcebook is geared for novice programersand advanced developers alike. The book cover all aspects of Javadevelopment, from creating an Applet to muti-threaded debugging.Little is provided in the way of a Java language reference. However, Iteach you how to develope Java Applets and applications without gettingto much into the code.You will like it! And here is an open offer: If you get stuck,drop me a line and I would love to help you.Cary A. Jardincjardin@xprime.comPresident and EngineerX'"
1,Save your money!,"I too wished I'd read the reviews first. I have 3.0c and this book might as well be for another product for all the good it does me. It's amazingly basic - if you have used VC for more than a couple of hours, you could have written it yourself."
1,waste of money unless you are an ultra beginner,"This book reads like a brochure for Visual Cafe...I can use the manual to walk me through the menu options.For a book that titles itself ""Sourcebook"", it is pathetically short of source code examples. There's once decent sample program in the first quarter, and the rest was just fluf.I suppose this book might be useful if you truly had no clue, but even then I'd question it."
2,There Still Isn't a Good Visual Cafe Book.,For beginners only. The claimed coverage of Visual Cafe Pro is pathetic. Some parts of the book sound like they're written by the Symantec Marketing Department. Class/component descriptions are bare-bones ... Visual Cafe itself provides more information. Experienced programmers will find this book irritating to read and completely useless as a reference manual.
2,Waste of money & time!-But may be good for beginner,"The authors spent a lot of time talking about GUI, RAD programming and many of introduction, and not covered real performance of Visual Cafe or Visual Cafe Pro. I think its title should be 'Introduction of Symantec Visual Cafe Sourcebook'.I recommend this book to beginner with little or no GUI or RAD programming experience, and who want to know about Visual Cafe GUI. But if you want to learn Visual Cafe Pro, it's not for you."
3,Good for beginners -- not very useful for actual programmers,"The book is a quick, general overview of Symantec Visual Cafe; users of Visual Cafe Pro won't find it much use, since less than 20 pages is devoted to data aware applications. Also, although the author covers the standard components, no mention is made of many of the other components Symantec bundles with Visual Cafe, such as menus and forms. In fairness, though, the author welcomes email and when I asked him how to create a dialog box, he responded quickly and cheerfully, even sending me a sample file.Since Symantec's documentation is virtually nonexistent at this point, I would recommend this book to people with little or no programming experience. An experienced programmer, however, will likely only find the book useful for the first week or so; after that, it becomes time to rely on the Symantec newsgroups for information and nitty-gritty implementation details."
2,losts of words little information,"Symantec Visual Cafe Sourcebook spends a lot of time listing the names of ""widgets"", ""events"", and ""event responces"" but none explaining the function or the how to"
3,Turn My World Upside Down: Jo's Story,"The book is excellent. Unfortunately the Kindle edition is sorely lacking. The quality was poor, at best. At times I could not even figure out the wording in a paragraph. No problems with the story, but Kindle edition needs big time improvement."
5,Good good movie,Went the Day Well is a historic and popular concept occuring during WWII.The invasion of England by Germany should it occur.It supposes that Germany indeed lands on English soil and the possibilites this would create.It is an excellent film. Yes five stars...ten!
2,Obviously old....,"I ordered this because my 3 year old daughter loves piggy bubble bath...kinda random but I was glad to find a retailer that offered it. I was a little disappointed when it came. It had obviously been sitting discarded on a back shelf, it was battered and dirty. The sticker was barely staying on any more and it was marked with a 2009 expiration date. The bath jelly barely comes out and is obviously old. I give it two stars because it was shipped and arrived in a timely manner and honestly my daughter is just happy to have the piggy packaging, the bath gel was an after thought. That being said, for almost $10 (and just over 3oz) I would have hoped for better attention to detail on this product and I personally would avoid this retailer in the future."
3,Not a programming resource but an interesting read,"I bought the book hoping for a guide to programming a network application in Java. It turns out that there is not a bit of code in the book (well, there is a bit to describe OOP). While the info in it is very interesting and a good read for someone interested in programming in Java seriously, it is not for the reference bookshelf.It mainly covers the market, evil Microsoft's efforts to destroy Java, trends, security, and an excellent section on why Java is better than C++."
3,Especailly not good for preparing Java Architect Certificate,"I bought this book because I was told that this book is good for Java Architect Certificate. Actually, except for some company stories, (like the lawsuit of Microsoft or something like that), I learn little from this book."
3,Decent Overview,"Provides a decent overview, at a high level of the state of Java and how it compares with competing development approaches. It falls short by being biased in its approach towards Sun's view of the world. But, what else could you expect from a book produced by Sun?"
5,An excellent book,"This is a unique book in the marketplace. The title is a play off of Peter's previous ""Just Java"", which I highly recommend. In this book, Peter takes about Java, all associated technologies, and all its majorcompetitors.Instead of a lot of technical facts, Peter analyzes the history of computing and what he thinks will happen in the future. Sometimes I agree withPeter and at other times I don't. However, unlike most authors I disagree with, Peter has my upmost respect because he fully explains why hecame to the conclusion he reached and they are reasonably valid.As usual, Peter's writing style is extremely readable and fun. You shouldn't fall asleep reading this book.This book is for anyone who is thinking about using Java, is using Java and wants to know how it may affect computing in the future, or theperson who is anti-Java to gain insight into what they are missing. The book is pro-Java, but admits that Java is not the be-all, end-all ofcomputing. I recommend this book highly."
4,Great book to learn about the explosion of new technologies,"If you're like me, you've been wondering what all those acronyms floating around the tech world mean. What's CORBA? What's IIOP? This book describes, with graphical illustrations, what new ideas are emerging, how to use them, and how they're supposed to help us survive the techno revolution. It was very well written and very interesting. The only problem I had was the author's constant attacks at Microsoft. Given that the book was published by Sun Microsystems, who designed Java to be simpler than C++ and Microsoft's Windows, I can understand the resentment. However, in describing Microsoft's new technologies like ActiveX, the author only points out the flaws and not any of the benefits. I would have prefered a book that was more neutral on competing trends. Other than that, Not Just Java is an excellent book"
2,"This book should cost $9.99, not worth paying the price","The book is interesting because it provides a lot of information about what's going on and what are the trends in the industry as of the end of the 20th century. The problem is that this book speaks only from Sun Microsystems' point of view, so it's not very objective. I also think the author goes a little too far trying to thrash Microsoft and make Java seem like it's a solution to all problems of the world. One thing which is obviously wrong with his point of view is that he is trying to convince readers to use Java for its good things, even though Java's performance sucks. I personally work for a company where efficiency is the most crucial thing, so whatever benefits Java offers, they are not very helpful to us. Bottom line is, it's pretty interesting to read, but don't believe everything there is."
2,Cultural bias served with a side order of Java,I had hoped that this book would give me a broad overview of what Java provides and when/how to use Java as an architecture. Unfortunately the message was all but lost in a sea of Microsoft bashing. I can understand making some comparisons but it is obvious that Mr Van Linden has a major axe to grind.If you wade through the incessant bashing there are some interesting points on Java but it isn't plainly stated or well organized enough.
3,disappointing for the technical reader,This book was a disappointment for me because it assumes the reader has very little knowledge of the topics it covers.
5,A Journey into the History of Soul Food,"Soul and Spice is a well presented compilation of recipes from the African, African American (Southern Region) and Caribbean cultures. The author successfully presents the broad spectrum of culinary arts of people of African descent with added nuggets of historical information for context.This cookbook is user friendly with recipes suitable for cooks of all levels. An excellent book to add to your collection!"
1,Living Books problem w/ XP,"After a number of back and forth email contacts with the supplier - it turns out that to use this item on XP, there is a complicated series of changes to the settings of the computer that need to be done. I couldn't do it. And a child for sure could not even attempt it. For all practical purposes, this item is not XP compatible. I wanted to return it - and they refused."
3,Just Grandma and Me,I have seen this program by living books before and would highly recommend it. Unfortunately this particular copy I have seems to also be an advertisement for AOL and I find we are constantly being booted out of the program. It is frustrating for my toddler and for me! If you can obtain the Living Book disc without any other special offers (AOL) then I would highly recommend it.
4,Overall a good reference book but...,"This book has the potential for being an excellent reference manual. It is well organized, the writing style is concise and straight to the point, the layout is well structured and alot of topics are covered. However, some areas are covered better than others. I found the section on Internet Explorer web controls to be excellent. But I was disappointed in the database code section. Some topics such as the datareader object aren't even covered. Other tips such as using a dataset to retrieve a single value from a database and executing a stored procedure via an ""exec procedure"" string left me shaking my head. I wish the author addressed more practical issues like how to create a master/detail form.3.5 stars"
5,Angel Baby By: The Origaniles),I love this CD so much because it's from the 50's times I love the 50's times. I only like the songs abought like I'm your pupet or angel baby or Johnny Angel.
4,"While I disagree with much, a good read!",This book sheds light on a lot of philosophical thoughts and ideas often not discussed in the realm of philosophy. A good read indeed!
5,songs of the islands,i had the great pleasure of seeing wayne when he was over here on tour.he told me he wanted to record an hawaiian album like marty robbins did and jasmine have gave him the opportunity to do so. well done you have hit the right note here.
1,"Misleading product, does not work with laptops","I will not buy any Belkin product again. Company has caused me a lot of grief trying to get this to work with my laptop/docking station and desktop. They should have made this limitation known upfront. They can choose to engage in deceptive marketing practices, but consumers have a choice too."
3,nice little switch with major design flaw,"I have been using this switch at work for a couple of weeks. It works well when using the keyboard shortcut. It is powered by the keyboard PS2 connection, so no power adapter is required. One small complaint about the unit is the bundled cables are 3 pieces for each computer, instead of being molded together, so I've got a LOT of wires under my desk now.Now for the big complaint. For me, this is a deal-killer. If I were using this at home and paid my own money for it I would have returned it. There are ports for connecting cables on ALL FOUR SIDES of the unit. Who decided that was a good idea? The cables are heavy and take several inches to turn 90 degrees, so the unit takes up about 12"" X 12"" on my desk. This is unacceptable. Please, KVM Switch designers, all the cables should exit the back of the unit, unless it is designed to be mounted in a server rack."
3,BEEEEEEEEEEEEEP,"Works fine, but the beeps can be heard in every cube in the room. My work environment is quiet. The beep was VERY annoying until I opened the switch up and stuffed tissue into the little hole in the little round speaker. Opening it up requires you to split the product ID sticker in half and voids the warranty, but it was worth it because I was about to smash it anyways. They should have put a switch on the speaker."
3,PLEASE STOP THE BEEPING!!!!,"First off, make no mistake about it, this product functions very well. I was up and running in minutes, easily switching between two computers. Here's the rub. There is an audible alert each time you switch between computers. I have no problem with an audible alert between switches. I do, however, have a HUGE problem with the fact that, short of splitting this thing open and voiding your warrenty, you have no control over whether this thing beeps and how loud the beep is. My rating? Beep Beep Beep. One for each star. 3*s"
2,Not for Laptops or docking stations,"The packaging indicates that it works with all PC's, so I bought it and connected it to my Desktop and my Laptop. It worked on occasion when I switched to the laptop, and since the documentation said it worked with all PC's I figured I had a driver issue, and would get to it when I could. It wasn't until I called Belkins tech support (very hard to get through to by the way) that I was informed that it does not work with laptops nor is there a fix. The only reason it's still in use in my office is because I need a monitor extension cord.Nice boat anchor."
2,Desktop octopus,"The device functions fine and I had no problems with setup. But due to the poor industrial design, I wouldn't have one of these if you paid me to take it.The cabling connectors coming out of all 4 sides gives it a substantial footprint. And then you have the cables sprawling out every which way, too. On the desk or under foot, this thing is a nuisance.Spend some extra money and get better designed switch. It's cheaper than a bigger desk."
3,Not for IBM Thinkpad users with docking station...,"I thought I read somewhere that the Belkin KVM worked with a Thinkpad docking station but if I did it doesn't. I decided on the Belkin over the IO Gear hoping it would work but I lost the bet. On top of that it doesn't work well with my wireless keyboard either. The keyboard intermittently loses it's connection and you discover that if you type like me, looking at the keyboard, you can lose half of what you're typing if you don't check once and a while. In a very typical set up this might work fine and I actually liked the beeping that others complained about because I have the KVM under my desk and the noise level is just right. All in all this was an inexpensive gamble and I have lots of very nice spare cables."
5,WOW,"My god man, what can I say? This album is simply SWEET to put it mildly. Anybody that hasnt picked this up and loves it heavy and fast paced needs to go get this album. Chad Gray of Mudvayne has done one hell of a job singing these guys to his label. I'm not gonna sit here and continue to ramble for you retards...JUST GO OUT AND GET IT NOW!!!!!"
3,potential,"This band does sound like VOD, just later VOD not early. If you disagree I will kill you. This band has good potential but there is something missing. I can't quite put my finger on it. The singer is his usual brillant self, and I like the lyrics, most of the music is heavy but the just don't put it all together in any one song. Alll songs are ok, none are great. I will still buy their next album because I hear such potential but this album fails to deliver the goods. Now, I hope I don't have to kill you"
4,Don't listen to these people,"These guys are classified as metalcore. Most people who like hardcore would love this band. The band focuses most on the vocals more than anything else which is not a bad thing. Tim Williams has a similar scream to the singer of the Refused so if you like the refused I suggest trying this band out. I gave it 4 stars because its standard metalcore(Singing, breakdowns ect...) which is not a bad thing, but its all been done before. On the positive side, Tim Williams gives it all he has both live and on the cd and before buying the cd i suggest you looking them play at the starland ballroom on youtube. Type in Bloodsimple and it should be the third video. Seriously if you have a taste for hardcore i suggest trying them out but if your looking for a more metal sound go somewhere else. Remember this is straight anger pump up music. I have a taste for every type of metal so i think i know what im taking about :p"
4,A breath of fresh air,"This is an absolutely killer arena-rock album; it sounds like someone put Queen, Styx and Kansas in a blender, and there has been nothing like it for at least ten years, probably more. The production is a little too over-the-top; the lyrics of ""Burn Forever"" are drowned out by keyboards, and ""In Chains"" would have been awesome at three and a half minutes, instead of borderline torturous at six and a half. Still, ""Wonderland"" and ""Ray of Sunshine"" are nothing short of masterpieces, and the rest of the album is solid and gets better with each listening. If any of the current crop of ""melodic rock"" bands has a shot at real commercial success, it's these guys."
4,Good toothbrush,"My oral hygenist recommended this toothbrush for dry-brushing. It's very easy to handle, and it can get into all the little places where regular brushes fail."
2,"Brush wore out quickly, otherwise fine.","After about 1 month of use, this brush was too worn down to be useful. Nothing great about this one, but its best feature is probably the shape."
4,Diplomatic Danger with Miles Vorkosigan,"Diplomatic Immunity starts with Miles watching a recording of his son's conception (in vitro -- and you thought people showing their sonograph pictures were weird). He and Ekatarin are on their way home from a delightful galactic honeymoon, and they're eager to get home for the babies' uncorking from their uterine replicators. Needless to say, he is delayed. A Komarran trade fleet is being held at Graf Station after an altercation between Barrayaran MPs and station security.Old friends, aquaintances, and enemies turn up in due course and complicate matters. Will Miles solve the mystery? Will he and Ekatarin make it home in time? Or will Aral and Cordelia have to raise their grandchildren?Bujold did a fine job as usual thinking up bad things for Miles. She didn't use Ekatarin as much as I hoped, but those times she acted independantly were intelligently played. I liked this one about as much as Komarr or Brothers in Arms."
5,Brilliant Addition to An Outstanding Series,"Lois McMaster Bujold's new ""Miles Vorkosigan"" novel DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY leads newlywed Imperial Auditor Miles Vorkosigan and his wife Ekaterin into deep space investigating a mysterious disappearance/murder of a Barrayaran soldier at a space station of the genetically engineered Quaddies(remember them from FALLING FREE ?). But things are not quite as easy as that. Bujold offers another fast-paced, character-driven novel full of twists and turns. Miles is as clever as ever, but this time he has his lady at his side to help him. Don't miss this exciting addition to the adventures of Miles Vorkosigan..."
3,Disappointing Miles,"The last three Vorkosigan books (Memory, Komarr, A Civil Campaign) have gone onto my all-time favorite books list. So it was just too much to hope that Bujold could keep up that momentum. This isn't a bad book, but it seems more like an interlude from the grand Vorkosigan plotline.Although one parallel really disturbs me. I've always thought Miles owed more to Lord Peter Wimsey than any other inspiration. (A suspicion I felt was confirmed when Dorothy Sayers was one of the people A Civil Campaign was dedicated to). My favorite Lord Peter novel is Gaudy Night, in which Peter proposes to Harriet. And that was pretty much the end of the series. The last Lord Peter novel (Busman's Honeymoon) has the married Peter and Harriet solving a crime together, but the passion was gone. I hope that the same will not prove true for Miles and Ekaterin."
3,More of the same,"More of the same, that was the disappointing part in this book, after Civil Campaign, which was one of the funniest books, bar none, I have ever read, I expected some more development in Mile's story. While for someone who has never read any Miles Vorkosigian this would be great, I felt for Lois Bujold it was coasting. No Ivan, No Pym, No Mark, no Emperor Gregor, No explosive loving planet Barrayar, no Koudleka girls, nothing of the elements that made the last book one of my re-read treasures, she can do better, that was the sad part."
4,Miles in danger again,"It helps when reading this book if you've read all the previous Miles Vorkosigan series. Many of the characters are from earlier works and there's not a lot of explanation on how they got there or where they met before.Miles and Ekaterin are on their delayed honeymoon while their twins are in uterine replicators back home to be 'born' when they return. Gregor asks Miles to take care of a little problem in Quaddie space -- it seems that the fleet might have over reacted to a small problem because of the quaddies four arms (and the Barrayaran horror of mutants).The problem is knotty but not too bad when suddenly is morphs into Cetagandan intrigue, plague viruses, the haut yearly child ship, and Miles on the edge of death.Again, it's a fun read and the usual Miles Vorkosigan fare. There's a chance to visit with old friends we haven't seen in books lately and to catch up."
3,It was okay,"I don't think Lois Bujold is able to write a truly bad book, but I have to admit to a sneaking disappointment after the brilliance of the last three (Memory, Komarr, and most especially A Civil Campaign). Partly this is because having at last got Miles and Ekaterin safely engaged, I think fans were owed a wedding and a bedding! This we don't get since Diplomatic Immunity is set eighteen months after that event.But more seriously, having introduced us to Ekaterin in the previous two books - and she's a character just as appealing as Miles - Bujold shuffles her offstage for much of the book. It's almost as though she doesn't quite know what to do with her. A tragic waste.Still, for all this there are some good lines in the book and a fairly tense climax in which Miles saves the day again. And we also get to see the arrival of the next generation of Vorkosigans, which has got to be good news. Read it and hope for more from the next installment."
3,Not Her Best Effort,"The Stories about Miles are just about my favorite, and this one is good too. But not up to the others in the series. I was expecting more involvement of Miles's new wife, but she appears as a very minor charachter out of the action in most of the book.I think there could have been more development of the story also.Not to say it is a bad read, it is better than 80% of fiction published every year. I was hoping for more of the Miles and Kat working together to ""crack the case""Summary: a good story, worth reading, weak on plot development."
4,"Well, I had wondered ...","Lois never wastes words.Even at her most descriptive and ebulliant, she never wastes a single word. This is a good thing, considering the relative shortness and lightness of this book among her oeuvre. What springs immediately to the eye as a cat's snarl of brightly colored threads is, by the end, all woven tightly into a beautifully detailed wall-hanging. And, thriftily, she has tied it off with loose threads from earlier books as well.Lois does mystery, comedy, space-opera, romance, and drama. Any one book has all of these elements, and usually one predominates. This one is a mystery.Enjoy."
5,New Miles set *before* Diplomatic Immunity !,"Love A Civil Campaign & the book right after it, Diplomatic Immunity? Through the magic of out-of-order authorship, we can now go back and enjoy the period *between* those two books!Bujold has written a new Miles novella called Winterfair Gifts. It's in the anthology Irresistible Forces by Jennifer Roberson, et al. (publication date February 3, 2004). The story reportedly covers . . . events presaged in A Civil Campaign."
4,Wow!,"I don't understand it at all. This woman writes what is for money the best fiction anywhere and yet I walk into bookstores or mention her to people and get blank stares. She should be a household name by now and this book proves it again, as if the Hugo's and Nebulas weren't enough proof of her Gift for the Craft of writing. This book is filled with the awe inspiring wit anyone who's a fan of hers (and her characters) have come to relish. Miles is back, and on his honeymoon when duty calls (actually Gregor sent a courier) and he has to make a stop at an out of the way place Lois fans have heard of but not seen before. Much to the surprise of Miles and the delight of me, we run into an old associate of Miles, and a few old enemies as well, or are they new ones.... I really loved this book and i was very tempted to give it five stars but as a posted on a message board it wasn't long enough (and they never are).... cheers"
2,Lackluster & with a bonehead error,"While I love Miles books, this one had a bonehead error: Miles is looking for someone who can produce synthetic blood. He's walking down the hall with someone who admits to having a bunch of uterine replicators he has to attend to. But he doesn't put 2 and 2 together. Ever. Argh!This, unfortunately, is only one example of why this book doesn't sparkle as much as some of the others in the series, especially following on the heels of _A Civil Campaign_. It simply wasn't thought through as deeply and it shows.This is not to say that it doesn't have good moments, but it doesn't have great moments like the dinner scene in Campaign.I'll keep the hardcover as a set-completer, but I hope the next Miles book is better."
2,"Rehashed plot, nothing new, disappointing","While I've really enjoyed the first dozen books in this series, unfortunately the author is apparently starting to write new books just for the money. In this case, the plot is predictable and not different from all the other stories. It will be disappointing for anyone looking for the quality of the other Miles novels."
1,By far the worst of the Vorkosigan series,"I'm a great fan of Bujold, and in particular of the Vorkosigan series. But this one is a lemon. Clearly, and very unusually for her, Bujold had nothing to say and no idea what to write about. The only reason to read this book is if you've read every other Vorkosigan book (and the superb Curse of Chalion), in which case you probably loved them so much you wouldn't trust this review anyway."
2,Not a Good Stand Alone Novel,"This is the first book of Miss Bujold's that I have read. Frankly, I found it to be an uninteresting read for the most part. Her characters are flat, with obvious nudges towards previous novels, and no explanations for these nudges whatsoever. The plot is thin in many places, the characters are somewhat predictable in their mannerisms. Her writing style is somewhat short, and her plot mechanisms are thread-bare. But I will note, that this is one book in a series. My impressions may have been different if I had started with the first novel."
1,Rip-off of faithful readers,"LMB run out of ideas already in the previous book ""Civil Campaign""; that book was running on the momentum of the previous ones.""Diplomatic Immunity"" is much worse. It's plot, if it could be called a plot-line, is 1950's science fiction horror based, boring from beginning to end. The pages run on ""idle"", the reader is continuously expecting magnificence to emerge, the way the previous stories used to be ... and continuously disappointed.The entire tome is an attempt to cash in on the glories of the past, which was truly outstanding ... BR>I have every Miles book, in hard cover, on my bookshelf. I will not buy a used paperback of ""Diplomatic Immunity"" and I suggest you do the same.Shame on LMB for playing false with our trust."
2,Losing steam,"The plot of Diplomatic immunity is pretty much vintage Bujold peppered with stupid asides. Perhaps this is a holdover from her recent foray into fantasy, an excursion I found unsuited to her writing style. She is much more at home here, in the easier world building of the future, but something is missing. The characterization that made Miles so endearing is growing thin.That being said, it's not a really awful book. For Bujold fans, however, it is disappointing."
1,Hugely dissapointing and lacklustre,"Let me begin by saying I am (& remain) a huge Miles fan. I have enjoyed (& occasionally re-read) every one of the previous books.However, IMHO this book falls far short of any previous offering, failing to ""spark"" pretty well from the start. It feels ""rehashed"" with the plot devices feeling all too familar and often being telegraphed (eg the handkercief).I initially thought this slowness and familiarity was a ploy to lull me into a false sense of security before a whiplash plot twist or revelation a la ""Memory"". However, there are no twists or interwoven layers here and the characterisation (especially Bel's) is way short of what we have come to expect from Lois.That being said I'm hanging out for the next installment and hoping for a return to Miles' usual blinding form!!"
2,Not a typical Bujold novel,"I've been a major fan of Lois McMaster Bujold for quite some time, and I was mildly horrified by Diplomatic Immunity - characters that typically would have been rich, complex, and interesting came through as extremely two dimensional. In fact, the main reason I checked this amazon page is that I figured that it may have, somehow, been written by someone else.When I first read the Warrior's Apprentince I was captivated by many things, among them were the complexity of the cultures the author creates, the occasionally fallible nature of the hero, and the 3 dimensional, very lifelike antagonists; all of these qualities were somehow missing in this book.I still hold out hope that I, somehow, received a counterfit copy. Overall it was OK, but it was not what I was expecting."
2,Disappointing book as well as some reviews...,"I was really disappointed - after brilliant ""Civil Campain"" I expected for something bigger and stronger. And all we got was mixture of ""Cetaganda"" motives and ""Komarr""'s plot (Auditor investigating...), unfortunately minus Miles-Ekaterin romance...!Probably Lois used her yearly supply of talent on ""Curse of Chalion""? Kidding! Lois is talented enough for making this book readable and funny! (Terry Goodkind, please LEARN something from her!!!)P.S. By the way, I disagreee with the people saying ""Cetaganda"" was a cheap knock-off"
2,Pretty TV with big white spot on blue back,"My daughter received this TV a couple of weeks ago, but we have been so busy we never set it up. The shipping was awesome, the price was awesome, but we have one problem. There is a big white circle in the lower left corner when it is on the blue background. It isn't there when the DVD's or games are played, but I don't know what it is. I will call customer service. Other that that, it works great. There are plenty of cable hookups to play games, and it makes it easy for a 3 year old to learn."
3,Fun gift for your tween!!,"We did have a problem with this TV soon after our purchase. The sound just stopped working. The picture was fine, but the sound didn't work. We went through the whole refund process and then my 4 year old electronic genius did something to it and it now works just fine again. It's the perfect addition to my daughter's room, and it's very easy to use!"
1,TERRIBLE PRODUCT,"Apparently my sister did not do her homework on this as several of the reviews have the same issue. She bought this for my daughter (3 years old) for Christmas. Within two weeks, the DVD player was not working correctly and now it does not work at all. It tells me that there is no disc or unknown disc in player. I even went as far as to buy her a brand new DVD thinking all of her's were scratched and it was no help. Even if I can get it fixed or receive a new one, I am sure it will be more of a headache than it is worth. I do not recommend this product to anyone! IT IS HORRIBLE!"
4,Effective. Taste good enough.,They do help with coughing. Having lots of bags is convenient for leaving a stash in the car and at the office.
5,arguably the best tasting and most effective drops available,"I always keep these drops in my EDC bag and at the ready. They provide the most immediate and lasting relief to a soar throat and a persistant light cough that I've ever experienced. The small bit of menthol in each drop is enough to feel the benefit, but does not overwhelm. The combination of honey and herbs is extremely pleasant and very soothing. Highly recommend."
5,soothing and delicious,The best I have found for cough or dry throat problems in the winter. No funny after taste is the best part. They are really soothing and good to keep in your purse or pocket if you are going to be in an audience.
4,"Excellent shape and blue light, but hard to use.","The ""museum"" quality mouse indeed. The color and the shape is awesome. When plugged in, it emits beautiful blue light along the centerline of the mouse. The scroll wheel emits blue light as well. The bottom is sealed so the actual red light optical sensor won't be seen when you use it. It is really the most beautiful mouse I saw in my life, but with some disadvantages:1. It is slightly larger than I thought2. The button is so sensitive that you cannot rest your palm on it. The touch is so light and clickable area is so large, you have to be careful so you finger will not hit the right click button. This is really annoying. I hope it provides a way to adjust the ""tension"" of the buttons, just like the Apple iMac mouse. I feel more confortable using Logitech mouse."
1,worst mouse i've used,"i've owned about 6 different mice up to now and this one is definitely the worst one.its appearance is OK but it really isn't a pleasure to use it. i really would like to return it had i not thrown away all the packages coming with it.as another reviewer said the biggest problem is that the mouse cursor once in a while will jump every where on your screen. for typical usage like editing a file, internet surfing, this isn't a big deal. but it really hurts your game playing. this didn't happen when i just started to use it but it got worse very soon and right now the cursor would behave crazily about every 2 minutes. so don't buy this one."
1,This mouse blows,"I gotta say, the appearance isn't bad and I've had it for a good few years, but it is the worst mouse I've ever owned. When holding it, it isn't terrible, but unless I place it on a plain surface (paper, a folder, or a blank mouse pad) it flies around the screen. Not only that, but if you take a second to read something and keep the mouse in your hand, it takes very little pressure to click in both buttons, so on numerous occasions I've switched windows, started programs, or completely exited out of the internet just because I didn't know exactly where my cursor was on the screen.Bottom line, this mouse sucks and I'd strongly recommend you stay away from it."
1,this sucks!,"I have the coolermaster wave computer case, so this blue light in a mouse seemed like a great compliment to the case lighting.BUT- I can't stand how the mouse jumps all over the page, i have found, though, that if I give it a sudden twist of the wrist, it will spring back into a usable state."
3,"Looks good, performs badly","This mouse is one of the most unique mice I've ever seen. It is extremely stylish, however, there a flaw in the design. The mouse buttons are extremely sensitive to the touch. I find that this mouse is great for use in most business environments; however, if you're a gamer, this is not for you!Personally, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone!"
4,Clarity of vision,"I've kept this book in my permanent library. I'd give it 5 stars, but reading Ellul DOES take one's full concentration! His works are not easy reading, but oh so worth the effort. This man had such profound insight about the way we perceive things vs. what they ACTUALLY do. He saw through so much of the empty reasoning that drives man's rush toward ""efficiency"" and technology. I don't see Ellul as an anarchist but as a man with little time for the multifaceted distraction of falsehood.So few in the newest generation of adults stop to consider that the ease of online ""presence"" is really just a veil for empty relationships. Addressing this same topic, a little fiction book by Stephanie Bennett,Within the Wallsis the first of a series that will hopefully begin to lift that veil for people who are unknowingly trapped behind their technology. If you are an Ellul fan, you might want to give it a read or buy it for someone you know."
3,The Earl Scruggs Revue,"Although better than ""Earl Scruggs And Friends"" This was still a let down for an old country boy like myself."
2,The Earl Scruggs Revue,I was disapointed in this CD! I think Earl Scruggs did himself a disjustice in making this CD with the other people that chose him to help them make a name for themselves!
2,Very Dissapointing,"Years ago, this became one of my all-time favorite albums when I had a copy of it on vinyl. Over the years, it disappeared, so when I saw it available on amazon.com, I decided I needed it for my collection, especially for the Earl Scruggs/Johnny Cash version of ""I Still Miss Someone."" I should have read previous posting...as it the Flatt & Scruggs version of the classic, rather than the Johnny Cash edition of the song, and the audio quality as a whole is questionable. It's sad that Sony Entertainment would let the works of such a legend be treated this way.Hopefully, Mom still has the record up in the attic."
4,Early 70's Bluegrass Folk. These guys can play.,"This is the first CD of the ""Earl Scruggs Revue"" that I've seen anywhere. It is their first album that I am aware of, recorded in 1973. I have eight additional ablums that they did, and I can't wait until they are also released on CD.This ablum sounds like ""Nitty Gritty Dirt Band"" with an edge. Covers of ""Some of Shelly's Blues"" and Dylans's ""It Takes A Lot To Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry"" are excellent. The band later moves off, adding more Rock and Jazz elements in later ablums. Tunes like ""Down In the Flood"" point towards the new direction. ""Station Break"" is worth the whole price of the CD."
4,Worked great.,"Installed this on my 2004 Civic. It wasn't too hard to install. The wires in the car are small gauge though, so that made it more difficult. Good price. Key fobs are solid. Works good."
4,Keyless Entry System,Quality product for the cost. Easy to install with decent instructions. Would recommend for simple installation features for those who want to simply have keyless entry.
3,Easy to install,"This is great because it was easy to install. The price and features are great. The reason it is rated a 3 is because one of the remote isn't working. I have changed the battery on it but it still doesn't work, so I only have the one remote. :("
2,bulldog,"bought this and have yet to install it because of poor instructions for my truck. IF YOU OWN A DODGE, DO NOT PURCHASE. they make you have to buy other parts and relays to make it work properly."
2,Non Functional,"This product did not work for me. I don't know whether it was broken to begin with or if the shippers tossed it around too hard, but I could not get this to work. Pulled apart the door, used a test light to find conductivity, connected power and could trigger the lock and unlock manually, when all put together though neither FOB could trigger the brain. Batteries weren't dead, light up when buttons pushed, even tried the programming for a possible double pulse lock, still to no avail. I'm sure the product works easily if it doesn't arrive broken."
2,The hassle of it all,"I bought this system and paid to have it installed. It sometimes opens the door and sometimes not on my brand new Kia Soul 2012. I tried replacing the batteries at a tune of $7.00 (cause it takes special batteries you can only buy from places like radio shack, of course) So then I called the customer sevice and finally got someone in tech support who told me I needed to look for some special wire and possibly needed a diode and etc... What the hell people!!! When I buy something I just expect it to work.The man at the place I took it too said they no longer carry Bulldog cause of all the problems they were having with them. He said that they were good until some other company bought them out and it has been down hill from there. I wish I knew ahead of time!!! Best of luck if you are aiming to buy American."
1,Bulldog entry system,Very disappointing. I had to pay my mechanic twice to have him figure out that the first system I received was faulty from the factory. I did receive a replacement which works fine. I do not feel I should have to pay my mechanic to find out the quality of the system. Someone should have picked up the tab for the first visit to the mechanic.
4,Works ok for my needs. One of my remotes needs occasional percussive maintenance to work,"The programming instructions for the second remote that came with it are out of date too. To pair it, simply hold the working remote's lock button for 10 seconds (you'll hear the doors lock, and then another lock attempt after 10seconds. Then on the second remote, press and hold lock on that one. Almost instantly, you'll here another lock attempt on the already locked doors. Release the lock button. The second remote is now paired."
3,"Does as it says, but","This product does what it says it will do, but I had to buy an extra module from the installer to make it work with my car. Another 70 bucks. Once intalled it works great."
4,Works as advertised.,"Nothing really exciting to note. The toughest part was finding the correct wires in the car. I installed in a 2002 Honda Accord LX and it was pretty simple. Initially when I put it in using mechanical connections it was doing some pretty weird things, but when I soldered the wires, it started working perfectly. I'll probably end up adding an extra relay to enable flashing lights to confirm because it's really hard to tell if you actually lock the car unless you're standing right next to it."
2,Not too impressed,"Installing the unit is pretty straightforward. However, the parking light confirmation of the lock/unlock function does not work. It is supposed to provide -12VDC current to a relay you have to use with a vehicle that has a +12VDC parking light circuit. The main module is not functioning properly in that it does not provide the -12VDC cycle to trip the relay. I believe I have a defective unit. The frustrating this is that I have left 3 e-mails to Bulldog Security and they have never responded. When I tried calling tech support I got a message saying that they were closed for the day (it was early afternoon on a weekday). I am unimpressed with their lack of response."
4,Works just like you would want,"Not much to say, the bulldog keyless entry works just as it should. The website has wiring diagrams and the instructions are pretty spot on. I learned how to install through a web forum for my car where others had done it, between their write-ups and the product instructions it was pretty easy. I did not use any of the additional features such as parking light flash, and vehicle immobilizer. this adds to the complexity of installation no doubt.I did have to add a small bead of glue to the data board in the control module to keep it from rattling.. remotes seem good quality."
3,Bulldog Keyless entry,This is a very good product and performed as advertised once it was installed. The written instructions are lacking in specificity and I was forced to call customer support to obtain clarification. On the plus side customer support was very responsive.
2,Returned,"This item is porrly produced, comes with awful installation intructions and support. It also appeared that item was already opened when received."
3,take your chances,"I can't honestly say I can recommend ANYTHING from Bulldog. I have had 3, 2 have broken. Supposedly they have a lifetime warranty, but if they never answer the phones, or emails, that's not worth the paper it's printed on. Maybe the price is right, so if you are technical that's a plus, but don't count on any kind of warranty being honored if you have any trouble. Supposedly they were liquidated in May 2007, yet their phones still answer and put you on hold ten minutes. Even stranger, if you try to email their tech support email, it's actually addressed to accounting..."
5,Nice Unit bought on sale for $22!!!,"This is a basic keyless entry system. I would have liked a separate passenger door output and a horn chirp, but I am happy without those two options. Just the door lock/unlock and trunk release are good enough for me. The unit works to about 100 feet for me which is good enough. I used 4 external relays (I'm not a big fan of the small circuit board relays built-in), so hopefully this unit will last awhile. Oh, and I also did NOT hook up the ""starter disable"" feature, because the way I understand it, if you don't unlock the car with the keyless, you can't start the car. I guess that's a good feature for a high theft area, but I live in the sticks with a lower crime rate."
4,Nice pieces for completing a table set,"Sango stoneware has been great for us for everyday use. Good feel with smooth surfaces including the bottom so it doesn't scratch. I've built up a whole collection of Sango Gold Dust after seeing it at Bed Bath and Beyond. Pick up items on sale, no need to pay regular price.This set is a great addition to a more complete collection."
3,Color is not accurately represented,"While I liked the size of the pieces in the Sango Gold Dust Sienna hostess set (they're quite stout) , I'm disappointed in the actual colors. The picture showed a brighter and more vibrant shade of gold/orange and cream. In reality, the colors are nothing like that. They're more subdued earthtones of tan, gray and rust. I checked to see if maybe Amazon sent me the wrong color but the box said it's the right one. Just the same, I'm keeping the set coz my husband likes it."
2,"GEORGIO,GEORGIO,GEORGIO. No more CD's,please.","Now he's done it. Posing like a rapper,he's released an album outside of his roots. Dance/house music. What happened to those house and dance beats of 'SEXAPPEAL'? Because he has traded it for hip-hop beats (he even has a wack rapper rhyming on a couple of tunes and he attempts to rap himself on a few tracks). Was this album meant to stink? RCA Records didn't think so.""Stand"" and ""M.L.K."" has Georgio getting political about African-American pastime telling us to raise up on ""Stand"",praise to a Civil Rights legend in ""M.L.K."" both are actually eye openers to this CD. Without those tunes,this would be considered a VERNON REID solo album (read my review).Other than the hip-hop transformation he still attempting ballads like his hit ""I Don't Want 2 Be Alone"" from his self-titled album but they are not uplifting the CD. The damage is done. Better cop 'SEXAPPEAL'. He is really on PRINCE's tip here."
5,Satisfied,I was glad to receive the cd so quickly and thanks for the nice note and the extra cd that was enclosed as well I appreciate it good doing business with you.
4,works great!,It fit right in to my Brother MFC without difficulty & I was cranking out laser quality output again!
3,Just ok...,"Bought this for use with FiOS. It only works up to 900 MHz, and FiOS needs up to 1 GHz (1000 MHz). Be careful when selecting this for use with certain set top boxes. Other than that, seems to work well. Capped off unused port with 75-Ohm terminators.Received the item very quickly from seller."
1,Seller will not answer my emails,This splitter is not what I needed. I tried to contact seller about returning it and get a refund. They did not answer me. I would never buy from them again.
5,A Genius!,"""Cuando Te Encontre"" is an anthem to those of us who can appreciate the fight and constant struggle of people in need around the globe. Pablo Milanes is a symbol for a lot of people around the world. A true inpiration, poet and singer. Buy this CD."
5,Fabulous!,"this recording really is fabulous. it's nice to hear the variety of voices, and to know that many voice types are able to sing as the phantom. most of the song choices are great, and a couple are so-so, but overall, a great cd to add to your collection."
3,Broadway's Fabulous Phantoms,"It is nice to hear the variety of talented people who have had the starring role in Phantom of the Opera. However, I can't say that I like all of them. Luckily, I saw Kevin Gray who was fabulous."
3,"Limit the bad beat stories, and add more about the internet.","I read the book from front to back, and I was originally very excited about adding this book to my collection of poker books. But as I kept reading, the book seemed to be going on, and on, and on about various bad beat stories (maybe this is a third of the entire book). This wasn't very helpful, nor very positive. It seems that the author ran out of rules to think of (285 listed on the cover) at about half way through the book and started writing about whatever filled his head; this is where the book begins to faulter. What I did like about the book was that it had some internet situations that do occur. For the inexperienced player, this book is probably a good buy at less than $10."
1,I don't like this book.,This book is not that great for the intermediate players. It repeats some of the poits over and over again.
4,Great for what it is,"This helped me shift my game over to a new way of playing. The ideas on what exactly a poker face is, tells, and how to stop from giving those off really changed what I was doing and allowed me to move my game forward. It was the perfect book for me at the time."
4,Life Lessons and Poker,"This book combines philosophy, psychology and poker into an easy to read format that is thought provoking and fun. Does teach a few important lessons to help your game but more so about how to help your life."
5,excellent reference book,"If you like to embroiidery, this is the book. It is a reference book for me because I forget how to do stiches, and the book for sure help me to remember."
3,Embroidery Stiches,I read the reviews of others before I purchased this book and thought I was getting a nice basic book of stiches.I probably could have found a better book for me since I'm just starting with embroidery. It is a nice book though and hopefully will be useful but I do need something more easy to follow.
5,Great for beginners and advanced stitchers,I hadn't touched embroidery for about 40 years and this book is so detailed with TONS of photos that I had no trouble learning lots of new stitches. I took it to work and shared it with two very experienced embroiders and both were very impressed with the variety of stitches presented and the detailed images.
3,Thrill-o-minute romp it isn't...,"Although Barbara Rockefeller's attention to detail and obvious knowledge of the inside world of the life of a stock trader are quite phenomenal, I found the story lacking direction, and the climax weak. The characters of George Soros and Abby Joseph Cohen, for example, are minimally developed at best, and unnecessarily verbose at times. But Rockefeller has most certainly done her homework in terms of setting the stage for her story, an example that more contemporary writers should heed. All in all, however, this was a quite satisfying read!"
5,CNBC is the new authority,"Everywhere I look there is CNBC. Those guys really have their finger on the pulse. In this new book, they're giving you all the inside information and tools you need to be a global investor. There are markets discussed here that I didn't even know were options for me or existed. I was pleased to see the do-it-yourself risk assessment advice. This is the kind of analysis I never thought I could do myself--this book is the only one that tells you what you can and can't do yourself as an individual investor. A great gift, too."
1,lilromeo,he is so kool i mean i cant see why girls dont stick with him insted of bowwow romeo is ssssooooo nifty no one can sayany thing about him ...
1,OK if you like sateen,"I ordered these after searching for NON-SATEEN 100% cotton sheets. I hate sateen, it looks dull and listless after one wash and gets all nasty and fuzzy. Nowhere on the product description does it say that these are sateen, so i ordered two sets. and guess what, they are sateen sheets! And they are no way close in color to that sophisticated gray-green you see here, just the generic pastel green that everyone else has. what a rip off! I am returning them."
1,Very disappointed!,Once washed these sheets were terribly wrinkled. They also feel thin and see-through. I will not buy this product again and I do not recommend anyone else buying this. Who wants to iron their sheets all the time?
1,You Get What You Pay For...,I got these sheets on sale for $19.99. I figured with 300 thread count and 100% cotton with deep pockets it would have been a great deal. But I was disappointed when I opened the package. The sheets were see-thru thin and very obviously cheap. I threw them on the bed anyway and within a couple of days I noticed they started to pill all over the place! Yuk! Thankfully I didn't pay much for them. I guess there are no real bargains out there.
1,NOT what i thought i bought!,"I thought i would be getting nice cotton sheets with a good thread count - instead i got LIME-GREEN SATEEN sheets! i still thought i should give them a try...they were too big for my queen sized mattress, and they stay wrinkled no matter what.if i were you, DON'T buy these - because it is not what you are expecting!"
2,not what I expected,these sheets are soft but very flimsy feeling - too thin of fabric and they do not fit my pillowtop mattress well and just barely cover my standard pillows. I also bought the society hills 400 sheet set and the pillow cases are larger and the fitted sheet is more generous and easier to put on the mattress.
2,Fitted sheet didn't fit,"The color and quality of this sheet set was superb. However, the fitted sheet did not fit. Of course I had just thrown away the packaging and receipt the day before, so returning it is not an option (my fault completely). The tag on the fitted sheet says queen, and it's supposed to fit deep pocket queen mattresses. My mattress is a regular queen one, and it didn't even come close. It could be an isolated flaw, but just be sure to try it on your bed before throwing away the packaging!"
1,sheet set.,These sheets are really bad. The only thing I like is the gold color. They wrinkle terribly when washed and feel like an old worn out rag. The really bad part is that little balls are forming on the fitted sheet. I would never buy these again even if they were half the price I paid.
1,Apparently taupe means greenish-yellow,The color of these sheets is nothing close to the picture. They do not match my comforter set. Lost more color after a single wash in cold water with regular liquid detergent. Threads are also seem coarse for a 300TC set of sheets. They were on clearance...guess I found out why.
4,Comfortable and fits well,"Love these sheets, they are soft and fit well. I just wished they were a little less wrinkly coming out of the dryer"
2,"after 2 washings, they PILL","When you first unwrap these sheets, they look and feel great. But the true test is once they've been washed a few times. They don't hold up AT ALL. They pill after only a couple of washings, and are thin and flimsy. I was really looking forward to giving these a great review, but I can't."
5,These were my first high thread count sheets,I'll never go back to cheap sheets again-you can definately tell a difference. I also thought the price was reasonable.
1,Worst sheets I have ever owned,"Do not waste your money on these sheets even though the price may seem appealing. They came out horribly after only two washings. Pilling, pilling, and pilling, did I say pilling.... Oh Yes! Also, they are very thin or loosely woven (not sure how to explain that) but you can see right through them after the first wash. Very, very poor quality.I do own another set of sheets(500 thread count) from this same manufacturer and am very happy with those though. Just remember the old saying: you get what you pay for and I promise you these sheets are a classic example of that. They are cheap for a reason. I got them for 19.99 but even still, I may as well have just thrown that money in the trashcan since I didn't get much use out of them."
3,"not sage, light green","These were a lighter color than what the photo shows. they're a lot lighter. However, after constant use for six months, the fabric is wearing out. but they were nice and soft at first."
5,Great Fantasy Story!,"This book is filled with magic, fun, and fantsay, three things most preteens can't resist. As an elementary school teacher and mother, I think all kids from 9-13 will enjoy this book. (...)"
4,Scary summer with serpents,"The book I reviewed is Summer of the Sea Serpent by Mary Pope Osborne. I gave this book four stars because it is exciting and mysterious. Jack and Annie, the two main characters, go on another adventure to a land in the sea. Jack and Annie go under water to find a sword. Then they kill a sea serpent to finish off their journey. I would recommend this book to a friend because it is exciting and thrilling. This author has several other books that are great!Emerson, NJ; fifth grade student"
2,A little Scary,"My 4 yr old son and I love reading the tree house books together. We have skipped around in the order, but have read at least 20 or so of the books in the collection--including the ones about Halloween and ghosts. However, for some reason, this one is just too scary for him. He asked me stop reading it to him and we have put the book aside. I am sure older kids would enjoy this and I love the series in general. Parents of young kids may want to wait on reading this one."
4,At it again,"Jack and Annie continue in this wonderful series. We read these books, and listen to them on audio tape and cd - acceptable for the whole family without being boring for the grownups"
5,Magic Tree House,I think all magic tree house books are awsone!!! And that this one will problbily be a good one too.
1,Disappointed!,I was SOO excited that i got my first external hard drive.... the first three or four times... the wire kept slipping out and i thought it was just my fault until i got a different wire and it fits as snug as can be... what a piece of crap! DO NOT buy this..
3,I thought it was white - it's grey,Otherwise it works as advertised but beware this cable is GREY not white. Only letting people know bc I thought the picture was underexposed and this cable was white. It's not white. I kept it anyway...
3,Slips out often,"I typically think Cables to Go products are reasonably good quality, but this FW800 cable is constantly slipping out of the port on my MacBook Pro. Note that the 3' long FW800 cables I have, made by other manufacturers, which include a metal shield on the connector NEVER slip out accidentally, it is only this Cables to Go cables with it's plastic connector and lack of metal sleeve that seems to frequently slip out at the slightest nudge.I've only had them a two weeks so the jury is still out but at this point I might try returning them to Amazon."
2,Very Loose Fit for MacBook Pro,"As other reviewers have written, this cable is not a tight/firm fit in either the current generation MacBook Pro 13.3"" laptop or the previous generation MacBook Pro 13.3"". I ordered the cable to use one time to link the laptops to take advantage of Apple's migratory assistant feature. I am an experienced Apple user. I had an error during the transfer of files, which I am reasonably sure was the fault of the ill fitting cable. If you intend to frequently use the firewire to firewire cable, the ""Cables to Go"" cable is definitely NOT recommended. Try another brand."
1,Very Poor Connectors,"The cable is fine other than very poor connectors. They do not fit very well and slip out extremely easy. If the other device is bumped *AT ALL* the chances are you just disconnected. Yes they fit that poorly. I have two macbooks's a 13"" and a 15"" both 2011 models, I also have been using the cable with an external Rosewill Firewire 800 case. The fit is the same on all devices.I have another external Firewire 800 external, that fits snug.Would only recommend as a last resort..."
5,Great song!,Great song! My favorite verse is This is how it works...you live until you die...Great insights
1,Rip-off,There are only two songs on the CD and for the price it is a total rip-off. This is the first time I have ever been disappointed with a product that I ordered through Amazon!!
4,Interesante historia,"es muy buena y ya es mas larga, pero tiene una parte fuerte, donde va a donde el verdugo que le tiene que cortar la cabeza, eso no me gusto por eso le quite una estrella, hasta una y media deber[ia ser."
5,Fantastic!!!,"I'm surprised that only one person has reviewed this cd...and even more surprised that they didn't love it.I bought this cd in 1999, it was my second Scooter cd (first being No Time To Chill). The funny thing is, I (almost) hated it at first. I liked only 2 tracks...how things do change!This is now my number 1 favourite cd EVER, and the only cd's that come close are other Scooter cd's. It's too bad that Scooter aren't good anymore.In my opinion this is the best techno/dance you will ever hear.If you like happy hardcore, rave, techno, dance or practically any style of music then you will love this.Unfortunately this cd is hard to find but it is absolutely terrific. Each track is a masterpiece created by the genius that was Scooter. They are not anywhere near as good now.I also recommend Scooter - Age of Love and who could forget ""...and the beat goes on!"" and ""Our Happy Hardcore!"
5,Brilliant!,"This book offers a poignant rejoinders to those familiar cliches, which advocate more interventionism on the part of the state in economic and social affairs. Over a hundred cliches are answered from ""We must abide by the majority... thats a democracy"" to the all to familiar ""Pass a law"" cliche. No liberty-loving library should be without a copy of this book. Contributors include a wide spectrum of paleolibertarian, conservative and other thinkers."
1,Warning: This book is disturbing!!!,"I feel compelled to write a review to warn people that this is a pretty disturbing book. I thought the back cover was completely misleading. The book is about cat death - tons and tons of cats die in horrible ways. The descriptions are graphic. There is not a normal relationship between a woman and her cat wherein the woman loves and grieves the cat - it is written with complete emotional distance. If the author wasn't famous for other work I can't imagine any publisher publishing this book. Awful doesn't do it justice. If you want to read about cats dying, written in a completely dispassionate, matter-of-fact, ""oh-well"" way go for it. Otherwise, SKIP THIS BOOK!"
2,Poorly written,This book is poorly written and contains irrelevant information besides from the lack of information. This book is not very useful for college research.
2,Basic Math..not Algebra,"I had to buy this book for my Math 500 class. I am not proficient in math at all. I took Basic Math because I did not want to take Algebra, yet this book uses algebraic methods to even compute the simpliest problems. It has many steps that are dragged out when they could easily be done without algebra. I personally did not care for it at all. had I known the class I chose was using this book I never would have taken it. It is fine for peopke who grasp well the algebraic concept but I, for one, do not. Many people in my class complained to the teacher about the same thing."
3,Not Completely Honest,Seller was not completely honest with this product. Whole book is written in in pencil. The answers. Didn't even bother to erase it. Called it good condition. I found that to be quite an inconvenience. Having to erase an entire book this size?? If I had known would not have purchased. Otherwise book okay but that should have been stated in the ad.
4,fast service,"Because it's a textbook, time was of the essence in delivering and starting to usethe book. The seller really came through; in a couple of days I was sweating through the math problems. Thanks."
4,Basic Mathmatics Text,"Text book is what was required for my class, it was a lot less expensive than the campus bookstore."
3,alright,"This book was great for the price. It was not in as good of condition as I thought it would be, but it was alright. It served it's purpose and that's all I needed. The delivery was fast and I had no problems with receiving it. =0)"
3,Found these titles on netflicks,I was interested in flash card videos for my child so that we could practice to get a solid math base.You can find all these titles on netflick to check out before you decide to buy and keep.ITs about 4.99 for a month of one dvd at a time so not alot of money wasted trying them out.I will post back when I watch them and let you know.I hope this is helpful with saving you some money maybe...........................................I recieved from netflicks.The video includes math facts given with colorful pictures with a male speaking the facts.The video also has just the fact drill and pause for answer to be given by child.My son does not have alot of patience for this type of thing but has done well watching with ear buds .Seems to work and he is learning math facts.
5,This one is different!,"This is not your regular bellydancing dvd, it is more like a bollywood bellydance which is a lot different. I bought it because I have indian friends who got me into bollywood movies and I thought that learning that kinda dance would be cool and different. And it is lots of fun. I haven't done it for a while because I bought their belly dancing dvd which is more fun.So if you are interested in indian bellydancing then this the dvd for you."
1,Embarassing,The DVD cover is misleading - the moves on this DVD are embarrassing. You could never dance in a club with these moves - they are so unattractive. I cant imagine why anyone would want to dance like these twins!
2,not great,"I love bhangra music and dancing- this dvd was very much a teaser... you only learn enough to feel lke you saw a trailer for a workout dvd. There are very brief warm-up and cool-down that (do but) barely use yoga moves. And then three short 3-4 move ""routines"" that definately get you jumping around and work out your back legs well from the jumping but as far as taking them into performance or the dance floor- you probably wouldn't. The workout felt good- my muscles felt really warm and my legs surely received some toning but as I am more interested in dance as an artform as opposed to a mere excercise... this dvd disappointed me. I would recommend instead, The Bollywood Workout. That one again really works the legs and challenges you to let loose and laugh with your whole body- a great workout but feels much more like you just had a dance party. It is more fun and more useful for broadening your dance move vocabulary."
4,ONe of the best,"This CD rocks, best live album the Scorpions have ever or will ever release, put the others to shame. Best songs, including a couple of Elvis songs, from the early years with most of the oringinal group intact. The sound is not of great quality, but does not dimisish the CD in any way, just play it loud. This is a keeper."
3,Scorpions Live,"It's not a bad album at all... but it's not as good as I hoped it would be. But there is something that I must say, there are some true classics here that should be featured in whatever Greatest Hits packages they put together, and they haven't. It's a good album to get if you're interested in the Uli Roth era (great guitarist, by the way!)"
3,Tokyo Trap,"The Scorpions were an okay band in the 70's and this is an okay release. But, it does not, and I repeat, does not measure up to the Scorpions from the Lovedrive album on. Anyone who tells you this... probably also thought the Lawrence Welk rock rocked back then! There is always a minority of people who always try and say that music that did not sell was really great.... and all of us didn't know what we were doing by not buying it. Well, we're still not buying it now. You sub-culture music critics can have your subpar musical efforts and enjoy them along with that 1970's shag carpet that's still in your house. The rest of us will take the supercharged, sonic blasting music of Lovedrive and beyond."
2,NO POLAR NIGHTS ! ?????,ARE YOU KIDDING ME WHAT A JOKE THE BEST SONG FROM TOYKO TAPES IS MISSING ! WHY DID I BUY THIS? POOR EFFORT :(
5,Thier best stuff live,"For me I have always been a little indifferent towards the scorpions until I heard thier 70's stuff and particularlly this album which blew me away. I know most Scorpions fans will prefer the albums and songs that come later, which is fine for them, but for me this is thier masterpiece"
4,Solid album held back by two dead spots,"A good but not great live performance - 3 1/2 stars would actually be the most accurate rating. Two pointless and ear-grating Elvis fillers and a sappy Japanese folk song are the weak points, but overall excellent guitar playing and decent song selection. Recommended if you want to hear Scorps before they sold out with Lovedrive and all their other typically commercial albums from the '80's. Check out UFO's STRANGERS IN THE NIGHT for hard rock's ultimate live album."
1,Could be better,"I was hoping that this one comes with a better presentation, I was specting for a digipak or something like that, this one is a vinyl replica but the vinyl replicas from Iron Maiden are kick ass, this one from scorpions could be better... This is expensive for the presentation... Awful."
1,tokyo tapes,"How could you say this is a complete album without the track ""Polar Nights""? I think this is a rip-off!"
2,NOT THAT GOOD,I AM DISAPPOINTED OF THIS CD BECAUSE FRED HAMMOND AND RFC IS OFF THE CHAIN BUT THIS CD IS NOT. I REALLY WOULDNT RECOMMEND IT BECUASE THEY HAVE DONE BETTER AND THIS CD IS A WASTE OF MONEY. IF YOU STILL WANT TO BUY IT THEN YOU CAN BUT I REALLY DIDNT LIKE IT. THERE WERE SOME SONGS THAT ARE GOOD BUT THE REST ARE WEAK
5,Get your Praise On!,The variety of music is good. This is a pre-cursor to Pages in Life. This is a keeper.
1,This CD is far beneath Hoyt's usual quality.,"Hoyt has had some wonderful hits in his career, like Evangelina, Pancho and Lefty, Hay and Water for My Horses and has also accompanied other stars like Johny Cash. He is not an undiscovered artist. This CD was so bad I tossed it in the dumpster."
1,no help from macscan,"Short and sweet, one day when macscan was updated it thought it was in the demo mode and would turn itself off in 31 days. I tried to follow the instructions for registering to no avail. So i paid for a product i can not use."
1,Don't,"I bought this software after the 30 day demo (which was actually much less than 30 days) was up, back in Jan 2012, I had also used the demo in 2009 and deleted it because it was glitchy. Yeah, you get free updates (which is a confusing download and invoice), but the last one, to version 2.9.4 is still prompting me to put my serial number in to register after I already did and is now again running in demo mode. This is getting really tedious to use and to top it off, now without it, my computer runs slow.You will find that you delete the same tracking cookies over and over. I read a review where someone called it ""bloatware"" and I would agree.My question is, why does it seem this company has a monopoly on the anti-spyware market?(which is the only reason I caved and bought it in the first place).I'd love a refund on this crappy software."
5,Really Easy to Use n.n,"I thought it was so easy to use, I got my mac a year ago and love it more than any computer I've ever been across. This program was so easy to use, I do recommend it, but hey, everyone has a different opinion, if you think it'll be a waste of money, then don't get it. But those tracking cookies get on my nerve lol, so I'm glad to get those out of my sight n.n'"
2,Not revealing,"I was expecting an in depth look at Silva. You get to see some of his values and his family, but not much by way of words from him, most importantly you hear nothing of his martial arts philosophy, only some excerpts of him training. I was dissapointed because I expected to see more philosophy, not just training footage. I really learned nothing new about silva except that he seems to be kind of a jokester with his friends, that's about it."
2,Anderson approved of this?,"I liked the documentary a lot, but the disc itself?! I believe it was a store bought disc and not an actual studio disc before they burned the movie on it. Maybe a Sony or TDK blank. Not sure. This is a Lionsgate product?! I'm disappointed with the actual dvd not the documentary."
2,waste of time,This movie is nothing more than a prolonged episode of UFC Primetime. It's just a bunch of clips of Silva training and some behind the scene stuff of him at press conferences etc. No real story and you learn nothing about him or MMA. A documentary is suppose to enlighten this is just more of the same type of thing I've seen a 100x except I had to pay for it. Boring.
4,Hit and Miss,"This album is a hit and miss effort. Tricky succeeds when his artistic colaborations are with artists whose style complements his own...i.e. with Hawkman, Ambersunshower, and even the Live singer. However, his collaborations with the Chile Peppers don't quite work. Not that they are bad songs, it's just that Tricky's understated, low key musical style and vocal delivery get blown over by the Peppers' manic funk. Those songs should have been saved for the next Chile Peppers album where they would fit in better. Nevertheless, there are a lot of good songs on this album and Tricky's appealing individuality make this album enjoyable to listen to."
2,Blowback Might Just Blow You The Wrong Way,"I first heard Tricky when he did two songs for two of ""The Crow"" movie sountracks. After seeing the video for ""Evolution Revolution Love"", I was interested enough to pick up a copy of the album. What starts off good, with the trippy ""Excess"", and then ""Evolution Revolution Love"", and the Morcheeba-sounding ""Over Me"", soon winds down to track after track of uninteresting songs. I tried and failed to find any other song that could hold my attention. If you do get this album, be prepared to keep the first three songs in rotation, and ""blow"" past the rest."
4,genuinely interesting,"I mostly listen to classical and 50s-60s jazz music, and this CD is my intro to Tricky. I find most pop music boring, predictable, and repetitive, but I really enjoy this... very atmospheric and interesting.I had a very different reaction than another reviewer to the song ""Your Name"": I think it's really touching--it gets stuck in my head and I like having it there. it reminds me of Mo singing with Velvet Underground, kind of.oddly enough, the lyrics to one of the songs (""I believe in buildings tall... I believe disease is coming, I believe that's why I'm running"") gave me such a strong and vivid premonition that 9.11 was like deja vu.the evolution revolution song is great.I have no problem with Tricky wanting radio play. does any musician record songs s/he honestly hopes not many people will listen to?really good record."
2,Sloppy seconds,"2 1/2With his sixth major release, Tricky had officially hammered his own nail on relevancy, offering a luke-warm, seldom effective, and lazily developed foray into grimy pop."
2,"Comment on dit ""panderer?""","Imagine that you're an average low-end hooker, but with one super-hero quality: when a john approaches you, fold of cash in his sweaty hand, you able to transform into an average hooker of any age, race, body type, etc. Wow - you can do anything to get a few bucks out of a guys hand, as long as it's derivative and average!That's Tricky on this decidely mundane genre tour. I'd say stay clear, but if you go, use protection!"
5,SPIN IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN !,"After 99's Juxtapose Tricky's return to form continues with superb Blowback. It's an album of very melodic tunes and catchy rhtymns unlike any other Tricky album.Guests Alanis Morissette, Cyndi Lauper, Ambersunshower and Ed Kowalczyk each done a good job but the real star is Hawkman who turns every track he is on into little masterpieces.Bury the Evidence is an excellent song. The other stand out tracks are Excess, Evolution Revolution Love, Eurythmics sampledYou Don't Wanna,Five Days which features Cyndi Lauper as a nice surprise and the haunting A Song for Yukiko with Japanese spoken-word.If you lost track of Tricky after Pre-Millenium Tension, Blowback is a great piece to welcome him back. Die hard fans are gonna love it anyways.Do yourself a favor and skip tracks 4 and 6. The other 11 tracks are so good you won't miss those two.Brilliant!"
4,leaving paranoia and entering perfection,This album plays like a slow speed highlight and stands out so much from the last two. I found myself drawn in from the first listen and it has since become the soundtrack to my dark and sultry evenings. 'Excess' is just as addictive as 'black steel' and 'evolution revolution love' is just pure beauty. Its worth buying for these alone. 'Something in the way' and 'your name' don't hit the spot for me but add to the 'huh?' effect that trickys work always has. One to put on late late late at night.
1,Cashing in,"After Maxinquaye, I couldn't wait to hear this. Unfortunately I was seriously disappointed.The first problem is that the album differs so radically from Tricky's previous work that it can no longer even be classified as downtempo/Trip Hop. My feeling is that so many big names were brought in on this one (Morissette, Flea, Cyndi Lauper, etc.) that the sound was ruined; too many cooks in the kitchen.The cover of Kurt Cobain's ""Something in the Way"" is so bad it's embarassing.Maybe the next trick will be better."
5,The Book Worm,"The author provides a wonderful and easy to understand ""how to"" treatment of the intergration of technology and business systems. If you're looking to create a workable plan to implement novel and money-making business ideas using technology, this book is a must read. There are a lot of charts, grids, and graphics to help the visual learner."
3,Didn't fully survive shipping,"I bought this and two other glassware sets which all arrived together. Everything was fine except for 2 bowls which had shattered in transit. Can't really say whether it was Amazon's packing or UPS's shipping, but the work involved to have it corrected would have been too much for me.Other than that they are good plain glass bowls."
4,"Nice, Solid Bowls - Clean and Simple","These bowls are very nice, solid, thick, clean, and very simple. They're exactly as you'd expect from the image.However, they are smaller than I imagined. They're 6"" wide, and not all that deep, which is not what I wanted. I returned them, but I don't fault the product for that.If you're looking for a smallish cereal bowl, you'll be happy. If you're looking for a big bowl for some real cereal eating, you'll be hungry."
2,You Get What You Pay For!,"The bowls came - they were cumbersome, and take up a lot of room in cabinet. The glass is very thick, but not quality. Half the bowls came with the rims chipped and still flaking off slivers of glass. The glass of the bowls have a slight green tint. Basically you get what you pay for. For $19.99 for 12 bowls- the price is good, but I was looking for more quality. Since half were chipped, I sent them back to Amazon. They said 'Libbey' brand on them- but they were really made in Mexico. The quality was poor (nothing against Mexico.) I see people rated these well, but honestly, for an established home, I wouldn't bother if I were you."
2,I expect more from an everyday bowl,"A review in short.I purchased 12 of these a couple of years ago. They arrived half broken. Amazon promptly sent me another order. I now had about 18 bowls. They are attractive and great for salads and eating cereal. I like that they are deep so stuff like soup and cereal milk don't slosh out as I balance the bowl on my chest in bed.I am now looking for more bowls as I only have about 6 left. These are not tough bowls and easily break and chip. My mother gave me four glass bowls 20 years ago and I have all four still. Changing environments to be sure, but those four remain unchipped, albeit a bit scratched up, but fully functional. They shared the cupboard with these bowls.These are an everyday kind of bowl and are not sustainable in that fashion. My hunt is on for something more Pyrexy and durable..."
3,Glass Quality,"I ordered these bowls because they had a clean modern feeling and were both dishwasher and microwave safe. I emailed the manufacture to check and they stated they were microwave safe. However, I was disappointed when they arrived because one of them had a very large white inclusion in the middle of the glass. There was also a few others that minor imperfections in the glass. Because the product was relatively cheap for 12 bowls, I decided to just throw away the one with the big white inclusion and keep the rest of the bowls. But the quality is not what I expected."
5,Clear Glass Goes with Everything,"We were concerned about ceramic glazes on our aging, but favorite cereal bowls. We opted to go clear with this glass product, and feel better about heating food in it. They also look good with just about any set of tableware."
5,Love these bowls!,I ordered these a few months ago. They are extremely durable and great quality. They came in packaged perfectly. I have bought many glass bowls over the years that chip easily these haven't yet. Love them!
2,cheap cheap cheap!,"the previous review was right, threads coming out all over, thinnest sheets I have ever seen!, stuffing in the pillows all deformed and lumpy. It is a way to redecorate a room on a budget, but definitely not quality stuff. I am highly pissed that this was a 'gold box' offer and now, a week after, its still at the gold box price... doesn't that defeat the purpose of the term ""gold box"" one day deal?? Shame on Amazon!"
3,Good visual.,Product is very asthetically pleasing. Threads on comforter easily comes off; have experienced several stitches/threads coming off. Be very careful to use this if you have kids that like to use this bed. Perhaps best used in winter as it provides good warmth.
2,"Looks great, feels lousy","It looked great when we got it. Unfortunately, we bought it, put it in storage for 2 months and then took it out when we moved into our new home and were completely underwhelmed.I would've sent it back but too much time had passed. The material was flimsy, the sheets lousy. we never bothered to put up the curtains. Its sad, because the colours are perfect for our room."
1,I had to return it.,"I had to return the set. The bed skirt was 8"" too wide and the sheets were 6"" too narrow. On the bright side, the return was fast and easy and I got the credit quickly."
2,21 Pieces for $100 - Can't Expect Much Quality,"I paid $100 for this item so I didn't expect much quality and I got what I expected. The sheets are thin. The seams on the curtains don't lay flat. The filling in the comforter is bunchy and it's ""dry clean only."" There are lots of loose threads, not from the seams just clipped threads that weren't removed.If you're not expecting high quality, this product will allow you to ""redecorate"" a room for very little money."
5,Perfect,"It arrived on time and it exactly what it says it is. What more could you want?Just a tip: If you're not a big person, the big kid sizes can fit you and save you money."
2,The movie's better,"""Diamond Lil"" was a scandalous Broadway hit for Mae West in 1928. Today it is chiefly known in the even more successful (and now classic) film based on it, ""She Done Him Wrong"" (1933), Cary Grant's first appearance. The play has never been published, either in its original or revised version. But there's the film -- and this novelization. In expanding the story to book length, West and her ghost writer(s) added some period detail (there was a REAL Diamond Lil) and a great deal of padding. A mere curiosity.She Done Him Wrong"
5,Simple,"If you are looking for a straightforward address book that does simply that - organizes your addresses/phone numbers/birthdates, than this is a great program for you! There are no extra bells or whistles, just a simple program to create and organize your addresses. I do like the automatic address label and printing on envelopes feature. Highly recommended for someone looking for a simple easy-to-use program."
5,Simple and easy to use,I was looking for a very simple and easy to manage address book for computer. Stat Address Manager is all that plus produces great reports.
3,Address Manager Software,"Program simple, creates categories easily. It appears you can copy & paste to send emails (however, I haven't tried to do this yet, so I can't say how simple this would be). This program does lack ""check for duplicate record"" option, which can be a problem. Hopefully this will be corrected in future versions.StatTrak Address Manager"
2,Address Manager,"Not real user friendly.I was looking for product similar to ""Parsons Technology Address Book"".Maybe I made the wrong choice.Earl"
4,Easy to use. Good program with one significant problem.,"I've used this software for years. It is very good for managing names and addresses for things like Christmas card label/envelope printing. It has a facility for grouping entries in multiple ways and selecting reports based on the grouping criteria. It's easy to use, has some canned reports that are helpful. You can also create custom reports. However, and this is the significant problem, you cannot save the specifications created for custom reports. Therefore, if you use custom reports you have to reenter all the criteria each time to create the report. I have contacted the developers twice in the past 3 years asking that they add this as an enhancement. They responded quickly and politely saying that they have received this suggestion from other users and may consider it for a future release. I would give this product 5 stars it had the facility to save custom report specs."
1,Forget It,"I got this to replace Parsons Address Book - which was perfect. This was a total waste of money. it is difficult to work with, is not compatiable with Day Timer or Franklin formats to print pages, which Day Timer is all I use. Day Timer no longer has their own software. I have lost my parsons and have searched the web for one. I wasted my money for this. Entering the addresses does not give you anything you want or organize."
3,Address,I purchased it to replace Parsons Techololgy address book 6.0. I do not like it as well as address book 6.0
3,"it will work for me, but not overly impressed.","Loading data from comma-separated-values was slick and easy. The ""address types"" is nice - enabling me to put each address into one or more cataegories. However, overall, I am not terribly impressed with this software. I think the navigation is clumsy. There is a ""copy to clipboard"", but this is not the widely used copy/paste function - there is no way to easily copy address or text from one box, and paste it to another. And the ""notes"" box is too small - it allows multiple lines of entry, but only 2 lines are shown at one time. I might buy this software again, but I would certainly look for alternatives."
5,Ben Tankard is the best Gospel Jazz Pianist Ever!,"I once owned this wonderful CD when it first came out and I am a huge fan of Jazz and Gospel music. When I heard Mr. Tankard's CD, I immediately fell in love with his music. My husband was a skeptic until I played his music and now I have become a collector. I would recommend this CD (and others like it) to everyone."
5,No Great Tartan,"Essential reading for anyone studying anything about Nova Scotia. Work past your assumptions of 'Canada's Ocean Playground' and the people who live there. Clear, concise and often amusing writing elevates this book way beyond dry academic study."
2,Not impressed,"I live in North East PA, and winter lasts 9 months around here. I picked up a pair of these thinking they would be the best. I've tired them twice, and I was very disappointed each time. I found a pair half the price that works twice as good. These seem to be popular, and well promoted, but if you spend time outside, and you do not like being cold, I suggest you pass on these.They washed well, were constructed well, but didn't keep me any warmer then a $10 pair of flannel PJs under a pair of jeans."
3,Miss French to be,This book is an good foray into the French provencial colours and decorating basics. It is lovely to be able to get some insight.
3,"Beautiful colors, plus a jarring note","I ordered this book hoping it would show the true colors of Provence. It does that well in a picture book that captures the feeling and dramatic beauty of this French region, in its ripened exteriors, homey interiors, and rustic artifacts. Perhaps it is just ""me,"" but when I opened the book at random, I was startled and dismayed to see a large photo of a bullfight. While this slice of life may in fact add authenticity in some readers' minds, to me it was so upsetting I am thinking of pasting those two pages together so I can enjoy the rest of the book! If I were browsing a book on the charms of New York City, I wouldn't want to stumble across a photo of a dog fight. There is a place for everything, and I don't think animal cruelty is what the typical decorating book lover hopes to discover in a pretty volume of this sort, even though it may, like the beheading of chickens, be a commonplace in this part of the world."
3,Not a Pride & Prejudice movie,"I am giving this movie 3 stars because though it has a stellar cast I thought the story line was sort of bleh. Acting was excellent, don't get me wrong, its just not what I expected and the ending, in my opinion was horrible!!"
3,Age of Innocence,"Silly ""period"" movie. Bought it because RSL is in it.Service from vendor was quick and competent."
2,Potentially interesting story...but why can't anyone act??,"The set design and costumes were lovely, but the actors were just horrible. Daniel Day-Lewis is usually outstanding but even he can't bring life to this role. Of course, you can't blame him for not loving the always annoying Wynonna Ryder...but how could he choose the histrionic and insipid Michelle Pfeiffer, who doesn't begin to do justice to Countess Olenska? Her red eyes and her heaving bosom have gotten tiresome (here as in Dangerous Liasons)...Not to mention the narration...thanks Joanne...you're the best...but why not just do the audio instead of this annoying voice over."
2,does not wear well,"The sets and costumes are great; but this is a leaden production. Daniel Day Lewis turns in a wooden performance and the narration is irritating. Day Lewis's American accent is an embarrassment. Winona Ryder does well (especially in the last hour) with a thankless part; and Michelle Pfeiffer saves this movie from utter tediousness. Very disappointing, considering the undeserved praise it has received."
2,Boring Movie,This was a boring movie. I couldn't get into into. The story line is dragging throughout the whole movie. I saved it on my dvr because I thought it was worth while looking. I wouldn't recommend anyone on buying this movie.
1,Director ruins good film,"I actually agree with many of the comments of the previous reviewers. The camera work is excellent, the story is good and the acting as well. The visual storytelling is beautifully done, so why does Scorsese have to ruin it all by letting a voice-over explain everything which the images had already conveyed? Doesn't he believe that the audience is capable of thinking? Apparently not because near the end he had to make a flash back to that pivotal beach scene where Pfeiffers character did not turn around. Only this time she does turn around, thereby indicating with the subtlety of a highway billboard that if only she would turn up in the window (which we all know she won't) things may end happily. Please Mr. Scorsese, do have more respect for your audience in the future."
1,The Age of Boredom,"Martin Scorsese, usually a brilliant film-maker, has broken the cardinal rule of film-making: Thou Shall Not Bore the Audience.This film is excruciatingly boring. There's no other way to state it. The pacing is slow, the dialogue without emotion, the story is thin and lifeless. Although beautifully filmed at times (check out the ornate dinner parties), and the actors appear competent, if not comfortable in their roles, there is no disguising that in this film, nothing happens. Nothing.I have no problem with deliberately paced films with similar story lines, such as The Remains of the Day. However, with The Age of Innocence, the sum of the parts is significantly less than zero. A complete waste of two hours of my life."
3,"3 and a half, actually...","This is a visually opulent movie! Very beautiful costumes and solid performances, but I do have to agree with one of the the other reviewers about the dialogue. (see Stiffled Characters, a viewer from HI) Some of it made the movie feel a bit like a caricature of Victorian era life as opposed to an authentic example of it. BUT, it is worth seeing just for the scene in the carriage between Daniel Day-Lewis and Michelle Pfiffer! I won't spoil it, but it involves her glove and it has to be one of the most erotic moments in modern cinematic history, especially since they are both fully clothed! All in all, a worthy choice."
4,Beautiful Craftsmanship,"Martin Scorsese has given many different genres a shot, and many viewers thought that he was dreadfully out of place crafting a costume piece. But, Scorsese injected more elegance and greater visual flair into this film than any director has into a fancy-pants effort. On lush visuals alone, the film is worth looking at again."
2,Miscast characters,"Even though this was directed by Martin Scorsese, the film missed the book because the casting was all wrong.If you loved the book you couldn't see Winona Rider as May. May was tall and blonde and athletic looking with pale blueeyes. The Ellen character in the book is described as a small ""dark lady, pale and dark"" &"" with ""brown hair in close curls"" andhere's Michelle Pfeiffer in all her blonde abundance playing Ellen! It bothered me a lot. Daniel Day-Lewis was good asArcher; and the last important scene was played very well but over all it was a disappointment."
3,Stiffled Characters,"Overall quite an impressive film. There were a few problems which persisted throughout this film that really, well, bluntly, bugged me. The characters were very cold, the dialogue was spoken with indifference. Don't know if that's what they were going for but just didn't work for me.Another thing: the dialogue itself. Just about every 15 minutes, person #1 would ask person #2 a question, person #2 would repeat the question's last word as a question.FOR EXAMPLE:Person #1-""What about the patent?""Person #2-""Patent?""That grilled me to no end; this type of speech would occur much too frequently throughout the film, and just about every character did this. In contrast, however, the music was perfectly fitting with the scenes and the settings were gorgeous, really brought out the time period. Great film and all, but I wouldn't buy a copy for myself."
4,The Age of Innocence,"A novel by Edith Wharton about old New York and its unwritten rules of behavior for a certain class structure. Faithful adherence to the novel, good acting, and setting. The parts played by Michelle Pfeiffer and Winona Ryder really should be exchanged one for another with respect to their physical attributes as described by Wharton, but since the actresses are who they are, the discrepancy can be passed over."
1,Pure Torture!!,"At first, I thought that this was a horror movie. This nerve racking atrocity distrubs me. The director is calculating and cruel."
3,So So,I think you had to have read the book first to enjoy this movie. I searched for the big prize winning book within it and didn't find it. I was bored.
2,really boring,"This movie was based on a book by Edith Warton. I liked Enya's song in the one part of the movie, but the story I thought was very shallow because everyone was so obsessed with being proper and rich. Some of the food looked good, but I got sick of seeing all of the cups and saucers and plates and watching men clipping and smoking their cigars. Everybody was always feeling sorry for themselves, and they all had too much to be feeling sorry for themselves. It drove me crazy. I liked Winona Ryder in Little Women."
3,A Film Of Rare Beauty,"Martin Scorsese's talents shine very clearly in this movie, as it remains, to me anyway, as one of his best films! It's a movied filled with beauty from every aspect: the acting, the directing,the music, the screenplay,and the cinematography. Everything is stunningly perfect in this film. Martin Scorsese is a director of rare talent, and was unrightly over looked for an Oscar nomination for this movie. Luckily the Academy didn't over look Winona Ryder in this movie, as her performance is one of the many reasons to watch this movie, which is based on Edit Wharton's novel of the same title. Michelle Pfeiffer, in my opinion delievers her best performance to date! This is a movie where one doesn't have to be a Scorsese fan to enjoy it. All you have to do is sit down and relax and watch this modern masterpiece."
3,"GREAT NOVEL,SO SO MOVIE","EDITH WHARTON's wonderful novel is certainly good looking on the screen ,but it is a misfire most of the time,because we simply can't feel anything for those characters.One must salute SCORSESE for trying something different ,but this is simply not his cup of tea.Actors in general are not to blame,especially MICHELE PFEIFFER who tries to inject some vitality to her character.DAY-LEWIS is incredibly stiff and so is RYDER as gorgeous as she is.If you read most of WHARTON's novels, you know most of her men are boring characters except in THE HOUSE OF MIRTH.Fortunally for us, an adaptation of this novel is due soon."
4,The Age of Innocence,I thought this movie was good. Reminded me of Martin new movie Gangs of NEw York with Leo. But that was in my opinion since he used the same backdrop which is almost for all his movies. I wonder how he would for something else not in NEw York. THe respention of social pressure or society was right on. The society was reflect though visuals that were stunning. THe riches and grandiose style. it was a good movie better if Ellen and Newland gave into their passion but the sexual tension is what drove the film.
5,One of Scorsese's best,"A number of months ago I sat in a darkened theatre and watched Brokeback Mountain. While I thought the film was quite good (certainly better than Crash), I couldn't help but feel like I had seen this story done before, but much more effectively. Of course, I had, and that was in Martin Scorsese's adaptation of Edith Wharton's lovely novel. Both Brokeback Mountain and The Age of Innocence deal with the struggles that people make to break free from society's suffocating grasp, and in both cases true love is turned away in exchange for societal acceptance. Yet, The Age of Innocence doesn't resort to the cop-out that Brokeback Mountain does (*spoilers*: Jack Twist being martyred). Rather, The Age of Innocence offers a much more painful outcome: living the rest of your life knowing that the one person you love is within reach, but choosing to remember her as she was and living out your life in solitude. This film is one of the absolute best films of the 1990s."
1,Age of innocence,I never saw it because it wouldn't download. Amazon is difficult to use with Roku. Got more to go to get it functioning.
5,Wonderful period piece - very enjoyable,I had this movie on video tape... just wanted to own the dvd as well. This is a really wonderful movie
3,I like this..but find it irritating....,"I basically purchased this movie...and a million others that are similar, because I loooove stories that are set within this time period. Just like anyone, I love a good romance...and the way this movie was shot was breathtaking, but...Daniel Day Lewis annoys the [heck] out of me!!! Are we actually suppose to feel sorry for him??? He doesnt even try to pretend that hes not in love with his wife...and its his own fault!!! The ending left me wanting to scream in frustration...what can I say?..I like to walk away from a movie feeling satisfied...and this movie left me feeling distinctly empty."
3,The age of Innocence,it was ok.... nothing thrilling... basic movie pretty nice to watch old time just your good old movie the old time movie is good
1,Terrible Casting,"Terribly disappointed in this film. I love period dramas, Daniel Day-Lewis and Martin Scorcese. However, the film was ruined for me by the atrocious performances of both Michelle Pfeiffer and Winona Ryder. Ryder couldn't act her way out of a paper-bag...and somehow they managed to make Pfeiffer unattractive. They were both just obviously out of their league - put into stark contract by the talented Joanne Woodward's lovely narration.The Age of Innocence"
4,WISH THERE WERE MORE LIKE THIS,"I LOVE THIS PRODUCTION FOR IT'S OWN SAKE BUT ALSO BECAUSE IT HAS TEACHING/LEARNING VALUE IN GIVING US AN HISTORICAL INSIGHT INTO HOW FAST CULTURE AND VALUES CAN, AND DO CHANGE. ALSO, WITH THE DEARTH OF REAL DIALOGUE FILMS TODAY (EVERYTHING IS ANIMATED, OR ONLY ACTION BASED) THIS IS A TREAT FOR THE BRAIN."
3,DDL looks perfect but I was bored,DDL is one of the best actors in the world and this movie I think is intentionally ABOUT being technically perfect but chemistry-free by actually being technically perfect and chemistry free. This movie made me think (1) who in their right mind would want to be a part of NY society if you weren't born into it and (2) brownstone living is an outmoded style of housing in NYC and we should probably tear them down and build better buildings but keep their interesting old facades because they hold such Sidewalks of New York nostalgia for everyone. I feel that everyone should watch this movie once for informational purposes but I wouldn't recommend it for pleasure.
4,Such a beautiful film...,"I really enjoyed this movie. I watched it after I read the novel and it really made it come to life before my eyes. They story's wonderful, of course, but I really loved the intricate costumes and lavish sets."
5,Ben Tankard Sunday Drivin,One of his best CD's I would highly recommend this CD if you like Ben Tankard. Really mellow smooth jazz.
1,leospirit,"Actually...I'd give it 0 stars. Read the ingredients!! Would you want to actually soak in this stuff? You absorb so much through the pores of your skin when bathing. Do yourself a favor...get some real, high quality essential oils. Ylang Ylang oil from Young Living, for example. It's wonderful!! Just add some drops to the bath water. These are oils proven to have very high vibrational frequency to them...and you can definitely feel the difference!! Anything that has ""perfume"" on the label is nothing more than a synthetic chemical ""smell"" and nothing like the real deal!!"
2,Too much.,"I dropped this bath bomb in the tub on my birthday, and it made me laugh. It filled my bathroom with a noxious cheap perfume scent that friends commented on for DAYS, made my tub greasy and bright pink, and it irritated the hell out of my girlparts. Won't be using this one again. The first star is for the random squishy flower that came out of the bomb and floated around in the water. The second star is for the buttercream and the soap samples that came with it."
2,That's it.,"Yes, my bath smelled good and was a pretty color, but this is a waste of money. Costs too much for what you get. Better to stick with the Bubble Bars. They're pricey too, but you do get several uses out of them."
2,Not what I expected,"I was so excited when I ordered the bath bomb(s) from Lush. I am a bath fanatic. After the stress of kids and family, there is nothing I enjoy more than a hot bath and a book. I settle in for an hour at least. So imagine my let down. I had read all the wonderful reviews and was looking forward to using them (I ordered a few different ones). I can not even tell you my disappointment when I took my first bath. The smell is one of my favorite things about bath bombs and bubble bath but these lacked that. With the bombs they also sent me samples of their soap - I do not recommend that either, even my children didn't like the smell! I will not be ordering from them again."
3,It was nice but...,I really liked this product but didn't like that it seems to be something you only use once. As soon as I put it in the tub it started to melt very quickly. That seems a bit extreme for the price of it. Much smaller ones should be made and in packs so that you can have one to put in the tub when you want to and it wouldn't be too much. I think one whole large one is too much for one bath. There also should be instructions with their products. I noticed a lot of their items do not have any.
2,JUST A SODA BALL,Dissapointed ..this ugly soda ball makes my skin very dry..people be aware dont buy it ...i buoght two pieces used one and sure will throw one ...ugly ball
5,WISH I COULD EAT IT,"This is by far my favorite thing in the world, I don't purchase bath bombs that don't produce bubbles because I love them so, but i have read so many awesome reviews on this I figured I would try it. The smell is divine, the smell lasts through out the next day. I did try to break this bomb in half then tried to cut it didn't work....just toss the whole thing in your bath its amazing."
3,Lovely.,"I thought this particular bath bomb was very lovely. It definately leaves a nice scent on your skin. Kind of a musky smell. You can definitely smell the Lavander. Not sure why it's named the way it is, it wasn't particularly sexy to me but it is still very lovely and seems to be a pretty hot item; I went to order more and they were out of stock."
2,Not so sexy...,"This bath bomb is just ""meh"" for me. I have used several of them and every time I keep hoping that it'll just be an amazing experience but really, after the fizz dies down, you're left with colored water and some random stuff floating around. The scent is a little overpowering in the tub, but it doesn't stay on my skin very well. If I'm going to take a $5.00 bath, I would much rather use one of Lush's bath melts...they leave your skin feeling much softer than the bombs and tend to smell better too."
2,Stained the tub,"I like Lush products, but the dye in this one was way too potent. Weeks have gone by and I still can't get the pink stains off the bathtub, even with softscrub.Try the Butterball bath bomb instead - it feels sublime, and melts away stress without staining the tub."
5,Absolutely Wonderful,"I first tried LUSH when I lived in England. I saw a shop and was curious about it and went in. My first reaction was WOW, the shop smelled FANTASTIC!! I starting buying all kinds of LUSH Products from then! My favorites and staples in my house are Sex Bomb, Floating Island, Ceriwen's Cauldren, Creamed Almond and Coconut Smoothie, Honey I Washed The Kids Soap, King of Skin, Buffy The Backside Slayer, and a few others. LUSH has to be one of my favorite stores!! Since there is only one shop in the US and that's far away from me I usually have my friends in England ship me some LUSH goodies and I ship them some American goodies!! We love our exchanges and I get all my favorites!! If you have yet to try LUSH I recommended it!!"
3,Smell too strong...friend really liked it tho',"I bought this as s stocking stuffer for my roomate and while she loved it, the smell was overwhelming for me. It permeated the entire house and I have a pretty good sized place. For what it's worth, she did say it left her skin feeling really smooth. But she agreed that the smell was overpowering at first for her as well. If you have asthma, you might want to skip this kind of scent."
2,Just 'meh',"I have tried 4 bath bombs from Lush. Each one has disappointed me. While the scents range from 'ok' to 'really good', the bombs fizz out in under 5 minutes and leave massive amounts of *navy blue* grit in the bottom of the tub (no matter the type of bomb). This is not fun to clean at the end of a relaxing bath. I've also been turned off by the heavy staining characteristics of the bath bombs. If they lasted longer and left my skin feeling more moisturized instead of dessicated, I'd be more forgiving of it. Bath bombs are mostly scent-infused baking soda. Big deal.If you're looking for something that gives lots of bubbles, more pampering for your skin and amazing scents, go for the bubble bars and bath melts by Lush. You'll have some grit in the bottom of your tub afterward, but the trade-off is a longer-lasting, better product."
3,A Painful but Informative Read,"If you can overlook Checkett's cheerleader narrative, shameless book plugs, and the lame (and seemingly desperate) attempts to develop catch phrases, then you will find a lot of very useful information concerning customer service. Checkett's does touch on the importance of technology, treating your employees as ""internal customers"", and it's relationship with customer service but I don't think the point was stressed enough. My guess is because it's an involved and alienating subject but nevertheless the information the book did provide was worth the painful read."
5,Very Nice Photo Printer,I was amazed by how well it did a scanned photo on photo paper right from the box.
3,Great printer but it's too old to buy today,"This is a great printer but it's too old to buy today.The problem is that the print head will clog. It's not a matter of if, but when it will clog. When this happens you'll need to buy an eighty dollar print head. Unlike Epson and other printers this print head doesn't last very long.Please investigate a new model instead of getting this old model.There is a good chance that any model, even if new/old stock, when bought at this date will have a clogged print head that cannot be repaired. I've done all the remedies for clogged print heads, including hot water and solvents, to no avail.Oddly enough, I have an even older Epson C42UX and it works fine after being neglected for almost a decade. Canon should give Epson a call and see how they do it."
5,GOOD PRINTER FROM CANON,"Have had this printer for a year or so now. It is very good, the cartridges are very easy to refill. Has individual color ink tanks unlike HP printers. So it is very easy to work with. Makes nice color pictures and good B&W printing, fast. I would recommend it."
2,"Love Canon Products, But not this one.","I love canon products and I own a scanner, two printers a digital camera. Ok here's the problem with this printer. First of all it messed up after i replaced the ink cartriges for the third time. Now everything prints with a yellow tint. I cleaned the print head and deep cleaned umpteen times no luck.The other problem is it really uses up the ink. It has 3 color tanks that are said to last longer, but once one goes the other two are right behind them. My recomendation is the canon Ip 1500 it prints pictures as good as the ip3000. The nice thing one black and one color cartridge that you can get on the web for less then ten bucks for both. Also they are very easy to refill. I can not see the difference between print quality with the ip3000 and the ip15000. Canon does make great products and hasexcellent customer service. I do alot of printing and tried hp, epson, lexmark but Canon is the best and has the cheapest cartrides."
2,Don't Pay For This,"I received this unit for free when I purchased my laptop. ""Why would anybody give away a perfectly good printer,"" I thought. After using it I i quickly realized why the store couldn't wait to get rid of them. This unit is no good for the regular, digital picture enthusiast. Why? It utilizes CMYK. This means that all of your photos have to be converted and even then they won't hardly resemble the colors on your monitor. Only design nerds and professionals use CMYK and that's for printing jobs. As well, the lines per inch (lpi) is severely out of whack with my unit. I have to finagle everything I do in Photoshop to a great degree in order to avoid having vertical streaks on my prints.Even if my unit has some strange quirks that others don't, I highly advise the regular user to stay away due to the CMYK cartridges (which are also more expensive than say HP's). 2 stars out of 5"
5,Wonderful printer,"Despite being probably the cheapest printer I have ever bought, it is definitely the best! (...)Don't let the ugly-duckling looks put you off.Printing of text and photos is blazingly fast. It must be 3 or 4 times faster than my old Epson Photo 925. It has both a paper hopper on top, and a paper tray. You can stick photo paper in the tray, and leave plain paper up top. The tray also makes it easy to print on small paper, like 4x6"".Leave both hopper and tray loaded, and print from the hopper with your normal apps, using the included photo printer application to print to the tray. It's all pretty fool-proof.Photo quality is superb. I hadn't expected that. It's literally indistinguishable from what you get at a photo shop. But the speed and quietness of printing are equally impressive.The front paper exit door can be closed when not in used, reducing the footprint somewhat. The nicest, most trouble-free printer I've ever owned. Amazing."
5,Best Printer I Have Ever Owned,"This printer is compact yet useful, as well as easy to set up. Prints quickly with excellent results, even on photo quality. You can use the paper tray or manually feed paper, a nice option many other printers lack. Seperate ink cartidges are a HUGE improvement over the all-in-one color cartridge. The ink cartirdges that come with the printer are actually FULL, unlike the 10% full ones that other printers come with.Only complaint is that the entire printer industry thinks that I have an abundance of extra printer cords laying around and they dont need to include them in the box. This is the case with every other printer as well, so dont hold it against this one.After going through 6-8 printers before this one, I think I have finally found a printer that I am actually happy with instead of the ""I guess this one will work"" printers I have had in the past."
5,Fantastic,"Bought it to be a printer for documents and such, that said I was amazed at its photo quality printing."
5,Excellent Printer,"Great Prints - all kinds of paper. Printing on both sides is awesome! Ink cartridges are cheap to buy, it almost doesn't pay to re-fill - but I do anyway."
2,Canon Rebate Scam,"I ordered this printer along with an iBook G4 expecting to receive a $70 rebate for the printer. Well, it took an extra month to receive my printer. Then, they sent me only $20 in rebate.I called them and asked for assistance but none of their departments have communication with eachother. I've already re-faxed my information twice but the 'override' department can't get those documents from the rebate department. So now I have to spend another $5 faxing the same five pages to the same company.Don't expect good service from this company."
1,I couldn't install the driver,"I couldn't install the driver on my laptop. I searched on the internet and asked the Canon company service through phone, so far I still couldn't install it yet. It seemed that a lot of people had similar problem with Canon printers (maybe with other brands too). So the print quality is poor probably because I couldn't adjust it (the printer is supposed to be calibrated after installing the driver).The process to make the installation work was really frustrated."
1,Printer DOA,"The printer arrived with Amazon's usual good service, but the printer is unusable. The printer refuses to print without the inner door shut... even though the inner door is as shut as it can get.Having said that, Canon have just agreed to send out a new printer, gratis. :-(UPDATE: The second printer died six months later; Canon agreed to send out yet another printer. I'm torn between being peeved with the low robustness of the printer and marvelling at their customer service. I still wouldn't buy this printer again."
4,"Great printer, no complaints.","This printer does an excellent job, esp with high-quality paper, on documents and an equally fine job on photos. I have used it to turn several so-so color photos into beautiful bordered B&W prints. Worked with my PC and now works with my Mac, no problems at all."
5,"Great printer with ""hidden features""","I purchased an ip3000 when my i550 died (thought I was saving money using generic inks, and it cost me a new printer). Photo printouts are superb (8x10's look fantastic!) Speedy, decent black prints.Two things of note: it is possible to ""modify"" this printer to print on printable CD and DVD discs! Also, you can save money by printing in grayscale - but you *must* use the wizard to get blac-ink only in draft mode. And yes, it is fast!"
5,Very Impressed,I just received this printer a week ago and couldn't be happier. Text quality excellent and very decent photo printing. Fast compared to my HP 680 and quiet too. Double sided (duplex) printing works suprisingly well. 4 ink tank system a great idea to reduce ink costs. Setup very easy. Amazing performance given how inexpensive a printer it is.
1,The little engine that could....then DIDN'T!,"I've owned this printer for probablly a year now and now I'm shopping for a new one!! Why can't Canon get it in their head to put the print head on the ink cartridge itself like HP does (who's printers I'm now reviewing)...then maybe you wouldn't have the problem of your print head wearing out and clogging like I did. Oh and did I mention it costs about $85 for a new print head,...yeah that's what I said! Don't get me wrong...the printer did great for the time I had it...excellent prints and everything but to only last a year (if it's even been that long)...I'm quite disappointed. So my search is on."
3,Perfect for only some people,"This is a sweet printer in most ways. The paper handling is great, the image quality is great, it is fast, and the ink is a resonable price.The downside? If you are thinking about using Linux even a little, ignore Canon Printers. The support is nonexistant. (I recently switched, and everything works great EXCEPT this printer. My HP works fine)"
1,Fine Printer When New but WILL NOT LAST!,"I should have learned my lesson with my first Canon printer. Unfortunately I replaced it with this ip3000 model. It will not last! The paper feed mechanism will soon go bad. Mine fed paper in at an angle, grabbing it on the right side and ripping it apart. After too many hours of research and dickering, I simple annihilated it into with the largest hammer I have! I must have thrown over fifty pieces into the garbage. The problems with this printer are well documented on the internet despite positive feedback here on Amazon. I will NEVER buy another Canon product again. NEVER!!!"
1,Waste of Money!,"I had this printer less than a year and used it primarily for printing documents. My daughter was born on November 1st and I tried printing pictures on photo paper and the color didn't print right. So I thought it was time for new color ink. Bought Staples brand photo ink, about $50.00,(replaced all colors, go figure there is no such thing as photo yellow) and it still doesn't print properly. Now I am out $50.00 in ink. I took out and cleaned the print head and it still sucks. I am very disappointed in this printer and will probably never buy another Canon again!"
3,It was good until...,"The printer head clogged. Now my printer is ruined. It prints everything with pink lines through it. I'm probably going to try my luck with printing photos at CVS or something.Warning to Canon PIXMA users, DO NOT USE IMITATION INK! I made a mistake and bought Staples brand cartridges, after that the thing clogged and even after spending more money replacing the damn things, it's still messed up. I don't know how much a printer head costs but probably for the same price I could get myself another printer.From reading everyone else's reviews, I will probably stray away from Canon printers :( Maybe I'll try my luck with HP, because my previous one never let me down like this...which is a shame, because when it was working, it printed beautiful photos."
3,Canon's dont last,"This is the 3rd Canon printer I have bought in just over 3 years and it is the last time I will ever buy one. At just over one year of owning each printer, I had different problems with each one, too expensive to repair, so ended up just buying another. But after this one, I will never buy another Canon. They work well for about a year, but after that they quit running. I used to have high regards for Canon products and I always bought one because of the multiple inket refills but it is worthless to me if I have to buy another every year and just after the warranty runs out."
2,Ink Hungry Vampire,"The print quality of this low priced printer is great. But, and this is a BIG but, it sucks ink like a blood thirsty vampire, it seems to drain all ink colors reguardless of weather the picture requires it or not seeming to evaporate without cause. I stocked up on some budget ink cartridges from an online store and the amount of printing I've done compared to how many ink cartridges I've used make this printer anything but economical."
2,"Read The Prince, Not Cliffs Notes","Stacy Magendanz throws Machiavelli under the bus with this interpretation of The Prince. The summary's subjective stance is far worse than anything Machiavelli cooked up himself as it condemns free enterprise and personal ambition. What Stacy does get right, is the book's four distinct pathways to acquiring leadership, but goes onto suggest that Machiavelli believes all should be fused together into a hyper-idealized totalitarian despot. If this were the case, then all mega-corporations would be headed by bloodthirsty Adolf Hitler clones. Don't read anyone else's write-up about this book. ReadThe Prince (Dover Thrift Editions)for yourself and learn to separate the good from the bad."
5,Great documentary. An inspiration.,I used this video in a workshop with at-risk youth and they really responded to it. There is an online curriculum for the film that you can print off and it really gets young men and women of the future (HS level) engaged. Highly recommend!
1,Incoherent distortion of the Blue Cliff Record,"This book shows what you get if you take a coherent and challenging Zen classic and slice and dice it and distort it willy nilly to fit some sentimental New Age preconceptions of what is ""spiritual.""If this writer had any inkling of Zen, he would not dream of treating a classic expression of the teaching like the Blue Cliff Record in such a cavalier way.Maybe the writer should ponder a Zen saying: ""I would rather suffer the torments of uninterrupted hell, than to portray Zen as mere sentimentality and blind people's eyes."""
1,Not a particulary good book for someone interested in zen,"First of all, this book doesn't contain any translation of the blue cliff record, so if you buy just it and don't have a translation of it, you will be lost as to what the autor is talking about.And the author just made up some poetry about what he read in each of the hundred cases of the blue cliff record, poetry that doesn't seem particulary significant from the point of view of zen. After all, the blue cliff record is a book about zen.If you are interested in zen (I don't know why would you buy the blue cliff record if you weren't), don't buy this book. Buy instead either Thomas cleary's translation or katsuki sekida's translation with comentary of the blue cliff record, or both."
5,The better RAGE DVD,"Now this DVD of rage is tight. You get to see everything live, and the early videos of rage. none of the battle of la or renegades songs are on there, but the previous songs are so good that you won't even notice, and also you see exactly why they are called RAGE against the machine. Zack's unbridled energy on stage along with Tom's guitarwork is just beautiful to watch. You just have to see it."
5,WOW!!! VERY VERY GOOD!!!,"This is so great!. Incredible, everything you would expect from this high quality band. good footage combined with zach and the gang's awesome stage presence make for one heckuva video! also very nice to see UNCENSORED (oh my...) videos you simply WILL NOT see anywhere else. especially on the Mindless Total Vegi-head channel (AKA MTV)!"
5,The Battle Of America,"this is a good video. I love rage concerts so i decided to buy this video, from then on i keep watching it. All the songs live rock, and it looks like a brawl for all concert. Get this video if you like rage and their concerts. PLUS theirs a cd single that comes with the video."
3,Music great as usual - but video makes for a headache,"Well, the audio quality is about all this DVD has going for it. I would actually prefer just to listen to their CD's. The video portion is choppy, low-quality, and poorly put together. I get sick of watching some of it after 5 minutes, so I just listen to it while it plays in the background on my computer. The ""Uncensored"" portions of this DVD are hardly interesting or even remotely cool. My final word: But their CD's, not their DVD's."
2,"Come on, Please!","This could have been so much better. The sound on the live tracks is not that good. I am a huge ratm fan so I had to own it good or bad, it is worth the money but seriously this could have been so much better. It includes no tracks from battle of LA, It is a must for rage fans but could have been so much better by waiting for some more material to put on there. I would have liked to see some other songs live but its like a settle for what you paid for thing. But worth the money"
5,Zack for President,Vintage footage. I like the way there were snippets of different performances. I think the collaboration flows nicely. My favorite part is the elderly woman introducing the band! I am thinking about writing Zack DeLaRocha on the ballot for the 2012 presidency. He seems to have his heart in the right place.
3,Could have been better,"I am a huge R.A.T.M. fan. I love pretty much anything they do but I still believe this DVD was put together pretty poorly. The live recordings dont capture the power and the adrenaline rush you get from actually seeing the band live, and the sound on the live tracks is not very good. Also, Rage has a large arsenal of amazing songs yet this DVD repeats some songs twice instead of giving you a wider range of songs. One good thing is that you can view the lyrics to the songs as zack sings. If your a BIG rage fan you'll like it because its Rage, But in conclusion the DVD does not acurrately represent the band and the emotion level they play with live."
4,Pretty good,It's not as good as there actual concerts. The power of the music isn't exactly shown and the sound quality isn't all that good. But it is a great colloection of concert footage. And the videos it shows are awesome.
5,Lyrics on the screen,Having the lyrics on the screen (subtitles) was a wonderful plus. This band has something to say. And watching Zack De La Rocha using his wonderful energy to put important ideas into poetry is a greast use of the DVD medium.
5,The guitar god is back,"I bought this video the day it came out (nov. 27, 1997) and I watched it everyday for the next 5 months, sometimes twice a day. This is unreal. I do wish they had more backstage interviews with the band, but this is still unreal. The live footage gives the viewer a true sense of what it is like to be at a rage concert. You are gonna want to get up and mosh in your living room when you are watching this. And Morello's guitar playing will make your jaw drop. Keep your eyes peeled during the guitar solo on ""Bullet in the Head."" You won't believe how Tom gets his guitar to make those sounds."
1,marketing w/powerweb,I ordered a new book. The book was not new and was a little dirty and had writing and marks inside. I needed the book and could not send it back because my class started. I could have save money and brought a used book but I thought I was getting a new book. Very disappointed.
3,Marketing book,"The book was received in great condition. There was no CD in it as I expected, but the overall purchase was very pleasant. Thank you."
2,Not For sale in North America,"I purchased this book under the impression that it was the 8th ed, which is was. However, it is the International Edition that is not even available for sale in North America (it even says it on the back cover). So, buyer beware it is not the same book as the regular 8th Edition!"
3,"Marketing, 8th edition","There was some black tape on the cover, but besides that the book was in good condition."
4,Beautiful pictures and music,"At first I had difficulty playing some of the songs but once I got the hang of it I couldn't stop for me it was like watching the movie or listening to the soundtrack and it was alot of fun to learn to play the songs that capture the love of millions!I would reccommend this book to more advanced pianists, if you are a biginner try the easy piano vocal selections. But I promise you won't be disappointed."
2,Also disappointed,"After great anticipation, this song book arrived today. What a disappointment! I should have considered more the other ""disappointed"" review that pointed out the monotonous one note thumping in the left hand in almost every song. I will only buy ""piano solo"" sheet music in the future. It seems those are the only arrangements that have any meat to them. Anybody know how to get your own arrangement(s) published?"
2,Disappointing,"I suppose I am an intermediate pianist--about grade four --or five if I want to work a bit. I enjoy music which is a little challenging. I found this book disappointing because too many of the selections have only a monotonous thumping in the bass clef-only four or five notes for an entire song! My husband, in fact, suggested that I stop hitting the same key before it got hopelessly out of tune! I lack improvisation skills, so I find too much of the music boring and also frustrating---not a good combination!"
4,I Love it!,"I'm a big Phantom fan and haven't been as committed as I should have with my piano playing before I bought the book. Afterward, I have improved my sight reading and have bought other books to challenge myself. I have found that if I really want to learn a piece I will rise to the occassion even if the music is slightly more difficult than what I am accustomed to. I truly recommend this book to anyone!!"
4,Glad,"This was a good purchase, and has is fun to sing and play (the Piano) selections from this book."
2,good look but bad quality,"This VOIP phone has a really good look, is easy to install, but the quality is not the best. It's not possible to walk around in the apartment while calling someone, since sound quality decreases too much after walking away a few meters from the basis-station."
5,Revisit these American classics for the first time,"If you're like me, you basically know these stories from the many retellings of them in various media, but never actually got around to reading the originals written by Washington Irving. I finally did, and found it well worth doing. Irving is a fine writer, and puts in many details that make these stories much more vivid than in any other version I've heard and bring them to life. They also give fascinating glimpses into early American life, as when Rip Van Winkle declares his allegiance to King George and is nearly strung up by an angry mob. There is a reason these stories have become iconic, and that is because the originals drew these characters and their tales so brilliantly, much more so than any of the second-hand (and usually second-rate) versions."
5,BRILLIANT!,from the british MC comes this brilliant album! ... raw stuff with great flow in lyrics... he's in fact the best artist of britain!
5,Great pet watering system,"I use these water bottle kits for my birds and little Maltese dogs. The water stays clean, it's easy to find replacement bottles - just buy another drink in a glass bottle - juice, tea, etc., wash the bottle and you have it! No waiting for a shipment to arrive or running from store to store looking for the exact bottle you need. When you refill the bottle, use room temperature water, fill to the top, place the stopper in, put your finger over the tip, closing the water flow out of the tube, turn the bottle upside down, allow the bubbles to rise to the top (actually the bottom of the bottle), place the tube into the holder on the cage, and place the spring around the bottle. There should be very little to no dripping. This is the very best water bottle system I've found!"
4,"A Very Advanced Version of the Original, But NOT a Clone","Dreamlights is such a magical parade, probably because of the nostalgia from the original, and that nostalgia is very much presented in the music. However, if you are expecting the same musical lineup you are going to be let down. There is a lot of stuff from the original mixed in there but most of it is completely new. It's still really great to listen to and you really feel like you are there because they include all of the dialog from the parade on the track. A word of warning though, this is a JAPANESE CD, which means that there are several parts of dialog that are completely in Japanese. That doesn't hurt it though because it's still a great listen!"
2,Review of 28 inch High Sierra drop-bottom duffel,"I loved the space & pockets of this duffel. However, there was a major problem. The first time I used the duffel was on a flight cross country and the zipper around the drop bottom split open. Luckily the two buckles held my clothes in, although they did get dirty. I ended up using packing tape to hold it together. The duffel was strong & light - so a new zipper design is definitely needed."
2,Child finds this toy boring,"Toy boring to children. Much of the toy that appears as if it should move doesn't, i.e. white gate. Baby can't get animals out of the barn once they're in. Frustrating! Fish can't swim pond to pond if bar is swung too far to either side. Doesn't stay balanced well when playing with either side. Strange toy that just ends up on its side in the corner of the room, alone. Skip this toy."
3,I would have given it more but it wasn't in english,what are they saying I just couldn't understand. Were they trying to be funny. What kind of language is that. They should try to accomidate us people that don't speak spanish.
