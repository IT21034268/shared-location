1,sorry I bought this,"I never even got the thing put together. It had a ton of parts and all of them poor quality. I guess I didn't realize that the tent had a cloth bottom either so that even if I did get it together, the box would have to be slid inside (which probably wouldn't have been an easy task) instead on placing it over the box. Just not a good design."
1,0 stars,"Not worth the money at all.This product will only have you frustrated in about two seconds into assembly - The direction are very poor. The quality is very poor. The construction is very poor, and doesn't allow for easy access to the controls in the back of the machine. It's also too small for cats to do their business. It also broke within the first day."
3,Should Have bought the Tent,"My biggest complaint about this item is that the entire unit is encased in this Kabana. This causes 2 obstacles for me...1. if the power goes out, you have to unzip almost the entire thing to reach the power button and 2. when the machine runs, the life portion does not extend fully, cause the ends ""catch"" on the open flaps of the Kabana. I'd have been happier with a Littermaid Tent instead. Lastly, I think that this is quite expensive for some plastic tubing and a nylon bag with a zipper."
5,an insightful read,This book is very well written and explains the concepts of fatemi architecture very well. It is also notable that J saifuddin has done in depth research of other fatemi masjids and he does a good comparison of this masjid with other masjids giving us a full idea of what fatemi architecture is really about. Readers will be impressed by the in depth analysis of every aspect of the masjid and I would reccomend it to all from professionals and experts in the field all the way to those who who just want an interesting and useful read.
2,"Whatever you do, do not read this book","As some people have mentioned, this book is impossible to read. The derivations are unclear, the content lacks motivation, and the dull writing style makes the book a real chore to read. Do yourself a favor and read a different book on waves. Try Waves by Frank S. Crawford."
2,Vibrations and Waves for Non-physics majors.,"Pros: Good subject matter (very interesting), Pace of material is slow at first and builds at a good rate.Cons: Needs worked problems, lacks in-depth derivation, low readability, some sections of certain chapters lack all substance entirely.If you have a good teacher, this book is helpful...if not, sorry, you won't get much."
4,Fine writing on all genres of music,"A collection of great (and maybe not so great) essays on all genres of music, from a day in the life of Puff Daddy to Roseanne Cash remembering the songs her father sang her, to Lester Bangs' criticism, to a superb analysis of Ry Cooder's personality and music. I liked all the pieces, especially the quietly admiring piece on Cooder, the thorough look at the wild life and music of Nigerian musician Fela, and an erudite explanation of the musical legacy of gospel singer Dorothy Love Coates. It's interesting that the pieces that interested me the most were about musicians I knew the least; the best writing made me want to hear their music and appreciate it as much as these writers did. That really does make for the best of music writing."
5,Wonderful view from the outside looking in,"Disregard the one-star review. It is rare to find a book on Mormonism written by an outsider to Mormonism who treats it with such care, openness, and fairness. Davies's deep theological and anthropological knowledge are brought to bear on Mormon theology in ways that will give Mormons a greater appreciation for their beliefs and non-Mormons a greater understanding of Mormonism. Davies carefully and honestly engages with Mormon thought in a non-polemical way. His outsider's perspective should provoke reflection and new insights for life-long Mormons. It should also help non-Mormons understand the appeal and structure of the Mormon worldview. Some of the same points are made in Davies's newer book, ""Joseph Smith, Jesus, and Satanic Opposition."" These are both excellent books, I strongly recommend them."
4,Who needs Polybius or Livy?,"For anyone who has tried to trudge through Livy's account of the Hannibalian War, Goldsworthy's (AG's) book is extremely helpful.The ancient historians can be borderline-reliable. AG mentions frequently that timelines or characters are convoluted. He acts as a moderator between the ancient accounts, and giving his own best guess of events. This book is quite readable to amateur Greco-Roman historians like me, and the fact that much is lost from that period gives the whole subject a whiff of mystery.The first chapter on warfare and politics (they are, of course, mutually inclusive) in the ancient world is valuable. Most striking is the tediousness of preparing for battle: you'll never see this in ""Gladiator"" or ""Troy"". These are people and times so profoundly different than ours.So, if you're in between books about the Greatest Generation, try reading about the generation that lived through Trebia, Trasimene, and Cannae, and Zama."
3,"Tedious at times, but interesting none-the-less","This book should be titled the Rise of Rome. Goldsworthy spends much more time detailing and analyzing the factors that led to Rome's rise in power during the decades in which it was at war with Carthage. The final fall of Carthage is portrayed as having more do to with Rome's collective psyche and ambitions than with events happening in Carthage. All-in-all an interesting read (though at times repetitive and therefore tedious) of ancient history. However, I didn't get as much insight into the Fall of Carthage as I had hoped."
3,"Fabulous 3rd-Year Theme, plus","When LOST IN SPACE was revamped in its 3rd year in a genuine attempt to recapture the quality of the 1st (an effort that simply didn't go far enough) one of the highlights was a new theme song. Unlike the quirky paranoia of the original, the new tune musically evoked a sense of ADVENTURE and excitement. This is the song that was SO good, it got remade (in hi-tech style) for the feature film's end-credits. The remainder of this CD is okay, but I suspect there must be more and better scores unissued from the series awaiting further installments like this one."
4,Better than a tarp.,"I use this for my 2008 Suzuki SV650. The large fits very well, especially when the bike is up on stands."
4,Can't beat it for the price,"Looking at the cover, it seems durable and looks like it will last a long time. I am pleased with the purchase."
5,nice cover for the price,"used it outside on full dress venture, kept bike clean and dry, now use it in the garage for dust. nice all around cover, will sun fade, like all the lower end ones, but still good value."
3,Does the job,"It sure is a bike cover. A little awkward fitting it around a windshield, despite specifically being sold for bikes with them."
3,did not fit,Did not fit my honda vfr800 with luggage. Returned and ordering a larger cover. The material was more thin than the one I owned previously--it fit my suzuki sv650 + luggage.
1,not big enough to cover the entire bike,"not big enough to cover my bike, it,s said it was a large howevere it did not cover my road king, even with the rear luggage rack off"
5,Very Happy!!!,"For 36 bucks you can't go wrong, I ordered the xxl for my 2005 harley sportster 1200custom with saddle bags and windshield and there is more than enough room. Very good quality for the price,I can't say how it will hold up in severe weather right now,its spring time in my area,but as far as rain not a drop has leaked through. The elastic bottom is strong and it has two hooks on each side that you can clasp together under the bike for extra protection against the wind. The vinyl seems thick,there are thicker covers out there but like i said for 36 bucks you'll be happy with this product."
5,Nothing beats Nelson-Riggs quality motorcycle covers,You get what you pay for. I shopped around before buying this cover. No one seems to be able to match its quality. Covers.Reasonably priced. Keeps your bike clean in between rides with an attractive cover from Nelson-Riggs
1,"""No hassle"" warranty is a hassle...Cover fades fast.","Nelson-Rigg calls this an all-season cover, however it has completely faded after two months. When I called them to get a replacement thanks to their two year ""No Hassle"" guarantee, boy did I get hassled! They said that although it had UV protection, the sun will fade it. My question, ""Why do they even bother mentioning UV protection if it is going to fade after a couple of months. When I asked for a replacement, they refused and said the warranty only covers loose stitching. BUYER BEWARE. Be prepared for a hassle if you need to exchange the cover..."
4,Good cover,"This is a really good cover...I just should have ordered one that was a size bigger, I have a VTX 1800, it's 9ft llong and with a fairing and hard bags this cover just didn't quite make it..."
4,"Nice Cover, but not water proof","This cover is called an ""All Season"" cover. But when it rains my bike still gets a little wet. Overall it still works pretty well."
2,Don't be fooled,It's much smaller than what they say and very cheaply made.I wouldn't buy here again save your money buy better.
4,"Lightweight, durable and nice fasteners","A little more lightweight than I would have liked, but it seems pretty durable. I hook and strap fastening system is a nice touch and I like that it straps in two places, the front wheel and mid-bike. Well done."
2,..,It repels the weather great but it tears and the heat resistant part melted in spots on my muffeler. Still usable but disappointing looking
3,Fits but does not keep bike dry,"The cover fits perfectly, but the bike is all wet when I uncover it in the morning. My old cover did a better job of keeping it dry."
2,Not as advertised,"When I took the cover out of the box/bag, I thought ""Wow this is a pretty nice looking cover. Double layered, has grommets for tying off, and it fit the bike nicely. How fortunate that I got it on the bike before it started to rain. It stopped raining and I wanted to do some work on the bike. Low and behold IT AIN'T WATER PROOF! Not at all pleased at that. Back to the tarp....."
2,Not as great as I thought,"I previously had the Nelson-Rigg and it was a lot better quality. Perhaps it was the Falcon an not the deluxe. In any case, this seemed like cheap plastic to me and the fit was a bit tight.I had purchased the XL for a Boulevard C50 with windshield (the smaller one) and saddlebags and it was a really tight fit.I returned it (thanks Amazon) and purchased the Falcon 2000 in the XXL. Hopefully that works better."
4,good for the money,"although i havent had it long enough to judge it holding up to u.v. wear..fit for my full dress 1100 gk is perfect..built in ties are well placed..i will get another when needed..at the price i'm hoping for 2 seasons,or a yr plus couple months....thanks...so far amazon...approx 30 purchases,and no complaints"
3,tight fit,Buy bigger than you think. I have a 800cc with windshield and bags and the X Large doesn't fit. Be nice if they posted a size chart. Box was kind of trashed in shipping so I'm stuck with it.
2,Cheap,"After reading the reviews I thought this would be a decent cover, unfortunately I was wrong. The cover is very light and cheap feeling I left it on my bike for 3 days and it did rain lightly one of the days and some water did get in, but it is just a ""water resistant"" cover so I cant complain. I will still use this cover as an emergency type thing and keep it in my saddle bag."
4,2 years and still going strong.,"2 years later, it's still holding up just fine. The last cover I purchased from Cycle Gear (for twice the price), only lasted a year and a half before the fabric began disintegrating."
4,Finally.......,"a band was able to make me rest my Nekromantix- and Reverend Horton Heat-CDs! Dead Kings, kind of a psychobilly allstars (members of Nekromantix, Mad Sin, Batmobile among others) band, has really hit the spot as far as I'm concerned. This contains a fine mixture of psychobilly, punk and heavy metal...a bit like Bad Religion playing psychobilly. I've had this CD for months now, and tracks like ""Dead Kings Ball"", ""The Other Side"" and ""White Trash on the Sniff"" stills seems fresh. And furthermore...unlike a lot of psychobillybands, these guys seem to have taken a political stand lyric-wise."
2,"Good potential, but too oily.","I read the reviews complaining about how oily or greasy these leashes were, but decided the reviews must be nit picking in consideration of the other positive comments. Big Mistake! The leather is just too impregnated with oil. If you squeeze the leash it oozes oil on the surface. Wiping with solvents does no good. The only way to get rid of the excess oil would be to run the leash through a pair of rollers spaced about 1/16 inch apart to literally squeeze it out. I don't recommend this leash unless you aren't bothered by a little oil getting on your hands and everything else it touches."
1,WTF?,"$888.00 for a useless out of print warhammer fantasy box set? Its not even considered collectible as everything inside it is low quality except for the rulebook itself which you can get on ebay for 5 dollars. BUYER BEWARE, this is a rip off."
2,Not that rugged,"Mine stayed intact for about one year. It seems to be advertised as a flash drive that can take a beating, but I don't know how helpful the rubber casing is. It creates more opportunity for bending between the USB connector (the tip that you stick into the USB port) and the rest of the internal components since there is no rigid body. This means that even without abusing it, the metal connections between the connector and where memory is stored become weaker and weaker. My connector broke off entirely yesterday. Maybe the rubber would make it sturdier if it was formed over an actual rigid case. I did give it 2 stars because I used it for a year without too many problems."
4,Not as good as expected,The flash drive works well and is easy to partition into secure and nonsecure drives. You have ready access to both partitions once entering your password. Don't bother attaching the lanyard because it will easily tear the molded rubber jacket of the flash drive. There is no structural case at all.
5,Mr. Motown,"This series of CD's (which so far only consists of 6) are some of the greatest CD's ever made. You get the genuine track with lead vocals removed. NOT A CHEAP IMITATION KARAOKE CD. Most songs have the background singers intact. The exception is ""Baby Love"" by The Supremes. While it is great to have a true instrumental version of this timeless classic, it would also be nice to hear Mary and Flo singing loud and proud on the track that has the lead vocal removed. I really hope they re-release a version like this. But still, these CD's are worth every penny! If you buy it, you SO will NOT be disappointed!"
3,"Suspenseful, tackles grief and regret","My older children, ages 6 and 4 (at the time of this review), hung on my every word when I read this book to them. Both my son and daughter found the story funny and morbidly fascinating. My four year old daughter liked hearing about all the pets the characters had and empathised with Verity when her kitty died. My son longed to hear chapter after chapter, taking in the difficulty Verity's family has accepting her mother's death and how Verity deals with the loss of her very old cat. He also appreciated the minor plotlines of a bullying classmate who taunts Verity with threats to unleash a pet constricter snake on her. Both kids were grossed out by the cat's 'worrisome smell' but never scared by the way death was presented in this book. Thanks to this book, I believe they were made to feel comfortable enough to approach a parent with their concerns about death or having fibbed. However, due to the special subject matter this isn't a book we read over and over."
4,keyboard,I am very satisfied with the product I ordered. The keyboard fits my hand span comfortably and I am very pleased with the overall concept.The service was quick and arrived in good condition.Thank you for offering quality products at affordable prices.
1,I wil never buy an apple again...,"I bought a G5 in July and 2 weeks after that, the computer broke up. The CD unit didn't work anymore. It was my first and last apple. When I was deciding to buy an apple, I thought it was the best choice because it was an excelent brand with great products and quality. But it wasn't. When I start checking up on the net for support, I found a lot of opinions of people that had the same problem as me. It seems like something pretty normal to happen. So if you decide to buy one of this computer, just be shure it has its warranty..."
2,Misleading,"The review for this product was misleading. Although a used book, the description said ""like new"" with ""minor wear"" but when I received it, sections of the book were all marked up in difficult to erase dark pencil. I wasted an hour of my time trying to erase all of the markings so I could take the test myself. STILL can see which answers were circled.Very Disappointing."
4,BOAT STEREO,"Great small stereo. The speakers that came with it were not as good on base as I had hoped so I upgraded with ""Dual DMS652 6 1/2"" 2-Way, Poly, Marinized, 175 W"" ($47.18). The quality of the sound is very good and I am quite satisfied."
4,cheap works,"as stated - cheap, simple, waterproof, sound quality good. just don't complain about sound quality compared to high end speakers like jl if you are not spending that amount of cash."
5,Have listened to this for 25 years!!!! Cassette was stolen,"As the other reviews stated, this is truly one of the great surf sounds. But you can get the movie on video: Toes on the Nose in Laguna Beach carries it in stock. My husband and I made this our standard sound when we drove up the coast 25 1/2 years ago"
4,Soundtrack of the 70's surfer,"Many of the tracks from this film soundtrack have become classics. Instrumentals such as ""Pipeline Sequence"", ""Brad and David's Theme"", and ""Lopez"" truly defined the ""70's surf"" music. In a genre spilling over with the frantic stylings of the early 1960's (and again in this decade), Honk's gentle-yet-intense trademark really took listeners into the barrel. Vocal tracks like ""Don't Let Your Goodbye Stand"" were not reminding anyone of Brian Wilson. The ""Pipeline Sequence"" still rests in the Pantheon of surf music, as this soundtrack (despite its occasional dips into country twang) has outdistanced even the immortal FSS films that it was created to back up."
4,This is a classic! Soundtrack from Endless Summer Movie,"The Pipeline Sequence is a must. In addition to being the soundtrack for Endless Summer (dream surfing saga), it was also the theme song for the Olympics."
3,Good but you'll love this one,"Honk is a fairly good album and would certainly appeal to those with inclinations towards the surf sounds/vibes from the early 70s. I won't add anymore to what has been said already but I will say if you like this sort of stuff, genre, vibe etc you MUST check out the Morning Of The Earth soundtrack - an Australian surf movie from the early 70s. It is the essential album (and if you can get the video even better - a FANTASTIC movie with incredible tubular footage and psychedelic camera work) combining a love of surfing, hippy sentiments, mind expansion and feelings of freedom. It literally chnaged my life causing me to hit the road up the east Australian coast. Enough said - Honk is good but nice and tame, this is beautiful..."
1,8 Months to Deliver!!,"I love the music, it's Da Kind Bra!But this is the worst transaction with Amazon by far. I ordered this on Nov 8, 2008 and it just arrived Jun 16, 2009. EIGHT freaking months!! WTF!!!!"
1,Never recieved order from Supermart,"The Original Soundtrack From Five Summer StoriesI really, really wanted this soundtrack. I found a seller on Amazon,(Supermart) placed the order, paid the price asked by seller, watched the expected delivery date come, and go... never received the product, never heard a word from the seller. Very, very disappointed. Amazon has informed me that my purchase price will be refunded. I placed this order a month ago."
4,A true 1970's surfing anthem,"This soundtrack helped bring the ""Five Summer Stories"" films into surf-flick immortality. The famous ""Pipeline Sequence"" truly defines the feeling of being in the barrel, feeling the power. ""Don't let Your Goodbye Stand"" and ""Brad & David's Theme"" are classic examples of the 70's mellow tolerance. While some of the grassier tracks on this album are better skipped, they are small in comparison to the utter ecstasy brought from this album."
5,Great flashbacks,"A favorite album from my college days, great tunes and great memories. Happy to have the CD to add to my digital collection."
3,Played Arcadia High School In 1971,"When Honk was starting out they had played one Saturday evening at Arcadia High School, CA in the boys gym. After their gig, I bought the album just so I'd have it for a summer vacation beach house in Newport Beach. Must have played pipeline a hundred times that summer week."
5,"Finally, a comprehensive guide with georgeous photos!","This book is so well organized and the information provided for each of the featured tomatoes is impressive. Really liked how each tomato has a full page color photograh of it with its foliage, and how some maters are sliced in half to show the inside characteristics. The only thing that could be better is to have a sequel book with another 100 different varieties."
5,book lover,I love the (2) books on Heirloom Tomatoes; the quality was great. I learned more about them then I ever thought possible. I sent a book to my son in IN who is really the gardener. He too thought the book was awesome and has found that he would like to grow some tomatoes he saw in the book.I will shop AMAZON for all my book needs!
1,PLEASE retire this worn out and horrid book,"This book is a disgrace and is so OLD and OUTDATED it should be retired with a little dignity and class. Everyone should return it for a refund and not be ripped off. SO SAD....even sports figures know when it's time to hang up the jersey.:( Poor Dr. Carolyn Male just needs to stop living in the past. Even when this poor, tired book first appeared it's pictures were so horrid and did not represent our Tomato Industry very well. PLEASE Doctor...take it off of the market. Have a little bit of pride PLEASE!! I recommend books by Gary Isben and other reputable growers."
2,Could get as much info from seed catalogs,"The info in this book could be gotten out of seed catalogs and even some seed catalogs give more info than you get in this book. There is not much info about each tomato. The 2 page spread consists of 1/2 page of info about the tomato in large print and the second page is a huge picture. There is no info about the history of the heirloom tomato. Also, 100 Heirloom tomatores does not scratch the surface of types you will find in the market. I am returning this book."
3,Good,"I got this camera on sale so especially for the price I paid I feel like it's a great little camera. The picture quality is generally good, and it has quite a few features and it's user-friendly in every way. The only thing that it has done to bother me is get a little fuzzy on long-distance shots when you're using the zoom (w/o the zoom they're clear and close up zoom shots are very clear). But a higher speed film (at least 400) seems to minimize that problem. I am looking for a new camera b/c I want a more powerful zoom, but I will continue using this one as well, especially outdoors, for the panoramic mode."
4,"My new camera, Advantix",I like the camera but have not used it except two pictures. I need to get used to the camera but think it will work out fine.I would recommend it to a friend.
5,I love it,"A very good camera. Easy to operate. I do not use it as much now though, opting for disposable cameras, because the film for this camera is difficult to obtain unless I order it from Amazon (smile). Even so, I still will use this camera when film for it becomes available again, in the local stores, because it is so easy to use."
5,I have discover the classics!,"I wanted some office background music to drowned out all of the distracting noises around me. What has happen instead is that I have become the office disc jockey. Requests come to me over the intercom all day long asking to hear one of the many selections available on the Discover The Classics 3 disc set. I'm glad cd's were invented, otherwise I would have worn the groove off this vinyl LP months ago. Got to go, just received another request for ""Moonlight Sonata."""
5,auditor,"I have used this scanner for over a year at work and had no problems. It allows to scan page by page anything up to 8.5"" wide. It also allows to add comments to both text and pictures. Cut/copy and paste function allows to reproduce portions of the document, including both comments and the scanned 'picture'. And not only in the document itself. You can paste into Word, Excel or PaintBrush, if you wish, as a picture (it comes out big, but can be easily resized).The text recognition feature that comes with the software allows to convert the document into either Word or Excel, if you had a table, for example.You can also use the software to fill in blanks in a form, just drag your document into the 'typewriter' (or 'ABC') icon on the bottom of the screen.Very compact, about 10""x3""x4"", it's an excellent tool if you travel with equipment. The ""lid"" has 2 positions, allowing for the sheet to either go towards the user (feeder side) or slide out of the back of the devise."
1,Product stopped working after 5 months,This product just stopped working after 5 months. I would not recommend buying this product. It wasnt cheap and I expected it to last longer than 5 months
5,For Any Educator,This book is the real deal. It is informative and gets to the point fast. Definetly worth buying!!!!
4,:),"This is a great, current book that provides a well-rounded amount of information about Autism in the schools."
4,"Good, but short","Stoney LaRue is one of my favorites and doesn't disappoint in terms of quality on this album. This album is disappointing in terms of length, though. When the CD stopped at 41 minutes, I thought it was defective. Turns out that's all you get on this one. Great music though for 41 minutes."
2,left me cold,People who endured bad childhoods tend to either make the mistake of thinking that NOBODY in the world had it as bad as they did or they make the mistake of thinking that EVERYBODY is just as messed up as they are. Ms. Darbo takes the second road and it got really very tiresome. I've given this book away twice and got it back both times.
2,Get Real Patrika,"Patrika could have penned a really great book, but instead she seemed to think she is all that and a much bigger celebrity than she really is. Had she just written a book with insights into what it's like to be a plus size actress without all the tons of personal who cares biographical crap and armchair psychology I really don't think she's appropriate to spew it really might have been fab. Instead it's a like a fat girl cheer but not from a real live like you and me fat girl, it's from a fat girl on her own pedestal (but who wear Cherokee?!) Read Camryn Manheim's memoir instead, it's MUCH better and she's much more true to life even though she is rightfully a much bigger deal than Patrika! Trust me, I've read all the fat girl memoirs!"
4,kiddo keeps scarfing it,"I read this book because I a long time viewer of Days of our Lives, but haven't had the time to watch recently. Any large woman who gets popular is somebody I want to read about. After reading the trial of a woman who is large, but paid her dues I felt refreshed. This book is funny, with advice. It may not be advice you could use, but its there, with the message of ""large woman like sex too.""Then when I tiredly decided to have a yard sale to get rid of my stuff, this book was on the ""go"" stack. Until that is my 17 year old saw it, grabbed it and hid it in her room."
3,"Great Series, Blurry Blu-Ray","I recently purchased this set because of a good overall star rating and didn't read all of the reviews... shame on me. Please make sure that the reviewers actually purchased the product (like myself) and don't get suckered into 5 star 'hype' non-reviews.This is a great series and a good English dub, but I agree with the other user's review that the Blu-Rays are blurry and that the DVD version looks better. I have checked both versions (Blu-Ray and DVD) in PowerDVD and the other user is right: the Blu-Ray version is such a bad standard definition up-convert (blurry, soft, bright) that the DVDs look a lot better.I wouldn't mind buying this series on DVD if it were only released on DVD, but I feel like I've been cheated on the Blu-Rays. If you're still interested in checking out this series, it's definitely worthwhile, but beware of the poor Blu-Ray quality."
4,"A good social subject,","The movie has a good social subject and is about caste ism and monopoly in villages of India. The hero takes up the fight for the commoners and ultimately executes the tyrants. Rajesh Khanna the Super Star is the hero of the movie and is supported well by Sridevi, Jaya Prada and Padmini Kolhapore. Kader Khan plays the tyrant supported by Ranjeet. The movie is mounted well, good sets, good editing, good direction. The movie had above average music by Bappi Lahiri. This hit is a must see for Rajesh Khanna fans as he plays the role of the protagonist to perfection and puts up great performance. He is good in dance and action scenes also in the movie. Him dancing with young Sridevi is a treat to watch."
2,More fair to poor writing,"The first story is fair; they slide progressivly towards poor and hateful sickness. This is, once again, a collection of writing from an author who seems devout in her desire to prodice poor work and then dare anyone to criticize it, by setting herself up as a martyr.There are many varied and brilliant feminist and/or women writers, who take the time to study writing, character analysis, style, form, etc... Such must have all bought into the ""oppressors"" dictum of ""male"" writing, if one were to believe this ""liberated"" author.I somewhat enjoyed ""The Female Man"", but that was back in the days when I was more radically femenist myself, in college. If the book can't hold interest past the college age, it is not very much worth the writing, or the reading. In any case, take a look at The Femal Man, and you will get the gist of this author, allowing you to skip the rest."
1,Classic Bait and Switch,I ordered the this item and what I received was a different cheaper model. I will never order from Fog Dog again and am considering the same for AMAZON. I contacted FOG Dog and have returned the scanner. I was told I would recieive a full purchase refund plus the cost of the retunn shipping. Within an hour I received an email indicating there would be no refund for the return shipping cost. I am still wainting for the refund for the purchase price of the SC230 scanner I ordered but was not delivered. BEWARE!!Uniden SC230 Scanner featuring Pre-Programmed NASCAR / Busch Frequencies
3,not loud enough,My scanner did not produce enough volume to hear above the race engines even with my headset. My old radio shack scanner is much louder.But my buddy bought the same scanner and he says that his is plenty loud.
3,Hard to program and figure out!,GREAT FOR NASCAR!!! BUY IT IF YOU GO TO THE RACES!!Hard to program and figure out for anything else! Very time consuming to program anything but nascar. Also too easy to mess up the nascar preprogrammed frequencies if you don't know what you are doing! Very complicated manual. Not real straight forward!
1,Programing out of date,"Just bought this scanner paid $174.00 for it because it was ""pre-programed"" thinking it would be race ready, over the refurbished unit of $129.00 which clearly advises it is not ""pre-programed"". The programing in this item is OUT OF DATE it still has Dale Jarret racing in the #88 car and he has been retired at least two years. So I paid $45.00 more for this item and if I can't figure out how to program it myself I will have to spend at least $25.00 to have it programed. SO as I see it I spent $45 to $70 dollars more than if I bought the REFURBISHED unit as I have to program my ""pre-programed"" anyway. I should have just bit the bullet and bought it at the track as it would have been ""race-ready"". It is a great unit sharp looking appears to be well built. I give rave reviews for this scanner but SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY THE REFURBISHED MODEL."
3,Nice... but...,"The keyboard is good looking, and keys are easy to depress, perhaps too easy. I use this with my Mac, which has a keyboard preferences panel. I'm sure that Windows OS has a similar control. I am able to determine with that panel both the time I want to hold down a key, and then the rate at which the held letter will repeaat.No matter how I set that panel, I still get double letters (like ""howwdy"") with even a quick depression of the key.There seems to be no rhyme or reason to the repeat, but it is a pain! If this were corrected, I'd add a star."
5,A Refreshing Jazz Take on Mostly Familiar Traditional Christmas Favorites,"This album is a nice mix of slower swing arrangements and more upbeat treatments. There's lots of genuine improvisation. I am no jazz expert, but this recording feels like the real thing."
5,A Cool Jazz Christmas,"This is the best! Family members who have collected albums of the jazz greats said ""this made my Christmas!"" If you love good jazz, you'll love this one."
5,The Absolute Best!,"Without a doubt the most complete training program I have ever had my hands on! The text, endless pictures, and great video clips shows any dog trainer how it is suppose to be done. This book on CD-ROM is sure to change the industry! It is a must have for new trainers and evened seasoned trainers will learn a few tricks or two to get the most out of your training! I have a ten month old chessie pup that I have been training using Butch's system and she is leaps and bounds ahead of any pup I have ever trained. Great job Butch!"
2,The Jerry Lewis Show Collection,"First Off I could not wait to see this set,the show which aired from 1967-68 has never been syndicated.Now for the bad news!,Infinity has butchered them! first they have replaced the original shows opening with thier own,next they have cut out all the musical acts(probably because they did not want to pay for the rights)so basically all your getting are the shows skits which average 23 minutes and even those are EDITED!.It's good to see them but don't expect anywhere near close to what they originally looked like on air in 1967-68.Thumbs down to Infinity!"
1,waste of money!!!!!!! unless your a fan.,"I agree with other bad reviews of this set. I had hopes of seeing complete sketches in a collection similar to the Dean Martin Show dvd series, but this?!?! The sketches are chopped up, shortened, and the original intros are remade with some 1980's syndication style electronic music and graphics. Each show is about 23 mins. or just 2 sketches. Worst off, they include a photo gallery of images from the series that gives you a clue as to how fun this show actually was...before this dvd company got a hold of them. I'll take the old scratchy kinescopes floating around on youtube rather than this set. I love Jerry's comedy, but let's have complete shows."
5,Fun in a box,"This was a christmas gift and arrived in plenty of time. If you are a jerry Lewis fan, this is a must to add to your collection."
5,Junko Yagami has great recommendations,"The sub-title for this CD album, ""Pop Hits"", is ""My Recommendations"". There are 18 of these recommendations. They are all at least excellent (A); some are outstanding (A+). Yagami Junko San can really sing well. It is obvious that she has had voice training, which has made her impact even greater to the listener. I am so glad that I was given the opportunity to hear her sing.-- Roger E. Doss"
2,"the same as vice city, but not as fun","GTA:Vice City is great, but Vice City stories is nothing compared to the others. In this game you play as a radom black military guy, and isn't talked about in vice city. Overall this is a bummer, and i love the regular vice city."
2,Poorly made GTA,"The product in question, G.T.A. Vice City Stories, is very poorly done. I didn't like the story at all, and the graphics are very badly done."
2,Sucked,This game worked like it was new but the game is horrible in story do not buy if your a fan of Vice City
4,An improvement over Liberty City Stories,"I am just starting this game and already I love it. The sound track if nothing else does it for me. Other improvements include swimming and flying, which were missing in LCS. This is a $20 game and was meant for the psp so keep that in mind. The graphics are not great but the classic game play more than makes up for it. All the LCS naysayers may not be that impressed but it's only meant to be an added installment to Vice City not an improvement over the other titles. Again, the soundtrack is what sets it apart from LCS. Classic eighties tunes and hillarious commercials. For $20 a steal and a good tide-over 'til GTA4 for ps3."
5,I had no idea this edition existed,"I was looking for Grand Theft Auto 3 on Amazon to complete my collection and I ran into Vice City Stories and Liberty City Stories. Of course, I had to order all three. I played Vice City Stories and it was awesome. Not better than the original Vice City though. And I left Liberty City Stories in the packaging to save just for the collection."
3,Pretty Fun,"This game is fun, but not as fun as the original. There are some neat additions though, like when you suffer a concussion from being too close to an explosion the controls and the screen move all around and prevent you from driving easily. I enjoyed this game for a couple of days before I went back to Final Fantasy XI. I plan to play more on a rainy day.Sincerely,Ira Carmel."
2,Worst Entry of GTA,"After playing through the trilogy of GTAs and Liberty City Stories, I would have to say this is the worst one of them all. The story was mature, but this game just took itself too seriously. Graphicswise, this game is showing its age, but comparatively, the originalGrand Theft Auto Vice City's graphics were better in my opinion. Gameplaywise, the game was absolutely horrible. The driving and targeting was horrendously loose. This game will satisfy your cravings for GTA until GTA IV. Until then, avoid this game if you possibly can and pick up the better game,Bully."
5,fun game kinda monotonous,"Rockstar phoned this one in. I liked the first GTA stories game, this one wasn't as great but still fun to play. I would recommend if you're a fan of the series."
1,an upgrade frome the first vicecity,"This game was the same like the first vicecity but you play as a black guy and it has a different story. GTA is really getting boaring it's just the same stuff, so this game was not good."
2,STICK WITH THE ORIGINAL VICE CITY,"I did not like this game at all.The only reason I gave it a 2,instead of a 1,is because it's based in Vice City.But I thought the storyline and the main character was lame.I would say pass this up,and stay with the original Vice City.It's alot better."
5,For both the player and the scholar,"Drum Gahu is another marvel produced by the leader of Ewe drumming in this country, David Locke. Locke systematicly takes the reader through the patterns, playing techniques, and descriptions of each instrument; the bell, the rattle, kagan, kidi, sogo, and the master drum. In addition, he provides the reader with execises for the playing of these instruments. The text is easy to read, but the musical notation is a bit small. I highly recommend buying the Drum Gahu tapes that are available. The tapes are of Locke performing most of the musical examples in the book. It also has an excerpt of Gahu being performed in Africa; the real thing! I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning about Ewe drumming, and to anyone interested in learning to play Gahu."
5,Great read!,"Don't know why I bypassed this series before. Once I start reading, I can't seem to put the graphic novel down, until the last page!"
3,Keeping up the pace,"This is a good continuation of the series. I don't want to get too much into it and reveal spoilers, but it was a filler issue in my opinion. I didn't think too much was going on in this volume, but nevertheless you need to get this. It introduces a new character to the comic. If you like the other books, don't stop now, it has just begun."
4,Needed more zombies and less soap opera,"""The Heart's Desire"" was my least favorite of the first four volumes, due primarily to its heavy focus on melodrama and petty in-fighting. Side note - I'm halfway through volume 5 as I write this review, and I'm happy to report things are back on track.Volume 4 introduces Michonne, the cloak-wearing, sword-bearing, zombie-escorting badass. I closely follow news regarding The Walking Dead television show, so I was well aware of Michonne's status as a fan favorite, and I'd been anticipating her appearance. To put it mildly, I don't love any of the female characters with their pettiness and whining, but I'm expecting Michonne to change that."
5,Great Series,"After watching season one of the AMC TV show, I started onto the graphic novels. Excellent storyline, fantastic graphics. Book arrived in timely fashion and was packaged well."
2,Skip the comic books &,"watch the TV version instead.So far, I don't care too much for the books of The Walking Dead, although, I absolutely love the TV version."
5,In Reference to early volumes,"I love this comic and the dead quadrilogy Night, Dawn, Day, Land. Specifically because in all these versions of the zombie mythos you do not have to be bitten to become a zombie all you have to do is die, getting bitten only speeds up your inevitable death. When I see in films that people only become zombies when bitten I get a bit ticked off, in Romero's verse (which I prefer) all that is required is death. Anyway other than his films these comics are my favorite zombie stories."
4,WALKING DEAD VOLUME 4,This was probably one of the best walking dead comics yet. It was amazingly intense. The only thing I didn't like was that there was a little to much talking. Highly recommended.
5,Great,Awesome once you pick it up you can't put it down a real page turner can't wait to get into the next volume
3,THE WORST SO FAR,"The Walking Dead has in many respects been the most rewarding zombie narrative to emerge in a couple of decades and, as such, the series as a whole easily deserves 5 stars. Then why just three for this book? Well, the Five Star Fan Boys below are cruising on sheer enthusiasm, offering up comic idolatry rather than employing their critical faculties responsibly. Book 4 - which does have some killer expansion of character - also loses some of the sharpness, some of the realism, and some of the tenacious sense of impending horror that marked the first three installments. It also shows the first time that Kirkman writes himself into a corner - ""You kill, you die"" - and then cheats his way out of the concluding actions. Either Kirkman made a tactical error in coosing the central theme or he lost his balls -- either way, this book is by far the weakest installment of the four Walking Dead collections."
4,The dead keep walking...,Even though this volume didnt have the same impact as the previous 3 volumes its still in keeping with the quality of the rest of the stories. Like the rest of the series I enjoyed this volume a lot. It certainly is better than a lot of the other material out there and Kirkman is great at telling these stories. The grey toned artwork is fabulous as always and the reader is left wanting more of the story. Great read!
3,amazon app is not good at all,"Ok the title might seem misleading.I bought this book on my ipod they say that i'm eligible to get one day shipping. One day shipping that would be cool. but if only they told whats the price. Jeez, I bought the book and its only nine buck but the shipping is like twenty dollars, not worth the one day shipping. I don't mind waiting to save an extra buck. I just wished that amazon could of gave me an option just like on the PC version to see the prices and choose an shipping option. It's annoying especially you thought you were going to save money and you would thought they would give you convenience because its on a app.my three starts goes to the book it would be 4 but the price for the shipping is stupidly highp.s. I live in Washington and just so guys know amazon is stationed here and they shipped it FROM Seattle. I mean COME ON 20 bucks for an hour drive from one location."
2,"This is okay, but very repetitive.","I'm not going to say much, just that his character, Charmer, as he's called in the books, never ever ever dies. He's always ready to fight a trainer. This is just a bit unrealistic, I think, and that some guy/girl, who was completely obsessed with Pokemon, specifically Charmander, went and tried to write a book. This book is only expensive because of info on the game, and quality of the paper that it's written on."
1,Don't waste the money.,"This book is just one guy, Jason R. Rich, who watched some other guy play the Pokemon Game Boy game and wrote down what happened. It is worth nil. If you want Pokemon stuff, buy the official players' guide. And by the way, it happened like this: Game Boy game, then the TV show, then the cards toys and comics."
4,IT WAS A GOOD BOOK,"When I first got this book I thought is was going to be very crummy, but when I started to read it I could not take my eyes off it. It was so different from the episodes on T.V. and I didn't know what was going to happen next to the young traveler, ASH."
3,Interesting idea,"Ultimately, a little flawed in places, but the driving idea behind it keeps it kicking. Perhaps with a little more attention to detail a higher mark would be a more realistic proposition. But...it's Pokemon, so how can you hate it?"
2,This book had a lot of errors,"I'm sorry to say but I have to rate this book with two ** because in the beging it said that Ashes rival picked squrtle and Ash himself picked Chamander and named it Charmer But when Ash beat the Elite four and fought his rival again it said he had a Charizard instead of the envolved for of squrtle, Blastoies. So I really hate to say it but I still give this book two **!!!!!!"
3,Not bad,"Its a GREAT book with an entire walkthrough. Except for 3 things : 1. How could Gary have a Charizard in the end if he started with a Squirtle? 2. Where did they put in Articuno or Zapdos? and 3. The review I read from an email said that the book had the complete walkthrough of the game in the book. How can it show how you beat the game? AND it didnt tell how Ash caught pokemon in the unknown dungeon. Not too bad , i give it 3 stars."
1,not too helpful but still helpful,It really byte i knew everything in it all i didn't know the evolution dates!
4,cool!!!,"The Pokeman book is a very good way to take the game step by step. It gives almost every single detail. It gives tips, hints, lists every Pokeman and thier stats,pictures,and where thier found, even the cute,cuddly,popular Pikachu! It is well worth the money. If you have the game it's a definite yes!"
5,A little too good........,"It is written perfectly. A most helpful guide. It is perfect for the game and out of the game. I really think you should buy it just to look at it is fun. Take it from me, IT IS A VERY HELPFUL BOOK!!"
3,A novelization of Pokemon,"Well, It's ok. It does follow the storyline of the game pretty closely, but gives no other info(items, individual pokemon info). That's how it got 3 stars. If you would like to read a pokemon story, this is it. If you want to beat the Gameboy Pokemon game, stick with a players guide."
1,Pokemon is unrealalistic!!,"HOw can the safe and ""correct"" way to catch Pokemons in the wild be through brutal blood thirsty battles where one forcefully trained pokemon attacks an innocent wild creature to make a slave out of it?? How come whenever they talk the only word they say is their own name, yet it means something different everytime, and those slave drivers can understand them everytime. What a joke!! (I wish there was a blank star option)"
2,Could have been better.,When i first got this book I thought it was going to be great I was wrong. They say the exact thing they do in the game boy game. But still it was ok a little because it was diffrent form the show. Plus i wish it had details.
4,2 flaws.Just 2.,"FLAW #1:No Articuno!I cannot belive that!!He didn't even make an appearance!Even if Ash HADN'T caught Articuno,I'd still give it 5 stars.But no Articuno at all?!?!Just CRAZY. FLAW#2:OK,this is pretty messed up,It's not an appearance flaw like ARTICUNO'S!!Gary chose Sqirtle in the beginning,so HOW THE HECK did he end up with Charizard at the end!?I've played the game,and beaten it,and your rival ALWAYS has the final form of his starting Pokemon as his last Pokemon,so Gary should have had Blastoise.Otherwise,Exeggutor-lent!Heh-heh.:OP P.S.:Pokemon Stadium is coming this fall!Be prepared!!"
3,it's ok,this book is baicly a walkthourght of the game whitout alot of spoilers.if you have beten the game and got all the one chance pokemon i don't sujuested you to bye it.
1,I could get a different book,It was boring cause it like the gameboy game. Ash doesn't start with pikachu like he did on the show. If it was all the episodes I would like it better
5,Great album,"This is the album that started it all. If you love absolutely beautiful guitar work, Revelation will be a religious experience. Prashant is a true craftsman, and this album is a work of art."
2,This is a poor copy,"I recieved this poster as a gift. The poster it is obviously a forged copy, maybe even pirated. I like the movie but poster quality is poor. The entire image is fuzzy. Standing a more than a few feet back the casual eye wouldn't notice, but anyone observing the poster for the detail can immediately tell it's a poor copy. Either someone took a picture of the poster and increased the dimensions or it was scanned with inferior technology.If you don't mind the imperfection then buy it. But if you appreciate quality pass it up."
5,Working fine and GENUINE Dell Battery for Inspiron 8600,"This is a GENUINE Dell Inspiron 8600 battery. It's just been over a month since I have been using the battery and the charge seems be to holding good. If you are looking to get a Genuine battery compared to cheaper china made generic OEM battery, this is the one. I paid about $48 for this battery which was closer to the cheaper china made ones. No regrets until now. My original battery which came with my laptop lasted almost 4 years without any issues. I am wishing for the same luck with this battery also. :)"
1,Look elsewhere,"As stated on the other review, power lines shut down the AM side of the radio rendering it useless. Today, barely two months after install, the radio receiver failed on me and I have an e-mail request in for tech support to advise me on what to do with it. This is the third Jensen stereo unit I've bought and have been sorry three times. My opinion is to look at other brands."
1,Terrible AM reception/interference,Pass anywhere an overhead power line and the radio screeches so badly you need to turn it off.When I asked Jensen's tech support for advice they just blew me off.
3,Not Bad.,"I like how it lights up blue to match the inside of my vehicle, and I like the aux feature. However, I don't like the fact that the volume on the tuner setting is not that loud. The volume only goes up to 40. Other than that, it's a good radio."
5,porter cable review,I got this for christmas and i love it. i've been able to put up base molding and chair railing. The gun has never misfired or jamed.
1,Porter Cable pancake compressor/brad nailer combo,"The compressor arrived with a pressure shut-off valve that did not work at all. Now I am faced with finding a Service Center to repair a brand new tool, one of the down sides of buying on line."
5,Perfect for my needs.,I purchased this kit because I had a ton of baseboard molding to replace. This included everything I needed in one convenient package and is perfectly sized for my needs. I have used it for molding installation and have purchased two additional nailers to use with the compressor: a framing nailer and flooring stapler. The compressor will cycle more often because of its small capacity but that is not a problem as long as you are near an electrical source. This is the perfect size for the home improvement enthusiast.
4,A happy owner!!,"I bought this kit because I wanted a larger compressor than I had, one with a tank, and a brad gun. I came upon this and bought it. The gun is great and never jams and is easily adjustable. The compressor works flawlessly. My only complaint (be it a minor one for me) is that the thing sounds like a jackhammer. It is LOUD!!! I mostly use it in my garage so I ended up puting it in a shed outside and running a hose into the garage. Now I barely hear it. The 4 stars is only because of the noise level."
5,A concise guide for students and researchers.,"This book gives the reader a basic foundation for understanding statistical analysis using generalized linear models (GLMs), focusing on the specialized cases of logistic regression and log-linear models. Concepts are clearly presented and accompanied by figures and appropriate examples. Hypothesis testing and test statistics are carefully outlined by the author. This is the most readable and useful statistics text I have encountered, and should be an invaluable resource to anyone dealing with categorical response data."
2,"Remove 1/3 of Agresti's big book, and you have this one.","Agresti took most of the material from his big book, _Categorical Data Analysis_, and took out all the justifications. What's left is _An Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis_, and no math. If you enjoy having results fed to you so that you can memorise then, read this book. Otherwise, I concur with the other reader: buy this book's big brother."
5,A great reference!,"Agresti's book 'Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis' has been very valuable for my research and understanding of logistics regression techniques. I am not a statistics major and so I greatly appreciate his use of examples to discuss the concepts. Rather than getting lost in equations with tons of vectors and matrices, Agresti's book focuses on the core concepts and methodologies you need to prepare your data, set up the models and interpret the results. The companion webpage has the SAS code for most of the examples so you can replicate what he did. Highly Recommended!"
2,Not so hot Neil Diamond,The video recording is not worth to be a blu-ray or HD DVD. Any amateur can do a better audio recording.
4,It's excellent!!!,"Neil Diamond puts on a great live concert - it was good to finally see one. He's definitely comfortable and at ease in front of an audience. When I first wrote my review I hadn't watched much of the concert. I was able to see more of it last night and it's wonderful. Neil is so pumped and the audience obviously just loves him. Even my 23 year old son loved it, and he is not usually into that kind of music. Definitely worth the money - I'm sure everyone will enjoy it."
3,Is it time?,"While I was excited to be able to see & hear Neil Diamond on my Blu-ray player, I have to admit it was the old hits I grew up with that I was expecting to hear. Where he belted 'em out with power and passion. The songs with heart.What I got, was disappointment. Not with the quality of the picture or sound, mind you (though I had read about some issues there...); I was actually disappointed in Neil's Performance. He seems to have lost some of his power onstage. Oh, he still has his passion for his music, and it's there in the lyrics, but his presence onstage seemed ""lackluster""."" Admittedly, I was expecting 70's/80's Neil, and this is just not him.Now, if they would just remaster & release the Hot August Nights video from the 70's... THAT would be worth the money."
5,Extremely Satisfied,"I watched the concert at someone's house, and had to have it.I went to Amazon and placed an order for one for myself and twofor friends, and I'm very pleased with the whole process."
3,A little disappointed,"I love Neil, but was a little sad that he didn't do the Hot August Night album version. My all-time favorite song is Holly Holy and I loved the extended, powerful version on the album. But, on this dvd, he cut it really short. Just didn't do it for me."
4,Neil Diamond in NYC,"I am pretty sure I have bought EVERY ALBUM NEIL DIAMOND HAS MADE. I absolutely adore Neil Diamond's Music so much, I painted a Portrait of him and delivered it, via ""Security People"", when I attended one of his Concerts years ago.While I enjoyed this Album very much, I was TRYING to get Neil's ORIGINAL HOT AUGUST NIGHT ALBUM, RECORDED LIVE, AT THE GREEK THEATER IN LA. many years ago, ON A DVD. UNFORTUNATELY, it was only available on VHS. I think it would be very smart of his Producers, if they would somehow get this ""Original"" ""Hot August Night"" from those early years and MARKET IT ON A DVD. I will keep hoping that this will happen before I die!"
2,Poor Audio,"What do you buy a blu ray musical performance for? Good video? yes, but you probably get it for the lossless audio track. The TrueHD track on this disc is very poor. It is more like 3.0 rather than 5.1. And the center channel is carrying at least 80-90% of the 3.0. The rear channels are non-existant. The stereo mix is brighter and has a better mix out of the front 3 channels. If you like Neil just get the DVD.The video is good and the concert is superb like all of his concerts are. It is just that the disc is bad. I have over sixty blu-ray and HD DVD concert discs. This audio mix is one of the worst, similar to some of the first to come out 4-5 years ago. Rating purely on the audio. I would have given it one but Neil is outstanding."
3,Agreed... Poor Audio,"I agree with ""Billy."" It defaulted to two channel audio and when I switched to Dolby TrueHD, I was disappointed.I was also disappointed by the ""filming,"" rather than video like the Elton John and Moody Blues Blu-ray DVDs.All that technical complaining aside, my wife LOVED the concert, and she has been a Neil Diamond fan for decades and has seen him live MANY times.The bonus 23 minutes was interesting. He goes back to where he grew up as an early teen."
3,Disappointed,"I took great pains to review this concert on Amazon and am throughly disappointed in the music. ND still produces the same old magic with his vocals. My all time favorite number is ""Song Sung Blue"", especially the version from THE ""Hot August Night"" album. Bringing in female support vocals in this recent concert, killed it for me. I actually shut down my system after the first few lines. I had watched the entire video until then, eagerly looking forward to drowning in his rendition of ""Song Sung Blue""....... the less said the better. I am going to stick to the Good 'ol ND and my CD's. I have over 50 DVD concert's from Rock to Blues. This is the very first concert that I feel like throwing away.Whatever I have written here is my very own opinion and not meant to influence anyones decision on buying this DVD. The video quality is great (with HDMI) and the sound is ok."
2,Audio just sucks.,"As a long time fan since the 70's, I expected a good mix, but this recording even though is was dts 5.1 sounded like an 8 track. The other reviewers who said it was great, need to go to BELTONE! I have no problems with picture quality, or the great song selection. I can even live with the tacky""everybody see me!"" stage. sound is muffled, mix very compressed. All the more disapointing when considering the great song list.I bought this at the same time as Chicago/Earth,Wind and Fire live @ the Greek. recorded 4 years earlier. Huge, vibrant, dynamic sound!"
3,Only contains mixes from the first & second album,"Dunno, I thought a 5 disc set would have a little more variety. Don't get me wrong, it's good. It's just that it only covers one phase of the band's history. I admit it should've been obvious since the product is published by ZTT, which only owns the first two albums Into Battle..., and Who's Afraid... So that's what it is, it's a bunch of alternate versions of the stuff from those two albums. In other words, its like a ""Daft"" remix album. That being said, the interview/comment booklet that comes with it is great, and you get a real sense of what was happening and not being said during their work on ZTT. (Still I wish there was away to score some of the lost work from In Visible Silence, and In No Sense? Nonsense! -- Mrs. Dudely? Can you hear me? Now that you're super-successful as a composer with the BBC, can you pull a few strings and get the lost recordings out?"
3,"Huge AON Fan, but ......","I am a HUGE Art of Noise fan. I think I've picked up everything from Bashful to the latest Remix album. I was really expecting to hear something I hadn't heard before. Most of the tracks are the already on other albums in various forms. There are a few new sounds or additions, but not nearly enough. Disc 4 was basically Into the Battle...At this point, I'll hold out for the group getting back together again."
3,Good performance Poor reliability,The drill has adequate power although reliability has been very poor. After 6 months the clutch had to be replaced which Makita handled under warranty. In 9 more months the clutch went out again. They did replace the drill but within 2 weeks one of the batteries quit. I now have purchased a new battery but the second one goes dead very quickly. Will most likely never own another.
2,Buyer Beware of a Issue!,"CBS, who owned the rights on the pilot refused to come to an arrangement for its usage on this DVD set! Therefore Mill Creek Entertainment has been forced to NOT include it on the DVD. All other episodes will be there. CBS has succeeded in making me as mad as hell. Its a 30 year old program being released to a budget-priced DVD! What do they care anymore?! So the pilot, which explains what you need to know about the show, is gone. There is a man on youtube, user id chuckcollins, who is planning on posting the pilot that he has from an old recording. So I guess for the price you could watch the pilot on youtube then enjoy the rest. Its what I plan to do, but I'm mad at CBS for screwing this up for everybody"
1,NO PILOT TO THE SHOW !,I JUST ORDERED MY COPY OF THE COMPLETE COLLECTION ONLY ONE PROBLEM IT IS NOT THE COMPLETE COLLECTION AND I AM WARNING ALL WHO WANT TO BUY IT! THEY ARE MISSING THE PILOT MOVIE THAT STARTED THE WHOLE SHOW!! SAD MILLCREEK DID THIS TO PEOPLE AGAIN! ( BUT THEY ADVERTISE JAYNE MEADOWS ON IT'S BOX BUT SHE WAS ONLY IN THE PILOT!) THEY HAVE ONLY 12 EPISODES AND IF THEY HAD THE COMPLETE SERIES IT WOULD BE A TOTAL OF 13 BUT IT'S NOT! I GET TIRED OF MILL CREEK PUTTING OUT SHOWS LIKE THESE AND PUTTING ONLY SEVERAL SEASON OF A WHOLE SHOW OUT THEN RELEASE IT OUT IN THE COMPLETE SERIES LIKE HUNTER AND RENAGADE AND NOT FINISHING THE REST OF THE SERIES IN SEPERATE SEASON SETS! :0( JUST BE WARNED THAT TENSPEED AND BROWN SHOE IS NOT A COMPLETE SERIES SET!
5,I was in the Original Pilot.,I was a Extra in the Original Pilot Playing a Venezalan Soccer Player. I was payed Scale but it was a lot of fun. I taped the Original Pilot off of cable a few years ago.
1,Just Awful,Goldblum's character is preening and spastic. Vereen's supposedly smooth cons are utterly unconvincing. The plots and dialogue are terrible. There are no laughs unless Gilligan's Island is your favorite show. And the music sucks too.
3,"It works, but not for long.",I'll keep it short and simple.This works fine on my Panasonic KX-TG5480. My problem with this is the same as all the other NiMH batteries I've had for this phone. They simply don't last.So it's 5 stars for the fact that it works and 1 star for its lack of useful life. Average it to 3 stars.
1,...,"GOT THIS [POORLY MADE] PAPER SHREDDER AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT - FROM MY BARGIN HUNTER SISTER - BROKE ON THE FIRST USAGE - WHEN I WENT ON LINE TO SEE IF THERE WAS MUCH COST INVOLVE - I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN IT WOULD BE THE [WORST] SHREDDER THERE, NOT EVEN WORTH THE SHIPPING CHARGES."
4,Very happy with it so far,"I recently purchased one of these because it is cheaper than what the office supply stores now offer, which is the shredder with a trash container. I used it this past weekend. Had no problems whatsoever. In reading the other reviews I wonder if these other people read the manual where is states to only use it for 5 minutes at a time and then to let it rest for 15 minutes. Some people probably find that inconvenient, but I have no problem in following that."
4,Heron Decoy,"I purchased this blue heron decoy for my koi pond in South Florida. So far, no fish loss. The decoy was just like it was described on Amazon so I'm happy with it."
1,Didn't work,"We bought this heron to protect the fish in our ponds. Three different herons have come by in the last couple of months. One of them seemed bothered and left after just one visit, but the other two weren't fazed in the least. They'd just walk right by it on their way to a good fishing spot. See my photo under ""customer images"" above."
4,Blue Heron does the job.,The decoy works but you must change it's position often. More often during the mating season. I installed a motion sensor light along with the decoy and that seamed to improve the overall efectiviveness.
3,Don't waste your money..heron's aren't dumb!,"Bought this heron decoy to try and keep the real heron's out of our koi fish pond. We were losing way too many of our prized Koi to these long legged thiefs. I placed it around our pond and alternated where I put it, to trick the heron. HA HA...I opened our blinds one early morning only to find a REAL heron walking right past the fake heron to our pond, to go fishing. I scared it away. But needless to say, if I hadn't of opened the blinds when I did, we would have lost more Koi. My poor Koi are already freaked out and basically living under the rocks. I just got them coaxed out and relaxed, when the heron shows up again. I will be sending this back. Think I am resorting to the netting and a water blaster. Hopefully the water blaster will keep the cats out of my yard too!"
2,"Looks good, doesn't work","I change the location of my ""Heron"" everyday and still I find a real heron in my pond almost every morning. I guess it was worth a try, its back to netting the pond at night for me."
3,blue heon decoy they dont work,"The Blue Heron Decoys do not work, Live Blue Herons walk right up to the decoy and go in my pond and eat my Koi Fish. Not real happy with the results Have lost over 10 fish since putting the decoy up."
3,Unfeeling performance by Harnoncourt,"This same material is better suited under the able direction of Jordi Savall and his numerous cds of French Baroque music.The notes are all there with Harnoncourt,but the feeling is removed once the wrap comes off the cd.Look elsewhere-especially to Savall for interpretation."
3,The best themes are missing,"All round this is a good CD, with the exception that two very prominent themes in the episode are not featured on the CD. The theme from the introduction of Voyager by the pilot Stadi, and the theme for when the ship disengages from Deep Space Nine and launches are both missing - quite frankly I dont understand why. The ship launching surely is one of the most stand out moments of the series, so don't ask me why its not on the soundtrack."
5,The best,"this cd was the best cd i have ever listened to. i think that if you like voyager, you should definetly get this cd."
1,pressed particle leather,"I just got this leash today and I am very disappointed. It is not ""real"" leather, but rather a pressed particle leather. I will be giving this to the SPCA, and would not recommend."
5,The Skull Man Review,The box set was in descent shape for being used. The DVD's are clean and not as scratched up as I thought they would be. So far everything seams to be reading fine when I play them.
1,junk worthless,the steak knives are butter knives and the carving knife is as sharp as a brick: pure junk I have thrown it all in the trash!
5,Nice price. Very good scanner.,"I'm not a power user for flatbed scanners. I use mine for scanning in photographs and documents. It is great for scanning in old family photographs where only one copy exists.It was real easy to install. The PaperPort Deluxe software is very good. The USB hookup works great because I don't leave mine plugged in all the time. The scanning resolution is awesome. If you scan in a photograph at maximum resolution, the file size will be huge. I usually scan stuff at a much lower resolution.I haven't used the OCR capabilities or any of the other options. I like the price, I haven't had any problems with it, and it meets all my scanning needs."
5,The Original. Accept no Substitutes!,"I'd nearly forgotten about this superb work from the incomparable Dominic Frontiere. This music, as much as anything else, is what gave the original Outer Limits its ""creep factor"" which terrified me so when I was little. (My mother usually refused to let me watch the show then just for that reason!).In addition to OL, Mr Frontiere also scored such 60's TV shows such as ""That Girl"" and ""The Flying Nun"". (Anyone who's music can make such a whimsical premise as a flying nun seem wonderful is a talented composer indeed! )It's been a long time coming, but well worth the wait. Hats off to Neil Norman, and especially to Dom Frontiere."
3,Good but missing something,"This is a good album. However, what is missing is the music from Harry Lubin who scored the music from the second season. There have been rumors of his music being seen on an old LP however no one has been able to locate a copy. This is very unfortunate. The music in this series is so far above what is produced in most series today."
3,only half the music,"love the music by dominic frontiere, but there seems to be a part 2 or even three missing. where is the music from zanti misfits, invisible enimy, demon with glass hand, etc. half of music from series is missing."
3,Disappointing!,"Though it had the main theme song, there were choice bits of sound effects and mood music left out, the ones I remember the best. I'm still waiting for them to come out with volume 2; maybe it will contain the missing vital sound tracks?"
1,Unavailable,"I cannot recommend that you order this CD since it was never sent to me.After an inexplicable delay of two months following an online order in January, I was informed that another delay would make this item unavailable until sometime in April.No explanation was given.Apparently the CD is advertised here but don't expect to get it anytime soon.I found the entire experience frustrating, unhelpful and dishonest to say the least."
2,Boy does this suck,"I did not expect this CD to be better than the real ones.. but come on. Nearly all of the tracks sound as if they were knocked off of a synth/keyboard/comptuer. This could be a good thing... but the person (persons) playing these themes must have a tin ear.UFO sounds as if it was from a puppet series.I-Spy is horrible.The country themes all seem to start off with the same ""cowboys and cows"" rustling in the background.In 3 words: A LAME EFFORT.Do not buy unless you are tone deaf.GENE"
2,Not Perfect,"This product is good if you have the white bumps under your eyes. The retinol seemed to really help reduce them. The lotion itself is very dry, I had to put another eye cream on top otherwise my eyes looked very old and dry. It is unlike its claim that it hydrates the skin."
3,Adequate and inexpensive,"My son liked these shoes, but the tongue of the shoes did not stay in place very well. Most soccer shoes have holes in the tongue to tie it in place with the laces, but these did not. He plays AYSO soccer, and they were fine for his needs, but may not be the best choice for a child who playes more soccer."
3,Corey Stevens - 'Road To Zen' (Eureka),"A lot of you out there probably think that Corey Stevens is JUST another Stevie Ray Vaughan wanna-be.To a degree,you're right about that.I noticed that on 'Road To Zen'(his second effort),Stevens seems to explore other musical areas,perhaps like a more funky side.Some of the tunes I thought were okay are ""Too Much Fun"",""My Neighborhood"",""Big House Blues"" and ""Take It Back"".Might appeal to fans of Kenny Wayne Shephard,Jonny Lang and Mike Welch.Give it a listen,see what you think."
5,It's just a great CD,W/ his Clapton and Stevie Ray Vaughan style this is one of Corey's best CDs.Road to Zen was the hit here but this CD doesn't slow down and just amazing guitar playing.It's just a great CD.
2,"Stevens did not travel far enough down the ""Road to Zen""","Stevens work is interesting but lacks heart. The tracks mostly seem forced from a country feel into a blues motiff, and despite the wonderful work of Mississippi Slim on the seventh track ""Take it Back"" the overall work lacks a true bluesy feel. In short, Stevens latest blues album is a great country/western CD but a less than must have for a blues fan."
2,Compared to 1st CD... this 1 falls way short!!!,I purchased Corey Stevens 1st CD and was 110% impressed... you'd swear SRV was alive and well!!! If he'd stick to his roots like his 1st album... he's on his way... this 2nd CD falls terribly short compared to the 1st... Man sounds like he's on an ego trip... Get back Jo-Jo to your 1st CD!!!
5,A must read and have Fly Fishing book...,"Ok, this book was written long before many of us were even round, but HP Wells wasreally on top of his game. If you fly fish, tye your own flies and/or make your own rods then you have to read this book. This book really shows when men were men and there was a fine (finer than today) appreciation of the ART of rod making, fly dressing, and exquisite tackle. We don't know what we have until we have read about Mr Wells' and his story. This was the guy that the famous rod grip was named after. Plus, since the book is leather bound, you can lay it around the house and it looks good without snobbing their nose at ""a fishin book?""."
2,Go with Sony Brand,I bought this controller and the analog joystick broke after the first use. I bought the Sony brand dualshock analog controller and I have not had a problem since.
1,bad controller,basically this controller stinks(in otherwards Don't buy it from anywhere) my dad got it for me and I guess he didn't now anything about it. the if i push up it acts like X the only good thing is that it is comfortable and affordable
3,"Not bad, but not the best either","Its nice, I'm 6' tall, so the regular sony controllers are too small for my hands, this one fits comfortably. L and R buttons aren't very solid, one of them has broken but still works ok."
3,Kinda Cool But Different From PSX Standard,"I like this design because it seems a bit more comfortable to hold but the buttons are spaced differently and I hope the touch sensitivity is as good as the original equipment....we are talking about the game-pad, right? ;) Worth trying out."
2,"Comfortable to hold, but breaks quickly","I bought a total of four of these - on two of them, the R1 button broke in less than an hour of their first use. Another one has something broken inside, which rattles when it is in use - it hasn't stopped working yet, but is annoying.On the plus side, it is much more comfortable for me, since it is sized more for an adult than the standard Sony controller, and has a softer gamepad control for the d-pad. Sony's controller has four separate buttons for the d-pad, which makes it harder on the thumbs over time.All in all, they aren't worth the money."
2,Stick with the original gamepad,This gamepad may have its good points but nothing to compare to the original. The poor quality of this product shows from its fragile control sticks to its flimsy analog buttons. I have owned two and both broke within a week. Stay away from these third party manufacturers and pay the extra buck for original PS2 products.
2,"Ok, But not the best","I bought this controler for my PS1 and it works just as well as it would for a PS2, but that's about where the good points end. It has strong vibration feedback, but it is so noisy when it vibrates, someone could hear it in the next room. Also, when you first turn on the system, the analog will spontaniously turn off. And another thing, the controler's anlog stick's grips are very slippery when they get sweat on them, wich makes it very hard to manuver around in a game. In my opinion, spend your [money] on somthing better. WAY better."
1,Not the best but works.,"It's really big and vibrates alot! The first week I got it, one of the anologs broke off and I had to glue it back on. Just the other day, my R2 button broke off. Its not a very good controller, but if you like things that vibrate alot, then it's just for you."
1,It's Okay,"I bought this controller and thought it was da bomb! Then I wrapped it up to take it somewhere and it stopped working! I had to sit down and make sure the wire was streched out completely or it would wouldn't work! So if you like sitting completely still while your playing, go ahead and buy it."
5,Keeper Material!,"Don't let the cover of this book fool you. It's about a hero who ""walks off the page"". He's neither east nor west, but both. Add the romance to this historical adventure, and you have a real keeper."
5,Awesome!,"These strings are awesome - they're the only strings I use. Light on the bottom for easy soloing, heavy on the top for monster riffing. The thickness of the lower strings makes playing feel very comfortable and easy. These strings also seem to last quite a bit longer than others such as Ernie Ball, and still sound okay even after you've had them on for a while and need to change them. I really wish these were available in stores, but I like these enough to pay extra to buy them online and have them shipped to me. Don't let the price discourage you - these are well worth the money."
2,Disappointing stuff from both Williams & Courage,I like a few of the Williams tracks. Such as GIANT'S EYE. With that trumpet passage that's later taken up by the flute. HIDDEN GUN benefits from the electric-piano echoplex or whatever the heck it is. But then those french horns come blasting in again to annoy the crap out of me. There's too much empty french-horn blowhardism from Williams. Courage's score is actually preferable if only because it's easier on the ear. It's dependably loaded with those Courage-esque chromatic brass descensions.
5,Most accessible Strangers album,"While ""Rank Strangers"" (aka Red Square) may be their best album, ""Consumption"" is the most accessible of their many releases due to its more pop-music slanted songs. The other reviewer has correctly identified some of the highlights of the album, but the opening track ""Smash It!"" should definitely be added to the list.The final two tracks of the album foreshadow the tone and direction of the two albums which followed ""Consumption"": ""Red Square"" and ""I Only Fear That We Are Modern,"" both of which feature more obscure, diverse songs, many of which have a neurotically pessimistic quality about them.The only way to really experience this band is to see them live, but seeing as they play somewhat infrequently and even then mostly in and around the Twin Cities, ""Consumption"" might be the best introduction to this odd and overlooked band. Highly recommended."
4,Very enjoyable and for under five bucks...,"This bargain entry performed by Walter Susskind and the Cincinnati Symphony serves Mahler's song cycle well. Those not totally attracted to orchestrated song narratives but wanting to round out their collection need not pay more. We are given competent performances by contalto, Lillian Chookasian and tenor, Richard Cassilly. The remastered 1978 modern recording is transparently clear and natural. There are surely legends available who have peformed these adaptions of Chinese poems, thus my 4 star rating. Program notes and translated texts are provided."
4,Interesting Journey into Anti-Smoking Hysteria,"This book is quite interesting in that it takes on one of the 1990's most sacred cows, anti-smoking. The author is very logical and makes excellent points all through the book. The only problem with is the fact that he tends to stray from the point he's trying to make. This book is very important for anyone wishing to know more about the ""smoking wars"" going on now in America. A warning for those who dismiss this book and the author's warnings of tyranny: The things you like (high-fat food, alcohol, etc.) could very well be in the same boat as cigarrettes some day in the not-too-distant future."
5,"Well-written, comprehensive, and knowledgeable.","This is an excellent book, which takes about as objective a tone as one is likely to find anywhere these days on this contentious issue. I read it from cover to cover (not in one sitting!) and found it brimming with information both current and historical. The author applies properly skeptical reasoning with regard to the many ""facts"" that are bandied about, and, as a statistics instructor, I was particularly pleased to see someone write so knowledgeably and clearly about statistical issues. A very well-written and comprehensive book."
4,Star Trek,Not the best Star Trek Album but has some great tunes. It seems a little predictable and repediative sometimes though the main theme seems to warm my heart when it kicks in.
3,AutoRip a jip!,"First, briefly, the score itself. While there are a few notable tracks, particularly ""A Christmas Hug"" (which, along with the scene, bring tears to my eyes every time), and some good action music, mostly the score sounds like a TV score (i.e., canned like the music from TNG or any of the other TV spinoffs of Star Trek) rather than a big budget theatrical film score a la Goldsmith or Horner.Second, I was jipped on the so-called AutoRip feature. The tracks that show up in Amazon Cloud Player are only those of the standard 1998 CD, not the expanded Collector's Edition!"
5,Simple beauty!!!,"Comfortable and plain...If you're into blinding, eyeball-popping ""bling-bling"" this isn't for you; but if you're about subtle, classy, understated elegance, this should fit the bill perfectly. And how 'bout that price??!!!"
5,A delightful show...,"The setting is lovely - nations, more like city-states, use airships and formal rules of combat to fight battles. The battles are overseen by the Guild. The artwork is perfect, the characters real and the soundtrack is awesome. The main characters are two vanship pilots who deliver letters - Claus and Lavie.The plot becomes twisted when it seems that the Guild have their own ideas about which side should win - it seems one nation holds a girl they want. And want bad.The air battles are amazing, with much of the effects done by computers. The English voices of Crispin Freeman, Tony Oliver, Steve Kramer and Lex Lang are just some of the stars you will hear. Each disc has four episodes and some extras, but the big plus is the unfolding story. It really hooks you and keeps you watching. This isn't anime, this is art."
5,Worth It!,"Last Exile is definitely worth the purchase. If you are familiar with Trigun, Hellsing or Cowboy Bebop, you may enjoy hearing a lot familiar voice actors(the voices of Vash the Stampede and Meryl Stryfe from Trigun and Alucard from Hellsing are among main characters). The world of Last Exile is that of a non-computerized future which revolves heavily upon air travel. It has a great balance of action and character development and mystery with an awesome score to accompany it. Last Exile lives up to what you would expect of a cojoint effort by Gonzo, Pioneer, and JVC."
5,"We Wanted the Blessing Force, We Got the Blessing Force","They finally did it... an album that captures the intensity of their live shows, without excluding the aesthetic discretion found on their previous studio work. While some may be disappointed that it isn't as 'quiet' of a release as their first self-titled album, I'm of the opinion that this is their finest recording to date. Brilliant song writing, inventive performances, and quite possibly the best collection of songs released this year (2007). Simply put this is a ""must have"" for anyone interested in creative rock / folk music (i.e. Pink Floyd, Neil Young, Incredible String Band, Eloy, Can, etc).The bonus DVD has some excellent performances as well, though the sound quality may limit its appeal to fans already familiar with their material."
3,"Overpriced, but useful","The high point of Selby's Dark City is a filmography of 490 classic film noir titles. Each entry includes a brief synopsis as well as information on the film's year of release, studio, producer, director, main actors, and running time. All told, this filmography provides an excellent supplement to Silver and Ward's Encyclopedia of Film Noir.Aside from the filmography, however, Dark City has little else to recommend it. The quality of the book's photos, typography, and editing are all poor. Even worse, Selby provides an in-depth discussion of 25 films, but his prose comes off as an amateurish attempt at academic writing.In light of these flaws, and the fact that the book is less than 200 pages (not counting the appendices and indices), Dark City seems excessively overpriced.I consider Selby's filmography an excellent resource, but it's not worth the list price of the book. If such a resource appeals to you, I recommend you do what I did: buy a used copy."
5,That's Amore,This book was an absolute ***BLAST***Loved it from beginning to end.Many Thanks to Ricci for sharing with all of us in this fine book.
3,SON ALSO RISES ...NOT.,"RICCI MARTIN SEEMS LIKE A REAL NICE GUY , BUT THIS BOOK ON HIS DAD IS ONLY OK..IT SHOWS HIS LOVE FOR HIS DAD AND MOM AND THATS GREAT, BUT ITS WRITTEN LIKE AN EIGHT YEAR OLD TYPED IT UP. I GUESS HIS WRITER WAS UNTALENTED.THE ONE THING THAT BOTHERS ME OF THESE BOOKS IS THAT THE OFF SPRING DONT KNOW ANYTHING OF THEIR DADS CAREER.JUST LIKE THE CASH KIDS AND THE CROSBY KIDS AND THE SINATRA BROOD THEY DONT KNOW THEIR DADS CAREER SO THEY MAKE IT UP.IN THIS BOOK HE WRITES HIS DADS BEST BUD MACK GRAY WHO ALWAYS CARRIED A LARGE MANILA ENVELOPE HAD CIGARS INSIDE.THIS IS LUDICROUS!!! EVERYONE KNOWS AND HIS SISTER KNOWS THAT MACK GRAY CARRIED PERCODAN AND PERCOSET AND OTHER BARBITUTES THAT SADLY DEAN NEEDED THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE.IF YOU ARE GOING TO WRITE A BOOK TELL THE TRUTH.STILL I WOULD RECCOMEND THE BOOK."
1,boring,"Boring book written by or for a son who seems more interested in his inane childhood antics rather than much at all about his famous father ,more an excuse to advance his own very limited importance !"
3,Dean's later years,"This book is written by Dean's son from his second marriage, Ricci. Simply because Ricci was born later in Dean's life, it doesn't cover as much about Dean as I would like. What is covered is the life Ricci had with his parents and siblings, four of whom were from Dean's first wife and who had seen little of their father for a number of years before he took custody. I am happy to know that Ricci has mostly good things to say about his dad, but his was a different experience then the one his four half siblings had with their dad. You have to read Dina Martin's book also to get a more balanced view of Dean as a parent. There were lengthy descriptions of Ricci's toys and exploits that really didn't involve his father at all and for me, could have be left out of the book."
2,Less than mediocre...,"As a semi-retired residential building contractor, I have a lot of tools. I use them mostly to renovate my own house (a work in progress)and to build some outdoor furniture. Every shop needs a jig saw. This one is well made, typical of Makita but very basic. For a little more money, you can buy a jig saw that has more control options, and is easier to handle.I have a band saw that I use for most things that require curve cuts. Occasionally I break out the Makita, if I need to make a curve cut on something I can't bring to the band saw.The machine works, but I never enjoy using it. Too much vibration.I recall paying about $75 for it. If I was buying a new jig saw, I'd double that budget, and buy something that was more sophisticated."
5,Hubby loves this jigsaw,"Got this for my hubby for Christmas and he loves it.. It works great. Makita is a good brand. He has found no problems at all in using this jigsaw. It has good power and it has guards so the blade does not bend when cutting..I think you will like it, I recommend this highly."
2,Thanks for warning,Thanks for the heads up. I almost bought the printer until I read the reviews. Sounds like a headache to me.
2,WAS Ok...Until it Broke!,"This is the printer that I received with my new Dell. I was happy with it. It worked fine for a the first few months, but all of a sudden the paper started misfeeding (dragging it in only from the right side) and for the life of me, I cannot figure out how to fix it.I went to the Dell site and they have crap for troubleshooting (well for this particular problem anyway.) As a result, I searched for anyone who has had a similar problem and that would be able to help me fix my printer. I found a message board that discussed this exact problem on more than one Dell printer. The only solution anyone had found to work was to fold up a piece of paper and jam it in between the side of the feeder and the alignment thing. That didn't work, so now I am on Amazon looking for its replacement. When I saw this, I thought I should share my complete and utter disappointment with this printer. It would be a good deal if they could fix that feeder problem."
1,Biggest piece of junk ever!,"This is by far the worst printer I have ever had. Besides its numerous mechanical deficiencies, you must order ink from Dell online and it costs more than for other brands. Stay away!"
2,Baaadddd Printer...,"I got this printer with my Dell computer, has trouble loading paper, does scan very well, was ok until printer cartridge ran out, to replace it's very expensive."
1,Glad I'm Not the Only One,"I had a basic Epson inkjet that worked better after 5 years than this printer does after--er, actually, before it even begins. It can't handle anything except standard printer papers (so don't try to get creative with your card stocks or anything heavier). The ink cartridges are awful and require manual cleaning w/ a Q-tip after about every use and still NEVER get fully cleaned. For the price of two sets of ink cartridges, you could get a better printer than this. Would give it 0 stars if I could. It's an utter failure of a product. Dell should pay me for the space it takes up on my computer stand."
1,Don't buy this printer!!!,"This is the worst printer I've owned...worked okay at first (not great, not fast, just okay). Ink is ridiculously overpriced, and only available from them. Paper starts to drag from 1 side...not fizable. Then it will start to print colors a little ""Off"" with no way to adjust for more red, blue, etc. Then it printes blurry, or spotty, or prints big blobs of ink, even though it says it full and you put in a new cartridge.Doesn't allow you to make any adjustments, they just tell you to put in a new cartridge, and their only solution is to run a nozzle cleaning, which uses up ENORMOUS amounts of ink.Sigh.Find another printer...this one's not worth it."
3,Nice way to first hear the Helen Keller story,"This is an easy to read book (grades 1 & 2) and a wonderful tool for introducing children to Helen Keller. It tells about her struggles after becoming deaf and blind, and of her eventual triumph of learning words with the help of her teacher, Anne Sullivan. It also gives a very brief summary of her accomplishments as an adult.I think it's great for kids to learn about Helen Keller, and this book provides a nice way to first hear the story.The last page of the book has a sign language alphabet chart which some children might enjoy trying to learn..."
5,Best replacement cord for the price!,"First of all, I got this because I, let's just say, ""broke"" my original PS2 cord. Just a little background story. It is what it says it is: a Playstation 2 replacement cord. I must add that it does it's job very well at it's price, surprisingly. If you have a damaged or horribly irreparable cord and you must get your hands on a new, and as a matter of fact, inexpensive one, I'd definitely recommend this. No complaints so far, it's been working just fine."
3,Quick Replacement,"This cable works good as a quick, cheap replacement for a lost or broken AV for PS1 or PS2. However as a long term replacement, I wouldn't recommend it unless you're comfortable with the cheap quality of the cord itself."
5,Does what it should,Does what it should for an inexpensive replacement. Shipped quickly. Would recommend this when your OE breaks. It's only PS2 not 1080p
3,"CHEAP KNOCK OFF, BUT STILL WORKS","No quality, looks cheap, but for the price its hard to complain. I bought just to put with a ps2 console to resell, so the price was alot cheaper than buying an original AV cable. But if I was buying for myself I would of spent a few extra dollars to ensure I had a high quality Sony made product, instead of this light weight cheap quality cable. But on the other hand it works fine and I never ran across any problems with it! I just prefer quality for myself :)"
4,No issues,"I know others have complained, but these work just fine for us and at a super price. Can't beat it..."
3,Horrible Quality,"This is NOT the original cable for any of the playstation consoles. The quality just looks straight out cheap.It works, though, and it's cheap, so I can place a larger profit on this item, as long as it works, but if you have the money get a higher quality or original Sony AV Cable."
1,Cheaply made - broke our TV outlets!,"At first, this cord worked as it should, which was great. But a week later, the dog (a small puppy) tripped over the cord and all three pins broke off inside the TV video outlets! The cord was plugged into the front TV outlets, with lots of slack so it wasn't tight. We've tried tweezers, needle nose pliers, but the pins are so far in, the front outlets are now completely useless. We have a busy household of kids with multiple devices that use AV cable cords. This has never happened with any other cord - ever!Spend the money for the real deal."
1,Terrible Quality,"I received this product in a timely manner. That is all that I can say that is positive about it. I tried plugging it in, and the quality is terrible, like the wires inside have been bent or cut. I connected it to multiple t.v.'s and got the same result each time. Don't buy it, it's a waste of money."
3,Adequate,"It is a generic cord, does its job. However, the plastic casing around the plug that goes into the PS2 feels flimsy."
5,Works great!,"Replacement for a lost one. It was not bulk tho, the just one.Arrived in a reasonable amount of time."
1,Works fine but....,"This cable works fine, but it is not needed for the PS2. If you look in the box, you will find a similar cable. If you lose yours or it breaks or something, then you should probaly get this. Its stupid to buy 2."
2,A peak into world of Forex - same info free on the web,Just finished the Forex made easy and it did not take long.Although this book may be very good for people who are completely new to FOREX the author does not present any new revolutionary ideas on how to trade FOREX. The book just manages to scracth the surface and introuduce different aspects related to FOREX trading.I was able to find the same info (another reader also mentiones this) and even more detailed for free on the web.A big drawback to this book is that the author seems to send out the message that as long as you have the right charts etc. you can become a successful traders and only briefly mentiones the mental side of trading.So if you are new to FOREX you might be abel to get a peak into the world of FOREX but reading this book won't make you an ace trader.
1,Sales advertisement not a book,"This book systematically peps you up and leads you to buy his software and alert system. There are better books, avoid this one. There should be a category in PUBLISHING called ""INFOMERCIAL""."
2,Marginal amount of information,"This book gives the layperson the most superficial of insights into the forex and a quick lesson in some extremely basic technical analysis of charts. But the book really does read as an advertisement for the author's website/company services. A person looking to really learn would be better off reading Raghee Horner's new book or ""Forex for the small speculator""."
3,good book,"This book has lots of good information on getting started in trading currency but it seems to be written for people who already know the lingo and terminology. If you have no idea what forex is then this isn't the book for you. Some chapters are confusing and it seems to list more than 6 ways to trade. It's not clear what the ""6 Ways to Trade the Dollar"" are. That's why I gave this book 3 stars. It's good but could've been better."
1,Nothing you can't Google,"I read this book. A friend new to Forex gave me his copy and asked what I thought.I read it. I believe it to be honest, straight forward but VERY basic. Which is fine, but you can get all the contents of this book and more if you use Google and read many of the free materials most of the big brokers have to give away to tempt you to open an account with them.If you do not have internet access (now...how you will trade Forex without live charts streaming to you is beyond me !!!) then this is a good read."
1,Sale pitch,"I am a professional stock and options trader interested in exploring the Forex. Mr. Dicks has written a book designed to make the reader a customer of his Forex brokerage. A significant portion of the book is directed to instructions on how to navigate his web site. His explanations of certain important orders (stop loss and limit) are confusing and poor. His trading rules are worthwhile but can be found in almost any book on trading, Forex or otherwise. Overall, the book is a sales pitch for Mr. Dicks other enterprises. In my opinion it is not worth reading."
1,Rubbish,"After reading much of this book at my local bookstore, I did some online investigation of the author. Guys like him give me the impression that they think it's morally wrong NOT to lie. The author is nothing but a con artist and this book is one of the worst pieces of garbage I have found in the business category."
1,An advertisement sold as a book,"This book offers no knowledge about FX, although its title would lead you to believe otherwise. This book is a 256-page advertisement, although its title would lead to believe otherwise. (I could keep going)The 5-star reviews were obviously from friends/relatives/book sale stakeholders. FYI - after being suckered into buying this, I noticed that the only book-flap hyperboles are quotes from the author himself! (Books always have at least one critic write how ""great"" the book is on the flaps)"
1,"Disguised sales pitch, not worth the money","A word of advice: run, don't walk, run from this crap. It's a sales brochure for his simplistic trading system.Briefly, by his own admission, the author is a failed forex trader, then almost bankrupted himself riding CISCO from 90 to 20, joined Marines, and is currently peddling a simplistic trading system to make a living. If these are results you would like to duplicate, go ahead and buy the book.The only reason I even bothered to write this review is because I am disgusted at the fact McGraw-Hill stooped low enough to publish it. As another reviewer points out, the fact that Dick's data provider owns McGraw-Hill may have something to do with it."
1,make it easy for me...,"I didn't actually read this, I'm just being mean because I hate authors who put pictures of themselves on the covers of their books. Gives me the impression that they are actually a greasy salesman and the book is nothing but a comeone for some seminar or website or anything else that can suck money out of you. The red power tie and the made easy title only reinforce that assumption and then I get extra cynical when the guy has funny name on top of it. I know you shouldn't judge a book by it's cover, but let's face it...the guy looks like a Dick."
2,Disappointing FX book,"There's a real dearth of good investment books focussing on the FX market, and unfortunately this book does very little to fill that void. Instead of ""Forex made Easy,"" I would love to read a book called ""Forex made Profitable,"" which is definitely not this book. His technical analysis section is pretty much a wash-out. Do not buy this book."
1,junk,"Go ask a professional trader what they think about his book and software and enjoy the laughter. A simple search will find out LOTS of info about these supposed traders and the ""magic"" software. Trading takes alot of time, knowledge, and ability to absorb losses."
1,Terrible!,I made the mistake of buying this book because it was the only FOREX book at my local bookstore. BIG MISTAKE!This is nothing but a sales pitch for the author's online products. The FOREX info the author does provide is scant and incomplete.Do yourself a favor and buy any other book on the market if you really want to learn about foreign currency exchange.
1,A Gimmick,"This book is completely devoid of any substance. I expected to learn about the FX market, through laymens terms and easy-to-follow examples.It turns out that this book is simply an advertisement for the author's software product; it even turns into a manual in Chapter 13!I have never written a review before, but I was too annoyed to be reticent. Hopefully this will prevent others from wasting their time and money. If you must see it for yourself, please make sure you don't lose the receipt."
3,Forex Made Easy,"I'm new to the Forex market and I was looking for somethingthat would give me some basic understanding of this market.After reading this book, I still feel like the basics of Forexwere not explained."
3,Intermediate trader,"Found much of the info to be redundant IF you have done the 4x course and cd course. Much of the info can be obtained online free of charge. I expected more, but maybe for a total newbie it may be useful."
1,James Dicks is a scam! Waiting for the class action lawsuit to begin,"I got this book when I purchased the 3k software (still mad at myself for being suckered into buying it) and the book is more like a bunch of magazine articles haphazardly put together than a how-to book. I had to keep doing further readings on other websites to understand concepts that this book does not explain well. The Forex is NOT Made Easy by Dicks. I call him a scam and a fraud because I lost thousands by following his ""Forex Alerts"" after I had lost thousands trying on my own. I tracked his ""Forex Alerts"" (had to pay $300 a month for them)on a excel spreadsheet and there was no way anyone could be profitable by following his advice and that of his band of ""experts"". His website premieretradeai.com and his customer service number do not exist anymore; what does that tell me? He's a fraud!"
1,Not worth it,"This book suggests that people like me trade FOREX because the banks do it, like Bank of America, Lehman Brothers, and Citigroup.What's THAT about?"
1,Does NOT remotely resemble the title,"There is so little written about trading the Forex, I was exited about ordering this book. It is A HUGE disappointment. Very few pages are devoted to Forex. There is no Forex information you can't find free on Xpresstrade or probably most any other website. The whole book is a poorly arranged conglomeration of elementary technical and fundamental analysis techniques pertaining to stocks and futures, charting, indicators, etc. And he pushes his own Forex software.If you want Forex info, don't even consider buying this book."
2,Don't waste your money...,This is not a book. It's just a promotional piece for Mr. Dicks website and broker services. Every other page mentions his website. The information he gives you could be easily found on the internet it is so general...just filler. Lot's of full page graphs to fill up this thin book. It probably took him a weekend to write the book. His website looks like a high school kid designed it. I read the whole book in 1hr.
2,Sales Pitch For Author's FOREX Service,"This book claims to be a FOREX FOR DUMMIES type book. It is in fact a complicated sales pitch for the author's FOREX software service which costs thousands of $$. Beware of this author's infomercial, it is a throwback to the no money down Real Estate and Mail Order scams of the 80's."
2,skip this book,"There is essentially no topic in this book presented with enough quality information to allow the reader to make any consistent profit from FOREX trading. If you picked the book up in a bookstore and wrote a list of the topics on a piece of paper, you would have a place to start your search. In other words, don't waste your money. The only reason I did not ""hate the book"" is because the information is essentially accurate. But trading FOREX successfully (actually any successful trading) is difficult. In this market you are trading with or against enormously deep pockets who know more than you.If you want some alternative ideas, consider these three:1. Currency Trading; Philip Gotthelf; Wiley; 20032. Day Trading the Currency Market; Kathy Lien; Wiley; 20063. Trade Your Way to Financial Freedom-second edition; Van K Tharp; McGraw-Hill; 2007."
1,Reviews are as misleading as this Crappy book.,"I only feel it fair to note that all of the positive reviews listed on this horrendous book are not only disguised by withholding the real name features but are also names of premieretrade employees that I became familiar with by reading yet another garbage newsletter from this company promoting their products and services. Wouldn't surprise me if the basis of this book was stolen and re-written by a child as it certainly seems like was done. I have had terrible experiences with this company and im no smarter than the publisher of this book as Mr. Dicks has 3000 of my dollars, which his company refused to return.If you have a lot of money and time to waste you are in the right place. Don't be conned by these guys as I was."
1,Stay Away,"This book is a total waste of money, like any other scam that this guy and his company puts out. Stay away unless you enjoy falling into yet another get rich quick scam."
5,FOREX,"I think that James' book on the foreign currency market is exactly what I have been looking for. 6 Ways To Trade The Dollar has taught me the importance of this market and most importantly how to make the most of my money. Reading this book showed me I'm able to trade this market with great leverage that I was unaware of prior to reading this guide. If you are anything like me and are looking for a way in to a largely profitable market, check out this book."
2,"Google ""Forex Trading"" Before Purchasing","The book is an okay book for someone who is brand new to the foreign exchange market. Unfortnately, most, if not all the content is available for free on the Web. If you're not familiar with using search engines, buy the book."
1,AFULL!!!!!!! MIGHT HAVE RUINED PRINTER...DONT KNOW TILL I GET NEW INK!!!,"Ya they send directions,and we followed it to the The chip you take off the orginal will NOT stay on,and Yes we did it Just like they showed.The chip feel off inside my printer,ink may have leeked inside aswell, chouldnt find the chip inside my printer,ink was a mess,Was a compleate waste of money and time,Plus,Now I need to get differant ink with the chip already on it,And then i'll know if my printer still works,This was a huge mistake to buy this!!"
5,Beautiful,"This is the best produced performance of D929 that I have heard, very beautiful. The sound is very nice. The only problem here is the andante con moto, which is too prudently played; if it is not too slow, it feels so; the con moto is missed.For more excitement I would go for the Stern trio, and contrary to some others, I like the Stuttgart trio on the Schubert-trios, which has a correctly marching andante. For Les Musiciens on D. 898 (op. 99), search amazon: B00004TVGB."
3,There are far better recordings,"This is one of those peices that is hard for people to agree on how everything should be play and at what tempo, etc. I personally have several recordings of this, and this is my least favorite. The Adagio is too slow, and there are huge problems in the Finale when the violin and piano trade off. Basically, I am not telling you you won't like it, but given the price, it would be better to try another one first.Btw, the Adagio of this peice was used in the movie Barry Lydon, a Stanley Krubrick movie. If you want a version that sounds like it was played in that movie, this one is not it."
2,Not what I expected.,"This tool is poorly designed. It takes two hands to operate it as it is intended. And still, you will pinch your hands/fingers more often than not when the clamp slips off the weight. I had to re-tool the clamp tongs to help them grasp the weights at all. It's awkward to hammer weights b/c the handles don't close together.Overall disappointment. The cost was low so I'll try to reshape the handles to help with the tool's usefulness.Would not recommend these unless you are able to fashion them to suit your needs."
2,This book is not for programmer,This book doesn't contain any information for the developer who has to get into the problem quickly. And there is no sign that deep exploration of it will give more useful information. This book is for a complete dummy but I can't see how reading it will help him.
2,Not-a-Great Review,"The first 60 pages of this book are all that's really worthwhile. Although the author is given to some overly dramatic hyperbole and lists all the terrible things that will happen if you're not using EDI, the first 60 pages contain a few helpful hints.The rest of the book is a[n]...advertisement for Trading Partner Desktop by Mercator Systems. If this is the software you're using, the book may be worth buying. Otherwise, find another book."
2,one song,"this is a case where i got a album that only had one good song on it, the title song is what i wanted and thats all i got the rest were awfull,but that was the chance i took,i wanted that one song on a c.d format."
1,Disappointing offering from a usually trusted source,"Don't get me wrong: I love Atkins and I'm a low carber myself. But I don't know what they were thinking when they put this cookbook together. Oh wait, I do know: they were thinking that total carb count is all that matters. Anyone who really understands low carb knows that it isn't just the total number of carbs you consume: where those carbs come from matters at least as much. So I was surprised to see recipes in this book calling for ingredients most low carbers wouldn't dream of touching on a regular basis. There also seemed to be an over-reliance on Atkins products, and overall, it looked too much like someone took a regular cookbook and just substituted artificial sweeteners for sugar and Atkins bake mix for flour and thought the recipes would fly. Not only did I make the decision not to buy this book, I didn't even like it enough to check it out of the library after reading through it. I hope the next Atkins book is closer to the mark."
3,A Wonderful Source for a Beneficial Lifestyle,"It's too bad and unfortunate that Dr. Atkins has passed. With his widow compiling and publishing this cookbook, it keeps his memory and his beneficial lifestyle alive. The book is informative, easy to read and easy to navigate."
3,So-so,"The format leaves a lot to be desired. Recipes are basically the same as the previous cookbook, so if you have the older one, don't waste your money on this one."
1,Does not deserve even one star!,"I was flabbergasted in looking through these recipes. Has Veronica Atkins gone crazy or become ""carb-liberated"" since her husband died? These recipes are a disaster for the low-carb dieter or for diabetics. There is even one recipe that calls for a teaspoon of sugar! How disappointing. I took mine right back to the store.After all the work and sacrifice of Dr. Atkins and all the good he has done for seriously ill people, it is criminal to put the Atkins name on a book like this. It is dishonest and misleading. Veronica Atkins, you should be ashamed of yourself, to compromise like this!"
4,South Africa Homecoming,"Again, I can only write praises and graditude to the Gaithers and friends. I feel blessed to have so much of their music. God is leading their way and they are so obedient to His call."
4,Pretty Good,"I thought this was pretty funny. Others dont really like the movie and I dont know why. He was in character for the entire length of the film/show. I am sure he was a little tipsy, but he pulled it off."
2,Disjoint Rambling,"This seemed to have the potential to be an interesting performance piece, but it just didn't come together. It was a disjoint and rambling hour with no overarching point or theme to pull it together."
1,people laugh at this?,"Really, this is funny?What is the part which is funny? Was it the camping part or the part where he is getting towed on the beach? The standup?"
2,"This went horribly wrong, too bad","I normally love Zach Galifianakis and am a fan. This one, no, not so much. He is obsessed with the camera and if he said ""my DVD"" one more time I was going to turn it off. He spent a third of the video picking on one poor old guy which was amusing for a few minutes but became painful. He spends a third of the time looking at the camera flashing goofy looks for his ""DVD"" or talking about the name of the DVD. That only left the last third for comedy. Too bad, it is obvious they cut out a lot of scenes and it doesn't flow well and not his best stuff."
2,Funny Moments Too Far and In Between,"I wonder if Zach viewed the final cut of this DVD. Did he not see that what funny moments there were could have been edited down to around 15-20 minutes? The rest is filled with drunken, awkward pockets of nothing. I expected more from this clever comedian."
2,Not worth it,"It shouldn't be called ""Live at the Purple Onion"" but more ""Semi-Live at the Purple Onion but More Fake Interviews with my 'Brother.'"" There's barely any stand-up in it. I love his comedy, he's one of my favourites, but this DVD isn't worth it."
2,Not his best stuff,"I saw Zack Galifianakis on Comedy Central Presents and I thought he was hilarious. He was also good in the movie ""Out Cold."" So I expected this DVD to be really funny. However, this material was no where near as good as the stuff from his half-hour Comedy Central special. I think he may have been drunk during this routine."
1,Badly Political,"It was marginally OK until near the end where it became inexplicably, awkwardly, and inappropriately political. Why alienate half your audience?"
1,I See Rehab in Zach's Future,"I really think Zach G is a rare comedic talent, but this is not his finest moment. Some may say this is just part of his act, but he was clearly hungover, and very out of it during this performance. To watch him down like 10 beers during the show on top of whatever else he was on was painful to watch. I just watched his two SNL shows again last week, and he is so sharp and funny there, but borderline incoherent during this ""performance."" Some may find this kind of self-destrucive behavior amusing, but I think it's very, very sad."
5,Brilliant,Zach is the best comedian in the game today. His awkward style of delivery is a thing of beauty.
1,Normally I really like this guy...,"I've really enjoyed his movies (especially the recent ones) and the stand-up I've seen on TV.But he was really obnoxious in this video... I didn't even watch the last ten minutes because I wasn't laughing at all. He picked on one guy in the audience really hard the entire time who obviously didn't take it very well, and insulted the audience repeatedly to the point of being awkward. And to be honest, even aside from that, his speech delivery was off and the jokes just weren't very funny. Maybe the pressure is getting to him? I just never had such a bad impression of him before, but this performance has almost completely ruined any draw I had to him and his work. Not at all like what I've seen of him previously.Buy/rent The Hangover or Visioneers instead."
4,Much better than I expected.,I am not a huge fan of Zach's but this dvd of him doing stand up left me hurting from laughing so hard. He is so much more funny when he is not scripted like in movies.
2,Zach live,Great comedian but not worth purchasing. There are only a few minutes of greatness and the rest is dull. I would have liked to see him doing the entire standup performance instead of weaving an alter ego interview. Rent on Netflix first before committing to purchase.
2,Tedious.,"The audience must've had a long while to get liquored up, because they laugh at anything...which includes nothing...which describes what Zach is doing on stage for at least half of this performance. The one bit that I did like is the interview with Seth - good stuff there, but not enough to sustain watching this 1 hour and 1 minute time suck. Sorry, Zach, I know you're funnier than this. Do better next time."
5,Hilarious!,"Hands down, hilarious! His delivery is on point and you never know what he's going to say. I love the music factor also."
3,Not as good as other shows!,"I have been a fan of Zach Galifianakis for a long time. Zach is one of my favorite comedians, and every other special of his I have seen I always have laughed uncontrolably. But with this DVD there were some really funny parts, but the rest of the DVD is not very funny at all. I would recomend that you save your money and not by this DVD, the laughs you get are not worth the money spent."
1,Didn't even finish watching it,"I have a very broad taste in movies and comedy. There are very few movies or stand up comedy specials that I won't like. The fact that I couldn't even finish the DVD should tell you what I thought about it. He cracked a few jokes in the beginning which got my hopes up but over the 40 minutes that I could bare to watch they ended up being the only 2 jokes that I laughed at. For the majority of the time he is just talking to the crowd and not being very funny about it in my opinion. The rest of the time, they show pre-recorded skits where he is pretending to be his twin brother or with his group of friends and I felt that both of those were pointless and even more dull than his stand-up portion. I found him to be very disappointing and boring. Overall I can say that I wasted my money on this DVD."
2,Not funny.,"This is such a weird performance. Its pretty terrible and mostly not funny. Hes really rude to one guy in the audience and not in a hilarious way like you can find in his BTWN 2 FRNS. BTWN 2 FERNS is actually HYSTERICAL and this is bad - hes not a good standup comedian judging from this. I saw him on SNL doing some standup which was actually really funny. this leads me to believe that he was too nervous or just didnt take this performance seriously at all. i was disappointed. he is however one of my favorite tv personalities and if you wanna check this out because youre a ZACH G fan then by all means see it, but i dont think this will be one of your favorite works by him."
2,Zach Galifianakis - Live at the Purple Onion,"It feels like he got the money upfront and just phoned it in, not his best by far. Since I sometimes perform at the Purple Condiment, thanks Zach, this makes me feel better about my lame material."
2,Just Ok,"This video was hard to follow, there were some funny moments, but nowhere near as funny as I thought it would be. I bought this as a gift for my husband, and he thought the same. The video was strange b/c it jumps all over the place in terms of sequence. Zach in the hangover is ten times funnier."
2,THIS VIDEO IS AS FUNNY AS BEIRUT...,DON'T GO PLAY IT THERE AMAZON. THEY WON'T FIND IT FUNNY EITHER. PRODUCED BY NETFLIX...WHY? BECAUSE EVERYONE KNOWS NETFLIX WILL PRODUCE ANYTHING! (WHICH IS GREAT BECAUSE I'M SURE TO MAKE MONEY OFF THE TAPING OF MY HERNIA OPERATION)I DON'T KNOW MAYBE IT'S ALL THAT DRUG BUILD UP IN THIS GENERATION BRAINS THAT HAVE LEFT THEM STUPID FOOLS THAT WILL LAUGH AT ANYTHING. ALTHOUGH ZACKY IS MAKING LOTS OF MONEY NOWADAYS (GO FOR IT) AND HE IS EASY ON THE BEAR LOVERS EYES. THIS VIDEO WAS A SHOT IN THE DARK THAT COULDN'T EVEN HIT THE SIDE OF A HORNY BEARS FAT ASS!
5,Totally worth watching again and again!,This Zach Galifianakis DVD is one of my all time Comedy favorites! The first time I watched it I had to pause the DVD every 5 minutes to catch my breath 'cause I laughed so hard! I've watched it so many times since - and it still has me laughing! He is so brilliant... there's no one like him for timing and delivery... and his acting is superb... just check out the interviews with his brother Seth! I've bought this DVD for gifts and everyone I've given it to adores him now... You can't go wrong... Zach will never let you down!
4,Definitely different,"Not a favorite of mine, but it is not leaving my collection. This is actually a pleasant collection and the performances are pleasing. However, it requires the listener, IMO, to actually take the time to listen to the CD. Take the time to pay attention to what is going on and do read the notes. There are subtle sounds in the background that set the stage and add to the experience... you won't 'get it' as commuting muzak. This demands listeners' attention."
4,Cannonball Quintet,"Cannonball, Nat, Joe Zawinul, Sam Jones, Louis Hayes - Arriving Soon 8 min. Unit Seven 9 min. Scotch and Water 5 min. Hosted as usual By Ralph Gleason. October 1961"
5,Da Green (War) Machine,"That's right, everybody's favorite green horde is back and meaner than ever. Although a bit smaller than the previous rulez, this Ork Codex gives you background stories to get you into ""Da Ork Mentality"" as well as general strategy on how to field and command your Ork Horde. Excellent race for any beginner or veteran as it has a fairly intuitive basic strategy, yet complex multi-part battle plans that you can devise on your own. The Orks remind me a lot of Magic the Gathering. You can play just creatures and overrun your enemies. Or you can play a mind game where he expects creatures any moment, yet you wittle him down with surgical precision. And remember, all vehicles go faster if they're painted RED. Da Orks are ma boyz!"
4,My guilty pleasure,"Although ""Ladyhawke"" is my favorite film from the 1980's sword-and-sorcery genre, the soundtrack, an uneasy hybrid of rock and traditional scoring, is the movie's weakest element. Yet, taken on its own merits, this CD has become one of my favorite ""guilty pleasures."" True, the rock elements are badly dated, and the orchestral writing, while it does has some inventive moments, is not top-drawer. But there's a goofy, earnest quality about it all that makes it perfect listening for those moments when this music major wants to shut his brain down for a while and avoid thinking about things, especially music, seriously. Don't get this CD if you're looking for great art-get it for entertainment value. (Of course, it helps if you have a weakness for 80's music.)"
4,Great sounding soundtrack,"This is one of those love it or leave it soundtracks. In my case, I love it. Of course, a love for the movie LADYHAWKE helps as well. The main title is especially wonderful. This is a good soundtrack to listen to while surfing the net."
2,Pure 1980s pop pablum...,"I dont know what people find so quaint about this music-i dont mind a modern score on an ancient movie-but this sounds like 80s big hair elevator music, like you would hear on an episode of tv's LOVE BOATs in-house Lounge band-so unsophisticated, so cliched, so......pointless.I hope that somewhere is buried an actual pure symphonic score for this magical movie, as perhaps a dual soundtracked DVD SE could give all folks their desired version..."
1,Gee.... Is that a soundtrack???,"Who's that guy, Andrew Powell? When I watched the film on TV I didn't even pay attention to the score, though I collect soundtracks. I bought the CD, however, because I was curious, but... I really got disappointed. There's no one single theme to support the score. I can't believe Richard Donner - who signed the film ""The Omen"", whichwas scored by the REAL composer Jerry Goldsmith - has written all those kind words about Mr. Powell, a poor talented musician. For those who appreciate this ""soundtrack"" I only can say that they don't know the art of scoring movies; they just wanna dance..."
1,avoid this one like the plague,"this cd is purely for alan parsons freaks to say they have a complete collection of his works. the music is typical parsons, but it gets boring after hearing the same stuff for 30 minutes - the film action with it might be brilliant but this is definitely a collector's album - my suggestion is to buy anything else by alan parsons because they are good - this one is only good for the rubbish bin - an appalling waste of time and money even for an alan parsons fan"
5,LadyHawke Revisited,"I agree with one of the other reviewers, LadyHawke has always been one of my all-time favorites and one of the only things I could ever criticize about the film was it's strange soundtrack. However after purchasing it and playing it through I've actually come to enjoy it very much. My favorite tracks would have to be the more traditional orchestral pieces such as the Main Title, one that truly stands out is the beautiful No. 7 track, ""Phillippe Describes Isabeau"" and the following Gregorian chants in track 8 ""Bishop's Procession"". Another track that is more in keeping with the time period is the medieval sounding track 9, ""Wedding Music"" but those are just my personal faves. There are several other tracks that are dramatic and suspenseful and even the modern rock mixed tracks are catchy outside the film. Overall an enjoyable and entertaining soundtrack but still feel that during the film some of the modern rock music is jarringly out of place in this beautiful timeless tale."
5,Shoes that make anyone want to run!,"I will start by saying, I am not a runner, and bought these before going off to school. They were surprisingly comfy, and also very light; perhaps the lightest shoes I have owned. Although not a runner, I am a soccer player, and had to take off for a two mile run one of the first days I owned them. The sneakers, although not broken in, were perfect for the run, and left my feet in tact.I do not like to run, but these shoes make the uncomfortable task tolerable. I run twice a week, and just today ran three miles in these shoes. They are perfect for running or even just walking."
5,Just beautiful music,I have been a big fan of Emile Pandolfi for many years now. His cd's make for excellent background music for romantic dinners or Sunday morning with the newspaper and coffee.
2,"Very Advanced, No Modifications Shown","There are many advanced poses such as splits, etc, no modifications. This is an advanced workout, especially the 2nd one which I previewed and didn't attempt. The 1st workout is okay; I didn't do the splits and I modified a couple of other poses on my own."
3,Fast Paced,"I am not a professional yoga person or a beginner for that matter. I tried different styles and bought this thinking I could do some yoga at home. And granted I just tried it once and I am not the best at coordination or paying attention... however they go way too fast. Yes you get a workout, but not a relaxing one that incorporates enough breathing focus. They whip through it. Eventually I will able to keep up. However I did like the 5 minutes of restorative on the dvd in the bonus section."
1,Experience Yogis Only,"I was really excited to begin a Yoga workout. I need to work on strength and flexibility, and thought this video would be a good start. I turned the video on, so excited to begin the workout. Well, it moved so fast, and they were doing moves I only hope that someday I will be able to do. Full splits in the first minute. I was a bit upset, and feel I wasted my money. Maybe someday when I am more experienced with Yoga I will be able to come back to this DVD."
1,Horrible yoga,"This dvd is extremely challenging and for the advanced yoga people. For one the instructor is extremely annoying and she goes too fast. The most important thing about yoga is making sure your body is in the right position, and have your posture right, its all about feeling your body, and this dvd does not give you any of that. I do not recommend this to anybody, especially beginners. I disliked the instructor as well."
2,Instructions are poor and voice drones on.,The Likes:-- Length - 20 or so minutes.-- DVD Format - get to your program quickly-- Nice clear photographyThe Dislikes:-- The instructor is not doing the exercises. I think its better when they are.-- Instructions are poor. She drones on. Just an unpleasant voice to me.-- The ladies doing the exercises are clearly models.-- The instructor's voice rips thru the moves and its hard to follow.I'll come back to this DVD a little later.
3,What is it?,"Thanks for the e-mail advertising the product, now can anybody tell me what in the heck this 3-disk set DVD has on it?"
5,BOOK IS EXCELLENT COMPANION ON THOSE LONG LONELY CALL NIGHTS,BOOK IS A GREAT COMPANION ON THOSE CALL NIGHTS WHEN YOU ARE FORCED TO FUNCTION ON YOUR OWN AND THE WORLD SEEMS TO BE ON YOUR SHOULDERS. THE BOOK HELPS YOU MAKE LIFE SAVING DECISIONS!!
5,Fascinating,"There are fascinating random factoids on nearly every page. My coworkers and most friends don't care to hear all my new knowledge, unfortunately. Not exactly cocktail party chitchat. But extremely interesting to learn about. Mating habits, nervous systems, favorite foods, pheromones,molting, it's all here!"
4,will interest a wide range of readers,"This book should interest a wide range of readers, thanks to Schweid's style. He presents the science clearly and concisely, enlivening it with interesting digressions, often of a personal nature. Schweid is no scientist, but this is rarely a problem. He does understate the role of bacteria in the cockroach's ability to digest foods like glue and cloth. Since ruminants rely on bacteria to digest grass, I have to believe the cockroach uses bacteria for more than making vitamins. While the book was published in 1999, and research on asthma is ongoing, a brief check of the web confirms the cockroach-asthma link."
4,Wonderful horse story for kids,"I read and re-read this book as a child. Granted, not as often as the Black Stallion series, but often enough to have the trilogy nearly memorized. If your kids love horses, I recommend the tale of Joey and Fury"
5,Good non-cutesy unicorns,"Both of my daughters enjoyed this series. I read it aloud to my younger daughter, who often doesn't have the patience for anything longer than a picture book. And her sister, who was in 7th or 8th grade at the time and reads voraciously, borrowed the set and scarfed them down in an afternoon. So they might be a good fit for middle school reluctant readers, since they have a pretty easy reading level but are capable of holding the interest of an older girl.But I agree with the other reviewer who said the book doesn't really stand alone. Plan on continuing into the rest of the series."
3,"O.K. sequel to ""The Mysterious Mr. Sabin""","This book is readable and interesting, but not as good, IMO, as the first Mr. Sabin book. There are only 2, afaik.SPOILERS (if you haven't read the other book)Mr Sabin is called out of blissful retirement to search for his missing wife, Lucille, Countess of Something or Other. It turns out she is somehow wrapped up with a pan-national Royalist secret society of frightening power and influence, much like the Nihilists who put an end to Mr. Sabin's plans in the last book. Why these Royalists didn't show up to protect him from the Nihilists is never discussed.Like I said, readable and interesting to watch Mr. Sabin control himself and walk with such dignity and aristocratic bearing and tact, even as he plots to save his own life and reunite with his beloved Lucille. The ending is beyond belief, tho, and left me chortling with derision."
3,Context is everything,"A nice crafted defense of the rights of the aristocracy to rule the ""unwashed"" masses crept up on me before I realized it. Though torn, I was hooked and wanted to know the fates of the characters. I read this because it is free, Oppenheim is a writer whose style intrigues me, and he typically spins a good yarn. Of course, reading older books exposes one to older sensibilities, somewhat jarring to a modern reader. Something of a departure from his luxurious mysteries, though akin in so many ways.The Yellow Crayon"
5,It's the BEST mafia book I have ever read!!,"This is an amazing, mind blowing book that will never get old! It is a book that you wont be able to put down from the second you read it, and the ending will blow your mind!! Greg Healey is an amazing author and i hope to see a lot more from him!!! I truly am his #1 fan!!"
3,Fan from Minneapolis,"I am from the groups' hometown of Minneapolis and was very into their music in the late 80's. Great songs like ""Victory Line"", ""Never Enough"" & ""This Is Serious"" remind me of summer. I honestly cannot recall the rest of the tracks, but remember enjoying the entire cassette at the time, and remember it being a really fun 80's dance LP. I also went to college with one of the band members' brothers in Northern Minnesota. Very cool."
4,So Far So Good !,"We just bought the HP psc500 and we are very impressed so far. The color originals are crisp and lifelike and the color copies are hard to tell from the originals. Have not used all it's various features yet, but I will report back when we do."
1,Don't buy the PSC500,We have now gone through 2 of these machines. There is a communication problem with the scanner that can't be resolved no matter how many phone calls were made to tech support. It's not worth the headache it will give you.
2,Terrific Printer,"I am on my second psc500, and only because my first one was damaged by a liquid spill after using it for about 4 years. I bought a used one off of ebay to replace it as I could no longer find a new one. paid $65 for it, plus shipping, and now its been about 7 years since it was purchased. I wouldn't trade it for a new current model. I own several other hp's, including 2 psc 750s. I like them, but still prefer the psc 500. If others have had problems, it was probably a problem with their own machines compatibility. I work on computers for a living, and have seen very few problems with this particular machine. If you can still find one, don't hesitate to buy it."
2,Good While It Worked,"Like another customer commented, this machine did an okay job while it worked, but after about nine months of light usage, it died. The first thing to go out was the trigger that turns the shredder on when paper is first inserted. That broke about three months after we got it. There's sort of a manual over-ride switch on it, though, so you could keep it on if you were going to shred a lot of documents. We would have to use this switch to turn it on to shred even one document after the trigger broke. I would see about having it fixed, but it was really loud when it was working, anyway, so I think we're going to spend more money next time to get a better model. I have to admit that it was pretty quick, though, and it didn't have a problem cutting through two or three pages at a time."
4,Characters come alive in this tale of desperation!,"Alexis Harrington has a way with getting us inside her characters' heads and showing us their emotions. This is a terrific book, which I recommend highly. Her characters are multi-dimentional, real, honest and human. Lexie & I belong to the same chapter of Romance Writers of America, and she autographed a copy for me, which I will treasure. She tells me that the sub-plot is a chapter right out of Oregon history. This is a sweet, sexy, full-of-anguish story, and it gets my vote for RWA's Favorite book of the Year! If you love the old west, you must read this book"
3,Kindle killed it,"The story is strong, moving and beautifully written. It's an improbable (to start) love story between bounty hunter Jace Rankin and ranch owner Kyla Springer Bailey. Kyla has lost posession of her ranch, and her innocence, to her step brother Tom Hardesty. He has a thing for brutal rape as is demonstrated more than once in the book. He is a member of the corrupt Vigilance Union.Kyla travels to find help disguised as Kyle, a snot nosed teenage boy with less than no manners. The constant changes from Kyla to Kyle are well written and realistic, as is her use of the Kyle persona whenever she feels threatened.The love scenes are touchingly real. The adventure and danger are thrilling.My problem was that I bought the book on Kindle. It was soooo badly transcribed to kindle format that it was hard to follow. At one point Jace was kissing Kyle instead of Kyla! Give me a break! Buy the book. Don't buy it on Kindle until they fix the mess the publisher made of it."
4,Defintiely worth the time....,"I've read and reread this book...while the plot moves in a somewhat predictable direction, there are surprising detours along the way. Kyla pretends to be a boy, Kyle, to convince Jace, the legendary and feared bounty hunter, to kill the man that stole her virtue and home. The reader can easily get into the plot and the story moves along at a quick pace. There is the typical amount of ""I'm not what you need"" and ""I'm no good for you"", but it's not too overdone. Jace is rather well versed in how to cherish a young woman who has been brutalized, which of course conflicts with the touch guy image, but wouldn't it be boring otherwise? He's a great hero.I've read several Alexis Harrington books, and this is the best one so far. It's a great way to spend a few hours. Enjoy!"
1,Not at all useful.,"Having seen Matt Woolman's ""Moving Type"", which is a great resource, I had hoped for similar and updated content in covering this design area. This is a very disappointing book as it seems it is a compendium of advertising for the motion design houses out there with very little to offer aside from screenshots of various projects. You are better off just visiting the websites of the companies covered for free with the added benefit of seeing QuickTimes of the TYPE IN MOTION."
2,Ok if for free,"I saw the first Type in Motion book, and it looked pretty interesting, so I bought the Type in Motion 2 because I thought all this cool stuff has happened between the first and second book. Well, the examples aren't that exciting and the layout of the book doesn't make them more so. If you're looking for inspiration, you won't find it here."
4,"A well-written, imaginative, and original novel.","Here is a young writer with an enviable imagination. The post-mortem character of Dean is a peculiar and wonderful creation, and it's a fun though sometimes exasperating ride finding out what happens to him. I'm eager to see what Leebron comes up with next."
2,It's a book.,"While occasionally interesting, Out West suffers greatly from the fact that it never generates any real feelings or compassion/distaste towards the protagonists, by either the narrator or reader. Their relationship seems TV drama-stilted at best, and since story revolves exclusively around them, Leebron never builds momentum for what could have a been a semi-appealing story."
1,Trite and not well thought through.,"Although the book contained a certain element of suspense at the begining, the all-too-familiar flashbacks take away some of the flavor. Most of the flashbacks have nothing to do with the story at all and tend to lead the reader astray. The reader does not care about the two protagonists because there is never really a connection between them. All the scenes were briefly mentioned and its hard to tell where the characters are. None of the major cities mentioned in the book are described in great detail. Normally this would be satisfactory but the characters describe the effect their environment has on them. What environment??? Furthermore, some of the scenes are awkward and could have been omitted. The book was reminicent of 'Double Indemnity' except not well thought through. To sum it up, the story was not well thought through and therefore everything else (i.e. style, dialog, etc.) could not work."
1,"A poorly written, poorly conceived novel.","One-dimensional characters. A flimsy plot that lacks the shading of true noir. Writing that is both trite and dull. While Mr. Leebron seems to have some skill, I'm afraid his writing is so mannered that even the most interesting premises fall flat."
4,"Drill me another, please!","Wow, who could have thought that something as simple and cute as this game is sooooo addictive. You must drill down, trying to escape falling blocks as they fall 'Tetris' style whilst trying to keep your oxygen levels up at the same time. The graphics are great for this simple game, the background music enhances the fun. Does get harder the deeper you dig. RECOMMENDED FOR ALL AGES!"
5,Easy to learn - addictive gameplay,"A very simple game with very easy controls yet addictive. There are several different gameplays (timed, arcade, survival) and each with their own goals. You basically attempt to take Mr. Driller down as many levels as you can in the meantime avoiding falling blocks and picking up air capsuls. There isn't a whole lot of strategy involved although as you move along you learn how the blocks react to your actions. Except for the Timed mode - its not about speed but strategy - of course I spent most of my time just moving as quickly as I could and laughing at the consequences.Non-violent, fun game for kid's and adults alike."
1,Mr. Driller has no positive aspect whatsoever,"I'll put it simple, it's the worst game on the face of the earth.It's also a waste of money."
3,Important But Narrowly Directed,"Frawley has taken on a very important task, trying to reconcile and unify cognitive science with a more sociocultural understanding of mind. I am very interested in this topic, so I was disappointed that I didn't get more out of the book than I did, even though I came to it with a doctorate in sociology and considerable background in science and philosophy. Ideally the book should have appealed to educated readers in many disciplines, but Frawley assumes a great deal of prior study in the philosophy of mind. Few without that specific background will be able to appreciate and evaluate his argument. Even within that field, some will probably be put off by his computationist position: ""Consciousness emerges out of the purely computational manipulations of nonconscious processes."" The project may be the ""unification of the social and computational mind,"" but in the end, computation embraces all."
5,The age of Elegance,"Is a beautiful book , I think it's .a great book about images and content, it's size is perfect to take anywhere."
1,questionable security,"Plastic construction will provide questionable security. Hopefully will be sufficient for my small midwestern town. Expected steel construction. Also, mounting screws do not provide solid attachment, box could be easily pried from mounting post. Bought some large washers to improve the strength. Would not recommend where strong security is required."
3,Mailguard security mailbox,"Ordered our second mailbox (we loved the first one) and have had problems with the flag. The information to reach the company was on the info sheet in the box. The company has not responded to phone message, email inquiry or snail mail letter. We finally did some adapting on our own. The overall quality/workmanship not like the first mailbox."
2,Illusion of Safety,"The bolt seems adequate to me, the problem is the hinge mechanism is a joke; I had to pop it into place by hand. A thief could pop this open in 1/2 second. Ironically, the mail compartment is hard to open normally, I will probably need a pry bar just to get my mail. They also only provided 3 out of 4 mounting screws. The flag mounting design is also poor, although I wont ever use it so I don't care.Update: while attempting to sand down the door so that it would be openable, it fell onto the floor. The top mail slot broke off, and is now unusable; the bottom (""secure"") mail door popped off its hinges. This thing is worthless."
1,The worst customer service ever !!!!,"I purchased this product, hung it up ,then realized the lid didnt close therefor all my mail got wet!! I also had a difficult time using the lock! This mail box is very big so make sure you check out the measurements before you buy it. The worst of it is, I called mailguard three times, left messages and didn't get a phone call back!!! When I emailed them they denied I called them at all!!! You gotta love it when you make a purchase, ask for help from the manufactor and they lie to you saying you never called them!!!! Unbelieveable !!!! How silly and unprofessional of a response from there customer service. Need I say I returned this item."
1,Security Mail box is junk!,"The top door is very hard to open. It is so had to open that the screws that secure it to the 4x4 post will pull out of the plastic back of the mail box in no time at all. The entire top of the box flexes when the door is being opened. The locking mechanism doesn't work either. The key can be inserted and turned, but when it is locked, the key can't be removed. Not much good this way. Save your money and buy something better."
3,"Huge & Ugly, but Practical & Good Quality (for plastic )","Be very careful when you order this and ask for the dimensions which are NOT given ... Don't just order it ... then find out that it would take up the entire front wall ... and ""stick out like a sore thumb""! For the average home user, it will hold all your family mail for a month.ADDED REVIEW NOTE: Amazon.com has finally decided to add the dimensions in the description so you are warned!"
3,Mailguard mailbox,"The overall design of this mailbox is appealing, and the box is serving us fairly well. The main advantage has been having a locked storage vault at a reasonable price, but we have had some problems. First, the drop slot through which the mail deliverer inserts the mail is too narrow. We occasionally receive items that are too thick to go through the slot. Second, the door to the mailbox slants upward and has a tendency simply to fall open. As a result, outgoing mail sometimes is exposed to passersby and to the elements. Also when the door falls open, the mail slot is exposed and, if it rains, water may enter the vault through the exposed mail slot. I tried several ""fixes"" for this problem that didn't work but, after several tries, I did find one that has worked. I placed an ordinary thumb tack in the top of the door so that when the door is closed it fits more tightly than before. The plastic material is soft enough to permit you to do this with only a light tap with a hammer."
2,Wet Mail,This mailbox leaks so you have wet mail if it has rained or if it rains while the mail is in the box. Melting snow also presents a probem. JS in AZ
4,"I am pleased with overall design, but...","The unusual shape attracts attention, but it is the reason the mail is secure. This is a very low maintenance product and easy to install. I beat on it with a baseball bat (not toooo hard) and no damage or even marks are evident. It is approved by the ""Post Master General"".The construction is not on par with the design. I purchased two units. One worked perfectly and the other has (had) problems with the mail door staying closed. The design relies on the interference of the door lip and the top of the hole it fits in to. Too much of the plastic was ground off during manufactering and the door tended to flop open. Using pliers I was able to crimp a portion of the plastic at the top of the door causing a firmer fit and now the door stays closed. This problem did not affect the security of the mail.Hard to beat for the price. I recommend the product to my friends."
3,MailGuard 579 Mailbox,"I was a little disappointed to find that this mailbox is made out of plastic. I had expected something a big sturdier (like metal). It is a spacious mailbox, and aside from it being made of plastic, my other desire would be for it to open in the back to retrieve the mail, instead of in the front. However, aside from these two things, especially the first one, it is fine."
2,Worth watching,"This offbeat indie movie, shot on location in Charlottesville, Va., has its charms, including an engaging performance by a young January Jones (Mrs. Don Draper). The haunting and inventive musical score is a real high point, creating mystery and suspense, pulling the movie along and holding the viewer's interest."
1,If You Like to Watch Paint Dry....,"If you like to watch paint dry you may enjoy this dull, dreary, amateurishly done production. Even though it came out in 2006 there are zero reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, apparently because it had little or no theatrical release exposure. After watching it I can fully understand why!"
3,Would this help??,I opened my PS2 and connected it to my TV through the VCR with the A/V cable that comes with the PS2. For some reason I can't play Final Fantasy VIII with it. Will this product solve the problem??Thanks.
2,Nothing worth buying,"I bought this at the store hoping it would solve the problem of running my PS2 through my VCR (my TV doesn't have audio/video inputs while my VCR does). Playing DVDs through the VCR degrades the picture, as I'm sure most of you know. After hooking up the adapter, I noticed that it did a good job with the picture, but the audio was horrible. So I went out yesterday and bought a Sony adapter (originally made for the first Playstation, but compatible with the PS2), and all my troubles seem to be over. Skip out on this one. There are better adapters out there."
1,RFU ADAPTER,"This is NOT a Sony product. If you use this item, and anything happens to your PS2, Sony is not responsible. I thought we were getting a Sony product from the description, but once I received it, I found out that this is not true. Plus, it didn't work. So I would reccomend that you buy a Sony adapter. I looked at the other reviews, and other people have had problems with this item."
5,Much Better Than Expected,"My old RFU having died after six months, I ordered this with some trepidation. The reviews were brutal by those who, like me, have older TVs. But to my great relief the unit works fine--no DVD buzzing and popping; the games look and sound fine. It must be a matter of individual televisions, but on an old (12 years) RCA, it works quite well."
1,Don't buy this Adaptor,to any Playstation 2 owner do not buy this adaptor for your PS2 because it will mess up the system and it won't let you play DVD's or DVD-ROM games.it is also recommended by the Sony company that made the PS2 and PSone to not to use this adaptor only use the adaptor that has the Sony Playstation 2 or Sony Playstation logo on the adaptor.
2,Not Worth IT,I bought this in order to easily switch from tv to tv or for those tv's without the av hookups or without a vcr to run through. It makes the picture on dvds and ps2 games very dark. Stick with the one that comes with the ps2 or try a different brand.
3,Defects in Playstation or Interact?,"I have went through two of Interact's RFU adapter's and neither of them worked when I booted my PS2 with them plugged in. I don't know if this is a glitch with Sony or Interact, but if you can go with RCA cables or S-video, do so."
1,serial number,I am looking for an adapter with SCPH-10071 or SCPH-1121 and I can't seem to find it.If anyone have any information I would like to hear it please. Our Playatation2 flips horizonialy. Thank you for reading my review.
3,The RFU Adapter,A well-rounded product made for older T.V.'s so that you can play your system without a VCR. Works very well and is cheap. This is basic hardware for a console.
5,Perfect hard to find gauge,I love dr strings and this 11-50 gauge is perfect for longer scale guitars.because the d and a string is not to heavey. the dime strings are great been using them on and off since they came out. everytime I get something else I wish I had the Dimes'Been playing 19 years playing metal for 11 years .don't listen to that absolute chode who probably never played the strings but just wanted to bad talk dime because he is jealous and has no taste.
5,the best palm m125,Dude you have to get this this is the coolest palm it helps me alot now my mom is soooo happy because now im so organized and im never late to any appointments or i get to play games when im waiting in the docters office for an 1hr thats why you should get the palm m125
1,a waste of money,"This gets one star only because there is no option for ""0"" stars. I got this knife at a Friday sale price (nearly half what it's currently selling for). I had high hopes for this based on some of the other reviews but it would best be described as a ""tomato hacker"". It squashed a nice ripe tomato and was nearly as bad on a firmer one. It does not slice evenly. Save your money and buy a good quality chef's knife for your tomatoes. I recommend the Calphalon 8"" chef which I recently purchased here. It is a beautiful knife."
1,Can't Cut Straight,"If it were worth my time and effort I would return this knife. It won't cut anything straight. Must be a defect in some aspect of the design... to look at the knife it seems fine. No matter what you do... the knife curls to the left when you try to cut through something. I put it in my tool box for cutting cords, twine, etc.! Save your money."
2,Oops! Wrong book :(,"I read the A+ review of Cris Newport's new erotica collection in The Brilliant Review. It said the name of the collection was Afterglow: Exotica. I quickly snapped up this book only to find it wasn't the right one -- I was looking for ""1001 Nights: Exotica."" I read Afterglow, though, and found it did not stand up to my expectations. Many of the stories seemed cliched. I wanted something ""crackling with energy"" (a quote from TBR) but Afterglow fell a little short of crackle."
2,Not very interesting,"While there are some arousing parts to some of these stories, most of them just aren't very interesting. Some of the stories don't make much sense and the characters are silly. If you're looking for some erotica, it's sprinkled here and there, but, if you're looking for good writing and engaging stories, forget this book."
2,too big,it is too much bigger than i imagined. edges are very sharp. i dont really use it after i get.
3,Phoenix pendant,"The pendant is beautiful, however do not try to wear it all the time. We got this for my husband and within a month the wing started to crack and is breaking off."
2,Broke before he could wear it,"I recieved this fast that is why I gave it 2 stars. The down side it was not nearly as clean cut as the picture shows, it appears like there were snags or something in the metal giving it a ruffer apperance.I loved the whole adjustable knot rope that is attached until my boyfriend went to put it on the first time and the knot broke. It would probably take more time and effort to try to get a replacement, so most likely I will just find a different kind of rope for the chain. My boyfriend loved that phenoix because it repersents something special to us. I just wish it would have been of better quailty, but i didn't expect a whole lot for the price."
4,You get what you pay for. But it's still a good buy.,"I ordered two of these: One for me, one for my girlfriend. Shipping was great; The package came well before the Holidays. There were a few scratches on both, but hey. You get what you pay for, right?So far, my girlfriend has had no problems with the necklace, with the exception of it being too pointy. As for myself, the rope on the necklace undid itself after the first few days. But it wasn't a problem for me, since I could just easily tie it back together.I would've given five stars if it weren't for the problems mentioned above. Overall, this is a great buy for people with a tight budget! Especially for starving students like myself!"
1,Very Disappointed,"The item arrived in a timely manner, but within one week it became cracked and a few days later broke completely in half. It was not from improper use or clumsy handling...it is just a piece of junk."
5,Very Nice!,This was a product for myself and I have to say that I am very pleased. The black adjustable cord was something that I did not expect but I do like it because it allows me to be a little more versatile with how I can wear the piece. It does have some weight to it and I must say that I am impressed with the detail of the piece.I have always like the Phoenix and what it represents and how it effects me on a personal level so I can really appreciate the craftsmanship that is put into this piece.I highly recommend this jeweler. I also love the small black pouch that comes along with it to store it. Great buy!
4,Like very much,"Sharp edges was unexpected and I wish the twine was thicker. But overall, like the item very much. And arrived within time frame."
3,More like a keychain than a pendant,"I purchased this as a gift. It is a nice heavy weight. The design itself is beautiful. However, it is quite large. Much larger than I anticipated (even after viewing specs). The wings are sharp edged. It nicked my fingers a bit, like a prickly cactus. I can only imagine what it could do around someone's neck or to their shirt. For a necklace, I'm not all that impressed. I think it's better suited for something to hang from the rear view mirror or a key chain adornment (you'll probably snag your gloves or scratch yourself)."
4,"Good, but too big for me","This product came extremely quickly, the company was quick with email replies, and overall it is a very nice item. However, there was a slight scratch on the front of it (I figured it was just how pewter items are) and it was much too big for me (I'm a girl) to wear. I'm selling it to a guy I know."
1,Bad,"I still have not received this item, not sure what is going on ? If you have any answers I would love to hear about it? Thankx"
5,Very pleased!,"This is an extremely beautiful pendant. I was also surprised at its size. It is bigger than you might suspect, but still a great purchase."
2,Beautiful but useless,"I received this pendant yesterday and I can say it's not what I wanted. The size of the pendant is too big to have it around my neck. It would be a good idea to put a real picture with the pendant hanging from the neck to see the size. If I had known it was so big I wouldn't have ordered it and it's a pity because it's really beautiful but for what, decoration?"
4,Very Cool,"Have only worn it around the house but I love it. Very cool, can't wait to wear it out in public."
4,nice,I loved the size and weight of this item it was exactly what I had wanted the only problem I had was the rope part kept untieing and I was unable to retie it otherwise it was a good purchase.
5,phoenix fire bird,i love the phoenix bird the only problem was that the straw broke so i use a nover one thanks for the sweet necklace dan's jewlery place. nice to buy the pendant from you
4,great,"There was nothing wrong with it at all, it was the right size, it looks nice. the little piece of black rope it came with is dodgy but its not the important part of the item. I read most of the customer reviews on how it might take a while to arrive and i was pleasantly surprised when it arrived 2 weeks before the suggested arrvial time."
4,It's ok.,"I bought this for use with my own chain, so the strap was not an issue. However, when I received the pendant, I thought, this leather strap is not so bad! I would have at least kept the leather strap to switch out, except the only way I could get it off was to cut it off. Maybe I'm just impatient, and didn't feel like dealing with the adjusting knots. Anywho, I also thought ""man this thing is sharp!"" But after having it on a while, I quickly forgot I was even wearing it. I wouldn't want to be wearing it in a fight, or a car accident!! Looks good, but not AS good as some of my other stuff. I think the lack of symmetry between the wings is what bothers me. It also makes the pendant liste to one side ever so slightly. Maybe I'm just too critical?? So I think most people would love the piece, especially for the price. I think I would still buy it knowing all of this."
4,Grades aren't everything,"A fascinating book about the men who graduated from West Point at or near the bottoms of their pre-Civil War classes. As the title implies, Custer and Pickett get the most coverage. However, the book is filled with interesting, insightful, and simply amusing stories about other soldiers. Some, like Whistler, achieved greatness in other fields. Others are not nearly so well-known but had extraordinary lives nonetheless. The writing is sometimes a bit choppy but generally well-done. This is a book for those interested in the Civil War and Frontier period. Even if you are a sophisticated and expert student of the field, there is something new to be found in this book."
2,"Fill her up, with regular unleaded"" check the oil","Basically this documentary has very little to do with oil per se, is much more devoted to the history of the Middle East before World War I which it says in small writing below the term blood and oil this video will give you no information about the oil industry as we know it or any recent history of the Middle East it delivers what it says the history of the Middle East before World War I. With a very clever picture to make it interesting save your money unless you're a Middle East history aficionado respectfully Johnny Irish"
3,Not has bloody as you think,I actually expected more from this for some reason. The fact that it was rated TV MA maybe? Which by the way is largely due to it showing fully drawn breasts. There is a bit of blood but not gory or even necessary sometimes. I would watch (probably not buy) any continuation of the story. Does have some annoying cutesy bits though.
2,Freezing BluRay,"The series got my attention with the artwork on Pandora Satellizer but I rapidly became disappointed. The storyline is well worn anime territory. Boobs and girl-on-girl degradation became just plain dumb. The old ""beat-to-death then come back even more powerful"" was used over and over. The ending indicates a second season but it will have to be really cheap before I will consider entering this storyline again. The blue ray picture is nice. If you like boobs popping out all over then go for it but, maybe I'm getting old, I want a quality story for my time and money."
4,Very Good Anime.,"Interesting story line, but it's too short! Really need to do a second season to tie up alot of secondary story lines!!"
4,not bad,This is not for kids and even though the main story is the fighting the sub stories is what makes this show come together
5,How to Prosper Financially and Spiritually,"I highly recommend this title for people who demand that a book should not just inform, but entertain.I am always interested in how to manage my finances better and how to live ethically in today's gray-colored moral climate. Most books I have read on these subjects, however informative, have not been very interesting.This book is the exception. Written to be read by a broad spectrum of financial sophistication, it kept me interested even through subjects I knew by using entertaining anecdotes and relevant scriptures.This book is a quick read with lots of good tips for people looking to improve their finances. I am going to use it as a gift for some folks who like to borrow money from me."
5,Great book,"I read this book in college, where I borrowed it from the library. Inside the front cover, someone had written the grafitto ""This book is evil, it is a parody of good"". Below that, another ""reviewer"" had scribbled the opposite: ""This book is good, it is a parody of evil"". I weigh in with the latter"
5,Imaginative and Deep,"Back in the 1980s I attended a special seminar. While there the staff ran a game called ""Pruri"". The participants closed their eyes and milled about, asking people ""Pruri?"". If the other person replied ""Pruri?"" the person continued in their quest. If they received no answer they would put their arms onto the shoulders of the person and continue to wander. Eventually chains of silent people emerged. When there were no more wandering people the game ended.I decided it was ridiculous to continue wandering, so I chose to become Pruri. I had a handful of people following me around the game ended. There were other such chains. Others also stepped up to leadership roles.In a like vein Karl Glogauer stepped into his role. He became the Messiah. Is this book really that blasphemous or are the ways of God more subtle than we can imagine? When I finished reading this book I began to wonder if Mr. Moorcock was really writing such a ""blasphemous"" novel?"
5,"The Path is the Man, The Man makes his own Road","Althought I must confess it stroke me at first asbeing a unrespectful and derivative book, furtheranalysis and complete reading has changed myopinion totally.There is an underlying spiritual message in it, how our actions CAN become greater than our expectations, if we are willing to believe things can be better.Glogauer is everyman, troubled by inner demons and yet, capable of the ultimate heroism.Moorcock is a writer of the Man and his willingness to see beyond what is written in Destiny's Book, he is inspired and inspiring."
1,Behold the Man,The premise was intriguing but I found it to be poorly written and boring. My son liked it though since he likes sci-fi
2,Not a masterpiece,"Okay, the author had initially a good idea. He sends Glogauer, the protagonist, to the time when Jesus is about to make his appearance. What happens next is imbued with the classical paradox of time travel (if you know history and if you travel back in time, you can come up with the original idea before it existed. But who got the idea in this case? A vicious circle...). The style is poor, and there are huge gaps in the story. It might have shocked quite a few pious Christians in its time, but I'd say not anymore..."
4,Good punisher book,"I enjoyed the punisher book ""Kingdome Gone"" It was about the punisher going to a tropical paradise on the trail of drug kingpin Hamilton ""Bo"" Greaves. The punisher is smart and tough but so is drug kingpin greaves who puts his tough black henchman against the punisher in a great great fight. the drug kingpin Greaves manages to elude the punisher for awhile and even get off the tropical island but their is a HUGE surprise awaiting for him at the very end!....which I LOVED !!! I thought the punisher book was good. I like the weapons the punisher uses in this book it's pretty cool,plus I also like the drawings. the artist draws the punisher like a crazy man killing beast,which I love. all in all an enjoyable read,punisher fans should like this book. I recommend it!"
5,Life's Layers,"Dar Tomlinson has done it again! Unbreak My Heart shows this author at her finest--giving the reader characters in all their authentic undercurrents. She laces emotional issues with realistic plot points that captivate anyone who enjoys more than a surface read. If you're interested in absorbing two strong minded individuals as they meet and connect, draw lines in the Arizona sand and then learn to compromise without losing their own souls, read this book. As a matter of fact, choose ANY book crafted by Dar Tomlinson and prepare to be riveted to your favorite reading chair."
3,can be better,"The guestbook has lines for Names and Addresses, but it would be better if it list the left column as Names and the right column as Addreses."
5,I LOVED IT!,Product was just like it looked like and was sent pretty quick. I have no complaints. I hope to do business with this seller in the future if needed. Thank you so much.
4,sturdy but small...,"My grandmother gave me this as a gift for my wedding, which is on December 31, 2008. I love it! The only complaint that I have is that it's very thin. It's so ""heavy duty"" and the back is sturdy, but the guestbook just kind of flops open. I saw that one reviewer wrote that not many pages were used. I think that might be because there are so many lines on each page. I don't know. When I opened the box, it looked fine. But it had this styrofoam block inside the guestbook, holding it up and making it look thicker than it really was. When I took the foam out, it just...shrank! I was kind of disappointed. In spite of that, though, it's BEAUTIFUL! The little pen rotator arm is nice and strong and not floppy, and the pen even writes well! It's a beautiful set and I can't wait to display it!"
5,Very good for a membrane keyboard.,"This keyboard has a very nice tactile feel and solid build quality, not as good as a mechanical, but for the price it's great."
1,"cool looking, horrible quality","i don't know if the issue is with amazon or with this robot.i have returned two to amazon at this point, and am looking for another robot.i wanted it as a decoration for my son's birthday party, but the first robot arrived covered with rust spots and fingerprint smudges--obviously not new.it also didn't include the crank, so who knows if it actually moved.i returned it for another and that one came with more rust, more fingerprints, and a detached head!i tried my best to put the head back on, but it just wasn't happening.i think if you want this on a shelf and don't feel like touching it or moving it, it's cool looking, but if you actually want it to move around and look decent, i wouldn't purchase it here.you'll probably get my returns and have to go through the same ordeal."
5,Best day I've spent in months!,"Well, I finally took a day off yesterday to do nothing but read. I started ""Killer Chameleon"", and literally didn't put it down until I finished this very early am...and I'm really not a morning person. It was wonderful! And I was so glad to see Leigh Ann back and with Duck (love him!). As usual, Chassie West writes superbly; never slackening the tension or giving too much away too soon. Her characters are believable, unlike so many these days, and likeable.I'm thinkin' mini-series/on going series here...CBS?NBC?ABC? How about it? Grab this series before USA or TNT does. (How cool would this be if someone really did make this a mini-series/tv/series?!)"
1,gag,"DISGUSTING ! I bought a case of this thinking it would be great for my kid, but he would not drink it and said it was nasty. I thought it couldn't be that bad and figured I'd have to drink it. ITS THAT BAD!a year later and i am throwing it all away. Neither of us could force ourselves to drink more than a sip or two. it is that YUCK! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. Wish I had mine back."
1,Interesting Information not worth the Price,"While the volume presents a very well documented history of the American Theater organ and it's artists, there is simply not enough meat to the book to warrant the ... price. You surely have access to a computer or you would not be able to read this review. Save your money and spend more time researching the web. You will find most of the information in this book on the web."
5,Thank You Santa,My child was very happy with his gift. And so was his parents. I just wish Santa would've bought his sisters from you. We are all VERY happy with Santa this year. When we need to get another one it will be from here. Thank You so much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Shawn McQuistion
4,Good giant panda for the price!,"I read other reviews on Amazon about the bear before purchasing, so I was ready for the initial shedding. When it arrived, I went through about 10 lint roller sheets, going over the entire bear. This seemed to accelerate and alleviate the shedding before my daughter ever got her hands on the bear.Otherwise, the bear is definitely large but not too heavy, which is great. The bear has been pulled and carried by just about every part of his body (ears, arms, legs, etc) and has withstood the treatment. I think my daughter will only grow to enjoy him more and more as she gets bigger and is better able to handle him! I would say that his fur is a little more coarse than I thought it would be, but he is apparently soft enough for snuggling, at least in my daughter's opinion."
3,"Big & huggable, but sheds a lot.","I got this Giant Panda for my girlfriend and it was as big and huggable as I wished...she loved it.However, it sheds way more than I would expect any stuffed animal should. It's kinda of annoying as a result and the stuff can get in your mouth. Bleh. If it weren't for the shedding, this product would be amazing."
4,Huggable and Lovable,The panda was alot larger than I had expected and was a great deal for the price. I was a little unhappy with how easily the fur came out and hope that it doesn't continue to do so. It is very soft!!
5,Awesome and Sweet,Very Good gift to get a woman for a bed companion without offering yourself :) Very Plush and nice eye candy.
4,Life sized Panda Stuffy,"My 9 yr old daughter received this life sized Panda stuffy as a Christmas present and she LOVES it. From the reviews that I read I was led to believe that this panda would shed some (which it does) but that it would be SUPER soft...which it isn't. It's soft, but definitely not SUPER soft. My daughter hasn't seemed to notice and she sleeps with 'Bamboo' at the head of her bed. I think the picture of the panda is also a little cuter than the actual panda itself. In the end, my daughter is THRILLED with her new BFF...she even beaded him a necklace!"
1,sheds non stop,"This panda looks good but unfortunately it sheds so much that you have hairs stuck on you with the most gentle stroke. It's also not soft at all. The material is made of some cheap synthetic fur that's definitely a health hazard if you have allergies. The only use I can see with this is a plain decorative figure in the corner of a room w/ a sign that says ""do not touch""."
1,Hole in Head,"when i got the bear there was a Big hole in seam on the head. bear smells old, likes its been sitting in a wharehouse for 10 or 20 years."
2,Not at all life like!,"In the description it said, ""Life like features"" but it was not even close. Panda was big but its hands are very 'Plasticy' and distorted.My wife did not like this big lump of stuffing."
5,"Good quality, much better than expected",I buy large bears for the kids in our family when they are around 18 months old. Every kid needs a bear bigger than themselves. This bear is of very good quality and cost much less than other bears found at local stores that are thesame size and lesser quality. This was a great buy for a large bear.
5,Better than expected!,"""Pandy"" came as a surprise to a wonderful little girl, she loved it and slept with it the very first night she got it. I am 100% satisfied with this product. I would have paid 100.00 for it."
3,BIG PANDA,Its nice big and fluffy. But the fur comes out ALOT and it loses its size in like a month or so. The black fur gets all over your room and just gets everywhere and messy to clean up
2,Cheap stuff,"Though my little daughter loves this Panda, it is very cheaply made. It keeps shedding and I have to take the fur out of my child's mouth all the time. Overall rating is ** just because I would rather pay a premium for a high quality toys, rather than get irritated by fishing the fur from my baby's mouth."
4,Good for people with neck injury issues,"The picture on the cover is accurate, the neck is supported so the shoulders can relax and the spine can stay aligned -- it is not feather soft or plush because if it were it wouldnt give the support advertised -- having been in 2 car accidents, regular pillows only make things worse, so I am very glad I found this product. Ever wary of ""As seen on TV"" but, very glad I bought this pillow."
2,Not that great,"This pillow is not as good as others I have slept on. I wish I would have just gone to a store and picked one out. To me it just seems like a different type of foam, the shape is nice , but it doesn't do a very good job of molding around my body as other memory foam pillows have that I have tried. Please go and hand pick a pillow out at a store."
4,Good affordable option,"If you're looking for a foam pillow with that distinctive wave contour, this one is pretty darn good. Keep in mind, though, that this isn't a Tempur-Pedic or other such name brand, so it's not something you'll be pressing your hand to and seeing a handprint, as the above image suggests. It's about a third of the price of the name brand, which is nice. The foam does mold to your head and the contour offers great support for me. The foam is comfortable despite a bit of an odd packaged smell that (purportedly) will fade over time. I've had mine for a week and I'm enjoying it."
5,Best stuff on earth!,"Memory foam is quite a wonderful invention. I truly believe it is the softest surface I have ever slept on in my life! I discovered it personally in Memphis, Tennessee at a Days Inn - liked it so much, we came home and purchased one for ourselves. It's fantastic."
1,Don't get this one!,CHEEZY! The photo makes it look so plush. It is very small and is losing it's shape the more use it gets. Move along...there are btter ones out there.
2,Must be some kind of joke,Why in the world would Amazon evening sell this. At best it can make a second string dog toy. I can't even find the word to express my disappointment in this product. This is something they should be using for shipping fillers. This pillow is very low and too soft...it may be good for a toddler? You would a have a good chance of wake up with a serious crook in the neck if you think this buy is a steal.
1,It made my neck problem even worse,"Ever since I started using this pillow my neck hurts even more. At first I thought my body was just getting used to it, but it's been a month and my back and my neck hurt even worse than they used to. The material of the pillow case is very rough, and you can feel that over the time, it would cause early aging to your face, so I would recommend to buy a silky pillow case to avoid this, but in any case I wouldn`t recommend this pillow at all."
4,just like i remembered!,"i have been waiting for this title to become available again as i had the album in the 80's. it's just i fun album, i think the best songs moe and joe did together are on this cd!"
4,Mini Salt & Pepper Shakers,The look and size of these shakers is just perfect. The only trouble I had was screwing the tops back on after filling them.
2,this book doesn't wash,"I usually enjoy A. Scott's books, more for the historical feel than anything else. But DGames is really too bad. Nicholas is a prig or a jerk or whatever you want to call him. Melissa is a twit. With most of Scott's work, DGames has no passion between the two main characters. There was definitely no passion in this book. Possibly my favorite of Scott's books is Highland Fling. Maggie is spirited and Ned is neat. They shared about as much feeling between characters as you are going to find in one of Ms Scott's books. I love historical romance, but please liven up your work Ms Scott. There needs to be some spark between your lovers."
3,a bargain at an auction,"amanda scott likes to write about the situation of women and the (to our day) awful laws that women had to put up with. This story continues the melissa seacourt story giving the details that were just hinted at in the dangerous illusions book. Seacourt is abusive, the women he abused often did not fight back. This also touches on gambling habits and the dangers of gambling. The characters are not the most brave, heroic, bold people, but more real to life. AS bad as such problems are today, it helped me to realize these problems probably existed in 1824 and the solutions were much more difficult. I am hoping the next book in the series is a bit lighter and has more humor in it."
1,"OFF THE USUAL TRACK, WRITTEN IN 1996!","MUCH DISAPPOINTED BUT PUT IN PERSPECTIVE, I SUPPOSE, I HAVE BEEN READING MS. SCOTTS HISTORICAL ROMANCE NOVELS FROM MOST RECENT TO OLDEST. RETROSPECTIVELY, IT SEEMS AS THOUGH SHE LOST HER USUAL FOOTING HERE BUT QUICKLY FOUND IT AGAIN IN HER OTHER BOOKS. DO NOT GIVE UP ON THIS AUTHOR FROM THIS ONE BOOK. YOU WILL ENJOY ALL THE OTHERS!!!!!!!!(review written 2/2008)"
3,Smells nice but ... made me break out,"I struggle with adult acne and am in the market for a moisturizer that won't make me break out and isn't full of chemicals. Based on the reviews, I thought this was worth a short. Unfortunately, it's not a good fit for me and I'm struggling with breakouts. I used consistently for about 4 weeks because I wanted to give it a fair chance but this can't continue."
5,Absolutely love it!,"This moisturizer is great! I typically have pretty oily skin and I love how this feels when I put it on at night. It's light and doesn't feel greasy, like many others I've tried. The only problem is that I can't wait for this to come back in stock! I've read that they were relocating and wouldn't be available again until July 15th, so I'm getting pretty anxious."
1,Made My Skin More Dry,I wanted to love this product!I have sensitive skin and was looking for a change from Dr. Weil (not that I was unhappy but. Have been using Origins for years and thought I would try something new). My skin got drier and I broke out in a small rash on my nose.
2,Too expensive,For such a basic moisturizer that is not even organic it's too expensive.but I didn't use it for very long. It did give the smooth feeling to my skin but nothing super special that a regular drugstore creme can't do. I returned it.
2,Expectations Too High,"I purposely waited to write my review so that I could use this Amazing cream awhile. Now, I can say that I will use the cream, but will not purchase again and it is not because of the price. I didn't find it amazing, just okay . I had a couple of bad one pimple breakouts when I used it around eye area (at the bottom above my cheeks) and around my nose on the side in the indented area. The directions stated this cream could be used around the eye area and that was a plus for me, especially since it is all natural, but it didn't agree with me and my skin (dry)."
4,Excellent!,"This CD is excellent! The theme songs, espeically Voyager are exciting and uplifting. The suite to ""The Inner Light"" is the highlight of this CD's. Now, if it contained the First Contact theme, it would be complete!"
5,A very good CD for the star trekker,I've been waiting to get the tv themes and have found it in this CD. I especially like the voyager extended play theme. A must for trekkers
2,Not what was expected,I ordered this product expected to get tape with the Nylon Zipper and did not receive. Sent them an email and they told me I could purchase it at there cost...I asked them to send me a postage paid envelope to send back and never received a response. Poor customer service.
4,Rewarding story of recovery,"Amy is devastated by the accidental death of her young child and locks herself into a cold internal prison of self-loathing. Unable to cope with her emotions, she decides not to feel at all.Jesse is equally distraught by the death of his son, but wants to deal with his loss. Every attempt to approach Amy is met with ice, driving him over the edge to take comfort in alcohol.The story is not maudlin or sentimental. The death of the little son is at the root of the issues, but the focus is on the actual emotional turmoil in Amy and Jesse.Events and new people in their lives encourage and even force change, breaking down the walls and allowing a new beginning.The book is a slow melting of the ice in their lives, but the writing kept me turning the pages without ever skipping a line.This book does not quite reach the emotional intensity ofHis Secondhand WifeandThe Tenderfoot Bride, but it has depth and is a rewarding story."
2,Life on the old-time prairie,"I'd read other reviews elsewhere praising this book as true-to-life depiction of Western Life with all its hardship, and was looking forward to reading it. But instead I found it very disappointing and hard to finish. While the writer's research was accurate, the town and home did not seem real. The story is dull and predictable, and it is hard to worry or care about these characters, they've been done so many times in other books. Pass."
2,Hit and Miss Halloween Rock!,This comp. put out by Fiend Force records in Germany is a real hit and miss deal. The overall feel of the disc suffers in my opinion from the pop-punk disease. Such as the opener from arizona's Calabrese. Most of the production is straight forward and sonicaly pleasing but that's about it. Don't waste $15 on 3 or 4 good songs.
3,Well produced.....but,"Whenever Jay B produces an album, I always either pick it up or a copy is sent to me. The label didnt even want me to hear this album....so I picked one up anyway.Why do so many bands want to be RATM? It's hard rock, yeah, and its in tune. But there are things missing and things that are theyre and things that shouldnt be there. Drumming is sub-par and the guitar could be a little diverse.This singer sings about the ill's of the US Media and Gov't....this for a band from Australia who just came over to record. Hmmm, he's not teaching (or convincing me) of anything.This album would get 4 stars if the singer's topics were differant. Music itself rocks, it just seems phoney. This album is very hard, but very fake. If you like Australian rock, check out Pacifier or D4."
3,they got the crunchy guitars...thats bout it,"i heard of full scale thru rene mata,a&r of columbia records,who proceeded to get full scale signed.hailing from australia,full scale deliver a sort of politic rock,sort of a modern rock version of RATM.the guitars are good and crunchy and the drums pound away,but the singer needs some fine tuning..ok more than that.it almost seems like he's crooning and moaning rather than singing.hell the guy even laughs during verses its just odd.the band is good but if they received a gift in the form of a vocalist,they could go places."
2,Another Oliver disappointment,"What has happened to Ms. Oliver? Having read all of her earlier books, I eagerly looked forward to her Regencies, however she seems to be losing her touch. More than anything the characters in this most recent work are shallow, bland and uninteresting......both bloodless protagonists. We can only hope that Ms. Oliver returns to the intriguing plots and complex people of her older novels."
5,Wonderful for Imaginative Play,This is a great tent! My two daughters play in it every day. It is very easy to set up and is sturdy and well constructed. The tent part is made up of netting and cotton pieces- very well sewn. This part actually velcros to the cushion so it maintains the open space inside. Very cool. The three pockets inside are great for storing books or stuffed friends.I would recommend this tent to anyone. Don't look any further!
1,Missing Hardware and is that Wood Putty???!!!,"Not only was there no hardware (screws, dowels, etc...) but on one of the end pieces, it was obviously damaged wherever they make this thing and they ""tried"" to fix it by smearing wood putty over one of the sides. THEY DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER TO SAND IT!!! So now one side has this smear of colored wood putty along the side. (Imagine an 83 Cutlass with a rusted hole in the door, sealed with bondo and you'll get the image)What a bummer. Another company that obviously cares more about the allmighty dollar and not the customer."
2,Poor instructions for assembly,"I found this basically impossible to put together. The assembly instructions are terrible and I don't know if my unit was defective , but mine WILL NOT go together at all. To ship this back will be a nightmare with it's weight. I was not happy with the instructions. The shelf looks nice, just will not go together no matter how you try it. I will not buy any more of this type ."
1,NO ASSEMBLY HARDWARE INCLUDED,"Not only was there no assembly hardware included, but I have been unable to contact anyone by e-mail or telephone to request what I need to assemble this item. VERY UNHAPPY FORMER CUSTOMER"
2,Another case of no assembly hardware,"It will hopefully be a pretty sturdy storage unit, but for now its just a few pieces of wood in my spare bedroom because there weren't any screws or any other assemby hardware in the box. Target customer service was pretty helpful and they're shipping an entire new bookcase, so hopefully shipment #2 will contain the assembly pieces."
4,Wonderful product but,"hard to read/follow directions. While putting the piece together, just maintain that part C should be facing you at ALL times. This allows for very easy assembly. Wonderful color and very sturdy. I thought it was small at first, but it holds a 19 inch TV, dvd and vhs combo player with a V-Smile (all on top) in my 3 year old's room. He loves the idea that he has all of his movies and some favorite reading books on the second shelf. Also provides nice storage space for all of the smaller items in the bins (legos/waffle blocks/cars). I plan on purchasing other wood products from tykes and would recommend them to all parents."
3,Wouldn't work with my gauge.,VDO makes a lot of different gauges and they all seem to take a different kind of sensor but there's no cross reference telling which one to use. This one didn't work with my gauge so I had to buy another one at NAPA.
4,Thumbs up,"A great defining voice of an era of my life and this nation, A break through in the evolution of Haiti Compa style of sound and lyrics. Very alive and full of heart free message combine with a revolutionary style which should be duplicated by more - i'm glad it's available on here and can forever be shared and heard by friends, people of the world."
1,Dissapointed,Just bought this disk. The music is great but its impossible to download all these songs on computer. I don't need this video with interview-- I need songs. What is the point to buy such SD?
4,Takes a few listens - but worth it!,"The first two tracks on this CD will grab you immediately - no doubt. They are powerful, punchy and very original. The rest of the CD is decent, with some gems and a couple of misses. The four members play really well together and each is obviously a master at his craft. I would have liked to see more songs like the first two tracks. I'd give this CD five stars if it wasn't for their butchering of Track 10 which is much better on their revelation EP. Additionally, the production on the disc is subpar, the vocals are turned too high and the overall clarity just isn't there. Overall, it's a good listen. It's been in my CD player for weeks now and I'd think it's coming out for a while. There EP on revelation is better though."
4,A superior alternative to The Darkness,"**3.5 stars**It's not like I think this is a great album, but it has it all over The Darkness if what you want is shades of '80s-style pop metal (mixed with early-'90s punk-metal). It's the latter elements that give Christiansen an edge despite being pretty accessible and hook-laden. Whereas The Darkness is basically a joke that barely worked for half an album, 'Stylish Nihilists' actually has some substance to the songs and you'll want to play a number of them over and over."
1,Wonderful,"Django and Stephane are musical geniuses from my youth, growing up in Europe, until I left in 1961 to come to the USA. They were outstanding musicians and Django, not even being able to read music and having a deformed hand due to an accident, was perj=haps the greatest guitar player of all time, at least I think so. Stephane, with his magical Jaxx violin, was equally ingenious and together they create Heaven on Earth for me."
4,This is a fun book to read,"Very few people put any trust in NASA, so it's very possible what this guy is saying is true."
4,Nice Holiday Background,"This is a unique type of DVD. The sounds and sights of New York at Christmas time. Having spent many years there I ordered this with interest. The DVD is intended to be played as background while having a party, opening gifts, etc. I suggest playing and watching once and you will get a flavor of the variety that is New York at Christmas time."
1,What a disappointment!,"The positive reviews on this product are outright lies. The footage is grainy, outdated, and mostly boring. Most was shot in dreary grey weather. With so many wonderful things to capture in NYC, they must have gone out of their way to get so many shots of bundled up people trudging along grey slushy streets. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this!"
1,boring,"boring DVD of a ghost town, without people, decorated with millions of light bulbs, accompanied with depressive music. Too much of scene repetition. I 've never been in NY on Christmas and after this DVD I am not intending to. Do not buy it!"
2,Very disappointing,"I am seriously baffled that this DVD was reviewed as highly as it is. I think it's just plan awful. My theory behind the high ratings is that it brings joy to former New Yorkers in it's nostalgia for their favorite Christmas haunts. Unfortunately, I found the camera work to be just plain awful. I played it on my bigscreen and actually got slightly motion sick in places, as the camera swayed and shook. The editing was terrible and many of the shots were questionnable. Indeed, I can see that the sights in New York are breathtaking, but I believe a more adept camera person would have caught them better."
3,christmas music,"this dvd is just xmas music only and visits around new york, it shows some nice houses with the decorations and all lights on, it can be boring at times for the length of it. and there is some repeats of the same scenes over and over again. the scenes of the city new york are very good and color is good, but again it is only a once a year to watch. the tunes are of xmas only for me Id rather have the likes of Max Steiner Or Erich Wolfgang Korngold with his film music all the way through. but for anyone who likes this type of music then it is good to buy. I prefer a narration to anything like this type of movie, sombody like Morgan Freeman to tell you of the story anyway its your choice and after you watch it then its back on the shelf till next time around."
5,Great Holiday Gift Item!,I got one of these last Christmas and just ordered five to give as gifts this Christmas. Anyone who's visited New York at Christmas time will want to have this and anyone who's never visited New York at Christmas time SHOULD have this!
2,Old footage of New York City,"This DVD was a disappointment!! I thought it was going to be about New York...throughout the state...homes, etc. Footage amateurish...not enjoyable to watch...music okay however...Would not purchase this again..."
5,A warm & fuzzy feeling from this DVD,"If you can't get to New York City to experience the holiday season, this is the next best thing. It shows all the beautiful sights of the city decorated for the holiday season while you listen to wonderful Christmas music. You will not be disappointed. I'm very happy with my purchase."
1,"Poor Picture Quality, shakey camera, amatuer video","I regretfully must say I should have paid more attention to the previous reviews regarding this Christmas in NY DVD, before I purchased it. If you are looking for a professional looking DVD, with exceptional clarity and scenery, this is not the video to purchase. Regardless of it being filmed in New York, the quality of this DVD is awful. As others stated, the camera is shakey and the same scenes were repeated numerous times. I could only watch 10 minutes of it before I notified Amazon that I was going to return it. The images were grainey, dark and dismal with many shots of people walking by and in front of the camera. To uphold Amazon's good name, they should remove it from being sold on their website. Now I know why there was no sample clip to see prior to purchasing."
3,"Its OK, some scenes are great some really really boring.","Some of the scenes of New York are fantastic, but a lot of really boring stuff too. A model railroad, etc. Music is traditional. Good background music and video while the holiday party is in progress."
3,DVD --Christmas in N.Y,"This could have been spectacular but there is no-one narrating through the entire 1 1/2 hrs.Therefore, we don't know what we're seeing in alot of cases.Especially hotels.How are we supposed to do research and stay there if we're not given information? Don't bother renting....specials on TV are better."
2,IT'S ONLY 26 MINUTES LONG!!!,"Fooled again. I should've counted the minutes before buying.It's kind of a psychedelic mess; producer trying to copy the Fugs.It's just a bunch of noise to listen to while under the influence ofsomething. Maybe a couple interesting tunes buried under the pile.Actually, the liner notes by Peter Stampfel are more fulfilling than therecording."
3,Good listen,"This album is a very quickly put together album, whilst on a few psychedelic drugs as well. That's probably what is responsible for most of the good things and also a few of the lesser good things about this album :)It's a fantastic listen, but it loses it's excitement after the first few times, quite quickly."
5,Canon ink cartridge,"What a deal I got on this new, in the box, Canon ink cartridge! Fantastic. I will always look on Amazon before I look anywhere else!"
5,Canon ink,"As described. Canon branded ink at a reasonable price. Shipped as 4 separate cartridges (in same shipping box), not one 4-pak."
5,Canon Ink multipack,"This my 4 times order canon ink Multipack BCI-3e and CLI8 all was very good, that's why I keep ordering from Amazon.com"
3,Product as stated but appears to be old stock,"Product appears to be about 5 years old. This may or may not be an issue in that, for some reason, Canon used to feel the need to date their inks. Have not yet used to ink to determine its quality."
5,Canon Ink = Quality,"I agree with other reviewers, genuine Canon ink is great and worth it. I know that ink is one of those over priced things and I do wish it were cheaper. However, I've read several articles talking about color fade problems with inkjet ink. One review I read online compared a variety of year-old prints using different refills and genuine ink brands. I think all except one refill brand was almost completely faded. I don't have the article anymore but I remember that Canon's ink remained very non-faded. I can personally attest to this. My wife and I used our Canon i850 to print several of our wedding pictures on photo paper. Seven years later these photos all look great. One in particular is at my mom's house and is kept out in the dining room (which is a pretty sunny room during the day) and shows no signs of fading after all this time."
4,Satisfied Customer,Purchasing my ink cartridges through amazon.com not only saved me money but it was easy and convenient. I saved over $10.00 from the purchase price at my local Staples store and recieved my purchase in less than 7 days through the mail.
1,Highly Suspicous Packaging,"The product did not arrive in the packaging pictured, but in a cheap cardboard box unlike any other Canon ink I've purchased before. There is no Canon holographic seal on the product. Its all highly irregular when put together.The product comes as 4 individual inkjet cartridges, but the packaging differs slightly from previous Canon cartridges that I have purchased in the past. I have very serious concerns that these are not Canon sourced products."
1,This is not a Canon product!!,"The picture and description show that this an actual Canon ink cartridge, but what I received was a knock-off brand made in China in a yellow and blue box! Buyer beware..."
1,Ad stated (and photo showed) Canon BCI-3eBK ink. Received knock-off brand instead.,"Ad clearly stated (and showed photo of) Canon BCI-3eBK ink. Instead I received a knock-off brand named ""OA100"" which had ""Made in China"" stamped on the bottom its package. I then went through the steps at Amazon to get refunded... which first requires me to email the company. The company never responded to my email but did refund my full purchase price once I filed the claim with Amazon. Maybe just a mix up on their part since the company has mostly (and many) positive ratings. Guess I get to list 3 knock-off brand cartridges on ebay now! :)"
5,Worth using the original,"As previously said, nothing beats OEM materials when quality matters; especially since Canon makes better than average inks and papers. I not only had poor results with off-brand inks before, but actually had much shorter catridge life as well.The only beef I've had is that they use the same model number (BCI-3e) for both the photo and non-photo versions. THEY ARE NOT INTERCHANGABLE! I got photo ink for my i850 by mistake and the results were horrible."
3,"Is it fresh, virgin Canon? or not?","Although the cartridges look like genuine Canon, and work adequately, they did not come in the Canon packaging shown in the illustration---which I find worrisome.The price I paid ($27) I paid is the price of fresh genuine virgin Canon, not the price of a cheap refills, OEM, 3rd-party cartridges, counterfit cartridges, or out-of-date repackaged cartridges.Unfortunately, everytime I order ink cartridges, the vendor(s) are never the same. I suggest contacting the seller and asking for assurance that the product is fresh virgin original Canon cartridges in original Canon packaging before purchasing."
4,"Ink what can I say, it not the ink but the printer",I have one of the last 8.5 x 14 in scanners and printers you can find in this category. Amazon price is very competitive for canon cartridges. I don't use refills.
1,Get rid of your inkjet!,"Man, I am so tired of buying these stupid cartridges for my Canon printer. I am gettind rid of it after these run out. Even when printing black and white and greyscale, it still sucks up the color cartridges! What a waste of resources. I will be getting rid of my MP750 and getting a laserjet, much more efficient. The only thing I really like about the 750 I have is the duplex feature. Still, these stupid cartridges are the straw on my camel's back."
2,Unhappy.,"The shipment got lost and I never got a replacement or partial credit for shipment. They tried to help to see if they could findthe shipment but they could not get any results. Anyway I am out ofmy money and cartridges. Always get insurance for your packages, they could get lost as mine did."
3,Not Canon packaging,"Although the cartridges look like genuine Canon, they did not come in the Canon packaging shown in the illustration---which I find worrisome.The price I paid ($27) I paid is the price of fresh genuine virgin Canon, not the price of a cheap refills, OEM, 3rd-party cartridges, counterfit cartridges, or out-of-date repackaged cartridges.Amazon promptly offered a full refund (if I ship the cartridges back), but that really doesn't solve the issue.I suggest contacting the seller and asking for assurance that the product is fresh virgin original Canon cartridges in original Canon packaging before purchasing."
4,Canon worth the money,I've tried refills and non-Canon products. They simply do not work well with our Canon Pixma ip5000. I only buy these.
2,2 Canon 3E blk cart.,"The Canon ink cartridges were not in the factory pack as illustrated in your ad , but were sent in a cardboard box, loose with no Canon literature and certainly no blister pack. Both ink cartridges were as if they had been removed from Canon's normal blister-pak."
5,Pixma IP4000 owners BEWARE!,"I can't criticize these cartridges, but the ""helpful"" Amazon tool that advises buyers of printer compatibility is WAY OFF on this one. It says they are compatible with the IP4000, and I fell into the trap and ordered them. Nothing on the box suggests this compatibility, so I asked a Canon technician. The answer: ""The Canon BCI-3e Color Ink Tank is not one of the ink tanks that is recommended for your IP4000. The BCI-6 is the right color ink tank for your printer."" Thanks, Canon, and ""thanks a lot,"" Amazon. Now I have to return them and hope Amazon takes responsibility for misleading me."
4,I'll use them again,Best price out there for this item when I bought it. Seems like individual cartridges had been repackaged but works fine.
5,Excellent Product & Arrived Promptly,This item arrived quickly and is just as described. My only gripe is the packaging: It requires heavy-duty scissors to cut open.
1,not as shown,it was shown as a cannon ink tank when it arrived it was a innovera ink tankif I had know it was not a cannon ink tank I would not have purchased it.the last time I used a remanufactured ink tank I had to replace my printer head which was over $70.00.this product may be ok but I am not willing to take the risk.they should have made it clear it was not a real cannon ink tank
2,No idea how to rate - our printer is listed but this is the wrong one.,"Our printer is listed on this package, however it is cleary the wrong cartridge. Ours uses the 220 which is shorter. Rather than trust the package check your cartridge prior to ordering. The number is clearly visible."
3,hmmm....,i'm glad i had a gift card because i would not have brought this for over $30...that's too much...you can go to walmart and get it for cheaper...it wasn't broken or opened so that was good
3,Ink is Ink or Is It?,"We all know by now that printer manufacturers made 90% of their money on ink. In fact, I think I just saw a WSJ review that said that 60% of all HP profits came from ink. I believe it - even if I misquoted it. Whether Canon or HP, this stuff is expensive, especially if you print photographs, and especially if they're 8x10s. (Add another 50 a sheet for the Canon glossy paper!) As careful as I am in selecting such photos, I replace the black cartridge about once a month; the cyan, yellow, etc. about every 3 months.Quality is great, as good as HP. (Others have been inconsistent.) But the price is ridiculous especially since I return the empty cartridges, so I've spent $25 on maybe 4 ounces of ink. I'm seriously thinking of trying the refill services. New printers are cheap..."
2,don't let the title fool you,"I purchased this book thinking it was actually a ""New Testament"", but really it's a dictionary. If you're looking towards a Greek/Spanish New Testament, good luck. If you're looking towards a Dictionary I'd recommend the ""Complete Vocabulary Guide to the Greek New Testament"". It's VERY helpful and less expensive."
3,"Not great, but not bad either","There really is no alternative to the excellent Dual Shock controller, but Interact tried anyway with the StormChaser. It has a good grip, but some of the buttons are hard to reach. And what kind of name is ""StormChaser""?"
2,CONTROLLER IS A WASTE OF MONEY,"this controller is bulky, its not very comfortable the bottom line is even if you think your hands are big enough to handle it, buy a regular dual shock 2 controller thats what i did pay another 5 bucks and you'll save yourself a lot of trouble, the program function is useless, the analog joysticks are too tight, the two extra buttons are just plain annoying, and the shoulder buttons are impossible to use, by the way it look like something batman would use"
2,not average,"thois controller is good but it does have problems.#1 the sides of the controller are good for larger hands like that of shaq but for us smaller peeps it makes it too hard to press the buttons#2 the analogs are hard to reach because of the placemens of the grips.#3start and select buttons are hard to reach.#4 the shoulder buttons are very hard to reach and are put at an awkward angle .#5 too rounded. slips out of your hands if you dont get a good enough grip.the controller isnt crap, it is just angles for a more bigger handed gamer. if you are feeling fine with the dual shock 2 and want another controller and if your hands are small, dont get it. opt for a regular dualshock or a dual shock 2 only diff between these 2 is the colour"
1,Don't Waste your money!,This is a piece of shoddy merchandise. I managed to break the left joystick in less than an hour of playing. My Sony controller on the other hand is almost a year old and isn't broken yet.
1,Waste of Money!,I recently bought one of these last month for multiplayer games with friends. I tried it out to make sure everything was okay then I shelved it for two weeks. My friend and I went to play two weeks ago and the thing didn't work! The only thing that worked was R1. What a piece of junk! I've tried it on all my friends PS2's and they all have the same results. So save yourself some money and get something else.
2,"Okay, but Just isn't right for GT3",The StormChaser is an OK controller but I prefer the Sony DualShock 2 better. My reason is I love GT3 and when I play it it just automatically lets off the gas and this problem doesn't happen with Dual Shock 2 so I think that Dual Shock 2 is better for GT3 fans otherwise it's a great controller.
3,DECENT FOR SOME PEOPLE,"This controller is a little big and bulky. Luckily, I have big enough hands to use it. For those with tiny hands, don't buy this. My other problem with the controller is the placement of two extra buttons that substitute for L1 and R1. Instead of 4 well-placed buttons, you get six. I never use the extra two buttons and sometimes I accidentally hit them, especially in a crucial part of the game. With that said, I've gotten used to this controller and will stick with it."
1,Stormchaser,"Basically, this controller is an uncomfortable excuse for a game pad. It only lasted me about four months. Then one of the prongs fell out of the plug. What great quality."
3,Only rapid fire controller I could find.,"This controller is awkward. It's too large and I have big hands. The analog sticks don't control as well as the dual shock 2. The rapidfire functions are easy to use, but instructions to use the other features aren't there. Also, the rapidfire can be unreliable, cutting off for brief moments here and there. If you need rapidfire, than get this. If you are looking for a cheap second controller, buy something else."
1,Such Great Quality That It's Terrible,"Basically, this controller is an uncomfortable excuse for a gaming pad. It only lasted me about four months. Then, one of the prongs on the plug plucked out. What great quality.The only reason that I bought this controller was for its Turbo function but even that didn't work great for me. Not to mention that it's virtually impossible to grip and all that the rubberized pads on the handle do is make your hands smelly and sore. Stick with Sony on this one and buy a Dual Shock 2."
4,Don't start here,"This is a fantastic book, but if you're new to pure Advaita, this is the wrong place to ""start"". Tony's book will assume you've already done some homework. I would highly suggest you start withwith Nisargadatta Maharaj and even better Ramesh Balsekar. Tony's is the purest, most uncompromising, presentation of Advaita you can probably dig up. It WILL confuse you if you're a beginner and it WILL appear contradictory, however, for those in the know about one's ""true"" nature then all becomes radically clear and you will rapidly discover Tony's message is absolute non-dualism philosophy at its best!"
5,Direct pointing to IT,"Some ""Advaita"" teachers talk about surrender, or, acceptance, but, unwittingly introduce new concepts which binds. For example, total surrender implies there is an object to surrender to.Tony Parsons speaks directly and clearly. There is no need to rely on concepts. I have read many ""Advaita"" books and listened to many teachers but Tony Parsons stands out as the most lucid and direct of them all."
1,good product/bad customer service,"these sleeves are great for protecting your 8x10's. just pray that you don't have any problems with your order. in times of ""overseas"" customer service, you'd normally be ecstatic to speak to a real american. not so with this company. rude and completely unwilling to help is this companies attitude towards their customers. thank god that amazon does care about their customers. after this company mis-listed their product and shorted me on my shipment, they said ""too bad, you're out of luck"". amazon ate the difference and refunded me, for what this company cheated me (total qauntity paid for was not delivered) in their false listing. make sure you make a copy of the product listing when you purchase from these people. you will need it as proof later when they send you a fraction of what you bought."
1,Death to Disney !!!,"No more Battlizers, crossover team ups , Mega Battles , new movies , American made ranger suits ( including the Dino RPM Rangers) , old school rangers back from retirement and real new seasons. Thats how much Disney really cares about the fans , by taking out as much of power rangers as possible until they decide to cancel and break our hearts even more . Season 18 wasn't even a real new season , just a terribly updated version of season 1. I hate disney with a passion because they took all that out. If Haim Saban was able to continue the show with wild force while moving it from fox to Disney, why couldn't disney have dune the same with power rangers samurai during the shows move to Nickalodeon? Death to Disney !!!"
1,A boring book,"After reading numerous leadership books, and as an MBA student I was greatly disappointed by this book. The book was very dry. The leadership concepts that the authors wrote about were conventional concepts that I had known about for many years. It is a shame that so many intellectual minds cannot write a better book. The book is a hard read and the reader will most likely fall sleep before finishing the first chapter."
2,History books,"I purchased this book as a required text in a graduate level class. The copyright is 1999, which means a lot has happened since then. Nearly everything in the world including change management has been severely impacted by the economic events of 2006 and beyond. As a history book, this has some validity. As a current tome about change in the post crash era, it leaves a lot to be desired."
2,"I hate giving two stars, but...","I have to in this case, because this book was useless to me. I was expecting (Maybe I was looking at the wrong book?) a book stepping through major holds, locks, takedowns etc, but what I got instead was a situational jujitsu book that covered (badly) the basics of the system (How to handle a punch, a knife etc).Not recommended, even for beginners. There are more comprehensive books out there."
2,Weak in comparison...,"The only valuable part of this book was the list of Japanese terminology in traditional Ju Jitsu, plus a decent history section. Overall, though, the number of moves they offer is miniscule compared to other books on the market, and the pictures are so infrequent that, in a photo sequence, I often had no idea how the person got from their position in Photo 1 to their position in Photo 2. It's actually pretty funny. You'll have some guy doing something -- and, next picture, they're in an entirely different position. With the recent spate of Ju Jitsu and BJJ books, this is very outdated and I think would serve only as a broad introduction (like an extended Encyclopedia article)."
1,DVD Player not DVD Burner,I never used this item. I needed a DVD Burner and ordered a DVD player so I never used it. Just returned it unopened.
2,Write-up not clear that this is just a ROM drive,The write-up for this product does not make it clear that this is just a ROM drive. I ordered the product because I misunderstood that all the various listings were what it could read not what it could write to. I sent the thing back and had to pay the return postage. The time lost is the problem. I did order a new RW drive from Amazon.
3,"Not Bad, But...","Pretty As A Picture is an 80 minute documentary focusing on America's most original director, David Lynch. And while it was somewhat interesting in spots(the clips of his early short films were pretty neat), as a Lynchaholic, I was hoping for something a little more in depth. While it spends a lot of time talking about Lost Highway, Lynch's other films(The Elephant Man, Blue Velvet, TV's Twin Peaks) are only brushed over slightly. Wild At Heart, winner of the Palm D'Or for whoever cares, was barely mentioned if at all. For my money, I'd go with the 80 minute documentary on the Blue Velvet Special Edition DVD. Yes, it focuses mostly on Blue Velvet, but it is far more informative and interesting than Pretty As A Picture. I just think that a brilliant filmmaker like Lynch deserves a much better documentary. That's my two cents."
2,"Strangely disappointing (the movie, that is, not Lynch)","A behind the scenes look at the various products of David Lynch. Sounds interesting enough, but alas! this movie is no more than a mixture of Lynch-at-work footage, an all-too brief look at his work as a sculptor and an incomplete survey of his pictures. How is it possible that there is no mention of Lynch's absolute masterpiece 'Twin Peaks' in this documentary?? The 'Eraserhead' cast reunion is a unique display of dullness; a bunch of old actors visiting their former dwellingplaces. If you want to find out how exactly Lynch shot the prison scene in 'Lost highway' (better watch that movie again!), you have to take a look at this. However, people who know all about Lynch ànd people who know nothing at all about him, may both get disappointed. Better luck next time."
1,You Gotta Be Kidding,"*** This is not a review of the book ***I just needed to vent.Let It Ride is one of my favorite movies - I watch it a couple times a year.Maybe I'm an idiot but it's that kind of movie.I've been searching for a copy of Good Vibes for years.Many years.$160 for a used paperback copy?!Ya gotta be kiddin' me!!!Hey Cronley, I'm a huge fan of Quick Change too.(Not so much Funny Farm, but the movie wasn't your fault).Send me a dogeared copy, would ya?"
5,Highly Recommended!,"Reason for Reading: We have been using this book as part of our religion studies every school day, very slowly, for about the past year.A very simple yet thorough introduction to the Catechism and church teachings for youngsters and new Catholics of any age. Simple question and answer format takes you through 11 topics starting with ""Why Am I In the World"" and ending with ""Sin"". The final three pages present a collection of popular prayers. Very useful and easy to understand. Gave my son a good grounding in Catholic theology and we both memorized the ten commandments in order! Highly recommended."
5,Kindle Version Please,Thank you very much for publishing this book. Have recommended it to many already. Would very much appreciate a kindle version if any possible please.
1,Rewritting History,I flew the 11 Day War from Guam. As a crew dog I didn't see all the decision making logic that my leaders (ie Col McCarthey) were using. But I did experience first hand the stupidity of their WWII thinking. I got to be a sitting duck for SA-2 missiles because of the incompotence of SAC old time leaders. If you want to get the true story of the Hanoi bombings out of Guam read The 11 Days of Christmas.
5,Sad this is not available,This is an excellent reading of the classic frog and toad stories. Unfortunately arnold lobel is less than inspiring in his rendition. Ed Asner rocks Frog and Toad.
4,"Good, really not necessary","Canon pushes this fancy cartridge a lot for photo printing. It really doesn't seem to make much difference with the BJC-6000 and S450 I have, but the photos still look slightly better with it. If you don't want to spend your money on extra ink, don't buy this. The price is reasonable, and good if you print a lot of photos as the printer has more colors to pick from. Do use a good paper like the canon High Resolution Paper or the Glossy Photo Paper no matter what cartridges you use for printing photos."
4,Review of Mission Design Toy Box,"The toy box required relatively little assembly and it had clear directions. It's a nice looking, roomy box. The only reason that I didn't rate it 5 stars is because there is only one choice of finish. I would have preferred a golden oak color, rather than the lighter one."
2,Not as nice as you'd think,"From the picture this looks like it's a solid wood toy chest. Not so, the top is completely hollow and cannot support any significant weight. The only solid wood pieces are the edges and cross beams. Overall it's an OK piece of furniture for the price but don't be fooled by the picture, we were."
5,Mission Design Toy Box,"This toy box as well of the rest of the mission set from Little Tike is excellant!! The quality is superperb. All pieces are solid wood not cheap veneers...the only exception is the hollow core toy box top WHICH MAKES SENSE!!! I would not want a solid oak toy box top of that size slamming on my 6 year old, 3 year old, or 1 year old's head. There is also a divot in the top edge of all sides so than fingers don't get pinched. The top still holds all three of my children with no problem, a combined weight of 120lbs. I am very happy as well with the table and chair set and and the storage cabinet. I plan to pass these on to my grandchildren, they are commercial quality.Erin"
2,Less than advertised,"We bought this toy box because we wanted solid wood, which is what is claimed in the product description. However, the top of the box is hollow with veneer overlay (you can deflect it with you hand), and the bottom is fiberboard. Also, when you open the lid, the support struts cause the back panel to flex under the strain of the springs. There were splinters inside at the panel seams, and it arrived with a scratch on the top. I don't think it was worth the money we paid."
5,an honest review from a shocked daughter!,"i have known tom rybolt literally all my life, because he is my father. i started reading his novel to be nice and found i could soon not put it down. the suspense, the depth, the real issues...where do i start! recomend to anyone who enjoys a good novel. prepare to be captured by the words and feel the emotions of the characters! i just cant get over the fact of how much i enjoyed something my father wrote!"
4,Insights for Still-Life Painters,"As a painter of still-life, I purchased the book for obvious reasons. The text is for a more academic audience; this is not a light read. Some familiarity with post-modern analysis is helpful. Fortunately the writing is not too dense. As an artist I was able to gain some insights into how some intellectuals would interpret my own work and to a lesser extent made me aware of some of my own unchallenged assumptions."
1,This CD is totally not for me,Most of the sound effects are not good....not as the title decribed. I feel that I waste my money.
3,Nice bag for road warriors. Durable and Roomy but Handle Has Problems,"I bought this roller laptop case three years ago and it just died on me this year. This is a nice bag for road warriors who travel frequently, especially if you have overnight business trips. The drawback is the cheap handle. I had to carry a tiny screwdriver around with me because after about six months of use, the screw kept coming out! Eventually, the pushbutton handle starting 'sticking' as well and after having gotten stuck in the 'up' position several times, it's now stuck for good. All in all, it's not a bad bag at all though; the maker just needs to put more quality and thought into the handle."
4,better than stores,original oem cartridges last longer but unfortunately are pricier. this is the best price I could find for canon color inkjet cartridges.
4,Clear Light Review,This came in great shape and was very well-packaged. The sound is good for a 60's recording and the content if very impressive as well. I'm fully satisfied.
5,Paul Rothchild's Frankenstein Project Rules,"Clear Light may be dismissed by some as a ""Doors Lite"" band, but I think the material and playing on this CD is outstanding. I was hooked as soon as I heard ""Black Roses"" with it's amazing time signature changes, played at a breathtaking hardcore punk pace (before the beast ever existed).Some tracks have the definite Doors-Love sound without the drunken tunelessness of Jim Morrison, so you get movie actor Cliff De Young's great vocals instead. ""Mister Blue"" even has that ""petition the Lord with prayer"" dramatics with 100 times more focus.Favorite tracks: She's Ready To be Free, Sand, The Ballad of Freddy and Larry (about gay love?). Recommended."
1,Devil dog,This movie was very poorly made. I took it straight to the trash. I just didn't like the move at all.
2,A Devil of a Woofer!,"Mediocre acting, minimal direction, and a miniscule budget have borne a typical mutt of a horror movie. Unlike most modern creature features, however, this one takes itself so seriously that the improbable situations and blindly risky behavior make for a melodrama with undertones of comic absurdity. The cinematography--and often the subject matter--resemble a home video of a family vacation. Sets range from a residential pool that looks like a mini water park to a spartan, Ed-Woodsian hospital suite more reminiscent of a mechanic shop waiting room. There's a sex foreplay scene with the paunchy lead seductively peeling off his shirt and canine-kill scenes where the victims look like they succumbed to paint-ball attacks. The pacing is as lazy as a hound on a hot afternoon, but the viewer who can doggedly endure this dud will at least be rewarded with a howl or two of laughter."
3,Repackaging of old Veggie material,"If you own other Veggie Tales titles, be sure to note that this includes mainly previously released material:""The Story of Flibber-O-Loo,"" ""Duke and the Great Pie War,"" and ""Madame Blueberry."" It's organized around a nice theme if you don't already own these titles: loving your neighbor, your family, and God. But don't miss the passing reference in the description to ""classic stories"" (translation: re-releases) and think this is brand-new material."
4,A Journey through Academia,"Dr. Bloomfield, Founder and Dean of a new and innovative medical school at the University of Illinois, describes the challenges and frustrations of creativity within a bureaucratic state system. His description of the hurdles he had to leap, and especially the lack of support (primarily financial) offered to him, would make most people cave in. Balanced with these frustrations is the extraordinary success he was able to achieve. It is a credit to him and to his colleagues that so much was accomplished. And that is what makes the story bearable. I would encourage university administrators and those interested in innovative approaches to medical (and other professional) disciplines to read this book."
5,Lots of fun for a very reasonable price!,"If you're a fan of Mad Libs, the hilarious word game that produces the craziest stories in the world, and you're also a fan of Nancy Drew, this new game will be your dream come true!Just fill in the blanks as the reader calls out -- nouns, verbs, name of a person in the room, etc. A great feature of this game is that there is also a way for you to play it by yourself. So, Nancy Drew Mad Libs is a wonderful game to have at home on a rainy day.Great to play in the car, at sleepovers or just with the family, participants will find that they have produced a story about Nancy and her regular crew of friends -- saying and doing things in a way that would really surprise Carolyn Keene!"
3,Good content - but over priced,"This DVD was very informative for the beginner with very clear instruction and proper technique. However, we were disappointed that it only covered upper body weightlifting, and not lower body. Therefore, we feel the DVD was overpriced for what you get."
1,Lacking in rigor and having nothing to do with reality!,"This is a poorly thought and purposeless book. A modeler will find it to be a mumbo jumbo collection of elementary mathematical techniques not related to each other in a meaningful manner. On the other hand, a practitioner epidemiologist will find that the models presented in the book are merely a selection of toy examples having nothing to do with reality. Given the above, the price of the book is unreasonably high. If the book did not include several mathematical inaccuracies (solution existence conditions, asymptotics etc.), one could possibly use some of its model-examples in an introductory course of mathematical modeling, but unfortunately this is not the case here. Notice that there is a plethora of other books that are appropriate for this task and much-much cheaper."
3,"Liked it, but. . .","the heroine's family chose not to be entered on the 'official' list of the tribe, but it seems that when she can get any advantage from being considered Native American, she will take it. Can you say 'having it both ways', boys and girls? Sure you can.The mystery was interesting; I don't know enough about Osage and Western Cherokee folkways to know how accurately they are depicted (my Cherokee contacts are with the Eastern Band in NC).Although I enjoyed the book, it don't feel a burning need to read it again."
1,"Muddled, contradictory novel, frequently racist","There's an explosion. Then the bad guy tells an insurance company that the explosion was caused by Native Americans, who had been sending him threats. The insurance company hires a PI to find out if the bad guy had indeed been receiving threats; if he had, then his insurance claims go bye-bye. That's right: they hire her to prove he'd received threats, WHEN HE HIMSELF HAD BEEN CLAIMING TO HAVE RECEIVED THREATS.Add to this moronic, ill-conceived plot a number of white, middle-class platitudes about the way Native Americans have no right to their anger or to tribal justice, and you have a nauseating, self-righteous, obnoxious, idiotic, racist little pile of scrap."
5,The best CD I bought this year,You will not go wrong in buying this CD. Track 13 (Angel) is my favorite song.
5,Words simply don't say enough...,"Some things have a such a way of coming into our lives or how things work out for us... And for me, this CD is one of them. If it were not for Zeocast, I may have completely missed the opportunity to hear John Stoddart singing ""ANYTHING"". His voice and the words to this song are incredibly powerful! Fortunately I found the link to Amazon to review and buy the CD from. This is so unlike me (I rarely have the time, or the opportunity to buy CD's), but I just had to have this CD!Just as our eyes are ""the windows to our soul"" this music is much more!Simply put, there are really no words that can best describe well enough how absolutely OUTSTANDING the entire CD truly is! Listening to the words, the music, and the feeling heard through John's incredible voice, is truly not only a spiritual experience, but heavenly to the ears and to the heart to all that hear it!"
2,Unreliable,"I have owned this stud finder for 6 years and have used it only about a dozen times. The signals are very unreliable, you need to use other sources to find the right location. Those include knocking on wall, using the magnetic stud finder, when it works, also just trial an error with nails.. So as you can see this thing has been very frustrating. You have to spend a long time playing with it and mapping and entire wall for you to figure out if there is a stud there. I am going to buy the I520 to see if i have better luck with that. I am figuring its been about 7 yrs, the technology has to be better now.."
1,Zircon Marketing Department Rating Their Own Products?,I'm conducting research on stud finders and found the Zircon models highly rated. The ratings are skewed by the manufacturer! Zircon's Marketing Director has rated each of their prodcuts as a 5 in an effort to boost their ratings. I'm not buying from this company SOLEY for this reason - I fully intened to purchase a top-of-the-line Triscanner. As a Marketing VP I thought I had seen everything. Very unfortunate to see this.
2,Never very accurate.,"I have owned a few stud finders and this particular one has been the worst. I am no big contractor but just a simple do it yourselfer. My cheap old vanilla Stanley (stud finder) and my magnet have been my best bets. I got this because of the extra bells and whistles. Well, those bells and whistles ring a ding ding and sing and holler but they don't mean nothing.I gave it two stars just because if you have this in your bag it is definitely better than nothing at all."
3,just picture Lemmy singing rockabilly,"Motorhead's Lemmy Kilmister teams up with Stay Cat's Slim Jim Phantom for a rockabilly side-project. Um, just picture Lemmy singing rockabilly, and that pretty much sums it up. I thought it was going to be disastrous, but it was actually quite surprising and good. You're grandfather might not like it, but it's cool to hear a different and softer side of Lemmy."
3,Solid but that's about it,"It's a nice little album, but Lemmy is way out of his element trying to sing and perform rockabilly songs. The drum work of Slim Jim is what makes this album worth getting"
1,Unclean,"OXO has great products. They sent me the wrong one when I ordered this one and than Amazon sends me a picture of the item I actually ordered and asked how I liked it. I would have liked it, if I had not been sent the wrong item! The product gets 5 stars based upon my previous purchases of it. Wish I had the one I ordered so I had not run out of them!"
5,Excellent resource for working as a professional with children,I have been using this in my therapy practice and have found it very resourceful. It has wonderful suggestions for the therapist to untilize in assisting children to express and resolve their issues when in situations they are unable to resolve through the expressions of words. They can express through play and in cognitve ways and it works!!!
2,Very basic intro to play therapy,"Although I have only had 5 years of experience in play therapy with elementary-age children, I felt that the techniques described in this book were basic and not very imaginative- in other words, I had already thought of many of them myself. Several of the techniques described are similar variations on the same theme; for example, the assigning colors to emotions and having kids color in hearts/bodies/etc. strategy was echoed numerous times. I suggest borrowing this from the library rather than purchasing it."
3,just okay,"Definately not as good as the other volumes. Techniques aren't as interesting and kid friendly. If you are trying to choose, go for volume 2."
4,Great piece of Furniture,"This easel is a sturdy piece of furniture. It does not fold down, so not good for small spaces. The tray on the white-board side isn't wide enough for the paint cups we bought and that is the only mark against it.2012 update: This easel is still in great condition. Our daughter still uses it often. Love this!"
5,Great for toddlers,"Bought this for my daughter's 2nd birthday. It is a great fit for her size and age. Additionally, it shipped quickly and was easy for one person to assemble.I do wish it came with chalk and erasers. Thankfully we happened to have some on hand."
4,Costly but worth the extra money,"We bought this easel for our daughter's 2nd birthday. She loves it and so do we. First of all, it's beautiful and compliments any room. There are some easels out there that you wouldn't want in your living room or den.This easel is built to last. It will be with your family for years and years. It's safe and strong. It can not be tipped over by a child.The side trays are nicely attached and will never fall off like they do on cheaper easels. It's also great because two children can use it at the same time.The only thing that I can say about improving the item.. is to include some markers, chalk and an eraser. For the money, it should come with some supplies.Yes, this easel is a little more expensive (especially when you have to pay for the shipping) but well worth it!!"
4,This book was great!!,"I thought the book started a little slow but once a settled in and read it, it only took me one night. I just loved the twist in the book. Sometimes, we really don't realize how good we have it until it is too late. Hold on to your good man ladies."
5,OOhh How I Relate!!,"Anika I just want to say to you, you have summed my whole life up in a nutshell. And if that is how my life will end, then girl I want to say thank you for showing me the way. I should change my name to Lisa and my fiance's to Darnell. I bought your book, and I loved it. It has so many twists and turns, just like life. And you know which character I loved the most- Andre. He is like the best friend that every woman needs, and funny as hell. Good luck on your next novel and I definitely will run to pick it up."
3,"Get a proofreader, please!","This could have been a better book if the author had someone proofread and check her grammar, punctuation and spelling."
1,10 Minutes Past Terrible,"These reviewers must be the authors family and friends or herself because this is one TERRIBLE book! First of all it's OVERPRICED! Its written at a 7th grade level. How dare she insult adult readers intelligence. WARNING: This book is awful. The story is awful and boring. I want my money back. Ms. Malone, don't quit your day job cause writing ain't in your future."
2,Not best for confidentiality,"Strip-cut shredding is not recommended for applications where true confidentiality is desired. A cross-cut shredder, on the other hand, produces large confetti-type paper bits that cannot be puzzle-pieced back together. It would seem to be the better choice. This shredder is heavy-duty, which is a good thing, but strip-cutting does not ensure nearly the degree of confidentiality in your destroyed papers as does cross-cutting, and for that reason yopu might want to avoid this shredder in favor of an equally heavy-duty cross-cutting one."
1,simular wrench from Home Depot,"I can't agree more with the author of a previous review. I bought the same type wrench, not a rubber one but with thick waxed cloth hoping it will be finish safe to work on shower head installation. After 20 min of pain I have to get a real wrench too. Good idea but unforunately doesn't work in real life."
4,Good Substitute for rubber gloves,"Essentially this product utilizes the fact that rubber materials have good friction and help you open jar-lids and the like that are stuck on. For years I have been using simple dish washing rubber gloves to achieve the same results, but this product's clever design with a handle, which adds additional leverage, is very useful. I would recommend it. I would have given it a 5-star, if only they had added a locking mechanism to hold the strap in place --- you will have to hold it in place with your own fingers now.The merchant had two or three similar products, and had shipped me a wrong one. When I complained, they were willing to either accept a return or give a discount, which was nice of them (though the responses were not that prompt, and I had to persevere --- another reason for the 4-stars)."
5,Great little grippers,"I bought this pair for my neighbor for a Christmas present. I've had mine for years and would have a tough time living without it. Whenever she couldn't get a lid off and her husband wasn't available, she would call and ask if she could use my lid gripper. Everyone should have one."
3,Not worth it. . .,"This book started out with good intentions but didn't cut it. First off, the book was supposed to be told from both sides of the story (the husband and the wife), in first person, but I felt like the only person you really heard from was the husband. Some of the circumstances that occurred I would have preferred a different turn of events, but that's just me. The author tried to make the story as historically accurate as possible, but it was just unrealistic. The racism the characters faced wasn't quite realistic enough, the author just touched the surface. Lastly, some parts were just plain old boring (romance readers beware: this is not a romantic novel!)."
4,Alter Ego,"Donna Mackenzie was a powerful television journalist who'd built a career exposing the saints and sinners of the world. Off camera, however, no one would recognize Kenzie Heydon, the woman behind the image. Sexy Alaric Rogan met and charmed the real woman, not her savvy, sophisticated alter ego. And Kenzie fell deeply in love. But it was a cold, calculated setup- a plan of revenge against Donna Mackensie for the suffering one of her ""interviews"" had inflicted upon his family. And now Alaric had Kenzie exactly where he wanted her...."
2,"Extremely short, disappointing, and intellectually insulting","While I realize that this DVD is IMAX and therefore intended for broad audiences who may or may not be familiar with scientific terminology, I do feel this offering has been too dumbed down to be enjoyable for adults. I would recommend it for an elementary or junior high school class-- maybe even an introduction to astronomy class, but for someone who wants to see space, this is not the DVD to buy. ""Cosmic Voyage"" is a misleading title, as there is very little space to be seen and far too much on-the-ground footage. Equally appalling is the 36 minute duration of the video. This is far too short a time in which to adequately cover all the concepts the back of the DVD box promises. All in all, I was bored and frustrated at the amount of money paid for something so short and unimpressive."
5,COSMIC VOYAGE,"A great experience for all ages. Beautifully done. Essential for the young and old alike. If a picture is worth a thousand words, this is orders of magnitude more."
5,Cosmic voyage,"Many years ago I watched a very similar film during an IBM event. During this time I always wanted to have a copy of it. Recently I looked for such a film in Amazon and... I found this one, which is better than the initial!It is really a super excellent video."
2,"This movie didn't quite make it, I'd recommand something else...","This movie does give viewers a general idea of the universe, in a very conservative sense. It only contains material and topics based on traditional big bang theory. Personally, I disagree with alot of ideas presented in the movie. I think since this movie is relatively new (2002) and not created back in the 70's or 80's, it should atleast contain new discoverys and new theories such as Super String Theory. Therefore, I do not recommand this movie if you are seeking to learn new knowledge, as far as I can tell, the movie is based on stuff we knew back in the 80's. However, I would definitely recommand the following: (1)The Elegant Universe (by NOVA,PBS) and (2)Origins (by NOVA,PBS) Both are very very good!!"
1,"Okay, but too much evolution","The main part of the video is good, but unfortunately they included so many references to evolution and other theories. Why can't it just give credit to the Creator? That would make so much more sense..."
5,Buy it!,"Bayley Silleck's work is always extremely powerful especially in the the IMAX medium. Here he take elements of ""Powers of Ten"" and gives it a new up to date spin. Simply awe-inspiring. Its best to see in an OMNIMAX or IMAX theater but the DVD will do if you just cant see it at your local IMAX Theater. Most pleasing is also the delivery of Morgan Freeman' narration mixed with the beautiful score."
3,Good for Children,"I was a little disapointed in this DVD. The photography/animation was OK, but not great. The circles got annoying very quickly. The information on this disc seemed somewhat dated and rather dumbed-down. There's nothing here you won't find on PBS or elsewhere, and I really cannot imagine anyone learning anything new from this. Watching this disc was like eating a rice cake-it really didn't take care of my cravings. I do recomend this disc for young children, since they may benefit from it.I much prefered Stargaze-Pictures from the Hubble Telescope, for the superb photography alone."
2,"Pop-tart science, very dissapointing",Fails to engage the imagination and has VERY little to offer in terms of physics or otherwise. Two stars go to Morgan Freeman's soothing narrative. Try the BBC's 'Universe' & 'Planets' for good quality marco-stuff. Micro topics just round the corner hopefully.
1,Don't buy this version,"I saw Cosmic Voyage on cable and it was awesome in high def. I received my ordered copy and the IMAX version was not in high def, in fact the quality of the DVD was so poor that I thought maybe this was a counterfitted copy. I did not enjoy it at all and this worthless DVD went to the trash. I think that it was unfair not to disclose the fact that the DVD was not in high def."
2,Big Disapointment,"Anyone expecting a ""Cosmos"" type of voyage, like I did, is going to be sadly disapointed. The actual voyage thru the universe is only about 5 minutes in length, and compared to the fantastic visuals in the movie ""Cosmos"" is like a Saturday morning cartoon."
1,Everybody Has Different Taste in Music but----,"I don't know who rated these as favorites but I think only about 20 would be counted in my top 200. Bunch of Marches I can't stand, None or Very Little from the Romantic Periods. Have two granddaughters that play in School Orchestras and wanted to get them something to listen to ranter than the Pop Crap but This Crap album has little of the pieces with strong beautiful melodies and no romance. Sent it to the thrift store"
4,A Really Good Tragedy!,A free spirited girl marries the wrong man and that leads to scandal and then murder. This is an intense drama of a true story.
4,Tragic,Well done adaptation of a tragic true story but the ending is too rushed. Should have filmed trial scenes and more pre-execution confinement in order to correctly portray the travesty that Edith Thompson endured.
1,Serious waste of money,"I purchased the OEM/Heavy duty oil and gas filter to remove a stuck oil filter from my Mazda Miata after having the product recommended to me by one of the employees at my local AutoZone. Upon returning home with the product eager to finish with my oil change I was soon dissappointed to discover that it was all but impossible to make the wrench grip the filter. When I finally managed to get a grip on the filter, the wrench simply flexed from the smallest amount of torque. Dejected, I returned to AutoZone seeking a refund on my purchase only to be informed that one of the spot welds had broken, causing the wrench to bend and that I couldn't get a refund! Contacted the manufacture about the problem and haven't heard back from them since. Do yourself a favor and spend the money you would waste on these for some adjustable filter pliers. I picked up a cheap set from Harbor Freight after my failure with this wrnech and had the stuck filter loose within 3 seconds!"
2,Didn't Work,Tool would not grip which is what it is supposed to do. It's cheap. You get what you pay for.
5,If I had to choose one book on gangs this is it!,"Outstanding!! I have read several text on gangs in my 18 years of law enforcement experience, this one is the best one yet. The book is not only informative but easy to follow and entertaining as well. Mr. Valdez covers the history and main identifiers of basically every major gang in this country. If you know nothing about gangs, this is an excellent book for a beginner. If you thank you know all there is to know about gangs, read this book and learn how much more there is to know."
4,street gangs,"i want to know who wrote this book and the publisher,copy right company and every information i can find about this book."
2,Good intentions but bad result,"The intentions of this book are good: fathers should find time for being with their children, however the book in itself it is not interesting: it just says a lot of trivialities. Each chapter is about an impotant subject, like pregnancy and birth, but then just few pages are spent on it and as a consequence it remains very superficial."
1,Beware Swing-Aways Made in China,"Since 2008, models 107, 407, 709 and 6090 appear to be made in China and are inferior to the original which had ""Made in USA"" stamped on the metal arm."
1,amco can opener,they sent me not real one it was on the internet made in usa but they sent me for second time chineese made.
2,Pretty good but rusty!,"I have a 'Made in USA' version of this. It works pretty well, but it became super rusty, especially on the blade. My other OXO good grip at least doesn't rust on the blade but the plastic handles keep pulling out. :(I'm looking for something that's rust-free and plastic-free."
1,Poorly made,"Very poorly made. First time out of the package, and the rubber grips on the handles came off. The actual gear and blade are mis-aligned so that, every every other twist or so of the handle, the handle and the gear disengage, and the blade stops moving. Used it on ten cans and it opened none of them smoothly. Immediately sent back to the store."
1,No Longer Made in USA - Poor Quality,"Swing-A-Way can openers are no longer made in the USA and the quality shows. We bought one to replace the previous model that had lasted over 15 years. It was obvious from day one it wouldn't last more than a year. It was ""stripping"" cans within two weeks. We packed it up and sent it back to where it came from and got our money back.Very dissapointing to see another quality American-Made product destroyed by the China Syndrome."
5,Best can opener EVER,"Pros: best can opener, i ever used. Most plastic ones feel flimzy and keep breaking on me. They dull up too quick and spin out when excessive force is required. This simple looking can opener is best for what it does.Cons: you still don't have one"
1,China Junk!!! Dont buy!,Opened the package today to be very dissented. This is not made in USA this is made in China!!! Dont purchase this item! It will rust in 1 wash with the inferior metals the Chinese use.
1,don't waste your money,"This is the worst can opener ever, leaves multiple sites uncut around can, and it has only been used three times since I purchased it one month ago. It is going in the trash can."
3,Handle grips fall off,"The white handle grips slip off easily! Smooth operation, but rusts easily! Not 5 star by any means - come on really this is not a perfect can opener. Anything made in China is just plain cheap anyhow."
1,Horrible - go for EZ-DUZ-IT instead,Do you want the original? Go look at the EZ-DUZ-IT can opener (made in USA too). Wish there was some way I could send this review across ALL the cheap Chinese-made versions
5,It is the best,Some companies just make the best of a given item. Swing-Away makes the best hand held can opener. I paid $6 for mine at least 15 years ago. It works like a charm. This will be the last can opener you buy for a long time unless you lose it. Or unless you buy one as a gift.
1,No longer made in AMERICA!,Shame on Amazon for not reporting in the description that the SWING-A-Way can opener is now made in China. I would NEVER have ordered it if it was listed in the description as they have always been made here in the USA and stamped as such. What arrived in the mail today is nothing like my old ones and I am not happy about it at all.
3,Not made in the USA,"I ordered this can opener because I had used one previously, and it was made in the USA. I was so disappointed to turn the packaging over and see that this was made in china."
1,"Terrible, does not last","I'm baffled by all the positive reviews about this can opener. I have only had mine for a couple of years and it has gotten to the point where it will barely open a can anymore. I was looking on amazon to buy a new one, and I came across this one again. I was so surprised by the rating, particularly because this is what I am trying to replace, that I had to write a review. Perhaps maybe I just have a defective one? I'm not sure what the case is, but the can opener that I have has not withstood the test of time."
1,This item is not made in the USA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I ordered this item because my last made in the USA can opener that I had owned for the past 20 years was stolen by my former room mates. I looked in the stores for another swing a way can opener and there were none to be found, only dozens of made in China crap. I ordered this one thinking I was getting another American made piece of craftsmanship, and what I just received in the mail was another made in China hunk of junk.I wasn't going to make a big deal out of it, and went to use it to open a can of tuna, and ended up putting it back in the drawer and getting out my leatherman multi-tool to open the can with.Don't waste your money buying this piece of crap, you will be better off getting a hammer and chisel and pounding the can open."
2,NOT BUILT LIKE THE ORIGINAL,This one is made in china and its crap! I found a website a year ago [...] that has a can opener which is called EZ-DUZ-IT and its made in usa. Ive been using this EZ-DUZ-IT can opener and its built like a tank.
1,Don't buy ! Just went to China !,"I bought two of these a year or so ago ! They were made in the USA. I bought them at K Mart. I just drove 25 miles so that I could get something made in the US again. This company has since moved production to China !Don't buy ! They care more about increasing their profits, then they care about America or YOU !"
1,"rust, Rust, RUST",This opener rusted after the first wash in the dishwasher -- the blade and gear are disgustingly full of rust. I DO NOT recommend this can opener at all. It is the only opener I have that rusted... really bad.
1,Not quite as useful as a rock for opening cans.,"It takes three hands to open a can with a Swing-Away can opener. One hand to hold the grip, a second hand to turn the crank, and a third hand to hold the can. This is because the cutting wheel will walk over the rim of the can allowing the can to drop away from the can opener. This might be annoying if you are opening a can of something you can pour out of the can easily, but if you are opening something like chilled cranberry sauce or refried beans, which requires removing both ends of the can and allowing the contents to slide out in a cylindrical shape, this can opener is going to dump the can into the bowl, pot, or whatever food dish you are working over. In a restaurant, that means you dispose of the contaminated pot full of food and start over. So, unless you have three hands, or desire a can opener that requires two people to use, then this particular piece of equipment is not for you."
1,Lasted less than a year!!!,"I bought one of these after the old one I had that was a hand-me-down from mymom finally wore out. lasted and worked fine for well over 3 decades,never having met a can it couldn't open!Then one day it just gave out, the cutter blade was worn out and I couldn't figure outhow to sharpen it so I bought a new one.The new ones are made in Communist China and the quality shows!!!These things are made with very soft metal that has no strength or endurance.After just a few months it wouldn't cut through the lid on things like Star Kist tunaor Progresso soup cans!! It seems to ride up the side of the lid instead of cutting through.I end up having to pry up the lid with a screwdriver to shake out the contents!I just read a review and the guy said he finds the good old USA ones in second hand stores.Sometime this week I will be passing by a thrift store and intend to go in and see if I canlocate one for myself!"
1,made in china - junk,Swing-away moved mfg to china and it doesn't work near as well as a US made model which I had before. It doesn't cut the can lids cleanly except to make parts sharp as a razor. Terrible.
4,"NOT original recordings, but still a great record","Just want to emphasize the point that these are not the exact recordings from the original albums. They are the same arrangements, but they are noticeably different.I like them a lot personally, but I had to get past the initial expectation that they were original recordings. This should be made much clearer."
5,the way things were,"do you ever wonder about the old days? how people thought about space and time, and oh yes, giant monster bugs? then look no further than this fine and funny volume. from 1950 to 1962, warren covers the best to the worst with a wry sense of humor and a clear love for the subject. almost everything is covered, from obscure jungle movies, to elaborate space epics. if you want to know about these old films, and have a laugh or two, then by all means pick up this book."
3,"Entertaining reading, sometimes too casual and critical","As a serious film researcher, I often seek out encyclopedias and directories where I might interview the stars of the great B ones. Often the facts behind a film's production are even more entertaining than speculation or opinions. Here is Warren's main flaw. Recapsuling McFarland Book stalwarts like Tom Weaver and his interviews can be interesting only so many times. Also, he often loads criticisms in his synopsis that nit pick details which aren't really flaws ie. Who cares if the crowd is seen running a different direction in one shot after the 50 foot woman is seen in the next one? The fun people had watching the film is lost when he leads us through the forest to count the trees. It also is difficult to find a film when Volume One ends at 1957 so you have to keep searching the pages for films made close to 1960."
4,"Okay, okay, I agree with the praise. BUT...","Unquestionably researched, undeniably well-thought out, unsurpassed in scope, and intelligently written.Yet I think Mr. Warren is a little too harsh with many of the movies and people he speaks of, especially those in Volume 2. It's like kicking a diseased puppy to heap criticism on a movie like Invisible Invaders or The Astounding She-Monster. I mean, come on! He sees the camp appeal of Cat-Women of the Moon, but not of The Hideous Sun Demon? It seems like an apples to apples comparison to me.Aw, well, to each his own. No two people will agree on everything.Although Mr. Warren does come off as downright curmudgeonly quite often, I forgive him. He must be cut considerable slack for being man enough to admit in print to the rare charms of Yvette Vickers."
5,A wonderful book,"I love this book. I've checked it out of the local library countless times in the last 10 years. He literally examines every known SF film from 1950-1962, both the classics and the (often for the better) forgotten, and has something intelligent and interesting to say about all of them. I grew up with these films too, and it really brought back memories for me. It also has added appreciation for these films, even the truly awful ones, when I view them today. Thanks to Bill Warren I know I'm not the only one who had a special place in his heart for movies like ""The Day the World Ended"""
3,"Kind of boring, but good information","Linda Seger teaches or taught script writing at some school somewhere. She loves to tell you this in her book. I don't think she actually ever wrote any movies in her life that I can tell. According to the Internet Movie Database she was listed under Miscellaneous Crew in the ""Never Ending Story II: The Next Chapter"". Not exactly a block buster. So I think she should work a little harder on her craft. My guess is that she has made more money teaching and writing about movies than actually writing a movie. She is listed as script consultant in some random movies I've never heard of. Probably worth the $3 I paid used but not much more. Here's a tip for the author. Go write a movie we've heard of and then write a book."
2,Puffed up piece of...,"I bought this book because it was required for a course I was taking on screenwriting. By about the fourth chapter I had found at least 5 blatant spelling/grammar errors. Everyone makes errors, yes, but it's hard to take a writer who is giving advice seriously when she can't even get her books edited correctly.This wasn't the only problem with the book, which seemed at times to exist to kiss up to other screenwriters. Linda used examples to illustrate her points, but her views were too narrow. Witness might have been a good movie, but did it deserve over two chapters of commentary and worship? I think not."
1,"Already Way, Way Beyond It","As a beginning screenwriting student I picked up this book expecting to find, not a miracle, but some good tips. Instead I found the content to be so elementary that even I, a beginning student, am way, way beyond everything the book presents. I also thought the contents were ""preachy"" and detracted from the overall presentation of the material. To me, at least, this is an old fashioned book and really won't help anyone in the highly competitive market of today's modern screenplays. END"
2,"How to Make Your Unique Script Look Like ""Witness""","... is more an appropriate title of the book.While the book necessarily reiterates the important aspect of structured screenwriting, it really offers very little else. It's a book for beginners and just retreads all the cliches. Be careful. Your unique script might end up looking like a TV Movie of the Week teleplay.And the section on ""How to Make Your Script Commercial"" really made one wonder about the observation of the author. Does she really think that high box-office movies really depend on structure?"
5,I recommend it to all!,"I sponsor an annual screenplay writing competition and read several hundred scripts a year - I recommend this book to everyone who enters. My copy is dog-eared, highlighted, and yellow-tabby flagged. There are few equals or superior alternatives."
5,EXCELLENT,"I AM A SCREENWRITER AND I TEACH SCREENWRITING. SEGER'S BOOK HAS PROOVED AN INDESPENSIBLE TOOL. I SINCERELY RECOMMEND ""MAKING A GOOD SCRIPT GREAT"" TO ANYONE INTERESTED IN THE SUBJECT."
5,Linda Seger's bible to be a great script writer and more great stories,"Linda Seger is best at what she does as a script consultant and I recommend to all those who want to make their scripts viable, producible and or noticeable. She gives you the do's and don'ts of redoing your script. Highly, Highly, Highly recommended."
3,Some useful stuff,"As an actor and playwright, I found much of what Linda Seger wrote to be useful. It's actually the sort of thing I wish that I had available when I started. I can only give it three stars as it does not quite adequately enough address the needs of the experienced script writer. It's, nonetheless, good, and I don't quite understand the suspicious negative postings on this page. After all, it is well-enough written, and objective, and Ms. Seger's credentials seem to be good."
1,OUTDATED,"Seger's ""how to"" book might have been okay for the scripts of twenty years ago (when it was originally published) but it offers no practical advice for today's modern screenwriter. The more recent editions contain nothing new and no updated information."
1,Not comprehensive enough,"I found the content of this book too skimpy to really be a help. The formula it presented is too simplified to be applied universally to all screenplays. Yes, screenwriting is basic, but not all screenplays are equal and I think it is wrong to try to sqeeze all screenplays into a mold."
5,One of the Best,This is one of the best books on craft out there. Read it and remember it writing your next draft.
3,"I like it, but itis a little boring for me.","It is noce to see all these scales, but i should have focused more in dpth on certain scale or styles."
5,Sturdy,Surprisingly sturdy and very nice looking piece. Just big enough to fit in the space underneath our flat screen TV.
1,??????????,Does this item even exist?????? I have been checking periodically since November 2001 and have yet to see it in stock.
4,will it work?,Does anyone know if this controler will work with sega bass fishing duel for playstaton 2?
1,"Not ""Carpet""","These are pretty thin - I was surprized when I picked up the box and it was so light, now I know why. And the material is definitely NOT carpet - It's a non-woven felt-type gray-something - more like fabric and not as heavy as canvas. The teeth are tiny and the mats slip around on the floor with every move your feet make, plus with a slippery applique it's definitely not worth 24-bucks. I've gotten better for $10 ~!~"
3,nothing special,A bit disappointing...looks and feels like felt...I'm sure they won't last long...but they match the seat covers so I chose to keep them.
1,Sundamaged.,"So, they were not the right size, but that was easily delt with, as I have a Kia Spectra with pegs to hold the mats in place. Yes, the decal is a bit slippery when getting into the car- especially if you have wet shoes already. But the most disappointing thing? These must have been on display in the sun- the decal which is clearly shown as a darker blue or a purple (the stitching accompanying mine is purple) and so the colors are severely faded. They could have at least noted this in all honesty then marked the price down. I'm quite dissatisfied and may stick to only buying steering wheel covers from this brand. (and not this vendor, which was not Amazon.com --edited)"
1,disappointed,we were vaery dissapointed to recieve these floor mats and see the fairy was dressed in blue not purple like on the seat covers we ordered at the same time. did not like the blue color at all.
1,They keep sending defective items.,When I received my order the glass surface of the termometer was scratched and it made it hard to read the numbers.I went thru all the hassle return it to Amazon. Amazon sent me new one. Guess what? Second one (the replacement) was scratched in the same way.They are sending defective items.
4,~GOOD ENOUGH~,"After looking at so many Thermometers I decided to get this one, CDN Proaccurate Insta Read Beverage and Frothing Thermometer not for Frothing Milk only to heat it up to make Yogurt. I have used it about 10 Times so far and works without any problems. I have to reach the Temperature indicated and it might be off by a couple of degrees. It has the Recalibration Tool on the Sheath. I like the fact that can be attached very secured to the Pot with Milk and the Clip works Perfectly, stays there without moving. My Thermometer came without any Scratches on the Glass Surface and arrived very fast, It's not Perfect but so far still works! ...Thank You"
2,Not accurate after one month,"Bought one month ago, used for 2 weeks, was out of town for 3 weeks.It now displays 180F for boiling water."
4,Good Product,Works exactly as I wanted it to. The highlighted field makes hitting your target a breeze. Improved my coffee making instantly.
5,Yogurt Making Made Easy,"I ordered this for yogurt making, and it's perfect! I calibrated the thermometer with the standard boil test, and it was only off by one degree, which I felt was totally within reasonable error. Though if you're really concerned about it, it comes with a calibration tool (its the black tube in the product picture). The thermometer seems pretty accurate and really allows me to control the milk boil/simmer for yogurt. The clip is really handy and works really well, keeping the thermometer in place. I imagine this would be great for frothing milk for lattes and cappuccinos, but the stem might be a little long. If you're looking for a beverage thermometer, you might check out something like this:CDN IRB220-F ProAccurate Insta-Read NSF Beverage & Frothing Thermometer. It has a shorter stem."
5,As good as it gets.,"Plain and simple, this album has the best beats, the best rhymes, the best album cover, and the best focus of any Lif albums to date. I feel in a way that having heard this album first, sort of spoiled his other albums for me with the exception of I Phantom, mearly for the fact that the DJ got real dull on the other albums in comparison to this.I'm rambling; get it!"
4,Classic,This EP is relevant whether you heard in 2001 or listened for the the first time in 2010. Mr. Lif always comes correct.
2,Slippery Handle,"I don't like how my hand always slides when I'm holding the handle. Also, when you're trying to scoop really hard ice-cream, it still doesn't work very well."
2,Don't run it through the dishwasher,"Scoops ice cream as advertsed, though I did not detect much magic from the antifreeze said to be coursing through it.A beautiful, lustrous finish was ruined by one trip through the dishwasher -- now it is a sort of zinc grey. 4[stars}...s had it retained its finish."
3,Does what it says but...,"I have to say that I like this product for the usefulness of it and the ease with which it does scoop ice cream. Unfortunately, we learned the hard way that putting it through the dishwasher will cause corrosion on the metal surface. This will also happen if you leave it in water (in the sink) for a period of time. Basically, if you plan on using this scoop (which does work well), make sure to clean it within a short period of time."
3,Too Pricey,"This ice cream scoop works really well the way it melts through ice cream, but the price is too high. The Pampered Chef sells them for a lot cheaper."
5,Pure drop,"I saw these guys in person at an Irish Festival near Cincinnati and if the performance tent had doors, they would have blown them off. The energy that poured from these musicians was incredible and the crowd was fired up.So I bought their ""Give Us A Penny and Let Us Be Gone"" CD at the festival and heard a totally different side of the group. At first I was disapppointed - there is much less of the raw energy that they showed in performance. But that was only at first. It didn't take me long to realize that they really know the music, they grok it, and they are masters of their axes. The result is a product that is polished and technically masterful and still has the edge of a performance at a real Irish pub.I've since bought the self-titled CD and they both are in heavy rotation. I'll be buying their latest CD ""Inné Amárach"" soon. If you like straight up ""pure drop"" IrTrad music and you don't have this disc yet, get it. 'Nuff said."
3,functional product at quality price,"This mid/low grade filter is just that. It is functional and efficient. The install can be a bit cumbersome due the the flimsy tab recievers at the ends, they don't always catch and hold correctly on the corresponding tabs. Amazon's price will generally beat auto parts stores by $3-$5 and oil change stations by $10-$15. Why pay more if you don't have to? This is generally not an emergency part, so waiting a day or two for shipping makes it worth its while."
5,Prog,"I wasn't always a fan of the Bad Plus. Then I saw them on Conan O'Brien and liked what I saw on the show, so I decided to get some of their records. Well they're growing on me. (I was digging their Blondie cover the other day)It's very clear that the band's signature is taking pop/rock tunes, or just songs that haven't really been done by other jazz artists, and twisting them around in a rather humurous way. Maybe it would get old, but this group certainly plays well enough to keep it interesting.Not being much of a rock fan myself, I don't really know many of the tunes on this album that were radio hits except for Rush's Tom Sawyer and Burt Bacharach's This Guy's In Love With You; made famous by Herb Alpert.Maybe it is time for a new twist, and although there are far more ridiculous songs to cover, maybe they need something else. However, this album is enjoyable enough for repeated listenings."
3,Erratic reproductions,"Most art books stand or fall by the quality of their color plates. This Giotto volume is typical of the Konemann Masters of Italian Art series: some really beautiful reproductions, and others which seem weirdly pale or green-tinted. I'm not sure why this happens; nevertheless, know that when you buy one of this set you're getting a mixed bag."
5,nice single,"All of the songs are wonderful ,you won't regret to have it.Deserve to buy it , supprt Beyonce.."
3,Whats Missing?,I am a little disappointed..... No matter how you dress it up. A great voice does not make up for average material.
5,"Concise, comprehensive international project-management handbook","This book offers a curious combination of wide generalizations about managing projects overseas, and extremely detailed guidance in the shape of project-management forms and checklists. Owen Jay Murphy explains obvious information - people pursue international projects to make money and folks in other countries have different customs. Yet he also provides sophisticated information, like detailed, complex data on some Six Sigma techniques, and project evaluation and review templates such as Gantt, PERT and WBS charts. At its best, getAbstract finds that this book provides a reasonably easy-to-read summary of some crucial steps and useful tools for managing international projects."
1,Hyundai L70N Not Very Reliable,"I have bought the L70N for 3 years ago and during those 3 years, I have been constantly having problems with the monitor losing power randomly. It finally died completely a few months ago and there is no place for me to open the monitor to check what is wrong inside. Beware of the power issues that a lot of users have with this and if anyone knows how to open this monitor, let me know."
4,"It's not pretty, but it is pretty cool","If you're a college radio listener, or and indie fan or even just a bizarre music junkie, how can you pass this up?Innovative, if weird, bands and performers singing accepella!Like any of these compilations, there are gems and , well, lets just say songs that aren't so gemmy. But who doesnt need a haunting version of La Vie en Rose in their collection?"
4,Sounds of something else,"This cd is a very intereseting listen, all voice no music(well there is some clapping.) Remmeniscent of old dust bowl/depression error music, Of course with a modern twist. Worthy of multiple plays."
5,Pleasure & pain,"What more can be said, the other reviewers cover it all, this is simply the best most original Sci Fi series available. But also the most frustrating. Please put us out of our misery David finish the next volume !! PS Please don`t start another I don`t want to go through this again."
3,Epics & such,"Well, I read the three first books of 'the war', and definitely I found it very entertaining and engaging. However, I should have known better... The last time I felt that way was with Stephen Donaldson and OSC, however after reading the trilogies and ender's stuff, I found that the next stage (that was the Gap and for OSC homecoming) the stories had run dry and creativity was lacking. And now Gerrold, great author, but as everybody else falling into the trap of producing these endless series, trapping the readers. I won't buy a S for S, because what I read here just confirms what I felt with SD & OSC. Oh well, Ursula K le Guinn is still the greatest. Cheers-p"
5,The best yet...,"This is without question the most impressive book from this incredible series.If you haven't read the preceding three books yet DO! The series has such a wealth of strengths it's difficult to list them all, but in short there is: biological and environmental science, social dynamics and politics (both personal and beaurocratic), military action and technology and superb extrapolations of American society in the next century.The Moral Philosophy (a la Starship Troopers) some will find unpalatable but I found it inspiring. Every time I read the passages about Mode training I want to sign up! I'd like to add that its principles should be taught to all our teenagers, everywhere, because it would make the world a much better place.If the huge volume of great reviews for this book haven't swayed you into buying this series take my personal recommendation, you have my Word that you won't be disappointed!"
4,It's the Chtorr or you!!!,"David Gerrold forth book Season for Slaughter is a very good book: It explains alot about the Chtorran infestation: The characters have how would you say it ""come of age"" in this book. If you liked the other three books you will like this one.. It gives you alot more than the first three where McCarthy and Lizard (the two main characters for those of you how are not sure) and the Chtorreans are concerned. I give this one 2 thumbs up ^"
3,Psychic Roots: Serendipity ...,I was disappointed; not what I was expecting. No longer sitting on my book shelves.Others probably will have a different opinion.
4,Fantastic Beginner Book,A fine outline of the game of Poker for the home enthusiast who wants to move from the beginner stage and begin to become a better player. Great discussion on probability and bluffing in the home game.
4,not bad,"its a good book, starts off pretty dry and relatively simplistic but gets better after the tells section. The characters he uses help and remind you of people you find in your average game. the only problem is 1/3 of the example hands he uses end in you or your opponent getting quads... considering this book is based on a lot of probability that doesnt really work out. a decent read, worth looking over"
3,Disappointing,"The beginner-to-intermediate information other posters mention is good, maybe some of the best in the field. But I was expecting some meat on games OTHER than stud, hold 'em, and Omaha, in other words some stuff on the weird ones that make dealer's choice sessions so much fun. Many writers have handled these three games well before Steiner, but we still have to go back all the way to A.D. Livingston's book to get anything on games like Criss Cross and Anaconda, and with modern players using eight-or-better, that's not good enough. Also he doesn't explain why home game play should be MUCH looser than in casinos. Good material, and a lot of it, but generally I think he took the lazy way out."
5,excellent book -- well researched,"I echo what other reviewers have written: This book is better for the average home game where the stakes are low and play is loose. At the same time, the average home player may find the mathematical detail and the discussions of expected values difficult to follow. That doesn't negate their value, however, and I find that the academic approach Steiner uses is great (what other poker book has footnotes?). In particular, his discussions of the more popular games -- draw, 7-card stud, 7-card hi-lo, hold 'em (texas and omaha), etc. -- are valuable. Even if you have to reread some of the sections to fully comprehend them, it's an excellent foundational treatise on poker."
5,A Great Resource,"This is a great book for anybody who is studying or likes reading Russian Literature. It has an informative article on practically every Russian writer that you'll need to know about, although a few of the more contemporary ones are omitted.In addition to providing a thorough biographical sketch for each author, it also mentions the major works of each author and gives critical opinions and brief analyses of many of the works. The major translations available are listed at the end of each entry.I like reading the sketch on an author before I begin reading his or her work. It provides a great introduction."
2,Book with Sticker,"Everything about this book is fine but I really don't prefer when there are advertisements pasted to the back (or front, thankfully this time it was the back) of books. I would be more likely to respond if it was somewhere else in the packaging, but not directly on the book. Otherwise, thanks!"
3,"Great performance, bad sound!","This could have been a rather good recording, but the extemely poor soundquality does great unjustice to the good performance. As far as I know this is the only version availible on CD today, the same recording is issued by the german company Cantus Classics, but I have not heard that. A new recording of this neglected work is strongly desired."
5,amazing. just wish it was cheaper.....,"i bought this for under $6 so i can't complain, but seriously this should be priced like a single not an album. it's only 18 minutes long and its really only one song. i do so love this song though. i think it is simply brilliant in its instrumentation and its content. It feels like something Zeppelin or Floyd might have done if they were lost as sea. or maybe i'm crazy. either way, i'm a fan of this here band my little brothers and sisters."
4,Quick shipment,Purchased Flexmend with MSM due to neighbor recommendation. Product arrived quickly so I hope for joint improvement soon.
5,GREAT,I keep a spare in the charger so when the battery runs down in the middle of a cleaning job I can switch it out and keep going.
5,Long lasting,A great battery to go along with a great cordless vacuum. The best of its class on the market - battery and vacuum.
1,lasted 10 months,I ordered this battery in Feb of this year and its already starting to die in October. This is our third battery for the vac and the others lasted at least two years each.
5,Eureka!!! Just the replacement I was looking for,"Item was just as described and works perfectly as a backup battery for my Eureka! I had some backup batteries from my old Eureka products, but they do not work well even after a full charge. It was time to replace them. This one does the trick! I'm glad I made this purchase."
3,"Great When New, But Loses Charge Over Time","Battery works well when new. A full charge gives about 15 minutes of constant run time before needing a charge. However, since this is a nickle cadium battery and not a lithium ion, the memory effect takes place so over time it gradually loses the ability to retain a charge.I bought one about a year ago but need a new one.I wish Eureka redesigned their vacuum to use a lithium ion battery instead.But since the cost is this replacment battery is only about $20, a once a year replacement isn't so bad for the convenience of going cordless."
2,Short lasting life,"I bought the Eureka vacuum in April 2010. It came with a ""bonus"" replacement battery. The original battery lasted for almost 16 months which I was happy enough with. One full charge could sustain 15 minutes or so, enough for me to finish the light vacuuming of the kitchen and the aftermath in children's rooms. The ""bonus"" battery never worked well from day 1: After only 2-3 minutes, the battery had already been exhausted. So I threw that one out and bought this replacement battery in Sep. 2011. It worked well at the beginning. The problem is, one charge now lasts only 5 minutes. So this battery's life is less than 5 months."
5,WORKS GREAT!,FIT PERFECTLY INTO MY LITTLE EUREKA STICK VACUUM AND DID MAKE THE DIFFERENCE IN THE VACUUM'S PERFORMANCE. SAVES HAVING TO BUY ANOTHER VACUUM.
4,Just what I needed,Works great. I would have given it 5 stars but I need to see how long the battery pack lasts.So far so good.
1,Lasted about a month...,After the first month it stopped holding a charge. For the amount of money I spent on this thing and the vac that goes with it (that battery also died after about a month) I could have bought to replacement battery for the rechargeable vac I already had and been happy. Lesson learned!
4,You Need This!,"If you have the Eureka vacuum you need an extra battery so one is always charged -- the lifespan is just enough for us to do a small kitchen,living, dining room and 2 bedrooms with wood floors - that's it and 'out of juice' - grab another battery so you have one charged."
4,"So far, it works.",I received the battery in early December. It fit my vacuum perfectly. Once it was charged it worked well. I only hope it lasts more than a couple of months.
5,Wrong Battery,"I bought the wrong battery. I need tha battery from the Eureka oss Lite, batery model 98B. I feel that it has been discontinued. If you have them I need two. Incidently they have been great for me and have lasted a very long time.Also Can I return the one I receivd?"
5,Eureka Battery,"I have wanted to get the second battery for a long time. The old one finally quit working after 5 years. Now that I have two batteries, the portable vacumm will clean most of the house.I am bery pleased."
4,Good value,"The item was delivered intact and after an overnight charge worked great.The color is beige (not what was pictured), but that is not a big deal."
1,Eureka cordless vacuum and extra battery,The cordless vacuum is VERY poorly designed. The extra battery does not fit well in the charging cradle and is not user friendly.
3,Good Battery,"having a spare battery has been great. The batteries won't last but so long when in use, so having a charged spare is always helpful. Battery life seems to go down the more we recharge it, but it has still be worth the purchase."
4,It's a battery!,What can you really say about it? This battery will give you about 15 minutes of power. We use our cordless vac at the preschool every day and switch between two batteries. Seems a bit expensive though considering the vacuum it fits is can be purchased for slightly over 2X the price of the battery.
4,"So far, so good","It killed me to pay so much for a replacement battery, but it works as promised. I will report back once I see how long it lasts..."
5,Batteries,"The item was exactly what I wanted,priced the best, it arrived promptly and works just great. What more is there to say ?"
2,Disapointed,I am disappointed that I received a model 39150 rather than the 60776 as advertised. I believe the newer 60776 is NMH rather than the older NICAD.
2,didn't last long...,great vaccum...love it...battery just doesn't last....got a new one and it didn't either... such a shame..love to see this perfected..
1,Worthless,I should have sent this battery pack back! It was worse than the original that came with the Eureka cordless vacuum that I bought it for. Five minutes of use and this battery was dead. Don't waste your money.
4,Bizarre and intriguing music,"The works of Clement Janequin are somewhat neglected, despite there being an ensemble dedicated to him (the Janequin Ensemble perform on this album). This is unfortunate, because Janequin was one of the strangest and most interesting composers of pre-Baroque music. Some of his songs--particularly the title track--are full of bizarre vocal effects which add both impressive virtuosity and humor to his compositions. This is a good selection of music performed by a good ensemble, although the whiny, nasal voice of countertenor Dominique Visse is ever-present."
1,What the hell is this?,"This is classified as hiphop, I'm still trying to work out what the hell it is I just heard. It certainly wasn't hiphop, the track ""Trees"" is totally whack! It's like some 80's disco hippy tune and the rest of the album is just random noise. Very bizarre, acid trip-type album that leaves you wondering wtf was that I just tortured my ears with?! The track ""A Gorilla Driving a Pick-Up Truck"" is particularly odd, this album really makes no sense at all and it sounds really bad. What else can I say? lol"
1,I actually like it a little,I think its pretty cool especially considering kool keith's ouvre but i'm rating it one star casue of all the scandalous rumors about the record label.
2,weird but not kool!,"when,first listening to parts of ""The return of Dr octagon"" i believed it was Keith's doing.....i might have heard parts of 3 or 4 tracks and thought ""ants"" and ""trees"" were not all that bad.but it isn't the Dr octagon sound,if you want something near the sound of the original Dr octagon album,order ""Project polariod"" and you will be satisfied.after a second listening,i decided to order this and was hoping for better tracks that made it something like 'Mr nogatco"" but the overall feeling is disappointment!i ordered it,because i love to collect a lot of keith's stuff......i included, ""The undertakers"" and the ""Collabs tape"" and an other cd of keith,and i will enjoy these,when they arrive......the return of Dr octagon,however,might bore me very soon!let Dr octagon have a real return.....one with dignity!"
2,Bad. Don't Buy.,"So I bought this album on iTunes, thinking it was legit.... It got two stars, because ""Trees"" isn't terrible. The rest is garbage."
3,The Return of Dr. Octagon is just decent.,"This is a very nice and decade from dr. octagan who has made some good things in the past, now he does it here, some good songs on there that made people think, if you tired of trashiness that is continuing to ruin our airwaves then this is the one for you.Thumbs up for me."
1,this isn't really dr. octagon,"dr. octagon was kool keith and automator. this record is a bunch of german guys creating songs out of little keith snippets that he supposedly recorded years ago. there are a few songs that have good beats and feature some of the strangeness that made dr. octagon and some of the other keith personas great, but this pales in comparison to the first record.i feel ripped off for buying this."
2,NOT the FanatikJ release,"Just to clarify, this may be a Kool Keith release, but it's not a good one. As far as I know it hasn't been disavowed yet. There's maybe 2 songs with actual new KK material on them.And this is NOT the FanatikJ version (which, last I heard, was still not scheduled for release), this is the ""One Watt Sun"" version."
4,This is really good,"I don't know what to make of the controversy around this album, but, it is actually pretty sick. The music is excellent, and it works with Keith's parts very well, too. Listening to it, it's hard for me to believe that this was not the album that Kool Keith meant to make. So I don't know."
1,Dr Octagon,where can i read about this beef and how this release is shady? Ive been looking everywhere and also trying to find the real dr octagon on myspace but there has been nothing. someone please help... thanks!!
2,OK this is a serious issue,"Listen the thing about Kool Keith is that he is a hit and miss artist. I personally believe that when he hits, he blows away far toom any people. When he misses it is becuase he is involved with wack artists or record company's/production crews. The conspiracy theories are true. Keith did not approve this album but honestly it is not as terrible as people are rating it. It is bizzare and somewhat strange but HELLO that is what an Octagon album is. The production is not terrible but it certainly is too European to hide. I can picture some French kids getting down to this or maybe somebody getting high in Amsterdam.On principle that Keith is being ripped I cannot support this album BUT it has some ok tracks like ""dr. Octagon"". Rip this off Kazaa and enjoy its not terrible but do not support independent artist abuses."
1,This record is stolen property!!!!,"The record label on this project have released this album without Kool Keith's approval. It is nothing close to being as good as the original Dr. Octagon. The entire album is made up of years old snippets of Kool Keith's vocals and some horrible techno production. If you buy this album, you will be ripping off Keith and putting money in the pockets of some crooks. AND THE ALBUM SUCKS!!! SlickRick76!"
3,Typical gunfighter-for-hire paperback,"At the young age of 17, Jesse Hand is taught the skills of gunfighting and gambling at the poker tables. Storyline is basically Jesse's struggle to change his lonely life-on-the-run."
5,AWESOME!!!,"This is the single most insightful book about our country and society, how we got here and where do we go?...This is an incredible book that all of the silent majority should read! A wonderful book wish you could get his other books as well! Paul Cedervall"
3,okay,"I liked it and I didn't. It seemed pretty good at first. I thought that it would be a sweet romance. But the guy happens to meet the girl, he's attracted to her, and they become friends. At least a couple of time before she's married Archibald, the guy asks her to marry him. She says no and wonders if she made a mistake. Well, shortly after the ""marriage"" things change and the guy offers again. This time Sara accepts. Eventually they end up together and it's like he's a different character. He acts like he was trapped and had no choice. It just seemed inconsistent and bothered me. Maybe I missed something crucial. Anyway, I've liked their other books much more."
5,FINALLY A CLEAN FANCIFULL ROMANCE,"I loved the characters of Jericho Wilde and Sara Young.Naive, touchingly innocent for all of Sara's claims to being practical and knowledgeable?Such a wonderful break from all of the PMS of the run of the mill romance stories. I can't remember why it took me so long to read it. This book is a keeper for my library.Titus Smithers lends just enough lite level villianry to be a distraction and reason for Jericho and Sara to meet. Now Rafe Turbyfill and Ivadelle Moyer, that was a twosome that left me grinning and questioning their reasons for being there.I must say that I will continue to collect all of their works since reading The Warfield Bride and continue to wish they would enlarge on those brothers. But there is no accounting for the way these authors come up with their subject matter.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED -- I suggest that you will still enjoy this book."
1,Pretty awful,"Purchased at a local box store. Nothing about the optical performance of these binoculars is acceptable. Hard to focus, deplorable edge performance. Will be returning them to the store. Really, really crappy."
5,"Cory keeps it real with ""real"" country music","I like all of his songs from back when he first started out, from ""big city stripper"", to ""choices"". This c.d. I think is a good break out c.d. for people who arent familiar with TX country music, but want to have a taste. Plus he's a cool mfer' to see in concert!"
5,Great CD,"AWESOME CD. I've always been a Cory fan, but this CD is definitely my favorite so far. Every track on it is great!"
5,very country,i wanted to discover this guy because his comming in france this summer and i can tell you that I 'm waiting for next july to see im on stage.
2,Type too small,The information is good and of value if you have good eyes. I could not read the small type. Book shipped timely.
3,Good content but let down by B/W Photo,"It could have been a pleasure to read the book if the photos would have been colored . Though , the print is small and quality of page is not that good but then you can't expect more at such a affordable price.Ajay Bhardwaj"
2,Gem cutting,Not what I was looking for. Needing something for a beginner in this craft. This book is for someone more experienced
5,20 years waiting,"I really have to compliment the people at RHINO...I'm sure the master tapes were not in the best condition at the time of restoration, the quality is as good as can be expected with some extras added to bring a new-fresh feeling to a series that was enjoyed by kids over 20 years ago. I have watched these with my 5 year old nephew reliving parts of my childhood, and he loves it as much as I do!!!! this is a must have for anyone who yearns to return to their 80's childhood."
5,Just so everyone knows...,"This dvd, as stated in Previews Magazine, will only be 24 episodes of season 2. Another release will include the remaining episodes. This was done because there were 49 (I think) episodes in season 2. I wrote this review to tell people it isn't the whole season, not to give a full review of the dvds, as they won't be out for two more months so it is impossible"
3,Better than Season One Remastering but.....,"Transformers Season Two had much better story lines than the first and improved animation. This is the season before the movie. The remastering isn't as poor as the first season, where Rhino added in all that []digital colors (i.e. orange rocks) so the video looks pretty good. The audio...well I am not a BIG fan with all the reverb and newly added sound effects & explosion sounds that were never in there; but I guess a lot of people like it. I would prefer a ""original"" soundtrack option in the menu as the enhanced explosions are too loud (bad compression). Another error was Rhino sticking in season one bumpers...and one episode had GI-JOE music!? WHAT THE...who is doing this remastering anyway? Does Rhino even care?Overall it's a convient set to have, but in my opinion I prefer the analog originals...for retro sake and disliking of newly added errors and sound."
4,A great start to season 2,The first part of this season starts of great and builds up quickly with a number of multi-episode stories. I had a great time watching these and they still capture kids attention 20+ years later.
3,Transformers Season 2 Part 1,"I loved the Transformers while growing up and still do. I can watch them over and over again. Only problem I have had. Was on disc 4 during the episode ""Blaster Blues"" It kept freezing up on me as well. The last episode ""A Decepticon In King Arthur's Court"" was even worse. I have taken it to the local PX here on base where I am currently stationed at and had it cleaned and refinished twice and after about the 3rd time taking it there finally started working better. I also read a review from someone else that complained about it on the Transformers Season 2 Part 2 reviews."
3,"Great album,but flaw in disc spoiled it for me.","I was very disappointed to discover a flaw,or tiny hole in the c.d. which meant it played badly on track one,skipping.I was really looking forward to receiving this album,as I have it in l.p. form and knew how good it wasI shall send it back to you, and thought you might be able to send back to me the Les Brown,Hollywood Palladium c.d. as a goodwill gesture. I think they are about the same price.I am generally happy with your service and delivery and hope to con tinue to patronise Amazon. Please let me know if this idea is acceptable. I require a cd,not mp3, of Les Brown,thank you.Many thanks.Graeme Lyndon."
1,WARNING to Painters and Professionals,"Trimaco changed their Red Rosin paper early spring last year, they sold it under the same SKU number. However, the paper is very different, the color for one, is Brighter Pink and the weight is much thinner. If you spill any water or thinner or lacquer the pink color stains your floor underneath PERMANENTLY it will not come off. Wood floors , tile and Vinyl!Being paint professionals for over 10 years, we contacted Trimaco and all we got was the run around."
2,Keep Looking,"I have had a great deal of difficulty with this book.1. It does not provide a clear or thorough breakdown of grammar.2. It does nothing to explain the Lao alphabet to English speakers, nor does it even provide the Lao spelling of any words for reference. (Romanized only)3. The phonetic method used is extremely awkward and inaccurate; my neighbors (who are from Laos, who speak and read English fluently) had great difficulty in decifering the system used.I am in the process of searching for a better tutorial, and I advise others to do so as well!"
3,OK for Laotian-Americans to Learn,"Purchased for my mother, but my nieces and nephew enjoyed it more as they were learning how to speak and communicate in Lao with their Grandparents. This this is good for someone that does not speak Laos at all and are trying to come up with phrases to say to others."
2,Good for a quick pocket guide,"I think this is best used as a quick pocket guide. It lacks the actual Lao script/spelling and since there is no formal way of transliterating Lao, pronunciation is left to the reader to decipher.I do think however, it is a good beginners intro to Lao or for someone who just needs to know some basics. Convenient pocket size."
5,The BEST alarm clock I've ever owned!,"I must have went through a half dozen different alarm clocks before I found this little dream machine. It's easy to set, easy to shut off, sounds good, let's you know the day and the date when you wake, etc... The only negative is that the display is a little too bright. I love it just the same though."
5,Best alarm clock you'll ever buy,"This is an incredible clock, and an amazing value!It actually looks much sexier than the photo. The functions are perfect. Speaking as one who (as a frequent traveler) has had to deal with hundreds of terrible alarm clocks over the years, I was stunned when this one won my immediate affection. It's terrifically easy to use and read. You cannot go wrong!"
3,Good Clock/Night Light,"Purchased this clock for the dual weekday/weekend alarms and auto set function. Performs well at both tasks. Found the radio hard to tune even for the strongest stations as well as exhibiting poor sound quality. The green LED display is inappropriate for an alarm clock. H.H. Scott - consider using red seven segment displays. The alarm clock will light up your bedroom even on the dimmed setting. If you prefer a dark room for a good nights sleep, look elsewhere for an alarm clock. Other than the undesirable night light feature, the clock is acceptable. I will probably cover the display with red acetate rather then return the item."
2,Really Great...Until...,"I loved this cloack radio for a while. After a year or so, the line segments that make up the time started to burn out one at a time. Now so many of them are off, the time is completely unreadable. The alarms still go off very reliably, but I defy you to set the alarm or read the time with only about half the bars working."
2,LOUSY TINNY SOUND,"What a great idea! A clock radio that knows when it's daylight savings time and will adjust itself for 99 years (leap years too) And best of all, the long life lithium (CR2430) battery backup installed in the radio. It's to bad the sound on this radio sounds ...[low cost] and tinny. ..."
4,Great Item For The Price,"Just got this item and love it. It has a bright green, easy to read display including date and day of the week. What I like best is the ability to set the same time of day to wake up Monday through Friday and have it off on Saturday and Sunday. Plus if you lose power the clock will reset to the correct time and keep your alarm times saved.The only two small drawbacks are the radio sound quality and the size of the buttons to turn the alarm off in the morning. I had some trouble tuning in even close FM stations and the buttons are pretty small except for the snooze button.But, for $30, this could be the last clock/radion you have to buy."
3,good product,"The clock really does not not set itself, it is pre programmed from the factory with the diffrent time zones and a battery back up . If the battery dies you cant just plug it in and it resets itself you have to reset it manually. Its not an atomic clock. really no diffrent than any clock with a battery back up. But it is a nice clock. Love the weekend feature."
2,good until it died,"This was a good alarm clock until it suddenly died around a year from when I bought it--they do have a limited one year warranty, but I'm having a problem finding my receipt, oh well! The alarm clock I had before this one since about 20 years--Lloyd--and only replaced it to get a modern-looking one--guess they don't build'em like they used to."
1,Daylight Savings is Out of Date,This product would be rated outstanding if it were up to date regarding daylight savings time. The memory chip inside this clock was programmed prior to 2006 when the rules for Daylight Savings Time changed. Therefore it will change to Daylight time one hour later in the spring and one hour earlier in the fall than the rest of the country. I know this because I have this clock and I purchased this new one thinking it was updated. Its Not.This is really unfortunate because otherwise it works great and the included battery inside for power failures has lasted at least 6 years. If you don't mind the hassle of having to work around the wrong automatic daylight savings time change (you have to know when to make the switch) this is the clock for you (and me too if they ever update it).
4,Excellent Clock,"If you live where poweroutages are a common occurance, you will love this clock. From the first moment you plug it in, it knows what time it is. It has flexible alarm settings and is easy to set. The only thing that keeps me from giving this product a 5 star rating is the size and placement of the alarm activiation switches. Not a big deal, but seem a little hard to operate. As for the radio... it is what you would expect from a 1 inch speaker... not a lot of bass, but I didn't buy this clock for high quality audio... I bought it as an alarm clock. Overall, it is a great product and does a far superior job to keeping and displaying the time than to any other clock radio I have owned."
2,Don't count on good radio!,The Auto time is great and I would recommend it if you use the beeper to wake you. My Sister bought it and is returning it because 1. It's not purple like in the picture (it's blue). and 2. Because the radio reception is poor.
5,Ultimate Ice Cream Experience,"This is the ultimate ice cream scoop--the aluminum handle is filled with antifreeze to conduct the heat from your hand to the blade of the spade, helping the non-stick spade to slide easily through the ice cream. It makes even the coldest, toughest ice cream scoopable. I've had mine for years, and given almost a dozen away as gifts--and this from an ice cream enthusiast who has discarded several inferior scoops. Hint: Don't wash--just rinse after scooping and put it back in the drawer."
2,Thoma and friends: Thomas and the runaway kite,The entire family ranging from 7 months to 64 years old watched this. The four year old totally enjoyed it and cheered the trains on. We were all entertained and enjoyed our time together.
1,"History of Todd County, Kentucky","I am very disappointed in this book. I should have really looked closer at the size. It is the size of a Reader's Digest, but just a bit thicker. It is crowded on the pages, cheap reproduction and hard to read. Certainly not worth the high cost of purchasing it. Plus that it took over one month to get it here."
5,blue thunder racing wheel,"This one awesome wheel. It fits perfectly under my legs, and the stick shift is really nifty. It's hard to find a racing wheel with a stick shift. It works with almost all the ps2 games and it also has the four buttons that are on the controllers."
1,Can't get it to work on Playstation One,"We bought this wheel for my son's playstation game. It doesn't do anything. We took it back and got another thinking the first one was broken. Same result with the second one. We hook it up, all properly done. The only lights that come on are the start and set buttons. The select button never comes on. We can hit the start button and get into the game, but that's as far as we can get. We can't choose anything from that point on and therefore cannot play. All games worked fine with the regular controller. What games exactly work with this for PSONE? We tried Gran turismo, Gran turismo 2, nascar and all the rest my son has. Can anyone help? And yes, I tried calling their phone number and emailingthem..."
1,Busted!!,"Product arrived with a crease in the plastic. It can't be fixed. Elastic doesn't allow correct fit on head causing visor to be constantly ""too tight"". That's OK if you like headaches. And if that weren't enough the visor comes with a Prop 65 cancer warning....just what you want to have on your precious head, NOT.And don't be fooled: $1.95 item that weighs about 2oz has outragous shipping cost....everthing together was over $7.00....what a rip-off."
4,What a change!,"I just picked up this record, the only Nips music available to the general public, and I thought maybe the case was wrong and that someone slipped some early Clash into this sleeve. The spitfire delivery of Joe Strummer or Johnny Rotten leaps out over three chords and a bassline straight from the Ramones first record. Shane MacGowan barely sounds like the Shane we would all come to love as the frontman of the Pogues and yet this record is undeniably pure Shane. If you want the Irish stuff, don't look here. If you wanna throw your fist in the air and pogo like it's 1977, spend the ten bucks."
4,Excellent Exploration,"This book will remind you of other epic fantasy novels - The Lord of the Rings, Dragonlance, etc. I believe that's intentional.Ms. Carey takes the framework of these epics and turns it on it's head: most of the action we see from the viewpoint of minions of the ""evil"" Lord Satoris, particularly his general, Tanaros. But are they really evil? This book sheds some light on the shades of grey that are usually missing from such epics.Oh, and something purely informative - this does not contain sex, unlike the Kushiel's series, whether that's to your taste or not."
4,Friendly Advice,"Just some friendly advice from the Observant Hermit Crab: read this book and its sequel, Godslayer, back to back, for it seems as if it is meant to be one book. Peace be with you always!"
4,Um Different,"I bought this book because I loved Jacqueline Carey's Kushiel's Legacy series. This is way different but I should have expected as much. It's a well written, very detailed book and definitely gives a new perspective on good vs evil."
3,"well written, boring","I have loved and quickly devoured all the Kushiel books, but this book just left me cold. It was a difficult read, not because the plot was so involved, but because it was really dull. I normally would read a Kushiel book in about two days max. It took me four weeks to finish this clunker. I found myself not really caring about a single character in it, and I won't read any more books in the series."
1,Incredible Disappointment,"I can't believe from reading this book that it is the same author. The book is so poorly written it is mind boggling. Only love of the Kushiel's series caused me to continue to plow through the bad prose, the Tolkienesque plot (I am sure there are a FEW original ideas left in the world that Carey did not have to do this cheap knockoff plot), and the unappealing characters. Normally, once I start reading a writer's work, I am committed. However, I think I will stop here with Carey's works. Maybe I will try the next series. This was such a disappointment."
2,I really tried to read it...,"I am a huge fan of Carey's Kushiel series so I was more than excited when I picked up Banewreaker. I even launched into several small ""Why Jacqueline Carey is great"" speeches to friends and family before reading the book. I enjoyed giving the speeches and I am glad to discover that, even after reading this book, I still enjoy Jacquline Carey. If you are looking for a great novel, pick up 'Kushiel's Dart' and leave this one alone.There is just too much, too much happening here for belief. The previous reviews I've read have mentioned how much these books resemble Tolkien and yes, I definitely agree... but there's more. There are no characters to identify with in this book. The plot is predictable and had too much long winded prose. I was really sad to realize about half way through that I was actually bored and didn't care what happened in the rest of the book.So, to sum: Kushiel series, yes. Sundering series, no."
3,"Jumps in too fast, makes up for it later","For a good portion of this book I found it very lacking - character development seemed weak, backstory was only barely hinted at, I just couldn't care about any of the pro/antagonists.And the prophecy - the whole book revolves around the prophecy, but she just delivers it like a dictionary definition, with really no explanation of where it came from, is it unique, how old is it, nothing. Even a simple preface of an ancient character having a vision and delivering the prophecy for the first time would have gone a long way in making the story more enjoyable.Oddly enough, towards the end of the book, she starts to give more backstory, character depth and motivations. Because of this 11th hour effort, I will give book 2 a chance."
4,Go Ahead and Read It,"Okay, so it's no ""Kushiel."" I was very wary of reading this book after reading the reviews, but now that I've finished it, I'm glad I bought the book. Yes, there are similarities to Tolkien and Eddings but in the realm of fantasy, is that so rare? Admittedly, ""Banewreaker"" doesn't have the intensity or the complexity of the Kushiel Legacy, but that doesn't make it garbage. If you start reading this book with an open mind--or just don't expect it to be like Carey's previous work--you should enjoy the read."
2,Just couldn't get into it.,I've read every other series put out by her but this one I just couldn't get into. The droning prologue killed it from the get go for me.
1,Banewreaker: Volume I of The Sundering,I know Jaqueline Carey can write better than this series. I felt she over explained and that the book drug in many places. A least a third could have been left out and it still could have been a great read. I usually like all certain authors books that they write this is few & far between when I don't like one series.
4,A Great Book,"I think this novel is an excellent one. Those who criticize it as merely a Tolkien rip-off are, in my opinion, beyond help. Those readers are skeptics of the worst kind. They are pessimists.I think Carey knows exactly what she's doing here. If you want to read a Tolkien rip-off, read Eddings or the scores of others that have come and gone over the decades. Carey is a far better writer than any of the so-called ""me too"" novelists who have tried (and failed) to do a good Tolkien clone. Indeed, it is true that the vast majority of characters in Banewreaker have Tolkien equivalents, but they have so much more substance than ANY characters in LOTRs. I don't see how anyone with two eyes and a working knowledge of the English language could think otherwise.So I'm giving this one a strong thumbs up. Give it a shot. You may like it."
1,"Man, what a crappy book!","What happened to Jacqueline Carey? I didn't like her much when I first started reading the Kushiel trilogy, but I was persuaded by my wife to give the second and third book a try, and I have to admit to being mildly won over. But having got this for her as a birthday present, even she didn't want to finish it. What happened?Perhaps the only character Carey can really write is Phaedre, and maybe it's because she is in her own image. This attempt at standard fantasy, even with the take on evil, is boring and flat, the characters dull or annoying, and it has the distinct feel of a retread. It is certainly derivative, as other reviewers have noted.I guess I'm a tough critic. I haven't really read much in this genre that I've liked for a while, but I think that's George R. R. Martin's fault for taking so long to come out with the next one.My advice--read the Kushiel trilogy, but get them from the library in case they offend you. Avoid this one.Joe"
1,Disappointing,"I enjoyed the Kushiel series. It was fun and sexy. This is a bad Tolkein rip-off written by an angsty, emo Goth. Good grief, my 7th grade D&D; group came up with better plot-lines than this. Carey finds every cliche possible in Tolkienesque fantasy and uses them without mercy. Her characters are wooden. The writing style is unpolished. Even the NAMES are cliched. ""Rivenlost?""""Cerelinde?"" ""Tanaros?""The Kushiel series was fun to read. This is severely disappointing."
3,"Good, standard fantasy","I enjoyed this book thoroughly despite the fact that this is not on the same level of orginality as the authour's previous trilogy. The characters while not developed as extensively as they might have been are none the less enjoyable and their lack of depth is mitigated by and interesting setting and storyline. My only serious complaint is that this book was divided into two volumes, which I can only assume was a cash grab by the publisher. This single volume doesn't stand on its own very well and the success of the book(s) will be more easilly evaluated in the context of the second volume."
1,just read the silmarillion,"ok i NEVER write reviews, but how can someone who was so goooooood in the kushiel series write such derivitive crap like this? 2 chapters in and even the names (never mind the plot) arecompletely hijacked from tolkein's the silmarillion! go read that instead, it's much more fleshed-out. I know the silmarillion isnt as widely-read as the lord of the rings series, but come on! even the gods names are so alike! stick to kushiel......they are wonderful, inventive, gorgeous imagery.......get back to work on that series instead. there are enough bad ripoffs of tolkein out there already. (sword of shannara anyone?)"
2,Predictable and full of teen angst,"The premise of the book is fairly intriguing: a tale similar to Tolkien's but told from the ""evil"" perspective. Some of the characters are fairly interesting at first glance, but their repetitive unending sadness gets old. Your wife cheated on you? Well dude that sucks but I suggest you get over it, and not mope around like a douche bag for over 1000 years. I mean seriously, 1000 years? You expect me or any other human being with a brain to believe that after an entire mellenia, this idiot is still pining after some skank? I can tell this POS was written by a woman."
3,Not exactly fresh or timely,"Got my package nearly 2.5 weeks after ordering. The Pony Express ran the mail from St. Joseph, Missouri to Sacramento, California on horseback faster than that. When I got it, the expiration date was near and the powder appeared to have been sitting on someone's shelf for quite some time. I won't say what I found inside.Finally, I can't get the product description from the original manufacturer. In fact, I can't find anyone who'll admit to BEING the manufacturer. Where does this product come from? It was supposedly sold and the name changed but to whom? How can I get a ""FRESH"" product delivered in less than a week (normal postal delivery) and how can I find out more about the company who now supposedly manufacturers and distributes this product?Herbalife may be over-priced but at least they can answer my questions."
1,L-Arginine is not in the list of ingredients.,Go to[...] for a list of ingredients for this product L-Arginine was not in the list. or Google the Cardio SupportTM and find arc-nutrition. This product may have had L-Arginine in it at one time but it doesn't look like it does anymore. It would be a serious over site to not include 5000 mg of L-Arginine on the list of ingredients. If you are looking for a true L-Arginine product for NO - Nitric Oxide production to help with blood pressure and circulation do your homework. I would find a product with L-Arginine & L-Citrulline in it they seem to need to work together from what I've read.
3,Cardio Support review,"Fast shipping and well packed.... Product seems to be helping a knee problem.... I have also noticed a slight drop in blood pressure (avg 2-5 points)... Tastes like orange flavored cardboard.. Its taste is tolerable, better if chilled.... Luckily its a 4oz water based serving.... All-in-all...not bad"
4,Small but shreds good,"Yes, this shredder is quite small, but for personal use it works quite well. It's ideal for putting it on a desk so it doesn't take up much room but you can still use it to shred receipts and such. It shreds everything into nice tiny pieces and is easy to dump out into the trash."
2,Smaller than it appears,"Recently returned this item due to the fact it would not meet our needs. Item was smaller than I thought although if I had read the entire description, I would have known and not purchased it. Total size is about as big as a large coffe can and the opening is very small. To shred a regular size paper, you would have to fold it in half the long way and insert it. I guess it would work if you wanted a small shredder on your desk and only shredded credit card receipts and such. Picture was a little misleading on size."
2,SMALL~!!!!!!!!!!!,"When I first opened the package, I said to myself ""Wait a min....is this what I paid for?"" Because it was tiny~!!!! LOL I was like ""You got to be kidding...~!! The smallest shredder I have ever seen in my life~!!"" I bought it for my home office use, and spent hrs researching for the best kind to buy, reading review, and etc. I finally got my ""well researched"" item in hand,....and and...~!!! Well, I guess I will have to stay with this for a while. It is UGLY design and color to go with it. Besides its Made in USA. SIGH...........SUCK. Will see how I will get used to this tiny machine sitting in my home office.....may be I will spray paint it, since its so ugly. As far as Size, I can not help it.....I can not imagine anyone would make such small paper shredder~! What were they thinking?"
1,Not worth the money,"No depth to this. Covers several areas such as flowcharts, calendars, office layout, etc. But none to any level of detail that you could be proficient at it. It doesn't even cover some of the pretty basic functions like using styles, or align/distribute shapes--things I think any beginner should learn about. I'd say you're better muddling through Visio's questionable help text than spending money on this."
3,Good tutorial; wish it had more depth.,"This book provides a series of step-by-step lessons on how to use Visio 2000. It's not intended to be a technical manual, but rather a hands-on guide to the program. I wish it had a little more meat to it (perhaps two examples instead of the one), but it's an OK buy."
2,Quality is bad. Doesn't last long,"I've had the Hot Sync for less then a year and it just started to flake out on me. It has a short somewhere in the plug. It really seemed like a cheaply made product. The push button to recoil the wire kept popping off. Overall, I don't recommend it."
4,GOOD PRODUCT.,Very lightweight and true color presentation. Took a little getting used to having another lens on top of my glasses but I am satisfied with it.
3,Seams undersized but works ok.,"I have a Barska 3-9x32 Plinker-22 scope which measures 1.545"" objective using calipers and this was hard to work onto the scope. It also is visible around the edge when looking through the scope. I double checked the size using calipers and the gauge that comes with the cover and it lines up exactly with the size 4 line. I thought maybe the cover got package wrong and was actually a #3 but there is a 4 molded into the rubber body so unless the is the cavity number for the tool this is supposed to be the correct size. I also got the #16 flip open eyepeice cover which fit correctly based on the 1.660"" eyepiece size.I do like the clear cover and don't need to open it to shoot which is nice since this is a barn gun and gets used where there is a lot of dust or in the rain and snow."
2,"Bought 2, 1 broke right away.","I have used these before with complete satisfaction. in this order, one of the two broke on the first day in the field. The second one would not keep the cap closed, kept popping open."
1,"Tires quickly, and needs to rest","This shredder is not intended for continuous (more than sixty seconds' duration!) shredding, or even shredding more than a half dozen pieces of paper one at a time. Inexplicably, it turns itself off after the briefest and mildest of workouts, as if to cool down. It stands to reason that if you need a shredder, you need one that wants to shred. This is not the one. There is at least one other inexpensive shredder on the market that is up to the task of average home-office shredding."
1,dissapointment,"Be carefull with Fellowes quality. After my first S40C-2 model shredder did not work, I took it back to Best Buy and got a replacement. The second one also failed to work, not sure if it's the power cord or if my Best Buy store got a defective batch. After reading many reviews it seems that lack of quality is endemic to paper shredders of several brands. The editorial review also mentions 4 sheet capacity and an indicator light, while the manual/box states a 5 sheet capacity and there is no such indicator light on the unit."
2,"I like fellowes, except for this product","I previously owned a fellows that lasted for two and a half years. After the motor just stopped working, I decided to go out and buy another Fellowes. This, I have to say, was a dissapointment. I used it for about two days, then on the third day, the blades must have gotten out of alignment and started grinding with eachother. Then I heard a loud clank, and the motor had stopped, but continued making a sad groaning noise. The poor motor started to overheat, because I left it on while trying to see what was wrong. My reason not to buy this product, is Fellowes does not make products like they used to, or maybe I just got a lemon."
1,Trash this shredder,"I have owned this shredder for a few weeks. It worked well for a while then it started getting clogged (with only 1 sheet of paper). I would reverse it and it would clean it self out, then clog back up with the next sheet of paper...DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!"
1,MisLabelled Shedder,"The Fellowes S40C-2 Confetti Paper Shredder (30400)by Fellowes is incorrectly labelled as a Confetti shredder.It is a cross cut shredder creating strips or pieces 5/32""x1-3/13"".A Confetti shredder should have pieces about the size of 1/2"" x 1/2"" or near it.I rated this unit only on the description, because I would have bought it thinking of the small piece it would create.But it does not So, I will not buy it.I already have a Cross-cut shredder and was looking to upgrade to smaller pieces.So, Thanks anyway but No Thanks."
2,Not durable and does not keep cold water out...,"In less than a month, the colored fabric started dis-integrating and loosening. Also from the get-go, the colored shoulders and thighs did not hug the body and now it is worst as cold waters easily sip in through and negates the entire purpose the suit was meant to serve.Price was attractive but utterly disappointed."
3,not what we expected,It is better than a swimming suit but my 4 years old son still feels water is too cold. So the wetsuit isn't warm enough.
2,Melissa q,"Pretty wet suit BUT for some reason, the neck is a bit small and the zipper goes all the way up. As a result, my daughter got a very bad friction burn at the nape of her neck which took 2 weeks to heal."
4,Good purchase!,Great fit. My son is no longer cold when swims in the winter. material moves with so its not confining.
3,cold water easily gets in through arms and legs,"I got this for my five-year-old. Works badly. The blue parts (sleeves and legs) are not only made of very thin fabric (no insulation capability), but they do not hug the body tightly at all. And there are no fasteners (velcro or other) to adjust the size of sleeve and leg openings. So, sleeve and leg openings just flap around like sleeves and shorts on street clothes. Which means cold water gets right in, reducing the insulation. This is not about the size -- the suit fits well otherwise -- it's about the design. They should have added fasteners to keep arm/leg openings closed in."
3,"OK, but not quite what I needed","I bought this to keep my kid warm in an outdoor pool in Orlando in February. It bought us about and extra 10 minutes of swim time before he turned into a total popsicle, but that was it. The water was heated to 72, and the air was 70. I really didn't think I was asking too much, but apparently I was... I think I needed something thicker and I KNOW I needed something with insulated arms - preferably long sleeves (this item has spandex sleeves and that's it)."
3,"Great features, wrong size","I really don't know if this wetsuit would have kept my son warm if it was the right size. i had read some reviews that talked about the size 6-8 being tight around the legs for their skinny 5 year old. my 5 year old is 50% in height and weight and the size 6-8 is enormous for him. it may keep him a tiny bit warmer, but in 83 degree water he still freezes. i'm going to try the smaller size because i like the weight, style, and comfort of the suit in general."
4,Salvation is from the Jews,"Excellent book, full of biblical references. Wonderful history of Jewish and Christian religiions. Provides great understanding of Jewish history up to present time."
3,A Jewish Quest for the Historical Jesus,"I chanced upon this book while looking for a forthcoming publication with the same title, this one by Aaron Milavec.Being a ""roamin' catholic"" and a student of the history of ideas for more than half a century, I ponder what differance it might have made if early Christianity had recognized and acknowledged the ethnicity of Jesus rather than the divinity of Christ.Left wondering in awe..."
1,A Farrago of Deception,"Mr. Schoeman is an ardent supporter of the Zionist Israeli state and his book is a farrago of deception based on misconstruction of concepts about the identity of contemporary ""Jews"" and the religion of Judaism, which is not the religion of the Old Testament. These issues are all dealt with in my book, ""Judaism Discovered: A Study of the Anti-Biblical Religion of Racism, Self-Worship, Superstition and Deceit."""
5,Welcome Back!,So glad Butch(Mike) is back! Can't wait for Jay to write the third! Noone tells a story quite like this. It should be mainstream!
2,Not worth it.,"I am not a fan of this tool. I got it to go with my single blade bosh planer.I've tried using it on a few projects without good success. This would probably be perfect for something, but I do not know what yet. This jig does not turn your planer into an accurate tool for rabbeting. It is also not as fast as my table saw. I wanted something to bust out without having to install a dado stack on my rigid table saw. I suppose if you're doing something where accuracy doesn't matter and portability does, this would be good. Otherwise I would stick with a regular dado blade and a sacrificial fence."
3,Rabbeting Depth Stop for Bosch Planers,"The rabbeting depth stop for Bosch planers is made from a stamped steel and attaches using the threaded hole on the side of the planer and the threaded knobbed bolt. It works to guide the planer along a board for a full width rabbet, unless a spacer board is used as the guide along side your piece of wood you are planing. I knew what I was getting, but this attachment could have been fabbed to provide selective width of cut. For general construction work it should provide an adequate guide."
3,A bit different,"I wouldn't suggest being the first book anyone gets or anything like that, but the book presents things that just weren't presented in any form back in the 1950s. Rolfe gives his impressions of a game and then occasionally drops notes to himself about players on the other team or even his squad. The book probably as a little more meaning to a Tiger fan, but I can see the interest being about the same for non-Tiger fans as well because of the material presented. It's more interesting to see the thinking of a manager through his journals. The 1950 Tiger season is represented so that's a plus for Tiger fans. Either this season or 1915 have to be the most under-appreciated strong Tiger seasons, so it's nice to see something about it in book form.A 3 star is probably a bit unfair. If this was on a scale of 1 to 10, I would've given it a 7, so 3.5 stars is fair."
2,great read,Great brain candy. Pure escapism. Quick read.I love everything Janet Evanovich writes. Good for a few laughs when life is hard.
4,A long ride.,"We purchased this CD at Amazon.com for our long ride from Michigan to California. The story was very good and kept us laughing the whole book. If you want something light to listen to while driving, this would be a good choice."
3,Not what I expected...,I got this book as an audio book based on customer feedback about the author and this book specifically. I was a little disappointed in the story line. I expected more of a fun mystery/thriller with a small love story and ending up getting a cheesy love story with a C- mystery.The audio version of this book was truly the worst I have heard. I have listened to many books as audio versions that were read much better in 'painting a picture'.I probably wont read another book by this author.
3,An Entertaining Bit Of Fluff.,"Louisa Brannigan, Washington D.C. press secretary to Senator Nolan Bishop, becomes involved with her upstairs neighbor, handsome hunky Pete Streeter, as they set out to solve the mystery of a disappearing pig. Yes, a disappearing pig! In this 1992 forerunner to Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series, it is possible to recognize the author's outrageous humor, and even glimpse the prototype for some of her later characters. This is a short entertaining read, one that you should be able to finish on a long flight or a trip to the hairdresser. It's fun fluff!JANA"
2,Disappointing,"I was disappointed in this book. Although it was humorous at times, the main characters were annoying. Part of the problem could have been that I listened to the audio version and the narrator was such a ham. She overacted and her reading was so over the top, it was extremely annoying."
4,"Entertaining, Fun Read","I am a big fan of Janet Evanovich, I like her humor and her story lines, most of the time. I have been honest in my reviews of some of her re-written or re-released stories from years back,some have not been up to her typical standards of humor and plot development; but I am happy to say this one pleased me. The reader did a good job bringing the story to life, the plot was funny, the hero and heroine people I cared about. This is not rocket science but a fun little story that helped pass the time on a long road trip. Enjoyable for the fans of this genre."
2,Disappointing,"I love janet evanovich, I have read all the books in this collection, this is by far my least favorite. Not all together terrible, just not nearly as good as the others."
4,Naughty Neighbor,"Janet Evanovich's books never fail to entertain. Even though this was not a Stephanie Plum book, it was funny, light and a great summer read."
5,Never disappointed!,"Janet Evanovich never disappoints! The characters are so much fun and humor, you can't help falling in love with them!Another great book from Janet Evanovich!"
3,Fun read,This is a fun story but not up to the M Plum books. Good for light reading. Like all her stories.
3,Quick Read,Story almost like Back to the Bedroom...just doesn't have Elsie in it.Cute and a quick readReady for more Plums!
5,"Outstanding, fun read","I totally LOVE all of Janet Evanovich's books. She is bright, witty, and entertaining. She entwines romance and adventure delightfully. Janet's books are a quick and easy read. Once you start reading, it's difficult to put down until you get to the last page. Once you have finished reading her books, you go away...feeling as if you personally know each and every character."
2,Audiobook version is awful,"Honestly, I don't This know if it was the story itself that was so bad, or if it was hearing it read by someone who sounded like my mother. I just couldn't get into the romantic scenes - the dialogue sounded so hokey and corny. And the way the narrator tried to do an accent for Kurt, but then kept forgetting to keep up with it - so sometimes Kurt's dialogue had a really bad accent and other times not.I don't mind stories where the main characters start off hating each other and then fall in love by the end.. but seriously - these characters had like one chapter of hating each other and then were in love like 5 minutes later. It was just bad.This was my first ever audiobook, so maybe I need to stick to print books. Or maybe I just need to stick with Stephanie Plumm and pass on the rest of Janet Evanovich's story lines."
1,RIP OFF!!,What a waste of time and money. Ms. Evanovich appears to be cashing in on her current celebrity in passing off this mediocre story to an unsuspecting public. It is certainly not of the same caliber as her more recent wrtiting efforts. The story and writing are sophomoric and should have been left in the attic to gather dust. For shame Janet.
1,Shadowblade control,"I purchased this stick and am very disgusted with it. I am having a terrible time programing the stick. I bought the game Rayman and couldn't get him to move in any direction. Why couldn't they build a stick that is plain and simple instead of one that needs to be programed. Maybe I'm stupid but I just couldn't program it, now I am stuck with a limited amount of games. It seems to just work on the certain games. Fine if you don't have to get any characters to walk."
1,Terrible product,"I tried this stick out to compliment my old Namco arcade stick. They shou'dve spent less time with the metal, and put more of the money into developing responsive buttons and a stick that registers motion correctly. None of the extra features matter if the basic design is flawed so deeply. A controller's first and really, only purpose is to enable you to move your character around smoothly onscreen. The Shadowblade fails at this. I've used Ascii sticks, Hori sticks, Mas sticks, and the Shadowblade isn't even close though it shares a similar price range.Shop around. There are way better sticks out there. Especially if you're a fighting game fan, you're just torturing yourself if you buy this mess."
3,A Really Good Opera But A Poor Recording,"I bought this just out of curiosity. The opera itself is quite good; mostly ensemble singing. It turns out to be quite old recording, although the CD came out in 2003. The recording quality is not good; the CD sounds no better than the audio samples you can listen to. Just be aware of this; although it was annoying I kept the CD anyway because I like the music."
1,No libretto,No libretto is included; a brief synopsis is provided.(just a few pointless words to satisfy the absurdly imposed minimum word requirement.)
4,Great inexpensive little stand,"For the price, this stand is great. It folds up nice and small, looks great with the blue color, and does the job nicely. It does have a bit of play and wobble but this is acceptable. I would give it 5 stars if they made it more sturdy.It has plenty of adjustability and looks great in my studio. I only use it with a few sheets at a time. It would not hold heavier books well and shouldn't be purchased if you want to put a lot on it.The paint is holding up nicely, but I don't transport it very much. I would imagine that if I was folding it up and carrying it around frequently, the paint would be scratched and flaking in places after a while. But hey, it's cheap! Also, where else can you get stands in these colors?The bag is cheap vinyl, but that is expected."
4,Fun prop,"Product arrived quickly and without damage. It looks great, although I wish it rotated a litte more freely (it's GOOD!!!!!!, but could be smoother and there's no way to get into it to lubricate)."
5,amber,"This was so easy to install I actully was able to do it myself. Looks great on my truck and others get a big kick out of if going down the road. Love the product, and the fast shippment.thanksamber"
1,cheap and cheesy,So disappointed; unbelievably cheap and stupid looking - don't bother with this product ; looks and feels like a child's toy
4,UNZIP & UNLEASH,THE TITLE SAYS IT ALL. THESE VIXENS ARE TOTALLY NUDE.MISSYAND TAMMY ARE SEXXXY. SO UNZIP AND UNLEASH.THIS IS GREAT FOR ANYTRUE WRESTLING FAN. ENJOY
5,Compatible with the Pentax K10D DSLR,"The Wireless Remote Control E will also work just fine with the K10D, and likely other similar Pentax DSLR's as well. Of course, the smaller button for zooming (a feature limited mainly to P&S cameras with built-in lenses and electronic zooming) has no effect on the K10D, but the primary shutter release button works exactly the same as that on the Pentax Remote Control F. The two remotes are the same size and either will fit into the (BG2) battery grip for the K10D. They're also cosmetically identical except for the smaller zoom button."
5,Works Great,"I bought this to use with my Pentax ZX-7, and even though it's not specifically labelled for the ZX-7, it works fine."
4,Works! (with my Optio A20),"I won't give it 5 stars because it's just a remote. It does work exactly as it should and it's a must have for taking your own pictures when out on vacation.I use it in conjunction with a gorillapod (awesome tripod): http://www.amazon.com/Joby-GP2-00EN-Gorillapod-Flexible-Digital/dp/B000HAVVFG/ref=pd_bbs_sr_3?ie=UTF8&s;=electronics&qid;=1206992495&sr;=8-3I never need to ask someone to take our pictures for us - set up the gorillapod virtually anywhere & on anyTHING, use the remote to snap a picture.One note on the Optio A20 - You have to enable the remote functionality on the camera itself by pressing UP on the directional arrows and then choosing either ""Drive Mode Remote Control"" (3 second delayed timer or ""Drive Mode 0 Second Remote Control"""
1,Confusing info,"Canon ink cartridges are the best for Canon printers, but Amazon should provide better information about the compatibility of the printers and ink tanks they sell. I bought a Canon i850 photo printer from Amazon and these BCI-3E Photo Ink Tanks are NOT compatible while the BCI-3E Color Ink Tanks (ASIN: B00004U8RN) ARE compatible. Yes, both are called BCI-3E. Go figure. I ordered the wrong ones and had to return them. I suggest being very careful before you order or buy them from somewhere else where you get better information about compatibility."
2,Great if it's not kept under the sun,I had the kittywalk outside and the sun destroyed it within a few months. I bought it for my 2 cats so they could spend some time outside but it's definitely not weather proof. They should change the material so it lasts longer than a few months after all I spent $250 on the whole thing. Not worth it!
5,Shredder,Thank you for the great service. This shredder is a work horse. I have forty years of paper work to get rid of and this shredder is helping me to get rid of it.
2,Design flaw,"This shredder came with a mechanical sensor rather than an electronic sensor. Therefore, you may have problem in turning the shredder on if the paper is too thin. The designer should have either use an electronic sensor or put in a ""Always"" on switch. This is a poor design."
1,Shredded my respect for Fellowes,"I purchased mine in July 2004. It was never that great. It died January 2005.Problems:- Doesn't really produce ""confetti."" You just get short strips. Still reasonably secure.- The little gizmo that is suppose to start and stop the machine when you feed paper constantly sticks, so the machine needs to be turned on and off manually. (I can do that, it's just not as advertised.)- Doesn't handle more than 3 pages very well.- Tends to be sluggish. In 6 months it went through more oil my granddad's Studebaker.- Lasted only about 6 months with modest use. I don't shred more than 15 full pages a day on average.I'll avoid Fellowes when I buy the next one."
4,1974 international scout 2,This is the first pair of mallory spark plug wires i buy. And like always Amazon has the best prices. the only bad thing about these wires are that i had to buy a speacial sprak plug wire crimper. but they work great with my mallory distributor on 1974 international scout 2 with a 345 engine.
4,Good purchase,"Although the potty is a little flimsy, it serves its purpose well. It is easy to clean and use and it can fit in my purse (with the ziploc storage case)."
1,"Terrible, useless","This seat is not only useless as it does not fit most of the toilet seats, but it is also dangerous. It slips and slides on the toilet and my son was holding himself on it not to slide off. In addition the opening is so small that the poor guy had a painful indent on his behind.At this point I dont know what the alternative is, but this is definitely NOT it."
3,"Cute, Compact But Not Overly Functional",I purchased the Sesame Street Folding Travel Potty Seat for my 3 year old daughter. She was recently potty trained and I was concerned about the sanitariness of public restrooms. Not all public restrooms have toilet seat covers. I thought that this would be compact enough to fit in my diaper bag; which it is. I also thought that she would find the Sesame Street characters fun; which she did. The downfall is that the folding potty seat does not fit very well on the toilet. It slides around and is not very stable. It passes as useable but I wish it sat and stayed in place a little better.
1,This Seat Doesn't Fit Public Toilets,"My daughter is 2 & weighs 37lbs. This seat fits very few public toilets. My daughter cries when she sits on this seat when we're out. It slips, slides & altogther does not give her the feeling of stability that she is used to at home. Most public toilets are elongated and this seat just doesn't fit properly on them."
1,Dangerous! Totally disgusted.,"I dont know how the people who like this thing got it to work but my son hates it and won't go near sitting on it. Its too unstable for him, slides on the seat and doesnt fit even our own home toilet. There are no grips of any kind on the bottom so its straight, smooth plastic on porcelain which presents a severe danger to any child trying to use it. The flexibility is great for travel but it gives under my son's weight before he even hit thirty pounds and that freaked him out so bad he started yelling, 'no, no, no!' It was ridiculous. I ended up having to get an extra of his padded 'ducky' seat from WalMart to stuff in his backpack to drag around with us. Less convenient but a million times safer and he'll actually use it. Would never buy this again!"
2,Good idea but poor quality,"I was very excited about this potty seat. I thought it would help my daughter with her fear of public toliets. But it almost made it worse. This seat is very flimsy. It bends under her weight (she's 33 pounds), which scares her of course. It also slides around and doesn't fit oblong seats at all. If you move it towards the front like I saw some reviews suggested, your child will wet their pants because it puts them to close to the rim of the toliet. Not a good investment, stick with the old fashioned cushioned rings. I keep it in a big zip loc bag and wipe it down with handi wipes after each use! She is now not afraid to use the ""big store potty""."
2,Sesame Street Seat,"The fact that this potty seat folds up and can be taken anywhere in a diaper bag is great. The down side is that the seat slides back and forth, into the toilet, and has my daughter scared to use this particular potty seat even at home. I would not recommend it."
2,Too tipsy,"I have to agree with others, it isn't very strong. My daughter was excited about the print on the seat, but as soon as we used it out in a public bathroom, she wasn't very happy. It isn't sturdy enough and she wanted off before her business was done. I have decided to put this one away and maybe for the next one we can use it. I recommend the more sturdier ones, but they don't fold up as Convenient as this one. **** I finally found a folding cushy potty seat on another website for $15.00, and I like it much better.** **Look at 2nd picture (not purple one) this is the potty seat I am writing this review about, not sure how this purple one comes up?"
3,Good Idea... Inconvienient,I bought this for my two year old son. He's pretty small for his age and his little butt is almost too small for the hole in the seat. He loved the pattern and wanted to use it at home but then soon preferred the softer seat we have over this one. As far as using it on trips... it doesn't fit very well on elongated toilet seats and it is a pain to clean in a public restroom with a toddler at your side. Lucky for us my son rarely has to go #2 while we're out so I usually just have him stand on the regular seat and use it like a urinal. It saves us time and I don't have to worry about him putting his hands all over the dirty seat.
1,Terrible...,"Doesn't fit any toilet we came across, slides all over, almost made my son fall in, and even pinched some people's kids... Not worth the plastic it's made with..."
1,this seat is unsafe,I bought this foldable potty seat for my daughter who is 2 and showed an interest in potty training right before her second birthday. She loves sesame street and elmo inparticular. This seat does not fit on any potty seat in a public bathroom or a regular toilet for that matter. I used it more recently at a friends house actually today and she almost fell into my friends toilet. The seat which has things on the bottom to keep it from slipping do not work. As soon as i can find the receipt it is going back.
3,Not as described,"Item is not the same color as pictured. Also, advertised that came with bag, but bag is just a flimsy packaging bag...not what I expected."
1,I saved my kid from falling in the toliet with this,"I got mine at Target, (new Item) but it's the same kind of travel seat. It is very unstable and collapses your kid right into the toilet! Luckily I had my hands on her but can't say for sure she didn't get some gross public toilet water on her! EWWWW! just go to Babies R Us and buy the travel potty they make in New Orleans...a little bit bigger, but so sturdy and can also set it up on the grass or side of road in a bind!"
2,"too weak, my two year old son broke it!","I like the idea of this foldable and portable toilet seat. its slips in any of the bags i use. Also it was very appealing to my son, with all the sesame street characters on it, during his potty training period. However it broke very easily after just a few times of using it. My son loved it for it had elmo on it, so he would take it out of his bag and play with it and then it was an easy job for him to bring it apart. i was soooo sad but never thought of buying it again!"
5,Works just fine,"After purchasing the Dora soft potty seat and tossing it out for safety reasons, I bought this one for my kid and I love it. The bonus is that you can take it EVERYWHERE. Easy to clean, easy to put away. A good purchase."
4,Great for potty training.,This product is wonderful for potty training outside of the house. I was always putting my daughter in pull-ups becuase I was afraid to sit her on a public toilet seat. Now she can use the potty anywhere. I take her wipes and some anitbacterial wipes and her potty seat everywhere with us and potty training has been so much easier now.
3,not perfect - works for us,"I was frustrated with this seat when I first started using it for my daughter. It took some getting used to lining up the seat so that the rubber grips would keep it from sliding. Once we figured that out, it's worked great and for a long time my daughter preferred it to her on the floor potty at home. I found that it works better a long narrow toilet seat which probably keeps it from giving as much as on a wider, rounder seat. Also, my daughter is only 25lbs. So for us, it works great for trips to the store."
3,The seat works but is not very sturdy,"Our daughter uses this seat with a little hesitation. Our daughter is nowhere near the 40 pound limit and causes the seat to bend. I have no fear of it actually breaking but it is enough to scare her. The characters on it helped us convince her to use it. Once over her initial fears, we used the seat with success. We are currently exploring the idea of trying the heavier duty cushoned folding seats. This seat is ideal for limited use with restricted storage space."
1,My son fell too!,My son also broke the seat and fell in. He is 2 and a half. It also didn't seem to sit very securely on any toilet we put it on. He needed to have me sit him on it. It wouldn't have been good for pooping. I wouldn't recommend this product. We switched to using a cushie tushie potty ring. We just carry a bag large enough to hold it. He is much more comfortable and secure. I think he also likes the fact that it is the same one he uses at home.
1,Not sturdy at all,"We bought this traveling potty just in case my son needed to use the bathroom while we were out. He's only 30lbs and when I put him on this seat, it looked like the thing was going to break. He refuses to use it and I don't blame him! It's a good concept, but the seat bends and looks like the hinges will break with even a skinny kid sitting on it. I don't recommend this item for anyone!"
2,Not so great,I had similar problems; most specifically my little one complained of the seat pinching her legs when she sat on it. Think we'll try something else.
1,Not suggested,"I purchased one a month ago for my 34 month old son to be able to potty train when we are in public, as he is scared of ""full"" size toilet seats. My son weighs 23 pounds. I have used this item ONCE and consider it to be wasted money. As I placed him on it, I found myself holding up the back of the seat at the fold as it looked like it was going to fold-up on him. I have no plans on using this again and if it wasn't a ""toilet"" item I would love to return it for my money back!"
2,Go With The Primo,"We inherited this seat from a friend as we started to potty train our son. Not only does it bend when my 26 lb son sits on it but if he shifts his weight or leans to one side the seat jumps and moves. This seat really made him feel uneasy. We bought the Primo seat after we read the reviews and have used it constantly for the last month. I would give it 5 stars. Not only is it sturdy but it stays in place. The seams are not flat like this seat with big bird so be careful if you like to slide your child's bottom all over it but I feel there is no real threat using the primo. I also believe that's what makes the primo so much sturdier. Good Luck! BTW we have used the primo everywhere: Planes, Porter potty, mall... and so on it works great EVERYWHERE."
1,"Travels well, functions poorly.","I bought this item based on a recommendation by my sister-in-law, and I now regret listening to her. This seat is great in that it is compact enough to fit into a diaper bag for travel, but other than that, it's worthless.This is not a reliable product to use if you have a squirmy, fidgety, potty trainer (and what child isn't?). The seat does not stay in place. It slips and slides all over the place and doesn't even fit properly on any toilet that I've tried it on. We have this seat in our downstairs bathroom for my 3-year-old son, and he has fallen in the toilet and had his butt pinched so many times that he now refuses to use it!"
2,Almost fell in!,This seat seems to work fine on home toilets (such as traveling to a relatives house). When we used it on a vacation in the hotel toilet and public restroom it did not fit and started to buckle (there was not enough support in the back to support my sons weight). It scared him and caused him to have a setback in his potty training.
1,"Good Idea, Bad Product!!!!","I found this for cheap at a local store, and decided to get it for home and travel. My twin girls (18 months) are a little weary of the toilet already, and I know if I tried to put them on this thing, it would ruin any progress we've made. It is totally flimsy, and unstable on our toilet (elongated seat). It does not cover the whole seat, and it doesn't attach to the toilet in any way. When I set it on the seat to fit it, it ended up falling in! Not only that, but it looks like it the hinges would pinch little thighs. I threw it in the trash and bought the baby bjorn potty seat-- it is so stable and comfortable for my girls. I would advise anyone to spend the extra $$ and get a decent potty seat, as this thing is a total waste of money!!!"
1,not very pleased,The potty seat is an odd shape and does not fit any toilet well.I would not reccomend.
2,Not great,"This seat scores high on portablity, I haven't experinced the problems with slipping and my daughter loves it. HOWEVER, if she's not perfectly positioned on it she does pee on the seat itself, which then ends up on the floor. I think there must be better products out there!"
3,not sure haven't used it a ton,"I haven't used it a ton but my son seems unstable, uncomfortable on it. He doesn't like to sit on it long. great idea and good for keeping in the diaper bag and will work for stores."
1,"Not a good quality product, not even usable quality.","I bought it and returned it the same day. Very flimsy. The joints bend backwards when the kid is sitting on it. My 2 year old is underweight (in 10 percentile). I was scared it will break and will frighten her. The seat was also slipping all over the place even though it has rubber padding on the bottom, but they are too small to be of any use."
1,Not sturdy. child risk is too high,"i returned this immediately after two uses. It slips and slides. I was trying to hold my son AND the potty to keep him from falling and the potty from slipping. Regardless, my son still almost fell into the toilet. Smh.."
1,low rent UFO book,"My girlfriend got me this book because she knows I'm into the subjects of UFO's, conspiracy, occult etc... I fully believe in life on other planets, possibly even within our galaxy. But this book is a bunch of trash. George's recollections are the stuff of new age, delusional fantasy. Honestly I've never been able to finnish the book because the writing is so transparent and bad. He even gives the aliens Dungeons and Dragons worthy names like Orthon, Zuhl, and Firkon.His descriptons of the Aliens stem from what I can only describe as a Utopian, Gumby-era idealism. Every sentence in this book reeks of fake. I actually feel insulted while I read it. The only reason I've read as much as I have is because I put it in my bathroom. As to why he wrote this book, and what his intentions were, I really have no idea except that perhaps he is a crackpot."
3,A fascinating peek into the life of the credulous,"This was interesting in its detail, but not terribly difficult, I felt, to separate fact (none) from fiction. ""Professor"" Adamski's claims that these people hailed from Venus seems incredible in light of the 900 degree surface temperature of that planet.It is an interesting read for the budding skeptic, as it has plenty of opportunity for critical thought exercise."
1,Fake!,"I remember having read Mr. Adamski's first book, in 1959, ""Flying Saucers Have Landed"", in which he writes that there were teeming cities on the other side of the moon... Ok... He was a hoaxer then, and still is a fake, today!"
3,It's a textbook,"I know that textbooks do not read like adventure novels, but I had a hard time getting through these boring chapters. There is some good and useful information included, but there are also many suggestions that I disagree with. I found myself wondering if the authors have ever stepped foot into a high school classroom anytime in the past ten years. Many of the lesson suggestions for high schoolers would never work in my setting; however, they may work for other people. Others may find the book very useful, but it just wasn't for me."
4,urban teaching,"This book gives a good overview of strategies and understanding for urban teaching. The book covers expectations, controlling behavior, goal planning, self-change, and understanding to higher achievement. As a new teacher this book is helpful to gain insight on child behavior and on urban school environments."
5,A Glance at the Life of the Holy Prophet of Islam,"The book starts with a look at the pre-Islamic world order. It deals with not only the events that occurred during the life of the Prophet, but also the philosophy and thinking behind the Prophet's actions. This is a great book to read for those interested in an introductory guide to the life of the Prophet."
2,Questionable Value,Clearly a professional would not purchase this 'professional quality' mandoline. Four pieces of plastic and 3 blades. No stand. Julienne blade was miscut and 3 tines bent back on first use. Small thumbscrews not for arthritis. No storage space for extra blade. Poor documentation on use - in particular no instructions on techniques to use safely. I can't understand prior high ratings.
4,"4 stars with a BUT,","The Matfer mandolines are great products. I got mine as a gift and cautiosly love it. The Blade is VERY sharp. You want that to slice things like kiwi or tomato without making mush. You can use the holder to hold your produce when you slice it for everything BUT waffle cut. For that you must cut once then turn the cut object and cut again. After the first cut, it is too small to use the holder, so you use a flat hand. Not my hand with that sharp blade."
5,"MATURITY, PATIENCE AND BELIEVING IN YOURSELF","Mark Cramer instructs the reader about the development of a professional horseplayer in SCARED MONEY. Through the fictional device of a character named Matt, who is a jazz musician as well as a horseplayer, he shows the psychological struggle often required to be a professional. The book contains a few tips on picking horses, but mostly it contains tips on how to be a serious horseplayer. SCARED MONEY, which seems almost autobiographical, is a series of stories about dealing with the biggest opponent of all: yourself. In a way, Mr. Cramer's book is a larger lesson in Life, where maturity, patience and believing in yourself are ultimate values. SCARED MONEY would make a great gift for a horseplaying friend or family member."
2,mediocre,"book is mediocre and boring, sorry not help to a serious handicapper at all. Even as a story, repetitive, first year college level writing"
4,spotty but often brilliant,"for several months now its been my first choice on the ipod. 40 songs here, about half of them are addictive, but there's a lot of weaker stuff that has to be skipped over. i think its one of nelson's best albums, which is saying a lot. (for calibration: After the Satellite Sings is Nelson's best album, Electrical Language his best song)."
4,Bill Nelson's Whimsical Wall of Sound,"The ever-prolific Mr Nelson's latest album is a magical selection of songs. Following on from the vast 6 CD Noise Candy release comes Whimsy. Recorded in Bill's digitally upgraded home studio it is a bright and breezy 2CD collection of 40 tracks. There's so much going on in each track that, at first, it's a little hard to take it all in. Multiple Keyboards and Guitars fly around Bill's vocals and samples and initially it can make your head spin. On subsequent listens however it all sinks in. From the beauty of songs like 'Slumberlite' and 'Here We Go', through the fun of 'Magnetism Made Me Do It' and 'The Fundamental Blues', all the way to the epic 'Over the Moon' and final cool instrumental 'Close Your Eyes'. This is a great collection of whimsical summery sounds. Nothing too serious here and that's fine by me."
3,Quit dreaming and get on the beam Bill,"Was nice to see Mr. Nelson's product back in the racks of the local record store. I picked up this double CD and wondered if I would find the usual musical noodlings or something more essential. Alas, it's a collection of the former rather than the latter. No real surprises here. Pretty sounds but nothing that really grabs you.I wish Bill would piece back together his 'Red Noise' incarnation, hit the road and then record a follow up to 'Sound on Sound' which for me remains his defining edgy masterpiece."
1,Skeletons of a former time,"In this case the picture on the cover is not worthy of the content. Pegasus would generally mean a flight of fancy, of high artistic imagination set against the pale skyline of banal consumer shlock... But there is no treasure here nor under the technicolour overcoat of Long John Silver or Bill Nelson. Perhaps Pegasus is really parrot Polly that repeats ad nauseum the same old musical formulas to the devote. If anybody digs through the 2 CD set expecting to find the new bold approach, they may as well keep digging to China -- at least they may find some new music there. The point is old Long John is leaning too heavily on his musical crutch and Polly doesn't have the wings to fly beyond what had been done long before."
4,Great for student research,"Well organized, from the definition of sunflower right through the life cycle, this book thoroughly covers the growth of the sunflower plant. Vocabulary words are boldly highlighted and explained in context, as well as in the accompanying glossary. Captions supplement each photograph. Plant part, pest, and pollination questions are asked and answered. This book would be a valuable resource to primary students conducting research on the life cycle of plants, particularly the sunflower."
1,This vendor is not an authorized distributor of this bag,"I purchased a bag from this vendor, thinking that by being affiliated with Amazon that they were legit.I got the bag and thought it looked fake. The vendor told me to take it to the nearest boutique.The boutique confirmed that it was NOT authentic, so I am returning the bag I got from Moda Party and feel cheated by the high price paid for a phoney, unauthentic bag."
1,Fake?,Shouldn't Amazon address this in some way? If it is real I would buy it; if it is fake (and the previous poster certainly seems right on that score) shouldn't this be off Amazon's site? I think it becomes an issue of Amazon's credibility...
4,Good value,"I bought this amp for my 4 speakers and 2 tweeters to get a louder sound to overcome the road noise in summer months with windows down. The sound quality is okay until you really crank it up, it doesnt get distorted at max input level for me but at high volume the highs become too overpowering and just sounds unbalanced. For the rated wattage it really isn't much louder than my Kenwood head unit alone which is 22W x 4 RMS. Since I installed separate tweeters up front and bypassed my car's stock amp, I find the head unit sounds better than this amp and overcomes the road noise without losing sound quality. I decided to use this amp to replace my outdated Optimus amp for my 2 subs and really think this is a much better use for it especially with the built-in crossover and bass equalizer. Made my subs sound much better. Overall the amp is a good buy for the price and I am sure sounds better than most stock systems but if you have an aftermarket head unit-it may sound better than this amp."
1,Great amp!,"I purchased this amp after reviewing the specs and comparing it to other similar amps. For the price, this amp is a great value. It was easy to install and all of the switches/adjustments are clearly marked. I've had this amp for over a month and it performs very well. I liked the ability to use it as a 2 OR 3 OR 4 channel amp and it is bridgeable.I would highly recommend this product."
4,thorough but lacking,"The NFT is full of useful maps and some useful info. But I am dissapointed by the icons used to show location on the maps. It is sometimes difficult to figure out where things are based on the icons because they are not numbered and there are often 15 coffee shops on one map. Also, some of the useful info that is included is not so useful. I called the five cab services reccommended for airport rides and all of them were outrageously priced, and one of them was a restaurant, so I ended up finding a cab with my own research. I am also dissappointed by the fact that it lists all the Dunkin Donuts and McDonalds but leaves off some of the cities best independent stores, which I would think would be what Not-For-Tourists guide would be focused on. It's good to have, but not extensive."
3,Hard to understand,"I really think this book is valuable, and I heard so many great things about it before hand, I guess I expected something a little different. The good thing about this book is that it does have valuable information in it. Unfortunately, the system only uses a general icon to show you the information. This creates a problem when you want to actually go the bank, restaurant, or whatever because you can't tell which icon represents which location you want to go to. I wish they had used a number or letter system along with the icons.Also, the binding on the book fell to pieces immediately. Cheap glue?"
1,Disappointed--it's old!,"What a disappointment! It was listed as the most recent book, yet when my daughter began her term at UIC (U of I at Chicago) they were using the 2008 book! Boo hoo!"
4,Shepard2000,"Nice sound, changed headphones for upgraded sound. Eates up battery time when using the anti-skip function and other accouterments. Make sure player is off anti-skip function when you can get away with it; otherwise look you 6 hrs of play otherwise 8 hrs max. Resists almost no bumps w./ out anti-skip; resists most w./ anti-skip. AC Adapter nice feature, cassette adapter nice for those with cassette decks in car or older non cd player boomboxes. Auto off nice, remember to hit stop forget pausebut a battery charger like a computer would be nicer."
1,Dead after 1 month,"I bought this CD player for my daughter's birthday, and, only 4 weeks later, it's completely dead. I've replaced the batteries, checked all the external connections, and even tried the AC adapter. This is the worst product I have ever seen. NO tech support. NO return policy, or repair places mentioned on-line. Hell, even the product itself isn't on the KOSS website. I'll never buy KOSS again."
2,It looks cool and that's about it!,Bought it. Played one CD then it broke.Sent it back and got another 3 weeks later. I hope this one works.Go Sony!
2,Okay...but...,"I bought this cdplayer with carkit about a year ago and some months, summer of 2000. It worked great the first few months/weeks, but then the buttons just started going wierd on me, and not functioning correctly. Maybe there was a cross of information, because the back track button actually plays forward, and yeah...And then about a week or so ago the thing just started skipping after 17secs worth of playing on any song/track.Given, the cd player has lasted for so long, its a nice buy. But if youre looking for a long lasting investment, i suggest that you take your money else where. spend that extra buck and buy sony, or something."
3,Think of it as a one-year rental,"The player worked great for about a year. A few weeks ago the buttons started having a mind of their own: pressing 'forward' sometimes turns on 'repeat' or 'shuffle', pressing 'stop' usually makes it go back one track so I have to press stop four or five times before it actually stops. I had to replace the cassette adapter after a couple of months, but overall it has been worth the $30 for a year's use."
3,Buyer Beware....,"Beware if you purchase this product....you'll need to purchase another one pretty soon! Koss products do not last. I have to say...this one has superior sound quality and does not drain the battery too quickly....that is if the anti-skip is off. I bought this discman about a year ago...and 3 or 4 months ago it started acting up.....will not fast forward or rewind correctly within a track....will not go to the track you want it to go to....will sometimes shut off for no apparent reason. Sure, it's a good price...but I recommend investing your money in something better....Sony, Panasonic, etc."
2,Good for a portable - but can't push a larger system,"I saw a lot of good reviews for this item, the price was right so I tried it out. It took about 5 minutes to determine this player was no match for the Sony Discman I was replacing. It just can't push the way my old unit did. Will keep searching for a better product that fits my needs."
5,Cool,I MAY BE ONLY 12 BUT I'VE HAD ALOT OF CD PLAYERS(ALL VERY EXPENSIVE BUT THIS WAS CHEP! ) IT NEVER SKIPS THE SOUNDS GREAT I'M LISTENING TO JESSICA SIPMSON RIGHT NOW AND THE SOUNDS ARE ALL SMOOTH INSTED OF CUT UP INTO WEIRD SOUNDS BUY IT!
5,Totally awesome!!,"This CD Player is worth every cent. When I first ordered it I thought I was going to get one of those huge portables like you see at Wal-Mart. But I was surprised to find out that this is a very compact CD player. It looks great and sounds just awesome. With the Anti-skip on it never misses, ever. I would definately get another. It is by far the best deal I've found for the most output. Headphones are okay, might consider upgrading."
1,Bad shipment?,"I bought it in early September. The anti-shock mechanism did not work properly, gave static most of the time. I exchanged it. The new one seemed to work well. After a week, it simply stopped working (changed batteries, plugged it to DC, etc..), nothing. Today, it is working again...I noticed that most of the negative feedback comes from people who bought in September and October, so I wonder if a whole lot may be deffective? Still have not decide what to do next. Would not recommend it."
5,It's GGGGGGRREEEAAAAAAAAAATTTTTT,This thing is great. It even comes with a car adapter...the antiskip works. I had the thing for 2 hours and already love it. The only Problem is that the door slams shut pretty hard when you close it.
4,Very Good Cd for price,"This cd is a great deal for the price. I would have given it five stars, but the head phones are a poor quality. I recommend if you buy this item you buy a seperate pair of headphones from the accessory list."
5,GOOD PRICE...GOOD SOUND...GOOD LOOKING,"This is an excellent CD player for the money. It is a trim, good looking unit with very decent sound quality. The car pack is an added bonus. The bass boost is great, but when using it in the car with the car pak, you may need to turn down the bass boost to avoid distortion of sound. The sound is otherwise pure and clear.I know that some reviewers have complained about battery drain, but I play it for hours on the batteries and have yet to need to replace them. The cd player is easy to open and the cd pops right in effortlessly. The headphones are comfortable, and the anti-skip mechanism works like a dream. I have had no trouble with the unit, and I absolutely love it!"
3,... interesting concept and great acting ...,"JGL usually plays edgy roles and he plays those VERY well. Therefore I picked the movie and I am not disappointed in his performance or that of his partner in this movie. It's a nice slow Sunday night movie - if you are into NYC on a sunny day and if you like edgy movies. I totally liked the music / sound - very spacee.If you like French movies, you might like this one too. Tons of feelings - good and sad, a mixture of Momento and Run-Lola-Run. EDGY."
3,A decent beginning for an uneven series,"The first book in the Sword of the Spirits trilogy, which is IMO stronger than the more famous Tripods series--better concept, better (particularly female) characters, better plot twists--but, paradoxically, no single book in this trilogy is as strong as the individual books in that series. It really feels like the author had an excellent idea, got it two-thirds of the way figured out, and went with the incomplete result. Go ahead and read the series, but be prepared for the high point coming from book two, not the ending."
4,A stirring fantasy novel based in post-apocolyptic England.,"The first book in the sword of the spirits trilogy, this novel portrays a young man, and his journey, which unexpectedly leads him to become a prince. This stunning novel introduces you to the second iron age, after an apocolypse. In the tradition of other writings by John Christopher, this story can be appreciated on many levels"
2,"The trilogy starts bravely, but the last book craters ...","For 1972 it isn't bad, but the downsided ending offerring only the hope of commercial conquest and a rather trite ""I shall have no son"" (because I am a twit) for the conclusion, brings it to a sorry close.The series either needs a fourth book or a rewrite of the ending with a better editor."
5,Represent Yourself In Court: How to Prepare & Try a Winning Case (Represent Yourself in Court),This book is amazing! You won't need a lawyer after you read this and it will save you time and money.
3,About the history of the Roosevelt Family,The best part of this book are the first chapters. Besides being a small biography on Theodore and Franklin Roosevelt Churchill also writes about the Roosevelts as they came from Holland to New Amsterdam in the early 17th century and how the 7 generations afterwards made their way into American political and economic life.There is not a lot of depth in this book but it is wort reading if you are interested in the Roosevelts before Theodore.
1,Totaly Useless,"Hoping to gain additional skills to deal with complexity of Oracle8 databases. Well, this book is a collections of bits of information from Oracle Support database that can be found on the Support WebSite. Most of scripts that are provided with this book are outdated, most go back to 1993-96 v6 and v7 of Oracle. It seems that the book was done in a rush and has very little value to any Oracle DBA with 2+ years of experience. Would not recomment to waist your money on it!"
4,Not bad,"I found this book to be good for someone who is not totally new to Oracle, however is not all that experienced either. If you have about a year's worth of experience and would like to learn more about how to solve common problem's, this book is a good choice."
1,Very poor book,"As an Oracle dba, I found this book to be of little, if any, value. I suggest you try to find a copy in a bookstore and look it over before you buy it. Unless the Oracle Applications section of the book is helpful (my company doesn't use the product, so I skipped this section), I can't imagine who would actually use the material in this book."
1,A BOOK THAT BEATS TOO MUCH AROUND THE BUSH,"THIS BOOK DOES NOT GIVE CONCISE AND TO THE POINT ADVICE ON VARIOUS PROBLEMS WITH ORACLE 8. TOO MUCH USELESS INFORMATION, WHICH MAKES FINDING SOLUTIONS TO VARIOUS PROBLEMS WITH ORACLE 8 HARD. THE BOOK WAS ACTUALLY SUPPOSE TO BE WRITTEN AS A FILM STORY, BUT FORTUNATELY, HE MIXED SHOOTING WITH TROUBLESHOOTING AND AFTER THAT, HE ADDED ORACLE 8, WHICH BECOMES ORACLE 8 TROUBLESHOOTING. THE AUTHOR NEEDS TO HIRE A GARDNER AND TRIM THE BUSH."
1,Don't Waste Your Money on This Book,"If you have any knowledge of Vegas, don't waste your money on this book. If you are looking for a book that will tell you the best places to stay with kids, or restaurants to go to, or activities to do, like I was, -- again don't waste your money on this book.Instead of giving the reader a list of best hotels, restaurants, etc. it has something good to say about every place. Every hotel reads like a page out of the hotel brochure. I was thouroughly disapointed. I can honestly say I did not learn one thing from this rather short and dry book.Also, watch some Travel channel specials.If you need a book, the best I have read so far has been""The Unofficial Guide to Las Vegas"""
5,Have Kids? Highly Recommend This Book !!,"Can't say it enough. If you have kids, this book is a must have. Everything to do and see, locations, prices - it's all here. I let the kids choose what they wanted, mapped it out, and we're on our way. For kids of all ages!!"
3,"A bit disconnected, difficult to stay with...","This is my first Susan Andersen book, I think I'll try her others... I thought her leading man (Beau) was lacking, and personally can do without the ""F-word"" in romance writing. Steamy is good (especially in New Orleans) but does he have to throw the word around as much as he does? I thought the character development was weak, the development of intrigue very slow. (Read a Sandra Brown or two and you'll understand what I mean.) I quit reading this book two-thirds of the way through. (Not like me at all!) I hope her other titles are more enjoyable!"
2,Humor doesn't work,Susan Anderson's first book was fun and fresh. In this book she had to try to hard and it shows. The awkward dialect doesn't help.
1,Where is the plot?,"Having read all of Susan Andersen's books, I was greatly disappointed in this one. Susan has written great romantic suspense in the past--Exposure, On Thin Ice, Present Danger. All are worth rereading. This one wasn't worth finishing. There is no suspense, no romance, just ""cute"" sexual byplay. Hot or not, it's not a book I'd recommend."
2,Definitely not her best...,"I know that this author's romantic thrillers are weak in the thriller department, but this book was even worse than normal. The mystery plot was laughable. I also didn't find the hero, Beau, very appealing. He was always sloppy and unshaven and seemed like a slob. What Juliet would see in him was beyond me. And, once again, the author gave Beau a ridiculously exaggerated accent (at least he didn't say ""cher"" all the time!)Actually, all the main characters were two-dimensional caricatures. No depth to them at all. If you don't read this one, you aren't missing a thing."
2,NOT HER BEST!!,"I absolutly loved All Shook Up by Susan Andersen but this book doesn't even come close. Susan needs to stick to her local of Washington state and stay away from the South. The southern New Orleans dialect about drove me crazy, I could hardly understand what they were saying most of the time.Also, the story is really lame with the secondary characters, actually kind of stupid to think about it. I found myself skipping through alot of the book just to get back to the two main characters and their relationship.It's an okay read, but would recommend her other books over this one."
1,Mr.Good Old Boy Meets Ms. Straitlaced,"This book reminded me of so many others. I can handle bad boys, but good old boys are beyond redemption. Then there's the preacher's daughter, no I mean the spinster schoolteacher. I know she was neither of those, but you get my drift. Just did not like book, characters, and what was that plot?"
4,It was a fun and romantic book to read!,It was a feel-good book that was a lot of fun. You can feel yourself get attached to the characters as you read.
3,Not As Good As BIY,"I loved ""Baby, I'm Yours,"" so I couldn't wait to read Be My Baby. Well, it's pretty good, but neither of the leading characters were very appealing. Beau, in particular, was just too much of a Neandrethal for my taste. I did enjoy some of the minor characters, but no one was as developed as in BIY. The pace was fast, but at the expense of quality. I will continue to read this author, but this book is not a keeper."
5,Wow!,"""Be My Baby"" is the first book that I have read by Susan Andersen. It was HOT from beginning to end. I could not put it down. If you like steamy romance you have to read this book."
5,GREAT! HOT! STEAMY! A KEEPER FOR SURE!,"I read ""Baby I'm yours"" and decided then that I loved Susan Anderson's writing and that she would join my small group of authors that I consider good enough to keep in my library.There are some writers out there that have a natural sense of what readers want and they make reading FUN. Ms. Anderson is one of those writers.""Be my baby"" kept me entertained from the first page to the last.I hope that she keeps up the good work because she is one author that I will continue to buy her books.If you happen to read this Ms. Anderson please don't change a thing."
3,Not Andersen's best,"After receiving a threatening letter, prim and proper Boston heiress Juliet Rose Astor Lowell's father demands that while in New Orleans on business she must have police supervision.Not at all thrilled with his job of babysitting a rich miss, Police Sargeant Beau Dupree does all he can to try to convince Juliet that he isn't the man for the job, the problem is, she's enjoying her visits to the taudy strip clubs and car chases. The Sweet Miss has a yearning for adventure.Juliet and Beau clash like firecrackers but they must stick together after several attempts on Juliet's life. The attraction to eachother is undeniable and eventually the bodyguard and Miss Priss are falling head over heels in love.This is the third book I've read by Ms. Andersen, but the least liked. I loved both Exposure and Baby Be Mine, but this one wasn't as much of a hit. Interesting read though and the New Orleans setting is sure to please."
4,Appeal is a Perfect Title...........,"Appeal is a perfect title for this collection of images of young male models that are just coming into adulthood. These young men are very handsome, erotic, and innocent looking all at the same time. The images are not pornographic in any way, meaning no frontal nudity. They are images of very happy and smiling young men who love to act-out in front of the camera. These shots taken by this young good-looking photographer are of youths he discovered in clubs, on the streets, or at the beach. Horvath has a way of knowing when to snap a photo; when the lighting is perfect and the shadows cast the perfect mood. Most of these black & white and color shots of various sizes are taken outdoors.This is a collection of beautiful images from a new talented photographer that are very appealing. I look forward to Volume 2, and I know I will not be disappointed if it is anything like his first volume. Perfect!Joe Hanssen"
4,Like Admiring An Ice Sculpture,"I got this CD as part of a lot recently, and it is very exquisite. Exquisitely chilly that is. These are such refined and ice-cold performances that it really is phenomenal for the feeling. I heard a number the Alberni's lps in the past of all sorts of repertoire on CRD, but this is later. Here they have refined their approach into something like a perfect ice-sculpture, or that old discarded Olympics sport of ice skaters tracing figures on the ice. It is quite beautiful in its way, and here it is really quite lovely, but still like the lost Olympic sport, one is moved to ask ....why?? Why perform Mozart in such a chilly way?? But if one loves these works, any solid and coherent interpretation is worth hearing. In addition, the cellist has about the best intonation of any cellist I have ever heard play these works. Some of the cello- lines I almost felt I was hearing for the first time!"
4,Good overview on the climbing in europe,"I used this book for planning a European climbing trip, and it was a really good resource. However when I got to each of the places I ended up buying the crag specific guide books, lot more detail and routes that where not covered in this book. I did use this book a lot for information on places to stay / camp which was nice. Another nice bonus is that this is all in English, some of the guide books I bought on the trip where not, good for topos but I used this book for approach descriptions."
2,I'm glad I bought this used,"I was really dissappointed with this book. The cover page seemed to suggest it was about women who had been forced or tricked into prostitution. I found myself wondering how they felt when they found out they had been tricked. How did they end up getting out of this and putting their lives back together? These types of questions were never addressed. It was mostly dealing with the number of incidences that happen in varies countries. How the laws have changed over the years etc. It was more text book quality than I would have expected. Also, contrary to the title the vast majority of the women they mention in the book entered this life fully knowing what they were doing. Nothing was stolen from them, they gave it away. It might be a good book for a social studies discussion but not for interesting reading."
5,Great for art and dog lovers.,"Even though I own this book and keep it on my bookshelf at home, everytime I run into it at a store I always have to pick it up and look through it. Hart does it once again but this time focuses on dogs and dogs alone. He covers all dogs from the common mutt to the great English Bulldog. After you have read this book once at a library or at a store, you will have this great temptation to buy it. Once you start reading it and looking at the great pictures you will never want to put it down. Adam."
3,just pleased,"I bought this for my 12 year old daughter who loves to draw. When I saw the $240 price tag, i was thinking it was a big text. Bought it new from an alternate source on Amazon for $20, I thought it was an unbelievable deal. When I received the 64 page text, I thought, not such a great deal. We also noticed the back cover listed retail at $9.99, why is it listed for $240 on the Amazon site? The main thing is that my daughter was happy with it and is drawing great."
2,"interesting, but waste of money","the movie is supposed to teach you to play metallica, right?it is interesting to see this guy play, but he doesn't explain muchept why he's using certain guitars for different songs. It might help very advanced players, but not me. It was a waste of money."
2,Painful to watch !!,"This film is listed in some books at a ""Noir"", but I say no !It is more of a drama with way to much Barbara Stanwyck as the ultra aggressive wife married to Sterling Hayden, an everyday Joe who is a cop in LA !Having to listen to Stanwyck ramble on and on really got on my nerves and I had to shut in down about 3/4 thru the movie and still do not know how it ended !"
3,Mediocre Noir / Melodrama,"""Crime Of Passion"" is film noir mediocrity and frankly, a major disappointment. The plot just doesn't ring true and denegrades women if this film is linked to the Woman's Liberation Movement as some have suggested. Stanwick certainly goes way over the top and is supposed to be an intelligent, rational woman, but by the end of the movie has lost all sense of bearing and reality because she now lives in suburbia? Hayden is more effective and has a truly memorable scene where he ""busts"" into an office, takes a last drag on a cigarette, throws it down, and then punches out a superior. Average at best, ""Crime Of Passion"" is a mindless exercise in killing time and is really more melodrama than noir. Believe me noir fans, you can do much, much better than this."
3,TV Cart,"This product needs to have the dimenions listed, because there is no way of knowing that it is 20 1/2 tall(high) without the measurements listed. It is made for the new flat screen tv. The tv can't be over 24 inches and weigh less than 70 lbs. That's the only reason I gave it 3 stars."
2,TV Cart,"This cart is very low for a TV cart. It was sturdy enough and easy to put together, but we could not use it for the purpose for which we intended."
1,Worst floormats ever,"Seriously cute floormats for a couple months, then the little nubbins and entire backing started coming off making a gross mess right on the carpet. Funny since they are supposed to protect against mess on the carpet!! I don't know if it varies by climate but if you own these, check them for the first signs of falling apart like this and toss them in the trash early."
2,Could be better,"The ""Curious George"" design & the fabric look good but the backing on these mats is pretty flimsy. I've had them just a few days over 3 months, the nonskid bumps have rubbed off and the backing is torn apart. I'm not rough on mats or the car, the other mats these were replacing had been used for 2 years and were in good shape (I have monkey seat covers and wanted matching floor mats)."
5,A sensitive and well written semi-autobiography,"Robert Tell presents an account of his mother's slow descent intodementia and its impact on him as the only son. Although the authorsuggests this is not a ""how to"" book it definitely educates the readerabout many significant issues such as geriatricare management, drivingand preneed funeral planning--to mention a few. This book is unusal forits male (son) caregiver perspective and a must read for all who aregoing through the chalenging years of caring for an elderly parent.Although I am now an adult orphan I read the book and garnered insightsabout the journey that I and my family recently completed with thepassing of my 94 year old mother several years ago."
4,Nice cover,"I'm one of Kent's students. The introduction is perhaps the most interesting of all: this is a woman who has an intimate knowledge of the Medici. Then again, this book reads like one big Tabloid newspaper: it is a collection of gossip between the family Medici the most powerful family in Renaissance Florence. The unsinkable Cosimo d' Medici wrote volumes of personal correspondence that was never intended to see the light of day. Except this book exposes the family.It's truly a piece of humanist thinking and worth your florins"
2,The Medici again?,"As a distinguished historian of ancient science, Francesca Rochberg remarked, do we need another book on the Medici? I think not."
5,DVD,The video is ok I bought for my husband to watch while riding inside during the winter months. Enjoyed the scenery.
4,Good,"The Sedona views are nice but the Grand Canyon views are just okay, I have been there several times and I was wondering how they were going to capture the beauty of the canyon. Did not get it, long roads with no scenes, which is what it is like when you drive through the park. That's okay I can remember what it looked like. Nice try..."
1,Boring,I thought this would be an interactive ride but was saddened to hear boring music and watch a boring video.
2,? Get what you pay for.,"I specifically paid extra to order the 1993 Lippincott Edition. To get the 1989 Edition by Lea has been disappointing. Otherwise 1 week delivery time was good, but too late for me to fix this for my current university course. :-("
1,Extremely rude customer service at Ambersports,"I ordered a carrom board from Ambersports.com web site and they sent me wrong carrom board. I called them and customer service lady was extermely rude and did not accept her mistake.Later, I emailed to Amberports, this time they accepted their mistake. I replied them back asking for Refund and Return merchandise authorization. Now, it's been almost a week I did not hear back from them."
5,Best Short Stories EVER!,"Absolutely delighted with Waterman's prose - wish there were more volumes! Great bedtime reading - can read just a few pages and have delightful images to ponder, with a plot completed easily before bedtime, or can read the entire book in a sitting (recommend a great glass of wine and a fireplace in winter, or a park bench on a crisp autumn day with hot chocolate).Row 22, Seats A & B"
4,"This is a very fast reading, riveting suspense story. VG.",I read this book several years ago and made the mistake of loaning it out -- never got it back. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys suspense stories. I was thrilled when a TV movie version of this book came out. Thrilled but then disappointed. Read the book -- much better!
5,Sing a song...,"This book is a beautiful introduction to Nikki Giovanni's childrens' poetry. Each piece, written from the viewpoint of a black child, graces us with the experiences common in the life of a kid. Ranging from the childs eye view of 'Mommies' and 'Daddies' to the monsters in our dreams to the invincibility of youth, and the realities of being black, the poetry lyrically gives a peek at the soft sides of everyday life. I've loved this book since my mother first read it to me, and recommend it to ALL parents, but especially to Black parents and their children."
5,Must have of the Armored Core series!,"Armored Core 3 is a absolutely good buy if your looking for a good Armored Core game. Basically Armored Core three is about how ""The Controller"" dictates every aspect of everyones lives. To combat this hell, most where sent to live under the surface of the earth.

With this Armored Core game you can experience constant fun and a bunch of adventure with a fully designed mechof your choice. It's a great buy and a game you will be playing for a long time!"
3,OK...but you can do more than cope!,I have read the book and I think it just describes the facts of Interracial Dating Precisely. I however doesn't really offer any real solutions. It just helps you deal with the problems and warn you of the challenges...it doesn't actually help you SOLVE the problems involved.It is a good description but not a good prescription. However it does have one thing good about dealing with parents
1,Weak Criticism of Competition,"Though this book presents a few interesting ideas, most of them are confused by far-fetched metaphors and lack of substantial proof. Perelman is clearly interested in making the material accessible, but he does so by using so many different metaphors that it is difficult to figure out exactly what he is trying to say. Though his claims seem to be revolutionary, he touts nothing more than the modern liberal agenda. I happen to agree with his ideas, but the methods he uses to support them are weak and could afford to be better informed by classical theory. If you want a good criticism of modern competition, this is not it. This book ends up being a long justification of an unclear, poorly editted, and weak thesis."
1,This Book is nothing more than anecdotal nonsense!!!,"This book was easy to read and kept me reading for a reason: I was looking for the point!!!Dr. Perelman quotes so many other economists and non-economists without ever bringing anything new to the story. He even goes so far as to provide comparisons to the Biological Sciences, which cloud his point even more.In short, I could not recommend this book any less!!!"
3,"This review is for the Mybat brand cable, not the Boxwave...","Corporation product which I originally ordered. The vendor substituted the BoxWave brand with the Mybat brand.This cable is working well. A mini-CD is included which contains the drivers for the cable. The drivers make the phone appear as a serial device (com5 for example). I am using this on Windows 2000.You will still need additional software to manage the phone content itself--on the 6030 you can only manage audio and video content--no contacts, phone numbers, etc.I understand the Boxwave package comes with drivers *and* trial software."
1,Worst coffeemaker ever,"You would think by now the Mr. Coffee folks would know how to make a coffee maker, but this one was apparently designed by people who have never brewed a cup of coffee in their lives.If the carafe isn't in just the right position, you wake up to a puddle of coffee on yourr counter and floor. Unfortunately, I cannot tell what the right position is--it just overflows randomly.As if that wasn't bad enough, the clock display is right above the carafe. As the coffee brews, the steam infiltrates the clock and fills it full of condensation, making it very difficult to read. After a few months of this, the clock quits working altogether and you cannot set a delayed brew. You read correctly: this coffeemaker kills it's own clock!I will NEVER buy a Mr. Coffee product again."
2,Not impressed,"We've had this coffee maker for about 6-7 months now.1) Where does all the water go?a) It all steams out the back. Therefore, you have to put in more water than what you want to end up with in your finished pot.b) It leaks out the hole in the back of the coffee maker leaving a constant (but small) puddle of water contstantly on the counter. The puddle of water is not large enough to drip over the counter edge, but it is irritating.2) Why does the coffee taste not only bitter but also with plastic overtones?a) Ok, I don't do the vinegar clean every 2 weeks, but I do it at least once a month. That should be enough for only having 1 pot of coffee a day, right?b) The filter basket and lid on the pot are both plastic and I sense that I can taste them in my coffee!Good features:1) The 5 bell alarm letting you know when the coffee is done.2) I like the looks of the coffee maker.3) Not a 3 minute pot of coffee, but brews in a reasonable amount of time."
1,Quit after 11 months,"We purchased this coffee pot to upgrade our old Mr. Coffee coffee maker which is still working after 20 years. Well, needless to say, this machine is now kaput (after 11 months) and we will be returning to our old 20-year-old Made in the USA machine.We noticed that this machine was slowly put out drips of coffee at a time, so we cleaned the machine with a proper de-liming product as directed in the troubleshooting guide. After completing this process, this machine would no longer put out any drips of water. Tried two more times and finally stopped when the machine started spewing water everywhere.FYI, after carefully researching, I will next be upgrading to a Bunn BX-B or Melitta coffee makers as they are made in the USA. For now, it will be a relief to return to my 20-yr.-old Mr. Coffee which is still going strong."
1,Terrible Coffee maker,"I had similar bad experiences with the coffee maker, FTX41,- The coffee is cold after it is first brewed- No longer brews the full pot, only 4 of the 12 cups will brew.- The lid of the carafe always comes off.- Small leak around the base.So I thought that I would voice my displeasure via the Mr. Coffee website. That also wasn't a pleasant experience, apparently "";"" is a special character and the system wouldn't take my comments. So I called in the 800 number. After listening to my issues, the customer service rep was oblivious to my concerns. She said that they would send me a return for the product and after they received the old one she would send me a new coffee maker. When I told her that I didn't want a replacement, she said thank you and hung up. With this kind of quality and service, I will not only buy another Mr. Coffee product, but I won't buy a SunBeam product."
2,Quit after 18 months,"I purchased this model after my old Mr Coffee coffee maker died after _12_years_ of service, and I was satisfied with this coffee maker while it worked. The unit never leaked, but the carafe occasionally did drip on the counter while pouring.After 18 months it just quit brewing (clock/timer still worked) and the hot plate wouldn't heat. The machine was disassembled and I noticed two blown (leaking) capacitors on the control board. Replacing the bad caps didn't help so it must be the heating element/thermostat/thermal fuse that is bad, but I'm not attempting any more repairs.The 18 month life-cycle is simply unacceptable. I'll _never_ buy another Mr Coffee product again."
2,Leaks like a sieve...,"After past experiences with Mr. Coffee products, I told myself I would never purchase another. I should have ""stuck to my guns"". After using this coffeemaker for just over one month, it now leaks from the bottom each time it's used...sitting in a pool of water. Checking out Mr Coffee's FAQ...it seems that my only option is ""send it in for service"". After only one month of use??? BEWARE!!!"
4,I did not used yet.,"I still have packed, eventually I will use. I bought this item because I was looking for a replacement cup. I found the cup by itself."
2,somethings wrong,"I have had this coffeemaker for a lottle over a year. it brewed fine yesterday. today wont even brew a drop. sounds like its working, the plate is heating up, but no water is comming through. and yes there is water in it and plugged in ( the manual says it is either out of water or not plugged in!). out of warrenty, i have no clue what went wrong. I have also had the problem with it leaking all over the counter sometimes like others have stated. I wouldnt buy this again or reccommend it."
2,Loved it... until it stopped working after 6 months,"We loved this coffee maker. Loved it. But after 6 months it just stopped working and when I called Mr. Coffee they just referred me to a repairs center. Made great coffee, but a $50 coffee maker should work for more than 6 months.We just switched to a Bunn!"
1,High Cost - Low Quality,"After about a year and a half, the clock stopped working on the FTX41. Called Mr. Coffee Customer Service and was told; sorry, but it was out of its one year warranty and the clock could not be fixed, there was nothing they could do. Better consider other coffeemaker brands before buying the Mr. Coffee brand."
1,Broke not even a year old,"Worked great until it broke all of a sudden; It turns on, but the pump doesn't work. Tried everything except taking it apart.We've had it less than a year. Very disappointed."
2,Leaky coffee pot,I really liked this coffee pot until this evening. After grating on my poor husband for filling the pot wrong as there was water all over the cabinet and floor he refilled it. Well after cleaning water up the second time we filled it over the sink. The water just poured out the bottom. This morning perfect coffee...this evening want to throw it in the trash. It is only 3 months old.
4,Eight Years of Service,"We purchased this model eight years ago and we've used it everyday since. We usually keep the hot pad on for 4-5 hours to keep the coffee hot and it does a good job of that without the coffee becoming to strong or bitter.After eight years of service the heating element finally died. We felt that that was good so we've re-purchased the same Mr Coffee. The new Mr Coffee came without their ""Permanent Filter Basket"" so we added our old basket to the new machine.Update... September 1, 2012 after 15 months the heating element of our 2nd Mr Coffee died... Bought a new Mr Coffee (same model) that comes with the ""Filter Basket"" at Cosco for under $30 plus sales tax."
1,Stylish but doesn't last long,"I am on my 2nd one in 2 1/2 years and it just died. My parents had the same one, it lasted 6 months. Time to move on to something more reliable."
2,Slow brewing and leaky,"We've had this model for about three months -- we bought it for the programmable function. That works fine, but over these few months everything else went downhill. It now takes forever to brew (as in, more than 20 minutes); if you try to get a cup of coffee early, it stops brewing for a moment but then the coffee streams out. It also leaks water out the bottom all over the counter-top.Cannot recommend this model."
1,horrible coffeepot,I had previously owned a Mr Coffee that lasted for over 12 years. When we remodeled our kitchen two years ago the coffee maker looked shabby. I decided to stick with the Mr Coffee brand because of its reliability. This model stinks. The steam fogs up the clock and I believe it is the reason why the cleaning feature has stopped working. This coffee pot looks worst than the one I owned for 12 years. The metal the has been hit by the steam has corroded. The metal where the coffee pot sits is also corroding away. After only 2 years I am looking to replace this machine. I am torn between sticking with the Mr Coffee brand or looking at another brand.
2,"Planned Obsolescence? Not so fast, Mr. Coffee!","Had this coffee maker for over a year working fine, yesterday it developed a leak causing water poured in the tank to pour out the bottom. Opening the bottom panel, I found two large orange rubber hoses attached to the heating element, and one had simply popped loose. Reattached the hose and the thing is now running leak-free!"
1,Works great for 1 year,"We have now purchased two of these Mr. Coffee makers and both are officially dead. We purchased this based on the reputation of the brand. The first one worked great for 1 year and then quit pumping water. I thought it was a fluke, so I bought another one since we loved the look. It has now been right at 1 1/2 years and this one did the same thing. It will not pump the water. I would not recommend this maker. I hope Mr. Coffee will fix this flaw since we liked the functionality and look."
2,"Pretty, but...","My wife loved the look of this sleek coffee maker. After flooding the counter a few times, her ardor wore thin. The electronics suddenly gave out after one year and a week. After contacting customer service, they sent a replacement. That one lasted about another year when the boiler failed. I had kept the old one in storage and switched boilers. ( OK, I've been down this road before. ) That lasted about two more years. Then the electronics quit.While a pretty design, I can't recommend it. I think the electronics are destined for the rubbish heap. One would think that Mr. Coffee could do better with the boiler, too. After all, it's integral to all of its coffee makers.We have resorted to a less expensive Black & Decker model with the electronics below the pot. They are not exposed to the steam. It's not as pretty, but it has been much more reliable."
1,Beware!!!,"Bought this about a week ago and this product seemed to be working fine. Just yesterday we brewed some coffee for a dinner party. Will taking the carafe out it broke and spilled hot coffee over my wife and kitchen. The top of the carafe came loose from the glass portion, hot coffee spilled all over the place and glass portion dropped on the floor. Luckily the glass didn't break. My wife was so glad our little toddler was not next to him otherwise we would've had a major issue as he usually hovers around my wife while she is cooking.Open further examination of the carafe, it seemed it was not properly joined or manufacturered causing the split from the handle and glass portion.I have used Mr. Coffee products in the past, will never buy again and I am thanking God we didnt have a major injury.DO NOT GET THIS PRODUCT!!!!"
2,Mr Coffee Fails to Deliver,I bought this coffee maker while it was on sale because the features appealed to me. I walked out of the store very happy with my decision. I used the Mr Coffee for about 5 months before the clock (LCD) disappeared!!! Every minute hand placeholder was displayed making it unreadable and unsetable. So much for timed brew.I am currently in the process of contacting Mr Coffee to see if they will do anything about it. I will return with my results.
1,cheap parts,"The thing-a-majig that directs the coffee from the basket to the pot is cheap and broke only after 2 times... and since it was at a cabin and not used much and about 6 months old, we couldn't find the receipt. The brew does not flow straight down from the basket into the pot (that is why you need the thing-a-majig to ""deflect"" the coffee into the pot), so....you need to order another basket which is about $9 plus $6 S&H. Not worth it!! Look at another one!"
2,Six broken pots in one year,"I bought the Mr. Coffee 2 years ago to replace a $10 coffee maker that I'd had for years. It worked pretty well for the price, so I got one for my office last year. That's when I discovered that the carafe is a piece of junk. Maybe the pot that came with the one I bought for my home is better tempered glass, because despite occasional clunks against the sink while I'm half asleep rinsing out the pot, it's held up fine. The one for my office has been replaced SIX times. All it takes is a tap and the glass breaks. Last week, it wasn't even a tap - the coffee was made, we heard a SNAP sound and coffee started leaking out of the cracked pot. The carafes are $10.96 at Walmart, so besides the $40 for the coffeemaker, we've forked out an additional $66 plus tax for replacement pots. We're tossing this piece of junk and buying something with a thermal carafe that's not a Mr. Coffee brand."
1,Simply the Worst.,"In the annuls of coffeemakerdom this may go down as the worst machine ever made. I owned this coffee maker for about 12 hours. That was way too long.I owned a Delonghi that I broke the carafe for and needed a replacement. After much deliberation I decided to give Mr. Coffee a try. Let me just say that I woke up with a puddle of hot water and grounds all over my counter. The mechanism for pausing the brewing is so touchy that if it isn't just right it wll leak everywhere. I decided to give it another chance and made another pot of coffee (while standing there and making sure it didn't make the mess again). The coffee was full of grounds because the filter size is too small to hold the amount of coffee needed for a nice strong, full pot of coffee and the filter leaks into the filter basket.I returned this and bought a Cuisinart 1200. No comparison, spend a little extra now on your coffee maker and you'll save it in paper towels over the life of these two machines."
1,Worked for about 1 week,"Worst coffee maker I have ever purchased. After my machine brews approximately two cups of coffee, it stops brewing and just sporadically puffs steam for two hours. I thought maybe I just got a lemon, but it looks like the reviews are pretty rotten on this one. Will pay closer attention to the reviews next time."
1,Only lasts 13 mnths,"Worked fine for a year. Last week it just stopped brewing. Mr.Coffee said it couldn't be repaired. Yes, I cleaned regularly with vinegar."
4,Loving it so far,"I got the red version of this coffee maker, and so far I am very happy with it. Attractive design, the controls are so easy to use (one of the reasons why I dumped my Kitchenaid coffee maker -- incomprehensibly difficult to operate), and it doesn't drip water all over the place (another reason I dumped the Kitchenaid -- it should have come with a mop). The clock is bright and easy to read. One reason I give it four stars instead of five is that the coffee is not quite hot enough when it is first made, but the nice feature of setting the burner plate to a higher or lower temp compensates for this. I'd rather have coffee just hot enough to drink and not scalding hot and have to wait for it to cool down."
2,I thought this had promise....,"I purchased this as a replacement for a Cuisinart Grind & Brew, fully knowing that I was heading back to pre-ground coffee territory, surprisingly this ended up not being an issue. What was disturbing was the build quality, and to some extent the design.Flatly said, the build quality is poor. The carafe leaks every time your pour a cup of coffee, and the auto stopper consistently gets clogged.The design is such that it has a double flapper for the water and coffee compartments. Water is difficult to pour into the correct compartment, and often gets into the coffee. When the water is heated and pumped into the coffee compartment correctly, it splashes coffee grinds onto the sides and then underneath the coffee filters clogging the stopper.All in all, we are looking at the new Cuisinart Grind and Brew, at least the last Cuisinart lasted four years before we had any problems, the Mr. Coffee began problematic out of the box, and within the first four months began leaking."
2,Worked fine for 1 year,"I bought this machine about 1 year ago. I agree 100% with the other reviews that the carafe doesn't seem to ""fit"" right into the machine - and I have experienced a few overflows due to this issue. Otherwise, the machine worked okay until yesterday. I went to put the carafe into the machine and it wouldn't fit at all, couldn't even wiggle it in. I did some looking and it turns out a piece of plastic in the brewing mechanism was broken. This piece is critical to the brew process - I tried brewing without it and the coffee wouldn't come out and simply brewed into the machine. I tried searching Mr. Coffee's website for a replacement but they don't sell one and neither does Amazon. Guess that means I have to shell out $45 for a new machine, 1 year later.In summary, the machine works fine for a while, but my next purchase will be on a machine that can last more than 12 months."
2,"Worked well for a year, then broke","We were relatively satisfied with this coffee maker for a year and then it inexplicably stopped working. Next time, (which is now) instead of just buying from a retailer, we will research online first."
2,Nice Features - Marginal Coffee,"I don't think there is a perfect coffee maker! I purchased this at Target to replace a Cuisinart that died after several years. I have had none of the problems the other reviewers listed, it worked great. It has some nice features, I like the window for the water, easy to see display, easy controls, temp control for coffee pot, no problems loading coffee or water. I am returning it today, becouse the coffee taste is inferior, compared to the Cuisinart that it replaced, I suspect it caused by cooler water through the grounds, the Cuisinart was hotter out of the brew. There are several features on the Cuisinart that are anoying, display, no water window, etc., however it makes great tasting coffee, to me that's the most important reason for a coffee maker."
2,Mr. Cofee FTX41 Review,"Okay, I absolutely love the design of this coffee maker and that alone has prompted me to purchase it - twice. The bad news, each of the purchases only lasted about a year to a year and a half at best. Very short product life. I am now in need of a replacement coffee maker and I am going to end my three year love affair with this model and try another brand. While this coffee maker looks nice, the parts on the inside are not built to last long at all (especially the heating unit)."
2,disappointed at short life span,I had no issue with the pot for the first two and a half years. It didn't leak or spill. But one day it just stopped working out of the blue. For the amount of money it cost it should work for more than 2 1/2 years. I don't see a point buying another. I need a reliable pot.
1,Bad !!!,"We bought one for the company, after a few months it started to leak, so we bought another one and after a few month the same leaking problem. Never again!"
5,Easy to use - great tasting coffee,"We got it for work and like the chlorine filter atop the coffee basket - and love the timer. Wish it could be set to come on at a time on a certain day, like Wednesdays. Wish we'd gotten one with insulated carafe since we NEED the auto turn off after 2 hours, but it's a long way to the microwave to reheat after that!"
1,P.A. Harris,"I had a Swing-Away can opener for many years and loved it as it was quick and effortless to use. Then had to get a replacement as the blade became dull. The new replacement was a total waste of money as it did not grip the can properly and the can would fall down. Also, the blade did not cut the lid off as the old one did. Very disappointed with the new one and would not recommend this product to anyone."
5,can opener,"I had one of these years ago and left it in the house we sold. I have looked for one ever since and was happy to find it on Amazon. It works flawlessly with no need to fight to get the can started. Great item to have, easy on arthritic hands, and it needs no electricity!!"
5,manual can opener,This manual (non-electric) can opener is the same make and model as the one we had that was 25+ years old and on which the cutter had simply gotten dull from use. So the new one (which arrived in a very timely fashion) actually fit nicely into the wall bracket the old one had been in.We are very happy with it. And it doesn't use electricity!
2,"Worked great, then went to pot.","This worked perfectly when I first installed it. Then the blades would not stay on line with the cans. Have no idea how to correct this, or why it is happening."
5,Rather good,"The product is good, but the only thing I wish it would do is sit flatter on the wall... It sticks out a little bit..."
4,Well made in the USA,Easy to use and saves energy. Solidly constructed. However I really had to search for a place to install it in my kitchen were I could use it without rapping my knuckles.
2,Disappointed,"I had this item previously for 25 years until it finally wore itself out. I searched the web and found the Swing Away Wall Can Opener on Amazon. I was delighted that I could purchase the same product, except, it is nowhere near the quality of the original and wobbles and its cutting is hit and miss. I then discovered by old opener was MADE IN THE USA, and this new one is MADE IN CHINA. Be wary folks, the title of your purchase may be the same, but the production poor.So disappointed in my purchase."
1,Worst Can Opener Ever,"I too grew up in the fifties with one of these on the kitchen wall and have owned one since then, for about ten years in the 90's. Stupidly I got rid of it and just recently decided I'd buy another. Well this one does not work on eight out of ten cans. It just won't grab on and cut, it'll cut an inch or so then let go, or maybe it will grab and cut for most of the way around the can and then refuse to cut the last quarter inch. Maybe mine is a lemon I don't know but I wish I had kept the one I owned in the 90's because this one is a piece of junk. It looks the same and mounts on the wall the same but it does not work well at all."
3,Never arrived,"I ordered the book ""Tiddling Tennis"" and if it ever arrives I'm sure I'll enjoy it. It would appear that Amazon is ""Tiddling""."
3,Andre Matos era live offering,"Angra live are like so many of their melodic rock brethren. A little gunshy in the studio but somewhat heavier and scruffier in a live setting and generally all the better for it. This live EP scoots along nicely helped by a good choice of songs - Crossing drifting into Nothing to Say, then ZITO, a lengthy and very 'muso' Carolina IV and finally Unfinished Allegro seguing into Carry On.Not much to waffle on about - after all it's only a 6 track live EP but Angra fans and especially those who love the earlier Andre Matos fronted version of this band should grab this necely produced release. And I'll leave it to others to argue the merits of Matos vs Edu Falashi.Please note that you may find this packaged with the Freedom Call EP. Get that two-discs-in-one-release if you can as it really adds to the value."
5,Wife Loved It!,Bought this as a Christmas present for my wife and she loved it. It was exactly as described and delivery was very timely. Would definitely buy from this vendor again.
5,I scored so many points with this!,"I bought this for my mother-in-law's birthday. I knew she loved the journey concept, the price was good, so I figured, why not?She was floored!Its a very generously sized pendant, the stones are clear and sparkling, the gold is subtle, and the color combination is very appealing.If you're on the fence, do it. Its a good buy!"
5,10k White Gold White Topaz Journey Pendant,"Very nice pendant, nice quality, when I first saw it you could not tell the the difference if it were a diamond or white topaz, I would purchase it again very nice product."
2,nice but not really nice enough,looks really good online and people gave it really good reviews which is why I bought it for my mother in law for an upcoming birthday. However the chain is really thin and there is a loop on the pendant that doesn't lay flat when you wear it. I am keeping it because I am running out of time but this should be under $100 and not as much as it is.
2,Beautiful but bad quality!,"I bought this for a friend and it looks very beautiful! However after just a months wearing one stone fell out, and within a couple of hours two more stones fell out. For this price I would very much expect better quality. I certainly will not be buying Amazon produced jewelry again..."
2,Jewelry?,"Not what i expected, was a bit small...but again its always hard to judge something like this via the web...i will stick to the store."
4,"Pretty ""Journey""","The 10k White gold March Birthstone Aquamarine Journey Pendant itself is really pretty. My daughter is quite pleased and was very surprised on Christmas. The only complaint I have is that the 18"" chain clasp will not hold. It has come undone somehow twice from her neck and we were just lucky enough to have seen it both times and not lost the pendant. I recommend checking it closely if you purchase this pendant, but I would repeat this purchase with intentions of replacing the chain."
3,Not satisfied,This pendant is not exactly as I imagined. It was a gift and the recipient was happy but am not satisfied. I've only bought jewelry once before (pearl drop earrings) and they were exactly as imagined. I would hesitate to purchase more jewelry on this site.
2,No color,"I'll be brief, looks clear, even with a piece of white paper behind it. Still attractive, but as a birthday gift intended to include birthstones it is disappointing."
2,Gems not good quailty,"I was dispappointed with how light the gemstones were. They are very pale, and some are darker than the others. I would not buy this again."
2,Christmas Gift,I purchased as a Christmas gift for my mother. I am very disappointed in the quality of the product.
4,Nice for the price!,I recently purchased this necklace for my daughter's 13th birthday. It was shipped promptly and packaged well. The color of the stones is nice. I was surprised at the size of them. They were larger than expected and I was afraid they'd be too big on her. I wouldn't recommend it for a child younger than 13. Sized for an adult. She thought it was beautiful!
2,Flimsy,"This is a very pretty necklace. However, I had to return it because one of the top stones was lying next to the pendant in the box, when it arrived. I started to have it repaired, but when I realized how extremely flimsy it was I changed my mind."
4,Beautiful,"The Journey Pendent is of great quality and larger than I've seen for the same price in the mall. I know its going to be a Merry Christmas because I bought this for the woman I love.However, only 4 stars because I agree the Chain is not that impressive."
1,"misleading image, actual product MUCH paler","I'm not very pleased with this item. When I purchased it, I thought it would look like its image on the website. When I received the product, I was startled to discover that the gemstones were so pale that it was difficult to determine if they were even amethyst at all. I do not recommend this item be purchased by anyone, unless you want to have a reason to return items and waste your time."

5,Brilliant!,"This grand drama sees Dirk Bogarde in his last performance, yet one of his best. A film of great dignity, it really makes one think about how precious life really is. A must."
4,"Satisfactory and fits a 17"" PowerBook","Though it doesn't have many of the conveniences of my (recently stolen) Tumi, like externally accessible pockets for cell phone or iPod, slot for your laptop power supply, etc., it is one of the few well-made briefcases that will actually fit a 17"" PB neatly. And, it costs considerably less than the Tumi!"
5,"Best Darn 17"" Computer Bag","I have a 17"" Mac Powerbook and recently got rid of my Targa backpack in favor of a more professional looking computer bag for work. After a strenuous search, I came upon the Brenthaven bag, ordered through Amazon (half-price from Brenthaven's site), and easily stuffed the laptop and all of my accessories in it. The padding around the 17"" is exceptional and perfectly placed pocket for all your cables or airport adapters near the bottom of the bag. The zippers are extremely smooth, the shoulder strap is comfortable, and the bag is highly durable. I expect to enjoy this bag for a very long time...or until they come out with a 19"" laptop."
5,Great Product,I bought my iGo car charger about 2 years ago from a retail store. I love it. I need only one little tip for each of my devices. Every time I get a new cell phone I only have to pay about $10 per tip.I'm so confident in the product that I am about to buy one from Amazon for my mother's birthday.
1,Piece of JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Now I know why they're selling them at a such a low price. They're defective, but I only really found that out during a trip I just took when I couldn't charge my cell phone and Bluetooth headset because the wires inside the charger seem to be broken/crimped. It would start charging and then I'd lose connectivity with the charger. I'd touch it, and it would work again for a few minutes. Over and over.Go buy the ""REAL"" iGO product from a real iGO dealer. These are seconds!"
3,Good but not the one pictured,"this is a good universal charger. the one i received is not the one pictured. I have had one like the one pictured and got good use from it, until i gave it to my son. if this one performs as well, i'll be happy. be sure to get the correct tips that you will need."
1,No manufacturing integrity.,I bought this unit a little over a year ago from Radio Shack and was given a sales pitch that I can use this thing for many instruments just by changing the tips. Great idea for a product except this charger don't last and it's sealed so you cannot replace the fuse. They made this unit so after about a year you have to buy a new one.No manufacturing integrity at all.
1,item bought is NOT item recieved,"when i did a search for this item it came up on amazon. picture and description depicted what i wanted and at a great price. problem is when i recieved it, it was not the item shown, but a knock off or a cheaper substitue... be very wary..."
2,Be Careful,"I bought the iGo charger to be able to charge my cell phone in the car while on trips. What I was not aware of was that this car charger required a tip, which I also would need to purchase to be able to be compatible with my phone. I wish it had been more clear about this and provided a place to maybe purchase this tip. I have search and only found this tip in radio shack. It cost about as much as I paid for the iGo Charger. So Be careful in what you buy and make sure it is what you want."
4,Good Business Phone,"Purchased over two years ago. This is a good basic business phone. The sound quality on the handset is good and you can adjust the volume to make it very loud. You can program several numbers for one touch dialing. The keys are well laid out and easy to follow. The speakerphone worked great for a few months and then became not so great. I can hear on it OK, but when trying to talk and hear it gets choppy and is hard to hear the other person...then I have to pick up the handset to talk and hear. If you have voicemail, this phone does not have a feature to indicate if you have messages. The Aastra 9116 has this feature."
