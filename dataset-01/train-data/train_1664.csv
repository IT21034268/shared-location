4,"""The Mourning of Angels inspires and informs.""","Lydia Schaefer leaves her comfortable, middle-class home in Wisconsin an innocent yearning for adventure in an exotic Latin American milieu. The Peace Corps provides her that opportunity and much more. She learns to survive not only the hostile forces of Peru's physical environment, but also the heartbreak of an ill-fated first romance. More importantly, Lydia learns to question her own complacency about received notions of love, faith, patriotism, and feminism. Lydia encounters,--and is transformed by--customs and practices that throw her psychic world into disarray. ""The Mourning of Angels"" inspires and informs. It will appeal to the reader interested in international politics, feminism, social activism, or the powers of love."
5,An Engaging Story; Excellent Sample of the Initiation Novel,"""The Mourning of Angels"" gives us a dramatic, personally-voiced reconstruction of the events surrounding the historically important pioneering efforts of the Peace Corps. Seen through Lydia Schaefer's eyes, the female journey from protected innocence to worldliness in the Peace Corps takes on a modestly mythic tone. Here, Patricia Taylor Edmisten has given us the boon of needed insight into the female passage from known to unknown during our country's own passage along this trail in foreign policy."
5,The Mourning of Angels,"Patricia Edminsen captures the essence of the 1960s in her book ""The Mourning of Angels.""Her real-life adventures in Peru as a Peace Corps volunteer lets the reader see the poverty and devastation that existed in the backroads of that poor nation at the time.Lydia, the protagonist of the book, brings to life the adventures shared by the volunteers during John F. Kennedy's administration and the contributions made by these selfless people.Not only is the book factual, but it stirs the soul with the realism of sexual encounters in the life of an innocent Catholic girl, away from home for the first time.This is one great novel."
3,OK,Very fashionable shoe but not comfortable at all. Still like but can't wear more than a couple hours...
5,I love this CD. What a voice that Lenore has!,"Sand Dancing is a wonderful representation of a genuinely talented singer/songwriter/keyboardist named Lenore Troia. Famous for her island music and smooth jazz, Lenore shines on this cd recorded in beautiful Key West where Lenore has been a musical institution for nearly 20 years. The songs on this CD will take you to the islands and put you in the mood for a nice Margarita or a cuban cigar!Lenore is accompanied by some close friends and very good musicians to make this a wonderful listening experience.She now resides in the Hudson Valley of New York and can be heard in her new duo called Double Dose with Guitarist/singer/songwriter Mark Wally.Her new CD is expected in 2008! We anticipate this release."
3,Some interesting information here...,"... but it certainly is not definitive. I think John McArthur's ""Twelve Ordinary Men"" is more ""complete"". Opinions vary.It is always interesting to read about historical figures and their lives. This lives up to that expectation and is worth a read."
3,"Not a Pulitzer, but I enjoyed it.","It will not win a Pulitzer, but the story is compelling. I think the author writes from the heart. How else can you express so much disappointment and exasperation? And yet it's a feel good sort of novel ... makes you feel better that all that drama happened to someone else ... until the end, of course."
4,Abuse of Process,Abuse of Process was an exiting book to read. This story is a prime example of how power and greed in the hands of those who can manipulate the law and the court system can defeat the truth. Definitely a fun and easy book to read.
1,"Very badly written ""self published"" book","Obviously the other reviews were written by the author or FOA.Why did author write this as ""fiction"" when he uses his son's real names. And, who is ""Gloria Allrade""? Did he mean ""Gloria Allred"" or was the book not well-edited enough to get the name straight?"
5,This book is written with SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE to enjoy.,"Here is one of the most exciting books I've ever read. It starts out with a one two punch and keeps you wanting to read more and more. It's the type of book that you hate to have come to an end. Bill Band has a marvelous flair for story telling that keeps you glued to the pages. Each chapter is a mini story in itself. He runs you through the complete gauntlet of your emotions. Best of all is his sense of humor. Those were some amazing times and he is one of the amazing people that lived to tell about it, and he tells it SO VERY WELL! The one thing to remeber is that we can put the book down and go do something else. They lived it every day!!!! We can never thank these brave pilots enough."
4,this tape is effective,I bought this tape in replace for another which I couldn't take anymore.This one has good speaking voices where the other was obnoxious as hell!I leave this one on overnight when the birds are quiet.It is recomended that you do this if you want decent results.Get this and let it play throughout.My advice LEAVE THE ROOM! LOL
3,"How To Modify Volkswagen Beetle Chassis, Suspension & Brakes","The How To Modify Volkswagen Beetle Chassis, Suspension & Brakes was above my skill level."
1,Not what I hoped it would be,"This book was a big disapointment!! I was looking for a lifestyle approach to weight control. This a just another enslaving diet complete with a list of things you HAVE to do to succeed, Of course there is a program that is to be started and meetings to attend, you get the point!! Don't waste the money. I found weigh down to be good, if you can get past all the emotional stuff. Plus Reasonably thin by Jesse Dilinger"
1,What a joke!,"This is a lousy excuse for a ""spiritually based"" weight loss program. It is simply a rehash of several other diet programs melded together and re-packaged for sale. The worst part is that it doesn't even help! At least if it were an ""original"" program like it claims to be, it might have something to offer.I am going back to The Weigh Down Workshop. At least I lost some weight with Gwen Shamblin's program... a real original."
1,Who do they make these releases for anyway???,"I am really at a loss as to whom these types of releases are even supposed to be targeted. Anyone who consideres themselves a ""Yes fan"" would not care for these butchered, ""edited"" versions of songs....and as we all know, if you are not a ""Yes fan"" you are likely a ""Yes Loather"" and would have absolutely NO interest in any Yes product regardless of the length of the actual songs.Please....Whomever is behind atrocious releases such as this one....concentrate on marketing a product your proven customer base will actually want!!!It's really sad that the folks working ""in the industry"" have no clue about their artists, product or the desires of their potential customer base."
5,good book,bought for my daughter for schools it came wuick and she was happy thats all that matters got an a in class
4,satisfied,"The viewer is a little slow and could be a little less complicated. I could not get a SDHC card to work in it, but it will take SD and CF cards. If it last me for a year or two, it will be worth the money."
1,exremely dark and sadistic,"did this writer absolutely hate the heroine? Everything bad that could happen to her did and the violence and sexual degredation just became too much barely halfway through the book. if you like that kind of stuff, this is your kind of book but if you are looking for an ""erotic thriller"", which is what the cover of my copy stated, this is NOT it. Only for selected tastes and not for a novice to erotica!!"
2,Regional period piece,"This film is about stock car racing in the 60's in the south. it is the sports story of an old driver helping a young one, they become rivals, then friends and you learn that it is bad luck to eat peanuts in the pits. If you love this era of racing, the film will fill that bill. It is just a good ol story about good ol boys and their noisy toys"
2,An Airman's Odyssey,"For someone interested in how the world's largest airline got it's start, this is a must read. It's filled with details and facts that could only be properly told by someone who was there."
2,First one a dud,"I bought this battery for use with my Minolta 7D. Although there are cheaper batteries to be had on eBay, I was willing to pay more to get warranty and perhaps better quality.Unfortunately the battery I received had a capacity less than 1/3rd of the original Minolta battery even after several recharge cycles. I sent it in to Delkin for replacement, and after a 3 week turnaround (and $5 in postage) I got one that seems to perform similarly to the OEM battery. The replacement also included a plastic cap, which the first one did not have."
4,I Enjoyed it.,I actully Read the Swichers books in third and Fourth Grade. I had no problems understanding it and it was one of the many books I discovered that actully helped me with real life. I was Deeply sad when It was stolen From Me.
2,Not worth it,"The only reason that I finished this book was because I wanted to read Wild Blood (which was just as bad.) It didn't have a very good plot-most of the time there was almost no action. I felt that a lot of the things in the story were irrelevant to the plot, and I thought that the author didn't have a good grasp of her characters. I mean, Tess is a total BRAT to her father, and all he does to punish her is send her to her room? Come on. In real life, she wouldn't have been allowed to go see the phoenix. The only thing I liked about the book was the fact that the author didn't talk down to her audience. Other than that, it was a complete wash-out."
3,Boring,"I found this book to be nothing special. The the plot and storyline weren't very exciting, and to top it all off, the author's vocabulary and wordplay didn't do much of a job in helping to grab the reader's attention. The characters weren't deep, and this particular book failed to hold my attention for long. This is, like said in another review, a good light read, perhaps if you're waiting for your favourite book to come out, or just need something to look at. But I don't suppose this'll stay in your memory for a long time."
5,Ultra-high-1000mAh AAA batteries pack of 4,"Ultra-high-1000mAh AAA batteries pack of 4; these batteries are top of the line for high drain devices, and yes they do last longer than conventional Nickel Cadmium batteries. Make certain that your charger is a Nickel Metal Hydrate (Ni-MH) compatible. Will always recommend Targus batteries"
4,I love it,This laptop is great. I only have a few issues. I wish the hard drive was faster than 4500 rpm and I wish it had the capability of connecting to a docking station or port replicator. I also really like the labelflash functionality. The laptop comes with 1 labelflash DVD that you can use. The problem is you cannot find labelflash media anywhere so it's basically useless.
4,Hardware issues. Thank goodness for warranty!,"I've used this laptop for school and work for about six weeks now and like it so far. The only complaints I have are:The fan vent puts out a LOT of heat. It can make a small area uncomfortably warm.The DVD drive is quite noisy. Fortunately, I don't generally have to use the drive outside my home.Edited to Add: After about 9 months, the motherboard died (with no warning from the hardware monitoring feature of Windows Vista!!). Toshiba customer support/warranty repair department was helpful and handled things in an expedient fashion. Free 2-day mail to the repair center and free 2-day return mail to my residence meant I had a new motherboard within 8 days total (including a weekend) at no cost to me. I just hope I don't have any more trouble! If I hadn't been in warranty, that hardware replacement could have cost hundreds of dollars."
1,Tech Support is a scam,"My daughter's A205's screen (backlight) went out several days ago. She called tech support to have someone troubleshoot the problem. After she explained she had attempted to adjust contrast without success, she asked the technician if she could help her. The technician said ""Yes"". After my daughter paid $35 for help, the technician told her to adjust the contrast (which she had already tried) and when that was not successful, the technician told her she couldn't help her fix the problem.I attempted to get the $35 back. But they have a ""NO SPECIAL CASES"" policy, refusing to even consider it.I will never purchase a Toshiba again. PERIOD.If you ever need help with your Toshiba laptop and it is out of warranty, don't call Toshiba!"
2,"Toshiba puede ser, pero Windows Vista es terrible","Escogí esta máquina con mucha dedicación, que si tenía esto o lo otro, pero lo último que me preocupó es que el sistema operativo del Windows Vista Home Pemium fuera un dolor de cabeza absoluto. El problema no es sólo por la Toshiba, sino por todas las máquinas que tengan este Hardware. No es compatible con ninguno de los equipos que ya tengas y que uses con tu computadora, esto quiere decir que difícilmente podrás usarlos con el Vista, así que agrégale el costo de nuevos equipos ya que no todas las empresas han hecho software de actualización. La opción que te ofrecen es que te compres una licencia del Windows Vista Business porque es el único que tiene una opción para hacer un downgrade al XP. Hasta ahora no sé si mi máquina fue una buena elección porque el Vista me da tanto dolor de cabeza que me impide trabajar normalmente en ella. Ya llevo un mes buscando y actualizando softwares."
2,needs to have the fat boiled off,"Sadly, I only read half the book - couldn't stomach any more than that. Yes, the book has some good stuff in there: a few flesh-and-blood characters, bright moments of tension, a decent plot underneath it all. But my god, this book PLODS, and after 190 pages I coudln't take it. Where's a good editor when you need one?My gripes:1) Way too much irrelevant description - about people's faces, their clothes, cityscapes, trees, apartments - AAAAH, we don't need to know!!!2) Too many irrelevant details about the characters' personal lives. I don't CARE about Smiley's relationship with his wife or girlfriend Ann, let alone to have the same details restated fifty ways.3) Le Carre has an annoying way of taking forever to get to the point. This technique is fine as long as there is tension, but this book lacked it.I tried skimming for a while, but who wants to skim a spy novel? So I quit. FRUSTRATING!"
2,The Karla trilogy,"Smiley's People was a bit beter for me than the others in the Karla trilogy.But the trouble with it, like the others, is 1) its set in the cold war, in a dreary time for England (the malaise of the 1970s) and 2) its is devoid of setting.The books don't have a reference - a way of ""framing"" - the setting. Its Smiley, plodding through the past via convoluted conversations with ex-Circus people that take pages and pages to get through. The fact that it lacks ""action"" is not by itself bad, but combined with the lack of setting it makes for a tedious and in some parts miserable read. It really just does not stimulate the reader - I wonder how many people have been turned off to serving their country by reading these books:)??It needs more ancillary characters, more players; and less retirees.These books do, of course, have a place in literature - but they are not for the average reader. More of a s-l-o-w drama than spy fiction..."
1,I regret every moment spent on this book,"thiS book was given to me as a gift and was highly recommendedi really hated itthere is no surprise no actionvery predictableand the author style is annoying like when he says : "" she's 31, or was she 21?"" how the hell should now? you're the one telling the storyi hoped that in the end there will be some action to compensate the 22 chapters of emptyness but unfortunatly even the end was disappointingi don't recommend this book"
1,Didn't bring a smile to my face,"In his Smiley sequel, this bloke has filled countless pages with the most boring stuff. He cannot hold my attention for more than a few phrases at a time. Mr. LeCarre writes like a pedant and probably is one, fills the cliche of Honorable Schoolboy, that's why he could fill page after page with nonsense maintaining best behavior with a straight face. There is no doubt that he is a Tinker, less Tailor or Soldier, failed lousy as Spy. gerborg"
1,"Promises Much, Delivers Little","""Smiley's People"" was very boring.In a spy novel, something earth-shaking should be happening. There was no coup attempt, no assassination of a world leader, no plutonium, no white slavery, and no impending viral epidemic.What we had was a foolish ex-bureaucrat wasting his own time and money trying to dredge up a decades-old case that was of little importance even when it was current.If anything, the book showed the worthlessness of the intelligence services.The author is skilled with description, and possibly accurate in procedural details, but the plot is weak and the characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting.I put the book down after reading half of it, but I peeked at the conclusion to see if anything worthwhile might have been happening in the second half of the book. I don't think so."
3,"Classic LeCarre, Though Slow At Times","Satisfying to have his rich development of characters. But overall I really felt it dragged at times. Great ending, however. And parts of it were so well written they seemed like models of good novel writing. Grade: B."
4,Very helpful software,"I also have a copy of Palo Alto's Business Plan Pro. I'm working my way through MPP, doing 4 plans at once for 4 different clients. So far, I find it very helpful, and easy to use.I'd like to see a slightly larger array of sample plans to look at, but I can understand the limitations."
4,Christmas card,"It's been a few years since I bought these but they were beautiful, but cost extra postage if I remember right."
5,Essential for all University and College Campuses,"Dr. John Foubert's work in the field of Rape and Sexual Assault prevention has changed countless lives for the better. Not only does his work contain the universal message that we, as a society should work to end all rape, but also it uniquely suggests that the best way to do this is by enabling men as helpers through empathy. The guide is not only helpful to the person reading it, but to the whole community, as it explains how to create a chapter of the organization ""One in Four"", a collection of men seeking to end violence against women. This book, now in it's third edition, has been meticulously researched over a career, refined and revised to include more information, and still is the most effective rape prevention program on a college campus to ever be statistically evaluated. A must read for anyone looking to make a difference and encourage others to do so at their college, university, high school, or sports team."
1,Out of print,"I hated this collection. It is a mash of wildly different themes, mainly uninteresting, pedestrian writing, and the whole concept was deeply exploitive of Beagle's own success. Indeed, the only well-crafted interesting short story in the mix was his ""Professor Gottesman and the Indian Rhinoceros."" There is no unifying type of story, with high brow literary works straining towards horror, some mild sprinkling of science fiction and urban fantasy. Many stories are simply incoherent; others include the mandatory reference to unicorns as an extremely minor chord. Altogether, this work is out of print and deserves to stay there."
5,Excellent information,"Marvelous review. Very good bibliography. It has the best chapter on clinical qEEG, that I've ever read. The only thing that is missing, is a chapter on mood disorders, which I just don't understand. Please make a new edition with updates and new chapters! I can help you guys, if you need me. Enjoy the vast information."
1,This isn't Dennis Miller,"It's some sort of evil, right-wing, Bizarro Dennis Miller from a parallel universe.What happened to the guy who used to think independently? who is this republican shill?Where's the guy who used to talk politics on his show with Tim Robbins? the guy who called George W. Bush 'insipid""? the guy who lambasted McCain for endorsing Bush? the guy who wrote a beautiful piece in his book 'the rants' calling for a return of true liberalism?the guy who used to actually be funny?Never in my life have I seen someone do such a 180 overnight to keep a sagging career alive. And what did it get him? He plays second banana to Sean Hannity.Dennis should be ashamed for dumbing himself down to appeal to the fringe right. Anti-french jokes? Calling for people to beat up antiwar activists?He's become as fake as his bad hairplugsThe Real Dennis Miller R.I.P.1953-2002"
1,Sell-out!,"Dennis tries to save the tattered remians of his comedic career by attacking all things non-Republican.Just remeber, Dennis, it was us folks on the left who gave you a fanbase. The religious right never liked you and never will-that's why your CNBC show is tanking in the ratings.Put a fork in Dennis, cuz he's done"
1,ugh!,"What a waste of my time!Good-bye clever, insightful Dennis!Hello, bitter, washed-up, Republican-hack Dennis!"
1,"bad, plain and simple","it's not that he switched sides politically that ruins this, it's that he dumbed down his humore to appeal to a wider audience. a massive disappointment"
3,Mediocre Miller material,"Even before his veer to the political right, I was a Dennis Miller fan. I watched him all the time on SNL when he was a Reagan hater and saw his live show in college while he was firmly planted left of center. It is refreshing to see an entertainer of any sort that is willing to take up traditionally conservative causes and points of view, and, in Dennis's case, make them funny.Raw Feed, though, is weak by Miller standards. Recorded on the eve -- almost literally -- of the Iraq war, Dennis's takes and predictions, five years later, seem...well...uninformed. Only a handful of jokes got a laugh of me. The rest ranged from cute to painfully ""esoteric"" (as he would put it.)If you're a liberal, and you cannot laugh at the causes you hold most dear, don't watch Raw Feed. You'll just be upset. For the rest of you, especially Miller fans, it's worth a rental but don't buy it. You'll probably not watch it a second time."
1,another former fan here,"Miller isn't funny, not because his politics have change, but because he's dumbed-down his material. Obscure references are gone. (...)What clever insights will he give us next, that airline food is bad or that Oprah is fat? Miller used to be better than this, now he's just reciting stock bits (which, incidentally, are 180 degrees in opposition to the politics of his entire career up until now). If you gre up liking him on SNL, avoid this disk."
1,Ann Coulter with a beard.,"What the F--- happened? He used to be so funny. He used to be so insightful. He used to be inspired by Bill Hicks. Now he simply seems inspired by Bill O-Reilly. Though I'm no fan of the extreme left, if I knew this was going to be such a blizzard of bile drenched ignorance (I think I even noted a bit of froth on his beard), I wouldn't have rented it. I can get that for free by watching Fox News.Perhaps it's the years of looking at the world through the pin-hole of uppercrust right-wing living that has dulled his sensibilities and doomed his opinions to total irrelevence. In any case, if you want laughs, rent one of his old videos. If you want to just stew in the juices of the kind of ignorance that is destroying modern humanity, go ahead and watch this one twice.The thinking world has lost one of its prized jesters; the fanatically extreme right-wing has gained a new monger of thoughtless hate. Congratulations Satan. Job well done."
1,One for the Wayback machine (and not in a good way),"Remember 2003? Seems like a lifetime ago.I think this may be before Shock and Awe. It does appear to be where Dennis took a right turn into crazy land. He's not as much funny as mean. More Rush Limbaugh and less Dana Carvey, Tom Hanks, Jimmy Fallon. He's a perfectly adequate Right Wing Tool. The video is funny only in a sad way."
1,Presentation over functionality.,"Although it was overpriced, we still wanted something that would match a faucet we baught someplace else. As hard as I have tried it will not work. So it fills a hole and doesn't serve the purpose for which it was made."
5,Cool Stories,"Love MZB and her anthologies. If you like this and Sword & Sorceress series you will also like ""Chicks in Chain Mail"" and ""Did You Say Chicks?"""
3,I wanted this puzzle,"This was considered used, but like new...however the page insert was missing. The puzzle was taken apart and placed in a ziploc bag. I wouldnt really consider this to be worth almost $[...] worth!! However, this was a gift for my friend who lost her disney puzzle collection in the hurricane Ike in 2008 flood."
5,Beautiful Watch!,My husband purchased this watch for me on Christmas about five years ago. I loved it then it still feel the same about it now... Beautiful Watch! Great buy!
5,"nail biting,eyeball bulging , egdge of your seat book!","All the stories in this book were either scary, exciting ,reliving, FUNNY. I've now read four of Paul Jennings books, Unbearable was the last one I read. It really kept me wanting to read more. I would stay up late with a flash light under the covers so I could read what was going to happen next. Highly recommended if you want a good book."
5,Must Have!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Marilyn Manson's cover of Personal Jesus is awesome and rocks hard. The remixes of Personal Jesus & mOBCENE are very good and would make this a must have but wait there is more. This Australian import contains the Uncut! , Personal Jesus music video, this single is a must have for this alone. No fan should be without this cd."
5,Much Better than Bose,I tried a pair of Bose 301 speakers for two weeks. I returned them for a pair of these B-3 speakers at the same price point. I couldn't believe the difference. These are far superior to the 301. If you are trying to decide between the two...these totally rock.
1,Klipsch Bookshelf,"Not happy with these speakers. They produce a very muted sound. If you like the highs of horns, cymbals, etc, these are not the speakers for you."
5,awesome,I am using this speaker as the front speakers. Awesome. My friends can not believe the great sound coming from such a small speaker
5,Gatling Gun Parker at Santiago,"This is a large format reprint of Parker's book. While it has all of the text, it does not include the photos, many of which were taken by a member of his detachment.Parker was responsible for the way machineguns are used in modern tactics, and this work is critical for an understanding of military history, including the present. The mention of Lt. John T. Thompson, later creator of the Thompson submachinegun, adds to the understanding of firearms development.Everyone interested in firearms or military history should own this book!"
3,It could be better.,"When it comes to learning languages, it's good to have good books to study with. The information presented in this textbook is great. It gives you cultural information, a decent amount of characters to study, and the vocab lists aren't too shabby either.However! The paper this is printed on makes it awful for writing notes. If you're like me, you like to fill your language textbooks with mnemonic devices and new vocabulary. Unless you're writing in pen, this book is going to keep you from doing this easily.Also, the pictures are horrible. Whoever was hired to do the illustrations needs to learn a thing or two about anatomy. I'm embarrassed to study in public because of the derpy expressions in every picture.One last thing that makes this textbook bad is its lack of explanation on Chinese grammar. Perhaps this only bothers me because I'm used to Genki's great examples and information on how particles and sentence structure work in a language."
3,its ok for those who want to learn basic chinese.,"Each chapter included a little story about 4 friends they use some of the vocab words in the story to give you examples. The list of vocabulary is pretty good. They provide grammar examples but they aren't always that easy to follow. The good thing about this book is that it provides the chinese, english and pin yin version of the stories so its nice to be able to compare back and forth. Overall this is not a bad book its just not a great one. Id wish they show the stroke order of characters in this as well but it does not. I'd recommend buying this book without the character workbook and workbook those two are pretty much unnecessary."
5,The best of the bunch!,"This book is the best one I've seen (and bought) for the beginning Mandarin student. My only complaint is the stress that is placed on written Chinese. For most people, written Chinese is not nearly as important or valuable as building a Chinese vocabulary and learning how to construct a grammatical Chinese sentence. Recognizing the numbers and wind directions is sufficient to enable one to play Mah Jong. I suppose if someone finds themself in rural China, being able to read Chinese would be useful but for everyone else, the time to learn a couple thousand characters would not be well spent."
2,Not easy to follow,I only purchased this book b/c it was the one the instructor required. It's not very good as the flow is not intuitive. Not recommended if you're looking to learn on your own. OK if used as part of a class.
5,thank you,"The first one I ordered didn't come in, but I contacted the owner and were kind to send another book since the other one did not ship in :) Thank you.! perfect condition"
2,Little happy,"I'm not 100% happy with the purchase. The book was suppose to be brand new, but it wasn't."
1,Poor quality junk,"Expected a quality part coming from Parts Express, but boy was I wrong. The gap in the clamp is too small, or is the hole to big, but it won't clamp down on the battery post. The battery is brand new. The block is junk.I threw this away. Not worth returning. Stay away from these. They are useless junk. I may try to widen the slot, but this will ruin the finish, so what's the point. Garbage...If I could have given it zero stars I would have."
3,One size fits none?,"The wire connections are great. My problem with this item, is that the post opening is way bigger than the positive post of my Optima Red Top batteries (yes, I am 100% sure I am working with the positive post). I can fit a flattened 4 gauge wire in the opening with the post, and after the clamp is closed all of the way, it is still not tight. Perhaps it is the batteries than have a smaller than standard post? In any case the seller is great - will do more business in the future!"
1,eh,didnt even use it. its a thick sticker that didnt even fit my 2002 chrystler concord. might work but looks like shit
1,Reads Like a Draft Term Paper,"This slight volume reads like a draft term paper, complete with myriad typos, profuse source quoting, and topic-by-topic organization. The time spent by the author on research and interviewing is obvious and commendable. However, it is infrequently compelling and at times seems like a script for a Discovery Channel episode on the topic."
1,Never sent,"Because there was a price glitch in their schema, my card was charged, then refunded once they figured it out. It's like walking out of a store after purchasing something, then them asking you to come back in and return it because they didn't sell it to me at the right price. In my opinion, NOT GOOD BUSINESS."
1,Skip this one,If you are buying this in hopes of some Bauhaus era Peter Murphy avoid this album. Murphy seems to either have had no artistic input or was very deliberately doing something as far from Bauhaus as possible. This was one of the most disappointing albums I have ever purchased.
4,A Curious Creation,"The premise of combining Mick Karn's virtuoso bass skills with the incomparable voice of Peter Murphy certainly sounds like an intriguing idea, but the results weren't as satisfying as many would have hoped or expected. The tracks are dominated more by Karn's expressive fretless bass work than by Murphy's baritone, which comes off a little thin here. Overall it comes off a bit like Murphy fronting ""Tin Drum"" era Japan (Karn's old band) and Murphy no doubt learned the benefits to be reaped by multi-tracking his vocals as demonstrated later on ""Deep"" and ""Holy Smoke."" The resulting recording is mild bearing more passing resemblance to Japan than to the tensile goth rock of Bauhaus. It's hard to condemn the prowess of Karn and Murhpy, it's just that the results aren't as accessible as you'd hope. Fans of Bauhaus are likely to be disappointed but those of Murphy's subsequent solo work may enjoy this. Approach with an open mind and low expectations and you could be greatly rewarded."
2,Not Comfortable,This chair is not very comfortable even when you use it as a lounge chair. Forget about laying on your stomach. There is a bar that cuts right into your stomach.
1,Levels,I feel only 2 songs on this cd are worth listening to. I just did not like this cd. I am not an expert in smooth jazz style or content.I just know what I like and don't like.Maybe my taste will change as I continue to listen to more smooth Jazz in the future.
3,could have been better,"The delivery was quick and don't get me wrong eibach products are great in my book but you would think a kit that retails for 1300$ would include everything you would need or at least a heads up about things you might need to complete the job this kit does not include the quad shocks or axle dampers, coil spring insulators or new nuts and bolts to mount the shocks for about 60$ they could have included everything! I don't think it would have broken the bank"
5,Excelent,"This is the long waited 'Firewalls and Internet Security : Repelling the Wily Hacker' version for ID. Northcut keeps on the subject without bashing ID or OS systems giving the real basic principles of intrusion detection, very good."
4,Overall a good book,"This is a great book. It provides good detail on crucial ID topics. The examples in the book are clear and easy to follow. The book also does a good job of describing IP fragmentation. I would also recommend that someone get Bejtlich's The Tao of Network Security Monitoring. Read Network Intrusion Detection first then read The Tao. You will be an expert in the area of intrusion detection and network security monitoring.The only down side to this book is that not enough attention is paid to exploring the gory details of networking like Ethernet frames, IP/TCP/UDP/etc. packets. This is an important topic for security people to understand."
5,Buy this book now!,"This book is one of the better technical books I've read. It is easy to understand and goes into depth explaining the theory on which intrusion signatures are created. If you know basic TCP/IP but really want to know its inner-workings, get this book. I bought it less than 24 hrs ago and I'm already 100 pgs through it. This book takes a subject that could potentially be very dry and breathes a gust of fresh air into it. Recommended!"
4,Understanding packets in the wild,"Steven Northcutt has put together a truly fascinating and helpful look at Network Security and Intrusion Detection. The book is littered with dozens of packet sequence examples and excellent narative which helps explain an often time difficult topic. I found the initial section on TCP/IP a welcome refresher, however those of you who have already read ""TCP/IP Illustrated"" will want to skip that portion entirely. After reading this book I really don't think you'll ever look at log files in the same light again."
5,"Network Intrusion Detection, 2E","Serious Intrusion Detection (ID) analysts need this book. It is the best book I have read so far which really addresses the difficulties associated with ID showing a wide range of examples. In my opinion, it could easily be used as a training manual for new and upcoming ID analysts teaching them the art of Intrusion Detection.A great companion!"
4,Brainerd Mfg Co/ Liberty Hdw 5' oak spoon Pull,They were the same style but not the same metal. All worked out well though. I just put them where they weren't right next to the old ones.
4,Solid first solo album,"In his first solo effort (if you don't count Dalis Car), Peter walked away with a slightly disconnected, but powerful freshman effort. What I mean by disconnected is that the overall flow of the songs does not work together as well as later albums. Maybe part of it was his newly found freedom, the other thing could be the nature of his writing/performing relationship with Howard Hughes. Peter went on to find much more success on this front when working with Paul Statham.Don't get me wrong -- there are some masterful songs on this album, including 'Canvas Beauty', a cover of Pere Ubu's 'Final Solution', and my personal fave, the majestic 'God Sends'. Also of note is the wonderful b-side, 'Tale of the Tongue' which is well worth tracking down. But the album is just a warm up to his two best albums, 'Love Hysteria' (my favorite) and the crowd-pleaser 'Deep', where the connections between singer, songwriter, and musical-deity tend to blur."
3,"First solo foray stumbles, finds footing","Peter Murphy's first proper solo CD showcased his infatuation with late 70s/80s-eraBowie and the UKs early 80s New Romantic pop movement. One minute he stretches himself with ""interesting"" 80s white boy funk (a la Japan) and the next he somewhat redeems himself by giving his Bauhaus followers something to bite on (namely the fine cover of Pere Ubu's ""Final Solution""). Hardcore fans should check it out."
4,Icon's Solid Solo Debut,"This album feels like a post-Bauhaus album with the singer searching to establish his own identity. Much like Love & Rockets, Peter too had to search to find out who he really was after the breakup. On this album, he doesn't know yet. He is still trying to create more of a piece of art, music-on-a-canvas, rather than an album. There are some great moments, and ""Final Solution"" is one of the better singles from that year.Still I feel that Peter's better solo work came later (especially on his next 2 releases), and his better artistic vision came earlier with stronger bandmates."
4,perfect,Bought these together with the corresponding full-length drawer slides to replace contstantly breaking European style drawer slides with plastic fittings. These work very well and are relatively easy to adjust. It is probabably easier to intall them when cabinets are being constructed than retrofitting but both ways work.
1,Only last about a year,We bought the power cord on Jan 2008 and six months later the part of the code that attached to the plug adapter started to come loose. Then after a lot of electrical tape and care of not bending it the cord at that position for six months it completely broke. I would recommend buying a higher quality power cord.
3,cheap and worth every penny,"I ""upgraded"" to the ptid4007 from the 4002 model. Disappointed with what the newer one didnt offer. No auxillary input on dash. No way to view clock without going to radio or turning unit off. No firmware support. Manual seems to be written by someone not familiar with English. The good stuff: good price, easy to install, i-pod input(cable needed), very good sound( great with amp and sub) and looks good. Overall, a pretty good value. Would recommend for a budget-minded shopper."
2,Loses voltage quickly,"Bought this to have a spare battery for my V550 on vacation and it does not work as well as the OEM battery. Specifically, when trying to take multiple photos a few seconds apart, the battery quickly drains and needs to rest between shots. The low battery warning comes on, and if you keep using the camera, it will shut down due to insufficient battery power. Let it rest for a few minutes and you're ready to take pictures again. The total number of pictures I could take with this battery was similar to the OEM, but the lag and the frustration of the camera shutting off was not worth the savings (~$5) when I bought this battery."
3,"""Yo dadah is HIIIGHLY clairvoyant!!!""","Some very good scenes in this movie; Cain has long been a childhood nightmare of mine. Overall though, this movie is just another cheap attempt by Hollywood to milk a good idea for all it's worth. Very cheesy plot line involving Indian Heritage and customs yield a weak climax.The absence of the older daughter, Dana, is very obvious and equally as cheap as the pseudo-Native-American theme. I know Dominique Dunn died shortly after the first film, but get another actress or at least mention that she's at college or SOMETHING. Geesh!P.S. Follow my pal Lenny Maltin's advice about the vomit creature. You'll thank yourself later."
3,"Not as scary as the first, but suspensful","This continues where the first left of at. The family from the first movie move to Arizona only to figure out the demons followed them, and they meet the leader of the demons himself Cain."
2,A disappointment,"Considering the bullseye hit by the creative team on the first film, this suffers a profound loss from the departure of Steven Speilberg. The acting in this movie really deserves to be panned becuase the talented cast is pretty awful. While it has it's moments, the movie fails to be as scary as the first and instead goes for what the first didn't...sloppy creatures that provide a chuckle instead of a gasp. Julian Beck is good and Zelda Rubinstein tries to hard to sell her acting but it doesn't hold up. The ending is particularly bad."
1,Not in the same leage as the first Poltergeist movie!,"Poltergeist was great but Poltergeist 2: The Otherside was horrible, it was too creepy, too gross and too stupid! The first Poltergeist was scary but it was better then this movie!"
1,"the horror, the horror","I recently saw Poltergeist and was reminded why it remains (pun intended) one of the most frightening films I have seen. I then unfortunately wasted an hour and a half of my time watching this insepid sequel which truly goes from bad to worse. The lighting is terrible (I think that it was filmed in a real house, not a set) and the effects are laughable, as is the acting. The old man is supposed to be creepy, which he is, but he is as about as frightening as an old sock.The film really dies when the family ""bands together with love"" to battle ""the beast."" The movie takes a Scooby Doo meets Tom Sawyer turn as the haunted/hunted family battle the forces of evil in a nasty wet series of caves.A Native American and a midget (dwarf? little person?) help the haunted family battle Satan. Wait! Wasn't that the premise for a recent South Park episode? ; )"
3,just when u thought it was getting good....,"the movie was over...and not only was it over...but it had the stupidest ending I have ever ever seen....the other side? Please, what the hell was that? The ending of this film was soo soo weak... it could have been so much better...i mean..the film itself was slow and really boring with an occasional good two seconds thrown here and there...and as it was getting good...it got stupid when the family traveled to the other side...where was all the goop that came with carol ann and her mom when they came back from the other side in the original...it was all just white clouds...what a doppy, stupid, ending to a movie that could have worked....unfortunately it didn't....."
1,"Scooby Doo, meet Tom Sawyer. Tom, this is Scooby.","I recently saw Poltergeist and was reminded why it remains (pun intended) one of the most frightening films I have seen.

Wait! Wasn't that the premise for a recent South Park episode? ; )"
3,Worth It!,"""Poltergiest 2: The Other Side"" is a repeat of the supernatural. Taking the Freeling family back to their old neighborhood of Cresta Verde where their daughter Carol Anne (Late Actress Heather O'Rourke) was abducted by unrested spirits that were stuck between the spiritual and physical world.In this sequel, Carol Anne is abducted once again by unrested and angry spirits, and her parents (Actors JoBeth Williams and Craig T. Nelson) were told by a native American Indian they must return to Cresta Verde to confront the spirits on their own ground or they will never stop searching for Carol Anne. Can the Freelings protect their daughter from the paranormal? Or Will Carol Anne once again become part of the living dead?"
3,Poltergeist Again,"I think it was a pretty good movie for it's time. It is not the classic that the first movie was, but a close second (pun intended). I would have rated it higher if there were special features. No additional features is a waste of blu-ray space. The could've put the E True Hollywood Story featurette on here if they had nothing else."
5,Love this movie but wrong region,Before buying this movie I had no idea about regions... I tried watching this movie and found out that it is not compatible with my dvd player or any type of gaming system that plays dvds.... However amazon was awesome and refunded my money without requiring me to return the movie due to my ignorance regarding the regions...
4,i really liked it.,"I LIKED THIS MOVIE. I WOULDN'T SAY THAT IT COMPARES TO THE FIRST, BUT IT WAS STILL PRETTY GOOD. I JUST WISH IT WOULD COME OUT ON DVD, NOT JUST BLU RAY, IN REGION 1."
3,Poltergiest 2 is not that bad of a sequel!,"This movie had the same ""good"" scare from the first one! If you liked the first one you will like this one too! Dont miss out!"
3,I HAVE TO REVIEW THIS ONE AGAIN,"I love this movie, yet the first time I reviewed it, I noticed I didnt give it the credit it deserved. Sequels are usually shunned anyway no matter how good they are. This one looks like some good dialog might have been cut to make the film shorter...that is why the action is too complex. True, it doesnt give us the 100% feel of the original, but it tries to. Once we see the family again you almost get it back. This time however they put you face to face with the DARK MAN {no pun from THE STAND intended} Julian Beck is fantastic and scary...The ghosts dont waste time, poking at the family....they go right after them. The preacher goes right to their house... This one is good....go rent it and bring the POLTERGEIST movies into the new millenium."
4,a good sequel,Poltergeist II does a good job following the plot of the first movie. The only thing I didn't like about this film was that it was a little too short compared to the first one.
2,SCARY!,This movie is so scary! Henry Kane is a nightmare. When I first saw this movie when I was 7 years old I had nightmares about henry kane every night the scariest person I have ever seen! That scary person is all this movie has going for it. Picture this movie without Kane? Pretty bad right! The first film was so much more better it was light and not as scary and carried more of a intresting story than this film. This is just too creepy and lame both sequels were bad they should have just left that first movie alone.
2,"THEEERE BAAACK........NO, NOT SPIELBERG OR HOPPER","Poltergiest 2 is scary. Watch the movie for what it is, and dont look for state of the art special effects, even though they have lots. The first ten minutes of the movie is slow and boring. But when the Poltergiests arrive...get ready. There is pleanty of action after that. The only problem I have is, why do they keep going back into the house."
3,Disapointing,"In my project, I wished to success the debate Are Horror films better than their sequels? This clearly is an example whereby the film gets worse and worse. But still it wasn't actually all that bad. The plot continues where it left off. CarolAnn Freeling moves with her family to their grandmother's house. The poltiergeist are not far away though, and follow her only to create outrage and mayhem once again. Some of the scenes are shocking, the worm incident, the dark man, but they were a little too brutal to show as Poltiergeist, it's predecessor had a violent yet fairytale like feel to it. A dismal sequel, yet overall quite watchable and at times enjoyable."
2,So so,"After the phenomenal success of Poltergeist, it would have been impossible to better it. After an horrific ordeal, the Freelings move from their original location to a relative's house (grandmother) For a while, things seem to run fine. However, it isn't long before the poltergeists come back to haunt Carol Ann.Poltergeist 2 takes a different view than it's original. Rather, it delves in deeper to the question of the supernatural. A symbol of ghostly evil in the shape of Kane (very creepy guy) comes to pursue Carol Ann and disrupt her family. Can Carol Ann defeat him before he claims the lives and souls of her and her families?Overall, a boring film which could have been better. Don't get me wrong, the plot is still quite good but it lacked one necessary ingredient- thrills and action.Watch it if there's nothing else on."
4,don's review,"I HAVE SEEN THE FIRST 2 PARTS BUT THE 1ST FILM HAD ALOT MORE HORROR SEQUENCES IN IT, THE 2ND WASN'T AS SCARY BUT STILL GOOD I THOUGHT, I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE 3RD PART OF THE FILM I HOPE IT'S AS GOOD OR BETTER THAN FIRST"
3,Poltergeist II-Decent but still flawed and certainly not like part 1.,"All the Main Protagonists are back,before the fiasco of Part 3,this movie sandwiched between them is at least decent but sadly lost potential,I love the Native American added to the equation,I Like the creepy Old Guy character but I found it a little too easy for the so-called ""Reverend"" to have been As Most Un-Holywood Portrayals of religion to be in bad taste(Despite being a Catholic myself and knowing that such Protestant Sects sadly exist.)Other than that,It just doesn't hold my attention as much,I remember being creeped out and sickened by the liquor-worm,It still isn't Part 1(The Original.)"
4,Great trigger,This trigger is great took me about 5-15 minutes to install mainly because i have a tippmann 98 custom platinum series and basicly ever time u get an upgrade its not for the platinum so i just had to take a lil screw driver to make one of the holes fit a lil more loosely since it wasnt as loose as the trigger i had on before. so great buy everything is perfect if ur questioning this buy you shouldnt one of the best deals. 4 stars because the shipping took longer than usual
3,Great price - questionable build,"It seems this isn't the official ""GTA"" Tippmann Double trigger and I experienced the same problem that most others on Amazon have complained about: the spring that resets the trigger and 'triggers' the sear seems to be of poor build.I say this because after several attempts to oil the spring, reset its position, replace in two Tippmanns - it doesn't seem to want to work. I'm still trying to figure out what the solution to this problem (I'm all ears if anyone has any suggestions) may be and hope after more tinkering I'll get it to work.Why three stars?Well, I didn't feel it earned five for obvious reasons, nor did it earn one because having owned a double trigger before I do know how convenient they can be. I'm not scathing the entire product because I do urge fellow Tippmann'ers (?) to purchase one as one of their first upgrades. I just fear that I may have gotten a poor sampling from Amazon."
4,GooD,This double trigger works great the reason i give it 4 stars instead of 5 is the guard requires a little bendingCheers!
1,Triggers are not Tippmann's forte,"Regretfully this double trigger was not a good purchase. Its plastic, and it does not create the trigger speed I expected. My A-5 gun rocks, even without this trigger, I was looking for a little extra kick in speed, but this trigger is not whats going to give me that."
2,BE AWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Please be aware that this trigger does not fit the Tipopmann 98 custom pro. Other than that it looked pretty cool.
3,trigger,this trigger looks nice but doesn't work well with my response and it kept sticking and messing up with the saftey. shipping took forever but its nice if u have a single shot.
3,"Good intentions, nearly useless though","There is nothing wrong with the trigger, it functions well and mine is personally about 7 years old. Obviously very durable. But I have to question Tippmann's intentions when they designed this trigger. It is VERY hard to walk, especially if you are still using it mechanically (like I am). However the best use I get out of it is when I take off the trigger guard and slam my finger, bouncing it off the hose and trigger, I can get up to 5-6 balls per second that way."
1,s*** protect,it did not work at all and i was unable to git it to work after about three days of working one it the thing broke in play...
2,Double trigger,"This trigger will not function properly with my 98 custom ACT. not sure why. im going to try mod it up a bit and see what happens. After you pull the trigger with the tank on, the trigger will not reset and catch the sear. without the tank on my gun and hand cocking it, it works every time."
4,Great,"Nothing wrong with this at all. I got it quick and it was very easy to install in my 98 custom. Nothing bad to say but i rated 4 stars just because i think its a little expensive for what is basically two chunks of plastic and a spring, but You gotta make money. I would get this as it is pretty durable and increses your fire rate to whatever you can do (Get a cyclone feeder for even more potential)"
1,this is a peice!@#$?!!,if you get this youll only want to use the trigger guard then end up ordering a metal double trigger like techT's fang...This is NOT WORTH BUYING.
3,"Too Much Walden Pond, Too Little Mavericks","Overall, this is a worthwhile read for surfing enthusiasts, but it is around a third too long. Active surfers and fans of surfing will likely find the ""naturalist passages"" insufferable after a time. Had Duane included one more description of a field of vegetation, I would have set the book on fire. When Duane is talking surfing, the book is an engaging read. When Duane is pretending he is Thoreau, the book is a big yawn. At one point Duane describes the appeal of Bruce Brown's The Endless Summer. He notes that the film shuns ""mystical overtones of truth-seeking"" and instead embodies a ""fifties hedonism of wholesome, laid-back fun."" Too often, Duane does just the opposite. For me, the appeal of surfing is the speed, the grace, the athleticism, the danger. What has no appeal for me is a wanker sitting on his board looking at grass for two hours."
4,The Philosophy of Surfing,"To sit in freezing water with even colder air temperatures for hours waiting for a good wave is an exercise in discipline, although a lot of people would say that discipline is precisely what the quintessential surfer lacks. Author Dan Duane exhibits discipline and several other honorable traits in ""Caught Inside,"" his thoughtful memoir of a year spent following a dream and accomplishing a goal. While some may scoff at what can be called the ""surfer mentality,"" Duane goes deep beneath the surface and dredges up a lot of emotion and introspective philosophical sentiments about why he surfs (and why he does anything worth doing). Duane is well-read, intelligent and expressive, and the book is interesting, beautifully written and thought provoking. I would imagine that Duane's musings would be valuable, meaningful and applicable even to those who have never even seen the ocean, much less ridden a wave.PS to reviewer Christopher Seal - women surf too!"
2,"to a non-surfer, its a great book depicting surferlifestyle","having surfed for twenty years Ive found that the book was quite boring , to a surfer, and ive read all of them, north shore chronicles,life over the edge,perfect storm,etc, and had a few brushes myself, it seemed while reading the book I was waiting for some big, big wave finally but in the end it just fizzeled I should have known with a name like Daniel Duane well sheeit sounds like he be bon don sout, li dat in some louisiana mosh in da mud."
4,ocean minded,"I picked up this book as part of a plan to visit the coast of California. I got what I wanted, but I also got something more. There is a capture here of the soul of the person who has committed to the sea and coast. Living in another part of the world and being more into kite and windsurf than surfing, I still recognised the mind frame described in this tale. It does not even have to be related to water sports at all. This is a tale of choosing a different life, if only for a period of your life. I find it impressing to write a tale about such a subject without resorting to shanty clinches and judgemental statements about people on the other side, living ""normal"" lives. Sometimes great books are hard to find because they talk about small subjects."
2,"Overwrought, rambling","I started reading this and at first it seemed like the author could write. But then he piled on cliche after cliche, and seemed to have a compulsion to over-describe everything, trying too hard to be picturesque or literary. This made the whole thing seem forced. It also made the book ramble. It seems that so many writers about surfing have to drag in all kinds of literature, history, mythology, psychology, philosophy and religion to make the topic relevant or appealing. This isn't really necessary and it seems awfully artificial. Just another attempt to cash in on the surfing craze? I wouldn't recommend this book."
2,"Should be retitled ""A Year in Santa Cruz"", not the Coast",Author's retelling of historical events is interesting and well-done. The retelling of his first-hand experiences are sometimes confusing and always verbose.Cannot say I would recommend this book. Not sure if there is a point or purpose to this book or his stories.Also the entire book takes place in Santa Cruz area. I imagined with the title the stories would involve the actual California coast.
3,A surfer's review,"I was assigned reading this book in Maritime History course I took during college. Having been a surfer for the better part of 12 years this book was tolerable, but smacks of an elitist attitude. Taking a year 'off' in your life to pursue surfing must be a nice experience the majority of us shall never know. Latte-drinking, poetic prose writing aside it does capture some of the emotional and aesthetic beauty innate to the surfing experience. I tended to find this book irritating, the view of someone attempting to infiltrate the core of true surfers and their way of life. At many points he would not be welcome in the line-up where I'm from.If you know absolutely nothing about surfing, you will most likely find this book interesting. The lack of a compelling story other than a description of surfers and the West coast prove to be detractors. If you are an avid ardent surfer you may enjoy it, simply because it's about surfing. While it's still on my bookshelf, I haven't read it since."
2,nah,"The comment 'when you don't have anything nice to say....' comes to mind regarding doing a review of this book so I'll try to keep it brief. I think I disliked the book overall because I just didn't like the author. Subtle put downs, I surf therefore I am kind of thinking.Just irritated me. The writing is carefully crafted and the guy is obviously a thinker, but you can be a thinker and a prat and then the joy is lost for everyone.Didn't like it."
1,"a waste of time, read Perfect Storm instead","I kept waiting for it to get good, but it just fizzled like a wet firecracker, you expect it to end with something special but..."
1,"Is a ""no star"" rating possible?","I dare you to read the preface and not want to vomit. My reactions are: ""this guy gets published?"" and ""did he ever take a basic writing course?"" Some examples of his skills: ""...wonderfully human gourmet ghetto..."" ""...presumed unintimate..."" ""...painfully successful..."" Save yourselves my friends. This book is not worth lifting, let alone trying to read. I envy Mr. Duane for getting money to ""write"" this drivel. I wish I were so lucky."
2,"kinda dull, sophomoric, self absorbed","I grew up on the ocean, I know all too well of its power and allure, I am also a surfer.He seems too concerned about what a surfer should be and wear. Ex: hooded sweatshirts. And why the slap at mountain bikers? Are they really geeks? c'mon, grow up, Mr. Good Karma shortboarder! Go after jet skiers instead. They are the enemyI will say the history was damn good, he should focus his work on that, he shows a true knack for that.However his is description of the California coast reads like a Berkeley freshman's essay. My advice to those who gave this book 5 stars: lay off the bong hits and surf some more."
3,Wipeout!,"Being a non-surfer, I found it interesting to get an outsider's look at the surf world. Duane does what a lot of us wish we could do--pack it all in and do something we'd like for a year.The problem with this book was it didn't really jump out and make surfing seems the wild, exciting ride it is ""sold"" as. Maybe it isn't, but at least I'd like to think it is."
4,A Year of Discovery,"A Berkeley intellectual leaves his girlfriend and retail job behind to become a part of the Santa Cruz, California surf community. In this autobiographical account, Duane immerses himself in the environment and history of the area, while developing a deep appreciation for the peculiar nuances of his chosen pursuit and its practicioners. The thoughtful description of the blend of freedom, exhilaration and commitment which characterizes the surfing lifestyle make ""Caught Inside..."" a terrific read for anyone who has ever wondered why ""work"" retains higher priority than ""play"" in our day-to-day lives"
2,two stars for vocabulary,"Duane seems preoccupied with the idea of ""surfer."" How one dresses, speaks, acts. It seemes he woke up one day and decided to become one. Got a dark hooded sweatshirt (pulled it low over his eyes), a pair of flip flops, a custom board and viola! While there is a code of conduct in the water, there is no ""surfer."" They're just a group of people driven by and obsessed with a common goal: the perfect wave. Most of them have left behind the notion of acting like the guy next to them by the time they are eighteen."
2,boring,"I was eager to read tis book when I got it as a gift, but found it to be hard to read more than a few pages at a time. The author uses so many references to other works that I felt I should have read them instead. Also he seems to get lost in very wordy discription of quite trivial things that have little to do with the story, which by the way was very weak at best."
4,Stoked!,Daniel Duane captures more than just the sport of surfing; the lifestyle and passion of everyday surfers is elegantly revealed by Caught Inside. If you are looking for tales of big wave heroics look elsewhere. If you can relate to Henry Beston (The Outermost House) meets Bruce Brown (The Endless Summer) this book will leave you stoked.
2,sophomoric,"While entertaining, I found it read like a Creative Writing 101 project. He goes on and on (and on and on and on) describing the natural beauty, after a while I'd say ""enough! How about the surfing?"" The ""poetic"" parts were repetetive and frankly not all that inspiring.Don't get me wrong, being a surfer myself, I found it lovingly researched, and very interesting at parts, especially the history. Sadly, most of it reads like an article in ""Surfer"" or ""Outside"" magazine."
3,Commited to Surfing,"As a land-locked non-surfer, I read this book to get an idea of what surfing is like. I can't vouch for its accuracy but it did seem to capture something about the reality of surfing, that is, surfing in all conditions, learning by doing and from willing masters, always checking ocean conditions and being ready to drop everything and everybody when waves roll in.Sometimes a paragraph or two seemed to get ethereal (or aquarial?) to the point of being unintelligible but that was a small glitch in an otherwise informative book about the quest for good waves unspoiled by wind or bad weather, surfboard shaping and engineering, careers and lifestyles built around tide charts, sharks, coastal flora and fauna and the pecking order of surfers at a local break. A good read that breaks through the romance of surfing to expose the work of committing to this strenuous sport."
2,Over Rated,"This book is ok - not excellent - if you give it 5 stars you really need to read some more books. It is somewhat interesting in describing the life of a surfer but its extremely repetitive, it drags on and its lacking in any action and that certain something that seperates the wheat from the chafe.You can almost feel the editor saying we need to spice this up - what about sharks - so there are forays into sharks and surfers. It gets ridiculous when he writes about being scared to pee in the water because a great white will smell it and come in and chomp you. Yes - that is really a huge concern I think 100 surfers were eaten by great whites last after they peed in the ocean.If you are going to read this book - read the first few chapters and then put it down because the book, you won't miss anything later on - except for silly shark myths."
1,Junk,"This part is junk. Oversize mount hole won't clamp on post. Threw in garbage. Not worth returning.I purchased both the + and - clamps and neither would tighten properly. This is onto a brand new battery. I picked up a couple of cheap lead clamps and they work perfectly. If the slots were cut deeper or the holes were reamed smaller these would work, but these must have been overlooked by QC and got sold as-is.These might look pretty but they simply do not clamp onto the battery posts properly rendering them useless junk.Beware of this issue before you consider purchasing these clamps."
5,A Great Read with Great Advice!,"People don't easily part with copious amounts of their discretionary energy to do great work that customers will gladly pay for. But under the right circumstances, they can, and will. The only question is, are those people working for you, or a competitor?Guaspari is a genius at getting the point across, and leaves you with practical advice that works!Bill Catletteco-author, Contented Cows"
4,a good beginning,"If you never heard the fall before, this is a good accesible place to start, yet it is one of the least played of my 32(! )Fall cd's. A better commercial disc is This Nation's saving Grace, but if you want to get to the root of teh band, try Dragnet. Still, they remain the greatest band in the world, and count yourself lucky you got here!"
4,An oldie but a goodie,"I read a the other reviews and pondered my own position for about 3 seconds. This is how much time it took me to decide to write my own review. The recent movie was a blast and technically fabulous.The colour episodes were brilliant but the black and white can only be described a ""must see"". I for one found it refreshing not to be knocked on the head with plot. If effects and whiz-bangery are your thing then don't bother here. These actors had to rely on talent.The bugs on the data-capture were a bother but hey this is a trip into the past! I found the style and substance made up for the short comings in the fliming!!!"
2,For completists only!,"The picture quality is very dark and the sound is bad. This bears such little resemblance to the series that was to follow in almost every way. But even judging it by its own merits the primitive production values let down the material. Honor Blackman is very good as Steed's partner. A filmed series with Macnee and Blackman really would have been something, but this is unfortunately for completists only."
3,good condition,they came in and 2 out of the 3 tapes worked .... the 2nd tape only worked for about 10 mins and then we could not get it to no matter what we did . the other 2 were in good working order.
2,AND YOU THOUGHT THE MOVIE WAS BAD!,"if you think this is anything like the emma peel avengers then think again, as the reviewer says rarely seen in usa,thats because nobody wants to see them.true,the plots are there but mostly talk with little action.the picture quality is really dark on the dvd.it gave me a headache.the british talk is pretty heavy also.i know it was made for brittish tv,but sometimes its hard to understand the slang - cheario old chap.one of the biggest problems was these are shot on video instead of film. like some of the twilight zone episodes,more of a staged play.honor blackman is more of a stiff,tough looking,no nonsense person who wears a lot of leather.she reminds me of lauren bacall.dont get me wrong she is a good looking woman.but she was a fling for james bond and diana rigg was the woman james bond married.well i bought the dvd with high expectations and to tell you the truth it put me to sleep."
1,5 stars?? Come on!,This relatively small book is mainly filled with tasteless drawings and pictures that really don't inform you of anything useful. The usable content is minimal and at a level that may be a beginner would appreciate. It is terribly overrated.
2,You grow girl,This book wasn't what I thought it would be...I don't dislike it but I didn't get anything out of it....Thank you for mailing right away
4,Hip General Gardening Book,"I had ""You Grow Girl"" checked out from the library for almost a year. It was time to return it and purchase the book for myself. There are lots of easy to follow suggestions and great looking craft ideas in this book. Just wish I had more time to do them. If you live in an apartment, condo, or other urban space this is a great resource. It is a hip, fun book to read. However, it will not answer all your questions. That is okay, you can always find answers to more detailed questions on the internet."
5,Awesome,This is a great book for the wife. We wanted to start growing fresh vegetables and this shows us how. Very good book.
4,Great for a beginner - experienced gardeners may not enjoy,"If you are a beginner like me, this book is amazing. It's taught me a lot. If you've been gardening for years it might not have so much to teach you. The artwork is pretty amazing and definitely charming. I like the section on gardening for your cat, the apron pattern and other DIY tutorials. It may seem geared towards younger women but honestly, I think any gender of any age could enjoy this book very much. It is focused on urban gardening, but I live in a rural area and it is still useful to me. If you're new to gardening *and* want to start an urban garden - you really must get this book because it'd be perfect for you !"
1,Misleading amazon title,"I needed the instructor's manual to the most recent edition of this book, but received instead the student's version and a much older edition, dating to the 1960s. Needless to say I'm not to happy about it"
1,Do NOT buy this album,"I have never written a review for amazon.com, and I doubt I will again. However, since I bought the album here, I feel obliged to share my thoughts.Here they are - his songs are really bad, he cannot solo to save his life, and I wish amazon.com had an open exchange policy like Tower Records."
5,One of the very best! And very listenable to boot.,"I decided to check Stump out after reading he was named one of the top ten shredders in GuitarOne magazine. I honestly prefer both his playing and song writing to Malmsteem. Not only is his playing flawless, no surprise, but the tunes are more melodic than a lot of other heavy guitar players. Stump can obviously play anything he wants on the guitar and he is the equal of the very best, the cream of the crop. Fortunately his tunes are listenable and his guitar sounds GREAT, very meaty yet never muddy. Listen to this one on a good stereo system or headphones for maximum impact and enjoyment. I will definitly buy additional Stump CDs, but for now I am busy enjoying Supersonic Shred Machine."
2,Fun for a few minutes but gets too hard,"Joe Blade was a rather fun game in which you searched all over this military compound looking for hostages. As a side-scrolling shooter it wasn't that violent as you only ever encountered a bad guy once in a while. Bizarrely, when you shot them they instantly became a pile of skull and bones that looked like a small white chicken to me. But I was about 8 when I played it.But a few minutes in (you had exactly 30 minutes and counting to complete it) the game got so difficult that I never got any further. I'm talking about the bomb you had to defuse by breaking some kind of code. It was impossible and you only got sixty seconds to do it in. If it weren't for that I'm sure I would have played Joe Blade for much longer.The Commodore Amiga version had much, much better graphics btw.Graphics B-Sound B-Gameplay CLasting Appeal C+"
5,Cleanly-recorded display of conceptual brilliance,"To me this is a great album (and the last great one they recorded up until 1995).The music is strange and dark, but retains energy and tight construction. Elements of grunge, surf, prog-rock, goth, pop and other musics surround Smith's poetry. It coalesces much better on this enhanced UK running order than it did on the associated 1986 US LP release (""Domesday Triad Plus"").Not every track here is brilliant, but most are."
5,Huevos 2,this movie is great lots of hardcore riding and also some crazy stuff form The Bee(Harold Goodman) if you are into atv's this is defenatly a must have
2,Only for Herion Addicts,"This video was meant for people with addiction, preferably heroin,crack etc. but I found it very offensive when this man talked about another race, I can not show this to my clients. I have wasted my money on this, too bad I can't return it."
1,Living in Recovery,"I bought this tape to show in alcohol and drug classes. After reviewing the tape, I realized I could not show it to my class, because it has a somewhat racial undertone. Not a good film at all to show to a wide range of individuals."
2,Wrong title given,"The actual title to this movie is ""Carnaval en Veracruz"" which was filmed on location in the cities of Jalapa and Veracruz in 1940. The main characters are Manuel Medel, Agustín Izunza, and Eufrosina García. This is not a Cantinflas movie per se, though he is featured in the movie. Mario Moreno clips were actually edited into the movie. Mario sued causing a delayed release. If you will notice, Manuel and Mario are not seen together interacting in the movie. They were a great team in the late 30s (Así es mi tierra, Águil o sol, and El signo de la muerte). Too bad it was short lived. As for the DVD itself, I have the one released by ""Rebel Crew"". As mentioned by another reviewer, the audio is completely dubbed and poorly done. The scenes are very dark. The cover should feature the 3 main characters! If the original audio is available, this movie should be digitally remastered. I gave it only 2 stars because of the DVD quality."
5,New audio track,"I am sure back in 1941 this was a wonderful movie. Now has been dubbed and the new audio track has replaced the original sound. That is awful because most of the comedy relied on the original voices and now has lost some of the appealing. Adding to that, the songs are not the same they sing in the movie and God knows what else is not the same as before, maybe even the script. I say this because of the lip sync, which shows the Trio singing something completely different from what you hear.The movie is good (if you are not to picky, though) and is in spanish. The quality is not very good, what means they only replaced the audio but didnt improve the video... too bad..."
2,Half of the book is total interletual bull....,"Some twist, not really stories, especially the last one. The whole is dreamed up, and the whole book is trying to manipulate the readers."
2,"cute, but cheap","Quality is kind of what I expected from a costume...only made to wear once. The fringe isn't as full as the picture shows, a lot of the lycra sheath shows through and is see-through.Also, it fits really small. I wear a medium or a large in most things and I ordered a large to be on the safe side to fit my larger chest...but I can barely shimmy it on over my hips! Not enough time to return so I guess I'll be wearing spanx and sucking in at my costume party."
1,Horrid,"I bought this so-called costume and i had so many problems with it. Problem number one: the size is all wrong. I am usually in a large, but this time I decided to just make sure it would fit. I could not even get this dress over my torso. I ended up giving it to my size 6 roommate who was able to fit into perfectly, not too big and not too small, but we then ran into the second problem: it sheds! Our room was littered with strings of the dress here and there. It was simply atrocious!!! It was simply horrid!!"
3,Just right for a costume party!,"If buying this strictly for an inexpensive costume option, then this dress is worth it. The sizing runs a bit small (as other reviewers mentioned) so order up a size (or two) if you want to be comfortable. Also, please note the fringe is a bit fragile so you can expect to lose a string or two in the course of the evening. Otherwise it was just right for a flapper costume on a budget."
2,very cheap,"I usually wear a size 2 and i ordered a small- the top was almost too big but around my hips and butt was tiny! no room to move at all. Also, i ordered it in white and a word of warning- it is very see through! The whole dress also looks extremely cheap and im almost afraid it will fall apart but i need it for a party so will be wearing it anyway."
4,One time only...,"I liked the flapper costume. But, be warned it is very tight fitting - I was thankful that I bought a size larger than I usually would. It also is a costume & is not very well made - so strings were falling off of it the entire time I was wearing it. It was a fun costume, but probably only good for this one year."
5,Exactly what I needed,"I wasn't expecting too much from all the reviews I looked at. However, I was surprised at the durability of this costume. It's perfect! I loved it! Every time I wear it I feel woman empowered. It was perfect for my cabaret :)"
2,Run incredibly small,"I ordered a small and had to send it back. I wear a 2/4 and I couldn't get it over my shoulders. I replaced it with a medium, but it is still incredibly tight and has no give in the fabric."
3,Eh,"The pricing is right for the quality. The fringe falls out & stretches. The size chart may not be accurate, little too small for me, but I made it work. I would not order it again, but it did serve its purpose & I threw it away after my event."
3,Sizing needs to be corrected,"The dress itself is decent, especially for the price. If it had fit I definitely would have been very pleased. Unfortunately the sizing is ridiculously off. I normally wear a 4-6 and ordered the Medium (8-10) since most reviews warned that it runs small. I figured even if it were loose that'd be fine bc that kind of goes with the flapper style anyway. I could barely get it past my chest and the hips were not gonna happen. Honestly, I'm not that curvy so this was a shock. Sadly, I had to return. I wish they had more accurate sizing bc now I'm too hesitant to buy any of the California Costumes items."
2,Runs small,"This dress runs small. I am a 6 and I ordered the small which was to fit sizes 5-7 however it fit like a 4 slightly too small. make sure you get 1 size bigger because they will not exchange this product you will have to send back, and reorder another size."
4,Bought For A Long-distance Friend,"And shipped directly to her. She wasn't as impressed as I thought she'd be; but that may just be her personal taste (for a Halloween thing)... I saw visuals; I myself liked it on her, seemed to be good quality."
3,Definitely order a size up,"I am a solid medium in everything I wear, but I had to return the medium and exchange it for a large. Even the large was tighter on the bottom than I would have preferred. The bottom portion where the fringe is sewn on doesn't stretch at all, so getting it over your thighs and hips is snug. It's made of ""costume"" material so don't expect anything fancy, but it certainly does the trick for a costume party for $20. Just in case you didn't read the description it only comes with the dress and the headband, I ordered a boa and gloves separately (from Hong Kong for cheap) but they still haven't arrived a month later...but that's what I get for being cheap!"
3,Black fringed fashion flapper,"Really good quality costume but sizes a little on the smaller side, otherwise very happy"
4,Great but snug,"Costume was great, I went with other suggestions and ordered a size up. I ordered a Medium and it was snug but fit perfect. I am 5'9'' and wear a size small top and 28 (4 or 6) pants. Headband was a little snug but made the costume!"
2,Not true to size,"Costume looked good when I got it out of the package.The material is 100% synthetic and a bit see through, and it sheds (the tassels). But I wasn't expecting much from a $20 costume.I would have kept it but the size is way off. I ordered the x-large, which is supposed to be size 14 - it's not!I'm a size 14 and I could barely fit into it- let alone wear it. Also since the material is 100% synthetic, it has no elasticity at all, so even if it was my size - it's a hassle to put on/ take off.I had to return it :("
3,Runs small,"This dress is sized very small. I am usually a medium and ordered a medium but it is extremely tight fitting. Also, cheaply made. I put it on for the first time and about 5 of the fringe fell off. Definitely a one time use sort of dress."
4,good price,The dress was purchased for a fancy dress/ costume party. It was thinner than expected but good price for a one time use item.
2,SHORT!!!,"Runs small, runs tight, is extremely short. Definitely a halloween costume. I made it work with black spanx-- otherwise it would have been totally indecent. Its very flattering because of the fringe placement, so even though i felt like I was wearing lingerie, i got LOTS of compliments."
3,Great for kids in school.,"Simak's book is not for advanced readers, but it is great for kids in school. When teaching the fantasy genre, it has incredible applications. The simple characters are easy to understand, giving the book a logical progression, while generating ample discussion on their interractions. A previous reviewer mentioned that the characters have only one characteristic (An understatement), but for a critical thinking exercise students can identify and define characters by observing their actions and interractions. To teachers who struggle with fantasy books which students can not engage in due to alien ideas and complex plots, I readily reccomend this book!"
5,truly is an LCD screen saver,"One of the things I hate most is buying an expensive camera, only to deface the area that you look at the most: the screen. I was sketchy about buying this screen protector, as it didn't have any reviews for it yet. It is very easy to apply onto the screen. You don't have to worry about dust, fingerprints, scratches or anything! Best of all, it's reusable and you can gently wash it if needed. The lint-free cloth that comes along with it is extremely useful as well. The only downside to this product is trying to remove the protector from the screen; however, there isn't much reason to, if you install it properly."
3,"Enjoyable second-season ""Outer Limits"" effort.","This oddly-titled second-season ""Limits"" episode is mostly a missed opportunity, though the effective moments make it worth watching. The idea is great--a two-dimensional being (Eck, who else?) ends up in our three-dimensional world by accident and seeks the help of a scientist who happens to have a special pair of glasses that render the otherwise invisible being viewable. Unfortunately, the episode can't decide whether it wants to be a comedy or a drama, and it ends up not being much of either. Still, the special effects are great, if you can accept the cartoonish appearance of Eck, and the lab scenes have some of the first-season mysterioso. The director, believe it or not, is Byron Haskin, best-known for ""War of the Worlds,"" ""Robinson Crusoe on Mars,"" and the Disney ""Treasure Island."" Haskin despised this episode, claiming that it harmed his TV directoral career."
2,"OK TV, lousy customer service","I have this for about 3 months. I use it mainly as computer monitor. Picture quality is good, but customer service is quite lousy. There is no firmware update or no plan for firmware update. One of the deficiencies with this unit is inability to save some of the settings. You will have to set the primary and secondary video sources every time you use PIP. I called customer service, and was told if that is what I have to do, that is what I will have to do every time!! If you have no plan of using customer service, this is probably for you."
2,"Great product, horrible support","We have had our LVM-37W3 for some time, and it's been mostly good - good features, good picture. However, it's had one annoyance: it has a tendency to switch inputs randomly at least once after each time it has been turned on (usually twice). Pick up the remote, switch it back. Not the worst problem, but really irritating.Now, we've seen other reports of this on the internet saying that this is solved by a firmware upgrade. But calling Westinghouse Digital's support is pretty much a waste of time. They refuse to admit that there are firmware upgrades. Their only answer is to ship the unit back and they'll send us a different refurbished one.We keep calling, hoping to get someone who is a little more helpful. But alas, still no luck. The last time we called the person actually suggested that our remote control was ""leaking"" signals that the monitor was picking up, and suggested that we move the remote to the garage to see if the problem went away. Sigh."
3,5 years and counting,I have had this unit since 2008 xmas. Only few issues:1)Vga sync rate is below 60Hz2)I have a bit of burn in where I watch 4:3 aspect ratio television.3)Only 1 Hdmi connector.4) Built in speaker are weak and inaccurate. (Not a big issue I use the home theater sound system.)Otherwise this thing has been great and I still would recommend to anyone of a low budget.You people who got DOA units. Might want to blame delivery issues where they belong the retailer and the shipping company.
1,Craft book,I bought this book to generate ideas of things to do with my photos. I was underwhelmed with the book.
1,Don't buy this book here...they are way over priced!,I can't believe the price the two sellers are trying to get for this book; $50 and $99. Outrageous. Do yourself a favor and go to [...]. It's exactly the same book at a cost to you of only $16. Now you understand why I'm amazed at how some people try to take advantage of others. I do buy quite a few books here at Amazon.com and have considered most to be a good deal. [...]
3,Hard to follow,"This book could be difficult for a beginner. The diagrams are sometimes hard to follow. So, I wouldn't buy this one as your first book on clock repair."
3,Necessary?,"I bought this item thinking that it was imperative to use along with a trainer. However, the amount of decline from the trainer is negligible. It doesn't offer anything that a 2x4 or a modest-sized book you have in your home couldn't do if you felt that you needed the incline."
2,Is this necessary?,"I purchased the block because it was recommended to go with an indoor trainer. I received my indoor trainer and love it, but not sure why I need the block. I thought it may be to hold the front wheel steady, but it seems fine without a block. Looking at the block I decided it must be to raise the front wheel up, but my wheel does not need raising. I quess some people need the block, but it is not for everyone."
1,Still waiting - would love to rate on it's merits,I am still waiting for this to be delivered.I have the trainer but cannot use it withough the stabilizer.
4,great,Bought this item for my husband for Christmas. The quality is very good and it was exactly what I expected.
2,made for all sizes,"Product is made for just about any size bike tire, so if you have wider tires it will be a little more stable than if you have road tires. Would just like a road version and a wide version."
3,Stable but doesn't level the bike,"The block does a good job of securing the front wheel and providing a stable platform. However, it's not tall enough to level the road bike I've used hooked up to a Blackburn trainer. The only way to get a comfortable riding position is to stack a good thick phone directory underneath the stabilizer ... the older style, really thick and wide phone books work best."
2,Not very stable,"After buying this I wish I had bought a heavier, more sturdy one. It works Ok on carpet or rug, but otherwise will slide all over the floor and come out from under the wheel at times."
2,Disappointed,"Having purchased similar products in the past, you'd think I'd learn, but no, I did it again. This product disappoints because no one has the unlimited time to do each individual hair...for twice to three times longer than the instructions state, and then end up tweezing it anyway."
1,INEFFECTIVE PRODUCT- Do not buy!,"This ""wand"" did not work. Please do not order this product, it is a waste of both time and money."
1,buyer beware,"i wish i'd seen the previous reviews before i purchased this item. i can't even agree with the one more favourable review because it says you have to hold the hair two or three times longer than the directions say. however, it is my experience that you can hold the hair forever and it will still never do anything. i held several hairs much longer than directions said. and yet when i went to twist the hair out afterwards, it was just as painful as simply tweezing. to say this product is a waste of money and time is still going too easy on it. i am beyond disappointed."
2,OVERALL SCORE: (C-),"Slow, boring, predictable, and the hero is silly and self-absorbed. Also the dialogue is dull and shallow. But, besides that........{Try, Paul S. Kemp's ""Shadow's Witness"" (Forgotten Realms: Sembia series, Book 2)"" or ""Twilight Falling"" (Forgotten Realms: The Erevis Cale Trilogy, Book 1) these are really good books!}OVERALL SCORE: (C-)PLOT: (C-), CHARATERS: (C-), DIALOGUE: (C-), SETTING: (C), ACTION/COMBAT: (C-), ANTAGONISTS: (B-), ROMANCE: (B-), AGE LEVEL: (PG)"
3,Not bad,"This book had some real potential, but it sort of de-railed along the way. While it has a great start and a killer villain. However, once Tazi leaves Sembia the story goes from great to mediocre. A once greatly malicious villain turns into your average nasty schmoe and the novle just degenerates into a standard hack and slash unbtil you get to the end of the story type book.While not bad, this is definately the low point in the Sembian series, which means it is still good, just not as good as the rest of them."
2,Not as good as the rest of the series,"This feels like a short story which has been stretched. Not enough happens, and as has been remarked, the villain is not terribly credible. The plotting doesn't hang together all that well, while the description of Calimport will seem a bit uncomfortable to those who visited it in the company of R.A.Salvatore. Is this the city ruled by Pasha Pook?The character of Tazi is interesting, and I'd been looking forward to this volume. It's OK-ish. I'd just hoped for something more involving."
2,Dull and lacking imagination,"Just not a very interesting story. I had to read it to finish the series, but it is a sub par read."
2,Will not buy DLink again,"Everything started off rosey with this switch until a port died 2 months after I got it. I RMA'd it and the replacement switch took so long to get here I bought a Negear GS-605 to hold me over.Once the replacement finally got there, I attempted to hook it up to the other switched and it refused (tried both crossover and normal cables, ports, etc). Sure it would sync the link at 1Gb/s but it refused to actaully pass tcp/ip packets.I double checked the manual (which conflicted with the online Knowledge Base) and still nothing. I then verfied the other switch would connect to some other switches I had lying around and it worked just fine. So the D-Link was most definately the culprit and only actually worked problem free for 2 months.The netgear is working great and I am picking up another one today to replace this shoddy D-Link product."
2,Runs too hot,"I bought this switch when it came out a few years ago. It was one of the first gigabit switches available for a reasonable price (below $100). It worked fine with many of my home systems. But it just ran too damn hot. The plastic case really didn't help. It ran so hot that it became the favorite sleeping spot for one of my cats. I have tons of electronics in the house, but this is the one she chose. Of course, that caused the Dlink switch to run even hotter. It finally died a few months ago. I replaced it with a Trendnet which has a metal case and runs much cooler."
1,Bland,"Soup is very bland, it made the slice of white bread I had with it seem spicy. No real chunks of vegetables, just a couple mushy beans. 2 pea size bits of tomatoes, and zero tomato juice in the base, no garlic/onion or anything with flavor in the stock. Would recommend a warm glass of water instead."
4,Sampler #1,"I love Camille Beckman hand cream. However, very few stores carry it and the ones that do have a limited selection. The sampler is a great way to find your favorite scent. Camille and Rozalia are the highlights of this collection. Camille has a slightly soapy smell and Rozalia has a flowery baby-powder smell. French vanilla and white lilac are okay and smell like you'd expect. I'll definitely pass on Mango Beach in the future--it's just too strong and the smell doesn't fade."
3,Sexy literature,You have to be in the mood to read this. I only bought it to read and see if the author of 50 Shades of Grey had been influenced by the Marquis de Sade.
4,A great Bauhaus cd to start with,"This is the first Bauhaus cd I heard. I was interested in hearing them and I stumbled across it at a used cd store. So I picked it up and have enjoyed it since. My favorite tracks include ""Double Dare,"" ""In the flat field,"" and ""Stigmata Martyr."" Bauhaus were definately ahead of their time with their creative guitar riffs and effects, they not only wrote great music but created an atmosphere with the music. This is a collection of their singles and it make you wanting more."
3,Fine Cd,"Bought this a few weeks back but I was slightly disapointed when I realized that most of the songs on this album were taken from Swing The Heartache, The BBC Sessions...but honestly, I didn't mind much because the additonal songs that were inculded with it were one's that I hadn't heard yet (My collection of Bauhaus is depressingly small) so I feel that it was still worth it."
2,"Great Music, Redundant Release","The review has nothing to do with the actual music, which is great. Rather, it's the ""best of"" collection status. It's really a redundant waste. Just buy In the Flat Fields and The Mask, and you have all that's on this ""Volume 1"" and more. Maybe at the time, they weren't available on CD, but they are now. GET THE COOL ORIGINALS!"
1,Bad quality and non adequate contents,I was expecting to see some things much better about the bio of one of my Favorite players in the basketball. But the contents nor the quality of the pictures were not up to my expectations. I am afraid this item doesn't worth it's money value
5,Wonderful book,"I will keep this short, because I second Mr. McAnulty review, which was well said. I would add that I've read a lot and this is easily in my top 3 all time favorites (not counting the Holy Bible). I will soon be buying copies for my sisters and several friends. May God bless you."
5,"Extremely good, especially for beginners!","I am a beginner in regards to planting/growing succulents. I bought this book and it has helped me tremendously. This book talks about and provides color pictures of many different types of succulents. Also, there is information on propigating, common problems, growing size, preferred temperature, and even how to display different succulents so as to get the most visual pleasure from them. I refer to this book often, and recommend it to anyone wishing to begin a succulent garden. Thanks to this book I now have a beautiful garden!"
3,knowing succulent plants,"This book is for plant people and is printed in England. The English have a little different take from the American plant people. The book is rather small, the print is small and so are the pictures. Therefore, it is difficult to read for those who need a larger print. I was a little disappointed in it because of the smallness of the content."
2,Disappointed,"I received the book in a timely manner, but for the cost of this item I expected better. The book was about 5 x 7 inches and the type is so small I need a magnifying glass to read it (no exaggeration). The book also had a price tag on it listing the price as $6.95. I paid substantially more. When I pay this much for a book (since I've always gotten a larger, easier read copy in good condition) I was expecting the same. It would have been nice to know the dimensions in advance."
3,Lost in da shuffle,"Empirion's one and only (to my knowledge) album ""Advanced Technology"" doesn't break any new ground, although I give the band full marks for naming all their sources/inspirations in the liner notes.This is a fully functional--albeit extremely minimalist--electronica album that will be considered by many to be extremely boring. But I found it no less impressive than anything by Photek or the Jungle Brothers in their prime, so take it as you will."
1,weak Eminem song,"This track is really quite annoying. I didn't like the original song either, though, so it's no putdown to Eminem. Regularly he is quite good and one of only two rap groups I like."
2,Pretty generic,"Unimaginative hook, and Em sounds like he's about to fall asleep halfway through the track. How many times is Em going to rap about his daughter before Dre tells him it's getting old?"
4,Beautiful book,This book has lots of beautiful photographs which depict conifers in their mature size and shape. The book is inspiring but has an incomplete plant list. The author lists the most common varieties. A common problem with plant book is that it is hard to keep up with the new stock. I bought four new conifers this year that were not listed in the book. I would have liked to have seen some advise or planting designs on which conifers work well together. Overall it is a very inspirational book.
4,Better than original,This pump is better than the original pump(AO Smith) that came with pool which only lasted 2 seasons. This pump is much quieter than the other pumps that I've had on this pool.
4,Great Price,"Received the pump in a few days after ordering. Could not pass up the price and so far I am very happy with how quiet it operates. Can't give five stars, need to see how it handles a few seasons."
1,This pump lasted 1 year 1 month and they refused to replace it.,Never again this is a terrible pump replaced twice. I had it checked by a pool repair company they said Waterway pumps are poorly designed and corrode around the inside of the pump which is what causes them do stop working. We only had our last pump for 1 year and 1 month STAY AWAY FROM WATERWAY!! POOLTOWN CARED LESS BUT WERE MORE THAN WILLING TO TAKE MORE OF OUR MONEY. Waterway refused to warranty item to replace even though it was only used for 3 months stored in the garage during the winter.
5,Best deal around,"This is a great motor/pump/basket combo. Durable, quiet yet powerful, serviceable.I learned from the last one, though -- don't let pool water (with chemicals, esp. Cl) splash onto the shaft end of the motor. There are cooling vents there where the water can enter. Rainwater won't hurt, but the pool water will corrode the armature. When corrosion builds up, it will start scraping the sides and eventually lock up.This is not a Waterway problem, but I wish they'd make a shield to go over that. I've moved it further from the skimmer, and asked my wife not to splash when dumping the basket, but swimmers will still splash."
1,Cheap pump,"I have had to replace 2 of these pumps in 2 years. Poor quality, when this next one goes out, and I'm sure it will, I will spend the money for a Hayward"
5,Meta Given's Modern Encyclopedia of Cooking - One volume complete,This old cook book is absolutely wonderful. I love all the explanations of how to prepare different foods and the simple recipes that are so easily accomplished without a lot of fancy ingredients. Made me think of my childhood and I just absolutely love this book.
3,This is only cause...,this cd might be good might be bad i gave it a 3 cause duffy is my dog's name and that's cool if they want to have duffy power.Go Dufffffffffy!
1,"what Marty A. Silvert ""pogodog"" said","horrible, please see the well worded review by Marty A. Silvert ""pogodog."" the plot is awful, the acting should not have been paid for, and the fights were the same - bad."
2,Not so great,It is a sloooowwwww starter. After getting through the initial boredom and obvious fake drama it gets interesting in the end.
4,Good historical drama,This review is for the Amazon VOD rental of this film. This is a fairly goodhistorical drama. It has been quite some time since I have seen a film starringChristopher Lambert and and he is very good in this one. Blanca Marsillach is abeautiful actress and does quite well playing a women trying to hide her past. Ithink this film is well worth the VOD rental price.
3,Day of Wrath,"The time is during the Spanish Inquisition and the setting is a tumultuous Spain. It is considered acceptable for the church to execute heretics which includes Jews. There have been several murders of noblemen in a village that the local sheriff, played by Thomas Jane, is investigating. As he unravels the motives there are a few red herrings that twist and turn the case making it far more complicated than he would have ever imagined. When he approaches religious and government officials they seem to have no interest in his findings, and to make matters worse his evidence keeps disappearing. His own demons from his past are not helping him prove his reliability. Good quality DVD with only bare minimum of features. If you enjoyed this catchThe Name of the Rose.CA Luster"
3,"The movie exist, thats about it","Checking out the latest flick with Christopher Lambert, I must say that I wish he would re-invent himself, revive his career like Sean Connory did by going into Dramas. The movie Gideon was decent. Here, he plays a sherrif of a town in Spain in 1542. I swear they stuck him in the role because the still think he can swing a sword like ""the Highlander"". They really needed a younger character for the part, he almost looked older than the person who was playing the Govenor, who we find out is his uncle. But the movie just didn't grab the attention that the story could have, and that was probably just the scripwriting. And the swordwork, I agree with some of the other reviews, just not crisp, like the kings/govenors soldiers had never practiced. At times it looked like two kids in a backyard fighting with twigs. And then the Movie ended, fairly predicatble, but just not very satisfying. The movie was just that, a movie, not horribly bad, but nothing to rush out and get."
1,worst movie i have ever seen,this movie is SO bad. it is almost laughable at points (like when someone dies in the most awkward way ever from hitting their head after falling down three stairs.) would not pay 50 cents for it. on the cover it looks like the guy from frasier... yeah terrible.
2,"Hungary 1, Filmakers 0","This mishmash of a plot, wanna-be gruesome FX and hack acting is well worth watching for two reasons: the excellent period sets and costumes found in Hungary, and the presence of our son Ben O'Brien, a fine young actor and school teacher in Budapest. Of course, that is just the opinion of proud parents!"
5,To nkroachment: Yarbles!,"A raucous, rough and ready riot of garage rock from start to finish, 'This Nation' veers between the brash, unfinished amateurism of 'Bombast' and 'Spoilt Victorian child' to the highly produced and polished sound of 'LA' and 'Petty (thief) lout'. This is without doubt The Fall's finest sixty minutes, with Mark E Smith's vivid, twisted take on the everyday in overdrive (cf 'Couldn't get ahead's strange rant about queuing up for an aeroplane toilet; one of the few tracks with easily discernible lyrics).Every song here is up to scratch, with none of the sloppy filler tracks of later albums. This nation's saving grace? Well, with this album The Fall come damn close."
4,OY,"Perfect pub music for bruisers with bad teeth and sharp minds. Edgy, jarring, melodic, a little bit of everything. Makes you want to pour your Guiness over Thatcher's head."
5,an easy 5 stars,"i loved the fall's early years compilation, _totally wired_, but it was just a little too grating to support repeated listenings. i gave them a second chance to completely win me over with this record--allegedly their best--and they didn't disappoint. i mean, it may still be punk, but these tunes right here are catchy...and mark smith's vocals are a phenomenon not to be missed."
4,the most perfect of the imperfect,"This Fall album (if you are a fall-head) is probably the most accessible of their (his) albums, though I only(!) own 4 of the Fall's albums. I have played this for people who think Limp Bizkit is a ""dangerous"" and ""alternative"" group (I am loathe to admit I associate with such types but one shan't be a bigot), and they love it. Thank God for the Fall. I can't give it 5 stars because as it's been said before, there is no perfect Fall album, they tend to f*** around a lot. However, to quote the anti-great Mark E. Smith, they do ""not jam!"". This ain't the grateful dead folks, although it maybe them in the other universe which exists exactly 180 degrees out of phase with the frequency of ours!"
5,The door to the temple of wisdom,"There is a lot going on here. It sounds different every time I hear it. It's the first Leon Redbone album I bought. I bought it in 3 different formats, trying to find one that sounded bright. But it just wasn't mastered that way, and there is a reason for that. It's intentionally dark. It has an opacity that begins to enhance the material after a few listens. This is perhaps his best album. ""Sheik Of Araby"" is a unique, unaccompanied virtuoso performance and is worth the price of admission all by itself. ""Shine On Harvest Moon"" is eerie perfection. ""Winin' Boy Blues"" is the climax of the whole production, a bit of heaven, sent by Leon's vocal and Bob Greene's masterful piano."
5,A wicked princess and a sensitive guy,"This is Laura Kinsale's best story. This a story that surprises from beginning to end. The characters are amazing and intresting. They are deffinately well created, so much so that it makes you think that the characters must be real. The main characters are unique, they are a wicked princess and a sensitive guy. You must read this story it is the best!"
1,What Happened?,I have read every one of Laura Kinsale's books and have loved them all...up until now. I have been forcing myself to finish this book. The characters are one dimensional and have no redeeming characteristics at all! I was all set to jump into another set of Kinsale's great characters but found myself stuck with a witchy heroine and a hero with no will of his own. I look forward to reading more of her work and I can just hope that they will be more comparable in quality to all her others!!
2,Not low-cut enough,"These liners are not as low-cut as some others I've tried. They show when wearing most of the shoes I was hoping to wear with them - these liners show on both sides and a bit at the toe area. I have some Hue liners that are lower cut and do not show. I cannot find these Hue liners online and they are difficult to find in stores, so I was hoping these Bershire liners would be just as good, but they are not. They are comfortable and of good quality, but I think the name of the product is misleading. If your shoes cover most of your foot, these may be okay. However, I think these liners would show when worn with most ballet flats, typical flats and heels."
1,I'd Give This Zero Stars If I Could!,"Don't waste your time buying this DVD! It is as shoddy a piece of journalism as you'll ever find. Frankly, the piece could have been done twenty years ago -- it sheds no new light on the subject whatsoever. The ""experts"" have little expertise and their ideas are outmoded at best. If you're looking for insights into autism and how to best help a child you know (whether you know or just suspect that they may have an autism spectrum disorder), I urge you to buy the DVD ""Healing Autism: A Breakthrough Approach with Kenneth Bock, M.D."""
4,Haunting,"I read this because it was recommended by Jonathan Lethem. Well, he was right. It deserves to be read. Sort of an oneiric experience. Well written, and after WTC massacre it gained a weird realistic quality--especially the ending part. 'Tis a pity the author devoted himself to nonfiction."
4,Pretty Good,"I received these shoes a couple weeks ago. They seem exactly like any other skateboarding shoes. They are cushioned and nicely padded. The description on this page is 100% accurate. The only problem I have with these shoes is that after tucking the laces in, they fall out of my shoe after about 10 minutes of walking."
5,excellent,"I agree with the other reviewers - This is a wonderful novel set in New York and dealing with a group of friends and the onset of the AIDS crisis. It is well written, perceptive, and very moving. I would highly recommend it."
4,Time will tell,"I bought this for a 9wk old rottweiler puppy. Its a little big for her to enjoy now but I am sure she will enjoy it in the coming weeks as she grows. Only time will tell on how it will hold up, I got it because it was top rated for my breed."
5,Never Need Replaced,I got a pack of seven and I went all summer only using the same one. They never fall apart and they are very durable and long-lasting. They are very cheap and I would recommend this to anyone.
4,Lasts Forever,This is a very good birdie for the price. It just never gets worn out.Buts it up to you to decide whether you wanna play with nylon birdies. Most of my friends and the members at the club always prefer the feather ones. So I aint using these much anyway.
1,Dyslexic professional at mid- career,I found this book to be simplistic and of no use. I am older than its target audience which seems to be 15-18. Do not by this book if you are looking for serious career advice.
5,Easy fun,"This music is easy to read on the piano, yet complicated enough that it sounds good for accompying a vocalist. I play piano and sing, and I have enjoyed playing the songs while singing them, even though some of the notes are too low for me to hit."
3,Read Product Description Carefully,"The product description describes both this product and another product (actually the one I was looking for), instead of limiting itself to coverage of the product on whose page it appears, which is just stupid. This item is the watered down arrangement with the melody artificially inserted into the accompaniment. The listing title is vague, so a more thorough study of the product description is required to understand exactly what you are purchasing.Also, I realize that this is more of a review of the listing quality than the product quality. I will also say that I have scanned the music and have found it to be as disappointing as I would usually expect this type of arrangement to be. If, however, you do not sing, and want to hear the melody while you are playing the piano part, then this is for you."
4,"Everything it advertises, but hard!","This book is exactly what is in the description, but is harder than I expected. I really needed a step between easy piano and this!"
5,Wicked,"Wicked is my favorite musical. The music is inspiring. And although at times the music can be dificult to master, it's nothing that a little practice can't solve."
4,Good Piano Arrangements,"I really liked the Easy Piano Arrangment book of ""Wicked."" The keys and rhythms are very user friendly and good for the young piano player. I have also purchased the harder piano arrangement version, but found some of the keys to be trickier and therefore somewhat more frustrating to play. I also like having the words included, so someone could easily sing the part as a vocal solo or just a piano solo. Overall it is nice arrangment of some trickier modern music."
5,Love the music,"I love Wicked and really think the whole show story and music is genius. I use this book to teach out of. Just know that you really need to play well to play these songs. There are lots of key changes, sharps and flats. I warm my students up first with:Voice Lessons To Go's -Vocalize!"
5,Another great gift,Another great gift for my daughter. She loved the music after singing it for choir class.
5,Phenominal score,"Wicked is fabulous on every level. Just know that this score is not easy to play from if you are not a good piano player. Also as voice teacher, prepare yourself for a lot of students who will not be able to even touch the high belt required for some of these songs!Check Out:Vocalize!"
5,Music,Our favorite musical. Daughter got a keyboard for Christmas and I wanted to get her the songs to try to learn!
1,no,I bought the wrong movie and this was too scary for me. I meant to buy the one where the wife poisens her husband with fish guts that makes him have a fake heart-attack and they (her lover doctor) bury him alive but the dog unburies him.Thanks anyway.
2,Not missing much,"Buried Alive revolves around a group of college kids who soon learn that the demonic spirit of a woman murdered in their vacation house is out for blood, and guess who's in her axe-wielding sights? Robert Kurtzman, best known as partner to gore effects gurus Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger (hence, KNB Effects) and the original scripter for From Dusk Till Dawn, directs Buried Alive, and sadly it comes off as another derivative, uninspired slasher flick that provides little in the way of scares or suspense. The acting is atrocious and the story is cliche and oh so predictable (for the most part), but Buried Alive does have a few good moments of note, including some nifty gore effects and a small role from Saw's Tobin ""Jigsaw"" Bell, who himself up's the creep factor just by appearing on film. All in all, Buried Alive may be worth a look for die hard slasher fans, but those that don't see it won't be missing much at all either."
4,Horrofic fun!,"Buried Alive promised so much on the write up on the back and to a point it did deliver.Basic story of amorous college girls and guys go away for a good time and are unfortunate enough to walk straight into a scenario involving a dead chick out for blood and a creepy Tobin Bell. The axe-welding maniac from the grave manages to wreck havoc and along the way we get to see some nakedness so, no complaints really.Some of the kills are done off-screen which to me is not a major problem as there is a decent amount of gore still on offer. All in all I enjoyed this film and was happy enough to pay the 12 bucks to add it to my growing collection of b-grade and a-grade horrors."
1,ANOTHER WASTE......,A waste of my time and money. Possibly two good gore scenes (I only remember one) and thats all this thing is worth...
1,Eh...,"Buried Alive boasts 'legendary effects wizard Robert Kurtzman' in the director's seat, but that fact only seems to make the movie more of a slap in the face. In the director's seat, but obviously asleep most of the time, Kurtzman's effort here is a simple exercise in missed opportunities. Not to belabor the point or anything, but the gore is cookie cutter (when there is any at all), and it almost seems like the director is reluctant to kill off any of his characters. Half of the deaths occur off-camera. Weak.What could have been a sleazy, trashy, and brilliantly gory (given Kurtzman's other work), if not necessarily inspired, tribute to 80's slashers ends up being not much fun at all. One star for not really trying."
1,pass,"This is simply one of those movies that you wish someone warned you about. If you're hardcore about your large film collection and pick up just about anything you can find for next to $ nothing, you probably already have or seen this one. If not, there are 100's of thousands of other movies out there to explore. The movie just doesn't work. My tastes run far and wide - but this one is added to the list of movies I can't seem to enjoy on any level. These sort of movies embarrass me. Skip it - The dimension extreme series is a better blind gamble than masters of horror or after dark horror fest. And way better than most of that ghosthouse crap. This one? pass. . ."
3,Disappointment,"This is not a Labyrinth album,it is so different from all their other albums.It is a much slower album,not enough shredding,and half the album is a ballad turn into metal or metal turn into ballad.They have some rock on the album which I don't like.Listen to Face And Pay,during the middle of the song before the solo they have rock in it (pure seventies rock,jazz sound).Once you hear the album you will be blown away by how different it is in a good way or a bad way,but whatever you do don't buy the cd with the dvd(limited edition), if your from U.S.A.or Canada because the dvd doesn't work,it says wrong region.I bought this a year ago and got rid of it because the dvd didn't work,if anyone has this or bought it recently and the dvd works please write a review and let me know if it works.READ MY OTHER REVEIW FOR THIS ALBUM IF YOU WANT MORE DETAIL."
4,movie,Several of my friends have watched it and they commented that they had no idea of the trials that the handcatr pioneers endured. Good movie.
5,Mingus and Beyond,"I think this is my favorite Mingus album. It's got it all - wonderful tunes and virtuoso performances. But where do you go from here? Mingus put out a lot of amazing music. Some of it is rather challenging and not for the timid, but I recommend the following without hesitation, especially if you're a fan of Mingus Ah Um.Blues and Roots, Mingus Dynasty - both also from 1959, one of his greatest years, Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus - just spectacular, Tijuana Moods - one his most emotional and swinging albums, Black Saint and the Sinner Lady - one of the most daring (yet swinging) jazz concept albums, Let My Children Hear Music - a true masterpiece of composition and performance, and Live in Antibes - one of his best live albums featuring Eric Dolphy."
5,Perfection Achieved.,"If you own one work by Mingus this must be it. Mingus if he did nothing else, really showcased the art of Jazz as 'composition'.These tunes here are so well thought out, so structured, you so full of improvisation and free at the same time. I really wish Mingus would have played Boogie Stop Shuffle more often (like he did with Better Git...).Every song on here is just excellent, Mingus really makes the most of his 'big band' sound here, giving the music great dynamics and shadings."
5,Another Mingus Masterpiece,"Mingus Ah Um is a one of Mingus' greatest albums. It truly shows Mingus' musical genius, as a composer and bass player as well. A must have for everyone's jazz collection. A classic."
4,Get off-line and listen to this one!,"This is Mingus at his big band best. Boogie Stop Shuffle, if it doesn't ""git in your soul,"" git yourself to the hospital to check for a pulse!Recorded in NYC during the spring of 1959,the group of musicians assembled herein produces a work that is at once loose and tight, soft and loud, but man is it a snapshot of jazz at a vibrant time."
4,Very good,"I'm not a Jazz expert, so I don't feel quite right giving this album 4 stars since it's so highly rated by the experts. I like it, the tracks are light and easy to listen to. They're also varied and interesting enough to warrant many replays. However, as good as they are, I don't rate them as highly as some of the other works to which I've given 5 stars."
3,"Essential, Influential, But Overrated","Obviously, Mingus has had a huge influence on jazz with this and many other works of his- this doesn't mean it was very good, though. To each his own, obviously- like what you like- I just felt this album was just okay."
2,Very small puppet,"In reality, this puppet is very small; so small that my hand doesn't fit inside the mouth very well, thus it is very difficult to use. I had to abandon it and purchase a normal sized puppet and create the clothing. The good thing is that it was very cheap in price, so I don't feel that badly ripped off."
5,Great Classroom Puppet,"My brother bought this puppet for me to use in my Third Grade Classroom. Chef Al Dente was a hit the first time I used him to give a spelling test! (Having Chef Al Dente speak in an Italian accent helped!) I intend to purchase more Melissa and Doug puppets to add to my ""cast"" of characters!"
4,Good but could be better,"I got this doll for my collection and was so excited about it. Though when I got it, I didn't get what I was expecting. She was just like any other doll and to be honest the picture was far better than the real thing. It will make any girl happy, don't get me wrong, but it may not be the best doll you'll ever purchase."
3,Just OK,"I have just assembled the Shop Fox and everything seems to work OK with the exception of a belt making noise( I havent had time to investigate). Fairly easy to set up with minimal instructions. The quality I would rate as OK for the money ( could be better but not bad). The worst thing with this press was the packaging, I did have one of my thumb turns broke during shipment. Not a big problem or even worth raising with the seller. A package this heavy should definately be packaged better, the packaging is the same as you would find in a ceiling fan box."
5,"It is a p9owerful, well built drill that is designed to be exceptionally versatil.","What little I have used this drill press so far, I have been impressed with its construction, the ease of assembly, and the detail built into it. I'm very happy with it."
3,good tool,"I havent used my shop fox w1668 much lately, but i DO love the oscilating sander drums (which came with the drill). Ive only drilled a few holes with it, and i hope my bit is bent, otherwise the chuck wobbles like a duck. it has great power and speeds. it has a good solid weight and seems to turn smoothly with no strange noises. as soon as i get time to figure out this wobble thing ill be happy to make this review 5 stars."
3,It's OK.,"Others have related Grizzly and Shop Fox. Though they are currently owned by the same corporation it is not true that other than the paint job a Grizzly is a Shop Fox. The ""fit and finish"" everyone mentions is just one difference. The reason for the ""fit"" is higher quality components. That said if you are determined to get the Grizzly or the Shop Fox go for the Shop Fox for 2 reasons. 1) It is a better quality machine and 2) Shop Fox service is very good. Grizzly service is completely inflexible. Shop Fox will reply to e-mail within a day or two and SOLVE your issue. All this said my Delta benchtop drill press is better than the Grizzly or the Shop Fox."
4,A Great Litttle Drill Press,"The press was well packaged and undamaged. The instruction and assembly manual did not completely match the drill press I received. I guess, if you can't figure out how to put it together, you shouldn't be using it anyway. I have a small shop. Everything is on casters. For my shop, it's perfect. Easy to operate, change drill speeds and engage the oscillating feature. It comes with a set of sanding drums. The mounting hardware doesn't hold on to the sanding drum very well, but it works. I added a 3/4"" plywood deck to the adjustable platform for sanding and drilling larger stock. This helps in keeping your stock square to the drill or sanding drum. The oscillating feature works well, but you need to be careful how much pressure you place on the object you are sanding to keep from damaging the mechanism. Once you figure out the proper pressure on the sanding drum, the results are quite good. The extra money you pay for all the features is worth it."
2,DISAPPOINTED,I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR AT LEAST 5 YEARS & LOVE IT.I'VE HAD 2 BACK SURGERIES AND THIS HAS WORKED TO RELIEVE MY BACK PAIN.I WAS DISAPPOINTED TO FIND THAT THIS THERABEADS HEAT PACK IS SCENTED.I WOULD NOT HAVE ORDERED THIS PRODUCT IF I HAD BEEN AWARE OF THIS.I AM ALLERGIC TO SCENTS.
5,great product; fast service,great product; fast service---only problem was that I was not told it would be scented.
1,Great Product - LOUSY CUSTOMER SERVICE from BP SUPPLIES,"The Duro-med product we purchased was a ""PAIR (2) Duro-Med Therabeads Microwavable Moist Heat Pack Standard 9 x 12 with cover scented"" per the description on the BP Supplies website. Well they took a long time to process the order and when we got the product there were no covers for the Therabeads. We called BP Supplies and left messages and then spoke with their customer service people and they basically ignored us and told us too bad, we must have lost them. NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH PEOPLE WHO DON'T SUPPORT THEIR CUSTOMERS. The Therabeads are great and we have purchsed them many times with great results."
3,Review,"The price of the book was a blessing but it came damaged and that was unknown. I wish that was told before my purchase, that is all."
4,Its Draining Outside!,Gift for a family member with spout draining issues. Worked well and solved the problem!
2,Not that great,"Got it out and the plastic tie wrap broke instantly when I tried to install it. Strike one. Then it is difficult to install on down spout, strike two. Also it will not fully roll out unless a down pour is happening. However in a down pour it doesn't release water fast enough so water shots up around the bend in the down spout. I would only recommend if you live some where it doesn't rain allot and the rain fall when it rains is a medium amount not to much or to little. To much trouble went with a hard plastic option from Lowes."
1,A waste of your money!,"I purchased this raindrain to take the water away from my lanai and the foundation. It was simple to put on. Then it started to rain. I watched with anticipation as the rain got heavier. The drain unrolled as advertised. But the little sprinkling holes were inadequate for a heavy downpour. The rainwater then backed up into the downspout and started shooting out, with force, out of all the connections of the gutter. Needless to say it is a waste of money unless you have the ""perfect rainfall"" so it can unroll and roll back up without problems............I don't think we can predict that sort of thing. It has been removed and thrown out!"
2,Good for one season,"This thing worked as advertised. It unrolled and a cute little shower effect occured. It shot three or four feet in the air during a heavy rain. Alas, the next spring the plastic had cracked and it worked no more. Also, the capacity to drain water was insufficient during a downpour and my gutters over flowed over my porch and ran into my basement anyway."
2,not great,It really isn't long enough to push water away from the house because it has holes just a couple of feet from the down spout and that is where most of the water will leak out unless it is a heavy downpour.
1,Seams keep splitting,"I have had three of the rain drains, you would think I would learn after the second one. In the beginning they are just great, but 2 or 3 months later in the fall they start to split at the seams. We have not even had any cold nights yet as warned on the package."
4,Not bad,"Solid, ok plot, ok characters, which I hope develop more in later works. I agree fully with the other reviewer. The author writes solidly- short, to the point-, not really well like a PD James or other literary style writer, but it's ok for a procedural. The only odd thing about this book is that it seems to have been originally written in the 1980s -everyone is dressed in 1980's clothes, such as suits with vests, track suits, etc. Most people are still using cassettes, and the references to Hill Street Blues and other 1980's pop culture are only offset by occasional disconcerting references to 1990's music, culture and CDs. This does not really work. If it was originally set in the 1980's it probably should have been left there."
3,Editing is horrible,"In the Kindle edition the content is good; the editing is atrocious. There is no Deuteronomy 30:31 in my Bible, although that is a reference given. Words are missing, words are repeated, sentence structure is bewildering in some instances, and word usage is confusing. The content, while good, appears to be primarily paraphrases of other authors' books. It literally appears that this small book went from the author's hand to publication bypassing the editing step. It is simply not a very professional product. I find it difficult to believe this was a college textbook."
3,"Some good info, but reader beware","This book contains lots of interesting information and is worth a read if you work with abused children, or are the parent of a ""difficult"" child. However, the author sometimes ""edits"" what other people have written in a way that grossly distorts their meaning. For example, she may leave out key points, or re-write the other person's material (and she has done this even in direct quotes) so that it means something quite different from what the original author said. In other words, she edits/rewrites so that the material says what she wishes it to say. So if you find information that interests you in this book, I strongly recommend that you go back to the original source to check the accuracy of Gold's version. Don't rely on Gold to be accurate in reporting other people's research, experience, or opinions."
1,Nylon rope isn't better,"We bought this for our dog because it was supposed to be durable, stand up to chewing and last longer than regular rope toys. After one and a half weeks, our dog has the entire thing ripped apart and strewn about the house. This seems no better than any other rope toy for strength and durability. I could have gotten the same results for a lot less money."
3,The History of Flight from the beginning to the late '90s,"Although this book was published to accompany the BBC television series it stands alone as an excellent quality publication. An ideal Christmas or Birthday present for the teenager who is passionate about aviation and a good source of basic information on flight and the personalities,events and aircraft that have forged its history."
5,Just as good as the rest,"I noticed that the overall rating for this album is lower than the rest of their albums. Maybe it's me but this disk is just as good as any of Manticora's other disks. In fact the drumming by Mads Volf seems to be top notch here. I also noticed that even though the keyboards are by different guest musicians, they are very well done also. The songwriting is good and the rest of Manticora are in fine form here. Again maybe I am prejudiced here because I like these guy's so much but this is an excellent progressive/thrash/power metal album."
1,Carrots not for chinchillas,"Chinchillas should not eat carrots, vegetables or fruit. They need timothy hay and a low protein alfalfa pellet. This product will not be healthy, and will most likely shorten your chinchillas lifespan."
3,Works too well,"Exerts great pressure. Accidentally released it while setting up, thing jumped a couple feet in the air and broke in half. Grateful no fingers were involved. Would it cut a rodent in half? I bought a few, rat was killed. Not sure how the cost works out if the breakage is normal."
4,That Was One Dead Rat!,Easy to set.Easy to release dead rat.Could not have been deader. I will probably buy more of these.
4,Mouse trap,This product was very easy to use and was very effective...easy to set. The price was good and shipped quickly.
2,Really Zaps Rats Until it Breaks,"I ordered a six pack of these traps. We have 10 acres of open space behind us that's filled with assorted critters including literally 100's of pack rats. They come into the yard at nite and decimate the garden. I gave one trap to a neighbor and set the remaining 5 using peanut butter for bait. We caught rats in all six traps the first nite and had varying degrees of success for the next week. I was delighted. Then I discovered I was unable to set one of the traps because the plastic latch that holds the trap in the set position had worn smooth. Watch out fingers!! The same thing happened to two more traps leaving me with 3 working traps. They're a great idea, much easier and safer to set than the old wooden ones, and they catch rats. I would have given them 5 stars if they had been more reliable. At 5 bucks a pop they should last longer than a week."
4,"Effective, but not instant","I was surprised to find rat droppings in an unused room so I ordered this trap. It was easy to set. I would say it is big enough for a regular-sized rat but not for something with a head as large as a squirrel's. A few days later I heard the ruckus of the snap followed by clanging that was an apparent attempt to get free or just natural creepy dying convulsions. When I finally inspected the room hours later, I found the trap completely shut on a rat's neck. I promptly ordered more traps. I used peanut butter as recommended, which I suspect is because it can not be claimed as easily as a more solid morsel. Unknown is if that was the first time the rat returned to the room since setting the trap. I am not sure how the traps fare when being re-used, because I just threw the whole execution scene away without the desire to touch any of it."
5,So EASY Soap,"This book will get you going! If you've ever even thought about making soap this will make the actual start so much easier. I collected lots of information off the web - there are many helpful sites out there- but this book made it all fit together. We've (a few friends) made three large batches - all perfect! There's no stopping us now! This book is a great starting point. I know there are other books that deal more in depth with different types of soaps, but this book will get you started!"
2,Mildly Entertaining,"I purchased the book because the reviews sounded good. I was disappointed wish I would have checked it out from the library instead. I found it only mildly amusing and felt that it was not written very well. If you are looking for a good sailing book, read John Kretschmer's ""Flirting with Mermaids"" or Susan Tyler Hitchcock's ""Coming About"" instead."
1,The best first mod for your A5,A important lesson that you get what you pay forI installed this trigger and it worked great for a few weeks and then it started to skip shots and would not reengage the sear plate until it finally stopped working all together. I took the trigger assembly apart and tested the assembly to try to figure out why the trigger stopped working but I could not find anything wrong with it. I ended up replacing it with the original trigger and the A5 works again.This is what you get for buying a $4 dollar trigger.
1,doro sucks,"i bought this, took my gun apart, tried to install and i got mad because the hole was to small and even if u do make the hole bigger it does not fit well in the trigger holder thing so basically i have a double trigger frame with a single trigger :)"
5,Great,"I ordered this from Doro sports, it arrived via USPS very quick. The only draw back was no instructions and it only came in a clear plastic bag. Easy to put in if you are mechanically inclined, took about 5 mins when it was all said and done. There is a small mod that had to be done because one of the holes for the pins was too small, so I just grabbed a drill pit and ran it in a few times and presto! no more issues. I would caution you though, be careful you don't do it too much as the trigger could sit loose if the hole is too big. Cant beat it for the price. Also just because it says Tippmann doesn't mean its made by Tippmann."
4,Nice double trouble,"This is a must for woodsballers that do not want to go fully automatic. It provides a decent dual trigger and guard, installs easily, and looks pretty good too! I recommend getting the firing pin upgrades as well - it really cuts down on trigger pull!"
4,Good Double Trigger,"It works flawlessly,however theres a lil flaw that the guard doesnt aline correctly with gun but that doesnt bother me."
4,Microsoft Office Automation with Visual FoxPro,"The built-in vfp report writer, is with no question a powerful tool, but when it comes to end-user report customization, MS Excel is still the report writing tool of choice. This is a great book for those starting to get acquainted with office automation specially for those who wanted to make use MS Excel as the report writer via VFP. The accompanying ebook makes it a lot better..."
1,What was I think 2!!,"I also bought this over the summer after buying a Grizzly Band saw (BTW, I really enjoy the band saw) but after putting this thing together and putting a 1/2 "" flat hole bit to create a simple hole in a 1.5 "" thick oak, the bit would stop with the slightest pressure as if it can't do it. Come on, 1/2 amp can't even drill a simple hole? I then put a simple 1/4"" bit in and it too would stop with some added pressure. This thing has NO muscle!!! Granted, I didn't expect too much but this is rediculous. Even the drum sanding portion is about worthless. Can't sand anything with such little power."
1,"WEAK, DO NOT PURCHASE","The drill is not strong enough to drill through steel, it has to ramp up speed and quickly comes to a halt when in contact with metal.I doubt the 1/2 horsepower rating is correct, my cordless drill has more torque, now I'm stuck with this."
1,Worst sounding mix EVER!!!! AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!,This is a travesty to a fine band. A few songs that are so badly recorded my dog ran for cover. Save your money and do NOT buy this piece of dog doo!!!! 'Nuff said!!
1,Do Not Buy,"A collection of bad edits & bad mixes & fast fades. It also has the wrong song - the liner notes say it's Mighty Quinn from the ""Watch"" album but it's not - it's the original by Manfred Mann & not the Earth Band."
2,Cheap but nothing more,"As mentioned in the subject, the price is great but thats about it. Some reasons for me saying so - the CD cud have had at least 5-6 more songs, cud hv had a better selection (more popolar songs of MM). Also, I found shortened versions of couple of the better songs!"
1,NOT AS GOOD AS OLYMPUS OEM BATTERY,"I purchased 2 Targus LI42B batteries in 2007 to complement my OEM battery for my Stylus 740. I take LOTS of pictures at car racing events when I travel to the point where battery life becomes the weakest link. With all 3 batteries charged in the morning, I went through both Targus batteries in 2 hours (1 hour each...best case!). The ONE Olympus battery would last me over 4 hours. The same thing happened the next day. The 3rd day, I used the OEM Olympus battery first and I went easily into the afternoon and only needed to swap in one Targus at the very end of the day. Now, 2008 one year later, the Targus battery (I lost one) didn't last 1/2 hour. The OEM went 3+ hours and still showing charged in the green zone. I'm going to buy another battery, it'll be an Olympus OEM. Yeah, its pricey, but if it works like the battery that came with the camera, it'll be worth it. If YOU by this battery, I'd advise to make sure it's NOT your PRIMARY battery."
1,Spends more time in the charger than in the camera,"I bought this to replace a dying Olympus-brand battery. It seemed like a good price, however I'm only able to take a handful of pictures before the camera complains that the battery needs to be charged. It also doesnt retain a charge for a long time (few weeks) even if it's not actively being used.I bought a real Olympus replacement and I've been much happier with that."
1,BUY ORIGINAL,"I'm always looking to save by using generic, but you can't skimp on everything. Ex: Toilet paper and rechargeable batteries. The targus brand held about 1/4 of the Olympus brand. Well worth the money to buy brand name, you get what you pay for here. Don't know why I'm surprised, this has been the case for all my rechargeables."
1,Won't buy this again,"Bought this at the same time as the camera. The battery's totally dead after < 1 yr. The original Olympus battery still works fine. Definitely not buying it again. spend a little more to get the original, you get what you paid for!!!"
4,Exactly like original Olympus battery; recommended,"I decided to try this battery instead of purchasing an Olympus brand battery. They are only a fraction of the price, and I find them to work and perform exactly like the Olympus brand. I have purchased a total of four of these batteries. I would recommend them to anyone who does not wish to spend full price for the brand name battery."
2,Not a lot of juice,"Bought this battery instead of the Olympus to save a few bucks. Big mistake. Has half or less life than the Olympus. Have since bought the Olympus version and have the backup power I need. As my wife says, ""Don't be so cheap."" She was right on this one."
1,"Useful, But there are very much differents with the original Olympus products. It's body is covered by paper.",Targus Digital TGB-LI42B Rechargeable Digital Camera Battery (Equivalent to Olympus LI-42B)
1,Can't return if opened,If you purchase a product from this company and have opened it for use you may not return it under any condition. I bought an Olympus camera which broke after one week and can't return the accessories!
3,"A really, REALLY little book...","I didn't expect much from this book, but I have to admit I was surprised by just how little it really was. Fits nicely in the palm of your hand, conceivably so you could carry it around with you for reference when deciphering the obscure text messages your friends send your cell phone.It does a fair job of covering the usual abbreviations, shortcuts and acronyms, IMHO. The smileys are a bit of a stretch. I found it odd that standard ones appear multiple times with different descriptions. Felt like they were trying to fill the book.In short, it's a cute little book that might make a nice gift for someone just getting into instant or text messaging. Don't expect to use it as a serious reference, though."
3,Not Complete,"This book is OK, but is a short list of how many texts are really out there. nice size of the book."
5,All Americans should watch this!,"Unlike most liberal documentaries that mock Christianity, Pelosi really tries to get to know Christians in her roadtrip across America. This is a decent portrayal of red state America, including one of the last interviews with the legendary Jerry Falwell before his death."
3,"Good for What it Shows, But a Partial View of American Evangelicalism","What this documentary shows is definitely out there in the U.S., and this DVD shows it in an entertaining way. But to people who do not know any better, what Pelosi focuses on here is only part of the larger story, which is much more complex. American evangelicalism in fact includes huge sectors that are much more moderate, thoughtful, balanced, and internally complicated than what this DVD shows. So it is somewhat misleading about the bigger reality.I suggest that Pelosi do a documentary on Tim Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church in her own hometown, NYC. That would provide some needed balance and complexity.I also suggest anyone interested in this topic reading my book, Christian America?: What Evangelicals Really Want (California, 2002)."
2,Very underwhelming.,"This film plays like a college student's project. I really liked ""Jesus Camp"" and I also really like some of Alexandra's previous work so I thought this would be a good bet. Unfortunately not. Very poorly edited, poorly structured, unfocused, boring, and shallow. Did not offer any additional insights (negative or positive) on the ostensible subject(s). If you are interested in this subject then rent/buy ""Jesus Camp"" and if you are interested in a solid doc from Ms. Pelosi rent/buy ""Journey's With George."""
3,"Not bad but falls short of ""Journeys""","An interesting doc and worth a look, but it doesn't really deliver deliver the insights, or quirky charm that make ""Journeys with George"" so memorable. Moreover, Ms. Pelosi really fails to keep her bias in check this time around; one very unfortunate example is a bit of Michael Moore-style deceptive editing. A gay man silently weeps in church as the surrounding congregation sings ""God Bless America."" Very poignant, until you look closely and see that the singers are singing something else -- the vocals are dubbed. Watch with a grain of salt."
2,Light on the information,I got this video because I had heard there was going to be information about Rev. T Haggard. It didn't contain a lot of information about him.
4,Would you rather watch an oval race or something a little more exciting?,"I bought this to get a closer look at these ""Super Cars"" R34 GTR Z33 Mrk IV Supra Lambo's Ferrari Porche WRX STI's ect..., you get video from inside the cockpit and automotive specs, interviews with the japanese drivers, who talk about thier views on japanese vs. U.S. cars. As well as a couple of pretty good races. Nascar may go 200 and above miles an hour, but these are just more fun to watch, and they are still going 150+ mph. You have the GT300 (300hp) class racing at the same time as the GT500 (500hp)class. Which means the 500's have to be that much better. More intense in my opinion, a definate must have."
1,Disappointing,This book is very dated with mostly black & white photographs and some colour shots that show 60's interiors. It is a technical manual which is of little use in planning an interior in the 21st Century. I would not recommend this book as it is also poor quality paper and considerably overpriced.
5,Hauntingly beautiful music.,"This is a choice of different pieces by the author of music to such movies like ""Blue"", ""White"",""Red"", and ""Double life of Veronique"" by the Polish director Krzysztof Kieslowski. The music has been recorded in a historic salt mine in Poland, called Wieliczka, with wonderful acoustics, and with accompanying choirs and soloists. The music is hauntingly beautiful. This CD covers not only film music by Preisner, but also some of his classical compositions.If you liked the music in Kieslowski's films, try that CD!"
5,A New and Important Information about the Old West,"With biographical essays by Michael Patrick, lyrics and music by Cecil Williams, illustrations by Keith Conaway, ""The Black West in Story and Song"" provides a new and important information relating to an aspect of American history long neglected in a format that will charm, inform, and intrigue readers. Text, image, and song combine to provide the life stories of black explorers, outlaws, and lawmen; cavalrymen, foot soldiers, and scouts; cowboys, ranchers, and riders; as well as town founders, townspeople, and homesteaders. Michael Patrick's well researched text; Cecil Williams' perceptive interpretation of the livers of Black adventurers, explorers, and settlers in song, and Keith Conaway's forceful images are an important contribution to an understanding of the settlement of the West."
4,Extremely Pleased with this Ballhead,"I set out to purchase the best ballhead for my needs and I instantly assumed that I had to spend upwards of a hundred dollars. After doing some reading online, I realized that I was wrong. This ballhead is a perfect fit to my Velbon El Carmagne tripod. It came with the additional threaded screw for whatever tripod you own. It even came with a tool for securing the screw in place, properly.I have a Nikon D40 and 18-135 lens and it is extremely sturdy in my tripod. It should be able to handle any mid size DSLR and any Consumer Lens or wide angle lens that you happen to have on your camera.The only thing that I wish it had was a built in level but for the money, it was well worth it. I can always purchase a level for my hotshoe but I doubt that I will even use it... Enjoy!"
1,Don't buy this or any other watches from Nike .. there's no after sales support,"WARNING ... i own a Nike Triax C6 watch and guess what Nike told me when i tried to get it fixed... ""Sorry we've stopped manufacturing spare parts for Nike Watches"" ..."
5,A Revolutionary Resource!,"As someone who juggles many different responsibilities and a crowded calendar, I approached this title with high expectations. I was not disappointed! Covey here offers a revolutionary resource for time management. Rather than following the standard theme of how to do more in a given period of time, the author emphasizes the importance of setting priorities and planning ahead. His analogy of the clock and the compass is priceless in describing the two elements that should both be balanced in our prioritizing and scheduling.I've been exposed to many varied techniques of time management, but have not experienced anything as revolutionary and life-transforming as this title. For anyone who can't find enough time to ""get everything done that needs to be done,"" I highly recommend this book. It's been a huge help to me!"
2,Less than enthralling,"I was dismayed to find that this audio book is simply a laundry listing (in an ""advice o'the day"" format) of tidbits of wisdom. The wisdom offered is good, mind you, but if you are looking for something to stimulate and entertain you (eg on a long car ride) you will likely be disappointed. I can only listen to about 4 or 5 tidbits before I lose interest."
4,A great simple framework,"The book provides a great framework for being productive - focusing on the important over the urgent. It covers the dangers of spending too much time on things that others deem mandatory, sacrificing what is truly valuable.Two dissenting thoughts on the book. The first is the obvious - ""If only it were so easy..."" Of course if it were easy, there would be no need for the book. The second is that the key concepts could be delivered in a much shorter format. But that's a small complaint - how expensive is a $12 paperback? It pays for itself with even a small improvement in personal productivity."
4,Good Book,"I bought this book because I needed some guidance to start putting things back in order in my life. Eventhough it focus on business and work, it provides some helpful hints to apply on you personal life."
5,Put first things first - it's a matter of priorities.,"This book makes a great companion to Covey's highly acclaimed ""7 Habits"", unquestionably, one of the very best self devlopment books of all time.First Things First may be getting a bad rap by some negative reviewers because it sounds too simple. Some folks like to check out all sorts of fancy charts with million dollar words so they can impress people at parties on how smart thay think they are.Simple and to the point. First Things First. Read it along with 7 Habits and ignore the 1 star reviewers."
5,Living life from what you value,"As a business coach ,I am always looking for good time management books to recommend. I have read at least a dozen since I read this the first time eight years ago. The focus on quality of life and distinguishing the difference between what is important and what is not has made a dramatic shift in how I prioritize my day.Even though the ""stuff"" often gets left undone,I am satisfied because I did the things that give my life value and meaning for me.In addition, I can now catch myself running on adrenaline or attempting to do it all and change my behavior. It just doesn't get any better than that! Alicia Fruin"
4,Just What the Doctor Ordered,"First Things First is just what the doctor ordered. It most definitely has something to offer. It answers questions, it shows why, and it explains how-to. It held my attention thoughout. I was surprised as I began reading that this book would be used as a textbook (especially for a business writing class). But the author makes it clear that these foundational principles are what gives any life its quality, rich substance and character no matter who you are, where you are or what you have chosen to do in life. And unles you build from here up, your structure is built in vain. In addition to its clarity, the book contains diagram explanations and illustrations that assist with comprehension, which makes for smooth reading. The author's collective knowledge and life-experiences have produced an excellent work that I highly recommend."
4,"Excellent book, but lots of marketing type material","I find this book well written. It has a clear way of making us thinking of putting the more important things first in our life. In particular, I remember the example of putting the big rocks in the jar first and packing the rest of the material (sand, smaller rocks) around them. It was a nice analogy.As for the cons, I think this book in particular has a lot of material that really doesnot have to be the way it is given. For example, ""Win-Win"", ""Synergistic thinking"", ""Circle of influence"", ""Shared vision"" etc etc etc., I like such phrases because they help me remember the points mentioned, but the book is so full of them I got a little put off. I mean, a phrase like this on every second page!Overall, a recommended buy for everyone. From students to CEO s."
4,great getting it together tool,"I purchased this book as a Christmas gift for someone special who told me since reading the book he has been able to adapt a positive change in his busy and hetic life in a very positive way. He has been able to put in priority and balance the pressures, responsibilities, expetations of both his personal and business life,"
4,For the individual always on the run,"This is a great book to read for those of us who juggle life. It talks about how to prioritize and how to over come Urgency Addition. If there was one book to make the time to read, it should be this one."
5,Get to know the quadrants,"This book uses four quadrants to show where daily activities that are routine and unimportant and consume lots of time lie. It's helpful and gives a fresh approach to a new scheduling technique. The minute by minute booking system may just be a list of things that have to be done in a single day. This book helps you make time for the NOT urgent but important things that are Quadrant II, where long term success lye."
4,Just What the Doctor Ordered,"First Things First is just what the doctor ordered. It most definitely has something to offer the reader. An excellent how-to book, First Things First held my attention throughout. I was surprised as I began reading that this book would be used as a textbook (especially for a business writing class). But the authors makes it clear that these foundational principles are what gives any life its quality, rich substance and character no matter who you are, where you are or what you have chosen to do in life. And unless you build from here up, your structure is built in vain. In addition to its clarity, the book contains diagram explanations and illustrations that assist with comprehension, which makes for smooth reading. The authors' collective knowledge and life-experiences have produced an excellent work that I highly recommend."
2,Low Quality,"This pedal car is very poorly constructed. Obviously, the manufacturer chooses to be the low price leader; sacrificing quality appears to be acceptable."
3,picture does not match what they shipped me,"This was suppose to be blueberry filled breakfast bars, what I received instead was multigrain rice crispy bars with very few blueberries. They are made by the same great company and are made with healthy ingredients but that is not what the picture shows and not what I wanted. You can not return food items so I gave them to my neighbors kids and they love them. I need to figure out how to let Amazon know they are shipping the wrong item so it does not happen to someone else!"
3,Sediment Monitoring Data for the San Simon Valley,"This document id available from the USDI BLM in Safford, AZ and from the University of Arizona Library.Kelly AltenhofenOffice of Arid Lands Studiesthe University of Arizona"
1,Not enough info,"There is no text description, and it's impossible to tell from the picture how many pieces are in the package."
5,ALIAS Season 1 : Wow what can I say!,"Alias has possibly got to be the finest TV show ever. Not only is it superbly written and directed but the acting is pure quality. It is truly a pleasure to watch.Having watched the first season I just had to watch it again on DVD. Once you start watching it you just can't stop. Unfortunately, I am unable to view the second season due to it being aired on a channel in the UK which isn't available to everyone (Channel 5). However, having just seen that ALIAS 2 is out on DVD in December has just cheered me up.Just have to say - the cast are fantastic.Anybody not familiar with the series - trust me you'll love it!"
3,"Solid Spy Fun, Now with a Tad More Emotion","3 1/2 Stars. This was a fun, bubble-gum pop kind of a show in its day. I was a fan when it first aired, largely because it featured some engaging performances by the principles and because the producers were able to create some fun (albeit it often wholly preposterous) storylines on a limited TV budget. Garner, Garber, Olin and Rifkin are especially good, although the talents of Carl Lumbly, Bradley Cooper, and Kevin Weisman should not be overlooked. Season 2 adds some solid emotional drama to the mix, as a person from Sydney's past returns. Good, fun entertainment, although the first two seasons are really the only two worth investing in. After Season 2, the plots get a little too stale or a little too convoluted. But if you're looking for two solid seasons of entertainment and can afford to skip the rest, this is a solid bet."
5,LOVE IT!!!,"I rented all 5 seasons and watched them as fast as I could I loved them that much! THEN, I purchased all 5 seasons cuz they were that good!!! This is the only TV series I have ever purchased...again, cuz they were THAT GOOD!!!"
3,Another mostly great season of TV,"Back for it's second season Alias continues on with the great writing and mostly good plots(it's still somewhat comic book but a lot of fun). Sydney has now found that her mother is still alive and wanting to switch sides (her ex- husband Jack Bristow seems to almost pathologically hate her). That's one of the better subplots this season with quite a few twists and turns (you never know what's coming up next)Later in the season SD-6 is finally shut down (all in one episode, which I missed the first time around, which was really confusing to me). The season had a lot of odd turns (3rd season looks like it will really start out strangely)and several interesting guest appearances by actors/ actresses I didn't expect to see on TV including Rutger Hauer, Faye Dunaway and Christian Slater."
4,good series,I've been watching Alias since the beginning and it is one of the better shows on TV and probably the only one I really try to catch. First season DVDs were great.But if you want to see the awesome series that Alias obvious emulates you should check out La Femme Nikita Season 1. It is an amazing series and honestly far better than Alias.
3,At least as worthwhile to watch as Season 1,"One of my biggest complaints with this show is that it is a bit drawn out, but that is par for the course for Abrams series'. His shows are all about character development and that at least is done pretty well I think. I like Jennifer Garner a lot of the time, but she's not always a very convincing actor in this role. To me this show is a decent way to kill time on winter weekday nights after work, but I find I often browse the web while watching. I would be extremely annoyed if I had to watch it on its original schedule, but being able to watch it here back-to-back makes it worthwhile."
4,Alias Season 2,"2nd season definitely better than the 1st season. That said, we have enjoyed both seasons and they are improving with each season. On to season 3....."
5,Great Buy,Got my Season set of DVDs new in box at a fairly fast speed. I would definately buy from this seller again. Thanks.
4,Alias Squared - Or Spy Family Saves the Day,"Takes every great from season 1 and doubles it by adding mother, in this case the incomparable, Lena Olin. It's the most entertaining dysfunctional spy family yet. Again Jennifer Garner, Victor Garber (give the man an Emmy already...) and Ron Rifkin shine. The main Rimbaldi puzzle gets deeper and the season ends with a shocking twist. Spies, double/triple dealing, explosions, a dysfunctional family that can kick butt, great locations, and mystery...what more could you ask for?"
2,Surprised,Started watching Season 2 and when I got to the end it was missing the last CD so I as not able to see the last two episodes. I was disappointed that I did not catch it when I first got the DVD.
3,I HATE autostart previews on the first disk.,"Although I love the series I will probably not buy the 3rd season. I don't mind the promos being there - but the autostart irritates me to the point where I don't want to buy their dvd's (and yes, I know I just have to is wait and push 'menu' button) I'm buying the dvd - I don't want to have to avoid advertisements!"
3,No Combined Shipping,"I was satisfied with the product, but UNsatisfied with the seller. I bought two different things from him on the same day, with the same transaction, hoping they would see the connection and combine my shipping. But instead I got charged twice and got sent two different pacakges. I wish that they had better customer service and made things easier for the both of us."
4,Good online buying experience,"The case for the DVD set was more worn than I expected, but other than that everything was great. I got it on-time and have no problems with the DVD's so far. If this seller had another product that I wanted at a good price I would buy from them again."
5,F. W. Woolworth's grand-daughter's search for happiness,"This is an awesome tail of the granddaughter of F.W. Woolworth, Barbara Hutton who, after her mother dies, inherits one of the largest fortunes ever amassed making her one of the richest women in the world. As the story unfolds the viewer understands that this &#65533;poor little rich girl&#65533; feels perfectly alone and attempts to buy her way out of isolation as well as drink and drug herself to numb the pain of having everything she never wanted and nothing she ever needed. In the course of her search for emotional fulfillment she marries husband after husband including two different princes who abuse her and a marriage to the famed actor Cary Grant, Barbara Hutton is embezzled from and taken advantage of in every conceivable way. This movie is awesomely shot and directed. Farah Fawcett is tremendous in her portrayal and the score is beautiful.Mark Matthews"
1,Where's the rest of it?!,"I hadn't seen this movie since it was first shown on TV in the 80s and naturally expected the video to show the entire mini-series as it originally aired. I was very disappointed and irritated (and felt cheated) that the video version has been shortened/condensed and I don't understand why it was done this way! When other miniseries are released on video or dvd, they are presented in their entirety, so why wasn't this one?! If I had known in advance that the video was abridged, I never would have purchased it. Buyer Beware..."
3,I agree,I also ordered the video and realized that it was not the entire movie. It makes the movie seem very choppy and hard to follow without these parts. I do not understand why it was done this way and would love to find an original copy.
3,"Classic Upfield, but not his best.","This is a classic Upfield mystery, although Upfield's not at his best here. Bonarparte is sent to a bustling mining town, but doesn't do much of his usual bushman's work. Upfield portrays the life in this town well, but the murderer's motive is pretty weak this time."
1,WARNING: DO NOT USE THESE SCREENS!,"I installed these last season and found that all of my gutters have turned into ponds this season. The screens collect leaves and eventually act like a dam, holding the water and decomposing plant material in the gutter. I took all of these screens out and had to spend a few hours flushing out my gutters this weekend. Lesson learned. Do not use these."
5,Mouse Guard--Worked to keep mice out of PVC pipe!,"My furnace vents out onto my deck. Although the PVC pipes have bird guards, mice could get through those little holes. I searched for something that might work and these were perfect when I tried them! They expanded to fit with no tools, just stick them in! I don't think mice could get through these, but the air comes through without hindrance. I know they're not sold as mouse guards, but if you have a situation similar to mine, try these."
4,one of my favorite movies,"awesome movie, came fast and exactly what I wanted. the only bad thing was that the plastic case on the box was ripped. other than that it was a great purchase at a great price. I just switched the box from an old dvd."
3,Dinah East,Only problem is that the original source seems to be video. I was hoping for a restored transfer from film but I suppose as it is a rare film that was the best source available.
2,Dinah East,"This DVD brought back memories of the 70's. Seeing this movie, originally, at the theatre was quite interesting. Now, as I look at it as a pioneer of Alternative Lifestyle film containing frontal nudity. The story line is quite weak, by today's standards and I would consider it only fair. Bob Cinema Critic"
3,How to be a 40+ Fit Man,"It is a fitness book to meet the needs of men in their mid-30s and beyond. The exercises in the book are good except that most requires you to be at a gym as it requires equipment - unlike Jorge Cruise's ""Eight Minutes in the Morning"".The nutrition and the suggestions on how to look young are also instructive."
2,Decent book; item not as described,The book would probably be better for older children - my 2 1/2 year old was bored two pages into it. Item did not include cd as described by seller; unfortunately I didn't notice that until after the return deadline.
1,Should not be in the children's section,"I borrowed this book from the library b/c my children liked the pictures. When I sat down to read it to them I was appauled by the language and negative attitudes in the book. Words and phrases like, ""shut up and give me the candy,"" and ""idiot."" If you want a child who enjoys the innocent thrills of Halloween this is not the book for you; but if you want a disrespectful and ungrateful child trick or treating then...actually I wouldn't reccommend this book to anyone!"
1,Zero Stars Would Be More Appropriate,"This would never have been published were it not for the Seinfeld name. This is not a book, but rather a transcription of a not-very-funny standup routine. Avoid this ""book."""
2,Halloween,"Though this book is artistically beautiful, the concept is not for children. I sat down to read it to my grandson last night, the night before he was to go out to ""get his candy"" and I was shocked. My mistake, I had just gotten the book in the mail and had failed to read it before I sat him down. This is not a book for children. I will not teach my grandson that if he does not get what he wants he can throw it back, or that he can talk in such a rude manner. Because of this I had to skip pages...."
3,"candy, candy, candy...","After the Letters From a Nut books, I have come to expect a lot from Jerry Seinfeld the author. The first question to be answered is: ""can a format like the one used in his new Halloween book deliver as many laughs as the Nut books?"" The obvious answer is no. It is too short. That said, Halloween is still mighty funny.This book is not for younger kids. They might laugh at some of the goofier illustrations, but the humor is more teenaged than child-oriented (unless your kids are already jaded at an extremely young age).Seinfeld draws most of the comedy in Halloween from the yearly quest for candy. No ghosts or ghouls haunt the pages of this book--unless you count sugar addiction and greed. Three words sum up the book quite nicely: candy, candy, candy.All in all, Halloween is a fun and entertaining book. A classic? Probably not."
1,Even my kids knew it was inappropriate,"Why is it that anyone famous in Hollywood thinks they can write a kids' book? Not only is the language low-class (fools, stupid, shut up, etc.), Seinfeld tries to use adult humor and bad grammar to entertain children, resulting in a poorly written piece of junk. The plot is about getting the perfect costume and getting candy above all, but in a rude and disrespectful manner. The story does not even flow well because of the occasional unrelated sidebars. The end states ""I realized when you're a kid you don't need a costume, you ARE superman."" That was right after the kid woke up from eating the entire bowl of candy in one night. It is like Seinfeld felt the need to have SOME kind of a positive message in the book -- maybe he could have tried by writing a better book, or by not writing one at all."
5,Great for kids,"Halloween is Seinfeld at his funniest. Based on one of his comedic momologues, this illustrated childrens book is the story of one child's view of Halloween. Of course, that child being Jerry Seinfeld, the vision is a little twisted...it's all about the candy! No matter what he has to wear, or who he has to talk to, this kid (like most) wanted candy.Riffing on [crummy]... storebought costumes, the mandatory winter coat and the disapppointment of receiving those strange little marshmallow peanuts, Seinfeld recreates what Halloween was like for all of us as children. Also, complimenting the hilarious text is the beautiful illustrations by James Bennett, Halloween is the ideal book for kids who are gearing up for the 31st or for adults who know and love Jerry Seinfeld's sardonic and true-to-life style of humour.A 5-star book for sure."
2,Well....,"I'm surprised by the other reviews.I actually read the entire thing in a book store, so I couldn't say if I was dissapointed that I had purchased it. But, putting myself in the situation, I'd say I would be.I'm a HUGE Seinfeld fan, but this book was just NOT funny. It also reused a number of jokes I heard from Jerry before."
3,Sorry Jerry.,"All three of those stars are for the incredibly beautiful illustrations by James Bennett. (who actually deserves 5 plus stars for this work.) This story (if you wanna call it that) is culled from one of Jerry's routines. The way it reads makes it seem like there wasn't an editor on this book. It's almost as if they transcribed it from a tape. Jerry, you are a great comedian and I loved,...still love your TV show but, come on now. There are plenty of good authors just waiting for this kind of chance,...even some with terrific comedic sense.I really don't know why this is a book. It looks great and will most likely sell very well. As far as the story goes,...it doesn't say anything to the reader. It just repeats over and over, how great candy is, where can I get some and how great candy is again. This book has only one note.However, Kudos to James Bennett, who DOES deliver the goods.Sorry Jerry."
2,Eehhhh.............,"Eehhhhhhh......not so much for kids. It is quite a funny take from an adult's perspective, but doesn't have a good flow for a children's book. I don't think that smaller kids would actually get the jokes, as he is describing situations that occur when you are older and still desire the CANDY! experience. The book just doesn't have a good ""flow"" for the K and above range, though kids hitting 10-ish will relate. As the format is a picture book, I just see big gaps in content and style for it's designated audience. As a kid's librarian, I see adults giggling over the book, but not much interest for the little guys. I agree with the other disappointed reviewer, and am a little suprised by the professional review magazines. I think they were a little swayed by the Sienfeld name."
4,Funny book!,"This book is hilarious! The illustrations are amazing and make the jokes even funnier. I believe the CD helps to deliver the lines better, just reading the book without the CD isn't as funny. Unfortunately, I'm not sure if the jokes are geared towards children. The illustrations may be amusing to them, but the jokes seem to be more for an older audience to enjoy. Doesn't matter....I thoroughly enjoyed it anyway! Definately a must have for Seinfeld fans."
1,I Met This Guy 30+ Years Ago . . . .,"I met Ken Wooden in the late 70's and put together a speaking gig for him at my university. At the time, I volunteered at a halfway house for troubled teens and intended to pursue an MSW and work in that field. To promote Wooden and his book, ""Weeping in the Playtime of Others,"" we did the typical wheat paste posters and booked an auditorium for his speech. The turnout was good. Much to my shock, the guy tried to hit on one of my friends, a female student who was all of 21 years old, and propositioned her for sex. I realized then that the guy was a fraud and liar, who was a total hypocrite about what he was preaching. I went on to get a law degree and left the field. I hope that people can see this scumbag for what he truly is."
1,only good for direct one source lighting,"Only good for one source direct lighting... You cannot use this with any reasonable results with more than one light source... This is a very nice product if you can 1.) walk and stand where your subject is and then face the light source and then take the image and then set your white balance to use that last image.This you can imagine will be a pain but this is how the instructions state it to be used and not how others have posted videos of it's use.I find it to be much easier to use a grey card or just set my white balance right there.Please, write me if you have any issues setting your white balance and I will tell you are very easy trick for that.Wish everyone great white balance,kai"
5,Wonderful White Balance Tool,I'm so happy with my ExpoDisc. Even though I mostly shoot portraits I feel like it's a little warm for me but it's really easy to batch fix each time I use. So easy to use!
3,Coffee filter works almost as well,I bought both the WB and the WB warm. They can produce unexpected results. Frankly I think a coffee filter works almost as well.
3,Not as educating as I expected,I bought this book as a textbook but did not like it. He tries to oversimplify history and situations and gives more information about the locations rather than how these areas are different than our western society.
2,shows lack of understanding of the Christian Faith---,"Christians receive their salvation through Jesus Christ, not fasting as stated in the book. This is a major mistake about the fundamentals of Christianity."
3,Time Traveler's Wife,"I thought this film would be better than it was. I like the actors, but was not impressed with the movie."
4,Great movie!,"I enjoyed this movie very much. The chemistry between the two lead characters is great. Yes, some of the scifi elements are a bit stretched, but this movie is more labeled as a romance. I'm planning to buy the blu ray soom from Amazon, but can anyone tell me if the original ending of Henry visiting Claire as an old woman made it to the extras? Can't seem to find this info anywhere."
3,Movie is never as good as the book...,"It's not as good as the book. But Rachel McAdams does romantic movies well. A little hard to follow if you've never read the book I imagine, and even then that was slightly confusing. Eric Bana doesn't do it for me though either..."
5,i love this movie,This is a wonderful thought provoking movie. I have seen it before but wanted to be able to watch it again
2,One star per cheek,"Worth a look for Rachel McAdams' fetching rear end, which we get to glimpse at in two or three flattering outfits as well as naked. The girl's got a nice bottom!"
5,Most loved!,"Absolutely beautiful movie, most worth the bluray upgrade! Makes you want to go get the book right away, hope you enjoy as much as I did! ;)"
3,It's just okay.,"Some parts of this movie just didn't make any since. QUESTION:If you time travel and you've known your wife since she was a little girl, how come you don't recognize her at a certain point in the film???? (THIS LITTLE PIECE OF INFO GIVES NOTHING AWAY, BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING TO GIVE AWAY:TRUST ME). There were some parts of the film, I thought were touching, and other parts I thought were a little dry. It took me two days to watch the film and it's only 1hr and 40min long (approximately). The film had potential, if it wasn't for the inconsistancies of the story. THE NOTEBOOK is still the best romantic, movie of our time! I will take the time out and read the book."
3,Not impressed,"The only reason I even give this 3 stars is that I watched the whole thing.The acting in this movie was excellent. Eric Bana and Rachel McAdams are wonderful, as are the rest of the actors. However the story, which was a book that I was interested in reading, turns out to be a complete waste of time. And I can now scratch the book off my list of books to read. To call it a romance is such a joke. It's more of a frustration. It's one of those stories where the last 10-15 minutes seemed like a rush to get to the end... I wouldn't recommend this."
5,wow! what a great movie!,This is my wife and I's favorite movie right now. Our favorite movie together (romantic) other than this is the notebook for sure. This is probably better I would say. the story is better and the acting is better. But definitely a good movie fro anyone who though the notebook was a good movie and enjoyed it.
2,Was it the acting?,I just never bought into these characters on screen. I felt they had no chemistry at all and the acting was so disconnected. I didn't even cry when Henry died - I was just so unmoved through the entire movie. Maybe it was the acting - I don't know. I just wish I had never watched it.
1,very dissapointing,"this book was so good. when i saw rachel mcadams was going to be in it i couldn't wait to see it. i love her. well, unfortunately this movie was quiet bad. the acting by the main male role was awful. i have no clue why it has 4 stars on here."
3,The book is so much better,"As is always the case with time travel books, this movie did not go into detail. The book explains the story so much better, I do believe if I had not read the book first I would have been totally lost trying to watch this movie. The actors did a good job, and I enjoyed the movie I just think having read the book first I felt cheated that they didn't put more of the book into the film. This love story takes place over several years and our main male lead because of a genetic defect can time travel. He meets his wife to be early on, and the story goes into their life together and how they deal with his time travel. Enjoy the movie but then go read the book."
1,I saw the theatrical release...,and felt I wasted my movie on a cliche- ridden mediocre movie. Take your movie and buy something REALLY romantic. This will leave you cold.
1,WHAT ???????????????????????????????????,"i hope the book was better, I could imagine so.the imagery was nice and picturesque... however, the disconnection really failed to tell a moving or gripping story.the dialogue was so stale and laughable...it failed to justify either the romance or the element of sci-fi.it was just a hot mess."
1,Uh..Seriously not worth it.,Really not a romantic movie as the guy dies in the end. It is really a drama with a really worthless story line. I wouldn't recommend watching it.
1,have not received as of 2/22,I have not as yet received this product....had communication that the sellers child had been sick and the dvd was returned to her with the incorrect address. I supplied the correct address and am waiting to get the dvd.....
5,Great Love Story,"""The Time Traveler's Wife"" and ""The Notebook"" are two greatest SAD love story movies ever made.Must watch!"
1,"Slow, boring and just plain horrible!!",I only wish I could rate it at zero!! What a piece of junk and waste of my time and money!! I can't understand anyone rating it over a 1 star! Don't waste your time or money on this movie unless you want to be bored to death and bang your head against the wall when it ends! Garbage!
2,Time Traveler Fashion Show,"An okay movie, but nothing really deep or emotional ever happened. The timer traveler's child acted pretty smug about being able to control her time traveling. Why can't you change past or future events? Most of the movie was the main character jumping from time period to time period and hunting for clothing. The movie should have been called ""The Time Traveler's Fashion Party."" Perhaps the book is more in-depth and emotional, but the movie falls short in my opinion."
2,Average,"I guess I am surprised by good reviews but I am always at odds with general population.Let's just say I expected something a bit interesting. The gist of the story is that main character has a genetic defect that allows him to travel in time(kind of like magic, I guess). The entire movie consists of him going and coming back from his travels. It never explained how or why he is able to do that. Poor girl that he falls in love with spends her time waiting for him to come back from his ""travel"" and then they get a daughter who is ..whoops, a ""time traveler"" also. That's the whole movie for you. I love Sci-fi but this is a pretty poor attempt(and a boring one at that). There is a love story in there but frankly I couldn't have cared less. I found all the characters rather annoying and superficial. I think if you like movies that don't explain anything and don't go anywhere, this one is for you. Otherwise, I suggest a pass."
4,have not seen film yet,I re-read the book many times and obviously am enthralled with it. I trust the film to be as well done. I know that there are some elements that can't appear on film due to time constraints and subplots that would only tangle the very big story as it is. One thing I have been thinking of since I have read and re-read is that this almost seems to be a metaphor for the life of many couples-absence from some aspects of a relationship-where women may be present and the man is out of phase-the longing the woman fells to have her man get a clue. Please comment if you will.
5,5 Stars for Time Traveler's Wife,"I very much enjoyed the DVD of the ""Time Traveler's Wife."" It is a very original love story. With the man time jumping without any control could be humorous, frustrating, or very touching. The fact that it is not always chronological can make it confusing at first. I thought the acting was first class. If you like something very different, and at the same time stimulating a variety of emotions, this is a wonderful movie for you."
3,"Book, 10! Movie,5...","I bought this movie after having read the book. As is so often the case, the movie is a shadow of the book. At least half of the things that happened in the book do not even make it into the movie. I can think of at least 4 characters from the book that never made it into the movie. The ending was changed radically from the book, and the importance of Henry's running was not at all addressed in the movie, thus not letting the viewer understand the significance of a later event(don't want to give away the event, if you haven't seen/read the story). All in all, a so-so movie, not bad on it's own but somewhat disappointing if you have read the book, which I wholeheartedly recommend. Not really a science fiction story, but rather a very unique and powerfully moving love story."
4,The Time Travelers Wife,Enjoy the story!! Time Travelers Wife is an exciting look at life at different times in the lives of two characters.
5,Chick Flick Meets Sci-Fi,"The easiest, most helpful way to describe ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" is to call it a Sci-Fi Chick Flick. Here's why:Sci-Fi:Involves time travelDelves into the psychological, scientific, and familial issues related to time travelChick Flick:It's primarily about a romanceIt's slightly cheesyIf you're okay with all those traits, I'd highly suggest it. Yes, it's a little cheesy at times, but because of the depth of the issues it deals with it ends up being a worthwhile watch."
2,"You can rum, but you can't hide!","I'm not trying to ruin the movie, but the moral of the story is annoyingly repeated; even if you can see the future, you won't be able to do anything to change it. With a good actress like Rachel McAdams it was easy to allow this topic to pass, a drink might even help, but the annoying cheesiness was difficult for me. The other facts you should know about time travelers are: they are romantic, have money to buy a wedding ring even though they can't keep a job, and most importantly; they lose their clothes when they move in time so they have to stay in shape!You can swallow large doses of anti reality drugs but still can't miss the lameness and emptiness of this movie's pointless need to create some romance, what a waste of time!"
1,Boring.... Hoped it would be better,"I thought it was very boring and at times a little hard to follow. There's no excitement and definitely no real romantic feel to it. I hear the book is so much better so I am definitely going to read it. It's just one of those things where you have to see it for yourself, everyone will have a different opinion."
4,Time Travelers Wife,"I watched other time traveler movies, but found this one refreshing. Can not imagine the love that they shared considering the events that surrouded them."
4,interesting movie,a Movie i enjoyed watching with my husband. Kept you wondering and thinking. i recomend watching this one and am sure we will make sure our daughters borrow and watch it :) was quick to be delivered TY
3,Sometimes confusing,We found ourselves having to figure out what time period the main character was in several times through out the movie.
3,"High hopes, great actors, but missing too much.","If you read the book, and want one more fix of Henry and Clare, this movie will satisfy that. I know I hate it when a book ends and I have to say goodbye to my favorite characters. The actors were great.. and Eric Bana made me fall even more in love with the character of Henry. However, there was just too much missing from the book to make the movie succeed. My husband watched it with me and looked like he was in pain until the ending credits started rolling. Without having any knowledge of the book, it seemed like just a sappy romance with a little bit of science fiction thrown in. There were some really important pieces of the story that gave the characters their depth, and those were omitted from the movie."
3,good,"Good movie, not as good as the book and even left out a main character but hey, the movie is never as good as the book now is it?"
2,Just not a great movie,"Suprisingly boring movie. They did not succeed in getting the audience to connect with the characters. One somewhat unforseen ""twist"" isn't enough."
1,boring,"this movie was so slow and boring i fell asleep and didn't care that i missed parts of it,don't waste your time.it was just plain dumb."
1,Very disappointing!,"We saw this on an American Airlines flight last December. The premise was intriguing, but their were so many incongruencies and continuity errors, that the film was rather trying and rather unenjoyable."
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"THE MOVIE SEEMED VERY THROWN TOGETHER. IF YOUR LOOKING FOR ANOTHER STORY LIKE THE NOTEBOOK, ITS NOT THIS ONE."
1,Horrible,"The book was one of the best books I've ever read. This movie was so disappointing, didn't even come close to the book."
1,Just plain bad,I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. When I heard it was from the creators of the notebook I though it had to be good.... boy was I disappointed. This was probably one of the most boring films I have ever seen. I would not even waste your time watching this movie.
1,"Small, dry, brittle cookies...not at all similar to home made, similar to Andy's vending machine cookies.","Small, dry, brittle cookies...not at all similar to home made.These are similar to Andy's vending machine cookies, except they fall apart easier and very grainy.There are 3 little clear celophane packets inside.Not a taste treat, very mundane."
3,Not what I was hoping for.,"If you're looking for a big, firm, contoured pillow, this is not it. It wide, but very narrow and thin, even on the thick side. It almost feels like your head sinks right down to the mattress. However, I will say that my chronic neck pain has been slightly reduced since using this pillow but only if I lay on my back for the better part of the night, which I don't typically do. In about a year I full expect this pillow to be worn out. I don't understand why someone can't develop a large, firm, memory foam pillow that's contoured for back sleepers AND supportive for side sleepers."
2,"tedious,boring and lots and lots of reiterating","I expected a lot more detailed stories,but got so bored after several chapters.Sadly ,this is one book I raced through ,skipped & skipped ,hoping for juicier things to come.Alas it never happened and I gave up.One of the few books I deleted without going to the end."
2,Eh. It was okay. A bit too dramatic and emotional.,"Not the best. This lady is pretty typical of female prosecutors (I was a prosecutor, I know) in that she absorbs everything emotionally and believes that every person who walks into the courtroom as a defendant should be exterminated immediately lest they breed. Seriously, I was worn out just reading about her day. The amount of baggage she carried around during her time spent as an ADA was just incredible.Anyway, if you want to prosecute then this might be an interesting read. It does go into some of the standard operating procedures of many decent sized offices. However, let me assure you that there is much more humor in this job than this lady experienced. Sure, we all take our jobs seriously - but the old adage about laughing and not crying applies to law enforcement work in general. This lady was just not cut out for the work. I'd guess her workmates were happy to see her go."
5,A Non-Stop Adventure!,"Ms. Straus had quite an adventure at the Bronx DA's office and I'm glad that she shared it with us! Her work there was non-stop episodes of Law and Order, CSI and The Sheild all rolled up into one. It's hard to believe that one person could really experience all the types of cases that she did and that it's not fiction! Straus knows how to tell a story. She gave enough information that her cases were easy to follow, but the book is a very fast an interesting read. There was not a moment in the book that I found to be slow. What I liked most about the book was that, in spite of all of the horror that she experienced, the author still had a positive message to send. You'd think that after what she saw, her view of the world would be much less optimistic...mine might be just reading about her cases. But it's not a negative book. Rather, Ms. Straus really seems to have left the DA's office with her faith in the system intact, and that's good to know!"
5,spine tingling,"This book took me thru every emotion possible, I was exhauseted after each chapter. I have given this to my daughter to read and have recommended it to everyone I know. I feel it is important to know what is out there and the good people who fight against this everyday. It is truly an important book. Thank you Sarena, I look forward to hearing from you in the future."
5,An imaginary delight!,"This is such a charming story. Little Katie is feeling gray and what does she do, but add some color and splash to her day. The illustrations are bright and fun. And while you're enjoying the story, you're learning about colors and how to make the best of a gray day in a spunky, imaginative way. I'm reading this to my 18 month old already!"
4,Flyaway Katie,"I bought this book for a very bright 2 year old niece who is already able to read very well. I was a little unsure which book to buy her but I have this and a couple of other Polly Dunbar books so thought even a bright 2 year old would enjoy this story. I was right, she loves it!!!!"
4,Handbuilt Tabeware,"Great book to add to any handbuilders library. Step by step instructions, easy to follow, wonderful ideas to expand from."
1,Scary bad,1 1/2Ripping off classical compositions and adding spookily lame vocals does not a dark challenging album make.
5,Good work,With many examples of Basic codes for checking stresses on trusses' bars and several historic notes and blueprints. Good for classrooms notes and teaching.
5,The bomb. I loved the nonstop action its a must!,This cd is very unique in its content. It took me to zones I couldnt reach with most of the rap thats on the scene today. the only thing it lacks is more music its only a maxi single I cant wait for the album.I definately think he is an up and coming new artist. Everyone who listens to rap should definately CHEEF WIT BIG CHEEF.
4,how u get on the internet?,Hey waz up to ya Cheef? I did't know you'll be on the internet with yo music. So your blowin' up my nig. Hey am bount to bounce so hit me up when you get the chance.
2,"Choose ""Developing Feeds with RSS and Atom"" instead","Far too heavy on ""tools"" rather than ""concepts"". In a year, the tools all change, but the concepts remain the same. For the same price, choose Ben Hammersley's O'Reilly book. It will be 250 focused pages that will give your the perfect lay of the syndication landscape. This Wrox book rambles on for 720 pages!"
1,Needs Focus.,This book focuses a LOT on the tools that manipulate RSS. Theory Theory Theory. Not direct to the point. Just pages and pages of flab. I would suggest to look elsewhere.
3,Great Pedometer but Only One Simple Workout,"The pedometer in this package is simple, functional and easy to set up. It displays time, mileage, steps, and calories burned. The pedometer is a colorful improvement over one I received from the City of Portland at a recent pedestrian event.The package contains a CD containing one 30-minute beginning walking workout. The workout is definitely for beginners! I'm a more advanced walker. The workout is walking with two simple exercises: shoulder rolls and lunges. I found Debbie Rocker's narration to be cheesy at first, but now that I've used the guided workout several times, I've come to appreciate her motivational talk.I bought this package for the pedometer and viewed the workout as a bonus. But, for the price, the CD should have contained another workout, with different exercises."
1,Glosses over heavy topics with short descriptions,"Rick has a series of these books and a column on MSDN. I found this book to have little value. I enjoy reading his article, but not his books. This book is a two page article drug out over 250 pages with little concrete details to provide any assistances to someone reading this book.The book reads like a dictionary, one idea after the next. I think if you have any experience you will find little use in this book."
2,Good for it's time but that time has past,"Just finished this one, again. I read it 3-4 years ago and found it interesting but has it dated! So much has changed (or is it me?) in e-commerce, even the phrase e-commerce has been supersceed by Web2.0.There are better, more current, books on the topic out there."
5,Great Book!,"Rick Freedman contributes another excellent excursion into the daily life of ""e"". His book the eConsultant does a great job of providing insight to the reader on what it takes to survive in today's ""e"" based market. A great book for anyone considering stepping into the eBusiness world...5 stars!"
5,Food Service Worker,This book was very helpful. My student aced the exam. She is willing to buy any other book or resources that will help her as a Food Service Worker.
1,Bad buy,This book is not what I expected. I thought it would cover the topics in the test but it is lacking seriously.
4,"Great keyboard, but no Windows 7 driver :-(","I own two ThinkPads, and four of these keyboards for my desktop systems. All the keyboards exhibit excellent feel and responsiveness, and having the exact same keyboard on all my systems is a huge help. The only problem is that Lenovo has discontinued this model (replacing it with one that has only TrackPoint, no UltraNav) and hence there is no Windows 7 driver available. I'd give the keyboard five stars if not for the driver issue. C'mon Lenovo, get with the program and update the drivers for this most excellent peripheral!"
2,Starts Up With NumLock,"For $100 they should have fixed the issue with it starting in NumLock. When I called IBM/Lenovo I could hear people in the background laughing. After about 8 minutes of back and forth with checking the product code and troubleshooting he finally says, ""you're using a server keyboard, thats meant for a server."" A keyboard is a keyboard. This is grossly overpriced for the trouble and lack of features."
1,Beware! - NOT as pictured!!,"Consumers please beware that the keyboard pictured is NOT the one that will be sent to you!There is NO NUMBER SECTION included in the keyboard.I just received my purchase and am very disappointed.It's still too early to tell fully, but the keyboard they sent me seems to work very well.In terms of product ONLY I'd give it a tentative 5 out of 5 stars.Just remember, PRODUCT IS NOT AS PICTURED!"
3,Got everything but good key pressure,Best quality small keyboard with a pointer device. It just doesn't have enough spring under its keys compared to most other keyboards which in the end made me return it.
1,"Bad keyboard, key bounces, etc.","I love my IBM / Lenovo Thinkpad, and hoped this keyboard would provide a comparable experience when docked. In particular, I wanted the Fn and Ctrl key placement to match - the good keyboards I already have are great, but have a standard keyboard layout, as opposed to the Lenovo / IBM Thinkpad layout, with Fn key in the lower left corner.It does NOT. It performs worse that the 10$ keyboard that it was replacing. It's keys bounce, it misses keystrokes when I am typing at speed. And I am not even a touch typist, although I am a fast 1-4 finger typist.Heck, I think that the best example of this keyboards problms will be a typing sample where I am typing on it rasonably fast. Oh, good grief... now I can't reproduc the problems. Oh, heck, wel, I guess that I can a bit, but only a few letrs are missing - in some other examples almost every 10th ltter is missing. But even the error ate in this sample s unacceptable."
4,Almost a ThinkPad UltraNav Keyboard,"Physically, this is exactly like a ThinkPad laptop. Good firm construction and laptop like light keypress operation. Logically however there is no driver to take full control of all of it's features. Things like the ability to disable the UltraNav for those with stray thumbs and the push to scroll feature of the middle trackpoint button. This is the feature that allows you to hold the button down and scroll easily in all directions which is fantastic for large visio docs, picture editing, and 3D games. Obviously not a huge killer but definitely worth a mention. There are however other drivers that allow you to control the special keys."
2,"Fragile, worth the price only if you absolutely need exactly this layout and features","I knocked off two key caps (collision with keyboard tray mounting rails) and couldn't just pop them back on, because their delicate suspension pieces were broken. I bought this for the control key layout, but that benefit was outweighed by absent Windows key. The typing feel and touchpad accuracy were okay but nothing special. For half the price, I find the Solidtek KB-540 perfectly adequate and not fragile. The USB versions of both are plug-and-play under XP for the basic touchpad functions, I didn't try more advanced functions."
5,If apples grew in bottles...,"I believe that this would be the bottle. The package was delivered very quickly and well protected. First, I had expected that it would smell like the granny smith apples - like all the apple candies that you can buy. But this was much more of a sweet apple smell, more similar to a Pink Lady or a Honeycrisp apple than the granny smith apples. So far, I have used nearly this entire bottle on seven different recipes including meringue cookies, buttermilk pie, cheesecake, and caramel candies. Each recipe has come out perfect with hints of apple flavor but not overpowering. I will definitely be buying more."
5,Spiritual War,"I am so amazed by this groups talent, I don't know how to put it into words. Talented musicians and lyricists, Fertile Ground presents their artistry incredibly. I have been listening to Spiritual War for about 4 months now, and everytime it gets recirculated into my car stereo I find a new favorite (After seeing Yesterday performed it's my current favorite). The energy that Navasha gives is absolutely phenominal. And if you enjoy the music, you have got to see them live. Every time I have seen them perform live I have left feeling that they have given me 150% of their energy.I wish them Peace, Blessings, and Continued Success"
5,Fertile Ground: True Musicians; great performers!,"Fertile Ground is unlike anyother band. With lyrics reminiscent of the positivity of Earth Wind and Fire, the jazz- soul instrumentation of John Coltrane, and the sultry vocals of Chaka Khan, Fertile Ground is sincere, talented, and never watered down. I jsut saw them in concert last weekend at a local spot in D.C. No one could resist breaking out in the chorus of natural or swaying to the positive groove of Black Is. You need to have these cds in your collection. Trust me, it is money well spent!"
5,Simply go buy this CD,"I am a acid jazz fan and I am not into much of todays R&B so I can't tell you how refreshing it was to listen to ""Spirtual War"". I love the flow and also how effectively they work the percussion into the mixture of African beats, reggae and jazz. Truly great vocalist; almost Maysa like. Not since I picked up Repercussions ""Heaven and Earth"" have I been so impressed with a group. I am now a fan!"
5,Outstanding Chopin,"This is an outstanding recording ! Favre-Kahn plays the music rather personally,her rubato exquisite,her way of revealing emotions superb.Along those of Rubinstein,Lipatti and Zimmerman ,a most beautiful and powerful interpretation of 15 waltzes ( Chopin wrote 17,some of then only published post-mortem)."
3,"Great music, however too much missing...","While it is nice to see some of this excellent bands music back in print I can only rate at 3 stars. My biggest problem is that all the releases by this band, 3 early 7"" singles, 1 LP, an unreleased 7"" b-side (Leaving), and their final 7"" Powerlines b/w The Heart is a Lonely Hunter could have fit on one cd. Why issue this recording with only the first 3 7"" singles, a few LP tracks, and 3 live tracks?"
1,Poorly Made,"The movie starts with a bathroom scene of a couple having sex which was a bit offsetting. As the movie progressed things got worse the same scene was played back over and over. The acting was horrible and there was no cohesive flow to the story- line, the point of the film was danced around, but was not clearly defined and expressed which left the audience frustrated and disappointed.I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND THIS FILM."
4,truly provoking,Purposefully MadeWhat a wonderful movie. I've also read Purposefully Made by I. Fountaine Allen and it is a print for of the movie.
3,"Kenwood KDC-X590 Design Flaws, Kenwood Issues No Recalls","Kenwood is a great brand. But when it comes to acknowledging their flaws they fall short as do many manufacturers do.My Kenwood KDC-X590 was purchased locally, legitamitly at an authorized dealer.I owned it from the middle of 2006 to the end of 2009 so about a 3.5 year life on this unit.The problem that ruins it for many if not all owners is that eventually a chip in the faceplate burns out. It seems that the best option here is just to buy a new unit.What a shame as this unit did many great things and did everything I needed.[...]I'm sticking with Kenwood for my deck unit despite this incident and have now got a KDC-HD942U.If this happens again, sorry Kenwood, I'll have to look elsewhere."
4,Recommended by college instructor,"Why did I buy the windows 2000 essential reference? At the suggestion of my college instructor in sys admin! I asked him why not a newer version? His response was that this text was the most complete of its kind and has never been equalled. He was also at a loss why the author had not updated it to represent the features in XP, or 7. He did say however, that most of the important administrative settings have changed very little and the text is still very valid, even with 7.I have yet to put the text to the test, but when I do I will be sure and report my findings!"
5,I love this book,"This is a great book for ideas and inspiration. It is full of charts for beautiful patterns, and some amazing projects. She included a good variety of modern and vintage style designs which really fired my imagination.This is not so much a book for learning techniques as it is for getting great ideas for your work."
3,hhhhhmmmmmmmm,Been a Top Gear head for many years now but this season was a bit of a disappointment. They seem to be gaining girth and the challenges and show just seemed to lack something. Not just one or two episodes but this is the first season of video that I haven't already watched 7 or 8 times.
5,Burst of Color,This is a wonderful book with lots of pictures of Native Americans in Regalia. Would be great to leave out all the time to be picked up again and again. The colors are amazing. Could also be used for ideas for the artist in you. A must have for the avid collector.
4,Great for dirt bike winter riding,"I used these on my dirt bike to extend my riding season a few months. They are extremely easy to install, and have a nice sharp edge all the way around the head. When they are in new condition riding on frozen ground feels like your tires are glued to the ground.The down side to this is they wear out relatively quickly... I got about 50 miles out of the front set and 25 out of the rears."
3,well made but didn't fit,"The Leecraft CR-1 Zero Clearance Table Saw insert is well made but did not come close to fitting my Crafstman table saw. I needed to do major ""surgery"" on the insert before I could use it."
2,Horseshoes and Hand Grenades Leecraft CR-1 throat plate.,"Says it's for most Craftsman saws (nice way to tell the customer that it probably won't fit the one you own), but too long for the 22124 Cabinet saw. Cutting it down will cut into the set screw holes. It can be used for my saw but will take some careful cutting a tweaking to make it usable. For the price I could have bought a couple of cheaper inserts that I would have likely had to tweak as well but would have spent less money for the same amount of work. Sorry two stars is all I can give for the amount of frustration involved here."
3,"Not so good, unfortunately","Well, nowadays there seems to be a tendency to consider any smaller band of the NWOBHM a fantastic, majestic, ultra talented outfit that simply did not get luck in their career. So, almost any album from that time is now called a ""classic"".This debut by Praying Mantis is not a bad album, but it is nowhere as good as some people try to make it. It's ultra-melodic, sometimes with vocal lines that remember even Foreigner (!). The best song in my opinion is ""Children of The Earth"". There are some straight and hard riffs, but absolutelynothing that will make you think ""Oh, I don't understand how these guys did not make the big leagues"".The nine songs are well crafted indeed, but are not helped very much by production."
2,"A Crusty,Old Album That Should Have Remained Out Of Print","I remember waiting for this album to be reissued after I heard their concert set with Dianno and Stratton(Live At Last). When I finally gave it a spin,the sonic equivalent of the scent of mothballs overpowered me. These songs sounded much better live. With better production and musicianship,this album could have been a pleasureable listen,but as it stands, Time Tells No Lies sounds like a demo recorded in someone's basement. None of the songs really stand out. The brothers Troy should have left this in the attic where it belongs. Nice album cover,though. Get Live At Last for superior versions of the songs on here."
5,Better each play.,"There are only a few CDs released each year that are good the first time you play them, and continue to get better with each subsequent play. Hallelujah is one of them."
4,McKim Mead & White book,"I am glad to be able to see excellent photos of the interiors of some MM&W houses. They were inventive and playful residential architects, though their firm reputation was for institutional work."
1,mindless nepotism,"This book has some nice photographs but adds nothing to already published scholarship on this topic. The author is not a professional architectural historian; he is a descendant of Stanford White. His text is gushy and uncritical, and makes only scant mention of the social and economic forces that contributed to the rise and decline of these grandiose houses."
5,Novice or Veteran Teacher? This is for YOU!,"I own a bazillion books on music teaching and have read them all. Some have multiple pages and say very little while others offer one or two tips to extract from the whole book. ""Intelligent Music Teaching"" has something powerful to read and ponder on each and every page! Rarely do I pick up a text and read it, (pretty much non-stop), cover to cover, and then start all over again with a highlighter. WOW! Thanks for providing a practical, all-encompassing, friendly, thought-provoking book that appeals to both ""newbies"" and veteran teachers (who keep reading in hopes of getting better each year)."
4,Great Fireplace Accessory,"Deliery was timely and it looks very nice by the fireplace, We used the fireplace almost daily this winter so we gave it a good ""workout"" - I would say it is a good product for the price I paid."
4,functional ash container,"This metal bucket looks just like the item displayed on Amazon, i.e. none too pretty but functional. The metal material allows placing hot ashes, and the spacing between the bottom of the bucket and the floor it is placed on avoids heating or burning the floor it stands on. It is not covered, so glowing coal placed in the bucket keeps glowing and will emit poisonous CO and CO2 gasses. It is great for the day-after ashes."
2,day time drama,everone is sleeping with each other and in the ending nothing gets resolved he doesnt get caught cheating neither does she the wife it just gos off
2,Mom of 3,"I own two of them (unfortunetly for me). The reason I give 2 stars is because the corded part of the phone works fine, answereing machine is fine. Cordless on the other hand stinks. You could charge for ever and still only have about 15 minutes of talk time, when the charge runs out, your done for atleast another 15 hours or so before it will hold a charge again. Currently looking for a new phone, I'll let ya know when I find one."
1,WORST phone ever!,"The battery on this phone lasted about 2 months before it died. I replaced it with a new one, costing me 15.00, and that one too lasted about 2 months. Now, since it's too late to return it, I basically just use it as a desktop phone and answering machine because the cordless only works for about 3 minutes before it beeps and tells me it needs to be recharged. Please don't waste your time with this product. It set me back 184.00 , and I'll never buy another Panasonic again."
1,Not Terrible,"We purchased this phone thinking it would be an upgrade. Boy, were we wrong! The cordless has to be completely dead before you are supposed to recharge it, which means in the middle of a call, it starts beeping at you. If you don't have caller ID, you can't screen calls with this answering machine because you can't hear the message as it comes in. When someone is using the computer, the cordless phone dispays a message saying the phone line is in use which uses its battery life for that charge. That means if you have kids who are on the internet, your phone won't have much of a charge once you get to use the phone line. The screen is also hard to read. I wanted the base hung up on the wall so that it wouldn't take up desk space. I have to get down on my knees to see the screen. Over all, I can live with this phone, but next time I will be more carefull about my decision."
1,!!!CAUTION!!!,"While Panasonic is consistently the most highly recommended cordless phone by electronics salespeople, this is my THIRD failure with Panasonic. While I have few problems with the corded wall mount unit, the handset has not held a charge for more than a 10 minute conversation after approximately 3 months old (after the store warrantee expired) and I am unable to say more than 'hello' on it now, before it dies out now. I have returned the phone once within the store warrantee and I have replaced the batteries twice in 2 years, which are hard to find and costly. Panasonic customer service has been neither helpful nor sympathetic to my problem. I am now researching a variety of less 'recommended' cordless phones..."
1,HORRIBLE PHONE! Save your money!,"I bought this phone this past spring and never was able talk on the cordless part of this phone for over a minute without it going dead. It is a piece of junk. My review is identical to the review Biff Dyches wrote. If I didn't know any better, I would have thought I purchased his phone. Save your money, you can definately find something better."
1,A Waste Of Money,"I thought I was getting a bargain by purchasing this, because it included the cordless handset as well as the base unit. Boy, was I wrong. I've had this phone for about a year, and I've replaced the battery twice already. Even with a brand-new battery, the handset is only good for about 45 minutes before it needs to be recharged. A big waste of money."
1,Not enough value for money,"I have had good experience with Panasonic phones in the past, so I decided to splurge and get this phone. BIG MISTAKE!!!!All the reviews highlighting the cons of this phone are dead-on. And, to add insult to injury, my unit (not even a year old) will not allow us to talk for more than 45 minutes on the cordless handset. Manual says 3 hours, we get 45 minutes. Panasonic replaced the battery once and now want us to send in the unit for replacement - of course, you have to re-enter all the information in the new unit.Folks, save your money and DO NOT buy this model."
4,Unexpensive and handyfull,"That was exactly what I was looking for: an unexpensive desk lamp, small and handy. This lamp is very flexible with its two turning points: that is usefull on my computer desk.Bad points though: No intermediate light positon (it is on/off only); fairly heavy for such a small lamp..."
2,QUENTIN TARANTINO- NOT!,"The movie starts out like it is going to be a fast paced action-drama Tarantino style and quickly becomes a bad Oliver Stone movie. The movie is far more drama than action. Too much time is spent on character interplay which was very boring. The plot of the movie is a 9/11 conspiracy nut convinces 3 people to join him in making bombs to attack the US. You never get a sense of urgency or doom or suspense in this movie. The acting was for the most part, stiff."
2,"Interesting Idea, Poor Execution","The film attempts to be politically enlightening while illustrating the possibility of home-grown terrorist cells. Regardless of your beliefs or political leanings, the presentation of 9/11 conspiracy theory allows for disbelief without rejection of the motivation of the terrorist cell. Generally the film has a number of surprises and the cinematography is beautiful.HOWEVER, the acting is so-so and borders on forced at times. The plot leaves larges holes and the ending makes no sense. The flashbacks are meant to be intriguing, no doubt, and while in many cases they work well, they are over-used. Overall, the plot and acting are unbelievable to the point that watching the film becomes painful. It's a shame that such an interesting concept was so thoroughly trashed."
1,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,Intereting. This film attempts to tie George orwell' book 1984 to the root of 9/11. Unfortunately it only verifies that George orwell was right. Only Big Brother would have produced a film like this to use as propaganda. Big Brother lives on. This film proves George Orwell was right. Big Brother wrote this script and produced the movie.
1,-5 STARS !!!,"Take a backett and mix in every stereotype on ""insurgencies"" we've been fed up from the cold war to a minute ago and add bad screening, an impossible script, amature photography and an aura of nonsense in every frame and you have ""The Insurgents!"" I wish there was an option of -5 stars! It would still make it look good!"
3,Three Stars Is Being Rather Generous...,"Don't get me wrong, it truly is a great multi-purpose umbrella - HOWEVER, it has a horrible locking mechanism with a hair-trigger. It is constantly springing opening on me (and usually at the worst possible time). I have had to start attaching the straps every time I close it - but it still springs open when you release the straps if the mechanism has been unknowingly triggered in the interim. Naturally, that can be VERY FRUSTRATING.For this company to design such an excellent sun blocking, wind resistant umbrella and then stick that cheap, hair-trigger catch on it simply makes no sense. Perhaps made more cents than sense? But, c'mon guys, when people are plunking down that much for an umbrella, that's no time to be cheap. Tsk, tsk."
4,"It is a wobble blade for crud sake, what do you expect?","You will never get a flat smooth dado from a wobble blade! This is a quick and dirty way to cut dados if you just need a groove. It works great for rough construction purpose.If you want clean smooth dados then spend the money and get a stacked dado set, otherwise expect to get the rabbit plane out or a sanding block and add some elbow grease.This product does what you expect for the price you pay..."
1,Too wide for most table saws,"Great idea but falls short on execution..The arbor pieces are difficult to orient on the blade, is too wide for most table saw's (especially the direct drive ones).Suggest a small amount of glue on the 2 inner parts that touch the blade... once mounted it takes a bit of adjusting to get it just right..hard too line up the fence due to the wobble feature,, what tooth is the closest to the fence?... makes pretty good cuts.. ended up buying a much better table saw, and use my stacked dado instead..Before you purchase measure your arbor length is long enough, I think the minimum on the package state's 1 3/8..."
1,Not worth it's weight in rocks.,"My problem with this product is that contrary to claims, it will cut no less than a 3/8's dado. Not much good for slots for 3/16 plywood. A real piece of junk. I returned mine."
1,Garbage > This Movie,"This movie was an absolute waste of my 3.99 rental, save your money and time on something else, this has taught me to read the reviews first from now on."
2,37 minutes before the 1st zombie appeared. Really?!?,It wasn't bad as low budget movies go. But I was expecting more zombies. When I pay for a zombie movie I want more than 3 zombies. The acting wasn't great. The dialogue was just unrealistic and not natural. But if you can look past all that it wasn't bad.
1,Wasted Zombie Flick,"Did you ever wonder why in zombie films they always start with the zombie apocalypse in full swing and not at the very beginning? This is why. Given this is supposed to be the beginning of the apocalypse I could understand there only being few zombies, but the film just dragged and dragged. The characters were generic and forgettable and an overall waste of time. Being a zombie fan I was disappointed in this film, and I'd advise you to stay away from it."
3,Decent Low Budget Zombie Flick,"I've seen a lot of low budget zombie fare and this is a good example of doing it mostly right. The acting is good throughout, if noticeably not pro level. The effects are few and done well. The idea behind the movie is unique and a cool take on how and why a zombie outbreak could start. Like all good low budget movies they've kept the locations few and focused and concentrated on a small cast of characters under pressure. The production values are good, the sound is clear and the overall look of the film is consistent and well done. And most importantly, the story and characters are engaging and keep you interested throughout most of the film.Well done to the makers, I hope to see more from them in the future."
3,"I lke this type of movie, but this one was not the greatest I have ever seen","But, this one was not the best that I have ever seen.Maybe I,m comparing it to The Walking Dead and it can'tbe beat."
3,Chemistry Textbook,Slow receipt and well used. Lived a rough public school classroom life. Much use given. But worth the price paid.
4,excelent,"I received the book in a very good condition and very fast, thanks for an excelent service."
4,exactly what I needed for my daughter,I needed to find a copy of this book for my daughter because her school did not have enough copies. I was having a hard time locating one but found it here on Amazon and it is in excellent condition. Now my daughter has the book at home to do her homework.
4,bad,Its kinda stupid how this good book doesnt have any good summarys on the computer!Isnt that reallly stupid?So please write a summary!
5,"NOW, I'm ready for the holiday season!","I just finished eating Thanksgiving dinner with my family while listening to this cd. I bought it last year, and ahve been looking forward to Thanksgiving so I could listen to it again!I work in retail, and it is so irritating how we are rushed through every holiday now. I refuse to listen to Christmas music until Thanksgiving so I can really appreciate each holiday, and savor the anticipation of Christmas.I just love this collection, and I wish that it didn't have such a ""circus-y"" title. I have tons of Christmas cds, but I think this will always be my favorite. Last year I had to commute an hour and a half to work each way! I am very thankful that I don't have to do that anymore, but if you are a commuter, this cd really helps prevent road rage! I was less stressed when I got to work, and less stressed when I got home."
2,Greatest Christmas Show on Earth?,"AMAZON users:I purchased this music CD, entitled ""The Greatest Christmas Show On Earth"" through Amazon... HOWEVER, what arrived was a CD entitled ""The #1 Christmas Album"". While the double CD received seems to contain much the same material as ""The Greatest Christmas Show On Earth"" CD, I was NEVER notified that the item I ordered would arrive under a different title, which is disappointing. It seems the issuing company thought it best to take my money and send the CD without explanation. And so it goes... a bit of frustration, but the CD seems to be substantially what was ordered. Note to the issuing companies: SEND WHAT YOU SELL!"
5,glimpsing a zen community,"I very much enjoyed this book. It is based on the real experiences of the author when he stayed at a Zen community in America. He did an excellent job making it come alive on the page. You feel you got a real idea from a gifted story teller of what actually spending time in a community like this would be like. This account is a valuable contribution to literature on Eastern thought, Buddhism, etc. Walking the path is what Zen is about and this book gives those that are curious a glimpse of what this can entail for spiritual seekers. I read this book years ago and have not forgotten it."
3,A little taller would have been better,"This console provides multiple options to my family. It would have been better had it sat a little higher, but will meet the needs of our household. Customer Service was outstanding. Please congratulate them for me. I did order incorrectly, the color was wrong, and they fixed it for me, and made everything wonderful. Very fast service, very polite. A joy to work with"
3,Over The Top Fun!,"This film was fun, a bit silly but still fun. The acting is very B. (No Oscar performances) The premiss was almost believable, Strange things do happen in the mortuary business. The characters are all over the top caricatures, but that was what made it fun. It's not particularly scary, it's more of a rowdy romp in graveyards with creepy people. If it were a 1950ies black and white film, it would have be considered terrifying in it's day. But we require more to be scared these days.The music was the most professional aspect of the film, it was actually quite good. It was an interesting blend of classical orchestral music and head banging heavy metal. The ""Revolting Dead Theme Song"" played at the end could be a Halloween favorite, if anyone were to ever hear it.I like happy endings, in this film justice is served, and bad guys get their what they deserve. Now we are safe to back about our business. Or are we?"
3,shop fox block plane,"had to flatten sole and sharpen blade, but that's expected with all new and vintage planes. Made in China, quality is just not there. Lot of fine tuning to get it to work...the iron bed is not machined very well and the cap lock doesn't work smoothly. If you want a good quality block plane you will have to buy a vintage plane, none of the crap out there today even comes close to operating like it should. Once you clean it up some it makes a fine paper weight."
3,Key Case Review,I am a landlord to a 5/6 small commercial units & found it difficult to manage the keys.This case makes it much easier to manage & identify keys. I have on occassions had other landlords showing me property that they owned & it amazed me the amount of keys & the time spent trying to find the right key. This case is simple & ideal for these situations where you need to take keys ourside the office / home.It was difficult to find a suitable product on the market & they appear to be on the rather expensive side.The Delivery cost from USA to Ireland was very expensive - granted delivery was was much quicker than I expected or was required. Perhaps it could have been delivered cheaper if it came via amazon.co.uk if speedy delivery was not a requirement. I couldn't find the product on amazon.co.uk or any other European site.
5,The best of the best in snipers,"This was an excellent description of the amazing feats accomplished by ""Gunny"" Hathcock in a time when technology was poor. The author takes some leeway in presenting the end of Hathcock's life but the his story is indeed interesting and will hold your attention until you have completed the book. Old and young soldiers alike will want to read this book if they have not done so yet."
5,Silent Warrior,"I read Silent Warrior before reading, Marine Sniper, so I loved it, I had many friend and family members in Viet Nam and of course this was the first ""war"" covered daily on the news, Viet Nam was not history to me it was my daily life and times. I don't come from a military family, although I married into one. I didn't know much or anything about Hathcock, I found this book to be full of information you DON'T learn in school or on the 6 o'clock news. Those of you complaining about the two books should be complaining there isn't enough written about the heros of Viet Nam and how bad they were treated coming home. I did read Marine Sniper after Silent Warrior and I personally liked Silent Warrior better...just lucky I guess..and for those of you wondering I am NOT related to Charles Henderson tho I am priviledge to know him."
4,Something that must be said,This is a book that tells a story that is little known beyond the ranks of the military. It should be known by all as it is one of the things that has maintained our freedom thru the years. The book is well written and to the point.
3,A copy of the first book: Marine Sniper.,Charles Henderson did not need another book to tell two or three new stories about sniper legend Carlos Hathcock.A improved and updated new edition with three more chapters would have sufficed.If you have read Marine Sniper you can skip this one.
1,"same book, except worse","I'll keep this short. Marine Sniper is an astonishing account of Carlos Hathcock's unique courage and dedication during his service in Vietnam. Anyone interested in the Marine Corps, the Vietnam War, sniping, or military heroes must read Marine Sniper. And if you read it, then you won't have to read Silent Warrior. Why? Because Silent Warrior is the exact same book, except not nearly as well done. The same exact stories - the Apache, the NVA general, the Frenchman, Burke's death, the VC sniper hunt, Hathcock's rehabilitation of his unit upon his return to Vietnam - are retold in Silent Warrior, except in sketchier form, and frequently intermingled with the author's fabricated conjectures about Hathcock's state of mind as he died of MS. Don't buy this book. It is a shameless ripoff, and a transparent money grab by Charles Henderson, who apparently couldn't think of anything new to write so he wrote the same book twice. This is a disappointing waste of money. Avoid, avoid."
2,hathcock fans only,"after reading the book i would still buy it again, but only becuase it is about Carlos Hathcock. this book is just material that didn't make his first one. if you want to buy a good book buy the first one."
2,Repeats information from the 1st book The Marine Sniper story,My husband is reading the Silent Warrior..he was disappointed because it was repeating alot of information from the first book { The Marine Sniper story..which he really liked}
3,Mixed feelings,"I finished reading this book with very mixed feelings. The author deserves infinite praise for ""Marine Sniper"", bringing Carlos Hathcock's story to a far broader audience than previously knew about him. To the extent that this second book helps get the story out to a newer generation of readers, that's terrific too. However, as a book on its own merits, it wasn't all that great. Other reviewers have criticized the device of presuming to know Carlos' thoughts in his final days. It made me a bit uncomfortable as well. All told, I came away with the sense that Henderson tried to stretch a 2nd book out of too little new material. If I was advising a friend on a first read about Carlos Hathcock, I'd recommend the first book instead of this one. But, just to flip flop one last time, bringing ANY additional material about such an amazing man to the public deserves credit. I said I had mixed feelings..."
5,A Good Continuation of Carlos Hathcock's Story,"A very good book, continuing the tales and adventures of Carlos N. Hathcock II in Vietnam. The book covers his second tour in Vietnam and provides a good closing to the story of his life after the Marines.Gives a good look into the problems he suffered in his later years both with his health and mental state, and how he was able to overcome anything that life threw his way. A great man of ethics and principal who serves as a positive role model for young men."
1,Cheap puzzle,"All the cut shapes are the same, so it's very easy for my 3-1/2 year old to force pieces in the wrong place. The pieces also seem thin and flimsy. The coolest thing about the puzzle is the lunchbox/carrycase. All in all, the quality is much less than I expect from Ravensburger .The Ravensburger ""Thomas Giant Floor Puzzle (24 Pc)"" is a far superior product, but no longer complex enough for my kid."
1,Not a good puzzle - for any age,"This puzzle was disappointing. Almost all the pieces are basically the same shape, so every piece fits with just about every other piece. Also, they're very thin pieces which won't stand up to much 3-4 year old abuse. And even when you put them together they don't really ""snap"" into place so they just fall apart when you try to add the next piece to the puzzle - very frustrating, especially for a young puzzle builder.We have the Animals in the Barn Puzzle and it is much better quality all around."
5,great puzzle,my 3 year old daughter loves this puzzle! The pieces are sturdy and the picture is just complicated enough for her to put together. I think this is a great puzzle for preschoolers.
2,Poorly made,"This puzzle was a disappointment. The pieces are poorly made and don't stay connected. I thought the picture would be the same on the tin and have the circus animals. On the upside, the tin is very nice and my son loves to use it to carry his trains around. The Giant Thomas floor puzzle (24 pieces) was much better."
5,5000 pound man,"Roland Kirk by any name is one of the greatest phenomena to play and compose jazz in the whole 20th century, a man of incomparable musical talents, great humor and humility, he reportedly ate saxophones for breakfast. If you know Jazz you already knew this, if you're new to jazz, get all of his records and you will soon be searching out the rest of the great masters of the idiom. It's too constricting to say he played hard bop, while that's the prevalence, his style is personal and all-encompassing. He even puts the most excellent lyrics to Mingus' ""Goodbye Pork pie Hat"" and Coltrane's ""Giant Steps"". (Joni Mitchell's Lyrics to pork pie belie the fact she was clueless as to what the song was about).Jazz is the teacher, funk is the preacher! (James Blood Ulmer)"
4,Very Helpful,"I read this book cover to cover and it really helped me decide to apply to American U. I was hesitant about applying because of certain information i had heard, but reading this guide really helped me to understand the atmosphere of the school and it ultimately led me to my decision to apply there. This is a great guide for anyone who is strongly considering American and wants to hear about it form a student perspective."
2,defective,There are two buttons one for the rabbit ears (clit stimulation) and one for the dildo (vaginal stimulation). The button for the rabbit ears works fine but the button that is supposed to turn the dildo on to rotate does not work at all. Very disappointed.
1,Disappointed,It was defective. The vibrator feature never worked & while showing my husband it when he got home from work the rotating pearl feature quit working.
3,Superior quality but handles are very short. Ideal for those with small to medium size hands.,"Pro: No spot weld, solid piece of 18/10 stainless steel.Smooth finish.No defects.Quality is very good.Can last a lifetime.No health hazard.Con: Handles are too short for those that have large hands.If one wears glove size large and up will find the handle uncomfortable and awkward due to lack of full handle grip."
3,Pricey and possibly not worth it,"These measuring cups will undoubtedly outlast me. They are heavy and do not have riveted handles like those you see in most discount stores. I was drawn to these after I had two sets of cups fail on me in less than a year. The cups broke away at the rivets while I was scooping flour or sugar. Very annoying. That will definitely not happen with these. But they are so heavy that they are cumbersome. And I do not particularly care for the rounded bowl with a lip. This makes them almost too wide and hard to manuver in and out of bags and jars where I store my dry goods. On the positive side, they seem very accurate and are certainly sturdy. I wonder how the markings will wear over time. Overall, I think they are costly considering the design flaw, but it has proven very difficult to find measuring cups that are both durable and designed to my liking. For now it's the best I've found."
1,Product is a hazard to life and limb,"This blade should never be used when cutting any hardwood like oak, maple, walnut or birch, The kerf to body ratio is too close for many hardwoods. I had to polish down the blade body with a grinding stone in order to make it at all usable. Waxing (With Bee's wax) helps. The blade splintered bamboo laminate on crosscuts no matter what I tried."
5,"I've used this blade for years, no problems","Don't believe the previous review. I've had this on my Delta contractor saw, and it cross cuts to near sanded finish. And as far as ripping goes, I've cut Ipe, red oak, mahogany, maple, birch, bloodwood, padauk, cherry, and even more veneered plywoods with no splintering. I've installed a 100 tooth Oldham crosscut blade on my chopsaw, and it crosscuts to near sanded finish also. If you get a chance to use one of these, you won't be disappointed. I'm not. Just looking for a flat top blade so I can cut better tenons."
2,Kids didn't like it!,My children have a couple of these CD's that we play in the car. They don't care for this one though. Not sure why...
2,Post-modern jargon and Marxist claptrap,"This was really a disappointing book. It reads like an indoctrination manual full of post-modern jargon and Marxist claptrap, just one cliche after another. It does have some information, which gives it some value, but otherwise it's just way too ideological. It could have been a much better book without that."
2,Dry as toast and just as unreadable...,"WAY too dry and scholarly, I couldn't even get past the foreword. It is not for the average reader who just wants a history of Japanese film."
2,Just an average live concert,"There is no such group or musician that could be compared to the outstanding live performances of the Deep Purple, Rainbow, Led Zepplelin, Pink Floyd, Y. Malmsteen, or Rick Wakeman."
1,Never ordered it,Never ordered itNever ordered it and I resent this way of trying to hook me into itGoodbyeSo long
4,"Welles's Life, Part Two","The second volume of Simon Callow's admirable biography of Welles does full justice to Welles's work in radio, which extended far beyond his Mercury Theater On the Air. A great read about a great artist."
4,Best for one person,"I bought it for $10 a few years ago. This is great if you can ""cook"" at work. Just throw a frozen hamberger patty and you have something to eat in 10 mins. But the surface is really small, so you can only cook small quantity at a time. Also cleaning is not as easy as they say. You can't throw it in the dishwasher. The grill outside gets sticky from the greasy fume so in that respect it takes more work to clean. Inside is pretty much wiping off the juice and the residue but I use soapy water and a sponge so I have to do that a few times as well. If you are single, live in a bachelor/studio or stove-less environment like a student, this is a great addition to a microwave."
2,Platter great. Do not order from Amazon because no sleeve is included,I was very satisfied with the sizzle platter itself but after 3 tries with the company I never did receive the pot handle sleeve that I really wanted. If I would of known that I would never receive it with the platter I would of ordered from another company. The handle gets real hot when on the grill and I like having the sleeve. I have one from another company and it came with the sleeve. They should not advertise it with a sleeve if it does not come with one.
1,not delivered,I know this is a great Edgar Allen Poe story. I was never successful in getting it delivered to my Kindle for Mac application. This is the first time I have ever had this problem.
5,Wish there was more,A shame this is a short (really short) story. But it inspired one of the coolest characters in literature. A must read for Poe fans.
4,A classic from one of the greatest writers!,A classic from one of the greatest writers!I've read it many times in the past and always like to get back to it again.
5,A Great Classic,"This was a very good Gothic short story written by Poe. I think that this is something that should be read by everyone at some point, as it only takes five to ten minutes to read."
5,Re: Edgar Allan Poe,"I love Edgar Allan Poe's work, but this would have to be the best because of all the symbols he uses in his style of writing. Most of his work deals with the dark-side of reality and fiction, and I love it."
3,The Masque of the Red Death,First Poe book I have ever read. Not use to short stories but it was ok. Gonna give another a try.
5,Good supplier,"I would order from this supplier again. Book arrived on time, in excellent condition. certainly a reliable source for more books."
5,Just Wish There Was A Movie...,"Absolutely LOVED this! It was a bit dark, and, if I didn't have so much else going on, I'd sit and write an entire review of the whole work itself on how vivid the imagery was, how perfectly described and necessary the different characters were placed in this short story... I digress. LoL Plus, this particular version for the Kindle is absolutely free! The story doesn't take but maybe half and hour tops to read all the way through it. So, get this right now, put it on your Kindle, and get some place comfortable 'cause Mr. Poe's about to plunge you into the darkness as only he knows how. :D"
2,Not one of my favorite Poe stories,"I just think that Masque of the Red Death is a little too underdeveloped for me. Compared to The Raven, Masque of the Red Death does not do an effective job of transporting the reader through a journey of emotion, space, and time."
4,The Masque of the Red Death,I love this book because of the way it reaches out with in-depth deitale and how it tells you what happins in the book and the highlights are plenty and long and numerous in the book and I just like the book and hope you enjoy it.
3,Grizzly G2790 Good Value,The G2790 is a good value for the money. Not the highest quality as far as machine tools go. I needed to do some fine tuning to get it to work well. I had to use gringing paste to flatten the knife guide and take some rock out. I also had to devise a way to take the slop out of the devices that hold the knife holder to the table. After my reworking the grinder performed well.
5,Excellent Product,"I had a leaky sunroof (it's not draining properly and cleaning the channels repeatedly has done nothing) on my truck and have tried quite a few products already. But none of them could hold up to the Florida heat and weather, and would end up deteriorating and crumbling. I tried this product on the seal around the window and have had no leaking whatsoever. This stuff comes out like a thick black, tar-like caulking and is NOT easily cleaned from the hands or anything else you get it on, so be careful. You'll need gas or WD-40 (or something similar) to remove this stuff. Or just wear gloves, if you're messy like me. When it dries, though, it turns into almost a thick rubber-like seal that has elasticity and works extremely well; it is still holding up with no problems at all. Another bonus is that because it's a silicone seal, you can easily ""peel"" this stuff off if you ever want to remove it. Just pry up a part of the coating, and it'll all peel away in a big strip."
4,Great Jazz Guitar,"Next to Django, not much measures up; but this is a credible imitation on his style with a tight knit group to sew it all together."
5,Great sound track for a great movie.,This sound track from Woody Allen's movie Sweet and Lowdown is fabulous. The guitar renditions are exceptional as is the story.It is a must listen to and must see.
4,"Good guitar, fair support","Howard Alden is very good, but not quite as good as Django, according to the script, and that's what you get in this CD--some fine 1930's-sounding guitar renditions of jazz standards. When Alden is supported just by a rhythm section, it's great, but when the loud, unimaginative wind section joins in the results are so-so."
4,"Not what I'd expected, but good","The soundtrack was such a key part of Allen's film, such an integral and immensely entertaining part of it that I bought the soundtrack--only to discover that the solos featured so prominently in the film are not included on the CD. That's a huge disappointment because they were, quite simply, wonderful.That said, guitarist Howard Alden and the others (notably the fine Bucky Pizzarelli on rhythm guitar and Kelly Friesen on bass) do a terrific job in replicating the music of the era. The selections are great: ""I'll See You in My Dreams,"" ""Just a Gigolo,"" and ""Limehouse Blues"" are all classics and very well done.The CD doesn't (because of the absence of those solos) have quite the impact of the actual music from the film but as a stand-alone item, for those who enjoy the sounds of the 30s, it's well worth having on its own merits.Recommended."
4,1st season ok,I found that the first season was an ok season. the new season is alot better. But the whole series is a great series.
1,disappointed..,"raekwon had the rhymes,but he just needed better production...RZA cant do everything but he should have stuck wit TRUE MASTER,and the ever improving dj MATHEMATICS..i hate i bought rae's new album..."
5,WOW,I think this is ta fattest album that wu-tang has ever released.I just don't have any words for it......................
3,Hot but not Cuban Links,"Chef has tried to be a bit different on this one, he still rocks but there is something missing, don't get me wrong, Chef is one of the hottest in the Wu but...on Cuban Links the duo were classic, Chef without Ghostface is like Wu without Tang! A good buy though, worth a listen."
2,Ask Yourself..................,Why did he have to drop this album?? Its got two good songs. I loved Cuban Linx but this was too much American Cream Team and not enough hunger.
3,Wonderful lyrics marred by decent production.,"Raekwon is a brilliant lyricist as shown by his first CD Cuban Linx. Immob. has much superior lyrics and better imagery particular with the underworld elegant gentleman debonair thug images which lace the tracks (and the videos esp. New York...) with the Godfather theme running throughout. Cuban Linx wasn't cohesive but had the shining track classics. This album is lovely on its own and is worth hearing for the wonderful efforts of Rae's storytelling. On the other hand, you will find that Rae needs his partner Tony Starks as a contrasting persona on the CD which on this effort he doesn't appear on... Oh well, I can't wait until RZA comes back from China with his banging beats on the Ghost Dog and the next Wu album which we are all anticipating.Rae's new album is worth checking out with his elegant and suave polished effort..."
4,The best of the second round of Wu albums . . . .,"Ok, so it's not Cuban Linx, we all know by now that the second album will never match the fist one. I thought this album was going to be garbage after hearing Beneath the Surface, T2000, etc. I was very pleasantly surprised by this album.Of course Rae's going to talk about his BS stories, but as long as you accept that, I think the songs are pretty tight. I must admit that I play about 8 songs on this album a lot. Although the beats aren't RZA made (which may or may not be good at this point) I think they are straight. I would drop any of my stuff to most of the beats on this album.Maybe I'm so impressed because I had such LOW expectations for this album, but it gets a lot of play in my CD changer in my car, which is filled with classics.As long as you don't mind Rae's sometimes wild style, and his sometimes akward subject matter, this is a good album."
2,Suspect! What happened,"What happened! The album failed. There was no RZA production. Even if there is no RZA production, he should of at least have some beats provided by Inspectah Deck, 4th Disciple or True Master. As for the lyrics what happened to the other Wu tang members, especially Ghost. I don't know what happened here. This album seems suspect to me.Reakwon is still one of my favorite Wu-tang MC's besides Inspectah Deck and GZA and others. Just that the album is kind of nervous. Some tracks make me wanna use the toilet. I hope his next album is going to be hotter to def than this."
2,Again......................WTF????????,"This album sucked super @$$!!!!!!!! Again.........WTF? Power, Sneakers, and Live from NY was tight. Everything, and I do mean everything was TRASH!!!!!!! The mighty chef even jocked (yes I said jocked) production credits off of Swizz Beats. Again........WTF? This project is supreme clientele demostration of a sophomore jinx, FO REAL!!!!! To be honest, I haven't taken Wu-Tang seriously since this bullish. The album STILL SUCKS!!!!!!!Again............WTF???????Peace!!!!!!!!"
2,2 stars because there's about 2 good songs,"what happened to ""we more rugged than raw""wu-tang is my favorite hip-hop group, but i have been dissapointed in the last few releases.they aren't nearly as good as 36 chambers.all the people that gave this cd 5 stars dont know nothing about wu.they probably got the cd cause they seen the commercial on MTV or something.there were only 2 good reviews out of the 32.3 now."
4,Rae's back w/ another hot joint!,"As expected the verbal assaulter came back w/ another dime, this time blessin the cd w/out Rza,and his rightside man Ghost Face...Rae uses his stealthy array of lyrics to impress....allthough the beats are not as good as those on Cuban Linx(although not many are)...it proves to be a good return for Shallah Raekwon."
3,Chef advances,"This album is severely underrated. 100 Rounds and Sneakers are jams that will crank on any avenue, plus the references to leadership, growth, and maturity are well-appreciated..."
4,Rae does it again w/o Ghostface,"It's too early to call it a classic like the previous album. If your a Raekwon fan you won't be disappointed. I do miss hearing Ghostface on this album. Ghostface/Raekwon are like Meth/Redman, even better. You'll miss Ghost. I guess that's why I didn't give it a five. Hooks were a lot stronger on the previous album. Rae comes off as usual. Good workout album. madbeats@earthlink.net"
1,what happened to the original wu-tang clan?,"...Raekwon is getting corny. He is definitely getting commercial. Again I ask, what happened to the original wu-tang? It is all commercial and weak. As far as I am concerned- the Clan has fell off. The only good M.C.'s in the clan are the Gza/Genius and the Rebel INS-Inspektah Deck for you suckas. I am now left to reminisce about the days gone past when that Wu-Tang ""W"" stood for the realest hip-hop you could find. Now, I am forced to dig deeper beneath the surface for my soundtracks to life. To the Wu-Tang Clan...WHY?"
3,Most Slept On - pick it up!,"There are some serious bangers on this album. Sneakers and F*** Them are at the top of the list. F*** Them is a vintage colab with Method Man; a Wu-banger to the fullest extent. Rae shows great improvement in his lyrics throughout.Unfortunately, it seems he was feeling pressure for this record to top Cuban Link, and he made some mistakes because of this: Number 1, being that this was a late '99 release, there are some definite Puffyisms in the production. He went a little commercial on the production and it all doesn't age well. Number 2, there is no Ghostface colab. It seems Rae my have been trying to answer doubters by going it alone. Well, Rae and Ghost are maybe the dopest tag team of all-time. Immobilarity could have used one of their classic back-and-forths. Peace."
4,cool but...,this is alright.. i mean that its not bad but it is.. well.. rae is in sophomore jinx its worse than his previous album.. some songs are good but some songs of 21 tracks are just SO So ...youd better get his first album!!!
1,Big let down,"Being a huge Wu fan, and having been blown away by Rae's Cuban Linx album, I copped this fist day out expecting a lot, not another Cuban Linx, but a quality Wu release. This is NOT a Wu-Tang album, no RZA, or even any Wu producers. 2 Wu-Tang appearnaces, including a played out Method Man, and a hot Masta Killa verse. The production is decent at times, but other times it sounds like Swizz Beats Casio beats, I have to give props to Raekwon's lyrics, and for trying something new, but if you want a raw, hardcore Wu album, cop GZA's, Ghostface Killah's or U-God's because they kept the Shaolin Style alive."
4,Call Premo and RZA,lyrics are dope as usual for Raekwon the dopest stroyteller next to Slick Rick this cd has one big name producers Pete Rock on a shoe track worth the money for die hard Wu and Rae fans9.5 of 10 lyrics 4.5 of 10 beats
2,incomplete information,"This is a nice book to read if you are mildly interested in bredding tropical fishes. If you really want to do it, you will not find the specific information you may want to have in this book. For example, in breeding Betta Splendens the author suggests water temp and aquarium size. Unforunately, water quality may well be much more important. What is the recommended Ph? Water hardness and other chemical factors if properly reproduced as the fish experiences it in the wild will help in spawning the fish. This kind of lack of information repeats itself throughout the book. Luckily it is out of print so you won't have to suffer..."
2,Decent chain ring,"I had real bad chain suck lately so I bought 3 FSA chain rings for my mountain bike. After I did a little study, there is really not much difference in the mountain ring or the road ring except the appearance design. Both use pretty much the same alloy. I installed the chain rings with a new a Shimano chain, tuned the derailleurs, lube the drivetrain, and off for a neighborhood hilly ride. And guess what, while I was going up hill, I still got a chain suck as I down shift from the big chain ring to the middle chain ring. The chain scraped a deep scratch on the teeth of the middle chain ring. The rings were supposed to provide smooth shifting while riding under stress going up hill. However, it does not have any problem while riding flat or downhill, shift is smooth. But the rings can only get 2 stars."
3,2 1/2 Stars -- Too Slow-Moving And Not Enough Action!,"The Traitor has an interesting plot -- A British secret agent is captured by the Nazis and, in a decision some considered to be treason, acts out of love and strikes a bargain with his captors. The deal is that in return for his wife who is interned in a concentration camp, the agent agrees to lead a clandestine unit of the SS called the British Free Corps. However, while the author has created an interesting premise and credible characters, the plot didn't move along at a brisk enough pace and the amount of action was somewhat limited for my taste. Further, Walters got too bogged down in describing the motivations for what seemed like every move and thought of the main character. All in all, I'd rate The Traitor as ""fair."" It is not a bad book; it's just not a book I'd recommend that you rush out to read."
3,Exciting WW II based on little known fact novel,"I enjoyed this novel about the little known British Free Corps, so much I eagerly looked up the BFC on the internet. For those who enjoy fact based WW II novels, I suggest that you read this.The story is very plausible. The only problem I have with this novel (which kept me from giving it a much higher rating) is the absolutely abysmal editing. There are way too many grammatical errors which ruin the natural flow of the story. A good editor would have caught the errors and corrected them--I never thought a Briton would so skewer the King's language!!!!"
3,A Flawed Anti-Hero,"This novel is focused on the classic dilemma of whether family or country should come first. Lockhart makes mistakes, causes the death of others and eventually seeks redemption through trying to do both - the finding and saving his wife and by coincidence a chance to save his country. It is a reasonable account of a failing Nazi Reich, a bombed out Berlin, secret agents, the desperate attempts to turn the allies against the Russians, the super-weapons and the recruitment of other nations to feed its propaganda. At times the novel is outlandish and improbable but does entertain and presents a different but occasionally frustrating viewpoint on the World War II story with a storming finish."
4,Pretty good read,I received this book last weekend and enjoyed the plot line. It did drag a bit at times with too much detail but overall I would recommend it to my friends.I did find it interesting that the author used some of the pseudonyms of some of the BFC members out of Jackals of the Reich.But overall a pretty good book.
5,Made Easy is the Bottom Line,"This book is exceptionally well written and presents both novice and expert topics using an example driven approach that stimulates and motivates the reader. Both authors stress the most important lessons to learn in each chapter clearly and the reader comes away with expert experiences that other books just do not capture. The examples are in Eiffel which is another bonus as not only do you learn Windows development principles, but you also gain an indepth understanding of object-oriented principles that are lacking in many other languages. Eiffel is not a prerequisite at all as I had not even heard of the language before reading the book, and I would definitely recommend the book to those wanting to discover an experts opinion on Windows programming with the added benefit of learning object-oriented principles at the same time."
4,Canadian country bands debut,"Canadian country band's debut album is terrific. But why only 9 songs? Anyway, the 9 songs that are here are for sure worth the price. Their version of George Jones 'Rain Rain' is especially good. They are also pretty good songwriters, as their subsequent albums will reveal more of. On this album there are 3 originals by Keith and one by Joan. A very good traditional type of country...recommended."
1,Nonsense!,"This ""story"" is pure rubbish! Previous post laid out the pioneers that were left out of the ""story"". DO NOT BUY THIS UNLESS YOU LIKE TO BURN MONEY!"
4,totally mind blowing,"I have personally met this person and with the things he says he truly believes in, meaning that he does walk the walk when he talks the talk. I truly admire his selfless persona as well as his humility. He has a lot of influences that shine through in this cd from Jars of Clay to Jason Mraz. He uses strings and luscious acoustic guitar patterns amongst a beat that keeps you in the groove. Truly incendiary."
3,creepy as hell,"This is unquestionably the most disturbing book I have ever read. I tend to think I deal with disturbing subject matter very well, but this book messed me up for days. It's revolting. I don't mean that it's badly written, or even that it's not worth reading, but you better know what you're getting into before you read it. If you can't deal with *extremely* graphic sexual violence, or you don't want to read about a girl on an absolutely relentless path of self-destruction, don't read this."
1,Great Christian message bad storyline,This book has a great message but the storyline was horrible. I would suggest that you save your money. I'm sorry but you could not pay me enough money to read this book again. If your looking for a good read get The Summons by John Grisham that book was awesome. If your looking for action your looking in the wrong place. Maybe next time Mr.Bunn.
4,This book changed my life!,"I was praying for an answer for a carreer change. Before I finished the first page of this book, God gave me the answer. I was one that I would have never have thought of or even accepted without divine intervention. Thank you Mr. Bunn for writing this book."
3,"Great cup, but buy it locally","It's ridiculous to have this cup shipped to you when you can possibly go to your local outdoor supply shop and get it for less than $2, like I did. The cup is fine. 1.7oz weight, holds 12 fluid ounces."
2,"Brilliant idea, poorly executed","At first glance, this novel appears to be about a human ""imprisoned"" (and yet saved) by his invincible armor. But that is veneer. Really, this book is a diatribe against the stereotypical, mindless, bureaucratic institutions we all have dealt with at one time or another. And it's the story of a pathetic hero who is totally helpless against his institution, the ""army."" Put him in armor and surround him with Ants, and he's brilliant. Put him back in the barracks, and he's a spineless victim, whining his way to oblivion. By the end of the book, the author absolutely beats these themes to death -- to a PULP! ""Bureaucracies are stupid and evil! And the people who serve them are helpless victims who are powerless to change their fate!""Yeah-sure. I felt like the author spent more time ranting on his soap box than he did telling what could have been a really great story. No thanks."
4,THE HUMAN SPIRIT,I READ THIS BOOK EVERY YEAR OR TWO. FELIX AND JACK ARE WELL WRITTEN CHARACTERS THAT ARE NOT WHAT THEY SEEM AND MORE THAN WE EXPECT. THE AUTHOR DOES A GREAT JOB BRINGING THE PERSONALITIES OUT IN THE BOOK AND LETTING US SEE THAT THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT SIDES TO A MAN.
4,Ubermonkey gives thumbs up,THE GOOD: The story itself is wonderful. The perspective switches between Felix and Crow effortlessly and both plotlines are interesting and worth the read. I did not find any dry spots and there weren't any pages I read because I felt I had to. Steakly is a pretty good writer. He is gritty and pulls no punches. Fans of sci-fi will enjoy this book thoroughly.THE BAD: Nothing comes to mind.THE UGLY: Couldn't find any ugly.Ubermonkey suggests buying this book and reading it on a weekend when there is nothing else to do. You will thank me.
1,HORRIBLE!,"This is one of the WORST books that I have ever read. Everyone compares it to Starship Troopers because it's a pathetic rip-off of that classic novel. Armor ought to be in a comic book somewhere, it's a sad mickey-mouse action book with absolutely no value whatsoever. I DO NOT RECOMMEND Armor in the least. Don't waste your time with this."
1,No Good,"I picked it up hoping for another Starship Troopers or Forever War. It tries to be these books but fails. The universe it is set in is absolutely ludicrous. The character interactions are ridiculous. Even some of the characters' names are laughable.The book opens well enough, with some big battle scenes in powered armor. But these battle scenes drag on forever with nothing meaningful actually happens. The middle of the book is just awful, droning on forever about some character named Jack Crow (guess what, he's a space pirate el oh el).Ultimately, I had to force myself to read as far as I did, hoping it would eventually get better. Alas, it didn't (quite the contrary of getting better actually) and I could not finish this mess. I cannot begin to understand why this book has such high reviews. It's terribly misleading."
1,One of the worst novels I have read,"Pretty bad book.The first part where they are fighting off the aliens was OK, (maybe 2.5 out of 5 stars), but then things took a sharp turn for the worst with the introduction of the second major character.... making the remainder of the book was pretty intolerable."
1,Into the trash,"One of the reviews of this book says to stop reading after page 89. Me, I threw it in the trash before I got that far. Shallow characters, dim-witted dialog. Nothing to draw me in. The only thing I can think that caused my reaction to be so different than the rest of you is that I had just finished reading the first four volumes of Peter Hamilton's Reality Disfunction series. Those books drew me in like nothing has for a long time. By comparison, Armor wasn't even in the same league."
1,You can pass on this one.,"I'm sorry, but I simply cannot share in the praise that others are heaping on this book. The story started out fairly well, but it dropped off the deep end after the first quarter of the book. I just couldn't follow it; I forced myself to read another 50 pages before I gave up & put it away. Sorry, but I was hoping for more."
3,Flawed Masterpiece?,"This book is good. This book is bad. Basically, it splits the story between two characters - a warrior - Felix, and a pirate of sorts, Jack Crow.The sections from Felix's perspective are fantastic and quite, quite brilliant. The sections from Jack Crows perspective are not so good, in my opinion.The problem is that the book begins to concentrate far too much on Mr. Crow than Felix. The ending is somewhat rushed, though it does have an out-there twist. And, as others have mentioned, the book does not give us a set ending for Felix, which is a pity.Because Felix is a wonderful character, and he deserves more 'air-time' than does Mr. Crow. A masterpiece, then. Flawed, but still a masterpiece."
5,not like starship troopers or the forever war...,"This book is not like Starship Troopers or The Forever War.Superficially they all occupy similar settings. And while the forever war may be a post-vietnam answer to the bravado of heinlein's troopers, armor is not limited to that same discourse.steakley explores kafka-like territory in armor. it's more about individual isolation and survival than about the tank-like armor.the emotional content of the story is unlike anything that either heinlein or haldeman explore in their deservedly praised novels.if you read conrad, kafka, and other writers of modern 20th century psychological fiction then you should appreciate steakley. while he might not write with the same flowing oceanic style of conrad, he does write with a gripping militaristic style all his own.don't pass on the experience of armor."
5,Where's the sequel?,John Steakley has to be a pseudonym. It simply is illogical to me that the author has only written two novels (Armor and Vampire$) both absolutely excellent and yet - nothing more.Armor is great the way watching an IMAX movie is great - you feel like you are there. The battles echo images of 'Forever War' and 'Starship Troopers' and yet are ten times more intense.I want a sequel! Actually I'll just be happy if this guy would publish more - not everyone has a flair to write great action sequences for pages on end.
5,A great companion to Starship Troopers and Forever War,"This book is just awesome. I read Starship Troopers, before the movie, and loved it. Then I read Forever War, and loved it. Then I discovered Armor, well the rest is history. I have only one complaint about this book. Where the other two have a conclusive ending for their respective hero, this one doen't, and it is driving me batty. So, basically I am writing this review because of one burning question. Is there going to be a sequal, or not? There deserves to be one. Personally I feel Felix lived, I just want to know what happened after, and to learn more about Felix. These three books, that I have mentioned, make an outstanding trilogy. By three differnt authors, in three different decades. Whether it was intentional, or not. So, Mr. Steakley if you read this, please write a sequal, not a prequal."
3,Bugs again?,"Pretty good book (almost two books -- with two loosely tied plotlines), but it follows in the same vein as Ender's Game and Starship Troopers. It could be a little more original (let's not always use bugs for the bad aliens...). Still, an enjoyable read with good action. (disclaimer: IMHO)"
4,you are what you do when it counts-the Masao,"Steakley's ARMOR is incredible for about 125 pages. Even the beginning of the chapter, Jack Crow, a twist in the book's style, was equally enthralling. There were, however, well written yet tiresome parts of this book...almost a much as to say: About half great action, half great something-or-other. Amazingly enough, everyone i know who has read this book could not put it down, from start to finish. It is well worth reading, in my opinion, because albiet the ""slow"" parts, one should never miss the opportunity, as in (for example) Robinson Caruso, where the plot twists and possibilities physically tingle your mind. Very nearly the last 125 pages were even more pulse pounding than the first; you will fight fatigue to finish ARMOR-i know! -owz"
3,An entertaining read,"I'd like to commend the author for writing a very entertaining book. I, like many other readers, would have preferred more of a story about the military aspects of a war with a poorly understood and sophisticated enemy-told through the personal experience of Felix. I don't think the book would just be a Heinlein copycat. The section on Jack Crow just wasn't that compelling. To construct a plausible, but totally alien world, and to make the story compelling is a challenge I'm not sure the author is up to, given his reliance on raw sex and violence in the Crow chapter to fluff out the book, but I'd encourage him to give it a go. The pair could become a genuine classic."
3,"Merely ""pretty good""",I'm with the couple of other long-time SF readers who rate both Heinlein's Starship Troopers and Joe Haldeman's The Forever War as significantly better.I read Armor back in the '80s when it originally came out. It had a great start but petered out toward the end
5,"INTENSE, cool, FUNNY, sad, AWESOME.","If all you can think of is Starship Troopers when you read this book, you should go back to reading the comics. John Steakley, please give us some Jack Crow novels"
3,"Good, but it didn't knock my socks off...","Yes, the giant ants are scary and the description of hand-to-hand...err...hand-to-pincer combat is excellent, but there are definitely some problems with this book. Namely, the author tells two separate stories (Felix vs. Jack) which are poorly woven together throughout. Then, when the big surprise ending comes and unites both stories, well it's just not very convincing. Also, there are frequent typos, which can get a bit annoying if you mind that sort of thing. Overall, Armor is an entertaining read, but it definitely has a few chinks in it."
2,A half way good book,"In reading all the other reviews that rave about this book, I'm struck by how many people focus on the ""Felix section"". I wonder if people stopped reading when the Jack Crow story started up.The Felix storyline is quite good. The Jack Crow storyline is dull, uninteresting and trite. It strikes me a purely filler to make the book take up more pages. If this book had been edited down to about half it size and exclusively focussed on Felix as a protagonist, it would have been great. The addition of Jack Crow to the book makes it bog down and a bit agonizing to read.Don't be fooled by the glowing reviews, they only cover a third of the book."
5,"God, I love this book!","I have read this book over and over. Though I'm a big Robert Heinlein fan, this book ranks higher in my opinion than most if not all of his books. The main charcter, Felix, is believeable and the situations intense. This is a 'Can't put it down' read even after 20 years. My only complaint, there are only two books available by John Steakley. Where's the next?"
2,Disappointing Heinlein wannabe,"Armor is a somewhat disappointing attemp at a new Starship Troopers. All the basic elements are there, as well as a mysterious hero, but the author is just too cryptic, slow, and disjointed in the way he goes about the plot."
2,A GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT,"This is two different stories tacked together to make a novel. It doesn't work and is a great disappointment because we care about Felix. The center section lacks the power of the first and rings false. The writing in general is only fair, sacrificing as it does, clarity for brevity. Many times the reader is forced to give up trying to figure out what the dialog means and move on. I preferredSisters of Glassto this one for fast moving SF."
2,Overrated - Read Starship Troopers Instead,"This book was recommended to me highly but it turned into a real slog fest. It was a bit predictable, including the ending. The beginning was lifted from Starship Troopers in my opinion. The middle, maybe from Time Enough for Love. Not that there was anything wrong with derivative fiction but it has to be well done."
3,Sucked me in...,"...and spat me out. Many times.It starts well. I enjoyed the description of the strategy and tactics of the armored units. Then it just turns into a long hard slog. By the end I was praying for it to be over.So, like the parson's egg, this book was good in places."
1,The author just didn't understand Starship Troopers.,"The flaws in this book are incredible. In this military, soldiers don't rebel at repeated hopeless missions, (5 survivals makes a trusted hand, 10 a grizzled vetran, and 20 not believed). The officers seem to have no grasp that combat involves killing (possibly of themselves).This military doesn't seem to have any bombs, though a powered armor suit can be made to malfunction and explode like a baby nuke. Too bad that only suits with living occupants seem to have this ability, especially with all the dead troopers laying around at this point in the book.Running out of ammo is common, but nobody ever thinks to take swords, knives, or even a nightstick.The author should have read Starship Troopers a little more closely before writing this book. There was more to Heinlein's book than powered armor.I would have given this book zero stars, but it wasn't an option."
5,Better than Starship Troopers,"Along similar lines as Starship Troopers. This covers the war against ""the bugs"", but has a nice B story to it. You'll get caught up in both stories and very surprised at the end."
3,disapointing,"I read both Starship Troopers and Haldeman's The Forever War, and I enjoyed these books immensely. Both were social, political, and philisphical commentaries. And Armour was recommended as a third book to read if I enjoyed these two. But it wasn't very good. The parts about Felix (1 & 4 i think) and part 5 were excellent, but we could have done without the Jack Crow story. It seemed pointless. I really expected more. And I have no intention of reading the sequal if he writes it. What could have been a great book, was turned into another medioce science fiction novel."
5,A must have book for any reader!,"I first read this book over 10 years ago, and I was entranced by the story. I read it again last week, and was captured by the humanity. I fully expect to find something new when I read it again in 10 years.."
5,Armor: You will read it more than once.,"Armor came out in 1984. Vampire$ in 1990. In 1996, I waited patiently for the next book, and was sorely disappointed that none appeared. Steakley's style is unbelievable, the pace and detail of his stories is second to none. I lent Armor and Vampire$ to a friend in New Mexico, BIG mistake. Never lend these books to anyone whose house you cannot go to and take them back. I have new copies on order, I eventually gave up on getting them back ;)Mr. Steakley, if you ever see this, please inform us all of your writing plans!"
5,Excellent - Fun,"Armor is an excellent book to read. Just sit back and enjoy. Don't try to read into it, just read it and enjoy it. Lots of action, suspence, gore and other fun things. fast paced, slow paced and just the right pace. Don't take it so serious and have fun. Excellent book to read."
3,"Exciting read, but ultimately unfulfilling","Armor was a page turner for me, like one of Tom Clancy's Op-Center books. But, like Op-Center, everything fits too perfectly.Suspension of disbelief only goes so far. When every necessary element shows up (usually with no buildup or warning) at the critical time it is needed, it becomes a fairy tale and not a novel.Once finished it went into the pass-on-to-others stack with the other mind candy I've read."
4,It's not about the battles,"...It's about the people you share the trench with and the invisible wounds that you'll always carry with you.Steakley's classic could not unseat my 2 ~similar genre faves: ""Ender's Game"", and ""The Forever War"", but it's a great story -- both well told, and memorable.""The thing about armor is that it can't protect you from what's inside"""
3,Immature,"I enjoyed this book because the prose is well done and frankly the ending took me by surprise and that is always welcome. I'd say it is immature sci-fi only because it takes a concept and beats the heck out of it and stretches what could have been one chapter into nearly a whole book. Frankly I was tired of hearing about this ""Engine"" and I didn't think the book did justice to the topic of mental and emotional divergence it tried to spend so much time on!By contrast one could read about psychohistory in the Foundation series and really get an education in historical inertia. Armor offered no real insight into the disorder felix was suffering with and I thought in the end it was pretty empty."
5,An action packed epic that will take your breath away!,"This amazing novel is about a man running from his past, and tring to distroy his future. In a far off planet where there is only war, against impossible odds, and amazing foes, he awaits death, but somehow he always mananges to servive. Battle after battle he is the only serviver. What keeps him alive is another personality he has called ""the engine"". This is a fast, intence, easy read, and I loved every word."
4,Great book,"I got this book years ago and must have read it at least four times over the years. The novel unfolds in two phases. The first is about the ""armor"" and is Starship troopers but from a more personal and hectic battlefield view. Great stuff. The second part unfolds more slowly than the first. I think the author tried to bring the story together but the two threads don't work that well together. Regardless, the battlefield is where this book shines. I would highly recommend it."
4,Good cept for the whole Jack Crow part of the story,"Well I like this novel a lot. Well I liked all the parts that told about Felix and the ant war. They were really cool, and I couldn't stop reading. It was full of action, and emotional, and so on. But then they hard the part with Jack Crow bored me to tears. The only reason I kept reading was because there was more of Felix. The endings pretty cool. Don't get me wrong I did like the book, just not the parts with Jack Crow."
1,Boring!!!!,"The first section about Felix was interesting, although kind of boring. The Jack Crow storyline made me trash the book. Maybe it got better after page 200, I wouldn't know and wouldn't care.DON'T BUY OR BORROW THIS BOOK."
1,Stupidest book.Ever.,"If I wanted to read two completely different stories, I would buy two books instead of one or an anthology!"
5,A work of art,"This book is truely a classic. It is what every military Sci-fi novel should be judged by. This book kept me interested till the end, with the constant question of what happens to Felix? I have read ""Starship Troopers"" (which I found a very good book)yet it is often a commentary on the proper mindset of a soldier in war. ARMOR is the story of a solider in war the ups, the downs, and the hell he must indure as long as he remains alive. I believe this book is great because it tells not a story of war, but the story of a man. A man who although he won't admit it wants to die, but with honor because his love is dead. This is a great story, one I wish had a sequel."
2,"The first 89 pages are great, stop reading after then.","A lot of people reviewed this book with a comparison to Starship Troopers. I wonder if these folk read on to page 90-412 where the story bogs down into a morass of unremarkable, uninteresting writing. I found myself skipping several pages only to pick up the story without difficulty later on. It's almost as if this started as a short story then was expanded to a book at some publisher's request. This book seems to have only a quick flash of greatness that quickly disappears into predictable, stick with great books like the Forever War, Starship Troopers and the Hammer's Slammer's early series, they're great books that I read over and over. Get this one from your local library, read the first 89 pages then the last 2 chapters, that'll give you the best reading experience."
3,"A good read, ... but.....","I enjoyed this book, but I have to say I liked Starship Troopers better (which this is similar to and is always compared to). I liked the details of the emotions, the training, and the high-tech stuff, but I didn't feel very attached to the main character. Also, the whole Jack Crow section kind of threw me for a loop (why did it take so long to get to the point? - Plus it was weird having the same character names from Vampire$). It was interesting enough that I did want to keep reading it to find out how it would end, but after reading the other reviews and how most were absolutely gushing over it, I guess when all is said and done I did feel a little let down."
5,great sci-fi suspense,"Loved the book. Does anyone know if Armor was printed in hardback? If so, how do I retrieve one?"
5,The Best of Our Best,"Ive read this book about 3 times and keep picking it up. I would suggest it to well...anyone really. Military, Scifi, and just people who admire good work. The plot is intriging and personaly id like to see a prequal and a sequal. There is so much we dont know about Felix like what his first name is, G? He made around 20 drops and we only see a tenth of those. Who is Jack Crow? How did he get to the Lyndril prison in the first place? And the Ants attack on central america is never really explained. And what about the armored olympics how does the war end? Theres so much information in the book and so much you just want to know. Thats what makes a greak novel, when you want more because the rest was fantastic!"
2,Reply to guy from Texas,"This is just a reply to the guy from Texas. First off, Starship Troopers was published in 1959, Armor was published in 1984. Now, tell me, which one inspired which?"
2,"A ""Military Classic""? I wonder...","This book reminded me of a high school writing assignment. Great beginning, bad middle, worse ending. I haven't yet decided if its an homage to Starship Troopers, or a blatant rip-off. The beginning of the book, which details the intial combat drop and Felix's (the main character) attempt to survive, are the best parts of the entire read. The action sequences are fast paced and believeable, and the psychological changes in Felix are frightenly real.The middle/end has parts in it that are so boring, its an act of self-discipline to finish them. Several times I had to force myself to continue reading, hoping in vain that something would happen. Unfortunately, nothing ever did. If this book is a ""classic"", its a classic in disappointment only."
5,i loved this book read it over and over again,one of my favorite books thought it was well written and kept my interest the first reading couldn't put it down right a sequel john
2,You have got to be kidding,"""Armor"" is at best a non-thinking shootemup with the not-so-good good guy and the really bad mindless and countless aliens. The ""Ants"" are a huge rip-off. As a matter of fact, this whole book is a huge rip-off. I realize that in the limited scope of humans vs. aliens genre it may be difficult to come up with something new, but thats why these guys get paid the big bucks. Anyone who thinks that this book is better than ""Starship Troopers"" or ""The Forever War"" has been hooked up to their suit for too long. Steakley does develope one brilliant character, and should do a short story anthology of the legends of Jack Crowe"
2,What is all the fuss?,"The description of combat in the beginning was a real hook. However, the Jack Crow section was like a completely different story thrown in to confuse me. The Felix story stops and then you have to play catch up for the last few pages. Forever War, for example, is a far more disciplined and structured narrative showing the effects of combat on individuals than this book. I was disappointed in ARMOR"
2,Extremely too far-fetched for even a science-fiction novel.,"This book lacked the realty of ""Starship Troopers"" and ""The Forever War"". It was recommended to me because it was ""supposed"" to be like ST and FW, but it was very dissapointing. I mean, how could Felix and his comrades kill so much ants in so little time with just the butts of thier blazers, and the whole Jack Crow story was completely unnecessary, but, I must admit, it did have a very good ending and a very good set-up for a sequel."
2,"Good Beginning, ok ending, TERRIBLE middle","I'm kind of shocked by the number of 5 star reviews of this book. It really does get you into the action of fighting a war in the first section of the book. It's gripping, it's engaging, you want more!So Steakley throws you in with space pirates! on a back water planet for a few hundred pages. Let me tell you, you don't care about ANY of these characters. You just want to suffer through them to get back to the war stuff.So you slog through the stuff about murdering a puppy, and you get to the war stuff, and, it's pretty good. Rather predictable, but good.I bought it for a $1.06 at Goodwill. I don't feel I was ripped off, but I'm selling it at my next garage sale."
2,It's a TV book,"This is a story set in the future about a soldier and his experiences fighting an insurmountable alien force; you're thinking ""so what, almost all sci-fi novels are like that."" So what makes the book special? Nothing, really.It's a rather dull book with no big twists that I bought completely off the reccommendations of others. Even Steakley's command of the English language is a little shaky throughout the book. Our protagonist, Felix, is a bit of a weird one and I had a hard time identifying with his character; and when that happens, it suddenly becomes a very hard novel to finish.This novel is good for nothing more than passing time; a ""TV book"" if you will. If I had the choice to read Ringworld (L Niven) for the 10th time, or this book for the first, I would go with the former."
2,Where's the beef?,"Sorry guys but this is a dog. I had to throw it away after a100 pages. No plot, no character development, nothing to grab andhold your attention."
4,Great read,"I have read this book three times, and each tome the book gets better and better. When Felix is in combat, I feel that I am right there with him, maybe looking for a stray ant myself. the Jack Crow portions of the book fit very well with the overall plot as it gives a good contrast as to what happened and what is now hapening. The ending was great as everything seemed to meld together as if it was a sort of destiny that Felix made it through the ant wars to save the system at a later time. I highly recommend this novel for anyone who likes SF"
4,Beefy,"I can not give these a 5 star review because I did not actually use them. They are very substantial and I do not have a crimping tool. Usually I just pound these type of terminations with a hammer and a screw driver, but don't think that would work with these."
5,highly recommended,"By far the best deal on here, if you're looking for a long sleeve T. Awesome quality. An all-around great buy."
3,Fruit of the Loom Men's Long Sleeve Crewneck,Pretty good shirt to use for layering. The shirt is not made of the thickest or softest cotton but still a good shirt. Very good value at the price i paid.
3,VERY Lightweight...,"Suited more for the tropics than seasonal Wisconsin, this 100% Cotton Tee is EXTREMELY THIN AND LIGHTWEIGHT. Not pre-shrunk so buy a size UP as the Mens Medium we purchased now fit a Pomeranian dog after washing & drying per instructions. Seriously: this Tee shrunk, but has maintained well over daily use and numerous laundry days. This is not a top-quality shirt that you'd find at the Gap, but just a rather average undershirt. Redeeming quality: best used as a first layer undershirt. We purchased two 3 Packs; and suggest FOTL offer us a medium-to-heavy weight version of this Tee. Let's face it - the price was right!"
1,Let's Not Celebrate the Decline of Business Ethics,"Not a very informative book, it's also a pretty depressing one.One wonders who is being digged at between the pages.Not reccomended."
2,Save your money...,Although the colors are vivid the gemoetry is poor and text is slightly blurred at all resolutions. The monitor has an obvious sag or bow at the top of the screen. Horizontal text displays lower in the middle of the screen than on either side. Neither vertical grid lines of spreadsheets nor menus display truly vertically. I have tried for over one week to correct the flaw through the adjustments. Note that the HP p930 and Compaq P930 are branded versions of the same monitor (according to customer people).
1,Terrible light spread,This product is absolutely aweful. It barely lights up a few lines of text and it feels really cheap.
3,If God wanted us to travel,I was disappointed in this book and am sorry to say that since I have been a David Brenner fan for years.
2,poor quality,"this thing is totally crap, cheap, cheap, cheap, would not recommend. inserts will not fit shifter correctly and product is made out of some unknown chrome plated plastic sort of material, can not identify"
5,This grid is essential!,"I wanted a stainless sink grid made especially for the dimensions of the Elkay sink I purchased, and this fits perfectly and looks great -- it actually enhances the look of the sink, and works even better than I thought! Especially since I have not been a fan of stainless steel sinks and how ugly and old they look after a short time what with the scratches and dullness that happens to them. This is gleaming, easy to clean, and keeps everything off the bottom surface of the sink. Worth the price."
1,stinks,movie was only 15 minutes long.a review of this movie should have been given before putting it up for sale.
2,Death Ranch R.I.P.,"This video is a plotless pointless waste of time. At 18 minutes, it's too long for a ""short"" and without enough content for a longer format. Its opening mood promises a thriller, then it ends. Sort of a humorless shaggy dog joke. Just a dog."
2,A band that needs erasure,"I remember the conflicts between the fans of Depeche Mode and the fans of Erasure about which band was the best.The answer is tantalizingly simple. None of them were. They were both crap.Weirdly, both bands were created by the same person, Vince Clark. But then, Mr. Clark also formed two good bands, Yazoo (Yaz) and The Assembly.Thank goodness.As for Depeche Mode, their beat was recently pilfered by Lady Gaga. They used to be so famous. Now, their music is used as background by a crazy trannie doing euro-disco. Fitting punishment!PS. On balance, I think Erasure was better."
4,I love me some Depeche Mode,"There are a lot of great songs on here. I'm not a huge fan of the earliest Depeche Mode, and I only like a few of their newer singles. For me, Violator is the pinnacle of their music. This is a good collection to have if you want a few of the singles from their music collection without owning the entire albums."
3,Great collection BUT not the best of Depeche Mode,"I love Depeche Mode. I will always be a fan of their music but I have to say that I'm disappointed in this ""Best of"" compilation. That's why I'm giving it 3 out 5 stars. If this is a ""Best Of""...where is ""Nothing"" where is ""Blue Dress""???? Who put this compilation together? As a true fan, I can think of a whole list of better songs to replace some of the ones put on this compilation. Just because a song had radio play doesn't necessarily make it ""Best of"" quality. Those are the songs I'm tired of hearing to be honest. You can do better than this. Seriously.~"
3,For the newbie.,"I'll compare this to The Cure's greatest hits: good, but just the basics. I'm not even the biggest DM fan and I could add another 15 songs to this collection easy. So I called this pretty much for the new fan or the completist. More worthy if you get the version with the DVD of course. Still great songs no doubt, but like others have mentioned the non-chronological order is jolting at times. If the songs you're wanting are here, perfect. If not, get one or both of the singles collections. Or wait...I'm sure a 2-disc Very Best is just a matter of time."
5,"Great CD,","Pretty much every song on this album is well-done and easy to listen to. My favorites are ""Just can't get enough"" (a great song from the 80s) and ""Enjoy the Silence.""Their music is quite distinct and I listen to them always on long driving trips. This group really knows how to play.Anyone who is in their 30s to 40s range will most likely enjoy listening to this. However, I think anyone anyone at almost any age might like this CD."
2,Doesn't DM have enough of our money?,"I'm not sure when it started, but in the day when DM released an album they came out with ONE single and they had a limited amount of ""best of"" albums. Now they have twenty throw away remixes of one song and put it on two cd at a premium price. And best of cds like this are worthless. I bought it taking a chance. Sure the new song is worth a listen, but I believe that the band lowers themselves with every best of series. I mean, who is going to buy this? Don't they have enough of my money after 25 years?They again, this might not have been the bands idea.Sorry to be so negative."
2,Check the DVD region,"Make sure you check the DVD region on this item. I recently purchased this product but found out after it arrived that the DVD is for the PAL format which is used mainly in Eurpoe and not the US. The CD is fine, but we can't play the DVD."
3,A glimpse of madness through rose colored lenses.,"Tedious reading, grown more so due to the fact that time has made so many names, events, and places quite irrelevant; however, still one of the best looks into the unreality of a world seen through the eyes of National Socialism's number one sycophant. What is astounding is that skipping ahead to another book with the last of the diaries, one finds the author still in an ""Alice in Wonderland"" world of seeing some purpose relativity of the utter and total collapse of the Nazi construct."
4,Not bad at all!,I did this workout with a 10-pound kettlebell and it was great. I would give it 5 stars if the ab section was just a little longer. But for a 30-minute workout this was nicely intense.
1,Terrible Workout,"This is my 1st time ordering a FIRM product, and I was happy that the workout is only 30 minutes long. I was very disappointed with the DVD, the instructor is going so fast with the warm up, the cues are awful. But when she gets to the workout she slows down. I sent this back because I knew I could not do this workout."
3,Firm Sculpting Ball Review,"I am a BIG Firm Fan. I have been using their videos and DVDs for approximately 10 years. I had high hopes for this workout, as I was looking for something different from the tradional Firm step format. Unfortunately I have to report that I was disappointed. When I did the workout, I did break a sweat. Unfortunately I just couldn't get into it and found myself looking at the display counter to see how much longer till the workout was over. It is conventient when I go away as the only pieces of equipment I need to bring are the ball and DVD. But aside from when I travel, the DVD does little more than collect dust on my shelf."
1,OW!,"I bought this from a different vendor and started working out with it immediately, interspersing it with my usual cardio workouts. I usually lift weights, have no prior injuries, and consider myself in pretty good shape as well as pretty used to working out and using proper form (I played a college sport, etc.). After a couple days of using this product my neck and shoulders started spasming and were so stiff that I could barely move them regularly. It was clearly not from the amount of weight since i am used to using much heavier (free weights included). Perhaps I was doing the exercises incorrectly, but that seems like a real risk with a video like this."
2,I don't think so...,"I was required to read this book for a class on the history of the modern Middle East. I thought this would be one of the more interesting textbooks that I have to read this semester. I was wrong; this thing is painful.I've been informed by a friend of mine from the area that it probably loses something in the transition from Arabic to English, but to me the whole thing is overwritten, self centered and features the ""heroine"" blaming her problems largely on society. Of course she does go into detail about that society, providing the historical value, but still. In places it reads like a manuscript rejected from Harlequin Romance Novels.If you really want a picture of life in the Middle East. read ""Struggle and Survival in the Modern Middle East"" by Edmund Burke. Gives a better pictue."
2,Pieces are TINY!,"My son loves the book. However the puzzles bother him. The pieces are tiny...much smaller than other puzzles in this age category. Although they are durable, I would recommend the company making them bigger so they don't get lost. This seems very pricey for a paperback book and 3 mini puzzles."
4,A Fine Selection,"Robert Bly offers a fine collection of William Stafford's work. Bly's affection and respect for Stafford shines in the introduction, which offers insights that will help many readers more fully access Stafford's work. For me, the poems themselves radiate the power and strength of gentleness and simplicity. As Stafford writes in ""By a River in the Osage Country: "" You don't need many words if you already know what you're talking about."" The selection is rich with Staffords imaginal reflections on family, his children, his parents, and the simple mysteries of the world. These are poems of moral intelligence expressed with great integrity. This is what we mean when we say a person is ""grounded."" The volume concludes with the classic ""A Ritual to Read to Each Other,"" a stirring affirmation of courage and authenticity - a touchstone in an age of denial and fearful people lying to each other."
4,american francophile,This is a great album to have if you are a French teacher or professor in the states. It has jazzy tunes and the words are easy to understand and break out for teaching purposes.
4,hail thunes,"i most say that i don't agree with the review above.i see the thunes interview as the strongest by far of the four, and this book turned me on to a lot of the music he has played on. requiem for heavyweight is in my book one the best musician interviews ever."
3,A decent text,"While the text book is informative and enlightening on many of the aspects of World Music, it is frustrating that he continually puts out newer editions that have minimal changes except for the CD. For the general information gathered from this text, anyone will be able to gain loads of interesting facts about the different cultures and their musical ceremonies/practices."
3,Make sure to get the CD's in the deal,"Bought the book new but didn't realize that the CD's are sold separate, look for a used book deal that has them included if you are going to need them!!"
3,Unclear what is included,"Frustrated that we had to buy the book and CDs separately. It was clear from the description that the book purchase does not include the CDs, but what is not as clear is that the ""CD Set"" is not the inclusive book and CDs set, it is just the CDs. We bought the CD set and then had to come back later and buy the book when we realized that they were entirely separate. So, we did not have the book on time for class. Kinda irritating."
1,Book gets the job done.,The book had a lot of tears but the content is all there and it gets the job done. I love that it came with the CD's.
4,Simple,I like this author. She writes simply and straight forward. I don't have to run to the dictionary because she is testing my word skills or flowery filler. She tells a story and I am interested from start to finish.
5,We are never alone.,"Carol Denego's first book is filled with charming personal vignettes about one woman's encounter with the vicissitudes of life, those events that fill our own storybooks with memorable moments of joy and sorrow, challenge and triumph. It is a friendly and honest book, guileless and funny in a way that touches us all no matter who we are or where we're from. Her message is deceptively simple: We are never alone, and life unfolds in perfection if we but do the journey. There is sweetness and magic in her stories, and they ring with the truth of everyday reality."
5,The High Road of Faith: A Personal Journey by Carol J Denego,"An inspirational book. You feel as though you have got under Carol's skin to be able to laugh and weep with her. At time's in your life when you need inspiration, this will be the book to pick up to make you realize you are not facing the world alone."
5,A different take on Mr. Weidlick's book... Rebuttal to Mr. Thieblot,"As an amateur musician and musical history enthusiast, I must say that Mr. Weidlick's book is a fascinating, ADVANCED look at the banjo's musical past... I think the reviewer, Mr. Thiebolt, has some built-in assumptions of his own about the book which do not necessarily reflect the reality of what the book really is.I do not see anywhere where the author claims that this work is an instruction book or primer for Banjo 101. It's seems pretty obvious that this is a detailed historical view of specific banjo work of the time, and clearly it is an ADVANCED LOOK at the strumming of the time. It's also painfully obvious that Mr. Thiebolt just doesn't get it- either musically or literarily, which in his own review he admits is beyond his comprehension.For real banjo players who know music, this is an interesting in-depth piece of banjo history, and a good how-to on replicating some of the licks of that era... CJ,III"
4,Addicting,"Hell's Kitchen is just simply addictive for my family and me. We cannot get enough. We have watched every season except two, and will watch that one soon. The only reason I'm giving four stars instead of five is that the DVD's menu navigation is terrible with each season we have ordered. It is so difficult to navigate from one episode to the next and within each episode. This makes the viewing experience a frustrating one. I hope that future DVD season releases will have much better menu navigation."
3,Great Show - Bad DVD,"This is one of the better seasons of Hell's Kitchen, but there's a big problem with this DVD set. The season was broadcast in 16:9, yet this DVD is 4:3. WHY?? I don't think they even cut it to 4:3 properly, because the aspect ratio still looks slightly off.If you can live with the weird picture, you'll enjoy this season."
3,"Easy, Easy...","This is not a complicated score. The music is simple to play, the vocal lines are easy to sing. For women there are a few power ballads, even a sensitve number or two for women. However, there is virtually no material at all for men, so be warned."
3,Roy's values and sensitivities shines,"In her newest offering Arudhati Roy , the writter of the widely known and multi-awarded The God Of Small Things presents a deep , careful study on the impact "" progress "" has made on the life of thousands of people in her country . She describes an India with many cultural and racial entities where the goverment keeps building huge dams in the valley of Naramada with no certain strategy and essential reasons . What she seems to be asking is this : "" even if these dams are useful , does it eventually worth sacrificing so many people's lifes and houses for them ? "" . In the end the book wins the reader not so much because of Roy's writing style but thanks to the power of her own personallity . She's a young , beutiful and wealthy woman who never forgets though the poor part of her country's population . Instead , she keeps standing by them with her writtings and her actions ."
5,Good quality,"I believe I ordered mine as a used but it's great quality and doesn't have any marks inside, which I appreciate."
1,This book adds to your cost of living,For $11.99 it is an expensive ebook for $4.99 it would have been affordable. I am saying this as someone who read it and feel not have got the money's worth. There is little in it that cannot be ascertained from reading her other Book 'Walking with the Comrades'. That book is well written and more fact rich all be it the facts in her book are not likely to be independently verified. I wonder why she sticks to narratives which are full of Rhetoric and facts that are difficult to verify. But I suppose facts that cannot be independently verified is better than having no facts at all. In any case this book is not rich on facts about the events that are written about. And besides not everyone is interested in facts.
5,roy strikes again,"Arundhati Roy is more or less guaranteed to hit below the belt. For an American reader, she is also guaranteed to teach you something you probably knew little about. She invariably does so in a marvelous fashion; her prose is unmatched. If you enjoyed her work of fiction, The God of Small Things, I encourage you to try her non-fiction works.This book focuses on the dams on India; it's a passionate argument against damming and in favor of considering people, all the poor people of India.Roy also discusses India's testing of the atomic bomb, another topic which most Americans probably haven't spent a great deal of time considering. Roy is convincing and writes from the heart in a way very few politicians or politicists do."
4,Good Book,"This is a good book for college anatomy and physiology. It is very thorough and descriptive. Goes in depth into nervous, muscular, skeletal and endocrine systems to name a few. I also recommend Key Facts of Anatomy and Physiology isbn;0971999694. This last book shows you what's important to study for. Both books highly recommended."
5,Martini is the answer!,"Martini is the answer! No matter who you are, if you're studying the human body- Martini is your new best friend. I ran across Martini in Chiropractic school per a professor's recommendation. From then on it was just short of a love affair with Dr. Martini (or his work at least). Unbelievably well laid out and basically thorough. Bravo Dr. Martini! It is a miracle work if you want to read it to gain a SOLID foundation before you attempt more advanced (both) anatomy AND physiology courses and books. Bravo Bravo Bravo!"
5,Thank You,I want to thank Amazon and the seller for being able to pass along a savings to a college student. The cost of higher education can really be taxing and companies and big-hearted people like the seller really help the students struggling to meet the requirements used in furthering their education.Thank you very much. A Student
5,Simplistic and Thorough,I am a graduate student and I have to take boards. I have to take boards on all the undergraduate information that I forgot. I found this book to refresh and teach me every thing that I need to be successful. This book is not too wordy and uses a lot of diagrams for easy understanding. The price was also great.
4,A & P book review,Book is in pretty good condition with slightly bent edges as is nearly every used book. The spin is not damaged and all of the pages are intact. Nothing is highlighted in the book.
1,Virulent Anti-Gay and Homophobic,"I was gifted with this book and after 20 pages I could not take it anymore. I love and respect the person that gave it to me...but it insulted my intelligence so much that I finally just put it in the heap (where it belongs).It is totally UN-informative on raising a young man in today's world, and instead filled with Dobson's perverse and vitriolic disgust with anyone who is a not a squeaky clean Christian (which of course we know Dobson must be!!!) It's basically a gay-bashing and/or single parenting-bashing treatise.Stay away from the fire and brimstone and seek out some real, intelligent dialogue on being a father, dad, mentor to today's young men."
2,Dr. Dobson has never met my daughter!,It seems like people look for generalities and stereotypes to compare themselves or their children to to convince themselves that they (or their children) are OK. So many qualities that Dr. Dobson reserves for boys are qualities that my daughter has; and she is Really Neat. I would be disappointed (and probably a little angry) if someone looked at my daughters qualifications for a leadership position and chose an equally qualified boy (just because he is a boy) so it wouldn't hurt his ego. What about her ego? We shouldn't limit our boys' potential but we shouldn't limit our girls' potential either!
2,This would be a good book for the 1950's,"This book was recommended to me by a friend and I thought I would enjoy reading it. There was some insightful information, but I actually found most of it downright offensive. If you're a single mom, this book will make you want to cry because according to Dobson, you're not likely to be able to teach your son to be a man. If you're homosexual, you can be ""fixed."" If you don't have at least a father figure, you're going to end up in jail. If you get your hands on any kind of porn when your an adolescent, you're going to end up obsessed with it later on in life. I could go on and on. I am a Christian and I'm not a feminist, but Dr. Dobson's views are stuck in a time-warp."
1,Not really about how to raise young men,"While I don't disagree with Dr. Dobson on a few of his societal observations; however, referring to homosexuality as a ""disorder""is not supported by current research. His fear-mongering diatribes are clearly out of place and irrelevant to the subject as defined by the title. I found certain of his views so off-track and polarizing that it distracted me from the premise of the book. If Dr. Dobson wants to rant and rave on his biblical and conservative view that being Christian means being intolerant and inflexible, that's fine, but then he should look in the mirror and start by being honest with the name of his own book and call it: ""How the Religious Conservative Raises Sons to Act and Think""."
5,Bringing Up Boys,"This is an excellent resource for parents and guardians of boys. Dr. Dobson brings years of experience into this book. He is highly repected in his field. I owned a copy while raising my older son and then passed it on. After adopting another boy, I knew I needed this reference. If you are looking for a Godly perspective on raising boys, this is one of the best. I love it!"
4,Insight,"I have started to read this book. I have a nine year old son. This book has really given me some insight into his world. Although I am not yet done reading this book, I feel any parent who has a son should raed this book. Before I read the book I had some issues that I was just not sure I could make a clear opinion on, but now I feel more sure of my stand on certain issues and I understand a little better of why my son does certain things. He is a smart little boy - sometimes too smart for his own good. I feel closer to him after reading this book."
5,Just What the Doctor Ordered....,"This is a ""must-have"" book for any parent of any aged son. The book is packed with practical advice for raising a well rounded, secure boy in today's confusing world. Doctor Dobson backs his advice up with solid research and studies which are footnoted throughout. I will be using this a guide while raising my son. I would recommend to anyone with a son, grandson, or stepson."
1,nuts to this,"this is mysogonist drivel. he mistakes how men (read: him and his father) have been socialized in our toxic north-american culture for the true nature of man. hogwash. no, worse. damaging to children. stay clear. -cheri, mother, teacher, 20+ years of childcare."
5,Must read for any parent raising a boy/s,A must read for raising boys. Dr. Dobson made so many things clear and truly helped in raising my son by helping to really understanding him. Knowing the reasons behind things really helps in guiding them as they grow.
4,A valuable parenting resource,"As a new dad, I found this book to be an extremely helpful resource. Dobson covers numerous relevant topics and provides fresh, practical ideas. I will certainly be coming back to this book over the ensuing years as my son grows. Highly recommended for dads, moms and grandparents."
2,"Full of polemics and societal lament, almost bereft of practical advice","Dr. Dobson has grossly mis-subtitled this volume: It should have been called, ""Bringing Up Boys: What's wrong with contemporary American society and how it threatens the well-being of your sons."" His book contains chapter after tiresome chapter of him warning and/or inveighing against a parade of societal ills, cherry-picking sound bytes from popular news media up to thirty years old to make his points, and offering very little practical advice or encouragement for parents. An almost worthless read.Please note that I write this as a conservative, born-again Christian."
2,"Lots of problems, not many solutions","Altho I've really enjoyed some of Dr. Dobson's books, this was a disappointment to both my husband and I. It seemed to touch on many discouraging scenarios hitting our sons in this day & age; from a lack of male scholastic incentives in public school, to softening the leadership traits in our sons, to sexual predators--but not very many solutions to combat the problems."
2,Title Misleading,"Certainly Dr. Dobson has done much good work in promoting the pro-family agenda. The problem with this book is that it does not directly address the responsibility of raising boys. Make no mistake, boys and girls are different and Dobson does a good job of pointing out this difference. But if you want to read about the research concerning the difference between the sexes, and the cultural assault on boys, then you are much better off consulting ""The War Against Boys"" by Sommers.There are indeed, numerous funny stories and pointed anecdotes mixed with helpful insight and advice in this book. But if you are a Christian looking for consistent Biblical wisdom to help you raise a boy into a man you can do no better than ""Future Men"", by Douglas Wilson. Wilson's book is so solidly Biblical that it will expose to many ""Bible believing Christians"" just how far from Biblical thinking most American Christians are. While Dobson wants us raise ""good boys"", Wilson tells us how to grow men."
2,Too faith-based oriented for me,"based on some good reviews I figured I'd give this a whirl, but even as a Christian I found he comes across to much as a pastor delivering a sermon.There is also considerable fluff and I ended up skimming it. Unless you're a pretty hard core Christian and enjoy being preached too, I'd suggest you read the excellent Raising Boys instead."
5,a Must to Read,"This book is excellent. For anyone raising a boy, it really is a must to read. I was raised in a family of four girls and had no former experience with little boys. When my son finally came along, I was confused and frustrated at times with how to handle all of the challenges that come with a little boy. It is fun and wonderful but also VERY different from raising girls. One might not think a husband, who used to be a little boy, would struggle with the decisions and frustrations of raising a boy, but he has. We are reading this book together and it is clearing things up as to why young males act the way they do, how to handle it, and what to expect even further down the road."
2,I expected more................................,"I am about halfway through this book and really can't decide if I want to continue. I'm a single mom raising my 2 year old son. While I know my situation is not ideal, it sure is better than what it would have been if I stayed in my marraige. Dr. Dobson offers lots of facts but no solutions. I was looking forward to reading this book to help me guide my son but find myself just feeling like no matter how good of a job I do, he is doomed to fail because he is not in a traditional family."
2,not for me...,"I am a soon-to-be father and I was really looking for a book that addressed the unique father-son relationship and its specific needs.To be fair, this book does spend some time addressing how little boys are generally different from little girls, and thus how the parenting approach needs to be somewhat different.However, I felt an unwieldy portion of this book was spent denigrating feminists, homosexuals, the media and single parents and people who do not fit into the white-picket-fence-suburban-perfection-ideal of America.I don't care about any of the author's views of any of those things; I just want to learn about good father-son parenting.People who share Dr Dobson's convictions will probably need to put the book down repeatedly to applaud. For people looking for substantive parental guidance, there's just too much flotsam to wade through..."
1,The Bible Tells You So,"I bought this book because I have a 15 year old son. After I began reading it I realized that Dobson had a specific religious agenda. This book is a training manual for fundamentalist right wing Christians on how to apply literalist Bible teachings to bringing up young boys. It ignores years of scientific findings and common sense. If you are a fundamentalist Christian you'll find this book reinforcing to your already accepted beliefs, otherwise this is a deceptive and misinformed book."
1,Yikes. The Man Is A Walking Christian Stereotype,"Eeek. It's a real shame that a book like this has actually been published and put on the market and advertised as 'practical.' There are lots of words I'd use to describe this book and it's author, so called 'Dr.' James Dobson, but 'practical' is not one of them. Some words I would use would include: 'bigoted,' 'homophobic,' 'insane,' 'illogical,' 'silly,''sexist,' 'Nazi-ish,' and 'stupid.' Yeah, just plain stupid. If you're seriously thinking about purchasing this book, I advise you to travel to the book store and flip to chapter nine, 'The Origins of Homosexuality.' Now this chapter is just insane. It's books and people like this who give Christians a bad name."
1,very troubling,"I find Dr. Dobson's viewpoints extremely troubling. In my opinion, he does a disservice to families and children through his biased opinions. This is not a book that supports the values of love and acceptance."
1,Bringing up boys,"I hoped to read this book and gain a better understanding of the emotional needs of raising a son. What I received was highly offensive material that probably had a place in our moralistic views over 50 years ago, but do not apply in today's age.While I understand that books are strictly opionions expressed on paper, I thought that I might find a more useful tool from this gentleman who holds a Ph.D. I am a mother and I found myself gasping several times during this book - I just could not believe that he had the audacity to write some of these idiacies. To papraphrase one quote, ""boys should not act goofy. Woman will not follow a male who displays this characteristic"".In closing, I highly sympathize with Dr. Dobson's wife and daughter. I cannot imagine living with someone who has such a narrow perspective. He should not claim to be an expert on the subject of child-rearing."
3,disappointed,"I was a single mother of a boy for seven year. I have remarried, have a two year old boy and another boy on the way so I was very excited to have this book. As much as I appreciate the insight as to how boys are ""wired"" differently from girl, I can't help but feel that Dr. Dobson looks on mothers as ""hosts"" for sons and once they hit 18 months, we are supposed to step back. I am feeling now like any interaction I have with my younger sons can almost be harmful to their ""manhood."" I also COMPLETELY disagree with the homosexuality chapter. There is a big difference between a ""cure"" and ""denial."" I was hoping for advice, but instead, I feel like I damaged my older son and am in danger of doing the same to my younger ones."
1,Book was misnamed,"It should have been called ""Bringing Up Homophobes"". I am a Christian and received this from my Christiam MIL upon the birth of my first son. I have never been so disgusted by a book in my life and finally understood the desire to burn a book. I can't even give it away for free because I don't want anyone else to fill their minds with this tripe."
1,Ok maybe just one more star...,"For the sheer absurd humor in this book!! It's hilarious...you read it and you think, geez, people don't really believe this guy, do they? I guess it takes all kinds.When he really get's going in some later chapters, it is reminiscent of Koresch or Jones.....hmmmmm can you spell fanatical cult, little Bobby? Then do I have a book for you...."
1,the 'dr' hates women,"I listen to Dr.Dobson's radio program just to see what othernonsense he might be dishing out to the public.I read thebook and it portrays boys as these strange creatures not atall like girls in any behavior.In real life we haveoverlaping of behavior,not boys one way and girls theother.How can one help a boy if all the discriptions ofthe boys in this book are sterotypical.All boys do notexhibit the same behaviors.Furthermore,the book is insulting to single moms,which areviewed as inept to raise a boy.My older sister raised herson entirely on her own and he didn't join a gang orbecome a dope addict!Us women aren't so stupid as to notbe able to raise a boy.The problem is Dr.Dobson doesn'twant boys to have human characteristics,he wants them to havecharacteristics of dominating and smothering women withcontroll.Seems he thinks this is the only indication of a manbeing a 'real man'.A real man is a human being,not a bullywho plays a manly game of domination over the world and women!"
1,"a truly ""God"" awful mess","BE warned. It is a weel known fact among Evangelical circles that items like this get reviewed by follower without them actually buying or reading the book. I have received many requests in the mail asking me to do so for various books, tapes, cds, etc. On to the review from someone who wasted $$$ and bought it.Save your money and buy a bunch of planks to hit your children and duct tape to make sure they don't hear or see what you don't want them to. Don't parent out of love. Parent with fear. Before buying this book do some research on the author. What his views are on every imaginable topic. What he is a ""dr."" of. Then make your decision.Being a christian myself, I can't fathom anyone using this book as a guideline to raising children and STILL expecting to be right with their God.It only gets 1 star because I could'nt give it zero."
1,Terrible,"Complete waste of time. What can i tell about the author who thinks that homosexuality is a desease?? He also believes that it can be cured!!!! If the author had been gay he would've known better. What about tha people who have gay sons??? I tink that this book is completely outdated and reminds me in many places the books of the beginning of the century. A lot of religious stuff and no information. The next thing such authors would like to advise you to do is to put some kind of device to prevent the teenaged boys from masturbation like in 19-th century books. Well, in 2 words - back to 19 th century."
2,Mistitled...,"I read 'Bringing Up Boys' in the hopes of finding, as the subtitle promises, ""practical advice and encouragement"" for raising my son to be a man of purpose and character. While there certainly are nuggets of practical wisdom scattered throughout, 'Bringing Up Boys' seems to be more of a platform for Dr. Dobson to share his views on gender-related issues in society than a means to provide guidance to parents on specific boy-oriented parenting issues.While I don't necessarily disagree with Dr. Dobson on SOME of his societal observations, many seemed out of place and irrelevant to the subject as defined by the title. I found certain of his views so off-track as to distracted me from the premise of the book.Still, Dr. Dobson seemed to emphasize clearly throughout that our children need to be a priority during the season of their growing up years, and this is certainly a worthy message."
3,if you have no other resource....,"I read this about 5 years ago (or so). I have 5 kids- 2 boys and I run a boys club at our kids school (club is for boys ages 5-15).This book lacks a lot. It's really just poorly named. It should be entitled, ""Being a parent in today's world,"" or something like that.I can't say what other book I would recommend, but I'll just say that this book didn't offer much real substance on HOW to bring up boys.How do you deal with boys of different temperments? How do you teach different virtues to boys (diligence, purity, courage, etc.)? What should you do as a Mom? or as a Dad? What is different about raising 5 year olds from 15 year olds?This book really just makes the case for WHY you need to be a good parent.I enjoy Dr. Dobson- and I used to listen to him religiously. The only reason I stopped was because I discovered talk radio.But despite the respect I have for Dr. Dobson, I don't recommend this book."
1,Very disappointed,"I am about to adopt 2 boys and a neighbor said that I just HAD to read this book. I have been reading a number of books that have given clear and positive advice and opinions, this book was not one of those books. I sat down with my highlighter ready to mark interesting passages and quickly realized that there were none. I feel that this book is more about the author's views on the state of the ""traditional"" family, feminism and homosexuality than the unique challenges of raising a boy."
1,Ugh,"Bringing Up Boys is a book that contains very little parenting advice but an abundance of ""the world is a terrible scary place now, not like when I was growing up"" type of writing. I am a Christian man who has enjoyed other books by Dobson but I found this one to be grating at best. It was a waste of time.Not recommended."
3,It was ok at best,"I bought this book based on a recommendation from a close friend. I read the entire book in the course of one weekend. I personally did not find very much in this book to be useful to me. I am a stay at home mom of 8 year old twin boys. I gave the book to my x husband for him to read, maybe he can get something out of this book. It seems to be mainly geared to be read by fathers and not parents of boys in general. I would not recommend his book."
2,Not What I Had In Mind,"When I purchased this book, I expected to get good advice on how to parent my son. Instead, mixed with some reasonable advice were completely irrelevant and offensive sections on homosexuality and the evils of working mothers. I was most offended by Dobson's homophobia and it's incorporation in a book billed to be a book on parenting"
1,I want this OUT of my house.,"I received this as a gift from well-intentioned relatives. I can accept a Christian bias. Even a conservative Christian bias, but I am not going to keep such hurtful messages in my home. It goes against everything in me to destroy a book, but I don't feel right selling or donating it and subjecting some other family to this trash. Before I throw it into the recycling bin, I'm going to read every word in it so that I can never be accused of rejecting it without reading it. But then it's off to be destroyed because I would hate for my son to find this book some day and think I had accepted it's message. I read enough already to know that it's mostly the homosexuality chapter that makes me so angry, but the positive messages can be found in other, less hurtful books."
1,You can't be serious,"Seriously, lets examine this book. It takes a warped view of Christianity, mixes it with old fashioned bigotry, and combines it with fear and more hate to bring you the new manual for how to bring up a boy to be the wife beating, bible thumping, gay hating, self loathing figure the right wing would like the see as a model for men worldwide. This book is so offensive and filled with such hate.... but hey, I suppose it has a targeted audience."
1,Rhetorical Wish Wash,"I wanted to buy this book. After 10 minutes I saw way too many reasons to avoid it like the plague. Dobson's arguments regarding the nuclear family are inaccurately portrayed. He values marriage and biblical meanings over the ability for a parent to love their child and attempt to do the best they can.He bases his arguments on articles on the family that are a complete disconnect to the historiographical discussion going on about family since Ancient Rome. The nuclear family is nonsense, a family is what it is regardless of how many or combination of sexes."
1,From the genius who exposed the Sponge Bob conspiracy...,"James Dobson is the same Rapture Right nut who told us that the cartoon character Sponge Bob was a tool of Satan designed to make your children gay. In this book, he draws more nonsensical conclusions about how society makes one gay, how distant fathers make one gay, etc., the ugly premise being that being gay--whatever the cause may be--is something to be condemned and avoided. So, if intolerance and superstitious pseudo-science are your thing, this is your book. But if you want to step up on the evolutionary ladder and start respecting human diversity, pass on this and all of Dobson's books."
3,eye opening,"I found this book exceptionally helpful as a woman with a young son. The examples and case studies are of particular interest. The only reason this didn't score higher with me was the decidedly Christian slant. This doesn't bother me personally, but I felt the book could have held as much or more impact without it."
2,Pass it up,"Mr. Dobson has some interesting insights into boys and how they think, but I feel he has anti-women and homo-phobic issues of his own. Reading this book initially caused me to doubt my own instincts as a mother. I would recommend reading The Discipline Book by Dr. Sears instead."
1,Dobson's teachings CONTRADICT Jesus's,"What I find interesting is that Dobson claims that we should let our sons play with guns, and do the 'harmless' bam, bam, you're dead routine. He claims this is a healthy male behavior. Dobson's teachings on this directly contradict Jesus's. If Jesus was on the earth now, do you think he would encourage people to have their sons play killing people? Shooting people is an act of murder, or does Dobson not see this? The fact that children are doing it in a role acting way does not make it any less insidious. Do you think if Jesus had a son while he was on earth, he would give him the Dobson advice, go ahead son, play the harmless game of bam bam, you're dead!???Dobson's teachings directly contradict Jesus's. Dobson pulled this one out of his own ego, and his imagination of what Jesus is. Or perhaps he didn't enter Jesus into the equation at all, but decided to speak for God himself.A disturbed concerned follower of Jesus"
1,Archaic Christian Beliefs with a few facts thrown in,"This book is heavily focused on the author's opinions about Christian ideas of a family structure and archaic gender roles and has many interpretations correlating to the Bible and church. Extremely anti-femininst and spends a lot of time knocking feminist ideas, which doesnt' seem relative to the overall point of the book. Not very heavy on useful facts or practical applications. Is far more opinionated than I expected."
1,Very socially conservative viewpoint,"This guy is very conservative. He believes women should stay at home to raise their boys, but boys need to decide whether they will grow up to be men or women, based on the examples from their fathers. If boys grow up to be gay, it's because they didn't have masculine role models, according to Dobson.His approach is very unscientific and relies too much on articles and editorials from the popular press (e.g., newspapers and magazines). For example, the references for his chapter on ""The Origins of Homosexuality"" are mostly from the popular press. He includes only one reference from a peer-reviewed journal and that is from 1968.If you agree with this guy's social agenda, then maybe you'll like what he has to say. Otherwise, I'd look for something based more on solid science."
1,It's too bad we can't give negative stars,"My husband and I received this as a gift and were appalled at the anti-feminist, homophobic, religious morality rhetoric contained within this book. It is a dangerous misrepresentation of imperical psychological data to formulate correlations that are not only incorrect but also insulting. The level of chauvinism and bigotry are astounding. The author includes amusing antecdotes and a few remedial suggestions for raising boys. However, this only hides the fact that he wants you to raise homophobic, masogonistic children that will be more confused about themselves and the world that they live in. You will be better served choosing another book."
1,Don't look for actual advice on raising a boy,"If you are looking for parenting advice on boys, do not choose this book.The bits and pieces of good advice you can find throughout the book are common sense and intuitive for any caring and educated parent.I am not even going to argue with James Dobson's opinions. Everybody is entitled to their own beliefs. But I do have to say I was appalled by the narrow-mindedness and overall negative world view. As a working mother I felt insulted to be told (more or less directly) that I am basically endangering my child by exposing him to daycare and public school teachings because I am a greedy overachiever who is not willing to make enough sacrifices for my child."
1,PREACHING OR TEACHING ?,I bought this book thinking it was going to teach me something about raising my boys. Instead I got some right wing conservative preaching to me about the unravaling of society based on this obvious strong religious beliefs. If I want preaching I go to church. I want to learn about how to raise my boys. I also don't agree with the dicipline part. So in a nut shell it says spank your kids and send them to church. What a quack.
1,"Read not for information, but for humour.","James Dobson has yet again attempted to use an ""advice"" book as a vessel for his religious dogma. He uses Bible verses to justify every bit of poor, or, in many cases, false information which form the core of this book. Clearly, Dobson refuses to believe any modern scientific evidence if it conflicts at all with the Bible, a very poor mindset to hold indeed. This is a predictable effort by him: Many of his other works are being used to achieve the same goal. I wouldn't buy this book under any circumstances."
1,Christian Fundamentalism at it's Worst,"Sexist, homophobic, and offensive. This book shows a complete disregard for science, research and psychology in favor of Dobson's own personal biases and Christian proselytizing agenda. If this is the kind of advice you're looking for, save your money. You can go to Jerry Falwell's church for free."
1,Interesting look into the worldview of a complete nut.,"Dobson is a dangerous theocrat with extreme paranoid fantasies about homosexuals. Read it for the humor value, but don't take this guy too seriously. Watch our for the kool-aid."
1,I wish I could recommend this book.......,"..... but I can't. There's really nothing new here.If you want to read a book that is both insightful and practical, try Robert Lewis' Raising a Modern Day Knight. This is an excellent book for those who have no ""Manhood"" plan at all for their sons. For those who do have a game plan for their sons, Lewis' book will be a great resource in the firming up of those plans. Raising a Modern Day Knight by Robert Lewis is definitely a ""Five Star"" book! Don't waste your time with Bringing Up Boys."
1,Should my daughter listen to God or to Dobson???,"God has told my daughter to become a doctor, she is so bright, and will save lives. And God has told her to have children, she would make a wonderful mother. God wants this, my daughter wants this, and I want this. But wait we forgot to check with the master authoriy..Dobson. Dobson's commandment says girls can't have careers and children too. Shall my daughter listen to God, or to Dobson?My daughter will listen to God. Dobson will be bitterly disappointed. For a moment there, he will be reminded he is not God."
5,Great reference...,"that I will continue to review as my boys, ages 5 and 2, grow into men. It not only gives lots of practical advice and reasoning behind it (i.e. NEVER let a child have a TV or computer in his room - would you let a stranger into his room in real life?), but also shows why our society is having problems with our young men. In an age when we are told that fathers are not only unnecessary but often an obstacle, this book shows how a father is truly essential for boys.He does speak from a Biblical point of view, but what do you expect? That is his life's work. His life revolves around his faith, as does so many others in this world. This is a must read for any parent."
2,Dobson's World View,"As a newly single Christian mother, I was truly seeking advice for how to parent my 3-year old son. What I got from this book was a lot of information about the state of the American culture and the American family. I found out about a lot of the problems in society that threaten masculinity, but Dobson's cure (the traditional, nuclear family) is already unavailable for me. Unfortunately, with the massive amount of societal commentary, I got very little parenting advice."
1,look good work lousy,"If you want a cute frog or turtle for your garden buy the sprinkler, but if you actually want to water something don't bother.The clamps would not hold the tiny tube securely when even the slightest amount of water pressure was turned on. I am assuming I connected it together right, but not even sure about that. Instructions? None..Was really disappointed in this whole thing, it would have been perfect for where I wanted it to go in the middle of a flower bed."
2,Hate this product,Don't buy this kit if your looking for some good water pressure. Very disappointed in it's performance the water has no force to it when it comes out of the head. The three adjustments are no better. My old Moen was much better.
2,Danelectro D-6 Fab Flange Effects Pedal,"Danelectro D-6 Fab Flange Effects PedalBad news concerning the Danelectro Flange: I was hoping for something close to the Boss Flanger ""No Dice"". I am disappointed in the Danelectro brand for releasing such garbage. However, I am not blaming Amazon at all for Danelectro's mistake. Amazon.com provides an excellent variety of products to choose from and unfortunately this particular item doesn't represent Amazon.com at all. I gave the Danelectro Flange 2 stars only because if you were to want a little something extra for your guitar sound, here it is. I own a Danelectro Fab-tone distortion pedal, I payed $69.99 for this item and it is my favorite distortion pedal thus far. Too bad about this other cheap piece of junk they've stamped their name into. Sorry Amazon but I must admit this just isn't a product worthy of the Danelectro name."
3,Fun While it Lasted,"I bought this unit from another outlet. I thought 15 dollars was worth the gamble to see if a flanger would be useful to me. It's a fine effect when used sparingly. The plastic case some people complain about is not that big a deal. It's pretty sturdy. I don't see it breaking just because you drop it, or even throw it, on the ground.The bad news is that 5 days after I would have been able to send it back, day 50 of ownership, it seems to have taken a turn for the worse. It developed an annoying hiss/buzz when it reaches the apogee of its sweep. I tried to figure out some way of isolating the problem hoping it would be one of the cables (Why would that be better? The cables cost more than the pedal!)but it turned out to be in the flanger itself.I'm going to replace it for sure with a more reliable pedal but this thing served its purpose and hopefully I can adjust the setting and take the noise out of it and use it on my practice amp."
4,Awfully good product for under $20.00,"The plastic housing is a little bit of a turn off, but I'm not an idiot kid trying to smash everything anymore. That said-- this effect sounds great. It's hard to believe that such a useful pedal is so cheap. Try it out-- you can't lose."
4,"Not bad ,has a great sound","Great effect,Sound is amazing .Only on thing I would change ,is the covering if you have a heavy foot the peddle is not going to with stand getting kicked on and off alot before the plastic breaks ..Danelectro isa great company I have used there peddles for a while.One thing to change would be a durable cover,(steel) ten the peddl would be perfect.."
3,Knitting for Dogs,"If you like fluffy, sometimes silly dog coats, this is the book for you. I was hoping for some ""real life"" dog coats that were attractive and serviceable. I was disappointed. But go ahead and by it if you have a small breed dog that you want to dress up with lots of novelty yarns."
3,Dog coats,"I was a bit disappointed in this book, all the wool is specialty wool and pretty hard to find. Also it all needed to be hand washed. There was only the one knitted coat for a tiny dog, so the cover was a bit deceiving, made it look like it was a pattern book for tiny dogs. I have a teacup yorkie and was just looking for a pattern book for teeny tiny coats, so if anyone out there can suggest another book with exactly what I am looking for , I would really appreciate it.Thank youNora"
5,5 Star Service,"Book arrived earlier than projected and in EXCELLENT shape! Looking forward to making clothes for Mocha, our newly adopted Chihuahua. Thanks!!"
1,knitting book for dog sweaters,"Book did not state it was for advanced knitters. Most of the patterns are a bit too difficult for me to make. Wish that was stated in the buyers info. Unfortunately, I wasted more than $12 on a book I won't be using."
1,Barking up the wrong tree,"It does not appear that the patterns in this book were fully tested before publication. While a pattern may work for a small dog, the pattern was not appropriately adjusted for a slightly larger dog. For example, the holes for the legs are misplaced and the bib does not fit."
1,Useless and why can't I give zero stars?,"I ordered this book with the thought I might be able to make a few of their projects. Not. They specify yarn types by brand, and those brands are not available in my country. Yes, they give a gauge, but what am I supposed to do? Buy every yarn available and hope one might conform? This book is only advertising for the yarn brand and of no help to someone who only wants to knit their dog a sweater. I will probably burn the book when the weather is cool enough for my guys to need a sweater........."
3,Review for Knitting for Dogs,"The book is attractive, but I was disappointed in the complexity of the designs. Guess I was looking for more detail work in the knitting."
5,Starrett 13A Double Square Review,"Excellent Measuring tool! Nice to have the confidence of an accurate square. Coupled with low price and Amazon's quick fulfillment, it's a no-brainer.Thank you,Loyal Amazon CustomerNC, USA"
5,double square vs combo square,"I own both and use the double square 'twice' as much as the combo--just feels better in your hand, and it is practically indestructible if dropped. Changing the blade orientation requires you pushing up on the tightening mechanism and holding as you insert the blade groove. It would be nice to have a 1/8th--1/16th marking on both sides. I rarely have a need for the 1/32-64th markings."
4,Very entertaining!!!,"I just finished reading this. It is written really well, and I like the way she wrote the woman characters, they were all strong individuals. The story gets really intense toward the end."
2,Heads Strip,I used these screws to repair a rocking chair. Even though I pre-drilled holes the heads stripped while using either a power drill or power screwdriver. In the end I had to use a regular old hand screwdriver and be very careful. The experience was very disappointing.
4,"Great Atlas, Poor Binding","I bought this atlas for my husband. He's really into geography and such, and he really likes the atlas. My only complaint is that they are poorly bound. I bought it for him for Christmas and by the end of Christmas day the whole back cover had separated from the main binding. I sent it back and got another one, and when I first opened it and looked at it, the same thing was already happening to it, and we hadn't even used it! We decided to keep it anyway since it wasn't hurting anything really and he really enjoys reading it. Just watch out for that problem as it seems unlikely that we would get the only two books that were falling apart in that manner. Also, he said that in the first one we got, some of the maps were right across the center of two pages, so you couldn't see the part that was down in the center where it goes into the binding. In the second one we got it wasn't as severe."
3,good.,"I actually bought this MP3 for temporary usage but to my surprise, this product was great! It was very compact and I used to take it with me everywhere. The sound was great but the earphones stopped working after a couple of months. The battery life was not so great either. Unfortunately eight months after purchasing it, the player would not turn on. It would charge but would not turn on. It also would not let me access the music that I had put on it. But overall I think this is a good player and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a simple and compact player with great sound."
5,1 GB MP3,"Simple to use, and the inexpensive price on this Creative Zen trumps the cost that is added to other manufacturers who mass advertise to sell their product. This internal battery 1 GB MPS is perfect for my active lifestyle. I take it everywhere. The software is simple - like drag and drop, easy to change tracks. I'm very happy -"
5,excellent small mp3 player,"I bought this mp3 player to take with me when I'm snowboarding - it's cheap, durable, and I don't miss having a display, since it usually doesn't work well in cold weather anyway. The Stone only has basic controls, but I don't really need a whole lot more than next/back/on/off/vol up/vol down when I'm on the hill. I bought a keychain case for it, so I just clip it to my jacket and I'm good to go. If anything were to happen to it, it's inexpensive enough that I could just go out and grab a new one. Also - if you can, encode in WMA and you'll be able to get a LOT of songs on it."
5,Works great,"WE gave 2 of these to my girlfriend's younger siblings as a Christmas gift. They love it. It has the same space as the Ipod shuffle at about half the price and works with Windows Media Player which is nice. It does not require other software though there is an optional download that comes with the MP3 player. Simple, easy, and very small. This is the perfect starter MP3 player for kids and may come in handy for its size for adults."
2,works great!,"Got this for my daughter. Easy to load songs onto. Charges with usb, so no need to buy tons of batteries. Decent headphones. Worth the money! Cute pink color."
4,"Pretty good, nothing fancy","Well, I like my little stone, it's easy to use and fairly good looking- verrryyy tiny. The earbuds that came with it are almost completely useless, they fell out of my ears 8 times in twenty minutes, and I was just sitting down. The player works just fine, will easily accept drag and drop music (and Jpegs and whatever you want to stick on it)... but the stupid USB adapter cord is hard to keep track of. I'm actually not sure where it is at the moment. All in all, I like my little ipod nano knockoff, but it doesn't have any frills, so don't buy one if you want fancy equalizers or radio or pretty moving pictures."
2,NO NAPSTER COMPATIBILITY,"I bought this item because I've owned several other creative zen products and never had trouble with them (plus i have a vendetta against apple, ugh) but this is the first creative device I've owned that DIDNT SYNC WITH NAPSTER!!!! Maybe they will update this feature in the coming months, but until then, NAPSTER USERS BEWARE!!!!"
2,Creative Zen Stone MP3 Player,"I bought this to listen to audio books downloaded for Windows Media Player and Overdrive through the local library because their program does not work with i-pods. The Creative Zen Stone player is difficult to determine what chapter you are listening to and you have no visual. There may be several chapters located in the same folder and you can spend a lot of time trying to determine your ""bookmark."" The music quality is good, just not good for audio books which was my only purpose for purchasing it. It would be nice if Apple products could be used with the library downloadable programs."
1,"i used to love all things pink, but this just sucks","After charging all night, I attempted to turn this mp3 player on and no luck. I heard nothing. Since there is no screen or noise, I had no idea what was wrong. I thought maybe there was no music on it, but then I reconnected to my computer and it was preloaded with several songs. Then I went to the creative zen website to try to find more information and nothing helped. Therefore I sent the player back."
2,Made cheap,"Came with ear buds that one wire to one was way longer than the other, luckily I had other sets. It has flaws in the music that is loaded into it, even though I know the songs are flawless on the PC. I do not recommend buying this product and am most likely going to return it."
1,Do not buy the pink one,"I ordered one of these after reading the reviews of the black stone trying to decide if it was a good product. I have had good luck with other Zen players so I thought this would be a good buy. I got from the people who reviewed the black stone that this was a great piece of equipment at a great value. Well, maybe it is if you buy the black one, but the pink one is a piece of junk. The first one (yes, I returned it for another one) would not charge at all, would not turn on and generally refused to work. I returned it to amazon thinking the one I received was defective, until I had the same problem with the second pink stone I received. At this point I do not want another stone and I will be looking for another mp3 player."
1,will not play music,"What a piece of junk. It will not play any downloaded music purchased legally. The first one I ordered did the same thing and I just thought it was a malfunction, but the second one does it to. I can add downloaded songs through Windows Media and it will play, but if I do it that way I can't set up folders for my music. If I go through Creative Media Lite I can set up folders, but it won't play music. Should have never switched from my sansa."
3,Creative Stone 2 GB,"I purchased this MP3 player for my brother's birthday. My brother needed a MP3 player that was simple to operate and could stand up to some abuse. While creative still has a long way to go in debugging their software, Every now and then my brother's creative freezes during recharge and he has to push the reset button. The battery life is as stated 10 hours, and the recharge time is usually one to one and a half hours on a USB1 port (it may charge faster on the USB2 port). I like how easy it was to set up and load the mp3 player. The size and square shape of the player make it pocket friendly. If you are looking for a simple affordable player that just plays music and audio tracks this player is a great choice."
5,Great Buy for Price,I got the Pink one for Christmas. It worked perfectly. The headphones that came with it had EXCELLENT quality. This was a very good mp3 player for the price. The battery life on mine was about 15-20 hours depending on the length of songs. Only thing I didn't like about it was no screen! So i have since got one with a screen!
5,Great for beginners or as a backup player :),"This is a great little player. It's not feature-rich, but if you're buying a player to work out with or you're not really technically oriented, the Zen Stone will blow you away.It's attractive, feels good, and the controls are in easy reach for any sized hand. Also unlike many players, this one you can load by drag and drop and you can rename or delete just as easily. Or you can get the free software for your computer from Creative, and not only use it to manage your Zen Stone, but also use it to rip your CDs to it.It charges in your USB port or you can buy an adapter, the headphones sound pretty darn good and it's easy enough for kids or first-time MP3 player users. And you sure can't beat the price. This thing is cheap enough to be an impulse buy, yet good enough to be very much appreciated as a gift."
5,Would buy it again in a heartbeat,"I bought this a year ago when I had to take a business trip and knew I'd spend extra time in airports. It's been absolutely perfect for me. It takes up virtually no space in my purse or pocket, is easy to use, and holds plenty of music for a day trip or two. Some people may consider the USB-charged battery a liability, but I like the idea of not throwing batteries in the landfill. I bought a generic USB charger for my car so that I can charge it when I'm on the road, and that solved the problem of not being around my computer to charge it. The included software is remarkably simple to use -- took no time at all to figure it out.All in all, I'd definitely recommend this little jewel. While the capacity will not interest a person with a big musical library, it's perfect for someone who wants to have their favorite music at their fingertips."
3,"Sounds and performs great, but won't play all the music.","I really like the way Zen Stone sounds and how small it is, but for whatever reason it WILL NOT play all the music I sync to it. I've filled its 1GB compacity, and it will only play about 30% of what was put on it. I know because I've taken shuffle off and went through the whole thing. It may be something with just mine, but that's the only issue I have with it."
1,I must concur with those who never got it to work,"I have the black one, and this thing has been a frustration from the beginning. I have never got it to work. My PC recognizes it, but gives me an I/O error. Media Player refuses to recognize it. I have never got it to play, and can't figure out why. Now it does not turn on at all, and I figure it is a dead battery. It could be my problem, but with nothing but a blinking light to go by - how can you tell what is the problem?"
1,Creative company,"I bought a Zen Nano (no longer sold) and it had a glitch and would no longer allow you to upload files even though the player was empty. Technical support told me to reformat the player and when I did, it never turned on again. This happened with BOTH my Nano players. When I went to customer support they told me I was out of luck. I do not recommend buying from this company Creative Labs."
5,ahh.....the memories,"I loved this book as a child and when I saw it, I had to have it. I used to imagine going through the washing machine. I did not remember that this book had very few words, but my 4-year-old grand daughter now loves it too. we made our own ""people wash machine"" out of pvc pipe (an idea we found in a Family Fun magazine)."
5,"works OK, but had to get it replaced",returned to manufacturer for a new one. Failed out of the box. But replacement worked well with installed Reporter Network.
2,"More like 2 1/2 stars, really","This book is well-written, but the heroine is frankly dull, with no depth, and the hero is so reserved that it's hard to warm up to him. There's no heat between the two main leads. The 2 1/2 stars I grant it come from the charming secondary characters, and the plot line, which is better than average for a Harlequin. I appreciated the way the author varied to and from the heroine's and hero's viewpoints. Still, it was mostly the heroine's viewpoint and she's kind of weak. It had sweet moments but frankly this one could be passed over."
2,Big Promise - Average Results,Bought the oversized ability - I thought. Battery life is only marginal. Very disappointed with short service life. Keep the charger handy.
1,Always...Music Forever,"I was disappointed. I have the other CD, On Eagles Wings, which is very inspirational. This CD is just broadway stuff...bautiful music, but not what I expected"
3,Campy and Dumb but a Great Spoof,"I rented this film because I had rented ""Starved"" and really liked what the film makers did with that movie and I wanted to see more of their work. I'm not sure if it was the completely unoriginal script (which I noticed wasn't credited) but this one was bad. They must of gotten paid a lot of money to make this one. However, about half way through the film I began to realize that it's not a horror film at all, but a campy spoof on horror films! One of the most notable scenes in the film involves a bat and a naked man and ... you get the rest! I wouldn't say the film was a total loss -- Joe Estevez was awsome! Monique Parent was actually pretty good in a part that didn't ask her to remove her clothes. Kudos must go to the poor actor in the shower scene and to the girl (Leslie Garrett) who gets locked in a clothes dryer! I think the Director should stick to his own material like he did in ""Starved"", it is obvious he tried to make the best of a pretty smelly story."
1,just plain bad...,"This movie was just plain bad. It took two sittings to watch it as it literally put me to sleep. The script and direction are horrible, and the actors have zero energy, except for Joe Estevez, who tries really hard to inject some life into this dud. It's not even enjoyable in that bad movie kind of way. And Monique Parent keeps her clothes one throughout the entire movie. No T&A in this one. Save your time and money. My DVD was full of glitches as well, lots of digital artifacts and it freezes up during the credit sequence, which might actually be a good thing for those crew members whose names we don't see!"
4,Nice toolset,"I had some 1/4"" hex bits that I've used a lot but came across a need for Tamper Resistant or protection torx. These are made well and certainly work in non-tamper resistant screws as well. These are also better than the 1/4"" bits because they can fit down small holes that some manufacturers like to put their screws at the end of. You will probably still need some of the smaller torx wrenches (I assume because they don't make tiny tamper resistant screws) but these are nice to have if you need them. Seems to be made of a decent metal too... I haven't had them deform on me yet."
2,A no-go for all,"This figure is not what I expected. I expected The usual from a seed msia: articulation, accessories, and accuracy. It has very few of thees. While it LOOKS good, it simply does not mach the anime mech. Posing does not work well. accessories Are the only thing this figure really did right. Overall, not much bang for your buck. Skip it."
4,"Nice form, some good weapons, but some things just don't work.","This figure has a great sculpt, with plenty of good articulation. Its large sword, large rifle, and beam rifle all function well and are quite impressive. Unfortunately, there are several things that aren't so impressive. The beam boomerangs barely hang in its shoulders, making even posing it as it appeared in animation a difficulty. In addition, it has parts that cover the hands where the beam shields go. Instead of just molding the pieces into the hands, they are swappable between the various hands. While nice looking, just like the beam boomerangs, they barely stay on the figure. This pretty much destroys most of the resemblance the figure has to its animated counterpart, and that's no good."
3,Excellent but...,"I really enjoyed this book. It had a vast array of monsters and nice color pictures. What annoyed me is the humor Dave Elliot and the two co-authors put into this book. Then more than half the beautiful color pictures have arrows pointing to them with stupid captions, again with dumb humor. Next time they plan on revising this book, leave the humor out and the stupid lines pointing to the pictures. If those two were left out it would be five stars all the way."
3,About misinformation in this book,When it describes Dracula's Daughter it says 1933 as the year it was released. Actually that film was released in 1936. Other mistakes too though I cannot recall anyothers right now.
4,"Entertaining read, but too many errors to earn 5 stars...","Like several other reviewers, I noticed a large number of factual errors in this book. The author clearly did not bother to watch many of the movies he used as source material. Having said that, this book is obviously meant as a tongue-in-cheek guide, so I suppose accuracy takes a backseat to humor.This is a 5 star book in terms of humor and entertainment value. So I'll deduct a star for the errors and call it a day. (Note that I purchased this as a bargain book and paid ~ $5. Given that it's a paperback and <200 pages, I certainly would NOT have paid the cover price of $19.95.)"
4,"Mistakes aside, the book is a lot of fun!","Like the other reviewers, I have found my share of mistakes in the book. Information is faulty, pictures are mislabeled, and some of the ""aside commentary"" is lame in the humor department.Then, why do I give it four stars?Well, the book is great for the boomer (and older reader) that recalls the great monsters of filmdom past. They are all here in their black and white or Technicolor glory: ""The Deadly Mantis,"" the ants from ""Them,"" James Arness as ""The Thing,"" the various actors donning Dracula's cape, the Frankenstein monster, ""Hellraiser,"" and so many others.I especially like the page devoted to dragons, featuring the winged serpents from ""Dragonslayer,"" ""Dragonheart,"" and the more recent ""Reign of Fire.""And what monster book is not worth its weight in gold profiling ""Gorgo.""The monster size comparison chart in the book's appendix, whether completely accurate or not, brings a few smiles at that.Who knew that Mothra was close to 500 feet tall!!!"
5,"Kong, Frankenstein's Monster, Norman Bates and Shrek","For 100 years of movies and TV, monsters have been apart of the imagination of many geniuses; from monster animals, to monster men, to manufactured monsters and many more kinds of monsters. King Kong, Frankenstein's Monster, Shrek, the Munsters, Tarantula, Norman Bates, Dracula and Many more. For any one who loves monsters this is the book for you."
2,Another mistake the book makes,It claims that Eddie was Grandpa Munster's nephew. Huh? Eddie was Grandpa's grandson.
4,A fantastic travel/garden/social/cultural book!,"Beautiful writing, and a delight to read. You will go back to it over and over again!"
4,A delightful read!,"Richard Goodman's year in France produced more than a beautiful garden, it also produced a wonderful book! Needing a break from the hustle and bustle of New York, Goodman and his girlfriend Iggy rent a house in a tiny village in France for a whole year to just get away. Wanting to connect with this town and its' people, Goodman offers his help to those who will take it. In doing so, he comes in close contact with the land itself which leads him to decide he will grow his own garden.What follows is this man's love affair with the people, the land and the simple act of creating and nurturing life in his small plot of earth. Wonderfully told in beautiful prose, Goodman's story will leave you feeling happy and content and, oddly enough, wanting to grow your own garden although perhaps in your own backyard."
2,not worth it,"As an avid gardener, I was excited to read this book and then sorely disappointed. The author is clueless and not in a charming way, he seems to approach his garden as one with ADD would, later abandoning it entirely after much help and assist from others. His infatuation with a young frenchman is strange. The book does not give insight into the french not does it illicit any clear gardening instruction or technique. He and his girlfriend simply plop the plants they bought into the ground. With nothing else to do, he is at the garden twice a day weeding and watering. The author clearly has friends in publishing for this story to get binded."
1,french dirt,"i read the customer reviews for this book and thought i was in for a real treat. 4 stars , 5 stars--what in the world were these people reading. the book was boring, silly and a pretty much waste of time. one review, which much to my chagrin, blasted the book for what it is, was not available before i made my purchase. this guy goes to the south of france -why? he's bored with the big city? makes a few friends and grows his first ever veggie garden. so what!!! the book has no point. forget about it!!!!"
3,"Worked great, then stopped receiving signal where other models can.","This worked great. It was a bit of a pain to set up, but worked great once it was. Then... no more signal, no more alerts. Just suddenly and for no reason (not dropped or anything.)I bought another brand of handheld NOAA alert radio and placed it in the same spot this has sat for 3 years. The new radio picked up two signals (3 and 7). The Oregon one could only barely pick up channel 7; the new one gets 3 and 7.Worked for awhile, but no longer."
2,sometimes works,"I originally bought 3 of these for ourselves & our two son's families. My one son's never worked & then a recall was issued. We sent all 3 back & received new units. We can get most items set on it, but so far it has not actually worked when the local tests are run, so I'm sure we would not be notified if an actual weather situation was in our area. I'm still looking for an alert radio that works all the time."
1,Don't even bother...,"I can't believe it actually worked for those other people. I had to throw it away, wasted my time and money. Hair did not go away after following the instructions ""very carefully"", step by step."
2,WARNING: ABRIDGED!,"These tapes are abridged, which was not included in the description. I must say I was disappointed. For example, in Pride and Prejudice they skip from the first dance of the story to when Bingley leaves Netherfield - not acceptable to me!"
5,How'd they do that?!?!,"Well acted, well written, I watched this to pass time and ended up LOVING this movie. The only part that got kinda annoying was the ""witty"" best friend of the main character. Well worth it for sure, you won't be disappointed."
4,"Violent, extremely funny, and just enough heart to make this a winning movie","As a die-hard hockey fan I was eagerly awaiting the chance to watch this movie. In so many ways this is a new ""Slap Shot"" in the sense that hockey movies and can be great and hilarious. Sean William Scott playing the role of an enforcer is worth it. I wasn't pissed I spent $9.99 to watch it."
2,Don't believe the hype,"Watched this primarily based on Jeff Marek gushing over it during his MvsW podcast. Why is everyone giving this dud 5 stars? This flick doesn't deserve a thumbs down, it deserves a middle finger."
2,Formulaic and predictable,I LOVE hockey!!! I LOVE hockey movies!! This hockey movie BLOWS!!! Within 5 minutes you know exactly what is gonna happen. And it ain't entertaining.
1,Terrible,"I am surprised about the good ratings this movie received from everyone. The acting was terrible, the plot was terrible, everything was basically terrible. I would recommend doing anything except wasting your time watching this movie."
1,Ignore All the Positive Reviews,"I'm fairly certain all the positive reviews are folks paid to leave positive reviews. I can say with 100% certainty that this is the biggest piece of crap ever committed to film. There is a reason that it made damn near nothing at the box office and only in theaters for a couple of weeks.This is not a modern day ""Slap Shot"", that was a good movie. If you choose to waste 92 minutes of your life like I did, then more power to you."
1,couldn't get past the raunchy point of view,"I tried to watch this film, but I was unable to get through the first 30 minutes. The vulgarity and exploitation of people in the film made it unwatchable. I kept hoping for the shift from the foul language to some sort of moralistic (at least) tale . . . after 30 minutes forget it. There's not much redeeming here."
4,Slap Shot Deluxe!,"A fantastic, well-made, funny hockey movie with a lots of blood and a little love. Different than Slap Shot but just as good. Worth your $4!"
5,Actually has a decent story,"First of all this is being compared, unfairly, to slapshot. This movie is not near as good as the classic movie nor does the main character have the same charm as the Hanson brothers, that being said this movie is worth the price of a ticket! Great story with really good acting. I would highly recommend this movie and I think anyone who rents it will enjoy it alot! There is a high amount of cursing, maybe not child appropriate."
5,Fantastic,"If you love hockey, Goon is the greatest hockey comedy since Slapshot. It isn't going to be inspirational like Miracle, but it will make you want to watch it again and again."
5,Goon,"It was one of the best new hockey movies, and for once he did not play stiffler ............... It's a have to see at least once"
5,One of the better sports films to date.,"I loved this film! If you are a fan of the gritty filming style of Slap Shot, you will get this. Language, gratuitous violence and brief sex and nudity. Oddly, a tender love story thrown into it works well. I enjoyed it from beginning to end."
3,Great Story but Painful to Watch,"I would follow Sean William Scott off a bridge and this is one of his finer performances. When an actor takes a step out of his usual stereotype and he does that here. The love story aspect to this movie is compelling and keeps you watching through the hockey bromance that occurs on ice.Overall this is a wonderful movie and hockey is a sport that doesn't have enough quality films in its genre. The family life social pressures storyline falls flat but they keep those scenes brisk and you dont get bogged down with themMy only complaint is the love of blood and violence. The producer gets very in depth with the bone breaking, blood spitting, and teeth missing. There is no reason this script wouldn't be just as engaging with less graphic violence. The over use of computer graphics sells short a top notch story. Your kids can not watch this unless you really want them to see some gore."
3,fast and easy transaction,Funny movie a movie that was really cheesy but makes you laugh and feel bad for a dummy hockey player.
2,"Dumb, Dumb, Dumb",I love Jay Baruchel but this movie was just plain stupid. And I'm a hockey fan! Could you make hockey players look any more dumb or the game itself more about fighting than actually playing?
3,Goon,"If you're not expecting much, ""Goon"" may surprise you. It's a little deeper than one might think,not much, but a little. Crude, occasionally funny and sometimes sappy, this movie is about average."
3,Better than expected,"While this film in no way compares to the far superior ""Slap Shot"", it does a credible job as a comedy involving hockey with perhaps even some realistic drama. Seann William Scott does a decent job playing the goon, a disheartened bouncer who gets a chance to use his skills as a hockey enforcer. Seann wins over his naysayer teammates through grit and toughness and helps them regain confidence while experiencing plenty of his own growing pains learning how to skate and play hockey.Seann slowly gains the teams respect and eventually takes on another legendary goon played by Liev Schreiber at the end of the film.One thing to note, the writer of the film Jay Baruchel, unfortunately inserts himself into the film and his character (language/crude behavior) will likely put some viewers off.Other than that, a very watchable movie."
3,Okay at best.,"This movie had some potential. It has a decent cast and a decent filming budget- but it fails in its writing. It isn't as good as SlapShot (Though honestly- that is the greatest hockey movie ever made) or Youngblood but it is better than a few others that have come along since. Throw it in on the bus and have a few beers while it plays in the background. The opening is pretty funny, but it does downhill from there."
1,Jr High,"This was an absolute joke of a horrible movie. It seemed like it wanted to be as funny as an old school Happy Gilmore with the whole rough-guy hockey thing, but there was ZERO creativity with it. They also used the F word in nearly every sentence. The F word sounded forced, largely unnecessary, and in a desperate attempt to make something funnier than it was; add some shock value. It didn't work, and it just made the movie seem even more stupid.I would MAYBE have found it entertaining in Jr. High, but not high school or even college, unless I was inebriated somehow. But, even then my time would've been better spent seeing something else.There has only been two other movies that I have ever not watched all the way through in my 32 years on this Earth, this is now the third."
1,Really??!,"I don't understand how anyone liked this movie, let alone how it got such a high average rating. The writing and acting are atrocious. I love action movies, I love sports movies, but this one could barely be called a movie at all! I'm just stupefied by the reviews this has received. Was it because of the corny comedy? Was it because of the language and violence? I don't mind any of those things in a movie, but when you combine it with contrived dialogue that not only sounds scripted but is delivered with such a absence of acting, it just becomes something absurd.The only thing I liked about the movie was Liev Schreiber who, as usual, delivers a good performance, possibly one of the most underrated actors around. I'd have given the movie two stars because of him being in it, but the movie was so poorly made and acted that I couldn't do it!I'm happy for those of you that enjoyed the movie, I suppose, but for me, this movie is possibly one of the worst I've ever seen!"
1,I would have given Goon negative stars if it was allowed,"Worst. Movie. Ever.If it was possible to give negative stars as a rating, this movie would have earned them.I expected crude humor and stupid jokes from the creators of ""Super Bad"", but this movie was so un-funny and just-plain-stupid that I can't even use the words ""humor"" and ""jokes"" as ways to describe what happens in the movie. I expected clever jokes that would make me pee-my-pants-from-laughing-too-hard... but instead I ended up with a headache and 2 hours of my life missing.""Crude slapstick comedy"" doesn't even begin to describe the lame-ness of this movie."
4,Love this movie,"This is one of my new favorites. Funny, crude and if you love hockey this one is a must have. One to stay in my personal collection forever"
3,Gave it a chance - it was good!,I'm not a hockey fan but really enjoyed this film. The plot was good and Seann William Scott gave a great performance.
3,it's OK,"as a fan of Slap Shot it's hard to find many ""hockey movies"".after finding out about this movie ( even allot of my friends that play hockey have never heard of it ) by accident thought it was worth $10 bucks to check it out. plus the main character is based on a local cop.the main character is fun. he's just a simple guy that doesn't mind trading punches for a living. his sidekick buddy is a little too over the top obnoxious and his love interest is a floozie that decides her hockey fighting goon is ""the one"".if you like hockey it's not a bad movie and right now we need anything with this lock out going on."
5,Great Movie,This movie was very good. I was surprised how great the story and acting was. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys sports movies.
4,Immensely enjoyable,"The best hockey movie since Slap Shot, Goon is an immensely enjoyable treat. Seann William Scott plays Doug, a dim-witted but kind-hearted bouncer that finds his true calling as an ice hockey enforcer. Soon enough he finds himself in Halifax making a name for himself, eventually earning the love of the crowd, fans, his teammates, and catching the attention of veteran league thug Ross Rhea (Liev Schreiber). In between all that is some hilarious moments and brutal hockey action, all of which gets captured almost perfectly. Jay Baruchel, who co-wrote and co-produced the film, is on board as well as Doug's foul-mouthed friend, who chews every scene he's in with gleeful abandon. For what it's worth it isn't perfect, but Goon delivers the goods for hockey and comedy fans alike. There aren't that many good hockey-related movies out there, which helps make Goon all the sweeter. Check it out, you'll be glad that you did."
4,True Son and Heir of Slapshot,"Evidently Hollywood kicks out a hilarious,classic hockey-comedy once every 35 years. Salpshot in 1977 and Goon in 2012.I just saw this and laughed the whole way through. Not only a great sports-movie, a great hockey-movie but just a great movie-movie as well. The humor is vulgar in the best possible way. Great acting, memorable characters. Goon is a complete original with a smiling nod to Slapshot.One question: How did this not get a wide release in the theaters?"
2,2 stars for his 2 fists,"Goon is a true story about Doug Glatt. Being a fan of hockey and a fan of all the main actors in this movie made me think I'd really enjoy this movie, but I didn't. The acting is very dry, but probably had to be because that's how the script was probably written. The movie is very slow also and keeps you wondering when it'll be over. If you're into hockey and like true stories then you might like it, but I doubt it. I had a better time googling and reading about him then the movie portrays him."
2,Movie Can't Skate and Has No Story,"If you're looking for a good movie to watch, don't be fooled by the high ratings given for this one. The movie looks like it's going to weave together some other back-stories (i.e. his parents dislike of his choice, his relationship with his gay brother, his wanna-be girlfriend history, his teammates, etc), but the movie spends absolutely no time in creating any story of any kind. The ""Goon"" is portrayed as an idiot, but the movie never goes beyond the basic information of an mentally ""challenged"" wanna-a-be hockey enforcer who can't skate and his unexplained loyalty to his team just because they gave him a job. It's clear why this movie didn't last in the theater, but it's not clear to me why so many others rated this movie so highly."
1,sucked,not worth watching unless your 15 hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha well yeah i think that about says it dosent it? well i think so!
4,Good Job!!!,"Good job on this movie! It was a feel good, route for the underdog movie. Had some funny parts and had some what the hell parts, all in all I liked it! That Sean william scott fella did a great job, I think the whole cast did :)"
3,"funny, raunchy not too bad","pretty funny, raunchy movie. my main suggestion is to re do the soundtrack to be more in line with a sports movie. its not too late, grab a linkin park song and run with it. now that i've mentioned it, you'll really notice how lame the music is. think of rocky, karate kid, almost any sports movie has at least one rockin song"
4,Funny hockey movie,Some well known actors in a basic slaps hot style film. I recommend for sports enthusiasts and others who enjoy lowbrow humor and action
5,Loved it... totally a chick flick for guys too,Who doesn't love a good underdog story? Add in the fact that this is based on a REAL person (man i love that guy)... and especially when he's hot and he gets the girl in the end... and along the way he beats the holy crap out of everyone who deserves it... the fight scenes were AWESOME and the story was memorable...the characters are absolutely irresistable. It makes me want a hockey guy of my own. In the meantime I'm going to rent this again and watch it a couple more times! He was totally blessed by the fist of God. :-)
5,Way better than I'd expected!,"I fist saw the poster of this movie on my recommend list. I'll be honest I thought it was going to be a mindless, occasionally funny, spoof. Anyway, a long story short I rented it and I was actually blown away at how this movie was a genuine good comedy. It wasn't super vulgar. It developed the characters wonderfully, and it had a pretty good storyline. This movie instantly moved up my list of favorite comedies like Happy Gilmore and American Pie. I completely recommend it! And its not even in theaters yet! I wish Amazon would do that with a lot more movies!"
2,"Movie was great, but...","Product was NOT in the condition stated and was, in fact, much worse off. DVD case was cracked and the DVD itself was scratched. It was cheap so I did not bother to try to get a refund or exchange."
5,One of my favorite hockey movies!,"This is a goofy movie, lets get that out of the way. But it is entertaining as hell and is centered around hockey and the life of a goon. In terms of hockey movies it is up there with all of them. It does center around fighting and violence so viewer be ware.I really enjoyed it."
5,Love this movie,"I greatly enjoyed this movie it was a great role for Sean William Scott. The plot is solid, and you do not have to be a hockey fan to enjoy this movie. Take some time and watch this film. You will not be disappointed"
5,Goon is a winner,"As a hockey player, this movie does it right. One of the biggest false beliefs is that hockey players are all goons. This not true and this movie clearly shows this. Sean William Scott plays the role with understated humility and control. Yes, it is violent as the game is, but underneath is a love story. Very well done. And Doug ""The Thug"" Glatt follows the code."
5,LOCK and LOAD,"First, let me just say I'm not a hockey fan and the last hockey movie I saw was The Mighty Ducks when I was twelve. That being said, get ready to be impressed. This movie has it all. It's chalk-full of action, comedy, drama, and yes it has its' moments of obscenities, but never does it divert from the heart and soul which is HOCKEY. Oh yeah, and luv the characters portrayed by Seann William Scott and Liev Schreiber in the movie...Not roles you would typically expect from two fine looking men."
5,Goons are people too ;),"Based on real-life enforcer Doug Smith's book, Goon (2011), screenplay by Jay Baruchel and Evan Goldberg and directed by Michael Dowse, is an absolute HOOT! Seann William Scott shines as the sweet bouncer-turned-hockey player who is good at one thing: protecting his teammates.A must-see for anyone who likes a heartwarming underdog story but especially fitting for hockey fans and anyone who likes Slap Shot(1977).One word of caution--if you can't stand the real violence that often comes with hockey, you might not like it here. But if you can, just remember it's a movie, all the blood is fake, and the story is so worth it.(original post [...])"
4,Sleeper,where did this movie come from?!?! truly entertaining! I laughed out loud while trying not to wake my newborn. Loved it. Now time to feed the baby!!
1,Be Warned!,"As soon as I took this watch out of the box, I knew there was something wrong with the clasp. A clasp seems like a pretty simple thing, but the design here was too fancy by far. When I took it to my watchmaker, to have a few links dropped out, he too commented that it was a strange, poor design.Sure enough, it became unclasped 15 minutes later while I was driving (not exactly tough use).Unfortunately, Bulova isn't the same dependable watch it was ten or more years ago, this company is routinely churning out low quality products.Just in case you're in love with the face and thinking of changing the clasp on your own, you should know that the second hand is not in the traditional place (large sweeping hand) it's the little dial at the six o'clock possition."
5,Loved it!!,Beautiful piece of jewelry. It was perfect for my husband. I did not know what to expect but it was everything I was expencting!!!
2,Eh!,"This is a nice watch. However, when it came to me it appeared to have been a returned watch. There was not even a typical clear safety tape to protect the face of the watch. To say I was disappointed was an understatement. I would have recommended the watch if the presentation when I received it would have been better."
4,Unique and Eye catching,"This is a really sharp watch. I have an old 1962 Bulova and now a new one. I will say it may take alittle time to adjust to because I have several other watches I wear and the one I wear the most is titanium. Compared to that watch, this one weighs a ton. It is noticeably heavier. Can't say I ever owned such a heavy watch. Beside that thought I love the watch. Great amazon pricing and well packaged. Seems to be very well built also."
2,Love the watch. Didn't get what was expected.,"This is One of my favorite watches. Had one several years ago and lost it. Finally found it on amazon for half price and had to have it again. I got it in new condition, but the small hand was not aligning with the correct number on the hour. Had to pay an extra $80 to recalibrate a brand new watch. Good now but paid an extra $80."
3,Speed,"When you plug a flash drive into it, it takes a lot longer to save or transfer files. Good otherwise"
5,Harpsichord repair,I purchased a harpsichord in pretty poor shape. This book has walked me through the essential steps in restoring the instrument very well. I've repaired the jacks and more. Thank you.
2,To much Dangle for a Dongle,"This Dongle dangles tooooo much. Too short for the back of the computer and way to long for the front, my pc's on the floor and i had to tap the unit to the side of the machine to keep it out of the way. And since the product i ordered to use this with, didn't work. I can't talk about if it worked at all. Just felt like a cheap product."
3,Was OK while it lasted...,"I bought this device almost a year ago to replace the output jacks that were broken on my laptop. This device worked GREAT for a while, but recently the wiring has begun to be touchy and you have to wiggle it around for the best result. I ever used the mic so I can't testify to that, but I would suggest buying an adapter without wiring as it's just something else to screw up."
5,Exactly what it says on the tin,Does exactly what it says it does: turns you non-usb headset (or speaker and microphone combination) into a usb-headset. Couldn't be easier or more straightforward. If there's any loss of sound quality you wouldn't tell by me.
1,Works ok as long as it works,"I used the dongle together with the Koss Headset SB/49, and it did work ok as long as it worked. Because of that I almost would rate it with 2 stars but it just doesn't feel right. The sound quality is ok, so it deserves 3 stars for that.After only 2 weeks, the microphone jack broke. The dongle has a 90 day warranty, but you will have to pay for shipping yourself. Considering the extremely low durability of this product, I did not want to waste any more money on it and just dumped it.My recommendation: Find some other product or DONATE the money for some good cause and feel good about it rather than getting upset because you wasted money for a product that most likely breaks after a short period while Koss is not even willing to handle the replacement at no cost for you."
1,Save Your Money - Don't Buy This,I had high hopes for this dongle- planned to use it to reduce noise when recording vocals. It reduced the noise alright - TO ZERO! The microphone jack was dead on arrival - tried it with three different mikes including two types of condenser and one regular - NOTHING! No Sound! The headphone jack did work but it wasn't impressive - I have a Dell desktop with speaker attachment for my monitor and the sound was MUCH better through my speaker headphone jack then when headphones were plugged direct into the system via USB and this dongle.Save your money - this won't improve much of anything and probably doesn't work any better for boosting sound then the $5.00 versions everyone else is selling. BTW I am using Windows Vista and while the Koss website does say it works with VISTA I wonder about that since other similar devices say input doesn't work with VISTA.
4,"Works as described, but a bit expensive","The analog -> USB headphone/microphone adapter works as described - I use it every day at work to listen to tunes while I write software. There is no crackling or distortion of any kind, so it is definitely ""top quality"".I know that quality costs, but the price was a bit high for what this product must have cost to produce."
4,Nice little gadget,Works as a standard usb audio device in windows. Great for computers without sound cards or with broken sound cards. Little expensive though.
5,office 2003,This book has most materials to prepare for the MS certification. The spirial binding allows the book to remain open on a desk without laying something on it. I recommend OFFICE 2003 PREMIUM EDITION to anyone working towards MS certification.
4,Big Soap (Milk),"The 8.8 oz. milk soap is a big bar and will last a very long time. i was lucky enough to have a soap dish to fit it. It is important to make sure to drain the water off of the dish so the soap can dry when it's not in use. This is a very nice soap that lathers well and rinses off easily. I have not had any problem with soap scum in the bath tub, either, which is a nice plus. Everyone in my family uses it, and I think my hubby has been swiping it and using it with his shaving brush. Not sure how that worked out for him, though. Anyway, we've been using it for about two months and it doesn't look any smaller. Maybe my eyes are playing tricks, it's a magical soap, or it was just so big to begin with that I haven't noticed it decreasing in size. :)I purchased this at drugstore.com along with a few other items and got free shipping with $25 purchase."
4,Improved cleansing,"I had never heard of this product until my wife got some of the L'Occtane soap as a gift. It does not produce as much foam as some other soaps, but the cleansing ability is outstanding. One feels almost ""squeeky"" clean after a shower using L'Occtane soap. So far as I know, this product is not available locally but is easily obtainable from Amazon."
5,Received As Part of a Gift Package.......I'm Delighted,"This was part of a L'Occitane gift package from my husband. I love scented, moisturizing soap of high quality during winter. My skin dries up when it's cold. I had never used this soap before, but I will be buying it in the future. It had a wonderful, clean scent that doesn't overpower or interfere with any perfume or cologne I wear. Another plus is that is ultra creamy and moisturizing. It produces a lot of lather. Yup, my skin feels like a baby's.The price listed here seems steep, but this soap bar isn't soft and oozy. It doesn't melt like ordinary soap. This seems fairly typical of specialty soaps; they last longer and don't leave a lot of soapy residue"
4,Lady Jane Say's It's A Good Fun Summers Read.,"This was a very interesting read. At first the story line and plot was slow- but when the action got going ,I could barely put the book down. The attention to geographic and historical detail was wonderful and I enjoyed the setting of the book,as it was so refreshingly written in an un-american flavor.I take into consideration that this was her first book. Inspite of that- the sex scenes were unrealisticly written and dissapointing. I wish she had been more diverse with her descriptive repotoire.Finally I wish the main character Joe was more multi-dimensional. I got a sense that she was more at the mercey of outside forces rather than being able to take control of her own destiny:A strenth that I did sense from the character: Matilda.For a first Novel it is a good book- and great read to get immersed in but don't take it too seriously.."
3,well done but gruesome,"The plot has been described by other reviewers. The one point I want to add is that the behavior of the medieval characters is extremely brutal. Although in that way, the story is much more true to the past than most historical novels, if you are sensitive (as I am) you may find the descriptions disturbing. In any event, not something to read while you are feeling blue."
5,Lady of Hay,Lady of Hay is one of my all time favorite books! I have read this book at least three times and will one day read it again. I loved all the characters and the depth in which Ms. Erskine gives them. This book is hard to put put down once started and will keep you until the wee hours of the morning!!
3,Not Bad for a Typical Romance,"I am currently on Chapter 26 of this book after having a friend of mine force me to begin reading it. I must admit, I normally hate having to read a book that I can't finish in one night, but this one is an exception. She leaves just enough room between extrordinarily intense scenes to shut the book and come back to it at another time. Although this can be viewed as positive, it's also negative considering that I've been reading this book for three weeks, and there are several times when I find myself bored with the plotline. She could've done better, but when you have nothing to do over a summer break, you take what you can get, and I'm glad this is what I've got."
4,Lady of Hay...Loved it!!,"I bought Lady of Hay used a few years ago and didn't pick it up again for a few months. I've always been fascinated with past lives but usually the way it is portrayed is unbelievable. This book, on the other hand, is fantastic. Imagine been put under hypnosis and having a past life emerge? For the author to actually use a real person from history is great...it made me think and I even looked her up. I read this book again every few months just for pure enjoyment."
5,Great group,"Signature sound is a real energetic group, wonderful blending, very entertaining to watch... this group is going to go places!! Highly recommended."
2,Could have been better,"After viewing the first video of Ernie Haase and Signature Sound, I had high hopes for this DVD, but my hopes were let down. The music is fine, and the entertainment value is fine, but therein lies the problem. The first video with Signature Sound had some good fun mixed in with genuine heart-felt singing. This follow-up video looks like a three-ring circus. I don't question their hearts, but it looks like more thought went into how flashy they could look on stage as opposed to sending a message. The dance moves, pretended frustration with each other, and forced humor just seem to taint the genuiness of the message. Sure, let them have fun while they're singing, let them do a little choreography every once in awhile, but don't make every song another opportunity to show off some catchy move. This was one DVD where the entertainment seemed to displace the message."
3,mediocre,"My order came quickly and in good condition. The DVD started out good in the beginning, but from about the middle to the end the sound kept going in and out which was very upsetting. The content of the video was good the sound quality of the video was just poor."
2,Makes a disappointing bracelet....,"I bought this watch and it is beautiful but it didn't work! Amazon was so helpful I am going to try another one. After a while on the phone..... they refunded my money and are letting me get another one before I sent the nonworking watch back. I really love the look and feel of this watch so I am willing to try again... I have never been more impressed with customer service. I couldn't believe how they worked with me.. just goes to show if you are nice to people when you have a problem, they are generally willing to help. I give Amazon five stars for customer service."
5,Very pleased!,"This is a sleek, classic watch that will go with everything you wear or do. It has diamond accents that integrated seamlessly into the design to make you feel sophisticated. For a busy mom it is great. It is also water resistant and very thin so you do not keep bumping it. I really am very pleased."
2,Don`t seems a Bulova Watch.,"I bought for my girlfriend and she liked it, but honestly, don`t seems a Bulova watch. I already bought another models and was better than this."
1,PRice,"This product is decent but it lacks response which is a very big drawback. Also you can get this same response trigger for about 20-25 bucks at sherpers or at a local store, it's a rip off. Waste of money."
4,Good but not great,"I have a Tippmann 98 custom pro with the response trigger and cyclone feed system. The cyclone feed system works well with the response trigger and does not break many balls, I shot a whole case of cheep paint through it and it only chopped one ball. The response trigger can be a bit tricky to adjust but is fairly straightforward in its setup.My only complaint is that it has a sharp screw near the grip that can cut you if you are not careful."
5,great mod incredibly easy to install,I added the response trigger to my 98 custom pro and it was incredibly easy to do. The custom pro alreadyhas the interior setup and exterior holes drilled so it was very easy to do.I would suggest using a dab of locktite at the exterior valve hole because it can wobble a very small amount

1,Great Fire Starting Material,"I am an avid Mac user and I have purchased other ""Visual QuickProject"" books from PeachPit Press that I found very useful training tools. That was until this one which was an absolute waste of money. The book starts out good and you believe that the book is going to walk you through the actual process of creating a nice Keynote presentation. At the end of Chapter 2 you are left high and dry with only 2 slides created. You are never given any more information to create the rest of the slides. Really sad !Then thoughout the book you are shown a mutitude of other products that are suggested to you to buy. Really sad ! None are needed to use Keynote !Save your money and do not buy this book which is a total waste of money !"
5,Lawry's Spaghetti Sauce,"Our family has enjoyed cooking with Lawry's Spaghetti Sauce for years, but have not been able to find it in stores for the past several years.We were delighted to find it was available through Amaxon and have completed out second purchase. There will be more orders on the way.Our only disappointment is that in spite of the fact that Lawry's makes two stylesof their fine sauce, it is available in only the ""Original"" through Amazon. It would delight us if Amazon were to make both versions available.In spite of the fact that Amazon limits the selection to only one, we shall continue ordering and we wish to express great satisfaction with the promptness of delivery, etc.It should be noted that if both versions were to become available, we would double our orders."
5,Brilliant and richly illustrated...A Must-Have!,This book is pretty amazing! Every minor and major mythological figure is covered and every page contained rich photographs and illustrations. A proud addition to anyone's library. A reference book and so much more!
4,Theseus and the Minotaur,"This book was excellent, i would advise anyone to read it. It told you a lot on mythology and heros."
1,Rhodes ???dont make me laugh.,"The only enigma here is why was this...was ever recorded in the first place. The rhodes sounds like a toy piano and the playing is worse than you can imagine. The music drones on without any interest for 50 minutes without any direction, its not even ambient! Just DULL...The rhodes is a beautiful instrument, here it sounds like...a kid's home keyboard, and a badly recorded one at that. AVOID! AVOID! AVOID!"
1,Reading this trash,"Ms. Wallace, who is currently in prison for attempting to committ a murder on behalf of one of The Hillside Stranglers, attempts to explicate programs which truly rehabilitate prisoners. While her mission seems worthy, the result is poorly written and the whole publication seems amateurish."
5,FIRE POWER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"gun setup: Tippmann A-5,18"" smart-parts all-american,remote system, response triggerpaintball experience: 4 yearsthis is an awesome mod for any tippmann, the a-5 is already packing serious fire power but when I added the RT my opponents were crapping thier pants when i shot at them. Yes the a-5 is a gas hog, and yes the RT runs off gas, but who cares?I just have a twenty ouncer and I get at least 700 shots off it.another cool thing is the RT doesnt make it hard for someone to shoot semi auto. I can still shoot semi just as easily plus I can go full auto when the situation calls for it. this is one of the most powerfull mods you can get!"
3,A Pretty good addition to an A-5 with a few faults...,"I can not give this item a 5 star rating, because it has its faults. First, it is not easy to install onto the gun. You have to take the entire gun apart. When installing the internal parts, it comes with cheap, small o-rings which fray and break easily. It also will not work if it is not always oiled and perfectly sealed.If you can get it onto the gun with no problems, it can save your butt in a match.IT is a pretty good addition, especially because you can use it in an official paintball field without it counting as an automatic gun."
1,This is for X7 only. Not A-5,"I have to return this product because I have an A-5 which fits this description, but does not fit the product. This product is X7 only. The A-5 is a different product."
5,SOCIOLINGUISTICS,MY NEPHEW IS BIG INTO LINGUISTICS HE SAID HE COULDN'T BELIVE IT THE BOOK WAS EXCELLENT AND HE WAS IN HEAVEN I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY I PURCHASED THROUGH AMAZON
1,What Price Love,"I usually love everything Stephanie Laurens writes, and bought What Price Love in hardcover, anxious to have a new Laurens novel. Unfortunately, I found it very repetative,and borderline boring. The dialog concerning racing was informative for a bit, and then tedious. The characters were self effacing and so very gorgeous that I think they loved themselves more than each other. It is the first Laurens book I have not completed. I kept trying, and finally gave up. I'm still a big fan and this willnot stop me from getting her next book, as she is a wonderful writer."
3,Pretty good for a Cynster extender,"Although I enjoyed the book there were a lot of little things that distracted me from the plot. Pris and Dillon were a little hard to take at first with all their ""beauty and charms"" but I warmed up to them eventually. The Dalloway/Dallings thing confused me. Laurens never really put it out there that Pris was using another last name and for the first couple chapters it drove me nuts! And I thought Flick was Dillon's cousin...how does that make Demon his brother-in-law? Over all it was entertaining, not as good as the first six but a pretty quick read. As always it's fun to see how the older characters are intertwined in her new novels. I hope she continues the seris but I would like to see her shake it up a bit in the next one."
1,TERRIBLE,This is the first book that I actually returned. I could not get past the boring racing setup and the fact that these two conceited people only have eyes for each other...because they are both so very beautiful. I couldnt get past the first chapter. Yuk!
2,Disappointing - Formulaic and dull,"I used to LOVE Stephanie Laurens' novels -- especially her Cynster books. Sadly, she's lost that special something that made one fall in love with her heroes and sigh with satisfaction when the novel ended.I reserved her latest book at the library, and am grateful I didn't spend more than the 75 cent reserve fee for it.In ""What Price Love?"" Laurens presents stiff cardboard characters without intriguing personalities. The details about horse racing and ""the book"" Dillon was protecting seemed like filler to meet her contract page quota. The mystery was flat, and the ending rushed. Even the traditionally exciting love scenes weren't as hot as usual, because who could care about these people?I am really, really sad to see a favorite author churn out such a lifeless tale. ""What Price Love?"" gets two stars instead of one only because Laurens at least gave us an update on some of the other Cynster families."
2,What a disapointment!,"I was really looking forward to this newest edition from Ms Laurens, and I am still shaking my head over just how awful it is! All the way through I felt as though I were in a parallel universe where all the familiar characters were poor imagages of other novels. There was nothing to make you like the hero or the heroine... nothing to connect them to the reader or to each other. Who was Dillon? Who was Pris? What were their big secrets? Who cares? The mystery didn't last through the middle of the book, the romance that we expect never even started (not, we all know, the same as sex). Just poorly written and inexcuseable from an author like Stephanie Laurens."
1,Worst book yet - Don't bother,I used to love Stephanie Laurens' books and purchased the entire Cynster series (1st generation). The Bastion series has not proven to be as good so I stopped purchasing and read library copies. This last series (2nd generation Cynster)is nothing short of painful. I struggled through Gerard Debbington's story (The Truth About Love) but at least I finished it. This book I stopped at chapter 6 as a waste of time. Ms. Laurens stories have gotten so formulaic and boring that only the character names seem changed from one book to the next. Ms. Laurens should really consider retiring the Cynster saga as these latest very mediocre (I'm being kind here) books denigrate the original series.
2,Potboiler,"Such a shame that Laurens is getting to be like Amanda Quick (AKA Jayne Ann Krentz). The contract calls for another book and so one is spewed off the computer. I agree with the reviewer who designated this title as BORING! I had to force myself to finish it. The hero and heroine are cardboard cut-outs a la Agatha Christie, the plot is laughable, and the anachronisms abound.And why is there so much sex? 20th century erotica in a victorian dress just does not work!I have to say that if there is one more book like this I will be giving up Stephanie Laurens for good."
2,Major Ditto Anne Fleming!,"Anne Fleming's 3/22 review is spot on! Nevermind that readers are supposed to sympathize with these two tortured, rich and devastatingly attractive people, this book's biggest failings are that it's overdone (Laurens has a horrible habit of saying things 4 and 5 times when once - maybe twice - would have sufficed), there is no plot (!), and it's horribly BORING! What's going on with the romance genre?!?! Everything is so BORING lately! After almost 6 years of buying everything she wrote, I stopped buying Laurens' books awhile ago, but took a chance on this one. What a mistake."
1,Are you kidding?,"Poor poor Pris and Dillon - they are bogged down by the weight of their own extraordinary beauty and their ""wild and reckless"" -- someone should actually count just how many times that phrase appears in the book -- natures. The entire population of England AND Ireland wants them and they are excessively bored by it all...until they meet each other, that is. At last, they've each found something stimulating, but the trade-off is that WE are the ones who have to be bored for the rest of the novel. There's a convoluted and stupid subplot about horse racing featuring a mysterious supervillain who doesn't actually make an appearance until the last fifty pages, just in time for him to threaten the well-being of our dramatically alluring heroine so our hero can save her. And, not to give it away or anything, but save her he does, although by that point you'll probably be wishing he'd been a fraction too late in your haste to be rid of these characters and their cliche psychoses.Skip it."
4,Love the Cynsters,"I haven't read this Cynster novel yet. But I thought I'd point out that ""The Truth About Love"" is the book where the painter is the hero--a dashing one he is too. I've loved most of the Cynster novels and the one's I didn't love, I sure like. If you haven't read Stephanie Laurens before--give her a chance!"
1,A Waste of Money,Do not buy this if your kids actually want to play with the figurines. My son broke the cat's head off in less than 5 minutes. He has some other figurines (Toy Story) from the Disney Store that have been months of entertainment. This purchase was very disappointing for him (and me). Lots of crying...
3,"A bit wordy, but not bad","I enjoy suspense thrillers, and like to pick up new books from time to time. I really enjoyed the way this began, but after the first 2 chapters the story dragged in some places. Choppy in others. Mr. Lalos must be an English major, as he uses many adjectives, and describes just about everything. Alright at times, but other times I found myself skimming ahead to just find out what the heck is happening already.Comparative to other suspense/thrillers, this was unique in its story. I wish there was a bit more gore, as I found myself craving for more! Not bad for a first attempt. I'll be curious to find out what his next book will cover."
3,Who or What is Killer?,"Today's Books/Public News Service review listing of SlowBurn, October 19, 1999:Rating: Good!Peter Lalos, Washington D.C., writes horror-suspense of isolated miners facing evil, deadly force. Who or what is the killer?"
4,Once again Archangel Michael doesn't disapoint us.,"This book was brought into my life at the exact right time, you know how that can be at times. The knowledge and love that comes through in this book is truly uplifting and enlightening. There are parts of the book that flow so nicely that I actually read aloud part of the book on my radio show as a guided meditation for the listeners, I may do that again in fact. I recommend this book to anyone that is looking to learn more from Archangel Michael and wishes to be uplifted in the process. Once again Archangel Michael reminds us that we are never alone and we must never give up. Thank you Lori for taking the time to share Archangel Michael's love and knwoledge with all of us. Thank You."
5,A Hallelujah Victory Book,"The mighty warrior angel who bested Satan is now giving us words of hope and courage in these last days as the end of time approaches. He is a champion for Christ, indeed! I just praise the Lord for this angelic hero!"
4,"Quick and easy meals, but not for a pro chef","I would recommend this book for a way to get additional recipes for your collection that are easy to do. I am a pretty good cook, and can do lots of fancy recipes from scratch, but sometimes I just don't want to take all that time, and just want to throw something together from the cabinet (other than Hamburger Helper). The writing style of the book is easy to follow - you don't have to be a master chef to understand the ingredients, yet you also don't get sick of a bunch of cutesy words (EVOO anyone?) like some other popular cookbooks. Pictures of each meal are included, which is always nice to have in a cookbook.If you are learning how to be a great cook, this is not the book for you. But if you want some quick and easy meals, this and her other Semi-Homemade Meals book are great choices."
3,easy cooking,"Sandra cooks the way I do so i was excited to get this cookbook. It is not for the health conscious and she uses a lot of products that are high in sodium but you can easily modify it. I have tried out several recipes so far and they have all turned out pretty good except for the grilled cheese dippers (too hard to flip). If you are looking for some easy, simple recipes then this book is for you. My only complaint is that there were no tablescapes in the book and that is something I was hoping they would include."
4,something that u could whip together in a flash,i watched ms lee on foodnetwork all the time.i like her style.quick n in a whip of time.so i decided to buy her cooking book 2.so far i did few frm it my family like it i i would recommend to anybody.
5,Very Satisfied!,"Semi-Homemade Cooking 2 is only cookbook I can honestly say my husband and I both enjoy using. Not everybody has time or energy to make the various pieces and parts of a main course from scratch and Sandra Lee's book does a great job of showing you what you can do with ready made ingredients and a little creativity. There are no extra frou-frou steps (like adding vegetables, etc. to make it look like there's more food on the plate) and the recipes are straight forward-- if you want a flavorful beef, chicken or pork main dish there are plenty of unique ideas for rubs and marinades. This is a cookbook for people who want flavorful food and can make their own side dishes instead of having a one-stop plate full of everything mixed together. If you're looking to enhance your gourmet cooking repertoire then you'll be disappointed, but for the rest of us who just want something that tastes good, these recipes are a great place to start."
3,half and half...,"I have by no means made every dish in this book, but have found that about 1/2 of the ones I have made are very bland - and 1/2 have been very good. So far, I have not tried even one dessert in the book that did not end up in the trash after tasting it. I prefer desserts that are sweeter than what this book offers... So, I have found a few great recipes in this book, but would not have purchased it if I had known that I would only have a 50% success rate on flavors... I suggest borrowing this book and trying a few recipes before purchasing."
4,classic 1969 british blues rock,"pretty much a blend of savoy brown (the songs and vocals) and peter green's fleetwood mac (the guitar). also elements of early jethro tull,. john mayall bluesbreakers etc. if you are into british blues circa 1969, give this a spin. an unheraldeded gem!"
1,Subjective,"Attractiveness is subjective.It's not something that can be quantified. It's different for everyone, so to suggest that one element, the mixing of ethnicities (because the only real race is human) causes a person be more attractive is completely false.As for health, just as a person can inherit the strengths of both ethnicities, so can they also inherit their flaws.I knew a girl in high school who's parents were black and white. She had very pale skin (she burned very easily) and sickle cell anemia.She also wasn't very attractive, at least to myself and the few people I know.There goes that theory.People are people. There is no one ""race"" or combination thereof (again, a misnomer) that makes ""better people""."
1,Wishful thinking,"If you're prone to agree with the title of the book because anecdotally you agree that interracial people are healthier and more attractive, then you might like this book and have your bias conclusion reinforced. Otherwise don't bother spending your money here, it's a story of wishful thinking."
2,slick and shallow book,"i read this book recently and while there are some interesting points and some thing that will get your attention, i found it to try to sell something that can't be proven and also it can't possible speak for everybody and there upbringing genes, etc.. it tries to spin the wheel and say we all belong to the human race and yet it doesn't address the obvious racial hatred and tension that still exsists today and also this book trys to mask selling a look when in fact that is all Hollywood has ever done and alot of this book to me has a Plantation mentality. this book might have been something if it had have explored the full scope of its subject matter a bit better."
2,Pretty Silly Overall,"The book is a very cursory ""study"" (and I use that word VERY generously here) of multiracial individuals, filled with fluff and little else. I initially found it quite offensive because it is so pedestrian and stereotypical, but after sitting with it awhile it does have some fun elements to it ... perhaps because it is so simplistic I just laugh at it. If you're interested in the subject, take a look at it even if it's just to see this side of the racist argument. Just don't take it too seriously."
1,This review is coming from someone who is mixed race,"I cannot give this guy any credit except making a hypothesis that mixed people have more symmetrical features compared to the rest of the single-race world. Symmetrical people, Mr. Ziv tells us, have better features, lose their virginity at a younger age, and are just plainly the most beautiful people on earth. I differ on this opinion. If you reference Kip Fulbeck's Part Asian, 100% Hapa, you will find mixed-race people of all shapes and sizes. We're talking about photographs, which Mr. Ziv does not have in this book. So there is nothing much here aside from generalized conclusions. Nice try, Mr Ziv. Perhaps a different idea for your next book?"
1,Load of Poo...,"I could not sum up this book better than the first commentor. This book is pure SPECULATION. The only reason this book gets a 'star' out of me, is the fact that the commenting system requires it."
5,good introduction to OpenScript,"I already knew programming, but was not familiar with OpenScript. This book introduced me to OpenScript, providing a quick way to learn the language. It is well-written, and suitable for the beginner who has minimal programming experience. Hustedde's writing is clear and logical, making learning easy."
1,Don't buy the software if you have Windows 98.,"I really looked forward to receiving the software version of this book, but when it came and (on 3 1/2"" floppies) and I installed it, it kept committing fatal errors. I don't believe that it can be run with Windows 98."
4,Tiffany Swing Arm Wall Lamp,"This is a BEAUTIFUL LAMP!! The only problem I have is to turn it on and off, you have to turn it at the wall unit, I was hoping it turned on at the lamp itself!! Oh well, it still is a LOVELY LAMP!!"
5,BEAUTIFUL,"THESE LAMPS ARE JUST BEAUTIFUL - SOFT, BUT ADJUST UP FOR READING VERY PLEASED AND RECEIVED IN RECORD TIME"
2,Does not fit toddler pillow,"Just recieved in the mail and put it on my daughter's pillow. The pillowcase is extremely too big. The pillow falls out if I pick it up without grasping the fabric together. While the fabric is soft, it won't do much good, if it won't stay on the pillow!"
2,these had great reviews,"these had great reviews so I assumed this would be something I would love however I did not think they were that great and could not keep the object on the slider. This worked better for me Magic Sliders 39719 Nonskid Caster Cup . It says non skid, but they slide like a champ."
5,A Must for New Parents,"At last, a book that combines well-documented information about the physical and emotional benefits of keeping your baby close along with practical instructions on how to actually use those tricky wraps and slings. This is the book I wish I had before my first child was born. Great photos remind the reader that babywearing is not just for able-bodied moms--moms in wheelchairs, dads and other caregivers can all put on a sling or carrier and give that baby the unconditional love and affection she needs to thrive. A perfect gift for any expecting parent."
1,Not for those who love sailing,"I love to sail and was considering buying an SC31 which is why I was attracted to the book.Very little of this book has to do with sailing and in fact after slogging through it I know nothing about how the SC31 sails. My wife and daughter sail and I have read many books on sailing by women as well as men. This is one book I would not recommend to any person, male or female, whom you hope will want to try sailing.It is basically about a person who can't seem to make any relationship work and wants to share that aspect of their personal life, over and over. Most things are someone else's fault, and the charity of others is what keeps this odyssey going. This is a glass half empty book.I guess my assessment is negative because I was expecting a book on sailing."
5,An Amazing Adventure,Pat is one of the few women who have sailed solo around the globe. The few negative reviews here have mentioned Pat's failures and suggested she funded the trip relying on the charity of others. Pat's backstory makes her accomplishment even more incredible. Pat is an accomplished artist who sold paintings along the way to help fund her continued voyaging. Very few solo sailors will have made their journey without receiving some help from others. One can not help but wonder if the few negative reviewers who gave this book one star are envious of what Pat has accomplished on her own.
1,LOGO WARNING!!!!!,"All I can say is the 1-star is for the Good Times DVD. They have their logo throughout the film, thereby ruining it for the viewer and rendering the DVD useless."
3,The Flick Stings America's Youth Obsession.,"I just watched this flick and enjoyed it. It tells the story of what length people will go to regain youth. Starling is a CEO and model for a successful line of cosmetics but, like all of us, she is growing old. Enter a strange little man who promises that he can restore youh with Wasp Royal Jelly and Enzymes.The treatment works but is slow, too slow for Starling. She sneaks into the lab and injects a massive dose to speed the process. It works but with horrible consequences. The enzymes change her into a wasp woman, who kills her enemies and eats them.The story is hokey but the underlying idea isn't. Like many of Corman's movies, this one dealt with a very provocative topic, the American obsession with youth and the lengths people will go to keep it, and treats it in a half-serious, half-humorous manner.The effects are lousy, especially since Corman films bees and not wasps, but you get the idea."
3,SyFi movies,"are my special love. This one, like so many others, are B-grade but if you like sci-fi 50's movies, this will make your collection complete."
3,Fun early Corman,"Available for your streaming consideration , the 1959 science FACT film THE WASP WOMAN . I'd just now seen this satisfactory female killer wasp film for the first time . It's entertaining and is a fine time capsule . The women here are lovely (in great skirts and hairdos) . Men smoke pipes , move stuff and create wasp youth juice . So , grab a fistful of popcorn and hunker down . Let the moderate times roll ."
2,Wasp Woman -- Clipped Wings!,"Any fan of Roger Corman will enjoy this movie. It retains its innocence, yet has many tongue-in-cheek moments. All the Corman steadies are here; Susan (Machine Gun Kelly) Cabot; Barboura (Bucket of Blood) Morris; the inimitable Bruno VeSota and Lynn Cartwright, whom I didn't see again until she played older Gina Davis in ""A League of Their Own"". Unfortunately, this is a poorly edited copy, with scenes cut off."
4,An Old Favorite,I watched this movie on a late-night creature feature when I was a young girl. Scared me to death! I enjoyed seeing it again after all those years. Still a scary movie. Great therimin music to bring out the creepiness! This was a blast from the past for me.
4,IT WAS GOOD BUT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER,IT WAS A PRETTY GOOD CLASSIC AND THE STORY LINE WAS ALRIGHT. THE ONLY BAD THING IS THAT THE END SHOULD HAVE BEEN LONGER. I THOUGHT THAT THE WASP WOMAN DIDN'T DO ENOUGH KILLING BUT IT DEFINITLY A 4 STAR MOVIE CLASSIC.
4,MC Sunshine - worth its weight in gold,"This recording was released 9/9/99 but is the culmination of work spanning since the beginning of time (middle school) by Matt Taylor and Derek Poore. While sometime juvenile and wierd for the sake of weird, ""Gravity"" is definitely worth a listen."
3,very easy transfer to PSP,"I tried several free PSP movie transfers but they were quite cumbersome and difficult to work with. I tried a demo of this product and by this time really appreciated how easy it was to use - just 2 clicks and come back 15-20 minutes later. You simply select how much space you have available (256MB, 512MB, or 1GB) on your PSP storage memory stick. I use the 1GB which gives me a beautiful full screen PSP movie.XOOM also lets you select other special features such as song videos and behind the scenes through their ""movie options"" button. I start here to make sure I select the main movie with english audio and then add a song video too.I store a bunch of movies PSP-converted (mp4) on my external drive for later for my daughter to select from."
4,Great symphonic rock,"Fine instrumental rock. This is one genre the French excel at. There is no denying the great composition, tremendous feeling, as well as playing talents of Cyrille Verdeaux (who plays keyboards). Other musicians you may recognize here are Steve Hillage, Tim Blake, and Didier Malherbe of Gong fame. I suppose this compares to Gong at their instrumental finest, but it's more seriously arranged than Gong ever was. There's still plenty of improvisational weirdness here (a-la ""Canterbury School""). The sequel, ""Symphony II"" is better (5 stars) although it's nearly impossible to find. You do have to be in the mood for symphonic rock to enjoy this. The most telling thing about this music is that it's not dated. It could have come from the 60's, 70's, or 80's. If you have ""Symphony II,"" congratulations! If not, get ""Forever Blowing Bubbles"" or this one. They'll all be out-of-print soon."
4,clearlight symphony,the cd came really fast! It's a real collector's item. Both Steve Hillage as well as Tim Blake!!
4,A SURE THING,"WALK ON GLASS, penned by then-syndicated columnist to the stars Lisa Robinson, is a fun and fascinating novel about, you guessed it, show business, more specifically the music industry. Heroine with the golden voice Lindel James suffers greatly in the name of talent. Her voice may be hot, but, boy, is her life in cold shambles. Robinson clearly has fun creating a world filled with double-crossing dreams and empty synthatic promises--a variation of the same theme, perhaps, but made with panache and flair. Readers will need plenty of sunscreen for this sizzler. It is a one sitting (or lying) read worthy of any beach read seeker.-----Martin Boucher"
4,Really Good Book,"Bogosian did a great job in a story that encompasses philosophy, sex, and drugs. The book is about a boy named Mal who is a tweeker going on a rampage in order that he may truly feel alive. The book also brings together another group of people who bring their own flavor to the story. The book is worth the short amount of time it takes to read and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for some entertainment."
4,Smells Like Teen Spirit,"I read this book in two nights and it worked for me very nicely. Sex, drugs and existential thinking and a pretty good plot. Bogosian comes from the theater and his characters reflect that. I especially liked the psychotic speed freak Mal. Bogosian (as I've said in my other review of his solo book) comes off as kind of simple, but at the end of the day, I think his ideas are complex. It's the way the whole thing is hung together. Long and short of it is that the book is a hot read and has a couple of good nasty sex scenes in it. I guess he's a genius, but on the other hand, who cares?"
3,Interesting,"As a whole I found the book quite interesting but to agreee with a previous reviewer, I never got to know the characters. The author would give a glimpse and never follow up. Other characters were just pointless. The book held my interest and the observations made me laugh at times but it never passed a book that was trying to show me ""look how diffrent this is"""
3,3 1/2 stars,"See storyline above.Eric Bogosian's first novel will make you look at the Mall in a different light. A fast read with a steady pace. Filled with drug induced teenagers and perverted adults, brings a sort of originality to this novel. The abrupt ending also caught me by surprise.Recommend...Library"
3,nice to also see this in paperback (decades later!!),"I somewhat recommend this dated and dry book from the SAIC of the White House Detail during the early part of the 20th Century, Col. Edmund W. Starling. That said, it is also nice to see the very old hardcover in paperback....albeit decades later!!Vince Palamara-JFK/ Secret Service expert (History Channel, author of two books, in over 40 other author's books, etc.)Pittsburgh, PA"
5,Great chai,This is a great product. Wonderful taste and is sugar free and less caloies. I would recommend this to anyone who likes Chai.
3,Kameleon,"Yes the product works, but it has its flaws. Due to everyone complaining about battery life (1-2 weeks) i turned the motion sensor off when i got it to save batteries. This was a draw back of its self because you have to push a button for the display to turn on then find the spot to ""touch"" for the controll. Great idea but it needs the motion sensor on to be practible. A charging station would be ideal."
3,Good concept with so so execution,"I bought this remote because I got sick of switching between 5 different remotes to work my complicated TV setup. It looks great, worked fine, and I loved the way only the buttons for the device I was using lit up but the batteries died every few weeks because the motion sensor went off and turned the thing on with the littlest bit of stimulation. A great idea but unless you have stock in Energizer you may want to choose a more traditional remote."
4,Battery eater no more.... After the warranty was up,"I opened it up. I read at a hack site about the vibe sensor tied to little bb's in a 1 inch x .25 inch little silver colored box. I carefully pried it open from the one side where it is is black plastic and out popped two little bb's. I removed them and reassmebled the little box and the unit and now the lights only go on when I hit a button. They stay on for about 5 seconds and a few of the buttons are a little darker now, but I don't care. Battery life is a lot longer now and the unit works like a champ. Can't do anything about the tactile feel, but it's ok, I'm used to it now."
1,"Easy to program, poor button responsiveness","Looks good, programs easily. Motion-sensing on/off is great. But many of the buttons on the touchscreen are unuseable - often it takes repeated presses to get the unit to respond. The unit I had felt like the surface plastic material was sticking to the contacts underneath. I thought this would go away with use, but nothing had improved after 10 days.I returned it - NOT AS ADVERTISED!"
2,returned!,"We bought this remote a week or so ago to control a dvd, tv, digital cable box, and tuner. While it worked (after a call to the company and some updating) I could not STAND the feel of the remote, the sound that the plastic made when clicking, and the fact that you had to look at the remote to click any button (as someone previously mentioned, none of the buttons are raised. It's like one big piece of plastic.) The vibrate function also wore the batteries down really quickly. We ended up returning the remote to the store yesterday."
2,Difficult for the lay person,"I've practiced time line therapy for a few years now and find the technique invaluable. The book, however, left a lot to be desired in that it referenced concepts not explained and jumped around alot. If you have taken a class or seminar this may be a good reference, but if you are just exploring the topic, I wouldn't suggest this book."
4,"Time Line Therapy and the Basis of Personality by Tad James, Wyatt Woodsmall","I found the information very useful, easy to read and use. You don't have to be an experienced NLP practisioner to understand and apply the material, which I can not say for some of the NLP books I have read."
3,Bizarre & Quirky Film,"Alright, the acting in this movie is phenomenal! Michael Caine & Jude Law are the only actors in this film and they do a phenomenal job of acting throughout.The set design and camera work were also equally phenomenal along with the acting as well. Plus the costuming and make-up were good too.This movie is about revenge and how a successful writer, played by Michael Caine, goes about taking revenge on the man who has an affair and steals away his wife.Some of the cat and mouse antics taken on by both characters goes a bit overboard in this movie. Otherwise a pretty good film."
2,TWISTS AND TURNS...BUT MEDIOCRE,"The plot has been discussed by other evaluators, and also the various movies and plays with the same theme/title. I'm a very liberal reviewer and almost always give the draw to the hard-working folks that do their very best...usually. Even with all the twists and turns in this treatment, and some stellar acting, I found the whole thing boring and the dialogue trite. Save your moolah on this one and look for something more rewarding and exciting, and with more clever characterization, maybe Yosemite Sam or Garfield the Cat."
2,Worth seeing after the 1972 version,"I loved the 1972 version of ""Sleuth"" where Sir Laurence Olivier played the cuckolded Andrew Wyck and Michael Caine played cocky young Milo Tindle who'd stolen Wyck's wife of 14 years. When I heard the film had been remade with Caine now in the role of the elderly Wyck, I had to see how he'd handle himself. While Caine was interesting in the reprised role, if you can see only one version of ""Sleuth,"" see the original with Olivier and Caine."
3,Sharper Image Gadgetry Replaces Mystery Genre Cliche,"The cozy, traditional English exterior still stands but the inside has been gutted and replaced with a cold, sterile design. The plot still works until it degenerates in the Pinterian excess of the final third. These scenes play like a revival of The Collection and may feel more dated than the original version of Sleuth. Certainly, no demerits on the acting front, though. Both stars are superb.There's an entertaining commentary with Branagh and Michael Caine that's at it's best when Ken quizzes him on the original film. (We also learn, remarkably, that when Jude asks him in the film ""What's it all about?"" this wasn't an inside joke and wasn't even spotted until the film was finished. I assumed that and Milo's new job as a part time chauffeur were throwaway Alfie asides.)"
1,The original is a CLASSIC ....this is a Klunker...and a disgrace....ZERO stars.,"I didn't think it was possible for me to like the original version of SLEUTH (1972 with Olivier and Caine) more than I already do...but after watching this wretched mess of a fraud...er film..I appreciate its greatness even more. While the stars all fawn over Harold Pinters script in the self congratulatory ""making of""..I was left dumbfounded by their arrogance and stupidity. Fortunately the film going public stayed away in droves and the critical lambasting this film received was correct. I must admit I couldn't resist due to my love of the material and the original but it was a horrendous waste of time and I urge you to not make the same mistake."
2,Falling flat,"Another disappointing remake. What are remakes good for anyway? I remember the original fondly, an endless mental fight between Olivier and Caine. The remake has Caine and Law. The new script is by Pinter, who proves again that he is another one who should definitely not have been awarded the Nobel prize for literature. Maybe for something else. Chemistry? Just kidding.The new version is essentially vulgar. Jude Law manages to let you forget that he is playing a part. One takes this bloke for the real man. Must be a sign of a good actor. Still. Caine is doing fine, he is what he is and does what he does.Definitely superfluous."
1,Absolutely Awful!,"Don't know why they bothered. Save your money. With these names - Branagh, Caine, Law, Pinter - I was expecting something great. This was labored, stylized, contrived and BORING! They changed the original story line in ways that dont even make any sense [I wont go into specifics - I dont want to give anything away].Worst of all, Michael Caine - god help him! - keeps having flashbacks to the original: although Tindell is now an actor, he keeps calling him a hairdresser!NOWHERE NEAR AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL - what on earth were they trying to do?"
2,A NO GO,"I wasn't aware of the original. Almost ""clever"", but fails miserably at the end, huge let down!"
2,Not as good as original,A disappointing remake of a great movie. Get the original if you can and watch it instead of this one.
2,Battle of the Minds,I thought this movie started out really well. The whitty banter between Caine and Jude Law was very entertaining and very funny. But the movie just kind of lost me after a while. It kind of became tired and monotonous.Worth a watch but not a great movie.
3,Different View,"I look at this movie in a different way. Jude Law was a producer on the film. He has been compared with Micheal Caine. Hey ""Alfie""? Possibly it was a slip or intended that the hairdresser was an actor was a hairdresser. How can you remake something? Maybe it is just different? There is context and distraction from the vantage of new technology that interlaces the film. It was a play and that was dialog. Now its video tech?Micheal Caine at his worst is always good. Jude law could have been more subtle, and let me process this situation more. If you watch both films, and just watch you may see humor in the contrasts? Maybe not?There are a number of reviews here and I am in the middle. It may be overstated.This film left me with questions. It wasn't ""wow, I want to see that again. """
2,inane ...,"... but i give it two stars because i like the actors. best scene is Law as the ... (oops, spoiler!)."
5,"Exellent, details and outlines the problem with the stock market.",This book should be taught in a college class. This details exactly what has happened and what needs to be done to correct what has happened the last 20 years.
5,Awesome!,This is one of the coolest power supplies I've ever seen and used. I'm building my own computer and this is one of the highlights of the build.
4,Not great!,"I didn't find it that better compared to cheap ones from Wal-mart. Its a little better, holds a little longer, but not by that much!"
4,Great product,"I used these years ago when I owned a restaurant for scrubbing grills, stock pots and broilers. They worked great back then, and work great now. Lasts for a year, and these are bigger, thicker and cheaper than the ones that are sold locally in stores."
2,Postage too high for what I received,The size of these are kind of hard for me to use. I took one out of the pack and gave the others to my husband to use outside. I was really upset about the amount of postage that was charged for such a small package.
1,suicide is not entertaining,"there are way to many lesbians still killing themselves because of the stresses of being a lesbian, it's not even mildly acceptable that there are still more suicide as an option - self victimization films that are being praised and sold to us."
1,WARNING: The worst acting I have ever seen.,"The acting in this movie is so horrible I could hardly stand it. I think only a teenager could believe anything about this was acceptable, not to mention entertaining. It's about teenagers anyway, painful and gross. I never want to be that hideous age again, and I sure don't want to watch such an annoying production about it. Horrible filming and sound; very poor quality EVERYTHING.Visit my listmania if you want to see wonderful lesbian movies!"
2,Not a great movie,"I was expecting a lot more from this film, having read good reviews. While the plot was good, the acting was horrible. It seemed like a high school student made it. Not entertaining at all."
1,"Could have been great, but.......","This movie is shot like a porno (minus the sex). The acting was terrible, the film and sound quality were appalling and the dialogue was laughable. It's actually quite sad as I think the premise of the movie was actually quite good. The storyline had a lot of potential but the execution ruined it."
5,Awesome book; great for kids!,"Great book! I bought this along with Boas and Pythons: Cool Pets! (Far-Out and Unusual Pets). My daughter and I are on our 3rd snake now and this book was a great read for us. I made her promise to do research on snakes as pets, write a report, make a poster and I will bring the snake to her classroom at school. She received school credit and even wrote her own book as a summary of what she has learned."
4,Must Have for Snake Owner,The book has lots of pictures showing what ailments look like and tells what signs to look for. It shows treatment options and lists drugs used for common ailments (and causes). Also a few at home remedies.It's a handy book to have in case of any common disorder.
3,good perfume for day use,"this is a good perfume for day use. not too over whelming and can be worm to work and beach as well. It lasts for about 6 - 8 hrs on an average, and even might get a hint of it at the end of a long day.definitely a good perfume to wear for a casual day out."
2,The Paleface -- and more,"I bought this after a conversation with my dentist about the film ""The Paleface"". I saw the film originally as a first run in a movie theatre, he had never seen it. Bob Hope and Jane Russell -- what a cast. The structure of the film is the same that was to be found in later years in Bob Hope's television shows. Sight gags, slapstick, extremely lightweight ""story"", and a plot riddled with holes. But it isn't presented as art, it is simple-minded entertainment. The song by Hope ""Buttons and Bows"" actually won an Oscar -- who knew! I did not bother to view the other film (""Sorrowful Jones"") as my only object in getting the DVD was to give it to my dentist to share with his family. Hope's character, after all, was Painless Peter Potter, an itinerant dentist in the old West."
2,FOOLED ME,"THE WAY THIS IS PRESENTED, I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO GET BOTH PALEFACE MOVIES, BUT I DIDN'T. IT STATES ""SORROWFUL JONES/THE PALEFACE DOUBLE FEATURE"". I THOUGHT IT WAS 3 MOVIES IN ONE. SO I TOOK IT TOO LITEREALLY. PALEFACE IS ALWAY S A GOOD MOVIE, AND SO IS SON OF PALEFACE. SORROWFUL JONES IS JUST A POOR REMAKE OF LITTLE MISS MARKER. IT WAS ACTUALLY BORING."
2,where is the paleace double feature?,"The title is misleading, It says Paleface double feature. I thought that I would get Paleface and Son of Paleface as well as Sorrowful Jones. Getting only 2 of the three was a disappointment. The title of this product should reflect this, important detail.."
5,"Delightful comedies, great for family viewing. Bob Hope, Lucille Ball and Jane Russell at their comedic bests","These two feature films are perfect for the whole family. They are terrific comedies that are well-written and well-acted. They make good entertainment.I am amazed at the strong, dominating woman who could out-shoot, out-think and out-maneuver all the men around her, portrayed in a widely released film during the 1940s in Jane Russell's character in ""The Paleface"". Understandably, the film was a smashing success when it was first released.The film ""The Paleface"" introduced the famous popular standard tune ""Buttons & Bows"", which Bob Hope sang to Jane Russell, trying to woo her.Given the prominence of the actors and their outstanding performances, I recommend this double feature for your permanent film collection."
3,bought it for one and liked it best for the other,I primarilly bought this for the paleface as I loved son of paleface. But there is one instance where the sequel is better than the origional. However Sorrowful is a splendid picture and is worth the price alone.
5,Sorrowful Jones / Paleface 2-film DVD set Review,"Even being a Bob Hope fan, I was still impressed with Sorrowful Jones. The jokes were classic Hope with his perfect timing and delivery, and the acting by all parties involved was excellent. Not cheesy at all. I hadn't heard of this film before and took a chance on it, but now I consider this to be one of Hope's best. The other film in the set is The Paleface. This one is a bit more cheesy than Sorrowful Jones but you still get the same classic Hope delivery. I wasn't impressed with Jane Russel, as she seems to be trying too hard to be ""bad."" But heck, it's a comedy film and is just supposed to be entertaining, which it is. On the bright side you get the nifty song ""Buttons & Bows."" This 2-film set is worth your while, as both films are quite good and have extremely funny scenes."
5,Good Packaging.,I can't say a whole lot here. This product is a well packaged DVD set. It is adequate in all ways.
5,The Wire seasons #1 & #2,Raw and gritty and a whole lotta fun. This is made the right way. The actors own there parts. I am never taken out of the show by the actors. It is easy to belive you are watching the real people in their real day to day lives. You may not want to have your children or your mother around when watching this as it can be a wee bit rank and randy at times.This is worth your time and money.
3,Cooking school in your home,"Whether you are a beginner or a serious cook these tapes will be informative. The content is very basic with simple to learn techniques and basic mother recipes. The english dubbing over french instruction was distracting, especially when the translation does not correspond to the dialogue. Picture quality was not as good as the Cooking at the Academy series and may mislead a beginner into overcooking most of the final presentations. This would not help anyone who has attended comprehensive professional culinary training."
1,save your money,This icee machine does not work. Basically all you do is stir the ice around. The plastic blades will not crush the ice and turn it into an icee. After reading good reviews about it decided to try it out. What a waste of money.
3,ICEE Maker,"Followed the instructions for the ICEE Maker. ICEE was salty tasting. Found metal cylinder in middle came defective and had a crack, leaking salty water into the finished ICEE."
4,"Lots of fun, lots of work","My kids got this icee maker for Christmas. I had read the reviews for it on this website, but got it anyway :). It's a lot of work to crush the ice, set everything up, crank the handle, and wash everything afterwards. That being said, my kids really love it. It's a great way to hang out together on a hot afternoon. It works well and tastes just like the real thing, though the ice needs to be replaced each time you make another icee."
1,The most frustrating toy ever,"My kids kept asking for this slushee maker - it was top on their Christmas wishlist, so I finally bought it. What a waste of money! The thing simply doesn't work!! We've tried it twice and both times we've been cranking the handle for 45 minutes but didn't get anywhere. The juice stayed as liquid as it was when we first put it in!!! DO NOT BUY THIS TOY - it is a waste of money and time! My kids were so looking forward to their first homemade slushee and it turned into an incredibly frustrating activity! The only thing you will get out of this is a workout for your arm from turning the handle..."
2,Too hard for kids & breaks easily,"We bought this gift for our 3 year old for Christmas -- he'd been asking for it for months. The first time making the slushees was fun and they tasted good, but then things went downhill fast. It was too hard for him to turn by himself, which meant that we got stuck making slushees while he did other things. And after the 6th time making slushees, it broke and couldn't turn out slushees any longer. Also, the higher the sugar content of the drink, the better they turn out, so if you don't want your kids sugared up, this is not a good choice."
1,not a good gift,It's hard to set up so many parts. After you crank your arm off you get soupy flavored drink. Not like the picture shows on the box. You have to make sure you use a cold drink to begin with. Takes forever to get your soupy slush.
4,Pretty Good,"This machine is actually pretty nice. It makes an Icee just like from the store. You have to turn it longer than the instructions say, but you do wind up with a regular Icee, just small amounts, but it will fill up the two small cups provided. It also tastes great. Also, make sure you don't overfill the metal canister with too much ice and salt or it will come out the top into your Icee and make it salty. Also remember the ice and salt goes into the metal canister (not the drink) and the drink into the mixing part. Another thing I like about this toy is that water doesn't leak everywhere when you use it. It's not very messy at all.The best thing about this toy is you don't have to buy refills. You just use soda, or juice. Clean up is pretty easy, the kids can do it.We bought both this toy and the McDonalds McFlurry machine,please read my review of it. If you are trying to decide between the two, you definately want the Icee Maker."
3,directions for use,"I am mainly writing to let other reviewers know that directions can be found on spinmaster.com. This machine is great fun to my child, but kind of a hassle for me!"
1,Don't waste your money!,"The best thing my daughter got from her purchase of the Slushee maker was an education on how easy it is to kiss 20 bucks goodbye! It might work if you crank it for about 30 minutes but we gave up after 15 and she drank a runny, goopy, sugary drink. We experimented with different drinks, more and less salt, and everything else we could think of. Still does not work. I'd rather pay the buck at Kmart's little cafeteria. If you want to make cold treats at home, I'd recommend the Mr. Snowman. It's not the same - more of a snow cone, but it's easier, MUCH faster and cheaper(around $8)."
2,save your money,"My kids received this at Christmas time. We used it once then and then just recently on a hot day. They did learn some science with the ice and salt method. For the quantity of liquid you get it doesn't seem worth the time it takes. It takes longer than the time on the instructions. It is hard to put this together and adult supervision MUST be taken seriously as the ice gets extremely cold. I thought it would be great to have in the summer, but I think we'll keep it in the closet."
4,This thing is great!,This thing is great because you don't have to use refills! It's a breeze to clean (if your mom is doing it). And the only thing bad about it is that you can't use diet soda. You can't use this if you're lazy. THIS THING IS GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Too much hassle - Get a snow cone maker !!!,"This is not a toy, it is a pain. There are too many parts,takes a lot of effort and makes a big mess. To answer yourquestion, you don't crush the ice, it's supposed to just formlike the old fashioned ice cream makers.Don't waste your money...."
1,Disappointing Surprise from Santa,"We have tried this item with several different ""drinks"" and none produced a true ""slushee"" all very watery, the kids got sick of cranking the machine, and then they did not like the end result."
3,No Good for Sugar Free Drinks,I bought this Slushee maker for my 6 year old daughter because she loves Slushees and I was hoping to make healthy ones for her instead of the sugar-laden ones you buy at the movies. I was disappointed to read in the instructions that it doesn't work with sugar free drinks and works poorly with low sugar drinks. The advertizing says you can use any drink in your fridge and that isn't true.
