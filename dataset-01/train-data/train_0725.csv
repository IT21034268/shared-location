3,Bargain Keyboard,"This keyboard has some good features, the first of which is the price. I shopped locally for an Apple-compatible keyboard and couldn't find one for less than $50. This one was $15, such a good buy that I ordered two of them. Another feature is that it is designed to be more like a typewriter keyboard, a valuable feature for me.On the down side: (1) It doesn't have a port in which to plug my USB digital camera. Since all of the ports on my MacMini were occupied, I had to buy an attachment to my computer that gave me multiple ports.(2) All the keys are black, and if I try to use my computer at night, I can't see where to place my fingers unless I turn on a light.Overall, I consider these an excellent value, and I'm glad I bought them."
1,"Not Mac compatible, cheap","The keys are labeled for Windows only. Every time the Mac reboots, I have to re-identify the keyboard because the Mac does not recognize it. In addition, like most cheapo keyboards it has no extra USB ports. The keys aren't that annoying, but they are annoying, especially if you move from keyboard to keyboard; this one will always be the odd one out, with it's somewhat small and slanted keys. All in all, you'd be much better off getting a generic Windows keyboard at your local big box store. Again: this shouldn't be called Mac compatible, despite what is printed on the box. I'm simply glad I bought it at half its suggested retail price. This is the lowest rating I've ever given a product sold by Amazon."
2,Not so great,"I found this keyboard very uncomfortable to use. I kept it for a few days only, then purchased a different one."
3,Limping keyboard,"This inexpensive keyboard works fine. It would be much better if it had a USB port in it but then it would not be quite so inexpensive, would it. This particular keyboard came with one of the elevating legs missing which is a minor inconvenience. I needed a keyboard NOW so chose to accept the inconvenience of not being able to elevate the back of the keyboard rather than return it and wait for a replacement. Otherwise it's OK."
3,"It works on a Mac, but...","Kensington has a long history with Macs and this works fine. But the layout is all PC. This is really a problem when I am used to having the Command keys next to the space bar. On this keyboard, the Alt keys are there and the Windows keys (which work like the Command keys on a Mac) are just outside of them on either side. I couldn't figure out a fix for that. Also, the Kensington Keyboard utility shows up in the Preferences panel under 10.2, but I could never get it to recognize that there was a Kensington Keyboard hooked up to the computer. I gave up and bought a Matias USB 2.0 keyboard with a dock on top. It's great and works like a real Mac keyboard."
1,bad for me,"The ""\"" key is located somewhere very uncomfortable (below ""enter""). As I do a lot of programming and need to type the key pretty often, it's just a painful to use the keyboard. I regret I hadn't examined the layout of keys carefully before purchasing it."
1,horrible keyboard,This keyboard is awful. The shift key on one side is difficult to press. And the number keys across the top have now started to intermittently stop working altogether. Should have sent back right away when I realized the shift key was sticky but didn't and now doesn't seem worth the money to send back for a partial refund. Wish i'd saved the money here and bought something that worked - would put an exclamation point there but can't b/c that key doesn't work.
5,The original netbook!,"I've had a 12"" iBook G4 since 2005 and it's still my favorite notebook for browsing the internet, writing letters, and even reading pdf's. It's very lightweight and I consider the screen the perfect size. It's held up very well. One of the keys has a hairline crack and one of the rubber feet on the bottom fell off but I clean it every month or so and it still looks almost new.My only criticism is that it gets a little warm so I keep it on top of a clipboard when holding it in my lap. No viruses, no crashes, no worries.When netbooks started becoming popular a couple of years ago, I had to laugh because I already have a lightweight, handy netbook. In fact, I'm using it right now to write this review. Given a choice between a new Asus or Dell netbook or a used iBook G4 for the same price, I would take the G4 without thinking about it for a second."
1,Buyer Beware,"Product doesn't protect near what it is rated to. Yes I followed the directions, but now I have permanent ear damage (bad Tinnitus) due to trusting this earplug at an outdoor firing range. Everyone else using various other earplugs were fine. Do yourself a favor and use Hearos or Howard Leight brand and don't make the same mistake I did."
4,VINTAGE PIGPEN,"I left this DP 22 as the last one to listen to since I've been on a DP kick and trying to track down all I can for my growing collection. After reading about the sound quality issues I wasn't sure what I was gonna hear. To my ears this sounds quite good for a ""1968"" live SB recording period and although I do agree that the vocals are low in the mix, folks it really isn't that hard on my ears at all and quite enjoyable for vintage Pigpen show. Just take a listen to Caution and Feedback which are two of the tracks that stands out for this listener. It's not one of the greatest shows however I've heard worse and this is a excellent document of a early show."
2,"Historically Relevant, but Musically Disappointing","For hard-core Dead fans, this Pick is a nice addition to your collection, showcasing the band's late 60's development. But newcomers should be warned that the sound is a tad raw, the arrangements a little scattered, and the vocals hit and miss. There is nothing about this collection that really makes my spirit soar like many of the later picks."
3,Killer - 'Broken Silence' (Mausoleum),"To avoid any and all possible confusion, this is NOT the Finnish pop band Killer nor is it (obviously) the corporate band The Killers. This is a lesser-known Belgian heavy metal band. Nothing out-standing here, but an okay ensemble to check out when you have the time. Tracks here that tend to stand out are ""Crash And Burn"", the *ss-kicking ""In The Land Of The Pharoah"", ""Only The Strong Survive"" and ""A Matter Of Time"". Personnel: Paul 'Shorty' Van Camp - guitar & vocals, Bart Verhaert - bass, Dave Powell - keyboards and Fat Leo - drums. Might draw in fans of - say ... Motorhead, Mothers Of Track or even Thin Lizzy."
5,Michael Stuart...uno de los mejores salseros!,"Sinceramente Michale Stuart es uno de los mejores salseros de todos los tiempos. Tiene una mezcla entre la salsa moderna y la salsa tradicional. En este disco ""Retratos"" se puede notar la gran calidad vocal de Michael Stuart. RMM Records ha hecho una gran labor de promocion y produccion para este exelente cantante. Algo que asegura el exito de este disco lo es la produccion de Ralph Mercado y Angel Fernandez. Los mejores temas de este disco lo son ""Niña bella"", ""Destino"", ""Pero Ella"", ""Como Decirte Adios"", y ""La Soledad De Tu Amor"". He tenido la oportunidad de ver los shows en vivo de este salsero y da el 100% de su talento. Michael es un exelente imitador de su padrino musical, el maestro Domingo Quiñones. ""Retratos"" el mejor disco de Michael Stuart."
5,GREAT!!!!!!,"This cd will have u jamin! With hit's like Nina Bella, Destino, and Hasta Cuando. The music sounds great, and Michael's voice sounds more strong and powerful. It has beautiful love songs and also sends a positive message."
5,Hey Jackass,"You know what there is a true jackass who reviwed my movie that Dumb SOB gave it 3 stars and said it was a waste, what a jackass?!! Steve Ausin wrote: >I wrote what's on the top jackass"
3,It was a poor quality video,"I thought that this video was a poor representation of what the wwf was capable of. It only showed recent bits of Austin that everyone has seen time and time again. As far as I am concerned the only bit of real value that this video had was to show that Austin truly is the toughest SOB in the wwf, and we all already knew that. So, as far as i am concerned this video was not only a waste of time, it was also a waste of money."
4,"Focuses on Austin, the wrestler and the man","This is a great tape. It focuses on Austin's career in the WWF from he fatal injury suffered at the hands of Owen Hart in the summer of 1997 up to his current reign as WWF champion. Highlights are shown along with interview segments with Austin and Jim Ross. There is colorful language and Austin's infamous ""sign language"", but it is a good tape because it captures the real Steve Austin moreso than the ""Stone Cold"" character from his first tape (Cause Stone Cold Said So""). A definite must by for Stone Cold fans. END"
4,Pretty good but could be better,"This video is not as good as 'Cause Stone Cold Said So' There is so much more that they could have added to this video. Such as a lot of Raw clips, but they didn't! Anyway this video is pretty good. The most attention-getting part was when Austin says what BMF is. I think you would have to be a little dumb not to know. I recommend this tape to all Austin fans, but see 'Cause Stone Cold Said So if you can as well!"
1,Hey whimps,Hey this video sucked big balls!WCW rulz!If you whimpy Austin fans have the guts E-mail me all you pieces of trash
5,Every song a treasure,"We bought this on tape when our first son was a baby. Now he's 19, and we still listen to it. It is so unusual in its simplicity. Everyone who has heard it loves it. I've used it to accompany a slide show presentation of our kids growing up. Brought tears to people's eyes. I've given it as a baby gift, and am still being thanked. Thank you J Aaron Brown."
5,"wonderful, soothing lullabyes for both parents and child. timeless rocking chair bonding music","Product recommended to parents of newborns to create a warm, safe,nurturing environment of soothing, rocking chair lullabye music which will promote bonding."
4,Knobs are two per package,"I ordered four, and when they arrived they were two per package. So I ordered twice as many as I needed!"
4,"Batchelor is a fellow studetn, not a teacher . . . and this isa commentary","In some ways I agree with ""Jim Williams"" review, though I do not see this commentary as harshly as he does -- and I see Batchelor as I always do, as a commentator, not a teacher. Not a good beginner's book on Nagarjuna's seminal work, but I am currently studying this in depth, and so appreciated Batchelor's work as I might enjoy sitting talking to another serious student, even when I saw his shortcomings. If you are beginning, read Nagarjuna as a translation and sit with him."
5,My best live album,These old men tell short stories and jokes while playing kick ass songs. 'Nuff said!
4,Not Bad,"Found this in the 5$ bin at Wal-mart... worth it if your a true fan, otherwise, don't waste the money.. it is willie, it is johnny... its a match many have wanted for years, but in all honesty, I thought they would have sung more songs together. the first couple of songs they do sing together, but after like track 4, they are taking turns singing. Like I said, if you like the songs, and would love to hear them acoustic with 2 masters of country music, then this CD is a great buy... but if you were hoping for a CD full of duets by the 2, its a let down.For me this product was a let down, but I was under the impression that it was johnny and willie singing together the entire CD. I did give it 4 stars, because quality-wise, its excellent. Music wise, its excellent. I love the songs, I just thought it was going to be more of both singing together. So be forewarned, most of the CD are johnny and willie singing independently."
3,It helps but,It does help reduce my pain level. But it is kinda hard to put on and keep in the proper place and is a little bulky under clothing.
4,I like it you should get it for your groin,I like it you should get it for your groin fit good it does help with my injury for the groin
3,It did not work for me but the product is not the problem,"It did not work as I was specting of. I believe I have to purchase another kind of hip bend because I have a problem in my hip. I believe it does not have to see with this good product.Regards,Juan"
3,Only comes in One-size,I am not sure yet if I will keep this product. I am still trying to figure out how to wrap it properly...I think the one size may be too large for me. I wonder if others have had this experience?
1,Smelly,This wrap smelled like rubber tires and was impossible to use. It must be really hot in the Summer. I would try something else if you live in the Heat like I do.
3,Not for slender,"I got this to help with the pain of a chronic groin pull. It helps when it is pulled tight and you first start your activity. Unfortunately, it slips out of place within the first five minutes of moving in it. Then you have to put it back on, starting from the initial placement, which makes any sustained activity impossible. I am a tall but slender woman, so maybe it fits better on a larger body shape. I've tried it for tennis, hiking and yoga, and it's not worth the hassle."
3,ok,"The product seemed to help a little. However, it was difficult to wear in the heat of summer. The brace produced lots of sweating and a uncomfortable situation."
2,it's ok,I purchased this to help support my hip that I have chronic pain issues with after a hip replacement.I bought it with the intentions of being to wear it either over or under my work pants at my job to give me standing support. It worked fine for about a few days then it started to unravel or just come lose durning my work day. this is probably best to use at home where you can wear shorts or sweatpants. Not a reliable support for someone whom is somewhat active or just running errands. Would be better off using a cane or walker for support.
1,Not worth it,"I couldn't get it to stay on, couldn't walk in it, there were no clear instructions. It was a big old waste of money. Compression shorts work better (because they stay on) and are less expensive."
4,Yummy Mint choco chips for baking,"these mint chocolate chips are tasty, easy to use. I baked them into cookies and had MANY compliments. A little expensive, but very good flavor."
5,Mint chips well worth the money.,"I bought these chips, happy to have found them through Amazon. It used to be easy to find mint chips in the stores, but they don't seem available any more.These chips are the perfect size and flavor for the cookies I use them in. I was very pleased with them, and recommend them highly, I will certainly buy them again next year, since it is a Christmas cookie I put them in. The price was well worth it, for the quality and amount of chips in the package.Never hurts to check Amazon for this sort of random thing!"
5,Mint CHocolate chips,I received them VERY fast. They were not melted or in any other way not in perfect condition. I will definitely order for this vendor again.
5,Perfect Mint chocolate chips.,After trying every grocery store in the area I turned to Amazon.com and found these chocolate chips. They were fresh and had the perfect taste and size for my cookies. They were delivered exactly on time and wrapped very well. I will use this company again.
5,This ones great,"Although I don't think the little touch books are very durable, this one has great appeal to my little guy. He is 15 months old, and started doing all the animal sounds. This is a great book because it has real photo's, not cartoons. He loves this one!"
2,Strange selection of animals,"Neighborhood animals and even basic zoo animals should be prevalent in this book to help small children learn and associate with the real world they will see. But this book has rare birds, ""outback"" animals and others...would have been better with a better mix of animals that included regular birds, dogs, cats, elephants etc...again things a child will see in the neighborhood or at the zoo."
5,Must have if you are a Little Touch Leap Pad fan,"This ""Animal World"" software keeps my 18 month old toddler entertained even if she forgets to push ""Go"". So what if the elephant is making a meowing sound if she forgets to push ""Go"". It keeps her laughing."
4,"Swell, swell, swell","While some of the songs on this CD drag on too long, they're still enjoyable, and fairly-well mixed. I love the mix on this album of ""Always on My Mind/In my House."" Powerful and dramatic. This is a better than average PSB production."
3,Overpriced,"You can get Pet Shop Boys albums with two or three times as many songs for a dollar or two less than this. Do it.Good music, though."
3,OK,"There is one problem with this item, when it gets cold out, the battery stops working, so early season this isn't great.."
5,Easy to set up. Works.,"I lost all of my parsley, beans, squash and zucchs to an obnoxious rabbit, and when the raccoons started taking the tomatoes, I'd had enough. I am completely unfamiliar with anything related to wiring, but I had no problem setting this up. It took about 45 minutes for me to set it around my 10x5 garden. I have relied on the tester that is included to tell me it's working. There is an audible beep and flashing light when the unit is on. I like that there is an on/off switch right on the front of the unit so I can turn the fence off in the morning before the kids come out to play, and turn it back on at dusk. So far, the garden has not been touched by coon, bun or deer. Very pleased with this unit."
2,Doesn't keep groundhog out,I bought this for my veggie garden to keep a nearby ground hog out. It is set up properly (we are horse owners and have electrical fencing) and it just doesn't do the job. The shock isn't strong enough (brand new batteries) and he knows to run through it quickly to avoid a shock. It does work for the dog though - but it doesn't take much for her.
1,Don't trust Amazon!,"As usual, Amazon quickly shipped this product. However, when opening the package it was VERY CLEAR that this was a return from a previous buyer. The covering plastic was stapled together, not form-fitting as when new. Also, the electrical unit has a broken connector. The damage is not fatal and not worth the hassle of returning, but I bought ""new"", not ""reconditioned"" merchandise.I'm very disappointed in Amazon."
4,"Have the LP, the CD is a welcome addition","Having a commercial CD with this music means I don't have go through the process of creating a CD from the LP. The sound is smooth, and almost syrupy sweet, but I like the selection of tunes and the arrangements."
2,Strawberry Shortcake Icing Color Set,This was not the icing set I got. It was in a green box and the colors were a little old.
4,great bandage,"I use plaster bandages for Mother Molds. a rigid mold to hold a softer pliable molds in place, typically either Alginate for life-casting, or rubber for other molds.Mostly for life casting though, and heres why. the plaster is thick and creamy, not chunky and spotty like cheaper plaster bandages, or god help you, Craft Bandages. i can create a rigid and supportive mother mold in two layers and it sets up firm and quick.on the off chance you are doing life-casting, this is a good product."
5,A Romance Novel for Worldly Women,"If you like Danielle Steel, you'll love Elaine Gordon's book, Intimate Terms. It's provocative, fun, sexy and romantic. A great read--I could not put it down. Characters are intense and interesting (stranger than fiction), and the dialogue is excellent. A wonderful read."
3,Addicted to Lucky,"I love the series. Once you become a Lucky fan, you hope the stories just keep coming. Totally hooked. Loved the story and loved the story line"
4,NYHC,"This is a good cd from a NYHC band with a new kind of twist. They have a different style with their guitars but it is a hard cd with many parts to mosh to. This cd has the songs from their other cd ""Strictly the Real"" and some new songs. Guest vocals on the songs ""Fake Smile"" by Joe Krazy, Freddy Madball, and Boston Mike and on the song ""Fall Out"" from Freddy Madball and Danny Diablo (Lord Ezec vocalist from Crown of Thornz and Skarhead)"
1,Not worth the money,After receiving this product I was very disappointed in how cheaply it was made. The alarm was not very loud and it was just not worth the money they were charging. I returned it as this was a gift for my mother-in-law and I wsa not about to give this to her. I really think this was overpriced.
1,Rip off,I never received this product that I paid for. Thanks for proving my wife's point. I will no longer order products from this site.
5,Your best shot at The Complete Sibelius Symphonies,"I have for decades listend to various recordings of these symphonies. Favorites come and go, but The Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra, with Saraste at the helm, always comes back with a vengeance. This set is simply the most satisfying rendition in my book. Brisk, but true to Sibelius' score. Superb sonics thanks to the famous Philharmonia Hall in St. Petersburg. Live recordings, as in this case, often add to the sence of authenticity. Sadly, Finlandia Records is history. The recordings can be purchased from another label, but if you can get your hands on this nice box-set from Finlandia, don't think twice. Visually the rereleases are very dull, the sonics I know nothing about."
5,complete and ambiant,"Comnplete and ambiant recording. The book shows much information, perhaps too much. There is always something for everyone in this recording"
2,looks great - poor fit,"I recently purchased the Taylor Made package that included socket, flag pole, and flag. While all of the individual pieces seem to be good quality the flag pole sits very loosely in the socket. The instructions suggest that when mounting the flag pole in a 3/4-inch socket you need to cut off a bottom section of the flag pole. This clearly will not fix the problem as the flag pole already rests on the lip of the socket without needing to be shortened. Ultimately I went to office max and purchased a box of rubber finger protectors and was able to cut one to fit on the bottom of the flag pole and create a tight fit.Overall this is a great looking product that is very poorly designed."
5,MAHOGANY BOAT FLAG POLE IS VERY HIGH QUALITY!,"I must say I was apprehensive when I made this purchase. I really did not think I would be receiving the high quality product that I did get when it was delivered. Fine, flawless mahogany you do not see very often anymore with a beautiful satin finish that will last season after season. You will not go wrong by ordering this flag pole for your boat!"
2,Not all it's cracked up to be,"I bought this instead of a cheaper model because of the second smaller disc that will supposedly clean a Gamecube laser lens. Unfortunately, the Gamecube (at least mine) doesn't recognize the disc, so it's worthless."
3,eerily prescient,"a generation later the concept of middle east terrorists using an air attack on an iconic american building doesnt seem as far fetched as it did in 1977, does it? robert shaw is at the peak of his popularity (this was just 2 years post ""jaws""), and bruce dern is his usual crazy villain, but sadly the copy of the dvd i had crimped marthe kellers frontal nudity scene. ka-BOOM!!!"
5,Can this picture really be 25 Years Old?,"So vastly underrated and never appreciated, this is one movie that I've touted for years as the best of its kind. Thomas Harris was years ahead of his time in writing a story that is as timely as tomorrow's headlines. The storyline is solid, the acting is superb(with maybe the exception of Marthe Keller). I've had copies of this on VHS for years and now finally have the pleasure of owning it on DVD in widescreen. Only now, in post 9/11 America, will viewers come to realize that although a work of fiction, the threat that it presents is very real. Its horror all too possible. The monsters depicted exist. A very powerful and disturbing movie with scenes that will burn their way into your mind forever. The action is unrelenting and you are placed on the edge of your seat from start to finish. This movie is in my top five favorites of all time. Robert Shaw's best work."
1,GENERIC,"A box office flop when it came out, and forgotten now, though the book was from the author of SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, this movie is just another middle east terrorist story mixed with the cliched crazy Vietnam vet. Nothing special about the action, or acting.The lead-up is more interesting than the climax! It's not enough that tens of thousands of Americans might die, 10 times as many as with 911, so the movie has President Carter show up at the football game, to make the terrorists really seem bad!Not exactly boring, there are enough action scenes, it's just that the overall movie is so uninspired. TWO MINUTE WARNING, another football terrorist movie, came out about 6 months before BLACK SUNDAY, and has a better cast, partly cause it's treated like some 70s disaster movie."
4,Action Movie that is still Timely,"Some movies show their age shortly after they were made. This is one that was written by Thomas Harris that is still timely. At the time it was fresh to the terrorist taking over the Olympics, but now it seems timely because of the activities in the Middle East. Robert Shaw and Bruce Dern especially turn in fine performances. The support cast is good as well. The music by John Williams is good as always. The addition of shots of the real Goodyear blimp and the Superbowl X game add to the believability. We even see Terry Bradshaw, Roger Staughbach, and the other real players for the Pittsburgh Steelers and Dallas Cowboys. During the scene where the people stampede, you may find yourself mooing. Fans of ""Two Minute Warning"" should love it. I bought this since it is still a good movie and the price is great. Not much in the way of extras, but excellent picture and sound quality."
5,On the Horn by Paul Taylor,"I think this cd is absolutely fantastic!! I loved every track & ""Til We Meet Again"" is my favorite."
5,One of the Best Angelic layers,"This Angelic layers is one of the funniest and one of the most action-packed Angelic layers. I very Highly reccomend this to anyone, just get the first one along with it though or you may have to read it a few times before you get who everybody is."
5,Psychedelic techno masterpiece!!,"This was supposedly recorded in a weekend, in classic jam spirit with each member 'feeding of each others' energies and ideas.' The result is a dense, druggy complicated mix of a few core analog synthesizers twisting and melting, overlapping and fading in and out of each other. The sequences and patterns these three guys come up with are consistently inventive and the tweakage is intense and fluid-2nd to none. Though they continued to work this way live, they largely abandoned this free-form acid techno jam style in favor of more straighforward techno trax on the subsequent albums. In techno, there are so few interesting full albums, so few real masterpieces, but this is definitely one of them."
4,Brandenburg concertos,"It is a good recording from a good performers. Not sure if like concertos itself. It is a third and likely last attempt to understand why these concertos are so highly valued by the other people. There are some really good pieces of music, but not as good as let's say similar Orchestral Suites by the same ABO and Koopman."
4,Best of Roxette!,"I first got to know Roxette when I in high school and they became one of few of the foreign pop singers I am fond of (I am a native Chinese myself) and I tried to buy their albums dispite being poor at that time. Personally I feel Look Sharp is the best of Roxette. Roxette are good for their early works and became affected in late songs, whcih is made obvious in ""Crash, Boom, Bang"". My favourite songs of Roxette are ""Fading like a flower"", ""It must have been love""and ""listen to your heart"". If you want to get the real flavor of Roxette, buy this one and Tourism."
5,Roxette look sharp!,"This Roxette CD got some radio play in '88. 'Dangerous', 'Listen to your heart', and 'The look' were what was playing in Austin Tx. However 'Half a woman half a shadow' and 'Paint' are also good songs and deserve your ear. 'Dangerous' was my girlfriend and I's song back in 1990. It's upbeat rhythm reflected how we felt when we were out and about with each other. There was also a 12"" remix of 'Dangerous' that is quite good, although hard to find. If you find it, definitely get it. The music videos of 'Dangerous' and 'The Look', available on iTunes, are worth the purchase. Both are well done."
2,Expected Better Shipping,"Two reasons why I ordered this CD from Amazon: I couldn't find it anywhere else & I was told it would ship fast. Ha! I ordered it on Dec 5, 2011 and my email that confirmed it shipped said I should expect it on Dec 10. Never came. In fact, it never came until Dec 22, a full 2 1/2 weeks after I ordered it, and a week after the Christmas party I wanted to give it at. The CD works great but I was definitely disapointed in the shipping. Going to do a little more research before ordering from this website again."
2,This Album Gave Me Tuberculosis,"I admit I should have researched this album much more before committing to purchasing it, but that doesn't change the fact that it's awful. I thought I liked Roxette. Not only was I horribly mistaken, but I now have TB."
4,Great protection for your Hilites,"These 6"" stone guards are great protection for my 6"" daylighters. They snap on and fit pretty snug so they won't come loose, even with heavy shaking and rattling.Beware, though, that the KC logo is much larger than pictured in the item photo. It actually covers most of the front surface of the shield. It will not, however, diminish light output from these lamps."
5,A view from the field,As a war veteran U.S. Grant's memoir just rocked me. I loved Shelby Foote's the Civil War for a broder view but to see the war through Grant's eyes. Amazing.
2,Marketing Fluff!,"It's pretty and colorful and has more sidebars than text. It starts with a ten page ""why this book is great"" embedded review and continues making it pretty throughout the book.But there is no content. The basic form of the book is to define a few terms, define a chart, have some barely related case study, go to the next chapter. It's an easy book to teach from, but a horrible book to learn from. For example, it brings up the four P's (Place, Promotion, Price, Product) with a paragraph or two for each. It completely misses the idea that place might have changed from this new Internet thing. Another book might mention how a major online retailer might immediately give you 25% ACD (All Commodity Distribution %) or discuss the importance of WalMart and mass retailers. This book just blithy continues on, secure in the knowledge that you know the definition for the test.The whole book is written as if you purchased a set of flashcards."
1,Marketing,"I haven't received the book yet. It was ordered about a month ago. I'm in week two of the MBA class six week course and hope it will arrive soon.ps I had to click on a star to submit this review, even thought it does not earn a star rating at this time."
4,College textbook for domestic Marketing,"This book is good at presenting how to put together a marketing plan. I just wish it was not so wordy in some parts, but the information is helpful."
3,marketing...ughhh,"Hey, a book about selling stuff. I wonder how many buzz words it has.... SPOILER: this book has thousands of silly words in it for common sense things. But that's marketing. Common sense. This book does a decent job teaching it, but is very, very, drawn out."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS [game],"All you do in this game is run errands for people! Who likes to run errands? NO one! Good cartoon, BAAAAAD game."
2,a short and boring game!!!!,this is a very short game. its also very confusing. example: you get something from larry but you have to do something to get it than you give it to squidward who gives you something to give to someone else who needs you to do something for him to give it or get it. dosnt make sense its too boring and typical. trough the whole game you just try to get one thing but you do a million things to get it than you go to chapter 2 and that is it. i finished it in 1:30 minutes or less its easy boring short and confusing and dosnt have a main point. dont buy it!!!!!
1,Too Short,"We bought this for our 7 year old daughter, and she did become interested but she finished the game in 25 minutes. We couldn't believe it when she said she was finished and it had been that short of a time period. There was nothing else to do on the game after she conquered it. I really feel it was a waste of money. I thought it would keep her occupied for awhile, it only had one quest which was very short....not recommended for the price."
4,Kids love it!,"The kids liked this game so much, that when it turned up lost, they insisted on a getting it again!"
2,Gay Bashing Book,"After I finished this book, I realized how furious it left me. It seemed to be derogatory towards gays, in the way that Noli (the female character) despised T.J. after she found out that he was gay. She uses derogatory terms towards him, and declares herself the enemy of T.J. and his new boyfriend. She is thoroughly selfish, and turns against him because she wanted to be his lover, and couldn't because he is gay. She didn't seem to understand what that meant. As a gay activist, and always looking out for the feelings of gays, I would have to say that this book does more harm to the reader then good."
1,Whistle Me Home,"This book was ok. It was definitely not the best book ever. It had surprising elements, but the characters were dull. I wouldn't recommend to anyone who doesn't like to read. Find something else!"
1,NO! NO! Don't listen to them! This book is TERRIBLE!,"This book is not a ""romantic story with a twist"" it's not anything good. Forget that's it's a gay bashing book, forget that the main character is an alcoholic who is like totally harsh. It's BORING. It's poorly written. The theme could have produced a really excellent book, but it fell way short. There's no compassion on Nolie's part, and even TJ isn't so great, though I naturally feel for him a bit more than her. Please believe me, it's a bad book. Don't waste your money, in fact don't even waste your time. I wouldn't even reccommend you take it out of the library. It has no redeeming qualities, the only nice thing I can say about it is, it has a decent cover. Beware. P.S, I didn't want to give it one star, I wanted to give it MINUS stars, but apparently you're required to give a book at least one. So a pity star for Whistle me Home."
3,Excellent socks for 6 months,"After owning merino wool socks for 12 months, I have become a huge fan. For cold mornings, or during autumn and winter they are the best socks to wear. Also very comfortable on long walks. These Wigwarm's are also good value.Good socks, but when worn often they don't last. The sole gets thin and holes appear. My next socks to try are going to be Darn Tough."
2,"XL 13-15 Shrinks, too tight fit for me on 13 foot","XL 13-15 Shrinks, too tight fit for me on 13 foot, cuts down blood circulation. Might be what some customers want. Can't imagine getting it on a 15 foot after couple of washings. I did not use dryer. Wish they made a XXL 17-20. That might work for my desired comfort."
5,Warm,These socks kept my feet warm during about 3 hours of skiing (and falling) Would highly recommend for winter wear.
4,super warm - a little tight,"I have always liked Wigwam socks and these keep up the tradition of not disappointing me. They are super warm and thick as well, so I think they'll hold up fairly well even after a lot of washings.The only semi-problem (but not really) is that they're quite tight. I know after several wears and washings they'll probably loosen up a lot, but new they are somewhat constricting on the blood flow. I'm diabetic but the tightness isn't a real issue for me, just mentioning it in case some of you prefer looser socks or have circulation problems."
3,Warm but not Durable,"These are very warm but after wearing them for only two uses, one had a hole in it. I would expect better quality for the cost of them, but they are still a good winter sock."
5,Warm & Comfortable,These socks are comfortable and have snug fit. There is no discernable seams in the toe area to cause any extra pressure on the toes. Thanks to the 50 degree February weather I can't say how warm they are in super cold weather but they have been comforable so far.
5,Super Socks,"Very comfortable, hate to take them off. Made in USA makes them feel even better. Wigwam socks are now the only ones for me."
4,"Soft, Nice Socks","Desirably soft, warm, comfortable socks. Get dirty easily, but that's expected. Good color and look. Very warm, often even when wet."
5,Keep your feet warm.,"These socks keep your feet warm! I always thought of wool as scratchy and not very comfortable, but that is certainly not the case with these socks! The Wigwam Merino Wool socks are actually quite soft, and feel good on your feet. I ordered the large size as I wear about a 12 size shoe, and I feel as though they fit very well!I wear these with my merrell boots and I don't think it's even possible for my feet to get cold. If you're out in the cold at all, I'd recommend these socks.Just take care when you wash them, and these seems like they'll last quite a while!"
3,"Great socks, bad company/service","I will start by saying these socks are amazing. Long lasting, extremely comfortable, great for hiking and great combatants against sweaty feetBUT, the service was disappointing. Not blaming Amazon, they came on time and everything. However, upon arrival one of the socks had a quarter size hole In the toe. Very frustrating to get an item damaged especially when heading off for a backpacking trip a day after arrival. No time to exchange the socks for new ones, though a quick sew did the trick.Don't let the service stray away from buying the socks. The socks are well worth the very small risk of having the same thing that happened to me happen to you."
4,Good material but poor fit for me,"Wigwam Unisex Merino Wool Comfort Hiker Crew Length 2-Pack SocksThe material is very good. However the cut is not for women, the toes are is cut flat instead of slanted for women fit. It is big for my shoe size 4.5 as extra fabric at the smallest 2 toes. Plan to call Wigwam to consult if Women socks would fit better if a different cut than this unisex sock"
4,Great socks,"They have lots of cushioning and are very warm -- ideal for frigid winter walks. Also, they hug my feet nicely, giving a little bit of a massage."
4,Too tight around the calves,"Maybe it's just me, but as comfortable as these socks are, they are very tight around the calves area. I have really skinny legs and I thought I wouldn't have any problems with this pair. I was wrong.Wigwam is a great brand but I'm sensitive to any tight jeans or socks around my legs. So I purchased Wigwam Women's Merino Wool Cushioned Quarter Socks instead. They don't cut off the blood circulation in my leg and they are just as warm and comfortable.If you're not bothered by tight fit clothing than this pair of socks might work great for you. They are soft, cushioning, and warm. Great ventilation too for my feet. If I was going skiing, I would wear these socks, just because I don't want them slipping off my calves while I'm moving around. Other than that, for my regular day-to-day uses, I would wear the quarter socks instead."
5,Perfect for picky husband!,My husband is very picky with almost everything and he loves these socks! They breathe well and are very comfortable. Perfect for winter time!
1,These socks Shrink,Part of buying a sock is so that you can wear it for a long period of time. These socks shrink. Nothing worse than a sock shrinking and you have to stretch it out before you wear it or it cuts the circulation off above the ankle.Thumbs down!
5,Just a good book,"What more can you say? It's well-written. It's smart, fun, and entertaining. Being from (or familiar with) the places she uses for her backdrop is a plus, but it is certainly not necessary to enjoy this gem."
5,An Enchanting Story,"Joyce Sterling-Scarbrough has given us a trip back to the bitter-sweet times of reaching out for maturity, the agony and ecstacy of the teen-years.Her characters are solid and the plot is alluring.A really entertaining story to read. Be sure you read it!"
5,Couldn't put this down!,"This book has humor, drama, an engaging heorine and a hunky hero that rival many a romance novel I have read. The author weaves a tale of young love, troubled teens, class clowns and mixes in the culture of the late 70's to bring together a recipe for a fabulous novel that transends genre and category for an enjoyable story that will make you cry, laugh, and wish to be young all over again."
2,Tether strap difficult to tighten,"I bought this car seat because I thought it had all of the features that I wanted. What I found is that Cosco has a different kind of tether latch for the rear hook that is much more difficult to adjust than other seats. I have to do it manually instead of just pulling on the strap the way I have done previously with Graco, for example. The tether system for the bottom hooks are uncomfortable to tighten as well and the seat does not remain in place as one would hope. I use it without the base as suggested by the worker from Babies 'R Us who installed it the first time. It sits much too high with the base in. Other than that it is a comfortable seat. Not one that you would want to buy if you ever need to remove and reinstall. I will be replacing it soon and feel that it was a waste of money"
1,Forward facing only seat!,Just wanted to mention that I saw in at least one previous post a person mention that this seat can be used rearfacing and I wanted to be sure to clarify for everyone that this seat is for FORWARD FACING only!
1,nightmare to get child into seat,"What a pain! Takes so long to get our 2 year old into the seat, haggling with the straps and the complicated, two part buckle. During the recent cold spell we almost froze ourselves and her trying to get her into the thing. We regret buying this thing and may look for another seat."
1,I do not like this seat!,"I researched this seat for about a month before I finally bought it. I have had it for almost a year and hate it! If I could give it a lower rating, I would. The straps are always twisting, it is hard to adjust the straps, and my son can't buckle himself in. Plus, I can't fit any other car seats next to it in my car, because it is so huge! I will be ditching this seat and buying a new one as soon as I can."
4,I love it,"I bought this car seat in 2003 for my son, who was just turning one. It was easy to install, I do not have latch, so i used the seat belt. I love the recline option, his little head didnt slump forward. It is kinda a pain in the rear to take the cover off, but it's not to difficult. I have the hang of it now, and it only takes about 2-3 minutes to take it off completely. The only thing I dont like about it is the fact that the child has to be forward facing, it would be nice if it had a rear facing option. My daughter is 9 months old and too big for a infant carrier but not big enough for a forward facing car seat. So I'm not left with to many options. Overall I think its worth the $"
3,Not for tall kids under 4,"While I think this is a really good choice for most people, I would like to point out that it is not an ideal choice for families with very tall kids. The 5-pt harness is only good for kids up to 40 inches in height, after that you need to use the seat as a belt-positioning booster. This is not a problem for most people, but if you have a very tall kid like my son (who was over 40 inches at his 3rd birthday), you will be better off getting something else like a Britax Marathon or a Husky because all of the safety organizations strongly recommend that you do NOT put a child under 4 yrs of age in a belt-positioning booster. The Summit is actually one of the shorter seats if you measure the distance from the seat to the top slot. The top slot cannot be used with the harness (per the mfr's instructions), so you only have 3 positions to put the straps before you run out of room. Hope this helps!"
1,Please read before buying!,"I think it is amazing that I wrote a review on this carseat and they didn't submit it. Maybe it is because they don't want you to know the information that I provided. Im a concerned mom that goes to the extreme when it comes to safety and my children and I just wanted everyone to know that I spoke with Century (makes this carseat) and I also spoke with all the safety numbers that are printed on the seat because I was concerned why the seat would not fit in my Expedition correctly. They informed me that the seat is not made for SUV's and you can't use them in an SUV because of the base, therefore it is not safe to use in an SUV. They have not printed this on the box, because their sales will go down. Please do not remove this message. Im only concerned about safety of children, not the sale of this product. Thanks"
1,Just have a look at ALL the seats before choosing this one,"This seat has to be the most frustrating seat EVER created and I wish now that I had taken more time when I was choosing. The hassle I have with it is the clip on the seat belt, it is like a puzzle and is so annoying, my 5yr old gets stressed out every time she has to do as it takes such concentration and is just a total pain. I cannot tell you how many tears and stressed out times we have had trying to get her into this seat, the Graco I have in my other vehicle is such a breeze and she can clip herself in everytime without a fuss. The one star is ONLY for that it sits up higher allowing her to see out the window really nicely. DO NOT BUY THIS SEAT unless they have changed the clip on the belt by now."
2,Disappointed!,This car seat does nothing but swallow up my daughter. She is 14 months and I keep thinking that she will grow into it. Well I just wonder how much longer I will have to wait!
1,Inconvenient,You do not attach the base of this car seat to the vehicle. It does notwork like an infant seat. It would be difficult to take the base on andoff each time you moved the car seat. It would be very time consumingandwould be pointless to do so.
4,Great Consumer Report and I'm buying another one.,"My 2.5 yr old has been using it fine with the exception of the straps not staying flat. Easy to wash. The headreast is useless but we use a neck pillow and recline the seat and it's great. She feels very independant, i.e. cup holder, arm rests up or down, recline. Great color, doesn't show dirt.I have a 9 mo. old and I will be getting another identical Summit seat for her. I trust it. The Consumer Report says that out of all the 3-n-1 or infant-toddler seats, this is the ONLY one that does a decent job of all functions.Hope this helps.Happy Mom of Hannah and Elisabeth in OR."
5,less than $100 for a seat that will last 5+ years,"I initially perchased this seat because both of my convertible seats were in an accident so I had to turn them in to my insurance company. After I got the seat, I realized what great features it has (recline, cup holder, moveable armrests, adjustables shoulders straps, and it works well with seatbelt installation). It is also the only booster seat recommended by Consumer Reports. It makes me feel great to know my child is well protected And I got a great deal. PLUS my son loves his new seat so much he rarely fusses when I put him in it."
3,It's an ok seat....,"I bought this seat after my reached the weight and height requirements. He was about 1 1/2 when we started using it. He's now going to be three and we still us it. The seat is sturdy enough, the car seat cover is easy to remove and comes clean easily. I have only two complaints about the seat...one is the size of the seat with the base. It's not an easy seat to get in and out of a car. The second complaint is that I had a hard time with the seat straps, they always were twisted. Overall this seat is good.Was it worth the money? I would problably say yes...we've had it along time, and have gotten our money out of it."
1,No good for 30-40lb children,I was really dissatisfied with this product. The 5 point harness straps are flimsy and twist all up. The latch & rear tether straps are virtually impossible to get tight because of the buckle mechanism. The drink holder is unreachable for a 5 point harness strapped in child. The harness tightener never seemed to get tight enough (2 fingers under chest). The recline is good but moves the booster seat way out on the end of the car's seat. Returned it! Bought a Graco Platinum - LOVE IT!
2,Tangled straps,I bought this for my 3 year old and I owuld never buy it again. The straps are forever getting tangled which makes it very hard to buckle the child in. Plus the place where you snap the buckles into is always getting jammed. I would not recommend this car seat
2,hated taking the cover off to wash.,I love the carseat for my daughter. However I almost broke the thing while taking off the cover to wash it. I also had a hard getting the cover back on. I love the way the seat buckles and I feel very safe with my daughter riding in it but I hope that it stays clean enough not to have to wash the cover again for a while!
2,Uggggh ... the straps,After much research we purchased this seat hoping it would last our daughter until she no longer had need for a seat. We've had the seat for a year and overall find it sufficient. We are currently looking to replace this seat though because the straps get so easily twisted and make it VERY difficult to tighten them!!! The cup holder is also out of reach for little arms.
5,Wonderful comfortable seat,"We purchased this seat after researching many consumer reports. We plan to use it as a booster seat when our son weighs 40 pounds.I read reviews before purchase of those complaining of twisted straps. This has NEVER been an issue for us.We DO NOT have this problem. Yes, the seat is a little bigger/taller than you would expect, but big deal. If fits very well in our Chevy Tahoe and Ford crewcab. We bought it before our vacation. A 10 hour drive. (I thought this would be a good test to see how well it worked for us) Our son ( 4 yrs. old)never complained about it and it was comfortable for him to sleep in. He loves to raise and lower his own armrests. Perhaps a 2 year old isn't quite ready for a seat of this nature. This was a excellent buy with no regrets. And believe me, I am picky about my children's car seats."
2,"Great idea, but uncomfortable",This car seat features look great but the back of our son's thigh turned red and complained that it hurts when he's riding in it. (Maybe thicker paddings may help.)
2,Must Use Base With This Carseat!,"A little known fact of this car seat compared to the Alpha Omega is that you must use the base (verified via phone by Cosco). It is a good seat if you can use the base, but if you have bucket type seats in your car, or leather, I would not purchase this seat (the sides dig into the leather). Spend the extra $ and go for the Alpha Omega!"
1,Unhappy with the belts...,"I bought this seat for my daughter when she was 3 1/2. The belts are thin and twist so easily, they are thin and cheap. the little plastic latch broke in less than a year and had to be replaced. The seat she graduated out of had belts 1000X better, they were as thick as regular seat belts in your car and never twist. I really wish I had paid better attention to this when buying it b/c now I am in the market for a better one. Also it is very tall and is taller than my back seat (we have a Dodge Durango). I think it looks tacky, which is not very important, but I will be paying attention to this feature also as I fork out another 100+ bucks for a seat that is worth my child sitting it."
3,How DO YOU wash it?,"I've had this seat for almost 2 years. My son is about to turn four. I've had the twisty strap problem, the non head support, and the too little padding problem.Solutions:* Be patient with the straps. My vehicle's own seatbelts twist too!* Put 3 diapers in the lower back portion for more padding. Works beautifully.* Use a baby neck pillow and a removable headrest from another car seat to keep his head up.I just tried to wash the seat, but could not figure out how to get the cover off. I'd give it a 4 if I could do that easier. I saw a reviewer who mentioned that was easy, but I found it impossible! What am I doing wrong?"
4,Great for the $$,"We bought this for our 1 year old daughter and love it. She seems very comfortable in the car seat. It reclines easily and she is able to sleep in it without seeming uncomfortable. The one hand adjustable strap is great, with changing weather it is great to be able to adjust the strap with coats and sweaters. We have been through 5 car seats between the two girl and this by far is our favorite. We love it so much we are going to replace our 3 year old daughter's car seat with this same car seat. The only reason it didn't get a 5 was the straps do tend to become twisted, but that is something I can live with in a seat."
1,it is a big deal if the straps get twisted!,"I bought this car seat for my son several months ago. After continuously trying to keep the straps from twisting we tried using it as a booster seat. He is 35lbs but only 26 months and too immature for that so I am going to buy a britax marathon. The straps twisting is a big deal because if you are in an accident and they are twisted they act as a rope and cut your child. They dont twist in all car seats. I have never had this problem with our fisher price seat.. ever. Thicker straps dont twist. The other thing about this seat is I have never been able to get it tight in any car with the seatbelt only. It does very well with the LATCH. Oh yes, and the tether is a pain in the rear to tighten. It takes forever and is unneccesarily difficult."
3,Good seat for the money.,"Like other reviews, I noticed the Consumer Reports evaluation of this seat. My wife had already purchased the seat to give our oldest daughter room to grow (she is now three). I had a terrible time with the straps twisting, the material just seemed to thin. With my schedule, I didn't have the time to untwist until I put her in the car. She often found the straps uncomfortable.To be fair to Consumer Reports, they only gave it a top rating as a booster seat. Of the ones that they tested, it performed the best as a booster, it held onto the seatbelt better than the rest.We are keeping it for use as a booster, but will probably look for a different brand for our youngest as the straps twist. Since my oldest loved to help buckling herself in, it was often difficult to accomplish. She got pretty good, but the twisted straps made the tension difficult to connect to the buckle without loosening every time."
4,READ BEFORE YOU BUY !!!,"I am amazed that this car seat passed safety inspections! I would give it ZERO stars, but the system will not accept less than one star. Maybe this car seat works just fine in other car models, but not either of ours. First of all, the base is so big that it would hang off the front of the seat (even in our SUV!). Forget about reclining it. That pushes it even further off the seat cushion. But the major problem with this seat is that the hole you feed the seat belt or LATCH through is higher up on the back of the car seat. This acts as an unbalanced fulcrum so that if you pull from the front of the car seat it slips forward and tilts back causing all straps to loosen. I read one review where someone else had the same problem, so I am not alone. Good ratings or no, this seat is back in the box and heading back to the store."
3,"This is a good idea -- however, I ...","This is a good idea -- however, I found that the white substance doesn't stay under my nails very long. I'd recommend applying it for an evening or special event only. It does look very nice for a short period of time. I don't think it would stay very long in a wet environment."
3,This product does what its name implies. It ...,"This product does what its name implies. It whitens the nails and gives the appearance of a French manicure. Once you wash your hands you must re-apply the product. I think overall this is a nice little product for those who need to have nice-looking hands, for the job and so on. As long as you have access to water in order to get your nails wet, you can apply this anywhere. There's no bad smell left behind as in the case of nail polish."
4,I couldn't get the pencil to work at ...,"I couldn't get the pencil to work at first, then followed the directions of soaking my fingertips in warm water for about a minute. That made a big difference. The nail whitener pencil makes the tips of my nails white and well defined. It also survived many hand washings without wearing off. I like this pencil; it's easy to use and does what it says it will!"
3,I thought this product was a great idea ...,"I thought this product was a great idea -- I love French Manicures, and this seemed like a really easy way to get them at home. However, I thought that the pencil was a little too 'hard' -- meaning that it was great at cleaning out under my nails, but not much of the white color stuck to the nail itself."
4,My daughter and I enjoyed this product. It ...,"My daughter and I enjoyed this product. It was easy to use and gave the illusion of a French manicure without the time or expense of a salon visit. The fact that it would also just wash off kept the nails neat without the peeling polish look. Low cost, low maintenance, and high-fashion look -- I like it!"
1,BAD MOVIE,"The previous review mentions much of what I would say, except that it becomes clear with about 40 mins ( and that is still a lot of time )left that this movie is totally lost. You hold on for a intelligent resolution that could have happened but is a mess. That leaves only that this is a misleading and quite bad movie on all counts. There's even mention of werewolves without any story reasoning. Worse a brother sister rape, and late needless swearing that only adds to the sadness of this broken story. Buy, no. Rent, you could do worse but you will be throwing away money."
2,Too expensive,The finish on the watch and band is cheap. The latch on the band pops off every time you bend your wrist back. The watch is useless in the dark. It's a $20 watch at best.
2,Not a bright glow,"It is either this watch does not have tritium or the tritium glow is quite weak. I got the watch and tested it in the dark, it was not brighter than my Casio watch."
1,Didn't work,"I received the watch and it didnt work , figured it was the battery so I took it for a new battery and the jeweler said the battery was fine and that it might be the coil or entire insides....very disappointed , I hope they make guns better than they do watches"
2,"Good watch, Cheap Band","This watch is great except the finish on the band wears off extremely fast. I have worn mone for about 2 weeks and the band shows extreme signs of wear. This is the second one of these I have had, and the problem exists with both of them."
1,Retro lover,"An okay, but dated text on midcentury modern. Fabbro has the knowledge of the period needed to construct these books, but the designs are really very clumbersome pieces that suit your grandparents' period. If you're looking for something more bachelor pad-like, this is definitely not it."
5,Brings joy of Christmas to '60s burnouts.,"If the ""A Very Special Christmas"" trilogy were to add a forth, this should be it. The execution and selection is supurb. You'll be humming these tunes as you stroll the Malls, the benificiaries will be the receivers of your gifts. ""A Christmas To Remember"" is, indeed, unforgetable and a gift to all who listen to it."
4,Enchanting Signs and sounds,"If you have not heard of Compost Records by now then this album is a perfect introduction to the outernational jazz sound being created by musical maverick Michael Reinboth and crew from Germany. This album spans the globe for inspiration and frequently touches down with Bossa and braziliance. Sunny sounds that have you nodding along and yearning for more. You may have to dig deep to understand where this is going but believe, evolution is not always apparent. Perfect for those who discover then spread the secret with latecomers. Essential. Not to be confused with the boring acid-jazz perpetuators of the early to mid nineties. Check the track Corso in heavy rotation with top Djs across the globe for a quick indication of the new direction in sound."
3,Not First Priority,"This cd has a unique song selection, and many are well played. These are largely simple songs that do not provide the interest of other dead songs though. The quality of playing is inconsistent and the sound is thin at times, not unusual for this period in the Dead life...when it seems many bandmembers had more pressing daily concerns than music."
3,One of the Weaker Dick's Picks,"Not quite sure why this 1985 show was released as a Dick's Pick.It's weak, frequently sloppy and uninspired.There are better versions of just about every song on other Dead releases.It simply cannot compare to the truly brilliant, inspired playing of the band on DP releases (and other Dead recordings) from the 60s and 70s. By the 80s, the band was sometimes phoning it in, as this release shows.I'm giving it three stars only out of my love for the Dead."
4,"Entertaining, smart, and informational.","Obsessed with food and cooking of late, I dove head first into this book. Enjoying his sass, criticism, wit, and knowledge on Iron Chef I had high hopes for this book. I was not let down at all. I believe the chapters are his past writings from Vogue and scattered with cool recipes, humorous stories, and great information about all types of food. I really enjoyed reading this book and am eager to read his other works."
5,Deliciously fabulous!,"Mr. Steingarten should be awarded for writing this book.I searched in vain for an email address so I could tell him directly how much I enjoyed his book. Leaving a short review here is my own way of saying THANK YOU. I could not have picked up a better companion for my two-month stay in Hanoi, where I went to study Vietnamese cuisine. Hours of very well written stories and good laughs.Anabela"
4,Almost Perfection....,"Jeffrey Steingarten presents a wonderful collection of his writings over the years relating to his all-consuming passion for fine food. He covers everything from the most exquisite Japanese cuisine to his quest for the perfect American pie crust. The only thing that keeps me from giving this book a fifth star is the fact that Jeffrey seems to be a little confused about his barbecue. I always have to look with suspicion at anyone who thinks that Memphis is the world capitol of barbecue and that the Memphis in May contest is the ultimate barbecue competition. His writing regarding the subject was certainly entertaining, but perhaps could have been better had he utilized a side-by-side comparison with Kansas City barbecue. (Kansas City would have won, hands down)"
4,I feel better about eating already!,"Combining rigorous science, diligent research, and a voracious appetite, Jefferey Steingarten takes us on a whirlwind tour of the world's gastronomic wonders, our dietary follies, and the best of everything in FOOD. With the cynicism of Theroux and the astute taste of Beard, Steingarten combines a love of experimentation with an unabashed appreciation of the best in cuisine, and manages along the way to drop names, receipies, techniques, and medical advice. Olestra gets a thumbs up, salad turns out to be a fearsome mix of organic horrors, and moderate drinking gets a moderate nod of approval. His extended ode to the white truffle and description of the simple wonder of a Japanese 'dashi' (soup stock) bring to life culinary worlds most of us will only ever imagine. You will laugh all the way to your neighborhood gourmet grocery!!"
5,A Hero for the Hungry,"You know, I used to buy ""Vogue"" magazine and plough through the thousands of pages of advertisements just to get the latest diatribe from this author. I actually have the 1992 issue with his ""Stuffing"" article and recipe (which earned rave reviews when I made it one Thanksgiving). So imagine my happiness when I found out he was publishing a whole book of his essays and recipes. And it did not disappoint.Why do I like this man? First of all, it's hard to dislike someone who will go out on a limb and say that salt, fat and even Olestra are okay for you, and back it up with data. Secondly, he appears in his essays to be aware that he has a dream job and is milking it for all it's worth; he doesn't have any pretensions that he knows any better than anyone else. Third, he's a darn good writer, and funny to boot. Anytime he decides he needs an assistant, he can give me a call. Lastly, his recipes are well-written and logical. Mmmmm. . . ."
5,Makes you want to rush out and cook the food he describes!,"I'm surprised that Vogue has a food critic that writes about anything other than the exciting dishes you can prepare with Equal, Diet Coke and Snackwell's, but nonetheless they do. This book is humorous (read Steingarten's chapters about pheromones and fake fat), fascinating (Did you know that the best french fries in the world are double fried in horse fat?) and also has some recipes that I'm itching to try as soon as I work up the courage. A definite must for any gourmet, gourmand or glutton."
1,Boring,"I have never liked Jeffrey Steingarten and find him stuffy and odd. I wanted to give this book a chance since the food industryis complex and it may give me an insight. I just couldn't finish the book tho, I still find him weird. Don't buy this"
4,Stop being so damn fussy!,"For all the fussy eaters out there - read this book! Your allergies are a lie, your dislikes are irrational. Jeffrey Steingarten shows how anyone can get used to anything, and that most people who claim ""allergies"" to a particular food aren't allergic at all, but need a socially acceptable excuse to not eat it.Stop it now. Read the book and stop making your life into a hell of ""Oh no, I can't eat that, I'm allergic, I'm so sorry, but you know, I realise you put a lot of effort into making that, I wish I could eat it etc. etc."""
2,Not as good as the reviews sounded.,"I was pretty disappointed in Steingarten's book. It's certainly not as riveting or entertaining as I expected from other reviews. What I found really annoying was the way he goes into intense, excruciating detail about some aspect of food, e.g. the taste of water. Then suddenly, as if he stopped, counted words, and realized he had made the required limit for his column, he cuts the article off with a unfullfilling, anti-climatic ""That's the way it is!"" (Not an exact quote of course!)"
3,"Very Funny in Parts, but a little too long","The author is quite funny in places, but ultimately one can read only so many descriptions of food. The best parts of the book are the more general essays on bread, ketchup, etc... At the end though I was exhausted. Its a good book, light,just tiring. I had to struggle to finish it. However, the next book I read ""Down These Mean Streets"" by Piri Thomas was an interesting an quick read. Check it out."
3,Good to eat,"I read about half of this book to my pre teen sons last year. Although they asked me to read something else before the end, they still talk about it. We learned some fascinating facts about food, and some of the chapters were hilarious. Eventually the book bogged down, but I can recommend it to foodies, info junkies, and anyone who enjoy a good laugh."
3,Inconsistent,"It's very inconsistent as far as the style and content. Some parts are every humorous and interesting; other parts are very boring and technical, like reading a textbook. It's .....OK."
2,The Man who Complained about Everything,"The title of this book drew me in. I love reading any book about food. I imagined Steingarten was going to memorize me with his lifelong stories of delicious treats and fabulous meals from far and wide. Instead, I read about a finicky man who drinks entirely too much diet Coke to comment on dietary needs. What am I supposed to eat Mr. Steingarten? Apparently spinach will kill me, but foie gras should be served for breakfast, lunch and dinner. His yo-yo dieting of veganism and high fat French fad diets doesn't exactly make him a trusting source for nutritional information. This book left me hungry, bored, scared to eat, and too intimidated to make mashed potatoes ever again. Instead of eating today, I guess I'll just call all those 1-800 numbers Steingarten likes to give out."
2,Inane,"What was the point? Not funny. Not insightful. Not entertaining. I tried hard, but I couldn't get through it."
1,A guy who likes to hear himself ramble,"After reading all of the reviews, I thought this would be a good, insightful read for someone who is interesting in the culinary arts. Instead, it's like listening to someone tell you a long boring story and you don't have the heart to stop them. He goes on about little projects like finding the cheapest subsistence diet, the difference between ketchups, and all the ridiculous diets he has been on. Very boring, inconclusive, and uninteresting. Also, I wouldn't trust anyone's palette who likes Diet Coke as much as this guy. $14 bucks wasted."
1,What a disappointment!,"I was eagerly waiting for the arrival of this book. It seemed so interesting and original... Wrong! I started reading it and found myself just skipping page after page. I have a pretty good sense of humour, but I found nothing funny in this book. Just some rattling of someone who thinks he is funny and who is apparently as much in love with himself as he is with some of the food he eats. I really do not recommend this book."
1,"Funny, maybe - nutritionally responsible not!","This may be a mildy entertaining and informative book on food around the world, but to make such wide claims as salad consumption leading to death is absurd. Steingarten obviously loves food and food high in fat, calories and cholesterol so this book will certainly make you, and himself, feel better about eating these foods, that is until you keel over from a heart attack. His advice on nutrition is out-dated, selectively researched and all together wrong in many areas. Please use caution when taking health advice from somone who spends days, weeks and a lifetime searching for the best french fry or ice cream cone."
2,JMER,"My thanks to Jerry Styner for producing this CD. I was glad to purchase the item, but I must report that I found it disappointing. I might have been expecting too much but I found that I don't like the songs, too slow for my taste, even for romatic ballads. And, the material seemed dated. Maybe that's what the producer was going for, but I could have heard this stuff in 1955. It really didn't sound ""gay"" to me either, if that makes any sense. I don't want to discourage anyone from buying the CD and I think it would help if potential buyers could hear some of the album via their computers. It may be available now, but I didn't have a chance to listen to any of the songs before I bought the CD. Anyway good luck to Jerry Styner, at least he made the effort."
2,I wrote this dreck,"There are very few copies of this 10-page 'masterpiece' (ha ha) extant. Thank God for that! It was a poorly written (I wrote it for a college writing class where we were assigned to follow some historic event or story) but an earnest recapitulation of the village of Delhi, in Wisconsin, near Eureka and Omro. Much of it was lifted from an earlier piece in the Oshkosh Daily Northwestern by a reporter whose name I have long since forgotten - though I think I credited him and I know that I sent him a copy, because he then kindly digested my recapitulation and put it into a story in the Northwestern. Delhi was a village along the banks of the Fox River, somewhere between Eureka and Omro, Wisconsin."
3,True Fan will appreciate,"All in all this hammer is cute for any Giants fan but I had an issue with its shipment. The Hammer came only in a cardboard box, no type of packaging, which was disappointing because it was a gift. Overall, in good condition, but the lack of packaging made it look like i re-gifted something i had already used."
5,A Great Quick Read,This is a great primer on how to get started.... or to even decide if you want to publish your own book. Great advice and down-home common sense.
5,"Top notch, authentic, brings back memories, good and bad",I listed to Adrian Cronauer for one year in Vietnam. His program was one of the things that kept us going. First rate.
1,Music Cut Up by Monologue,"Do not be mislead by the sample music. Each song is presided or followed by an editorial monologue. That maybe fine for one hearing, but to listen to this monologue over and over is just irritating. If you're looking for good music buy the original music from another source."
1,"Yet another ""Various Artists"" RIPOFF!!","Yes, you read it right!!It's getting so that I am NEVER going to order another CD from Amazon - it's THAT BAD!!WHY do the ""Various Artists"" even exist??!! Just to make abyssmal recordings and ""be just like the original performers?""News for Amazon and THEM - They don't even come close!! (Oh, and to make LOTS of money off people who are too young to know any better!)Trust me, the ""Various Artists"" CD's are a HUGE RIP-OFF!! It makes me angry that the music is sooooo trashy, soundwise, in order to fool you into thinking you are hearing a genuine, ""old"" recording that wasn't ""re-mastered."""
5,Heroic images,"Superman and Batman two heroes who get all the movies, toys, cartoons, etc... however with the Rocketeer we can start a new trend. Th Music by Horner fits right in with Superman by Mr. Williams and surpasses Mr. Elfman's work in Batman. on my Mix for heroes I included the Rocketeer as a tune for the golden Age Green lantern The Current GL has the Last Starfighter The Rocketeer is a thrilling adventure of the likes we just dont see any more The Music by Mr. Horner frames it and matches the spirit of it all so perfectly. you could have the worst day of your life and yet feel like a million bucks after listening to this sweeping score!"
5,Romantic and Moving Soundtrack for The Rocketeer,"The soundtrack for The Rocketeer is captivating from beginning to end. It perfectly complements the action on screen. The track that most comes to mind is Begin the Beguine, sung by Melora Hardin. This song provided a perfect romantic background for Jenny's and Sinclair's entrance into the South Seas club."
4,One of Horner's better works of the 90's,"James Horner's style has changed considerably over the years, from rich complex works, to synth drones, to bombastic, expansive music. The Rocketeer harkens back to Horner's earlier days in film with music that is similar in vein to Star Trek II and III and Krull. His score is tempered by an Americana warmth that pervades the music and provides a sense of innocence. The action music is propulsive and the Big Band era songs add just the right mix to this very satisfying album. Attention plagurist police, the main title piano theme is ""The Yellow Rose of Texas"" inverted.~DTodd Smith"
4,"As soundtracks go, this is a good one.","James Horner is perhaps better known for his ""Aliens"" and ""Star Trek II/III"" soundtracks. All those sound similar in theme, and Horner has managed something completely different with the ""Rocketeer"" soundtrack. It manages to be heroic and sort of down home at the same time, and is very pleasurable to listen to."
3,Two sountracks in one,"Not only do you get the score to The Rocketeer, you also get the score to The Natural. That's what it sounds like, any way. And since The Natural came out before Mr. Horner's work, well, I gotta wonder if that pesky subliminal influence crept in between the notes.Not that Randy Newman's work is all that fantastic. But more should be expected from Mr. Horner"
4,Good Times,"I enjoyed this CD very much. It has alot of good music, and shows once again that James Horner is a musical genius. However, this particular soundtrack pretty much uses one theme a whole lot, there are not a lot of individual themes developed. That's okay though, there are many many variations on the original theme enough to keep you interested the entire way through.Oh, and we can't forget the two very different 20s pop/jazz tunes on the CD written just for the movie.The only thing I regret is that not all of the music from the movie is present on this recording. However, I fear this is the only recording of this movie soundtrack that will ever exist, and don't worry, it's darned good.Well worth your money."
3,"Good sound, but themes are redundant","I enjoy this CD very much. The music has a sweeping charm and romantisicm to it. My only problem is that this score pretty much consists of two themes, the Rocketeer Theme and Jenny's theme, played over and over again. There's nothing wrong with the two themes, on the contrary they are both very enjoyable, but the CD simply needs more variety.On a different note, the Cole Porter songs are wonderful for anyone who enjoys his music, and the singer has a sultry voice that's perfect for the selection."
4,Solid '72 jammig,"This disc has some remarkable jams like a long The Other One and a good Playin' In The Band. All of the songs are tight and crisp if not as inspiring as other shows from this year, and indeed this month of 1972. Their are other releases from this tour all of which I have not heard, but I would recommend DP 36 over this cd if I had to choose between the two."
2,Big time fan.,"I actually think this is the second to worst season of the new class.(season one being the worst) Tommy D, RJ, and Lindsay were all god awful in this season. Ryan helped the show a lot, most notablly in seasons 4 and 5, but he is over shadowed by the previous 3 mentioned. Unless you're a hardcore fan of Saved by the Bell, I would skip this season and check out the new class seasons 4-7."
2,"Great nostalgia, horrible video transfer","For $3 for the whole season, it was worth it just to have some of my saturday mornings of yore to replay. But the show was filmed in poor video quality fit for NTSC sets of the 80's and 90's, transferred and encoded to Unbox to even worse quality, so what you get is a bleached, blurry image better viewed in it's tiny native size and never full screen."
4,Season 3,"its pretty cool. i agree with the dude that reviewed season 1 & 2 about the show picking up on its own after Ryan enters......its pretty cool, lindsay is pretty hot, she's just annoying....anyone agree?"
3,??,"I would like to review this product and I was excited to order, it, but sadly I Dont know , I never got it. Post office lost my package"
5,cool cards,A friend of has this program for the PC and I love it. I was so glad when I discovered that there was a version for the MAC. I have already started printing my holiday cards. It is so much un to personalize and print cards for friends and family.
2,Didn't work...,"No, didn't work on my Apple Computer . Not a good buy - but then again, it could be my apple."
1,Very hard to use!,"Upon receiving this item, I installed it on the computer. It didn't take long to see that the whole set-up is hard to navigate through. When you have the greeting card designs shown on the right side of the screen, you can't read what is on them, making it very tough to make a decision. Then when I went to use the graphics, I couldn't get to them...they wouldn't go into my greeting card that I had started. I have Print Shop 2 which is so much easier to use and navigate through and easy to see and read. It is so much more sophisticated then Greeting Card Factory. I am so unhappy with this purchase."
2,How to fix Greeting Card Factory,I installed Greeting Card Factory 1.02 on my Mac and it crashed every time I tried to run it from a user account. In the administrator account it ran fine. That's how I figured out that the problem is solely due to a poorly written installer that sets bad permissions. This can be fixed by running the Terminal from the administrator account and entering:sudo chmod -R 777 /Applications/Greeting\ Card\ Factory/Then you just enter your administrator password and everyone can use the program. I gave it just 2 stars because I blame the developer for this mess.
2,Not pleased with this card program,"I previously owned a PC and used American Greetings card program. I found this to be the best one out and I tried them all. Now that I have a Mac computer the choices are so limited in card programs. I ended up purchasing the Nova Card Factory and I am not at all pleased with it. A very limited selection of cards and not user friendly. I would not recommend this to anyone. I hardly use it. I wish they would make an American Greetings program compatible with the MAC computer.JulieDearborn, MI"
2,Too Complicated,We've been using a Hallmark greeting card program for years and recently purchased a Mac. This was the only product we could find that is made for Mac users and seemed to fit our needs. Problem is the software is way to complicated compared to the Hallmark software. It's definitely going to take awhile to learn and get used to it.
2,Nova Greeting Card Factory (Mac),After using the windows version I am disapointed with the Mac.It is difficult to navigate and very difficult to switch back and forth to read the cards.Difficulty in adding your own text.
3,THIS CD WAS WELL MADE BY ECW,ALTHOUGH THE CD WAS GOOD IT DIDNT HAVE THE THEME SONGS OF MOST ECW WRETLERS.IT DID HAVE SOME BUT I WAS A LITTLE DISAPOINTED BY THAT.
5,thanx,i had this cd about 15 years ago but i lost in the move to arizona.im very happy and will be buying form them again.thanx
3,Not bad,"This was actually a well made CD by Paul Heyman and ECW. The remakes on song great songs were actually a lot better than I thought they would be....some of the songs, I never heard before and really didn't want to hear again and couldn't even remember what they are now. Motorhead's remake on Metallica's Enter Sandman for The Sandman was very good and though not as good as Metallica's original, they did a damn good job on it. Snap your finger Snap your neck by Grinspoon for Justin Credible is still my favorite song on the album."
5,Best Wrestling Theme CD Out,"ECW has great music by real artists that sound great. It has an awesome hard sound to it and the music is great. I love Kilgore's ""Walk"" and Harry Slash and The Slashtones, Also ""The Zoo"" is a great song and so is ""Snap Your Fingers, Snap Your Neck"" By Gridspoon do an excellent job creating themes as well. Great CD that will not dissapoint"
4,Good CD,"This CD is very good, with only two exceptions. The wordless version of trust by megadeth and Motorhead's version of Enter Sandman are very disappointing, but since i own the original versions of both i dont really care. My favs are the ECW theme, Kilgore's ""walk""(Rob Van Dam's theme), and Grinspoon's ""snap your fingers, snap your neck""(Justin credible's theme). You don't have to like ECW the like this CD!"
4,GOOD COLLECTION OF ECW THEMES,"THIS ALBUM OF ECW THEME SONGS, WHICH ARE MOSTLY A BUNCH OF COVERS OF OLD HEAVY METAL CLASSICS, IS PRETTY EXCITING TO LISTEN TO. THE BEST TRACK ON HERE IS BRUCE DICKINSON'S ''THE ZOO''. MOTORHEAD'S RENDITION OF ''ENTER SANDMAN'' IS VERY GOOD. THIS CD REALLY REMINDS ME OF THE GOOD OLD DAYS OF WRESTLING [BACK WHEN THERE WAS MORE THAN JUST THE WWE TO LOOK AT] THAT I'LL POSSIBLY NEVER SEE AGAIN. GET THIS CD NOW."
4,"Good stuff, both for EC F'N W fans and regular fans","Some dang good stuff in there, I particularly like Harry Slash and the Slashtones stuff. The Enter Sandman is a little bit worse then the original. I'd recommend it to both Wrestling fans.. (You can leave your *krash* and stupid 30 second pop soundbites at home WWFers) and fans of metl"
3,It's OK.,"It isn't great, but it isn't terrible either. It has some cool songs like the cover of ""Walk"" and ""Snap Your Fingers, Snap Your NecK"", but also has some bad songs like the horrible cover of AC/DC's classic ""Big Balls"" and a mediocre cover of the Metalica classic ""Enter Sandman"". I think ECW should have stuck with the original songs. Let's hope they do that for Extreme Music Volume 2 which should be released some time this spring or summer."
3,Not the REAL Extreme...,"However much the CD does kick arse and signifies the ECW wrestlers and fans, it isn't the real thing. Most of the songs are done by coverbands or just are not nearly as good as the originals. The same intensity is not in the CD. WALK does not have the same effect it should, and Big Balls is muttered by some drool buffoon. It could and should have been better. I almost would rather get the 14 different cds and find the music myself."
2,eh,Good cd but most of the covers suck. Motorhead should be killed. He sounds like a 90 y/o guy hooked up to a respirator! Grinspoon sounds like he is holding his nose shut while singing and Muscadine shouldn't be allowed to call themselves a band. He only talks and the backround singers sing in opera! I am an ECW fan but they could do so much better! And Trust is a GREAT instrumental. It's my fav. song on the CD!
4,Good afternoon flick,"The film was very well done for an independent film. The plot was fun, there was mystery, suspense and definately a top thriller.The only issue I had was the ending was a little too mainstream for an independent film. Definately worth the money."
1,Fences are there for a reason,"I have to admit that I'm a fan of some thriller/horror/slasher/sci-fi flicks, but I didn't get this one. I happen to like Predator, and I thought Blair Witch was good by playing on a different set of fears than the usual movies in this genre. This movie basically came across to me as a one hour and ten minute family drama tacked on to an instructional bow-hunting buildup to 7 minutes of transparent effects. We kept checking the remaining time, trying to figure out how they were going to squeeze any action into it.They didn't.And, just because the fence is bent up, don't go under it."
3,Son of Blair Witch Project,"So-so beer and pretzel movie. B-grade movie, decent acting. Movie starts slowly, but the suspense builds and actually did hold my interest once the characters got in the woods to hunt deer. Once there, the hunters become the hunted. I enjoyed the ""surprise"" ending too, although it was somewhat predictable. Worth renting for a weekend evening if you don't have anything better to do."
5,"Very good new age - low key, well engineered.",Deuter has turned out tasteful albums and this is one of his best. New Age music should be unobtrusive and this is. It should stand up to repeated listening and this does. It should be relaxing without being monotonous and this is. Enjoyable. And it passed my sleep test - it put me to sleep last night so that I never heard the end of the album.
4,Love this cd,"My first Deuter cd was ""Reiki, Hands of Light"" which I liked very much, then I got ""Koyasan Reiki Healing"" which is the best so far. I would say this cd is in between the two. You can load all three of these and play them one after the other or shuffle and it's seamless. Great for use in my massage business!"
5,Deuter's Done it Again!,"I love this CD! I've always been a fan of Deuter's and he never ceases to astonish me with his musical talent. If you like soothing, yet exciting, music, this is a must-buy"
3,Music good but cd poor and shipping poor,I love the music.. it is great for relaxation as I am a massagetherapist. Actually I would have sent it back... it came wrapped in very little bubble wrap and after playing it a couple of times I could tell it was scratched.. I ran it through my cd cleaner and it is ok.. The music is beautiful and I do not mean to give a bad review of it...Amazon is the one that needs to improve. and this was from Amazon not a individual..
4,Must-Have for any who are interested in Past Lives,"The only reason I gave this great book 4 stars is because its plot takes place in the Medieval Era. For those who do not feel they lived during that time...this book would not be as interesting or intriguing. However if you feel a strong resonance, whether its a positive or negative, to this time Era then buy this book and you will be taken back to that time through the stories of those who actually did live. You will hear how their horrible death, how they found love, how they lost love. Wonderful book!"
3,An Interesting read,"I've long thought that my medieval tendancies have related to past lives. This book chronicles a study group of medieval reenactors, SCAdians, and Farie folk who are regressed to past lives which occured during the middle ages and then the data is compared with historical fact.There were a couple of people's stories that I really enjoyed, especially that of Helen. I found these peeks to be entertaining and an interesting glimpse into the lives of ordinary people during the middle ages. Though in the end the author shares many interesting statistics from the study I didn't find there to be any overall conclusion."
4,A sentimental journey,"This sensitive, coming-of-age story weaves its magic slowly but the emotions are real, the characters are true to life, and the story is as current as today's border patrol vigilante headlines. This small movie revisits the same emotional territory first tread by ""Paper Moon"" a generation ago. It is the kind of movie that Hollywood doesn't make anymore, namely an unconventional, off-beat story about the adventures and bond between a father and his teenage daughter and their struggle to survive as a family unit. Highly recommended."
5,Great story; visually beautiful,"Coyotes is a wonderful movie that weaves the dynamics of relationships, cultures, families and expectations into a story both simple and complex. The main characters portray the basic human yearning to belong as they stumble over obstacles toward the surprising resolution to their dilemmas. The setting is beautifully captured by the stunning cinematography and the acting is sweetly subtle, supported by concise dialog and understated expressions. This is a great movie to have on hand for home viewing with guests and those who delight in undiscovered movie gems."
2,Boring,I wasn't going to finish watching this movie because I thought it would be boring and it was. The story line was not very good. The idea that this man and his 12 yr. old daughter were traveling all over the United States and Mexico looking for work was unreal. The police never caught up with him to find out why the girl wasn't in school or had an address always kept me wondering. The movie also started with the guy and his daughter driving Lord knows where. There was no real beginning or end.
1,Pathetic imitation of Classic Curious George,"I accidentally bought this book in a boxed set, along with 9 other titles by Vipah Interactive. They are all TERRIBLE. The original Curious George was a fun-loving monkey, who enjoyed life. Sure, he did silly things, and suffered the consequences, but he had a ball. THIS George is curious, but meek, and constantly being punished and berated for his misdeeds. Here, George, who felt too small all day at the amusement park, dreams that he's very big - and finds out that he can't do anything then, either. The lesson of ""George's Dream"" is that you should be content just the way you are, which is a *terrible* lesson for growing children. This is lousy book."
5,Love it!,"This nail buffer works great. I have been using them for a while now, and I am very pleased with the results. I like having smooth, shiny nails without using nail polish."
1,NOT a potty training doll,"After watching Dr. Phil's Primetime Special on how to potty train in one day, I bought this doll as suggested. It's a great baby doll for pretend play, but not for potty training. It does NOT hold the water so that you can show the ""trickling"" effect into the potty. The water goes straight through while you're feeding the water from the bottle. So my search for the perfect potty training doll continues. The doll I find, needs to hold the water so that my toddler gets the idea when she sees it going in the potty."
1,I'm all wet,"I bought this doll to help potty train my toddler. We're starting tomorrow, so I took it out of the box tonight to try it. The tip of the bottle was too short, so when I tried to give the bottle to the doll, the water dribbled all over her, me, and the floor. A tiny bit made it into the potty. I tried and tried to make it work, but I just got soaked. I'm an intelligent person who doesn't usually struggle with assembling toys, but this stupid doll has been peeing all over me all night. Then, to top it all off, a really creepy looking bug crawled out of the packaging. So the whole thing went in the garbage outside, and now I don't know what I'm going to do tomorrow. I wish I had that money back. Buy something else."
4,A little taste of what was to come,"From the second I heard Geoff Tate screaming at the beginning of this little EP I was hooked on this band and still am. The only reason it gets only four stars is out of respect for what was to come. Four powerful songs, two powerful guitars, one powerful, unmatchable voice."
5,"Yes, It's That Good","I have owned this since it first came out. These guys were barely old enough to shave when it was released. Given the age of the band members at the time, every cut on here is unbelievably well written and executed (despite the poor production quality). Queen Of The Reich is the cut that got the band on MTV and is a classic Hair Metal song , Nightrider and Blinded tilt more towards Speed Metal and The Lady Wore Black is a Goth drenched feast . Prophecy was not on the original EP. If memory serves me, it was originally recorded for their 2nd. LP . Most ""bonus cuts"" are pretty lame, but not this one. This EP is one of the best initial offerings by any band, ever."
4,This album rocks!!!,This release is the best that the band has done other than Operation Mind Crime and Empire. This is raw rock and roll. Geoff Tate's vocals are rockin.
3,A Heavy Introduction,"This EP is different than anything Queensryche has done since. It's pretty much metal in most places. The guitars create good soundscapes along with Geoff Tate's great vocals. ""Queen of the Reich"" is classic Queensryche at its best. You can tell ""Prophecy"" was recorded during the making of ""Rage for Order"" by its style and production. Good introduction from one of the best progressive hardrock groups."
4,And so the legend begins......,"Every song on here is wonderful and a prelude to the wonder that would become Queensryche. A great beginning to a legend that will never end. Classic, classic, classic."
5,Tremendous begining,"This Ep was the begining of the most talented band to grace our time. Although Queensryche would become a band of many different sounds(all of which were great),the Ep was a very powerful,heavy release with some of the most awe inspiring, piercing vocals of the time. this band showed right away why they were destined for greatness through the aforementioned vocals as well as some very gifted time changes and very tight musicianship. Even before this release the media was raving about these guys, and their debut was in no way a let down, but truly only a beginning. This one is a must for all fans of true metal."
4,Highly listenable 80s metal,"Queensryche's debut EP is a strong release and doubly so because, unlike other young bands, they didn't waste any time by including clunkers on a full-length album. Fans of Operation: Mindcrime will find much to enjoy on Queensryche, even though it is heavier and doesn't have the catchy choruses.Production isn't outstanding, but doesn't bring the record's quality down any.All in all, every song is good (although I can't comment on the song Prophecy since, for some reason, it's not included on the cassette I own), and for Queensryche fans, this EP is a necessity."
4,Promise from the start,"The first thing the band put out, plus ""Prophecy"". All five of these songs are great, just like everything else the band put out later. Already highlighted are Geoff Tate's 3 octaves of vocals, brought to fruition through is previous days of opera. These songs show the incredible potential of the band at the time and is a must for true Queensryche fans."
4,An excellent book with only a few minor drawbacks.,"Piers Anthonys book ""Tatham Mound"" was an excellent story. From the beginning it is exciting and gives one a very in depth and real idea of what Native American life might have been like. I recommend it to readers from teen up. The whole plot is well laid out. A few parts may drag a little but, as always, Mr. Anthony never leaves you disappointed."
2,hated the hero but...,"The story was good, it started with a strong captivating story I really wanted Selina to findhappiness after all that happened to her but Ashley was not good enough for her. I have read manybooks where the hero's are jerks and hard to like but this one I just couldn't. Charlotte Lamb shouldhave changed his attitute in the story once he learned the truth from her brother but he continue to physically andemotionally abuse her. I liked Selina's story and this had the potential to be a great romance but I could not buytheir love a the end."
4,Great Bath Toy,"I bought this for my daughter when she was 8 months old and time to transition her into the ""big"" bathtub. I knew it was important for her to enjoy her bath and wanted to provide entertainment for her. This is a ""must have"" for every parent. It has strainers, a stringy sponge, and a ""water faucet"" that you squeeze to have the water flow. It is wonderful for her because she loves to figure out how things work."
4,Would buy again!!,"I bought this bath toy for my two year old little boy, because his other bath toys were ready to be retired. This product met all of my expectations with the exception of the product description. The toy is wonderful, but the description made it sound like it did a little more than it actually does. i.e. it takes forever to get water to come out of the squeeze faucett and a few of the toys don't stay on the sink well. However, I do love the mesh basin (kids can put things in and take things out) and the hanging part of the toy (will prevent the toy from mildew). Obviously, the above irritations would not keep me from buying this product again, because I would suggest this for anyone with a busy boy or girl."
3,Yucky gunk gets stuck,"I thought this would be a great toy for my kids, and while they love it I had a minor problem with it. I had to throw out the squirt bottle and sponge because after several uses they got yucky mildew gunk stuck and I couldn't get it all the way clean. I made sure to empty the toy of water after each use but with all the baths at our house it never really got a chance to fully dry out in between uses so the yucky gunk got stuck in the water bottle and in the fuzzy sponge. Since my girls put everything in their mouths I got grossed out and threw away those two pieces."
2,"Eh, nothing special","I bought this for my almost 2 year old after reading the rave reviews. It's pretty disappointing. It doesn't do anything but float. The blue spray nozzle doesn't really work. You're supposed to squeeze it and it acts like a squeeze toy and is SUPPOSED to make the water run. Instead you get a airy spray of water. The only thing my daughter really seems to like about it is the orange cup that has holes on the bottom. She likes to scoop up water in it and watch it trickle out from the bottom. It's an okay toy I guess, but don't expect anything spectacular."
3,Pretty Good,"Its a cute toy...I think I like it more than my 15 month old. He does enjoy twisting the little red knob to make a clicking sound. I am not sure that he gets that its a sink. I probably should have stuck with duckies, fish and boats..he seems to like those the best...however I think its just personal preference. He may enjoy the sink-like qualities when he is a bit older. This does have to hang up to dry...so make sure you have room in your tub/shower."
2,Oruginal ending song,"I'm pretty sure that a song in original ending is by Leonard Gohen, but I can not figure out which song. Does anybody know?"
3,"A decent try, but I still recommend it. Reasons below.","Considering the circumstances surrounding John Powell's late entrance to the ""Identity"" crew, he serves up a decent job. The score is, ultimately, a-ok. It's not bad, but unfortunately, not too great, either. But, I'd still recommend it.See, what's really rewarding about the Identity soundtrack is when you listen to it, think ""eh,"" and then listen to ""The Bourne Supremacy"" soundtrack right after. Supremacy's soundtrack is much better, more so when you've heard Identity. Supremacy is a series of variants of the original Identity themes and to hear them respun into such goodness is more than worth the cost."
3,Searching for song...,Does anyone know the artist/title of the song that plays in the Alternate ending of the extended version? I've been trying to figure it out and find but am having no luck.
5,"Excellent movie, excellent score!!!",Went to see the film last week and was very pleasantly surprised. Matt Damon and Franka Potente were fantastic and I must have traveled to three different music stores before finding the CD...See the movie. You won't be disappointed.
3,Car chase music,"To 'Music fan' in Texas, I stumbled across the music to the car chase by accident, I am pretty sure it is the first song on Paul Oakenfold's Album 'Bunkka', the track titled 'Ready Steady Go'Hope this is useful as this is the best track in the film!"
2,Needs to know,"I can not find out who does the song on the alternative ending, and i just love it. Someone please let the world know!"
4,Alternate ending song,"The song that plays during the alternate ending of the movie is ""In the Sun"" by Joseph Arthur.Hope it helps!"
4,Alternate ending song.,"For all those looking(and it's not on this album)The song is called ""In the Sun"" by Joseph Arthur from the album 'Come to Where I'm From'."
3,Missing songs from this soundtrack,"To those of you wanting the music from THE CHASE SCENE & THE ENDING...These songs are NOT on the soundtrack album. They are by MOBY and Paul Okenfold. It is very misleading and if a movie is going to put out a soundtrack then ALL the songs should be on it. But, if you're going for the rest of the music during the movie it's good."
3,Not the Soundtrack you are looking for,"This is what I consider the score rather than the soundtrack. I thought the movie soundtrack was pretty good, so I ordered this the next day. Disappointment set in as I discovered that it doesn't contain the songs but the background music that was made for the movie. It's not bad or good, but it's not what most of us are looking for. I was somewhat sceptical before buying but the John Powell et al suggested that it contained more than just John Powell's music - it doesn't."
2,What a letdown...,"Like most of you, I purchased this CD for the SOLE purpose of owning ""the chase scene"" music, and patiently waited through the entire 19 tracks only to find out - IT'S NOT IN THERE!!! Feel like strangling someone...As for the CD ""as is"", I guess it's O.K., if you are into soundtracks. Never really been a huge fan of them, myself. One or two songs are kinda cool, but the whole CD seems to be building up to something that it never delivers. Should've read ALL of the Amazon reviews BEFORE I spent my money. Bummer."
2,Not all that...,"I am frankly puzzled by the rave reviews of this CD. I have listened to it several times and while it makes for good background listening (I have used it to track into my home videos), it's not all THAT.John Powell has done much better, more interesting work and while his string arrangements and interesting orchestrations here do deserve some attention, the score as a whole comes across as decidedly un-memorable."
4,Track for DVD alternate ending??,I am also trying to find out the name of the song and the artist for the alternate ending on the dvd. It's a great song and I would greatly appreciate any help.
2,Not the soundtrack,"I bought this CD expecting a soundtrack. Instead it is a score of the basic theme music of the movie. While enjoyable as backgound music, Powell is stretching to find 19 ways to explore the theme, and I grow tired of it after a while.I wish the package had been properly marked (""Score for the Bourne Identity"")."
4,what about the 'alternate ending?',"The 'Score is fine and dandy, but...does anyone know who sang/performed/wrote the track for the alternate ending?"
3,Alternate Ending Song,"In case anyone wants to know the song from the alternate ending is ""Joseph Arthur's"" album ""Come To Where I'm From"" titled ""In The Sun."""
4,Car Chase and End Theme Info,"The exact name of the 'car chase theme music' is Ready Steady Go by Paul Oakenfold (correct spelling). The 'end theme song' is Extreme Ways by Moby. Exteme Ways can be found on the follow up single to we are all made of stars, which is helpfully called Extreme Ways- released in August 2002. Ready Steady Go can be found on Oakenfold's album released June 2002 titled Bunkka. By the way, the easiest solution to getting either of these songs is just to download them! Personally i think the single and album are both worth the money though, you decide :o)"
4,"A good soundtrack, but have reservations","""The Bourne Identity"", the scores in the movie were very intense, enough to make me want to buy the CD. After buying it, I was somewhat let down, but not disappionted. I expected to hear some more melodic techno beats that were familiar in the movie, such as the background music during the car chase scene, or the stylish Moby ""Porcelain"" sounding music during the end credits. I understand this is a Motion Picture Soundtrack, so I cannot expect anything new from what was heard in the movie. Most of the tracks sound kind of mixed, uneven, scratchy and muffled, it fit the mood of the particular scene, but listening to it alone without the movie makes it hard to get into. I hoped they would have included the more cooler scores. On the bright side, there was one gold gem on track 3 ""Treadstone Assassins""...it is simply a cool rif! I would recommend borrowing the CD first and listening to it before shelling out your hard earned money."
3,Audio is too fast.,"This audio/book pack was good, except for the spoken part of the audio tape was very fast and sometimes difficult to understand, by the time I repeated the phrase-the speaker was on the next phrase to learn/repeat. I am still searching for a great thai/english teaching program. Any suggestions of yours to me are welcome."
2,IAmodeo73@hotmail.com,This course is not thorough in the least. It gives no description of sentence structure. It is totally dialoge. I would recomend either the Teach Yourself or if you realy want to learn order Courage Softwares Thai interactive learning system. But dont get me wrong if you just want learn Thai for a brief vacation this course is OK.
1,Disappointing,"I've been to the author's website and it is wonderful. I ordered this book with high expectations which were crushed in the first few pages. As one who has struggled with self-injury, I say that they didn't necessarily say anything wrong, but somehow I felt more frustrated, hopeless, and even looked down upon the farther I got into the book. Whether it was what was said or how the message was delivered, I don't know. Perhaps for helpers it's a good book. But to self-injurers looking for hope, GET A DIFFERENT BOOK!"
4,You can't just read the book and expect a difference,"I read this book during and after my stay at SAFE Alternatives. I found it a good reminder of a lot of the philosophy behind the program. Just reading a book about the program is not the same as going through the program itself. A lot of the program relies on the people there, the therapists and the peers. Talking is a big part of it, and a big part of what helped me, and you don't get that from doing the book on your own. Also, you have to make the program your own. Just doing exactly what they tell you doesn't cut it. You have to have the commitment to quit self-injury and to get healthy. The book does sound like an ad. But I think that they wrote the book because they were proud of this program that seems to have helped so many people, myself included. There is no way to make a book with that sort of premise sound like anything but an ad."
3,"worth a read, but a bit preachy","I read this book because I've been really interested in the topic lately from a mental health worker's persepctive. Although the authors seem extremely familiar with the phenomenon of self-injury and with the strategies that may help sufferers overcome the behavior, their writing style conveys a certain condescending preachiness. Placing self-injury on a continuum with other body modifications such as piercings and tattoos not only seems false, but is also rather culturally insensitive. Additionally, the main points of the book are stressed fairly early in the text and just keep resurfacing. It may have been better to leave out a few chapters and save some paper. ;)On the plus side, the elements of the SAFE program that they outline sound like very helpful tips for those struggling with self-injury or for their family members. In addition, the case study-like vignettes about patients provided a human touch to the book."
5,The Best Book,"Hello,This is the best book on this very special and misunderstood problem. If you can only get one book, buy this book and share it with anyone you know.Andrew Levander"
5,Read this book.....,"This book was very helpful, infact because of this book I was able to realize and come to terms with things that were happening in my life that I hadn't opened my eyes up to before. It helped a great deal with a break through with counseling, infact right now my counselor is reading the book I got her. I personally recommend this book to everyone I know who has struggled with self-injury or someone who knows a self-injurer. Honestly this book is worth every dime even if you don't go to the S.A.F.E program. If I could have gone I would have in a heart beat! Thank you so much to the authors! Good luck to everyone! Stay safe! Hugs!"
2,So-So,"This book as some good points and the program it discusses may be very successful. My main problem with this book and most others on SI is it's emphasis on SI stemming from childhood abuse or trauma. I self-injured for nearly 4 years as a teen and have never been abused in any way. According to this book if I wasn't overtly abused, I was biologically frail and sensitive to less obvious abuse or trauma. That is just insulting. I am now a counselor myself and I can assure you, I was never abused. While many individuals who self-injure may have been abused I think it is time to acknowledge those who self-injure and weren't abused instead of simply dismissing their experiences."
5,The Best - but reissue the original,"Sure I'm prejudice because Blue Plate Special came right out of my hometown. Nevertheless, a long stint at The Derby honed this band into - hands down - the best neo-swing band of the last 15 years. Blue Plate Special is not a converted rock or ska band that chose to take advantage of the neo-swing movement. They are firmly based in jazz. This album captures that band at the height of their talents, before other opportunities shattered the line-up. That is, most of the album does that. Anthony Parcheesi replaces Fred Stuart's original vocals on the first two songs. Stuart had left the band between the original recording sessions and the albums wide release. Parcheesi has a pleasant voice but can't match Stuart's ability to tell a story with his vocals. I haven't heard of the band in a while, so it may have finally given in. If you want to hear the best the neo-swing movement had to offer, get this album...but they should reissue the original version."
5,Favorite Song,I have many drifters albums but none of them have my favorite song -- Little Red Book --- in it's original form. I was so happy to find this.
3,A decent slice of Gene,"Personally I enjoyed these recordings. Clark doesn't have the vocal ability of a McGuinn or Hillman but he puts forth a refreshing version of ""Tambourine Man"" which I found intriguing because of the piano prominence. I wasn't particularly impressed with his version of ""If You Could Read My Mind"" but the other tunes are certainly listenable even though a bit on the lightweight side. As far as the Clark penned Byrd's classic ""Feel A Whole Lot Better"" there's not really too much anyone could do to make this song sound bad.All in all a good buy but only if you can get it at a budget price. I bought my copy in a cut-out bin for 50 cents. How could I go wrong?"
5,Bing and Christmas go together,I received the CD in new condition as advertised. The delivery was well within parameters promised. The CD is great and I enjoy listening to it this holiday season.
5,Nice Little Treat,"I really enjoy Christmas music and I really enjoy Mr. Crosby. With that said I'm already prejudiced. This is a delightful holiday listen. It is a great collection of some of Bing's best loved and well known tunes, and few less known."
5,Great Tribal House Grooves,"DJ Blackstone mixes live with some of the hottest house anthems, which includes, ""Women Beat Their Men"" and the fierce mix of ""Wake Up Your Mind"".The cd opens with some inspirational vocals from ""The More I Get..."" I think the out of place song in the CD is track 2 ""Doctor Disco"" I think DJ Blackstone heard the mistake and he only let this track go for about 50 seconds, thanks.But the CD picks-up, where it should have, with The trance like ""(The) Kama Sutra"". I'm not going to ramble, so purchase the cd and see what you think.I'm waiting with enraptured joy for the next DJ Blackstone project!"
1,The album is amazing...but this version is WAY overpriced...,Actually I think overpriced might be an understatement. $98 for a CD/DVD? Never.I purchased this exact import for $30.
3,The Korean War,"Start reading this book at the end if you don't have the time to read through every minute negotiation and battle during this three-year war. Chapter Ten is an excellent overview of how twenty nations on six continents became deeply and fatally involved with what Stueck calls a ""substitute for World War III.""I was grateful for the maps that Stueck provides along with his text. Because Stueck rarely provides a year along with a date, I could not tell if he was going forward or backward to explain a point. His skipping around in time was confusing. My knowledge of the Korean War before I read this book was fairly limited, gleaned from years of watching MASH on TV. Because of Stueck's thorough coverage, I now know many of the international nuances behind the historical relationship between the US and Korea."
4,Useful,We found this guidebook to be very helpful in this city that was completely new to us. I would recommend any Eye WitnessTravel Guide to any country to anyone.
4,A fully researched travel guide,"This book is just what it says it is. I plan to use it to travel in Russia, and it gives me all the information I need."
5,Very useful guidebook,"This Eyewitness travel guide is everything a person needs to not only to survive, but to have fun and see a lot of the St. Petersburg fantastic sights. The city is divided into 5 main areas and there is detailed information about all of them in later chapters. The book has numerous photos and the map of the city is great. The books also has information about beautiful palaces scattered around SPB and how to get there.A couple things that I think were missing. First most museums are closed on the last Tuesday of the month for maintenance (I came from SPB last week). The museums also charge more from foreigners (virtually everywhere entrance tickets cost 100 roubles for a Russian (or Russian-speaking) person and 300-350 roubles from everyone else). So learning a few words of Russian is advisable.This book was very useful while exploring the city and is definetely worth buying."
4,Great as a client for a PVR,"This is a great little unit as a client for a PVR such as BeyondTV or Sage - I use SageTV in my house and have 3 of these clients running a free plug in specific for Sage. They work great, the picture is super, and since there's no moving parts or excessive heat they're completely silent - they work perfectly.I don't think I'd get one to run just stand alone and have it fetching media and pictures and such off remote computers - the application that comes with it is not the greatest. But since I'm using the Sage interface, no problems.The only downside, although it's a small one, is the response to the remote is just a little sluggish - not bad, but be aware when you hit the ""skip ahead"" button when watching a recorded TV program it'll lag by, perhaps, half a second. I've gotten used to it and don't mind at all. And since I have automatic commercial skip with Sage, I rarely have to use it anyway."
2,a sloppy piece of junk,"This is one of the best ways to add a major security hole in your network. The MVP allows full filesystem list and read access to the entire computer running the media server. There is no way to disable this ""feature"". Also, the remote interferes with my Phillips television (most manufacturers test their IR scheme for interactions to prevent this sort of thing). although it looks like it should, the mvp does not have any hardware display. it also does not show song names from internet radio streams and requires streams to bounce through your computer.my experience with tech support was not good either."
2,Really slow,The software was not written well for the device at all. When you click on a media file sometimes you see a little circle populating to let you know the file is being read (sometimes it doesn't) It streams music extremely well and the radio function is a nice touch. I am really disappointed that you can't zoom in on your video files which is a really basic function. I wouldn't buy this product again
4,excellent product for price paid,Excellent device. It has crashed a couple of times when trying to shuffle photos or images when there were a lot in the directory but I would definetly buy it again and recommend it to others. No other product exists out there right now with the feature set that this does.
1,Device Froze Up After Two Weeks,"For the first few weeks the Media MVP did exactly what I wanted it to do. It sent video and audio to my entertainment center. But after two weeks of normal usage the box stopped responding to its remote control and was unable to find the computer with the Media MVP software. Customer support is minimal and although the box is priced affordably and worked fine for a short period, it failed quite quickly.With no reset button or way to access the firmware on the set top box there is little I can now do with this box other than use it as a paper weight."
1,Speaker Pins,"These connectors are nice and miniature, but the screw that will hold the wire in place is very, very small. It will not secure the wire in the connector, no matter how hard you try. The wire will slip out very easily."
3,Perfect For Poppins Fans,"As Disney Sing Along Songs go, this one is not particularly great- at least for me. Nothing particularly wrong, it's just that I'm not the biggest fan of Mary Poppins. For you Poppins fans though, it is a bit of a feast with 3 Poppins songs. And as is routine, other Disney songs compliment this video."
5,Exactly what I wanted!,"I was looking for a small, good-loking system for my bedroom, that would play both tapes and CDs (including home-recorded) and include a radio. This system definitely fills the bill. The controls are easy to use, and it sounds good, too, even at very low volume."
2,Microsystem with a cassette player!,"The good: Nice, compact elctronics, including a cassette player (becoming a rarity)The bad: Speakers, but you can hook up your own"
5,BEST COMPACT STEREO,I bought this system for my son who is 38. He wanted something for the garage while he was working. He said the sound is great it looks goodand said I made a great purchase.
4,Nice little system,"I use this in my home gym area. Perfect volume level for that setting. If using as a main music source, might want to upgrade to a more powerful wattage system."
5,Panasonic Audio Micro-System,"Wonderful product, especially for the money. Great tonal clarity; reverb and audio settings available are usually found on more expensive systems."
4,"Good system, sound is acceptable","This is a decent stereo, nice for small spaces. Don't expect any miracles on the sound, however. I can only compare it to the small system I'm replacing, a 20-year old JVC boombox that gave up the ghost last week, and I don't think the Panasonic has quite the presence or clarity of that old boy. If you have the time, it's a good idea to head off to a local audio shop to test things before you buy, but for about 100 dollars, this is a pretty good choice."
4,Pathfinder: the title says it all,"This was the first album I had ever heard from this progressive rock group. I bought it because of the original cover, which was a six-frame fold out poster of an astronaut riding a horse on the moon. Although the music is not as dynamic as other prog rock bands of the time, Beggars Opera have held a place in my heart for years. MaCarthur's Park is the best piece on the album in my opinion and the rest are very good; especially the ""dark and moody"" to ""light and spirited"" song ""From Shark To Haggis"". Musically, this is a delight to listen to, though it seems under-produced at times and the musical ""style"" and ""feel"" tend to change from song to song, but the album is called Pathfinder. Over-all definitely worth the money....but when is GET YOUR DOG OFF ME going to be re-released, that was the classic one!"
3,Beggars can't be choosers,"Beggars Opera were a progressive group with a pleasant classic rock air to help contrast keys and organ work with heavier guitar effects. It is a sound that drifts south of Kansas, suffering from some occasional embarrassing datedness, but it is a sound good enough."
3,Predictable plot,"Alice Glendenning is living a nightmare. Her beloved husband hasdrowned and his body never recovered. Her children have beenkidnapped and the ransom demand is the same amount as his lifeinsurance check, should it ever arrive. Add to the mix a caraccident where her ankle is broken and a visit from her jailbirdbrother-in-law ,Rafe.Although I felt the Ed Mcbain wrote an interesting tale, including some snappy lines,I felt the story was predictable and not a winner in my book."
2,Ed McBain Is Finally Getting Too Lazy,"That's right. Ed McBain fell down this time.The lean, snappy dialogue is still there. The details of how to commit an interesting crime are still there. And the plot even contains some police procedural stuff, even if the 87th Precinct isn't the locale of this story.Unfortunately, the reader can ""feel"" McBain cutting corners. You can almost hear the ticker counting, telling him that he has to finish a certain number of words before the day is out. The depth, detail, and humor that make up the signature of the best work by Ed McBain/Evan Hunter are missing here. I wish I'd simply waited for the next 87th Precinct title."
1,McBain Fails,"This is not your typical McBain book. The plot and the characters are not believable at all. This seems to be a put down on all local law enforcement as well as FBI. I long for new Matthew Hope or the 87th stories, which are the author's strong points. I will keep this in my library but unlike all my others by McBain this will not be reread."
2,No surprises here,"After reading an overview regarding the plot of this book, I decided to give Ed McBain's latest novel a whirl. After 20 minutes into the book, I had the mystery figured out. Okay, I was a little off on one of the characters (I surmised it was a girl in the Caribbean and actually it was a black girl who worked at the local ice cream depot, but still...). I read the entire book in one day and while enjoyable, it is predictable even to the politically correct Bush bashing (bad economy and he stole the election from Gore, dag-nabbit) which has nothing whatsoever to do with the plot. If you want a mindless, easy-to-put-down and finish quickly book, ""Alice in Jeopardy"" is for you. If you want a novel full of surprises and twists, amazing characters and an author who leaves his personal politics out of the story, pick up a Harlan Coben novel."
1,Where has Ed McBain gone?,"This truly was the most disappointing Ed McBain book I have read! By the time I had read 150 pages I decided I'd had enough...the plot is too easy to figure out, no suspense, the cops are a farce and put a bad name on Florida law enforcemente, etc., etc. I sure hope McBain goes back to the 87th Precinct and ""finds himself"" once again."
4,Alice in Jeopardy,"A bold departure for a true professional. I have been reading Ed McBain since 1972 and this one caught me off guard.The characters are poorly done. You never get to know the children or much about them. Then McBain makes a 180 degree turn from the 87th to the police and FBI in this story, who are more like ""The Keystone Cops"". It's a different kind of novel, but the bottom line is that it works in the end."
2,"Contractural obligation, or what?","I've read at least 25 McBain/Hunter books and this is probably the only one I wouldn't recommend. The plot is full of holes, such as the police leaving the main character totally alone in the middle of an investigation.As a few have mentioned, there are characters that contribute nothing to the story and serve no purpose. There are some misplaced political asides that appear from nowhere also. I guess they made Ed feel better at the time. Both the characters and the commentary are distractions and nothing but filler.It's sad that Ed/Evan has passed on, and he was a great, some would argue the greatest, author of the police procedural, but this isn't one of them by a longshot."
2,Vovo dos manuais de instrucao do kitesurf,"Desatualizado. Parece querer ser um manual de instrucao, ou ate talvez seja o vovo dos manuais do kitesurf. Com graficos muito pobres e fotos amadoras mostrando ora a pipa ora o kitesurfer, mas dificilmente a ambos numa mesma foto senao durate um salto. Portanto no dispoem dos recursos da fotografia didática (que exige perícia na preparao em se tratando de kite pois quando se tem separados o kitesurfista da pipa nunca se sabe o que esta acontecendo com o lado que nao eh mostrado) além de demorar explicando as diferencas entre os modelos para a agua ou para a terra e entre os kites de 2 linhas e os de 4 linhas."
3,A Very good INEXPENSIVE seat,"Pretty comfortable and inexpensive. Quality is not bad. Again, unbeatable value for the money."
3,Dream etymologies,"I thought the book did an excellent job in interpreting what dreams mean and projecting that knowledge to the reader. Though the editor and whomever could have done a better job in making the book more interesting, thus making the whole dream world a better world"
5,Simple and Beautiful!!,I love genuine stone...the color is rich and pure! I absolutely love the bracelet it is beautiful and simple. I love the softness of the color and how it looks against my skin.
5,Seriously?,"All you people who think this album is ""ok,"" well then you don't know what the Chili's are all about. They're are defiantally better at playing Funk/Rock then what they're doing now. But, even if you don't really like this album you have to like Flea's kickass bass lines."
3,Wizard of Oz,"After listening to this album, I have decided that the Flying Monkeys in The Wizard of Oz formed a band called The Red Hot Chili Peppers"
4,Good but not a Great Album,"This is probably their weakest album. Although it contains classics like True Men Don't Kill Coyotes and Get Up and Jump, it would of been better if Hillel Slovak and Jack Irons were in it. It has other great tunes like the instrumental Grand Pappy Du Plenty, Police Helicopter, Baby Appeal, and Green Heaven. It also has the first peppers song ever written, Out in La. These versions don't compare to the ones on the CD Out in La, though since they had Hillel and Jack in them. Still this album is recommended to anyone who wants to dig deeper into the bands catalog."
4,A great debut,"The very first album by RHCP & very different from the art collecting RHCP of today.Unfortunately since it was the mid 1980's an era when Hair Metal was at its peak and so was Wham (god help us), the album sold poorly. Even though this album doesn't hold a candle to Freaky Stylie, Mothers Milk and Blood Sugar sex magic this is a great debut with some RHCP essentials like True men Don't Kill Coyotes, Why don't you love me, Green Haven and get up and jump.There are a few hitches with the album such as Anthony Kiedis sounds drugged sometimes when he sings and also the guitarist Jack Sherman is mediocre and has no heart in his guitar playing like their original guitarist Hillel Slovak who decided to not record the album at the time. I would recommend this album to a RHCP fan but if you are starting out on this band I recommend the other albums that I have mentioned above."
3,"People, get real...5 stars????","I love the Chili Peppers, have all their albums and videos, and have seen them in concert many times. In fact, they are probably my favorite band of all time. This album, their first, is fun, but it ain't worth no 5 stars. It's interesting to hear the beginning of the Peppers' sound and how it has since developed and matured. But the songwriting is weak compared to later albums, and the playing is merely adequate. With each successive album, the band got better and better. I would give Freaky Styley 4 stars and everything else 5 stars, except for One Hot Minute which was disappointing. This debut album is, at most, 3 stars. But Peppers' fans should own it anyway."
5,Red Hot!,Red Hot and raw!! Loved it 25 years ago and still do! Super funky. Definitely in high rotation on my ipod :)
4,Nice debut from the Chili Peppers,"The Red Hot Chili Peppers` self titled debut is like a lot of bands` debut albums. The band showcases the Chili Peppers` unique blend of hard rock and funk in a raw, youthful manner. Obviously the songs wasn`t all that polished and the songwriting pretty immature at times, but you get a glimpse of the Chili Peppers` greatness listening to them. Favorite songs: True Men Don`t Kill Coyotes and Get Up and Jump."
4,The Great Debut,"The Red Hot Chili Peppers's self-titled debut CD is a good one. The charisma and flare that would show up later in their music is all evident in this first release. It's a good one to have just to see where the group came from.There are plenty of good songs on this release: True Men Don't Kill Coyotes, Get Up And Jump, Why Don't You Love Me, Green Heaven, Mommy Where's Daddy, and Grand Pappy Du Plenty.Definitely Recommended."
3,The founding Pepper's set forth to funk you out,"You cant compare this CD to BSSM or Californication, its a different style. It's an album done by some wild kids that's supposed to be a fast funky crazy album; And it got the job done. I would actually give it 3 1/2 stars if i could"
3,"My son really likes it, but...",My son was really into Mortal Combat and wanted this game. We got it and he loves it but thinks its a little too hard. We delved a little deeper and read a lot of reviews where players said the same thing - it's too hard.
2,The Graphics are not that great!,"My children liked the characters and game, but the graphics were just very poor in the Nintendo Ds. Do not highly recommend."
5,loads of fun with a little practice,I am new to the mk series my first Mk was the 3rd one not ultimate. I decided to pick this game up at my local Video game store 15 used. When I turn my Ds on it was a trip down memory lane. Sure some people say it's chessey or lame graphics. I considre it magic. I recommend this game to mk fans and new comers alike but beware this game can get hard after the 4th level. At first I barley made it to th 3rd level with a little practice I did fattalties and combos. I then made it to the boss kahn and beat him. Great game great buy .
4,Wonderful Mortal Kombat Game,It reminded me of the old Game Genesis versions of the Mortal Kombat games. Yet it was a bit more advance as it also had this Puzzle Kombat from Deadly Alliance.
1,Game didnt even play in DS,I ordered this game and it never played in the DS for some reason...very upset..the DS plays all other games but not this one
4,Need more songs by Me on the CD,"I found the CD quite enjoyable for the 1st four and a half minutes , but after that it left me longing for more Mic Nuggette music. He is such a talented bassist and I was hoping his songs ""Piano Maze"" and ""Happy Song part II"" would of been included on the release of the CD. I know he has a small cameo in this film also. I was quite fortunate to meet him while he was on tour with Randy Quaid a few summer's ago. I also saw him play a one finger bass solo once live and was blown away. He is definatley Canada's best kept secret.Buxx Banner"
3,Decent CD but best song missing,"The scene where Tiffani-Amber thiessen is doing a dance for crawl for his bachelor party at the bar. She selects the song T-R-O-U-B-L-E by Travis Tritt on the Juke Box, but for whatever reason the song is not on the son-in-law soundtrack. You'd have to get his album which is the same name as the song. It was released in 1992."
1,True Grit from Movie Mars,"Can't even watch it as it is not coded for the USA. It is coded Region 2. I guess I was supposed to watch for those kinds of codes. Had no idea they existed. I have no idea why this is even sold in the USA if it is not able to be viewed here. I understand they ship all over the world, but knowing that it is being sold to someone in the US should qualify for an email to warn you that you won't be able to watch your video. Love the show, but planned to have it for a big party and were not able to see it."
1,Bad DVD,I suppose the movie was good for an old western however the quality of the DVD was lacking. There was a section of about 10 minutes where the quality was so bad that we we not able to view it.
4,"""True Grit"" satisfies","4-1/2 stars. John Wayne could do comedy like no one else. Who knew? His interactions with a fine Kim Darby are the heart of the film, and are memorable (""corn nubbin!""). Good ensemble acting, good story, good directing (ol' Henry Hathaway), good scenery. One of the last great westerns ever made. Duke's Oscar, and good for him. Now go watch ""The Shootist."""
3,Lazy Transfer,"I was hoping for the Blu-Ray Paramount would do something other than basically duplicate thelast DVD transfer, with it's tired color. One would hope they would at least use a referenceDye transfer print to attempt to match the color to the way the film would have appeared in the1969 release...something they are totally able to do now, but no. All the sharpness of a Blu-rayis here, of course...otherwise an uninspired transfer."
3,"John Wayne is outstanding, but","John Wayne is outstanding, but I just can't get by Kim Darby and singer Glen Campbell in this movie. Their performances - well, characters actually - really ruin and otherwise great movie."
5,John Wayne's True Grit,The movie is good. Hard to find in stores. Husband wanted it to see where he hunts in Colorado where the film was made need Gunnison.
5,WAYNE IS GREAT IN WESTERN CLASSIC!,"""True Grit"" is another classic film in the legendary career of John Wayne. His portrayal of the ""one-eyed fat man,"" Rooster Cogburn, is one of the Duke's finest performances. The supporting cast is commendable as well, including the always-fantastic Robert Duvall as 'Lucky' Ned Pepper. Terrific action sequences, stunning cinematography, and excellent storytelling help to enhance the Duke's amazing performance.The DVD presents the film with good picture and excellent audio. And while the only extra is the theatrical trailer, it is still a must-own DVD. Fans of John Wayne will not want to miss ""True Grit.""Movie/DVD Grade: A+"
4,True G rit,This ia wonderful movie. To own it on BluRay is a new and exciting experience!! I highly recommend purchasing a blu-ray copy.
1,one of the worst jw flick!,"purchased this movie,out of curiosity,as i was intrigued on why DUSTIN HOFFMAN AND JOIN VOIGHT, were denied the Oscar's Best Actor trophy for their superb acting in THE MIDNIGHT COWBOY,in favor of the late JOHN WAYNE.It seemed that the ACADEMY made a travesty of justice for DH and JV.WIth due respect,Mr JW,DIDNT deserve to win that award.I didnt finish this flcik (TG),as i was pestered by the young lesbianic gal,who wanted to show the world that she is better than anybody else.I love JW movies,but not this one!"
1,"Oh, was John Wayne in this movie?","The only good role Kim Darby ever had was in Better Off Dead. I would not say this was a good western, or even a good John Wayne movie for that matter; because of the prudish little prima donna girl that occupies the majority of the scenes. Kim Darby had the leading role in it, not John Wayne; and even with anticipating his arrival onscreen a half-hour into it, I became so bothered by Mattie Ross's (Kim Darby) repugnant character that I almost gave up on it. Anyone who has seen it will know what I mean. She must have said a variation on the murderer's name, ""Tom Chaney"", around fifty times in the film. Watch one of Wayne's better films."
1,Another Boring John Wayne,"This movie is so naive and predicable. Boring and boring. I'd rather watch ""Angel and the Badman"". Like Gail Russell, but she died so young."
4,True Grit,"Really enjoyed this western, I would purchase this film for repeated viewings. Kept my interest and story line very good"
5,what moron came up with the blue ray cover?,"Given that companies have difficulty selling B&W; DVDs (which is why they put colorized box covers on B&W; DVDs), why on earth would someone put a B&W; lookingblue-ray box cover on this color film? Talk about shooting yourself in the foot, sales-wise.The film, for all its flaws, is great, however. Far better than this year's ""remake""."
5,John Wayne at his best,"Just about the best western out there! John Wayne at his best. Great plot, well made. Watch it!"
1,True Grit [Region 2],"I am not able to give a review, because it will not play on my DVD player.It says check region code.Ordered on April 29, did not get until 5 May."
1,True Grit,"First off, I love the movie and the actor and this review deals ONLY with the company that provided the DVD.First it took a long time (almost 3 weeks) to get the DVD and then when it arrived the DVD was made for a different region and wouldn't play in my DVD player...I hope someone at that company made an honest mistake and they really aren't this incompetetant!I tossed out the DVD since it would have cost like 5 times the amount to send it back than what I paid for it.****NOTICE**** Be advised that if you buy from this company they MIGHT send you a DVD made for a different region in the world and if that happens it won't play in your player either."
1,Not as described,"I was very disappointed with this purchase. I ordered three movies and the other two were fine, however, this dvd would not play in my region. I was advised that it was because I purchased a dvd that would not playback on DVD players in the United States. I don't understand why someone would think that I would want such a DVD when the other two that I purchased would playback in the U.S. Then when I had to return the item, I was advised that I would have to pay for the shipping to return it. RIDICULOUS! IF YOU ARE GOING TO SELL DVD'S that don't playback in the U.S. THEN LABEL THEM IN BOLD!!! THIS DVD WILL NOT PLAYBACK ON U.S. DEVICES."
4,Picture and Video,"The picture and countryside was well done as in the original movie, and the plot is on the same lines with a twist, but fine! I liked the movie!"
4,Great John Wayne,"This film is not to be compared to the True Grit of Jeff Bridges. In it's day, John Wayne's True Grit was a good movie. I can see that Wayne was laboring in parts; older, but he played a convincing role anyway. It's sure to. Be a classic, if it is not already. Watch the newer version of Grit, too. Jeff Bridges plays a great part."
5,Duke,"Loved this movie and it is certainly much better than the new version. Better colors, better true action. Duke reigns!"
2,Blu Ray Video Quality is Poor,"This is a review of the PQ of the newly released blu ray of the original True Grit.There is so much edge enhancement applied to the picture that it appears fake, more like overprocessed video than film. I found it very distracting through the entire movie, and would never choose to watch this blu ray again. Not unless it was remastered properly and reissued (not likely).Stay away from this blu ray release. At the very least, rent it before you buy it to avoid disappointment."
4,Watch the original!,"I'm not really a fan of westerns in general, but I decided to give the newer version of ""True Grit"" a chance. I didn't really like it. My dad recommended I watch this one instead. To make a long story short, I REALLY preferred this version. Unlike the remake, the goal here was to tell a wonderful story, and they succeeded wholeheartedly. I am writing this review because I wish more people would check out this version, John Wayne's version, instead."
4,music score -not! Update,"Great story, good acting by Darby and Wayne, Duvall, Campbell so-so, beautiful scenery well shot.But -the music is overwhelming and borders on corny. If only there were a way to lower the music without lowering the dialogue.Update 1/8/12: I just watched the 2010 version and am disappointed by it. So much of the story was left out if the viewer hadn'tread the book some parts are not clear. Too much 'action' not enough story line. At least the music wasn't overwhelming this time.Although I liked its ending more as it was truer to the book, a little more narrative dialogue could have clarifiedwhy she called James 'trash'. Oh well."
4,Not up to the hype,"This movie came out during the time I was in Vietnam on my second tour. At that time and ever since I have heard what a wonderful movie it was and how great John Wayne's and Kim Darby's acting was. I just didn't find Kim Darby's character authentic nor anything special about the way she presented it. John Wayne's acting was especially good and so was that of some of the actors with smaller parts like Robert Duvall. But, Glen Campbell? It just didn't work for me. I found ""Rooster Cogburn"" to be a much better movie as well as more enjoyable."
2,Misleading description,Movie plays on blue-ray but is a low quality copy of a standard DVD. The picture is not as good as most DVDs and the sound is not even 5-1. You are better off to buy a standard DVD that was made by a reputable company.
4,Duke is Rooster Cogburn in True Grit,"John ""Duke"" Wayne is Rooster Cogburn in "" True Grit"". Duke has a great time playing the one eyed lawman with grit. Wayne does a great job lampooning some of the many cowboy roles he had in the movies. His director, Henry Hathaway told Duke to listen to him and he promised that Duke would win an Oscar. Hathaway was right on the money.The only complaint I have with ""True Grit"" was Glen Campbell as LaBeauf . Campbell's acting is just awful. He even crinkles his nose when he delivers his lines.The Coen brothers remake is very good but the script adheres very closely to the Charles Portis novel.The story is filled with old fashioned English and the tone is much darker. Jeff Bridges, Matt Damon and Hallie Steinfeld are outstanding.If I had to choose, I would still pick Duke's version."
4,How to fix image quality,"I had the same problem with image quality as previously posted by another reviewer on May 27, 2007. Mine was blurred, NOT in 2.35:1 and the ""Enhanced"" setting did not work on my DVD player. Here is what I had to do to fix the image quality problem: go back to startup DVD menu before you select ""Play"" and change your ""Display"" to ""4:3 Letterbox""."
5,"See This instead of the ""remake"" True Grit-The Duke John Wayne-The Best.","Although I am partial to Mclintock and other Wayne Movies,I really liked this movie and prefer the Original to the ""remake"". The Remake what I like is the girl is annoying but less so and least she looks like a girl instead of a tomboy.But Bridges?Instead of Wayne?No Way.John Wayne movie any day,Any movie that is Politically Incorrect while Patriotic is good for me.The Scenery,the Acting all great."
5,true grit,"I was glad to find this, as a gift it was reasonably priced and the person receiving it was just plain old happy. Thanks"
4,True Grit (1969),Classic John Wayne. Excellent supporting cast with men who were rising stars at the time. Oscar winner for the duke playing a rather complicated character full of both good and bad. A realist's Western.
5,Must have Classic,Bought it to compare with new recent remake. Loved both films. Should be in everyone's collection! The more John Wayne the better.
4,Warts and all,"Portis' novel should have been left alone; translating it to the screen only highlights the failure of so many people to understand that, in the 19th Century (and probably earlier), written speech was always formal and correct - unlike spoken language. Do people really believe that the contraction wasn't invented until the 20th Century? All that being said, ""True Grit"" has two final acts that are wonderful - they got ME to buy a copy of the movie. While the final act is moving, the one just before is thrilling AND moving."
5,Wake up call,"I purchased this book for two reasons: 1. I was hoping to learn the causes behind the horrors of the Postal service. And from this book I did. 2. I wanted to know if the environment in my workplace was similiar. And although perhaps no as bad there are a lot of similiar situations. It truly saddens me that these government facilities are being so neglectful to the needs of their employees and their environment. I guess that old saying is true ""Its only going to bother them or become a concern with them when it affects them."" Definitely a good read, especially if you can handle the truth!!!"
1,Sad Seiko,"She is just trying too hard to success in USA and her new album is not good enough. Originally she is good at ballad but somehow in USA what she does is all dance music, which is totally different style from her original style in Japan. I listened to all these songs but....sorry Seiko, you should come back to Japan and had better sing songs only for Japanese fun..."
5,Fantastic!,"I really enjoyed this song. It's graceful and beautiful. And if, for some reason, you get tired of it, this disk packs some tight remixes. I havent stoped listening to this ""single"" since I got it. Debelah's vocal talent is demonstrated excellently in this song. No wonder she is so big in other countrys!If the song has any flaws, It would be its cost. Nontheless, I suggest it, as it is of extremly high quality. I can't wait until she releases her new album ""Dance with me"". Hopefully she'll put ""I love you"" on her upcoming album. if so, you have no excuse but to check this awesome song out!"
4,charcoal activated.,"I bought a different brand that had better directions: Not to take these pills 3-4 hours before or after meals. Not to take them with other medication. This brand worked fine, but did not give clear directions."
4,Good value and a custom fit,"I picked this up for my ford truck. The tan was a perfect match for my ""Eddie Bauer"" edition. It looks good on the dash and the price was great. Why not 5 stars?The weight of the cover was lighter than I expected, it is a velour type fabric on a light weight foam backing. The contouring is done via stitching in the right spots and the cut outs for the vents are, well, just cut outs. Since the cover is so light, I had to put it on the dash and kind of streatch it so the defroster holes lined up then I weighted it down over night until it relaxed into the correct shape (it came folded). I chose to not use the velcro sticky tabs on my dash."
4,Fiesta,"For anyone who likes old Hollywood movies this is a bright and breezy film, not to be confused with the Esther Williams film of the same name."
5,Great Remixes,"Excellent variations on familiar songs. Although you may not want to listen through the whole album at once since doing so may be boring (there are several versions of one song in a row), you'll probably easily locate you favorite. I, for one, like some of the remixes almost better than the originals."
4,a family affair,i really like their songs which are gospel in intent yet can be considered love songs in the r&b genre.
1,Poor seller,"Unfortunately, you don't get what you pay for. I ordered these brackets and they never arrived. Then the seller refused to replace the ones that I paid for and never received. They are priced cheap, but if you never get them that makes them kind of expensive. Try another seller."
4,It brought the Beatles experience to life for me again.,"I had been a Beatles fan for a long time and still listen to their music as much as possible. I always wondered if I might have turned out different if the Beatles didn't come out when they did. After reading AS I WRITE THIS LETTER I have a new appreciation for just how wide spread the Beatles influence was and still is. Most of the letters are from fans who grew up with the Beatles, but I was amazed at the number of "" kids "" born years after the Beatles broke up. The illustrations from fans go great with the letters. The book is a labor of love by Catone, but not too schmaltzy. I endorse this book for anyone who wants to find what the Beatles meant to us."
4,A Generation Speaks,"Mr. Catone's collection of letters from Beatle fans is the definitive book for anyone who is curious about the fab four's effect on a generation. Catone does a great job placing the letters into different chapters reflecting on life changes influenced by the Beatles, the pursuit of careers devoted to peace, and positive change. The illustrations by artists (fans) beautifully frame the book. I highly recommend this book for Beatle fans of all ages."
4,Changing the World,"They claimed to not want to change the world, but they did nonetheless. Those of us who grew up with the British Invasion were fortunate enough to see and hear our world redefined in this blinding and bewildering moment. Marc Catone shares his skill as a writer and his passion for that time in a way that both connects with and speaks for those who experienced it with him. It makes us wonder what became of the young, impressionable writers whose stories Catone embraces and shares with compassion and insight. Do they still remember where they were when they first heard ""Sgt. Pepper""? Did they survive that turbulent era at all? Catone reaches across the generations to reacquaint their younger selves with us, our children and grandchildren in an insightful and pure manner. This book is a job well done; a rich legacy of a defining moment."
3,Facinating,Most of his writings are at a time between the first and second world war....It's amazing how history repeats itself. I look back and wonder what we have learned over time. It was interesting to see how the prejudice of the Jews started to gain momentum even before Hitlers' reign. It just goes to show how society's subtle prejudices towards others need to be transparent and dealt with at the time in a just way. Einstein's humble but strong character impressed me.
4,More than just a scientific genius...,"Albert Einstein will always be remembered as one of the great minds of our time. But not too many people think of him as a great societal thinker as well. Albert delves into many touchy subjects in this book (having grown up during the most devastating era mankind has ever known).The one downside to this book is that there are a few (only a few) passages where you really don't know who he is talking to, and little reference is given on these to help you, the reader, figure them out.I was thoroughly impressed that this genius, mental marvel of the 20th century could convey his message so clearly in most of the essays and writings. He talks about religion, minorities, war, and other issues facing humaity today that are highly debated in all circles.A good buy, a great mind."
1,not a wise choice,"The content is good, but I don't recommend you buy it. This book has been released in the public domain so you can download it for free. In addition, as mentioned in other people's comments, you may want to consider ""Ideas and Opinions"", which is a much more comprehensive collection."
5,Brilliant Scientist and Great Humanitarian,"Albert Einstein as I see it was one of the greatest humanitarians that ever lived. His brilliance and simplicity of thought shines through on many of his complex theories. You come away saying ""Why didn't I think of that? It is so simple!"" Einstein's humor is dazzling to match and rounds out my perception of this wonderful unique human being. I enjoyed this book."
3,Ok,"Found this book ok not riveting, did give an insight into how the grey haired fellow thought about the world at that particular era. Interesting history lesson for me.Was he a Resentful person HHHMMMM."
3,Not what I expected,I got this book because I wanted a little more background on one of my heros... well this is not the book you want. It's letters that he has written not a biography. Glad I bought it just to see how he was back then but it was kind of tough to get through because it wasnt that interesting.
3,Interesting read,"I can't read Einstein's mathematical language, but here we can see how the big thinker's mind worked on social issues and much more. I simply wish the period of his life covered was much broader, and that each topic was dated for historical referencing. I found it interesting but with a lot of material that included that didn't interest me much as well. Altogether a look into the mind of the great physicist and humanitarian, which helped to comprehend the man that became a legend."
3,Einstein Book,It is a collection of shorts and letters he wrote. It helps you to see how he viewed the world during his time period. You get a good feel for him as a person. Wording is simple and easy to follow
1,Not What You'd Expect,"If you're expecting to hear Thomas Jefferson Kaye as you know him to sound from his two solo albums, the self-titled and ""First Grade"" then you will be as greatly disappointed in this CD as I am. It hardly even sounds like him. And I can't even get passed the vocal sound to enjoy what may well be good tunes. Wish I had never bought this CD and left my memory of him with the other two albums. And this all comes from one of his bigest fans."
4,Oldie but a Goodie,"This album was the shizzle back in the day. It has some great classics humorously spit by Hi-C and produced by DJ Quik. Puppet is a classic tune that some may remember from radio play. There are some rounchy lyrics as Quik's crew has been known for. For someone who never listened to older Quik, Hi-C, 2nd II None, or Penthouse PLayers Clique, this may not be for you. But for those who enjoyed it all in the early 90's, you'll love it."
4,Classic 90's Nasty Rap,"I bought this along with the AMG ""B!tch Betta Have My Money"". I forgot how much I love these guys. I haven't taken Skanless out of my cd player since I got it last month. 2 Ada Time and Too Drunk to F!ck are hilarious. If you like Too Short! or Eazy E you will be into Hi-C and the Skanless crew.BTW-DJ Quik & AMG have an album coming out under the group name The Fixxers. Can You Work Wit Dat is the single that's on the radio. It's awesome. I have it as my cell ringtone."
4,An interesting assortment...,"All of these photos try to capture a moment in history that most people are probably still trying to digest, myself included. This is a comprehensive look at that day, although I have to admit there are some graphic photos that I could probably have lived without ever seeing. I will keep this book to show my children and my grandchildren so that they will know what I saw that day."
5,9/11 as it happened,"What happened on 9/11 was horrific, stunning and chilling. This book shows you what the scene was on that day and the days afterwards. Many comments have been made about the 1 photo of the unbelievable horror that occured that day. Yes, there was no sticker to tell you it was coming, but do you really think a book about 9/11 wouldn't include some photos that make us all disgusted? I have found too many publications that whitewash the event so as not to offend, but we lose our desire not to let it happen again as it becomes a distant memory. Many in this country have already forgotten that day and what it felt like and how sickening it was and if this book, however small, makes us remember how we felt that day and how proud we were to be Americans, then it is worth it over 1 photo."
5,Great CD!,"I cannot understand why these two women are not big stars. I bought this CD for .92, because I needed to find a song entitled ""Circle of Love"". Not expecting much from a .92 CD.I was wonderfully surprised when I listened to the entire CD. My favorite song is Real Bad Mood..makes me forget my bad mood (when I'm in one!). It has a country feel, without all the country twang. How about more of the Marie Sisters!"
3,"Not as shown in picture, but as described","The image seems to show paper with 5 sections/lines horizontally across the paper. The actual paper is just like notebook paper, regular ruled, with no holes."
3,live cut of Mean Mistreater very difficult to listen to,"An overall 3 stars from a person who grew up listening to GFR. Mark Farmer's vocals still make this a good CD, but some of the cuts, especially the live cut of Mean Mistreater, was very difficult to listen to. Still if you are a GDR fan, the CD is worth the price."
4,Play that Funk-y Music,"Back in the bad ol' 1970s, Grand Funk was one of the heaviest (and most popular) bands around. Along with Bachman Turner Overdrive, they defined the sweaty, blue-collar hard rock sound that was the antithesis of such egg-headed contemporaries as Yes and Emmerson, Lake and Palmer. This single disc collection gathers just about all the Funk worth hearing in one economically priced package.The disc includes all of the Funk standards, the anthemic ""We're an American Band,"" ""Mean Mistreater,"" ""Shining On,"" the bowlderdized covers of Traffic's ""Feelin' Alright,"" the Stones's ""Gimmie Shelter,"" Little Eva's ""The Loco-Motion"" and the reworking of ""Walk Like a Man."" This collection gets bonus points for containing the full length (over ten minute) ""I'm Your Captain/Closer to Home"" and the last big funk single, ""Some Kind of Wonderful,"" that was left off of most earlier Funk anthologies.Overall, a fine representative collection from a band that virtually defines the term 70's nostalgia."
1,Worst product- ever,"I bought this product at Home Depot and it was a total waste of money! I have bought the product by Artscape and had great results, easy to install, looked professional. I thought this would be similar--it wasn't. It cracked, slid around, wouldn't adhere, and when I tried to remove it, it left a sticky residue that I can't get off!!! Going to back to store."
2,There are MUCH better ways than this,"This product cost me $40 for 2 rolls, 4 hours 'install' time and 2 hours cleanup after the attempt ultimately failed. Gila film is very difficult to use, especially on larger windows. And good luck getting it off - hint - use paint thinner and a wide razor blade. I did 3 of 6 windows, gave up, took it all off and purchased spray-on frost instead to do all 6 windows. Save yourself some trouble and look for other options for getting privacy."
1,Major Fail,"I bought this film and followed the instructions precisely. I ended up with a ball of plastic that was torn and stuck to itself. It would not go onto the window without wrinkles and bubbles and the backing would not come loose in one piece. After struggling with it for almost an hour, it finally ripped. I'm returning it."
1,Awful Product,"Short Review: AVOID THIS PRODUCTLong Review:I recently purchased this product from a local big box home improvement store. Not only did I waste my $30 in cash, I wasted hours of my time. This is the worst product I think I have ever used. The instructions suggest cutting a slightly over sized piece of material and trimming it during application. This is a mistake as the material tears along a cut VERY easily, and will likely tear right into the area covering the window (this happened on all 3 attempts as I wasted the entire roll). Once I finally got it trimmed (with gouges, tears, and all) I couldn't keep the corners from curling up no matter how hard I tried."
2,Frustrating product!!,"Glad to see I'm not the only one having troubles! this is hands down my most frustrating DIY project and I'm quite a patient person. Good points - I think it does look nice and offers the privacy that we were looking for and the bubbles have been easy to get out.BAD points - I'm doing this on french doors .. so 20 little window panes - OYE .. what was I thinking. I do think this would be easier on 1 big window. Working in these small areas is so difficult and trimming has been my nightmare. I definitely bought my own razor as the one in the pack lasted for about 2 panes. The corners are what drives me nuts - b/c they are NOT sticking. Also, while trimming the small space, it shifts causing it to not be a flush trim job on the other side.Would NOT recommend this product for small panes .. I might consider it for a regular window as from a distance it looks nice .. but up close - a hot mess and terribly frustrating!!! :-("
1,Frosted Window Film,I hated the way this film looks on my door once I put it on. It is not the product I thought I was getting.
4,Not that hard...,"Not quite sure what all the negative reviews are doing wrong. I installed on a sliding glass door, two narrow side panels, and a regular window yesterday. The results look very good - not perfect when studied within an inch of the window, but from any reasonable distance of a foot or more, it looks great. Definitely get the application pack, and definitely use two people. One could probably do a good, job, but would be much more dicey."
1,Avoid all gila films,"Before purchasing this or any of the gila films, I'd read all the reviews. You will save yourself a LOT of money and a LOT of time and a LOT of frustration."
5,"QUALITY, STURDY!","I had suffered from a few bad purchases of cheaply made, easy to bend eye lash curlers. Or one that crinkled my lashes in an odd way. It is gentle, easy to use. It also includes 2 pads for the curler. The extra pad is a bonus. Comfy to use. I love it and use it daily! I would definitely buy this for a friend. NO cheap stuff here!"
3,"As far as eyelash curlers go, I guess ...","As far as eyelash curlers go, I guess this is a good one, but I didn't see enough of a difference using it to justify using it every day. The effect was greater the longer I held it on my lashes, but it was usually gone in about an hour anyway. Overall, I just wasn't very impressed by this product."
3,"When I used it on my left eyelashes, ...","When I used it on my left eyelashes, it kept pulling and it hurt! I'm not sure if it's my eyelashes or the curler, but I've never had problems with pulling with my other eyelash curlers. It seems pretty heavy duty -- it's made out of metal, not plastic -- and it seems like it does a good job on my right eyelashes."
5,This worked really well for me. My eyelashes ...,"This worked really well for me. My eyelashes curled right up -- with others, I've had to squeeze several times."
3,I found the Revlon Eyelash Curler a little ...,"I found the Revlon Eyelash Curler a little hard to use, but once I figured it out, the results were very nice. If a friend was in the market for an eyelash curler, I'd recommend this one. It gives good results and is easy to use, once I figured it out."
4,This product was very effective and easy to ...,"This product was very effective and easy to use. Best of all, it was painless -- it didn't pull my eyelashes at all. Also, the package came with a replacement pad. I'd definitely recommend this product to a friend."
1,Not what was received,"Not what I received. Shouldn't show picture if that is not exact item. Had been looking for this model from revelon as it is no longer available in stores as they came out with another type which is terrible and doesn't work and that is what I received. Futhermore to make matters worse, I sent email to get authorization to send back and never received a response. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!"
5,Excellent Singing,"This CD is a glorious production of some of their most popular duets. I loved it. However, I am a big fan of Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson eddy so what would you expect?"
3,its ok,"i bought this game thinking that it'd be like the sonic from back in the day, but its not. so i guess you could say i'm a little bummed but its my fault for not researching well enough"
2,It's the same old Sonic,"I've never liked Sonic very much. However, when got this game from my wife I decided to give a try. Well, for me it is still not so fun as playing Mario or CTR (Crash Team Race). So, I don't recommend it."
3,Don't really play the game bought it for the kids,"My kids seem to enjoy this game they are ages 6,7,8, and 8, two boy's and two girl's they seem to enjoy it"
4,Good games!,It was cool that there were 2 games in this case. My son has really liked them. A good purchase.
5,Page Turner,This was without a doubt the best book I've ever read. I could not put this book down and read it in one day. The book is very descriptive and well written. I highly recommend this book.
3,A quick read. Compelling after a slow start. Informative.,"This book would probably be most enjoyable for those who have lived during the time of the Korean war. It brings home , in great detail, all that the airmen in training endured, both physically and psychologically. Very enjoyable reading."
1,Incredibly disappointing,"After reading Phantoms in the Brain, I was excited to see another book out by V.S. Ramachandran. Sadly, this book is just a dumbed-down rehash of Phantoms. There are only a few snippets of actual new material in this book and they're not covered in any kind of depth. Additionally, he introduces his own personal opinions regarding the human condition that have nothing to do with the studies of the brain. It doesn't even fit at all into the flow of the book.Don't bother reading this book if you've already read Phantoms in the Brain. But if you haven't read it, I highly, highly recommend Phantoms."
3,too brief,"I'm an Oliver Sack fan of old and was excited to find a similar author. He is a bit more in depth and metaphysical than Sacks and I adored his last book. I looked forward to reading this book. Unfortunately, it was very short and the topics included weren't all that interesting to me. Interesting, but no show stoppers. If it had been longer, I'm sure I would have learned something that really excited me. Try his other books instead."
4,Excellent Book,"This book is awesome, I like Dr. Ramachandran writing style. He has the ability to take a complex subject and explain it in simple terms. I enjoyed reading it."
4,Fascinating reading for anyone interested in the mysteries of the mind,"Though it doesn't give you outright answers to the mysteries of the mind, this book, written by the expert in the field, will certainly give you much to think about! It talks about a bunch of different neurological diseases and how they affect cognitive function, and what that tells us about normal cognitive function! It's an interesting, quick read, similar to the likes of Oliver Sacks' books, but not as repetitive. I recommend it to anyone, science background or not."
2,More Essay then Insight,"If you are looking for an incursion into hypotheses, surmise, and inuendo this book may briefly entertain you. I was looking for some solid scientific insight and was sorely disappointed. In fact, I was even offended at some of the political inuendo that was totally out of place for a ""scientific"" work. Statements like "" ...if raised in ... a culture-free environment (like Texas), we would barely be human ..."" are uncalled for. If this was an attempt at humor, it came across rather as smugness. I will cross this author off of my reading list."
2,Not worth the money!,"Well first off the book has 200 pages, of which only 112 are actual part of the book, the rest are notes, glossary, and index. For the money its not worth it. Alot of repeat and filler."
3,The book got a little bit longer with every turn of the page.,"I was given this book as an award for winning psychology student of the department at my high school. I, as a psychology student, am not a fan of all the neuroscience, and I believe that's why my teacher chose this book for me. It started off interestingly and I really actually enjoyed the first two chapters. However, as the book continued, it just got a little bit longer and harder to read as I moved into later chapters. The author didn't really do a good job of staying on track, fully explaining his ideas, and then explaining them correctly. What made the book even worse was that he puts all of his numerical notes at the end of the book and not as footnotes. Therefore, I had to constantly turn back and forth and save two pages when I stopped reading.I ended up just closing the book instead of reading the last 15 pages because I wasn't happy with the way Ramachandran did this."
2,Great ideas needing a better format,"Dr. Ramachandran is a bonafide original genius. His book does not do justice to his work, however. The long introduction was rather obviously overlaid on previous essays. Either he should take time to organize his books thoroughly or should let one of his acolytes do it for him."
3,No Laughing Matter,"NO LAUGHING MATTER has some great moments. In places Joseph Heller demonstrated his ability to be funny and touching at the same time. The book was a great inspiration to me at a time when I needed the help it gave me. As the author of SOLOMON'S PORCH, a novel about a man with CIDP, the slow version of Guillain Barre', I was fascinated with this book about Joe Heller and his caretakers. Most of the material that I have read about GBS and CIDP focuses almost exclusively on the patient, but Mr. Heller wrote every other chapter of this book and had his friend, who became one of his caretakers, write the alternate chapters. At the time I read NO LAUGHING MATTER, I was beginning to formulate SOLOMON'S PORCH in my mind. NLM gave me some good ideas about structure."
5,Awesome song! - Perfect to make people dance!,"If you're into Armand van Helden wait until you hear DJ Stew. This guy knows how to mix up a song. After such a club anthem as ""Funk Phenomena"", ""Funky Fresh"" measures right up to it. You got to get this cd, it's the absolute bomb!"
5,A handy reference for REXX,This book documents REXX from a practical perspective and has many examples and useful suggestions. It focuses on the syntax and uses of the REXX statements but does not cover EXECIO and environment-specific commands. A good book to have close at hand.
3,Allan,have used bopok as basis for reviewing and programming in REXX on z/OS and z/VM. It helped me a lot in setting up at 'keep alive' check on a z/VM server.
4,Great price for a reasonable sized handy tweezer. ...,Great price for a reasonable sized handy tweezer. I would definitely recommend this product to friends and family. It's very fairly priced and appropriate to the product. I will definitely be using this product in the future as I feel it is durable and reliable.
4,Finally - a tweezer that works! The angle ...,"Finally - a tweezer that works! The angle tip lets you hone in on that one annoying and really short hair that's driving you absolutely crazy. At least that's the way it is with me. The tweezer grabs and holds tight and allows you to quickly, effortlessly, and painlessly pluck, pluck, and pluck away."
1,These tweezers do not grab the hairs. It ...,These tweezers do not grab the hairs. It takes forever to tweeze your brows. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone.
2,never knew it was library book at one time!,DISAPPIONTED LOOKS AS THOUGH I stole tjis book from a library still has old bookbstamp card stamped in back and plastic cover!
1,Horrible quality,"I received this book and have been using it for about a month now. The quality is horrible, it looks like someone made photo copies of each page and bound them into a book. After reading the first chapter the pages started to come unglued to the binding. Now the first 40 pages from the book are completely unglued and fall out of the book!"
3,Meh...,"This book COMPARES characteristics of men and women such as body language etc. Most of it is stuff you'd hear a comedian talk about, but without the funny delivery..."
5,And Knowing is Half the Battle!!!!!,"No one was more happy to see the return of GI Joe then i was. I grew up with them. I read their comic, I played with their toys, and I watched their cartoon show. i am not ashamed and enjoyed all three immensely. Even now I am older, with less free time, and fewer toys to play with, but still the return of GI Joe left me very excited. This Volume contains the first 4 issues of the new Image comic being published by Devil's Due and I have to say that it is just great!!! The comic brings us up to speed with the GI Joe team who must once again stop Cobra, and Destro, and everyone's favorite maser of disguise Zartan. The stories are all well done, and the art is simply beautiful. Mind you this not a reprint, but all brand new first run stories. So if you are a closet Joe like me. Then do yourself a favor, and pick this one up!!!! Now drop and give me 20!!Yo JOE!!!!"
2,leaves rough edges when cutting,"these do not leave a clean line when you cut nails with them. I'm still using my toddler's ""Safety First"" brand nail clippers (which work very well, but are small and I don't want to wear them out) until I can find some that cut better than this Revlon model."
1,Bought two & neither will cut.,"I thought that perhaps the first was just a fluke, but the replacement performed just as poorly. They won't even cut the thin nails of my 8 year old."
1,Not what Revlon clippers used to be.,"This product wasn't much of an improvement from the old worn out clipper they replaced. Very difficult to cut through the nails, never able to get a clean cut. After 8 months of use they broke. Revlon used to be the clippers that everyone used to buy, they worked the best and lasted the longest. How they have changed. If I had 1 pair it might have been a fluke. Except I purchased 2 pairs and they both broke within 8 months of use, with me using one of them and my wife using the other. I don't think I'll waste my money on Revlon clippers again. Time to look elsewhere for something that works."
1,A poor quality product.,These clippers are now made on the cheap in my opinion. It seems like pretty simple technology -- in fact it probably is harder to mess up manufacturing than it is to get it right but they have done it. You're probably better off going to your neighborhood drug store than buying a pair of clippers from Amazon. The only well reviewed clippers on Amazon are $15 and that doesn't make sense. Very disappointed. Amazon should pull this product as it reflects very poorly on the retailer in my opinion ... and Amazon is almost always my go to website.
1,Cheap junk,"I went to the grocery store to hopefully get a generic one, but only found this one. First time use was okay, but it broke on the second. The cheap metal is really soft and bendable, but apparently brittle enough to break."
2,"Nice ring, not so helpful company","My boyfriend purchased this ring for me for Xmas after looking through my wish list. I was ecstatic when he gave it to me and promptly put it on. Unfortunately, about a week later, the flimsy latch finally gave way after several attempts by me to keep the ring from suddenly popping open. I emailed the company right away to see if I could send it back for repair, and over a week later, have still not received a reply from them.I love this ring and will go to a local jeweler to see if the latch can be repaired, but am very upset that I have not heard back from Silver Insanity. I would definitely think twice before purchasing any of their products again."
1,Not up to snuff anymore,"This was the coolest thing I loaded on my Palm after I first got it from amazon. But I later discovered that far better solutions exist on the market from other companys like bluenomad software and cutting edge software. Since my copy was free, it wasn't bad, but noone should spend any money on this product when such great alternatives as quickoffice and wordsmith are available for much less money and have much better features. There is no real formatting in the word processor, you can't set the font, the spreadsheet frequently looses information, and stuff.But for first time users, it is a nice way to see what the Palm can do I think.Eddie"
1,Speechless,"BMG sent me this by mistake and I have never heard of the band so I thought I'd give it a listen. I couldn't even finish a single track, let alone the entire album. All I heard was the same generic rock (can this be classified as rock?) that has been polluting the music industry in recent years. Where are all the new innovative bands? If this is all kids have to listen to these days I feel sorry for the youth of America."
5,Simple Plan's Better in Hard Rock,"These live renderings of Simple Plan's earliest hit songs are closer to hard rock than the punk rock originals available on their studio albums. I for one like these versions of the songs better than the studio recordings, and unlike many other live CDs - this one's sound quality is excellent - almost as good as when recorded in a closed studio. If you love Simple Plan, then you'll enjoy these revamped versions, and if you didn't like Simple Plan before, then take a listen to these renderings with an open mind and you may discover your new favorite band."
1,empires failed to engage:CD keycode doesnt work,"I have two copies of this game. One from a reputable video gaming store and the last one from amazon last week. Neither keycodes work for either game. I had no trouble with Orion Pirates but have not been able to access this game because of a keycode error. The gaming company will not reply to my email technical support questions and have found no help on chat lines. I am obviously not alon, hence the other reviews. If anyone has a keycode that works PLEASE pass on to us less fortunate souls. Yes, I have tried loading on three different computers with no results. Thanks Gary and Leanna"
1,DO NOT BUY FROM VINDOR,this was a waste of money getting this game so far i have had to get this game replaced twice because the cd keys does not work do not buy this game you are throwing away your money
5,Wrong Song Titles,"The disk seems to be a knock off. The song titles were listed out of sequence. For example, ""Amazing Grace"" which is actually the last song on this disk, is listed as the third song. The music is beautiful, though I don't know why there are vocals on this disk. Also, none of the artists' names are listed. The disk label is obviously not an original because I can see that there are two pieces to it. Thank goodness I didn't give it as a gift to someone!"
2,A dissapointing album...and not reminiscent of PSB at all...,"I was quite dissapointed with this CD. I only listened to it a few times, then decided I couldn't tolerate it any longer. So I discarded it. I found most of the songs on this album, monotonous, flavor-less, melancholic, and very unenjoyable, to say the least. Overall, the songs on this CD are not compatible with my tastes. Very ""un-Pet-Shop-Boys-like and untalented"" describes this album, in a nut-shell."
5,Alternative is brilliant,"This collection of B-sides evokes some of the deepest thoughts and feelings in the Pet Shop Boys, and probably in a lot of their fans. These songs are luscious! The edgiest beats and the most heartfelt ballads are all collected on this set, many of which had been unheard by many fans until this was released. My favorites include ""Jack the Lad"", ""Do I have to?"" ""Violence"" and ""Some Speculation"". A++++++"
2,Not top material,"This is a rather big collection of b-sides and unreleased tracks. There are highlights but also many vague numbers. It would have been better as a compressed collection on 1 cd. The question would still be; What tracks are the best ones? ""It must be obvious"" is a great b-side which really improves the impression of this a-little-to-big collection."
5,"Euro Dance/pop at it's best, this CD showcases their talent.","On this 2 cd collection of B sides there are some really good songs that could of have been singles. Also there are some experimental tracks, some strange and some just damn good. For example the trance sound of ""euroboy"". A must get cd for anybody that likes dance/pop music."
4,80s pop,"Pet Shop Boys is classic 80s style techno music. This is slightly typical of their style, although not their best album."
5,Finally (almost) live!,"When you are a Drake Bell fan, you must own this DVD. And when you don't know him, you'll definitely become a fan after wathing. His music is just amazing and absolutely unique. And this DVD isn't expensive, so you can't go wrong if you buy it!!!!!!!"
4,Go Drake,"If you enjoy Drake Bell, you will enjoy this for your collection. Good sound quality and the songs are all wonderful. There are short interviews with Drake in between each song which is cool. Drake never seems to change outfits."
4,Very good DVD,Great concert. Drake Bell is a very talented musician that is better than most give him credit for due to his tween girl fanbase.I loved the show.
1,A Very Boring Book,I couldn't finish reading the book it was just too boring and kept repeating the same story line. I think this book doesn't really have a point and is basically a waste of time.
4,Interesting Plot,Mary Higgins Clark once again delivered an enjoyable book. It was based on a grown women who killed her mother when she was a child. The characters were well developed as was the story line. There was one part of the mystery which was apparent from almost the beginning but there were some twists.
2,maybe it is me,"I love MHC. I have read most, if not all her books. I am reading this book and I just can not get over this woman would move back to this HOUSE where she killed her mom and the town her dad died ,too. I have been reading this book off and on for months. I just can not get passed how stupid it is to risk everything and be found out.. Yes, she is rich and beautiful and all, but come on get out of town! It is too annoying to think someone would go back and live in the house where all that mayhem took place. I hope I finish reading by Christmas. zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"
2,Can anyone please tell me...,Why some authors now feel it is necessary to switch POV for the newer books? It is so distracting! The plot was predictable and I was hoping for something more impressive from the Queen of suspense.I think she needs to turn in her crown after this one.
3,It was just okay,"Mary Higgins Clark is one of my favorite authors and I have read all the books she has written. I struggled to read this book. I've picked it up a few times to read, but only putting it down to start another book. This time I told myself to start it and to finish it. It was just ok. From the beginning, I realized who the killer was. I thought I would be wrong at the end, thinking she only wanted the reader to think they knew who the person was, only to be shocked at the end. So I kept reading only to realize that I was right all along. I didn't think this was as good as her previous novels. Her writing style was a bit different to me. But, having said that, I'm still a huge fan of hers and will continue to read her future novels."
4,What a fun read,I really enjoyed this book. It was well written and the story was great.Who would have thaought it would end like it did.I like the auther very much.
4,MHC never disappoints,"I really enjoyed this book, I couldn't put it down. Mary Higgins Clark books always point you in one direction and ends up to be another....thats the number one thing that attracted me to her books. Thought Where are the Children & Still Watch were kind of dragging and boring after first few chapters. It was like I was reading her daughters books--which don't compare to her writing. I highly recomend this book to all mystery readers young and old!"
3,No Place Like Home is an ok read.,"It has been awhile since Mary Higgnis Clark has written a book that truly kept my attention. Her most recent books have beena disappointment, in my opinion. The mystery and suspense of her first few novels still compel me to continue to read her books.No Place Like Home has some of the twists and turns of Clark's previous works. The central character, Celia Nolan, returns to her hometown to start a new life with her husbnad, Alex, and son, Jack. This turns out to be a hometown where she was acquitted of murder 20 some years prior to the opening of the story.The plot evolves around vandalism and death; efforts to scare Celia into mental collapse. The who and why behind each act is the mystery behind the novel.Reader, a word of caution. Don't trust anyone!"
1,Sucked! The maine character was a whiner!,"Blah Blah Blah. Shut up already. Read 1/2 the book, just read the predictable ending. This is BS it wasn't written by Mary Higgins Clark it was written by Mary and Carol Higgins Clark. What a total load of BS. If Carol Higgins Clark wants to write, stand on your own two feet. Your mom is in her 70's give her a break. This reminds me of V C Andrewes and the lost novels after her death. So if something happens to Mary Higgins Clark is Carol going to say she found 15 unfinised novels that she will publish under her mothers name?"
2,Read for entertainment,"I read this book to keep me occupied during my son's soccer games and swimming lessons. Not very engaging. I knew the villain right in the very beginning, but just read on to see how the story goes. Usually, I don't take this long, but it took me 3 weeks to complete this book. Just didn't engage me enough to make me stay up and finish it like other MHC books."
3,"Entertaining, but predictable","Similar to another book of MHC ""On the street where you live"", this one is also very predictable.No doubt, it is still an interesting read. MHC linked the infamous Lizzie Bordon's case, and projected the victim here as 'little lizzie'. Her return to the very house that she shot her mother die and attempted to kill the stepfather was a surprise to her. The house was presented to her by her newly married husband, Alex, who is an attorney in NY.On the day she moved in, there were vandalism and threats, all implying someone knows her true identity. Her life and her son's are in danger.Very interesting and entertaining story. However, I could guess the 'bad guy' even at the very beginning. I don't think I have a good detective mind, but MHC's stories have the same traits. Once you read a few, you can almost predict the next one. I'm going to stop reading any of her books for a while, as it starts to lose fun already."
2,Average Home,While I have read better MHC novels. This wasn't so bad. My problem with the novel. That it was so boggled down with details. I almost lost interested in the book. The story doesn't get interesting until the middle of the story. If you can wait that long. This was an okay read invest in Nightime is my Time for more interesting story.
1,The worst book she has ever written,"I was horribly disappointed in this book. Mary Higgins Clark is not known for deep writing but I can count on her to provide a fast paced, suspenseful, and enjoyable book that keeps you guessing. This is most definitely not the case with No Place Like Home. If you are familiar with her work it will be painfully obvious who the bad guy is from the beginning. The coincidences are too much to take and the heroine left me cold."
1,Absurd stinker,I managed to finish the first cd of this audio book. Then rushed to the library to return it. What an absurd idiotic piece of junk.
3,Mary now and then,"Her first novels are her best. Mary Higgins Clark's writing goes bad as she wrote book after book ofer the years. It is fine to read her, of course, but her stories are going the same way - all! I was surprised as I read a time ago, that Brian de Palma would make a film by Higgins Clarks first bopvel ""Where are the children"", but than he cancelled the projekt, because Stephen King's ""Carrie"" calls. ""Carrie"" is a classical horror movie, and how good is it to the film world to have it! But I wish, that de Palma did the Clark-novel, too. He didn't - very sad, because ""Where are the children"" is my< best-love novel by Mary Higgins Clark."
3,"I agree, Good but not Best","I've read every mystery book by MHC. This one is good, but not her best. The coincidences were just too much sometimes. Who did it was not as predictable as I thought it would be, but the final outcome was predictable, but sweet.Still a good read. I enjoyed it."
2,Worst MHC book I've read,"I haven't read many of her newer books but I saw this one in paperback and grabbed it. So disappointing!! The plot was formulaic and the continual, random introduction of a new character without explaining fully their significance was extremely annoying and confusing. I forced myself to read this book thinking that eventually it would hook me; it never did. I usually inhale good books (read in a couple days, a week max) but this one took me three weeks to read. The ending ""twist "" seemed forcibly abrupt and unbelievable. MHC is/was a great author, but I'd recommend sticking with her older books."
2,Not her best,"Mary Higgins Clark's last few novels have been very up and down. One good, the next one not so good. This was not one of the better ones. The plot was far-fetched and easily figured out. The first person writing was not has good as the rest of her third-person writing and really narrowed the focus of the novel.If you want a good book, go back and read one of her early works, but skip this one. I wish I wouldn't have spent the money on the hardback!"
3,Good in parts,"The novel has quite a clever premise and the easy style keeps you reading. My main quibble with Mary Higgins Clark is that her heroines tend to be a bit feeble-minded and the bad guys are irredeemably bad and unbelievable. However, she certainly knows how to write drama. For another great drama set within a ""haunted"" house, tryThe House Next Doorby Anne Rivers Siddons."
5,There is No Place Like Home..,Mary Higgins Clark is by far one of the greatest writers ever - and this book just confirms yet again that she found her true calling in life!True to her reputation - Higgins Clark gives us a story previously untouched.. Imagine the horror of your mother dying infront of your young ten-year-old eyes - and then being accused of murdering her.. You finally are aquitted of the murder and move away and on with your life.. You marry the perfect man - but based on a deathbed promise - you don't tell him about your past.. And as a present he buys you a house.. The same house where your mother died..Before long people start turning up dead - one-by-one - and now your scared that people will recognise and eventually blame you for the murders..Who will you trust?Five out of Five - Excellent easy read!..Always Mirren.
3,Predictable,"You figure out that when you read the jacket, but it was entertaining and good for passing time."
3,Little Lizzie Borden,"Lisa Barton, dubbed, Little Lizzie Borden, after she shot her mother at the tender age of 10 in their family home at One Old Mill Lane, has grown up, changed her name, and married the man of her dreams. Not knowing his wife's true identity, Alex Nolan presents Celia with a house he purchased for her at One Old Mill Lane. Shortly thereafter the Realtor who sold him the house is murdered. Gripping, powerful mystery.Reviewed by Janet Sue Terry, author of the contemporary romance, ""Set Me Free"" series Possibilities and Resolutions. President of Just My best Book Publishing Company. www.janetsueterry.com."
2,Good beach read,"Predictable formula with characters even more dense than usual. Nonetheless, a fine choice when your thinking self is on vacation."
3,Too Short!,"The movie ""Alive"" is one of my all time favorite movies, and I found the music absolutely stunning, so I went out of my way to find the soundtrack CD. How disappointing to find then that from a two-hour movie, they only managed to extract 25-30 minutes of music for the CD. And missing is the haunting ""Ave Maria"" by Aaron Neville from the closing credits, which is the highlight of the soundtrack. I do still love the CD, but it's pretty much over in a half an hour."
5,Unique and Educational,"This book has some of the best illustrations I've seen yet. It's a counting book, so it's very educational. The theme is well-represented and informative. In the back of the book, facts about underwater life are listed.You won't be disappointed!"
5,The Fighter,"I bought this documentary after I had watched the movie The Fighter. The documentary is nothing like what the movie portrays this documentary to be.That said, it is a fantastic documentary about why one should never take drugs. Follows drug addicts on their quest to score drugs by using means of prostitution and serious shop lifting. I plan on showing it to some teenagers in my family because if this doesn't scare them off drugs, I don't know what can!"
3,I could've been a contender,"The real reason, and probably only reason to rent this video is to get a look at Irish Micky Ward's brother Dickie some of this was covered in the Hollywood movie but I want to see it for myself. I actually remember watching it it on HBO in the 90s I wonder if half the people in the movie are still alive also the people in the Hollywood movie the fighter were certainly much better looking than this cast of characters not only does Lowell Massachusetts have a crack problem but someone has been through that town with the ugly stick this is also like a hard-core afterschool special on why not to smoke crack especially if you're ugly to begin with because it's only going to make you uglier respectfully Johnny Irish"
1,DO NOT BUY THESE!,"These are NOT 4.5"" or 5"" tall like dimensions say. They are not even 2"" tall. These are not as protrayed, and I am very unhappy! These are very tiny, do not buy! They are shorter than my pinky. AVOID!"
1,YOU GET 4 SMALL SHAKERS,"I expected 2 shakers about 4 inches high, but I got 4 small shakers about 1.5 inches high. I'll be sending back."
2,These are very small!!!,I didn't realize these are very small salt and pepper shakers. Two sets. I thought it was a set of two (one for salt one for pepper) but instead they are in a small plastic bag with cardboard at the top like it hung on a hook at the dollar store. Very unhappy. They are the size of my thumb.
2,Very small items,"These are very small thumb-sized shakers. I found them to be not what I needed, so sent them back"
2,You've Gotta Be Kidding.... Right?,"Nice CD and hard to find, but folks selling it on amazon for $150.89 and $106.87 for this CD... what a joke!Emosoul"
3,Review from a Spanish Speaker Point of View,"If you want to have an honest opinion of what is missing in this book, I will tell you several things I noticed:. First, it could be better to have some indications in Spanish. The title read ""For Spanish Speakers"". So, I was expecting somebody to speak to me in spanish. There is no single sentence in SPANISH. Second, the tapes only offered some of the exercises listed in the content of the book. This work is NOT COMPLETE. In the other hand, the QUALITY IS EXCELLENT in both the tapes and the book. I still think anyone should buy it. But now with my review anyone can make an informed decision."
2,great singer but not the voice of Elvis,"I think Ronnie Mcdowell work is great, he has a great voicebut not when he does Elvis.I have seen Ronnie in Concert and have most of his music . I also have most of Elvis'music. Whenever I hear an Elvis song done by Ronnie I know it's him right away. You'll never hear Ronnie do Elvis'voice in the harder Rock mode ala ""Hound dog"" orthe Hard blues of ""reconcider baby"" because Elvis had a Gutsy voice. Ronnie has way more vibrato and sings much higher and lighter. He sounds more like Shakin Stevens to me. Listen to Doug Church sometime or some of the other modern Elvis tribute artists if you want to hear the voice of Elvis."
1,I still haven't received it,I still haven't received it so its a bit hard to comment on how good it is. Will comment again when it gets here
5,Great and complex mystery,"Although I read this mystery in a German translation I just love the style Fred Vargas writes in, and want to highly recommend it. The mystery is complex and spell binding, and the characters are convincingly realistic. All the irrationalities and contradictions of the different personalities are presented in a fascinating but not boring detail.I also just finished reading another Fred Vargas novel 'Sous les vents de Neptune', and I am looking for more, to find out, how the American translation is done. However, it seems that not all of her mysteries are translated into English, which is unfortunate"
2,"Decent book, bad translation","I overall liked reading the book, plot etc., however, I did find the ending a bit hasten and forced. The problem I had was with the English used in the translation. The person who translated this book from its original French opted for very unusual and sometimes confusing phrases and expressions. It all sounded very stiff, clumsy and wooden. Almost as if certain expressions used by the author in her native French had been translated directly into English, making it sound artificial."
4,Give John a chance.,"Since this collection came out when I was in high school, it served as my introduction to John Lennon. I knew alot of Beatles before, and I've collected alot of his solo work since, but this gave me my first listens to ""The Balled Of John And Yoko"", ""Jealous Guy"", and my favorite track ""Julia"". The great things about this soundtrack is that it's 21 tracks long, and 20 of them are wonderful. It also gives you some of his Beatles AND solo material. However, that's also where it lacks. In trying to cover both eras, it misses a huge amount of each. It reminds me of that ""Best Of Sting And The Police"" collection. I do love this album, and it is nice for just one discs worth, but I would first recommend ""Lennon Legend"" for his solo years, and of course ""Beatles 1"" if you want just the tip of that iceberg."
3,"Too much Beatles, but not bad","The only thing I was dissapointed about was that Track 1, ""Real Love,"" is NOT the demo that Paul, George, and Ringo used for the Anthology. It is a different acoustic recording. But, ""A Day in the Life"" is good. It doesn't have the cheering at the beginning, or the gibberish at the end, which is good if you want to burn it onto a CD without having to put ""Sgt. Pepper Reprise"" before it. The ""Imagine Rehearsal"" is an interesting track, since it has bits of talking, like The Beatles' Anthologies. They are pretty good songs, but they should have included ""Instant Karma."""
3,I think this might be heresy,"I obtained this album when I was eleven and I already owned most of the Beatles songs. At the time, this album was worth it for the Beatles track I didn't own, ""Give Peace a Chance"" as well as the acoustic version of ""Real Love"" (acoustic versions are always fun) but, in my old age I've really, really come to appreciate ""God"" and ""Mother."" I feel like Lennon could have really taken off in the direction towards which these songs pointed- these songs are personal, raw, and defiantly uncatchy. Not that ""Imagine"" isn't an amazing song that illustrates his genius for blending the personal with the commercial, but in general, I think he could have taken more risks in his post- Plastic Ono Band career. And, you know, I could really do without ""Woman,"" ""Beautiful Boy,"" and ""(Just Like) Starting Over."" But the live version of ""Mother"" really does make the whole thing worth it."
2,a wholy unnecessary collection,"A ""soundtrack"" from a documentary? And what, you're going to make the die-hard John Lennon buy many of these songs for the umpteenth time to get an inferior version of Real Love and the Imagine rehearsal? I suppose if you'd never heard of the Beatles or John Lennon and wanted one CD to introduce you, you might pick this.......all two of you."
5,Good stuff,"This album is the perfect epidemy of anything a person could ever ask for in a CD. Anything you could possibly want is on this album. Easy listening music, insightful lyrics, decent Voorman guitar, the works! It's all here! Flawless album."
2,Over priced,The footage for the dvd is pretty good. Not as much flight footage as you would expect by the title. There is not any naration in the video. just text in between scenes. The underscore is horrible!! It sound like some MIDI organ stuff. Totally kills the enjoyment of the dvd. WAY over priced!
4,"Kudos to Torrence on Reggae ""Barbara Ann""","This Cd from Dean is worth getting for the Vertikals track on Barbara Ann alone. The island feel totally blows me away. Brian Wilson must have his hand in this arrangement with the Vertikals. Who else could come up with a soaring instrumental into the heavens on ... A CLARINET! How do these guys come up with this stuff? Brilliant track, great CD!"
5,Master Builders Review by an Art History Professor,"If you are looking for a book that clearly articulates the style and influences of the major early 20th century architects, this is the book for you. Great for students who need to review stylistic characteristics succinctly for college courses as well as architectural enthusiasts. This book clearly set in context how the personalities of Corbusier, Mies, and Wright and their cultural backgrounds influenced their architectural style. If you need to own one book about these architects, this is it!"
3,"Somewhat disappointing, with a few nice cuts.","I was somewhat disappointed by this album, seeing that most of the albums on either side of it seem to ""get going"" in their early stages. It's a more mellow collection of tunes, some of which are well written (""Beautiful Loser,"" ""Katmandu""), and some of which totally pass by unnoticed. The best track is the down tempo ""Black Night,"" which fits in well alongside his earlier albums. ""Nutbush City Limits"" is a close second, even though it is an Ike and Tina cover song. Most of the rest, though, is softer and, therefore, unformed (since soft rock was not Seger's forte at this time.) This would not be the first place to turn to familiarize yourself with Bob Seger, as it's the most transitional album and much weaker than ""Brand New Morning,"" Seger's previous ""introspective"" album."
2,audio cd,"quality of cd wasn't good but when i contacted the seller they were very good and fast about refunding my money! Would buy from this seller, again!!"
5,I LOVE IT!,"What more could you ask for? 4 great songs, a great cd, all by a great band! Fleetwood Mac RULES!"
4,VERY NICE CD,VWERY NICE CD....SECOND ONE I HAVE BOUGHT.....THE FIRST ONE BROKE.....SO HAD TO HAVE ANOTHER ONE...too soon to tell...is my fav..
5,Nick of Time,A CD everyone should have in their collection. I never tire of hearing Bonnie Raitt's voice.
5,Dinner-party music of the best type,"You're having two couples over to dinner, and loading up the CD player. Be sure to include Nick of Time. The first (title) track pumps smooth energy into the room with a catchy bass line and a catchy tune, and it just gets better. ""Cry on my Shoulder"" gets you down, but ""Real Man"" pumps you up again. All told, a great CD for anyone's pop-country crossover collection."
5,Lucky to have it,"It's been years since I bought this, and I still love it. I love the music and the lyrics. Bonnie Rocks!"
4,Good Solid Disc,this Album is very Good.Bonnie Raitt sounds Good on this set.The Title cut is one of her best ever.Her voice&guitar playing is Solid here.
4,music is life,This album was my introduction to Bonnie. It's good. I have another which was not optimal for me. Bonnie is good with the blues. For beginner's I would recommend this ALB as you can lay back and just enjoy.
1,Ordered vinyl got CD,"I was expecting LP version of Nick of Time by Bonnie Raitt. Checked order info, that's what it says, VINYL. Instead I received a CD of same.Can't trust these guys."
3,Some great songs/Some safe for the supermarket,"The beginning of this recording is not promising, the title track sounds like the worst of soft rock, safe for any supermarket. There are a number of songs that follow this format, (""Cry on my Shoulder,"" ""Have a Heart"" ""Too Soon to Tell"") but the good stuff compensates for the dross. John Hiatt's ""Thing Called Love"" gets a great work out, and Jerry Williams's contributions (""Real Man,"" ""I Will not be Denied"") let Bonnie show she's no softy. Not quite a balanced work, but the good songs make it worthwhile and when Bonnie gets motivated with that slide, a good time is guaranteed."
5,Play On,"I used to have this on a cassette and of course it was ruined by time, so I decided to get the cd. Better sound quality, added with a few memories what a combo. Bonnie is at her prime with this one."
3,Something missing,"This CD is fine as far as it goes. However, there is a Laser disc available of the same title (and cover art) leading one to believe the CD contains the same music. Not true!! There is a great Norton Buffalo tune at the end of the laser disc version which is painfully absent from the CD. Those who've never seen the laser disc version don't know what they're missing!! The CD is still worth the money but I felt somewhat cheated."
2,For The Hardcore Fan,"It's 1978 and after years of gigging in Texas and California, Roky And The Aliens - in preparation of the recording of their debut album The Evil One - find themselves in a rehearsal studio smoking reefer and generally amusing themselves by taking semi-serious stabs at the songs that comprised the soundtrack to their childhoods. And while they seem to have genuine affection for this material, the results are not often pretty. But while some tracks such as ""Angel Baby"" can be hilariously awful (some of these songs are WAY out of Roky's vocal range - not that he seems to care), the medley of What To Do/You're The One/Bashful Bob/One Last Kiss is actually quite good, even stirring at times. Had they made a truly serious attempt at recording it they probably could have easily surpassed the originals, but I'm very glad this version exists at all. Of the half dozen originals on the CD, a studio rendition of ""Wake Up To Rock & Roll""( previously only available live) is a nice addition."
1,Roky Trust Snookers the Fans with This One,"This album is a travesty. It finally puts to rest any doubt that Roky's former Manager has anything of value left. The sound is terrible. The recording processing/mastering is horrible. It's like they recorded this using a Realistic mono condensor mic onto K-Mart, normal bias, cassette tapes and then crapped on these tapes and let *that* sit in a basement for thirty years. Then they just ripped it to CD the cheapest and fastest way. Then they had the balls to talk about how ""great"" this utter piece of sheeeeeit was. This was the old Roky Trust under his brother's helm. Put Roky's little brother, Billy Alienate and Roky's former Manager in a room together and *this* is what they come up with. They are tools and this proves it. Stay away! Are you a Roky fan? STAY AWAY! BACK AWAY SLOWLY!"
3,It is really hard to tell if this works,"The drains seems a little less smellier and faster....but, honestly, it is hard to say whether this product had much to do with it, as the odor was so bad, a friend had to replace all sink pipes.....I think it works, but not for very bad problems,,,,"
5,Beastie Boys don't get boring,After listening to Hello Nasty which i thought suked i got this and loved it. This is a great cd like liscense to ill.
3,Shut yer pie holes and play your samples,"Yeah, I wish there was a version of the album without the Beastie Boys voices because the tracks are excellent. The clever use of disparate samples and the song construction and beats are often surprising and innovative, not to mention funky as hell. The music is sometimes brilliant, kudos to The Dust Brothers. Unfortunately that brilliance makes the Beasties awkward flow and obnoxiously whiny voices stand out like a bad case of acne on prom night. At best The Beasties ""raps"" are amusing, at worst they're annoying as hell. There's a lot of worst on this cd. At this stage of the game the Beastie Boys still come off as a novelty act, albeit a talented one. Its a tragic irony that as they got better as rappers their music got worse. But they had some winners in their catalog, Check Your Head comes immediately to mind. On Paul's Boutique however sometimes I wish they'd just shut the hell up and let the music play."
5,I'm just not even going to try.,"No matter what I say, no matter what words I choose to use to describe this body of work, it will not come within miles of capturing the essence that is Paul's Boutique. However, calling it hip-hop's Dark Side of the Moon or Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band is a good start. To quote Wayne and Garth, ""We're not worthy!"""
3,A so so attempt for white guys to represent hiphop,"Well, I like the concept of this album especially being a DJ. However, the absurdity of the samples' conjunction make this a blend of chaos without an overarching structure. The words are nonsense and if rap is going to mean anything there has to be a consistency of imagery. I recommend this album as an embryo of what hip hop can aspire but it's a horrible failure to make rap a complex, intellectual structure in which political structure is to be read into. I suggest DJ Primo's work or Pete Rock and CL Smooth and Prince Paul for masterpieces of sampling and Nas and Biggie and Gangstarr and Mos Def for storyteller and politicalizing and De La Soul and Handsome Boy Modeling School for the the real humor. Any of that stuff is superior to this brilliant kitsch."
1,The most annoying music I have listened to yet,"I bought this CD based on the Amazon reviews and was also guided to it by the ""people who bought this also bought this"" feature. I am shocked that it got five stars and now I really have to question Amazon's ranking system credibility.I listened to every track and did not find one that I liked. There was an angry tone throughout which I could live with but there was no melody behind the anger and the words had no meaning (at least to me). If this album had been offered with music samples, rest assured I would not have bought it.In summary, if anyone wants this album for free send me an email, I am very anxious to remove it from my collection."
5,"The ""Sgt. Pepper"" of rap albums","I never have liked ""Licence to Ill,"" aside from a few individual tracks (""Girls,"" etc.). When I heard the B-Boys were releasing the long-awaited follow-up, I certainly did not stand in line for it.Flash forward to 1991. A friend of mine whose main musical interest was Sinatra had the ""Paul's Boutique"" cassette in his car. I was stunned. I insulted his tastes. He immediately berated me for being clueless.I certainly was!He told me the record had ended up on Rolling Stone's 10 best albums of the year when it came out. That interested me even further. So, I bought the CD, with having only heard ""Hey, Ladies,"" which even I at the time had to admit was brilliant.So, in short, this is 'the' rap album for people who think they don't like rap. It's been said already that there will never be another album quite like this, and I agree. It's a fabulous cornucopia of styles, samples, lyrical references - and it's all meshed together in one of the best produced albums of any era."
2,review,Bootleg cd. The CD skips on three songs and one of the songs you can't even listen to. It's a never again.
5,greatest album ever. period.,This is hands down the best cd I've ever heard. I've probably listened to it 100 time but I never get sick of it. The music is so densely textured and brilliant. The Beastie Boys will never again match this. It is too bad that after this they became content to release albums with only two good songs on them. oh well.
5,FunKY,I luv this album!!! This is the last Beastie Boys album that I have gotten and I think it's thee best. U never grow tired from listening to it. While ur listeing 2 it u learn sometihng new every other time. WHoa!! Sexy Adam H. and Cute Mike D. Ppl Listen 2 it!!!!~
5,Best Beastie Boys CD,"I'm a big Beastie Boys fan, and though I didn't think Licensed to Ill was that good, everything they've done since has been awesome. This CD has the best collection of cool guitar riff loops. Especially Shake Your Rump (my favorite BB song by far) and Shadrach. They got help from the Dust Brothers, and that's what makes this CD so much cooler than the rest. The Beastie Boys are definitely one-of-a-kind, and this CD is them at their best."
5,Best Rap album ever. period. Brilliant,"Those are the words i used to describe this album. i can't believe i waited this long to review this when i've had it for like almost 6 yrs. anyway, this is one of the best albums of all time and i still can't believe it didn't sell when it came out. it's that brilliant that it was over peoples heads and they slowly realized its brilliance over time and now it sells more than it did then. i'm still amazed by how this album was put together and i think the beasties should team up with the dust brothers again. that would be awesome. even if they did i don't think that they (or any other rap group or artist for that matter) could create anything as brilliant as this ever again."
1,Princeton Review wants your money through a course,I'm taking Princeton review for the LSAT and the books provided for the course make the LSAT understandable and manageable. I purchased the Workout because I wanted extra practice material on the side. The questions are beyond convoluted. I think the book is a ploy to make students feel incompetent resulting in them signing up for a Princeton review course. I'm already in a course so the book was unable to fool me in that aspect because I know the deal about the components of the LSAT already and this book is not what the LSAT truly is. That's just my opinion.
2,FRUSTRATING!!,After consistently scoring between 153-160 on 8 LSAT practice tests (actual tests from years' past)I picked up this book to aid in my studies. It literally brought me to tears when I couldn't even manage to get 24% of the problems correct! It was a completely different format and terribly difficult!! Don't use this book unless you have exhausted all of your other options and really want a challenge. I almost gave up on the LSAT all together. Try Kaplan or Powerscore but definitely NOT McGraw Hill... please read the reviews first on that one!! FULL of errors!!
3,"Very Difficult, But Helpful","I found the Princeton Review products to be much more difficult than the actual test. It helped me to prepare, but until I looked at sample tests and realized this, it had me rather scared of the test. Once I realized that the actual test wasn't going to be as difficult, it allowed me to calm down and prepare better in the knowledge that if I could answer these questions, I could answer anything on the test."
2,This book could suck the chrome off a trailer hitch,"The authors of this book seem to believe that LSAT practice questions must be convoluted, ambiguous and deceptive to the point of frustration. These questions are NOT representative of the actual exam and may actually discourage students rather than build confidence. I expected a lot more of The Princeton Review.Long story short, don't waste your time with this pulp. Find a book with questions that are similar to the actual LSAT."
1,waste of your time,"The questions, like other reviewers have mentioned, are jaw-droppingly difficult. Some people might think that it's good to practice with difficult questions so the easier (i.e. REAL lsat questions) questions will be a cakewalk. Not true - the logic provided in the explanations are so convulted and IRRATIONAL that you will second guess yourself on the real test too much. Try the actual LSAT questions, it's better to get 1 or 2 complex questions right rather than 20 easy questions wrong because you over-thought it. I abandoned this book as I was sifting through the Logical Reasoning section, feeling like an idiot and I finally realized that the book itself was the idiot."
1,WARNING: NOT ACTUAL LSAT QUESTIONS,"I wanted tons of prep questions for the LSAT so I purchased this book, however I found it to be incredibly difficult. After some quick searching online I realized that this book did not contain all LSAT questions, but made up examples of LSAT questions.If you're preparing for this test, do not use this book. All LSAT questions are highly formulaic and the creation of each question is done by LSAC employed test makers. There is definitely a science to the creation of a question and answer set used on the actual LSAT, and this prep book does not reflect this. ONLY PREPARE WITH ACTUAL LSAC PUBLISHED QUESTIONS!"
3,Dissappointing,"After seeing Speedealer when they still had the REO in their name, I was hooked on their hard driving Zeke crosses Motorhead sound. Their first two albums, unfortunately now out of print rocked, and Here comes Death I feel is their best album yet, so I was realy looking foward to the new release. I felt if it was along the same lines of their past album, it could help them break through to getting some airplay. Unfortunately it was a big dissappointment with no stand out songs and a more commercialized sound that is pretty bland for these guys who I know have it in them to blow away all of todays so called heavy bands. I think maybe Jason Newsted was a mistake for producer, come to think of it Metallica was all down hill after he joined up with them. All in all it is worth a listen, but if you are expecting something like their outstanding older songs like Viva La Vulva, Dealers Choice, or Absinthe you'll be let down too."
2,Blah. Just... blah.,"I think every band and artist has a finite amount of creative juice in them, and at some point they run out. It can be really obvious in some cases. *AHEM* Speedealer never really had a lot of ""juice"" to begin with. They were a fun party band, they often played fast and hard, and they had ""Hit It and Run,"" a song which is so catchy it's probably illegal. Well, now they've dried up. There is NO Hit It and Run on this record. (""Kill Myself Tonight"" comes the closest, but it still doesn't come close.) This is just a CD full of bland, middle-of-the-road mid-tempo 'hard rock'. It's generic. It's tepid. It's boring. And it's too bad.PS- Newstead's production work here is pretty damn mediocre, too. At least he's consistent."
3,Simeonidis Review,"The book consists of papers which are writen from many different authors. So , there is an inconsistency in the way it is written. The basic writer has not done anything. He just gave his name....."
4,Buena letra.,"Este cd es bueno, la letras de las cancion es para dedicarselo a una persona oh para escuchar. Recomiendo si quieres escuchard buen merengues ""Devuelveme mi corazon"" de Florangel ""FullMania""...y ""Pasional"" mde Jessica Cristina"""
2,This could have been so much better,"The first part of this video's content was done really well, though the comics being unseen while discussed was a bit more than amateur on the part of the speakers - at the time of recording they were doing homeschool conferences all the time and should have redone this so that they could be seen when they watched the replay and noticed how the were not visible at all. I then concluded that therefore they must be illegally using copyrighted materials in their presentations, however some of the comics that are spoke of in the video turn out to be in their book Logical Fallacies.I don't know why on earth they would put the product out in this condition - as it seems illogical to presenting themselves in such an unprofessional manner. We did get some good tips and insight, but would have been much better off just going straight to the logical fallacies lesson book - which is a great product!"
1,Horrible!,"This was one of the worst presentations I have ever seen. I could have done a better job myself - in my living room. The ""presenters"" simple read their sides, and gave no in-depth teaching helpful insight on logic, and 90% of their material was taken from comics like The Far Side. I saw nothing creative, original or instructive in this DVD. Save your money."
5,Solid '74 effort,I was afraid this wouldnt be good b/c it is still available from outside vendors....dead.net has ALL the DP's still. This is Great though! (DP 20 in comparison really only has one good disc...excellent disc 4)
4,Better than you think,I think this release deserves more credit than people give it. There are way better '74 releases out there. There are a few vocal mistakes and the guitar is a little thin in places but its not terrible. The second set has an odd start. They false start on playin'. I have never heard them do that in the 30 plus shows I have listened to. That being said the ensueing medlody is very good and worth buying this pick. The Morning Dew is very unique. Jerry seams to whisper a lot of the lyrics.
3,Difficult to love,"I'm a recent arrival to Deadhead status - I'd say I deserved that title as of a few months ago when I finally ejected my mix of various artists from my portable CD case, and began filling that case with Dead CD's, including a lot of Dick's Picks.Honestly, this is one of the rougher shows I've ever heard. I bought it without reading any reviews, and I regret that. Between technical problems and some genuinely confused Jerry solos, it seems to me that this show may not quite merit Dick's Pick status. It has its wonderful moments (after all, this is the Grateful Dead,) but there are many much better shows available out there. Also, there are moments here when Donna, (who I usually like,) sounds a bit shrieky. Perhaps the energy was just bad, but this is not one of the legendary shows in my opinion.I've currently been enjoying Dick's Picks 12 - Providence Civic and Boston Garden, June 1974. Far more pleasurable and coherent."
3,A collection of histories,"This book isnothing more than a collection of WW II aviation histories put together in a loosely tied time-line over Europe, 1941-1945. The general result is weak, and it is not a book for those already deeply involved in WW II air combat reading."
2,VERY IRREGULAR AND WITH NO PURPOSE AT ALL !,"This book is very irregular. The writer only put tiogether a bunch of interviews with former combatants of WWII, and focused loosely on the various aspects of the air war in Europe. The best chapter is ""Chivalry in The Clouds"", written by Charles L. Brown, a B-17 commander. The rest is weird."
3,face the music,"This movie was cute, at best. It was predictable and at times unbelieveable. But I expected no less!"
5,A must have,I love Tyler Christopher and this is a great DVD with him in it. I'd watch it over and over again if I could.
1,Trial and error,"I liked the original Hitman, but this game really disappoints. The majority of missions can only be beat be doing something, dying, then doing something different, etc. Since there are a limited number of saves this requires that you do the same thing over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over ...That's not a video game. It's a job. Lame."
3,This no metal gear or splinter cell.........,"One of biggest hurdle of this game is the controls, sometimes this game can get boring, so if you want action then just kill every one in sight or try DEVIL MAY CRY 1 & 3,there's is a wide variety in locations and sometime some scary environments that's realistic and cool, but i can't help myself from saying this game has the moments!!!! when you realise that it's meaninless and lack substance, to keep you focus this game mood must suite you, it not my style however the situation and game play is kinda tacky!!!! i really did not feel motivated to see this game through... but i did it has it's momments and sometimes just for fun you can be a psychotic mass murderer,,,,,,, laterzzzz folks / gamers....."
5,HITMAN,"I ENJOY THE HITMAN GAME I PURCHASED, ITS A DIFFICULT GAME, BUT THATS WHAT I LIKE, IF YOU CAN BEAT A GAME IN ONE NIGHT WHATS THE SENSE? NICE GRAPHICS, SOUND AN ALL AROUND GOOD GAME, I WOULD RECOMMEND!"
3,"good game, bad controls","the hardest part about this game was the contoller. one joystick to move and one to look around was good except if you came under fire. sometimes, the way the contols are set up made it hard to move around and do things, especially if you came under fire. all in all this is a good game but i found the controls hindering gameplay far too much but other than that it is a good game. the sound of the wind through the cathedral, the whistling guard at the top of the stairs all made for a good vibe. the different array of weapons made it interesting. my favorite moment was killing the two men in the park on the third mission via the sniper rifle. the game was at times difficult, in knowing where to go and what to do but it was fun to try different approaches. do i carbomb the limos or hit the cathedral and shoot the men that way? like i said, sometimes the puzzles were hard to execute and the controls are hard to make it through the game but all in all it was ok."
5,If you like GoldenEye or Tom Clancy games you'll like this,"This game is great for either style shoot'em up gamers. You can either be sneaky or basically run through and kill everyone. I do admit some levels are easier than others if you take your time. Good variety of weapons that once you start accumulating them you can pick and choose what ones you'd like to bring along with later missions. Helpful hint... try not to leave the dead bodies laying around if you do have to kill someone, because it seems someone is always walking past them and alerting the gaurds."
5,retiring the mark just got better,"in this game you are a hit man. Blood, Violence, and STRONG SEXUAL CONTENT,pistols, SMGs,sniper rifles, shot guns, and even a golf club, what more can you ask for? This game's the best 5 out of 5."
2,"Graphically Stunning, Yet Virtually Uncontrollable!","I was quite exited while watching the opening cut screens. I was rather disappointed though when I went to the Control Options to see there was absolutely no configuration for my Microsoft Sidewinder Game Pad. How could they possible expect for one to play a game of this caliper using the keyboard only. You'd have to be part human, part ""octopus"" in order to comfortably move, run, shoot, use items, etc. using the MANY, MANY programmable keys on the keyboard. The Graphics were stunning, but I recommend you play both Hitman games on the game console platform like PlayStation, as opposed to trying to enjoy it on a PC. Maybe the developers at Eidos Interactive will add game pad support to the Hitman 3. Stay Tuned!-- A Disgruntled Gamer"
5,what black thinks,"Whoever thought up the idea for a game where you can either use stealth and precision or charge in and kill anyone and everyone, you are God!This game combines great graphics with an outstanding storyline.The weapon selection is awesome too. Eidos also hit the mark dead center with the incredible interactive environments and levels. 47 really plays the part well too.I beg you please make a sequel. Gamers rock on!!!!"
5,"So, you want to be a Hitman?","For those of you who like the fast, shoot 'em up style video game, this may not be for you. This game can be very challenging and requires a strategic thought process to progress. There are many ways to play the game and different difficulty levels to play on. A little frustrating at first, but when you get the controls down, it's on."
1,ANOTHER PIECE OF GARBAGE!,IF YOU WERE BORN WITH 36 FINGERS YOU'LL LOVE THIS GAME. THE KEYBOARD CONTROLS DON'T WORK AND THE FRUSTRATION LEVEL FOR THIS GAME IS OFF THE HOOK. HITMAN CONTRACTS? MAYBE AT THE 99 CENT STORE!
1,crap,I got this game as a gift I gave it back to my friend I did not like this game at all. please rent before you buy.
4,Die Scum!,"/////I owned hitman 1 for PC and i enjoyed it... i admit HM2 is a steroid injected hitman 1 but who doesnt like a doped up hitman....i know i dont.BIGBAD A$$BACK FOR MOREFun game.....I love the first person mode. It opens up the game but most of the levels are tedious and annoying...overall the game has bad camera angles ok gameplay, good fun, tons of new features and better graphics!!Overall RatingsGraphics:94.2%Gameplay:79.4%Fun:82.5%Features:89.9%Overall:85.6%"
1,Too difficult,"I was really excited about renting this game. The graphics are nice, and the idea is great! But the weapon controls are about the worst possible ever. Aim with right stick and fire with R1 ?That was about the worst I have ever experienced and I couldn't shoot myself in the foot by that method. This game ... Obviously the positive reviews were written by the developers."
1,Don't buy this game,"this game is not fun at all. why is it the trend nowadays for games to be boring and extremely difficult???? the controlling sucks. how are you supposed to move forward with one joystick, turn with the other, and shoot with another button all at the same time?? this game is reatrded and a waste of money."
5,Ilaffwaytomuch,"This game is soooo cool. If you love James Bond this is the game for you. I have bought all of the James Bond games and I am a huge fan, but this game is just as cool as James Bond ( but nothing can beat James Bond) You can kill people and take there close ( dont wory they have boxers on) You can turn off the blood too if you like. You can play with all of these really cool guns. like snipers, handguns, shotguns, explosives, and anything that you can you can imagine.The controls are very easy and the graphics are awsome. This game is a must buy."
4,bam bam ur dead,this is the best game in the world.u get 2 shoot people up and drag their bodies around.u also get to steal their clothes.you have 2 buy this game............
4,Close to Greatness,"Well I'm going to be brief and let you know what it's all about. The graphics in Hitman 2 are perfect, but that doesn't regard the game as so. The storyline starts off with a bang, but soon it fades out and you wonder why you are taking part in the missions they give you. The controls are pretty good and so are the A.I. The A.I. aren't stupid but sometimes they'll start shooting at you for no apparent reason and at other times, in the same scenario, they'll just walk on by you. Finally, the gameplay. You can be stealthy and secret as you want in this game, or you can just be a ""mass murderer"" and kill everyone. The game encourages stealthiness, but they also allow you to be a rampant murderer, and it is too easy killing them while they watch you shoot you. Overall I liked the game, but sometimes it ... me off."
4,be a pro in the safety of your own home,"unlike most games where ultra kill is rewarded this game commends you on your professionalism. I am currently in the japan levels and i am pleased with the way this game challeges you. You have multiple methods of dispatching targets(stranglation,poison,etc) and its a matter of time before I gain stealth assasin level. I recomend this to anyone that like s a mental challenge with good gameplay. I try this game in proffesional (hard) mode so i usually do not get to save during a level but overall this game rocks. very hard. usually takes trial and error to surpass and a real kick butt feeling once you do."
4,HydraBrush Toothbrush,"I had this toothbrush on my wishlist, but the price was a bit prohibitive. When it came out on the gold box deal I grabbed it. I like the fact that it has a quicker brush time, and my teeth feel really clean when I finish brushing. I have found the brush head makes a great deal of difference. I liked the soft brushes that came with it but the plastic part kept hitting against my teeth, when I switched to the extra reach, also included, it was a much better fit for me.Unlike other reviewers I haven't had any trouble with the battery life, it lasts a couple of weeks for me. My only real complaint is that I have to be sure to brush before I do my make-up because I do find that this tooth brush is a bit messier than most.All in all I would recommend this brush, just make sure you try different brush heads to get the true ""fit"" for you."
3,hydrabrush,"the rubber guard broke ,trying to put on !!, i hope the rest lasts longer .,it wasnot made in china yaaaa"
3,HydraBrush Express Power Toothvrush,"Like the ease in which you can brush your teeth. The power on the toothbrush is really slow. Even after charging it it runs so slow. Don't feel like I'm getting the job done as much as my crest spin pro. If I could have the power like crest spin pro but have the double brush, I would really be happy.Also Ordered extra brushes and they all seem to be the same. The blue & pink aren't any different that I could tell. Was hoping the stiffer bristle would help make me feel I was doing good job; just can't tell the difference in those either.Don't get me wrong I like the toothbrush, just needs more power to get the needed effect I wanted. Just have to brush longer, as it is now. That's why gave it only 3 stars.(Maybe I picked the wrong one, probably there is one with more power & cheaper, just my luck.)"
1,Very Disappointed with this product,"I read all the reviews, and thought this would be an awesome product to help with my fight against periodontal disease. When I tried to use the brush, you have to bite down as the brush is rotating! I felt as if it was going to chip my teeth, it really freaked me out, I sent it back immediately. I was very disappointed in the product, and lost money when I had to send it back. Think long and hard before you purchse this product."
2,I really wanted this to be wonderful,"I've had it for three months, and my enthusiasm has waned with time.The plusses -1) It hits so many surfaces at once, that it's easier for me to brush my teeth quickly and thoroughly (and I tend to have a short attention span on this important activity).2) My teeth are incredibly clean when I use this, and my gums are, too, to a degree.HOWEVER, the minuses:1) The back-and-forth motion doesn't get under that area of the gums, at the border of the teeth, where much of the bacteria forms, which makes flossing more important with this toothbrush than any electric I've ever encountered, thus mitigiating the time advantage.2) It's not well built, the drip guard broke after two days of use, and the motor always sounds like it's on the verge of collapse.3) It doesn't hold a charge well.4) The brushes don't last long.CONCLUSION:This is a terrific concept, that needs tweaking in the motion of the brushes, and better manufacturing. Until then, I'm moving back to Sonicare."
5,"Hydrabrush is !GREAT!- ""IF"" you get the ""right"" combination...!","1. After the initial 2 months of ""Ultra Soft"" use- I tried the ""Standard Soft"" brushes-Too stiff!- Made my gums sore/bleed ""badly"", and I have healthy gums! RETURNED!2. Ordered more of the Ultra Soft, but bristles were too short to get the gums on my upper front teeth (and I don't have that big of teeth!).a. So I ordered the Ultra Soft ""Extra Reach"" brushes?1. Got the gums on top/front, but extra legnth REALLY made my lower gums sore/bleed!MY SOLUTION!- SOOO I put the regular length brushes- on the bottom, and the ""Extra Reach"" brushes- on the top!LOVE IT NOW!- SOOO fast & clean!"
1,Hydra Brush Poor,"The Hyrra Brush may be a great idea but is most difficult to use. Cumbersome is the best description. Moving from one side of the mouth to the other side, if not done perfectly causes more than the brushes to hit the teeth. OUCH! I also question the validity of the instruction that said somehing like "" use toothpaste if necessary."" What do they mean by that?. I think the reason is, that it is so darn difficult to get toothpaste on the brushes, let alone having it stay on the brushes unless one manages to get the brushes in the mouth before pushing the start button. Yipe! Easy it is not!"
2,They Stand by Their Product,"My faith in standing by ones product has returned.After sending a message to the manufacturer of Hydrabrush letting them know of how my unit died after three months, a company rep sent me an e-mail and called to let me know that they planned to replace the unit. They didn't even want me to send the defective unit back.One of their new models arrived today and I am rather pleased with the replacement. Bravo Hydrabrush!__________________________________________________________________________I bought this item with great hopes.Being basically in a hurry and wanting a better dental check-up, I bought this wonder tool. The cleaning part is great but the unit quit after about three months of twice a day use. The three-phase switch that controls the brush now completely fails to work"
2,"good but not great, better products out there","I purchased this HydraBrush thinking it looked like it could clean better than my SonicCare, it does not. I used my HydraBrush for 4 months, had a dentist check up and the dental assistant said wow you are missing brushing quite a few areas. This was a shock to me because I thought I would have a steller appointment like always, especially since I had this new premium tooth brush. No this tooth brush caused me to miss certain teeth altogether. Also, the toothbrush just totally stopped working after 6 months of use. What a waste of money!"
2,Sonicare is better,"Hydrabrush is below expectations compared to Sonicare which we have been using for years.Following is a list for Hydracare to improve the product:Does not clean teeth and gums as well as Sonicare.Construction is lower than expected for a $100 unit.Power switch seems cheap.Plug in recharge is ancient as all expensive electric toothbrushes have wireless recharge cradle.Brushes are bulky in mouth.Whole concept of long stroke brushing seems less effective vs Sonicare micro-stroke.Suggestions:Upgrade construction quality.Change to micro-stroke brushing.The concept of brushing upper and lower teeth at same time is awesome, but the actual product implementation is below expectations for a $100 toothbrush."
4,Helpful Scroll Saw Information,"This book indeed was written for a person just beginning to work with a scroll saw. The first chapter presents a thorough description of the types of scroll saws available, how they work, and what features are important. Subsequent chapters give the novice a practical description of scroll saw blades, a brief overview of the different types of wood and wood materials available, safety techniques, how to set up a scroll saw, types and sources of patterns, and easy to follow instructions on how to make the various kinds of cuts basic to scroll saws.The author includes come valuable tips, such as how to hone the burr side of a blade and thereby enable much smoother cuts. The abundant use of illustrations (over 275) is very helpful in understanding the technical material being presented. In general, the book relates meaningful information and would be a significant contribution for a reader to gain an understanding of scroll saw fundamentals."
2,Not commercial quality,"I should have been more circumspect about the thickness of the liner. It's very flimsy, and I have to double bag the trash recepticle. I've been used to Costco 45 gallon lawn bags, which are far superior in strength and durability."
3,Music,This was for my wife and she likes it. I have not listened to it myself I have heard other music of thiers and it was goo.
5,Brought back memories!,"I love this cd! It was one of my favorites as a pre-teen and I was glad to have found it. Addictive Love,I can depend on you etc will lift your spirit and draw you closer to God! Love it!"
4,It's all good.,"My husband really wanted this CD. Thank you for making his wish come true. Although it was sent to us scratched, it still plays well enough for us to enjoy. Thanks to Wherehouse for solving this issue, quickly. :-)"
5,hey,"MY ANYLYSIS OF THIS RECORD.

MR.ALEX LIFESON isnt a BECK, CLAPTON, OR PAGE yet.rock hard"
4,Energy In Abundance,"To generate this type of energy after 30 years is amazing. I wish they would have covered ""I'd Love To Change The World "" by Ten Years After. It would have been the perfect ending."
4,Rush sounds tie-dyed and groovy.,"As a longtime fan I was very interested in someday hearing Rush cover other artists songs. I must say I'm really impressed with most of their interpretations on FEEDBACK. Summertime Blues, The Seeker, Mr Soul, and Seven & Seven Is are well done gutsy takes on 60's classics. While Crossroads is probably the weakest song, it is still a really well read attempt at a well worn classic. My only question was, why did Geddy sing it straight? Doesn't he know it's a BLUES SONG?The sound is clear, with the requisite feedback. The musicianship is tight. And, FEEDBACK introduces some of us to the great rock songs our parents rocked to 30+ years ago.Overall, this EP is a great example of why there are still huge numbers of Rush fans.These guys are great."
1,where has all the good sound gone?,I THOUGHT RUSH IN RIO AND VAPORTRAILS WHERE THE WORST MIXED CD'S OF ALL TIME BUT THEN LISTEN TO THIS RELEASE AND THEY WERE NOT AS BAD AS I THOUGHT JUST KIDDING THEY WERE BAD . SERIOUSLY IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY RECORDED THIS ON 8 TRACK TAPE . I WONDER IF THE BAND EVEN LISTENS TO THE FINAL MIX BEFORE RELEASING THERE CD'S ANYMORE? AS A FAN I WILL STILL GO SEE THEM LIVE AND I AM SURE IT WILL BE A GOOD SHOW BUT LATELY THIS BAND CONTINUES TOO DISSAPOINT WITH THERE HALF ASSED RELEASES WITH PISS POOR SOUND AND ANY REVIEWER WHO THINKS THIS IS THE WAY MUSIC SHOULD SOUND AFTER MIXING IT IN THIS DAY AND AGE SHOULD BE SHOT YOU DEAF' DUMB AND BLIND BASTERDS THIS SUCKSSSSSSSSSS.
1,Maybe this is a comedy album,"Hearing Rush destroy Clapton and the Jeff Beck group it makes you appreciate the legends of Rock even more. It confirms what Rush has always been: Second rate, mindless plotz which appeals to nerds and Star Trek geeks who have never been cool enough to enjoy real rock and roll anyway. A message to Rush: Stick with your lame fantasy lyrics and ridiculous chord changes. There are many nerds out there who love it. Please stop insulting real rock and roll with these lame covers. Rush should get back to work on another silly album so all those guys out there will have something to listen to while they play Dungeons and Dragons."
1,Disgraceful,Rush sinks to another new low with this silly cover album. After 30 years of writing songs with the lamest subject matter imaginable the kings of nerd-rock decide to cover some actual good music. Listening to this album one can only come to one conclusion. Rush hasn't learned a thing about what real rock and roll is.
4,Rush - 'Feedback' (Atlantic),"Review no. 212. Until recently, I was never even aware of this Rush EP. Rush gives their longtime loyal followers this eight track EP of '60's rock legend icons who came (and in most cases, were gone) before them. Have to admit it - Rush does a great job on each of these cover songs - as I liked all eight of them the same - from Buffalo Springfield's ""For What It's Worth"" and ""Mr. Soul"" to the Yardbird's ""Heart Full Of Soul"" and the stunning ""Shapes Of Things"". Didn't expect to hear Love's ""Seven And Seven Is"" and The Who classic (one of my all-time Who favorites) ""The Seeker"". Definitely, recommended."
2,disappointing,"Rush was possibly the most influencial band for me in the early 80's. Rush reached its musical apex with Permanent Waves, Moving Pictures and Signals. Grace Under Pressure was acceptable with a couple high points. Then they spiralled into mediocrity and worse. They should have taken the 90's off.With this handful of covers, I guess I was hoping for a return-to-roots sort of sound. Instead it sounds like an uninspired Rush playing a few 60's standards. Ho-hum. No real spirit on any track except for Seven and Seven Is, which rocks. Musically, they sound fine, almost too polished for songs that sound good with a rough garage-band edge. Sorry guys."
5,&#65533;Excelente!,"I never pictured Rush covering these songs. After listening to the album it became an instant favorite. Geddy Lee's vocals molds perfectly to the structure of the songs. And the amount of songs covered in the ""EP"" is the right one! Probably one more song would have been too many. The songs sound fresh in Rush's interpretation and of course you expect a lot from the guitar in these songs; I tell you, you will not be disappointed, Lifeson does an excellent job."
5,RUSH and deePURPLE score!!!,"I just picked up my 'two' favorite bands latest, Rush-Feedback and Deep Purple-Bananas.All I can say is WOW!!! Two great discs, that are simply fun.Don't hesitate to pick up either one.Feedback (8 covers) is 28 minutes and 4 1/2 stars and Bananas (12 originals) is 51 minutes and 5 stars .I'm a proud fan today!"
4,Pretty Darned Good,"All in all the CD is pretty darned good. It seems like they enjoyed making the music and for that it's really worth it. Standout songs: The Seeker, For What It's Worth and an awesome version of Crossroads! Keep up the music and keep making me happy :-)"
4,Just a fun CD,Their style has been stuck in a rut over the last 10 years and this CD is not anything ingenious or original but it is a nice change of pace from what we've heard recently -- probably because they didn't write the songs. For the price you can't go wrong. Use it as a coaster if you don't like it.
4,"Just a fun cd, pick it up",The boys sound as if they're having as much fun recording as they have in a long time. There is actual lead guitar instead of all that layering they did with Vapor Trails. If only they could replicate this vibe in their next studio cd.
3,I rather listen to new songs by RUSH,"hmmm... I love Rush, and I think they are one of the most talented bands in rock today. I realize that these songs mean alot to them and that they enjoyed playing the stuff they used to cover in the early days. For me however, I rather hear a new album by Rush than a cover of songs which I've heard better renditions of by other musicians.@Not much interest in hearing them play ""Summertime Blues,"" but ""The Seeker"" was actually quite good because it really works with their sound. The album art work is nice but this cardboard cover that stays open is a bit annoying. Well, it's time to move on with another Rush album with new material."
3,Not a typical Rush album,"Don't expect your usual full-blown Rush effort here. The band basically recorded covers of some of their favorite songs. The playing is certainly competent and the songs well-done, but this is not a compelling purchase. I love Rush and enjoyed this album, but the songs are basically straight covers. None has been rearranged in any significant way, which is what can really make a cover interesting. That said, if you like Rush you'll probably like this album."
5,Outstanding and Fun,"It's good to see that the POSITIVES here far outweigh the few and putrid negatives from the crybabies who are never happy with anything and complain about everything. That said I'm here to say that this EP is WONDERFUL and it ROCKS the house down!!!Rush are obviously happy to be back and it clearly shows. This is a little gem for the fans as the band are on the road for their 30th anniversary tour, and it is well worth getting. As the positives here have stated all the covers are killer, the guys are clearly having a good time.For me the standouts are the Who songs, ""summertime blues"" and ""the seeker"" and the SMOKIN' closer, Cream's, ""crossroads"" with guitar solos by Alex that would make Eric Clapton proud!!Get this, blast it, have a great time and then go to see them on this tour and continue the party!!!Thank you Rush!"
1,ugh,"This album blows. Rush is my favorite band, and I like the original versions of most of these songs (and subsequent cover versions of some of them...just not Rush's covers). When I heard Rush was putting out a 60's cover album I was truly disappointed. They made it this far without doing anything retarded like that. Well here it is and it's not very good. Soul...maybe that's what it's missing.Go out and buy Hemispheres."
2,"unnecessary renditions, irrelevant recordings","of all the truly original bands, i would have expected rush to be the last to issue such an album. i appreciate the sentiment and intent, but these versions really do little to inspire (other than perhaps the three canucks playing 'em). the mix is dirty, overdriven, and garagey, while their interpretations shed no more light on the old classics than if i'd heard them played at a local dive bar. i just don't get the need for a release like this. vapor trails was bad enough, but then to hear this . . . Thank god we still have their live show and dvds--they can still rip out the old favorites with impressive ferocity and chops."
1,Wont Get Fooled Again,"Wow- finally a Rush album that really sucks. One of the great strengths of my favorite band, has always been the originality and verve of both the pensive lyrics, and the punchy delivery- this album has nothing to offer. Of the whole 60's genre this collection is a miserable representation. I do have to thank them for playing crossroads in concert- I was dying for a piss break. Lets hope the next time The Doctor is feeling sentimental- his mind floats to The Real Me, or Wont Get Fooled Again. Better Yet, how about returning to the classic form that made Rush famous- as for another covers album I Wont Get Fooled Again..."
1,Another lame album of covers - well played though,"Another band releasing an album of covers... yay. Great. Instead of wasting our time with original music, we get to listen to rehashed songs from childhood.At least with Rush you know the playing will be phenomenal (which it is) and the arrangements will be precise (which they are). If you don't already have these songs by their original artists, go ahead and get this album. Otherwise, skip it.And actually, they ARE covering the Who's version of ""Summertime Blues"", but with a little Blue Cheer thrown in. The *ORIGINAL* version of the song was done in the key of E by Eddie Cochran in the late 1950s. The Who transposed it to the key of A, and Rush does it in the key of A as well, and they're doing the faster, harder version popularized by the Who. The intro sounds more like what Blue Cheer did, but BC did the song in the key of C."
1,"Painfully Bad, Embarrassing","This EP is practically unlistenable. Why?1. The production is over-done with far too much high end frequencies2. Rush's weak spot has always been a lack of ""soul"" - a requirement for most of these songs3. Geddy Lee's voice really does not suite anything other than Rush songsI would much rather hear Rush do their own arrangements of cover tunes. Melodramatic, 2112-esque, prog rock satires of classic rock tunes could have been quite entertaining. Unfortunately, Rush just cannot pull off classic rock...at all. I have heard musicians of far less stature and ability do these songs justice.How could Rush have possibly released this? They MUST know how bad it is. I can only guess it was pressure from either their record label or from their fans neither of whom, according to these other reviews, are able to decipher good from horrible music."
1,RUSH CAREER BOOST FAILS,"With their last really good album being 23 years ago(1981's Moving Pictures), a cover album was definitely in the cards to boost their career. However, this AIN'T it. There is no emotion here, and it almost seems like there playing these songs the way they did when they first learned them , circa 1967, as mentioned in the liner notes. Geddy's voice is absolutely only suited for rush originals as demonstrated here. Finally, i think this was a bit overpriced for 8 covers which PALE in comparison to the originals."
5,A LITTLE FEEDBACK NEVER HURT ANYONE ...,"And like the album, a mere 27:11 minutes long, a little is all you get - but with RUSH playing 8 GREAT SONGS from the 60's under a groovy lava lamp trance, SOMEHOW you feel strangely satisfied after its quick end. It does seem almost unforgiveable that something so fun & cool could be so short (with 80 minutes available to really indulge the fans), really downright cruel in fact. Aren't there dozens of perfect possible choices that could have beefed this up? BUT I ACCEPT ... AND I FORGIVE - THIS ROCKS!! Thanks guys, can't wait to hear what you do next ... A NEW DAY IS RISING. Can you feel it?"
4,Good Clean Fun,"This disc shows the roots of Rush. It's not meant to be anything more than a blast from their past, a window in time. It's just a fun disc of covers - good ol' rock and roll. It's a cure for my summertime blues."
3,Throw a guy a bone here,"Well... it's fun. I play music and before I performed original compositions I was - you guessed it - having fun jamming out RUSH cover tunes with my bandmates. So I know the basic fun of ripping out a good cover tune. BUT... It would have been nice to throw in a Rush original, even if a short, quicky instrumental (Rush in the studio not making at least 1 piece of Rush music is just... somehow... *wrong*)."
2,Uninspired inspirations,"Dull covers record does pay a certain homage to classic rock acts by not completely embarrassing some influential material, but still feels generally lobotomized and does nothing special to warrant investment unless you are a Rushaholic."
2,Plain and somewhat dull,"I love Rush, and have since I was a kid. But let me be honest here, this album is dull and is missing the energy that makes the band who they are. They follow the mold (mostly) of each song from its original recording, and never break out and add their own flavor. I feel this effort would be way better if they'd just jam, go off in a tanget, give us something beyond the 60's. If I wanted to hear these songs, I'd go to the orginal artists that made them...I just can't help but think how they should've released an EP with an instrumental or something of the like using their own material. Now that would be something to talk about!"
2,Dissapointing for this Rush fan,"I would have much prefered a release of some early Rush shows where they were actually playing covers like ""Bad Boy"" and ""Not Fade Away"". Fortunately I have some boots of these performances but this could have been a much better present to the fans. Anyone expecting to find the energy of the early years will be dissapointed by such tepid covers as that of Buffalo Springfield. Even the most promising cover, Love's ""7 and 7 is"" is rendered bland in the hands of our favorite Canadian band. Maybe the fans will get better treatment with the 40th anniversary. My advice, avoid this disc and put your money towards catching these guys in concert instead."
5,Nice Change of Pace!,"Rush, in celebration of their 30th Anniversary, decided to cover some songs which inspied them to become the musicians they are today. The result is a nice, light release, which to me, pays enough tribute to the original artists, but does allow Rush to add their own touched to it. I listen to these versions more often than the originals now!"
3,Take it for what it is.,"I have been a Rush fan for umteenth years and have seen them upteenth times!!! Sorry, just wanted to show off my fan status a little in the hope of validating my review. In all seriousness though, I must say a was a little disappointed when I heard that Rush was releasing an EP of cover tunes to commemorate their 30 year anniversary. I just never saw them going down that route. Still, I went and purchased the disc and was nicely surprised. It should be taken for what it is: three great players just jamming out to the tunes that inspired them. It's a fun listen and a lot better than another ""greatest hits"" collection."
3,Held toddlers' attention,"It held my toddlers' attention. It did a good job of presenting the bible stories, and they aren't the ones usually covered so I like that. Unfortunately, the first two stories are the exact same! I was so bummed! About Naaman being healed of leprosy. The third one was new, from about the same time period. Definitely worth the price!"
3,disappointed,"I bought this CD because it has ""What are you doing the rest of your life"" on it. She sang it beautifully sad.But the other songs were not quite live up to the expectations."
3,Pretty good,"I rate this a 3 to 3.5. There are some great songs; Cotton Dress, Apathy, Country Freaks, Hollowed, Shifting, but most of the rest of the tracks left me bored. Still the good songs make this collection worth the used price available here. A slightly more atmospheric Dream Academy, or Hummingbirds. Good male, female vocal interplay, and interesting (never trite) lyrics."
5,Beautiful Beautiful,"What a great album. So unique in its music style and lyrics. I never get tired of it and I play it a lot. It's cool, it's mellow, it's thoughtful... fantastic."
5,Seeing warfare's devastation anew.,"Life does go on, and these photographs capture the beauty and timelessness of a setting so recently ravaged by war. My dream is that the pictures mirror healing of lives as well."
3,strongly dixieland,"this collection of the bobcats is predominantly in the dixieland style. i bought this because i loved all the bob crosby tunes i had been hearing lately. they were mainly swing style, which i love. i don't particularly like dixieland except as an occassional change of pace.if you like dixieland, this would be great for you."
3,Christmas with Soul,"A blues, R&B and jazz-influenced Christmas CD doesn't come along often. Chuck Leavell's Christmas CD has its rough spots, but overall its a good effort and worth the money.The best and worst parts of this CD is Chuck himself. Chuck is an excellent arranger and keyboardist. The jazzy instrumental arrangements of Christmas classics shine - this ain't muzak! You can't help but sit up and take notice.The worst is Chuck the vocalist. He's never been strong vocally (re: Sea Level). He mangles Merry Christmas Baby, and needs fellow Stones-sidemate Lisa Fischer to rescue Please Come Home for Christmas. On the other hand, Chuck delivers on his self-penned Bethlehem, a new Christmas classic. He also hits the mark with Hey Santa. It's a fun song and Chuck has fun singing it.Buy this just to put something different in your Christmas CD collection."
4,Where are the Instructions,"Every time I google ""remington titanium ms 280 (manual, instructions) I get the Amazon site. So where are the instructions. Did everyone who bought one of these come preloaded with instructions built into their genotype? Ah...there ARE no instructions. Who why does Amazon keep coming up."
1,Poor shave quality after 9 months,"I've had this shaver for approximately 9 months. Recently, within the last month, I've noticed it takes much more effort upon my part to get a clean shave from this shaver. The trimmer no longer cuts the coarse hair on my neck and the shaver has difficulty with the stubble on my chin such that I have to go over my chin repeatedly.I've kept the shaver clean and have replaced the foil every two months. Nothing seems to be obviously wrong with it other than the dramatically reduced shave quality."
4,Easy reading and very helpful,This book read very easily. he software comes with a sample DB that the book uses which is great. You may find certain reduncies when working on each chapters examples but its so the reader can jump to any chapter. The book is set up so you dont have to staart from the beginning. It took me a little over a month to finish reading the book simply because the software was at the job. You really need the software to make sense of it.I only wished it delved deeper into table and formulas. But its a beginners book. I recommend it hands down as a starter book
2,It's ok,"It is a beginners book as the title says, but there is a pittfal, the author should consider for future books.Not every chapter has a step-by-step tutrial. The user have to download the samples and use them to be able to follow the author, which defeats the purpose of learning by doing.Chapters 4 & 5 make are mutually exlusive, since chp 5 requires reports from chp 4, that was not a step-by-step tutorial.Either make it a step-by-step or don't. Just be consistent."
4,Nice Pillbox,Very handy.. The only drawback is that you can't attach the timer to pillbox.!!! But good buy for the money
4,A new little friend!,"I purchaed the I-Fish for my 9 year old daughter as a Christmas gift and she absolutely adores it. The little guy is just so cute, and user friendly, that even adults fall in love with it. The color schemes are the hardest thing about it, but after two days my daughter was familiar and now has no problem recognizing I-Fish's moods."
3,Neat,"My 11 year old plays with it from time to time just to have a different way of listening to his music, pretty neat, it reacts to touch . You have to ""feed"" it with music though from time to time for it to operate and if you don't play with it much, battery goes dead. Probably not worth the price"
5,This is one happy fish!,"This is a great product. It lights up, it makes sounds, it dances. It responds to your IPOD, your voice, the piano. It will put a smile on even the grumpiest face. My 8-year old granddaughters each have one, and they are delighted with them. It is probably educational only in that it gives you a chance to explain how sound travels. But the little fish is very entertaining."
5,Funny.,"I ordered this for my ex boyfriend in 2007, and his mom just sent me a photo of it this week, and asked me how she turns it off because it was annoying her. needless to say, it's lasted him the last 6 almost 7 years. =]"
3,J-N I-Fish Review,"The minute I saw one, I wanted one. My sister wanted one. We now both have one and are totally happy with them. To watch it dance and flash it's lights is mesmerizing. I still have bot learned all it can do. When I connected my MP3 player, it sounded good and really reacted to the sound. Ordering was easy and got to me on time."
3,Great phone but no Cingular voice mail,"This phone would be a full 5 stars if all features worked in the US. I've owned various Nokia phones since 1996 and this model is the only one I have come accross that is incompatible to the Cingular voice mail system in the US. Maybe it's just me, but what's the use of a having a triband phone that is network compatible accross 5 world continents including the US but leave out a basic function like voice mail so that it can only be used in a specific region like Asia? I want mandatory drug testing on all Nokia 6233 design engineers."
5,A favorite that will be passed on to future generations.,"I was given this book as a child. It is still one of my favorites that I own. I bought a new Eloise for my older daughter, who passed it onto her little sister. This is a story of a little girl, Eloise, who lives at the Plaza Hotel with her nanny. She has a very vivid imagnation and is quite an actress. Her adventures in a single day can leave the reader with panges of envy. If only I could do what she does and get away with it. Her nanny fits into the role of a ""I missed the boat"" of becoming a Mary Poppins graduate. Still you have to love her because you know she really loves Eloise. Sit back and enjoy the ride,the elevator ride of course. It will keep you busy for a good 20 minutes. This book will be read more than once. I guarantee it....."
5,An endearing look at a charming--if exasperating--7 year old,"""Eloise"", and all her subsequent stories, is Kay Thompson's simple look at this wonderfully funny, precocious, loveable, innocent 7-year-old city girl. Her antics throughout Park Plaza, where she lives with her ""Nanny"", her pug-nosed dog, a turtle and an assortment of ledge-dwelling pidgeons, will tickle your soul! Eloise's attempts at sophistication, as the daughter of world-traveling parents, and her assortment of childhood pranks, will undoubtedly take you back to your own childhood. I have read this book, and the others, dozens of times since I was a child in the 60's! Though it was evidently originally written for children, I have no doubt that it's biggest audience is adults"
5,I rawther love love love this book!,"As we all know, Eloise is six and she lives at the Plaza Hotel with her Nanny who says things three times, her dog Weenie, her turtle Skipperdee and two dolls. When I was a child, I adored this book and wanted to be just like Eloise. She does whatever she wants and gets away with it.As an adult, I feel so sorry for Eloise because her mother only sends for her when it's sunny and otherwise isn't present. What a poor little girl to grow up so alone!However, this is a tremendously humorous and beautifully illustrated classic that can always make me grin from ear to ear. I looooovve room service too! Oh, and charge it please. Thank you very much."
2,Came with a torn page,Great Classic book but damaaged.Book was in good condition except there was a torn page. Too bad because it was a gift.
5,one of the best stories for children or adults!,"I used ""Eloise"" as my forensics piece last year and had a ball with it. She is one of the most interesting characters in literature. She never tires, never gets depressed, and always has a witty comeback for everyone. Her antics are priceless, and the motives behind them are heart-wrenching. She can't stop talking, because she is afraid if she does, that people won't pay any attention to her. That is my view, and I think the lack of punctuation in the story supports it. Her fantastic tales captivate readers and listeners alike. I adore Eloise, Weenie, and Skipperdee, and will do so into my old age, I am sure."
3,Disappointed,"After reading the other reviews I was excited to buy this book for my 6-year-old daughter. Eloise is spoiled and rude and lives a life that most kids I know would not understand. There are humorous parts and my daughter seems to like it, but it's not as good as I thought it would be. Maybe because I'd never read it as a child? Oh -- it's also very long. Too long for many kids this age."
1,What am I missing?,"I recommended my sister get this book for my daughter off Amazon. It arrived for Christmas, I started reading and put them to bed before I finished it. I don't think it is appropiate at all for this age range. It's outdated and Eloise is a pain in the keister. I do not recommend this at all for children under 8. Of course, my 6 and 4 year old daughters loved it. Go figure."
1,Not a keeper!!!,"Bought them, read them to my kids, returned them. Don't let the reviews fool you. Definitely not a keeper. Much better children's literature out there."
5,Eloise is a great read!,"I picked this book on this very website 6 months ago and boy was I impressed. You see, Eloise is impish 6-year old in who lives in the Plaza Hotel (This actually exists) that does things like bothering hotel guests and pouring water down the mail chute. Her twisted philosophy on things are also pretty neat to read. One of my favorite parts is when Eloise annoys the living heck out of her teacher by repeating every word he utters out.As a 18-year old, I loved this book from front to end. They don't say ""A book for precocsis grown-ups"" for nothing. Eloise may not appear that ""perfect"" (I don't mind that gut of hers, makes her unique!), but her personality does!"
1,Didn't realize this was a Spanish version,I know it says it in the title. I am an idiot and didn't realize it. I wish it hadn't been the top 5 returns for my search of Eloise. The English version of this hardcover book couldn't be found in the listing until a few pages in. I didn't even realize I had bought the Spanish version until i received my follow up email & now it's too late to return it and I have to buy a new one. Ugh.
5,ELOISE IS THE BOMB!!!,"Eloise is so funny,she is a free spirt, and very accurate. She's here, She's there, She's everywhere. Recently, they made Eloise at the Plaza,(Rated 5 stars) And she's great.Though I'm 10, and the age group is 6 and over, I LOVE IT. I have that and Eloise in Paris, and Eloise in Moscow (First Prinitng)If you read this, you'll always be glad you did..."
3,kids love her,"I recently taught a workshop with this Eloise book as the theme. I think that the book was entertaining to my group of 6-8 year old children. I think that the appeal to the kids is the pure fun of being bad and getting a way with it, because every child has a mischevious side. As an adult, i found Eloise to be a little annoying, but the book was written for children, so really their opinions count a little more. I think that it is an entertaining book for both the parent and the child, and some references the kids will not pick up on, like ""My mother knows Coco Chanel,"" but the parents will find amusing. Overall, I would recommend this book for a little bit older child, probably 7-8, not 4-6."
1,POOR ELOISE!!,"My son was very disturbed about where the parents were. She wanted to know if the parents were mean and why they didn't love their own daughter. Yikes. I had never read Eloise before, but had heard it was cute. I guess it had its moments, but I do feel sorry for Eloise."
2,not what I want my child to emulate.,interesting to read as an adult. Wouldn't want to read to a young child.
5,Rawther delightful!!!,"Eloise is everything I've always wanted to be but never was. I had friends who were daring like her, so I lived vicariously through them and Eloise. I absolutely adore her. My online friend calls me Skipperdee and she couldn't remember where the name came from. I told her it was from Eloise and she said, Huh?. Needless to say I bought both books for her and she loves them!! Now I call her Weenie!! :)"
1,Read it before you buy it...,I love Curious George. I love Madeline. I'm fond of spunky little girls and protagonists who get into trouble. But I hate this book and pity/dislike its main character. She's essentially been abandoned by her parents and spends most of her time making a nuisance of herself in an attempt to get some attention. She's inconsiderate and not particularly imaginative. There's no charm in her adventures. (Example: whenever she gets into a crowded elevator she pretends she's dropped her skate key on the floor.) And the prose is affected rather than literary.I'm not saying you won't like the book -- I know lots of people who do. But this is definitely not a case where you should trust glowing reviews. See for yourself.
1,Cheap materials,This product is too fragile to seriously use. The product description is misleading because most parts of the reel are plastic and the rod itself is a little too stiff. My rod BROKE IN HALF with hardly any real weight on the end of the line. This product was a disappointment.
2,"Small yes, serious about fishing no.","Blue World Smallest Mini Fishing Fish Rod Pen Reel PoleThis is ok for a joke,but not for serious fishing. Save up a little more money and get a real rod & reel set up."
4,Mercury Outboard Shop Manual,"Once again, another fine product from Clymer's. I have only had this manual for about a week now, but have found the information to be accurate and very well detailed. The wire schematic section was great! Colored wires would have been better but it was easy to follow. If you have an outboard motor, you will need this valuable manual."
4,Will help get most jobs done...,"This manual will help you get most jobs done on your motor, though it is not as detailed as a full factory repair manual. The price is much lower than a factory manual too. Overall this will be sufficient to get a mechanical person through most tasks that you'll need to accomplish."
2,"Not ""extreme"" enough","This is a short sampler rather than a full album, and the samples included don't offer much. The ""Too Fat Polka"" and the two Brave Combo tracks are more traditional than ""extreme."" The tracks by Big Lou the Accordion Princess and Polkacide have some zing. Only the Polkaholics' ""Polka on Guitar"" justifies the ""extreme"" label. For listeners looking for crossover appeal, that's not enough. For polka fans, there's not enough, period."
1,FLASH GORDON ISN'T IN COLOR!,AMAZON advertises that this movie is in BLACK & WHITE as well as COLOR. I purchased it on 02/13/2009 and returned it the same day. It is in FUZZY BLACK & WHITE O N L Y! It DOES come in a display tin [which is in color!]. I think that where they got the idea that it is COLORIZED! Perhaps someone at AMAZON should physically check out the movies that they advertise rather than take the word of new suppliers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,A Handsome Bible,"This particular Bible is made with the nicest materials, and is very handsome in black. The pages are gilded with gold. It's not really a true giant print, though. The font size is about 10.5 or 11 point size. Giant size should start at 12 point font size. Still, this is a very readable Bible, and should last a very long time as an heirloom as well."
2,"NOT GIANT PRINT, NOT LEATHER, NOT REALLY COMPACT","As previous reviewers have pointed out, this Bible is NOT a giant print version. I would categorize the print as moderately large with excessive show-through on tissue-like paper and very narrow margins. The binding is glossy, bonded leather NOT genuine and the pages are not sewn. The format is fully an inch too large to be considered compact and I would have preferred a smaller, thicker Bible. Also there is a good chance that this Bible was printed and or bound in communist China as Thomas Nelson now lists Beijing as one center of operations. I am sure glad I did not pay full price for this Bible, it is worth about $10."
2,Binding Upside Down,All OK except it makes you look like you can't read because the binding has been attached upside down. When reading from this bible the cover will display the words 'Holy Bible' upside down.
5,fast service,It was just what I ordered. The time factor from order to received was very fast. Knowing the type of material on the cover would have been helpful but I was satisfied with the product.
3,save your money..buy the individual cd's,In MOST cases...buying a BOX SET is a great deal.....NOT in this case....you'd be further ahead to buy the individual British import cd's on amazon and also the 2 past masters...and have money left over....if you REALLY want the rare stuff....invest in the 3 anthology 2cd sets and the BBC set...and the LET IT BE NAKED....you'll pretty much have it all...I have been a Beatles collector and fan since 1963...and this is what I did.
3,Adding a bit of clarity,"The only Beatles songs I couldn't find in this box were the instrumental pieces only avalible in American (not UK) albums, but those were not really Beatles, they were George Martin. Are those worth so much to complain about? Maybe you should find a compilation of just George Martin instrumentals.I'm not sure about what bearboya said, but I counted 129 songs in here. None of them are repeated. The first 14 discs are the British albums (the American versions have more George Martin and less Beatles), and the last two discs are all the singles not included in the albums. Where are the repeated ones?The other albums you've heard about (like Red and Blue) are anthologies, so you won't need them when you have all this.But on top of all that, I totally agree with skooterfd and Dave Gruska. You would save $73.14 if you bought all 16 CDs from Amazon.com separately, and the plastic box can't be worth that much. There's free shipping too."
1,RIP OFF! There is another option.,"If you want to have fun and get the best sound, this is what I would do. Get the Capitol Albums Vol 1. (first 4 American albums) Which replace the English albums: With The Beatles, A Hard Days Night, and Beatles For Sale. Reason is the American albums sound better. Trust me I have all the American Beatle albums and all the English CD's and had no idea the songs were recorded differently till I seen an article about it. HELP was the first English stereo album. All the other English albums before HELP were in Mono. Then buy these English Beatle CD's. Please Please Me, HELP, Rubber Soul, Revolver, Magical Mystery Tour, White Album, Yellow Submarine(songtrack)Abbey Road, Let It Be. Include Past Masters VOL 1 & 2 and Beatles 1 for all the singles. Cost $200 TOPS!!"
3,A great idea with poor timing.,"This is bizarre. Why would this boxed set be released BEFORE these albums are remastered?Two stars are missing because of the poor timing. Two stars are added because it's The Beatles.A future collector's item. Nothing more, nothing less."
4,Very good collection,"I would have preferred more of the earlier songs, but it's solid Beatles!The storage wood box is not of high quality. When I first opened it, it fell apart in my hands, and we had to glue it together before we could present it as a gift. It suffices now. And...it's what's inside that really counts!"
4,Beatles Box Set,Delivered on time in good shape at fair price. CD's all ok. Would have given 5 stars but the collector's box is a little funky because they glued it so it would accept the double disc white album.
1,Be careful what you pay for,It's difficult to rate an item when it is sold to you in a substandard condition. Do not buy directly from amazon or their associate warehouse_deals as they sell boxed sets without boxes and then tell you that you are stuck with it since they cannot guarantee they will get more in. So be sure to shop elsewhere.
2,Wait!,"Don't buy the 1987 stereo mixes of their albums because they suck. Hold on until EMI releases the remastered Mono versions of their first albums, up to Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. They're on their way."
1,THIS IS JUNK!!!,"It's not the Beatles I'm referring to when I call this JUNK! They're supreme as is their catalog. IT'S THE DAMNED BOX which, as it did for some other reviewers, fell apart right out of the shipping carton! How can AMAZON, in good faith, knowing others have had heartburn with this, still send out this trash and charge what they do??? They KNOW they are selling us garbage!I had to spend 6 hours trying to glue this back together, first one panel, then another. I can't send it back because it's a Christmas present, and there's no time to return it and get a replacement. Now that they've eliminated super-saver free shipping, I'm not even sure I'll buy from Amazon again.BUY THE BEATLES, by all means. JUST DON'T BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK!!!"
3,Tricky Model #,I didn't pay attention to the minor Model # difference but is MAJOR difference. I wanted the magnet head but didn't realize there was another one with insert/twist/click to get it in/out of position. The Magnet head would have been much better.
4,Nice Faucet,"We're happy with the product and would purchase it again. The item shipped very quickly.One note is that this model does not have the magnetic connection on the hose like the ones that are currently out in the big box stores now. You have to twist it to lock into place. It still works fine and was a $60 savings, so I think it was worth it. It is a large faucet and requires a deep sink and it does swing easily, so you need to go easy moving it so you don't end up with water everywhere."
5,Not a Jazz fan?`,"Me, neither. But one of my friends had this cd, and I thought I'd pop it in because my name is the title of track 2. I got hooked. Jazz isn't my favorite, but this CD is awesome. Saxophones are incredible by themselves, but Dave Koz is invincible. Definitely a first rate buy. Go for it!"
5,We REALLY need...,a proper legal reissue of CLOTHOS WEB-maybe with a fold out miniLP cover.Possibly the best of her work-except for maybe LIGHTNING.
4,Lighting Book Review,I thought this book gave a great overview of both the physics of light and the principles of good lighting design.
4,Very good book!,"This is a great lighting design book, lots of graphical explanations, lots of useful information, a must-buy for any kind of interior designer!"
3,"Deeply flawed, but also inspiring","Yes, Murray can be an idiot, and yes he can be offensive and yes he can seemingly just turn his ears (and mind) off sometimes.One the whole, though, this book is obviously a product of love rather than hate. The photos of artists, venues and record labels, and the writing about the great music he loves I find to be inspiring and enlightening.Murray is very good at listening with the context of the artist in mind, and he does a good job of discrediting some of the abstract artistic standards some critics have applied to what was in many ways an African American folk expression.He definitely helped me come to a better and different understanding of Louis Armstrong as an artist and as a man. For this I can thank him, though there is plenty else in the book that I'll just pack away in my mental collection of Murray-isms.But there are things to be gained from this book if you don't let it get you too angry."
1,Outrageous vision of racial purity in the arts,"Murray's ideas that White people cannot produce genuine jazz have done a great deal of harm in their influence. The racist comments, particularly re Bix Beiderbecke and the photograph from ""Great Day In Harlem"" are absolutely outrageous."
4,Truth Be Told......,"I purchased this cd because of the cover art. Mr Verner's ambient compositions are nothing special but they will not dissappoint. Mellow music for a soft Autumn's afternoon. Sit back, relax, reflect....The title track is especially mesmerizing...only wish it were a little more developed & longer in length. 4 stars...a B+.....a .285 hitter!"
5,Fun for the Family,"This is fun, predictable but fun. Your kids will love seeing the kid who just can't measure up finally take the prize - don't worry I can't spoil it we already know how it's going to turn out and it's all just a feel good kind of movie where everybody wins in the end - even the bad guy. Nothing objectionable."
5,Good DVD trivia game product,"If you are looking for a simple trivia DVD game product, this is a good value. 1,400 questions on sports, music, and movies."
1,Ultimate Entertainment Challenge 3,This is not what I expected for a DVD. It is very very simple. I could have made a better on myself on my own DVD from home.The company I bought it from was ok and sent it on time and their service was good. The DVD is just crummy.
4,Great Value,"I learned to love Demerara sugar while living in the U.K. in the 90's. but couldn't always find it here in the States. These days it's generally available, but it's expensive. However, The Billington's is real Demerara at half the price of the supermarket. Great tasting in the morning coffe or tea.The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is that it has a slightly higher moisture content than other brands, causing it to form a brick in the cellophane inside packaging. You can't really store it in the original package after opening. However, a little gentle ""massaging"" of sugar in the inside package before opening will return it to a nicely granulated state, which can then be stored in a sugar bowl or other container (I use one of those clear lucite airtight jars).Highly recommended."
4,Good,"Good flavor, good quality, but seems to be somewhat overpriced. Other than that, I have no complaints about the product."
2,Trouble ahead,"The trouble with this kind of data book is that it's already dated one minute before it's published. This book covers up until 2002 and, as you know, were already at 2007...Also, in the Internet age all thsi data can easily be obtained in a lot of web sites. Of course, this kind of book has the advantage of displaying the data in a friendly manner and within only one tome.Well, anyway, make up your own mind..."
1,expected better,"I expected better after hearing how good she is, but the technical and emotional sides are lacking, the sound/tone is weak, and the programming could be better."
3,ok but not great,I would not recommend this one for anyone over 6 ft tall I would recommend for a teenager is ok but not great
2,disappointed,"I researched different slant boards and looked for one that had adjustable incline and even though this product is advertised as adjustable, it is not. That is the only reason for low rating. This was a disappointment. The only part that is adjustable is the leg support. On the positive side, it appears to be very sturdy, assembled easily, and worth the expense if you don't mind that the incline can not be adjusted."
3,it's okay,it's alright except the seat pads were really uncomfortable to the point where i wouldn't even want to use it. it was narrow and it felt a little unstable.
3,Ok,for a 6ft person not so great. its really uncomfortable for how your legs are place. you should try one before you buy one.
3,Does the job but no so comfortable,"Okay, if you're skinny you will have no problem with this product, but if you are not a very skinny person, it can be kind of uncomfortable at the knees and legs. I quit using it because every time I workout with it my legs would hurt. Gave it away."
1,Poorly constructed ans designed piece of equipment,"The bench has two problems: the ergonomics are poor and cause strain on your lower back as you go down. Second, the foam pads designed to support the back of your knees and hold at your ankles are too short, and the pads do not provide enough cushion. I am about 190 lbs, and 6' tall, and this bench hurts the back of my knees are strain my lower back. The bench is also not adjustable, so even if the ergonomics fit your body, you are stuck with one inclined position. I don't recommend this to anyone."
1,Good for the under-5-foot-tall set,"If you are taller than 5-foot-2, this sit-up board is not for you. If it doesn't break your legs, it'll shut off circulation to them and to your feet, and you'll hang over the end. When I tried it, I couldn't pay much attention to my abs because my lower legs were in such misery. On the plus side, it would be ideal for waterboarding midgets."
3,look for other ones to buy,So i bought this for my boyfriend. He had fun putting this together. instructions could be better. once it was up and ready he went to use it and the back of his legs hurt fom the seat pad. I think its not padded enough. It hurts him everytime hes on it. I wanna send it back but he wants it.
1,creates chafing and lower back pain,"I've used many incline boards and this thing sucks. Did 4 sets with a plate on my chest. I got the worst upper butt chafing from this thing, I couldn't even shower it hurt so bad. The upper knee rests go too high and they can't adjust either, you feel lower back stress when you descend to the very bottom. Hate this thing, never had any problem with other incline boards."
3,Easy assembly not so easy storage,"Product is fair, quick assembly and use. Misrepresentation... does NOT fold as advertised, has to be taken apart."
3,Does not fold,"Got my product today. Assembly was simple and easy, done in a few minutes. However I was disappointed to see that I could not fold it like I thought I would be able to. Other than that I am happy with it."
4,A good basic board at a good price,"Long enough and sturdy enough for my 6'1"" 205 lb. frame. Easy to assemble. Does not fold. I'll be using it for situps, mainly, and the frame and backpad look well built enough for many years service.The only Con is the skimpy pads on the behind-the-knee pegs. They hurt the first time I used the board. Threw a double folded towel over them for the next session and that solved the problem. These pads will most likely be the first thing that wears out on this board. I'm going to look into buying a spare set."
3,Very Good Could be Better,"I have read reviews about users complainig of missing parts. Well, you would think that by now the manufacturer would have gotten the message, no, that have not, as there are still missing washers. The board is attached to the stand by just ONE bolt, when it should have two, which causes it to rattle when moved. All just to save on one bolt...The padding could be better, as I do not think it will last too long. Other than that fair Chinesse board for the money."
3,I Made it Work,"I needed a workout bench for situps/crunches that was portable/foldable. While this was the right price it was not conveniently portable in the usual sense. I bought another (longer) bolt, washer and wing nut. Works great! Pretty easy on, pretty easy off. Breaks down in two pieces, in a few seconds, but that's an acceptable compromise. Don't know why the manufacturer can't put a cotter pin, a hing to do the same thing. Oh well.As it is, it was easy to set up, everything provided except a "" adjustable wrench."
4,If only it adjusted!!,It does exactly what you see. I wish I could adjust it as its a pretty steep incline for just starting out. Would be 5 stars if it could be adjusted.
2,defective,Foam board screw holes did not match up to the main frame that would attach to it. All of the holes were about an inch off so it could not be attached. Returned product and will purchase a different product. Looks like they may be in the process of changing the frame to make it more stable (i.e. with wider metal bars on the main frame) but the bolt holes on the foam pad weren't cut to the same width.
2,Not designed well.,"I had to run a tap though most of the treaded holes. I had to drill out the hole to put it together. If you do not have a metric tap set and drill don't buy this item. It does not fold awayor even go together as is. So be warned. Now that I have redrilled holes and re tapped threads It will work fine, Hense the 3 stars. however, putting it together was a nightmare!"
5,Just what you need!,"Since I am a very busy person, sometimes I don't have the time to go to the gym as I would like to. I was looking for an abdominal board to work my abs at home. This is perfect because it is compact and efficient. You can easily fold and store it anywhere. It works your abs properly and does the job that it is designed to do.In addition, ""the price is right!"""
1,Apex JD- 1.2 Slant Board,The Item was listed as a folding slant board. I tried ( 2 ) different one's . I have had to return both. The item is not as advertised.
1,cant wait to get,"I am currently working in Afghanistan we have a gym we made up here and the only thing that would be nice is a slant board, this will be perfect for a decline bench press that will fit perfectly under the bar on the squat rack. Also be helpful to get our abs a better work out. Thank you for all the reviews it helped my choosing."
3,"Good value, but does not fold as advertised",Pros:Good quality.Easy to assemble.Nice colors.Cons:Does NOT fold contrary to what is stated in Amazon's product description.No quick changing of inclination level.
3,Decent for the $$$,"Not to bad considering the cost. It's a little on the small side (I'm 6'1"") and I barely fit. It does the trick though. If you're a wide person, you might want to look else where as the back board is very narrow. It does support my 215lb frame though. I'll give it 3.5 stars."
4,Happy,"My son wanted this ordered, He is happy with it.Put together well, and very easy.Shipping and over all pricing was all very good for this product."
2,Not as advertised,"The product I received has a fixed incline, it is not adjustable. Assembly wasn't bad, the holes didn't quite line up and required a little persuasion (hammer) to get together. It will serve the purpose, but it would have been nice if it was adjustable as pictured."
1,Fitness item purchase from Amazon.com LLC,"Should have shown more detailed description for the item because the description provided wasn't enough. I was looking for a board that raised way higher than this (at least a four foot incline), this one doesn't raise high enough (it a two foot incline, which is ineffective for what I was looking for). Obviously, that is manufacture related. But the description provided on how high the board incline is insufficient and poorly detailed which becomes Amazon.com LLC problem. I find purchasing any fitness equipment from Amazon.com LLC to be inconvenient due to lack of item description."
2,Different product received.,Slant board received has not an adjustable slant position as advertised. Still a good fitness equipment and will make use of it.
1,overpriced,"Got this same watch (different color band) from ShopNBC for $84. It was a nice style but very, very thick and uncomrtable to have on...plus the strap was so thick that I couldn't get it to close properly... I had to return it because it was essentially unwearable."
4,"works great, great price, but clunky","This works flawlessly for me. However, the reader itself is a little clunky and has no cover over the card, so you can't *really* use this as a substitute for a thumb drive the way you can with the little IOGear reader."
4,"card is fine, but oh god the packaging","Card works fine in the camera, it is a bit slow but that's my own fault for not getting a high speed card. haven't used the reader yet but it seemed like a nice plus to have. the main problem with it so far is that opening the package took half an hour and I wound up with lacerations. should come with power tools or something to open it. Once you get it out, though, it's fine."
1,cheep card reader,Worked for about 3 weeks and quit. Too low priced to bother returning. Hit the trash can.
4,Very helpful,My 3 yr old son really enjoys this book. At the time we purchased this he was afraid of loud noises. This book has helped to ease his fears. The book is well written and the characters are cute. I would recommend this to anyone.
3,Should have been 100 pages.,"An interesting analysis of our culture. But Sorokin's paradigm of three steps to cultural disintegration (idealistic, ideational, sensate) is applied too broadly. At times it felt like Brown was fitting the square peg of this theory into every round hole that could be found. The examples started to get laborious to read through, with Brown spending too much time presenting data that fit the three step paradigm and not enough time analyzing things more broadly. If Brown would have condensed this thing to 100 pages or less, it would have still served it's purpose of alerting us to the progression history has seen in previous eras. At 250+ pages it should have moved well beyond the simple three-step theory."
4,A Great Western,"Zane Grey is often overlooked but he is truly a great western writer. Grey speaks in a voice that is down to earth, honest and simplistic. He gives us true insight into the mind of country people from long ago. People were good and love was pure. This is a fish-out-of water story about a wild city slicker girl that is forced to come to the country to stay with her sister. A country boy falls in love with her and tries to win her over. A great old fashioned story."
5,so proud,"This book is by my grandfather, and he would be astonished to learn how much one copy costs now! I have wonderful memories of camping with Grandma and Grandpa Karr in the Sierras and in Mexico with old number 58 (their airstream). We had the coach here on our farm up until a few years ago, when we finally sold it. There is actually a photo of me with my family in the book. I'd love a copy, but cannot spend 80 bucks for it!After all these years it is still a good read, and actually quite timely, as more and more of us boomers look at retiring. Who wants to go directly to the rocker on the front porch? I too want adventure, and Harrison and Shirley Karr had some doozies!"
1,Rotten at the core,"It is important to know that the authors of this piece have been thoroughly discredited. Richard Cohen was ejected from The American Counseling Association in 2003 for ethics violations. Supposedly ex-gay Michael Johnston was reported to have been hosting gay orgies and having unprotected sex without disclosing his HIV+ status at the same time he was promoting this ex-gay propaganda. When a work such as this stems from such disreputable sources, the result cannot be anything but rotten."
3,"The first single out of ""People Like Us"" - 3.5 Stars","In realtà il voto sarebbe 3.5, ma forse è pechè non ho gradito particolarmente la scelta operata dai ragazzi e dalla produzione di scegliere proprio questo brano come primo singolo. Decisamente migliore la scelta del secondo estratto dalla loro ultima fatica ""Dysfunctional Professional"".La canzone guadagna mordente dal vivo, ma da questa versione studio non sono riuscito a farmi convincere al 100%."
1,Rust in the discount rack,"It doesn't surprise me that (so many) used copies are availablefor sale.Sure, its some of the best technical metal guitar you'llhear anywhere, no one will disagree with that. The problemis that its boring. Just boring. To good to a fault,it doesn't move you, it doesn't take you anywhere, exceptto sleep. They forgot their emotions when they went tothe studio, and metal is built on emotion and a kick buttrhythm section, not technical guitar skill.Couple that with the fact that the lyrics are, for themost part, pretty lame, and you end up with a real lemon.Guitar virtuoso wanabes will want this, everyone elseshould move on.Now, to queue up behind (the) others to unload my copy ..."
1,sucks! get good charlot,"this album was terrible, me and my freinds listened to it and it was the worst piece of thrash ever! me and my freinds needed to listen to some good music to skateboard too so we put in some good charlot and it was all better. good charlot is a lot heavier and intense. good charlot would blow megadeth off the stage!"
1,The Worst Album I've Ever Heard!,I don't get what the craze all over the 'net is with this album. I bought it and sold it the next day. The only song worth listening to is Dawn Patrol. I read on virtually every Megadeth page about how this is their greatest album. This completely untrue in my opinion. Don't get me wrong--I love metal but this was just stupid. I do not recommend this CD at all--if you want vintage Megadeth check out Countdown to Extinction.
1,New fans beware! Buy the original R.I.P.,"I know this has been said in previous reviews, but I must pile on and reiterate, DO NOT BUY THIS REMASTERED VERSION. Some of the vocal tracks have been re-recorded and sound like absolute garbage compared to the original mix. Buy the original Rust in Peace mix that came out on Capitol Records, it has the superior sound. I can't believe Mustaine did this to this album!!!"
4,STUNNING HABILITY,"MEGADETH displayed a musical virtuosity never reached before or after in their albuns. This RUST is astonishingly perfect, musically speaking. Thue guitar are flying everywhere, delivering fantastic metal. I'm sorry, but Metallica was never capable of playing with this vitality and virtuosity ( you can't compare Kirk Hammett with Marty Firedman, after all ....)"
2,Buy the original print,Dave mustaine stole the soul of this album when he resang so many of the songs. The album was perfect to begin with it didn't need to be touched. When he resang five magicks he ruined a great song. When the deeper voice comes in it sounds like a happy retard. Buy the orginal print used and you will see that the album was perfect to begin with.
2,Terrible,"The original 1990 version of Rust In Peace was a true masterpiece in thrash metal. Perfect compositions, killer lyrics, and tight, and dynamic production that jumped out of the speakers. This 2004 version however is absolutely terrible. The replaced vocal tracks sound awful, and the new remixing/remastering makes the album sound plastic, bloated, and the fact that the audio is a victim of the Loudness War causes unnecessary clipping and distortion in places where it shouldn't be.If you're a true Megadeth fan, this version is worth getting just for the bonus tracks, but I highly recommend you look for the original 1990 version which can be found in used record stores, or even Amazon. It's truly disappointing that this version is the standard when it comes to broadcasting the songs through airplay on hard rock/metal stations, etc. The original should be re-issued/re-released, or whatever so that a fine recording isn't forgotten."
2,A bit pointless,"I own the original (which I love) and listened to a couple of my favourite songs on the remixed edition and all I have to say is... THOSE NEW VOCALS ON ""TAKE NO PRISONNERS"" AND THE TITLE-TRACK JUST SLAP ME IN THE BACK OF MY HEAD! I hope Dave didn't dare to re-record parts on the demos.The mix however is probably the only one apart from KIMB that wasn't ruined but the original was perfect.The extra star is for ""My Creation"" which is lovely."
5,Symphony of Destruction,"Well I know the title for this review is a song from another album but whatever. Anyway this cd really rocks. It took me a while to accept Megadeth because of Dave Mustaine's voice. But for any metal fan this is a cd that must be added to your collection. The riffs, solos, and etc. are just ungodly. Dave's voice isn't that bad after you get use to it."
5,AMAZING!,The best way to desribe this album is that it is an outstanding metal symphany! A must-have cd for anyone who likes awesome music
5,Rust in Peace,This is one of the best albums ever made I heard Peace sells a long time a go and said this a a very good band. Then I heard Holy wars the punishment due and said this is a very good song. So I went out and bought this albulm listened to it without skipping any of the songs This is Megadeths best albulm. Also Check out peace sells but whos buying it is a very good albulm.
5,A Metal Classic,"Great songs on here, great music all in all. ""Lucretia"" in my opinion is the standout here- while not nearly as heavy as ""Take No Prisoners"" or ""Holy Wars"" it has a unique groove all its own that no other band in the world could imitate, with its beautiful riffs and wonderful solo at the end thanks to Marty Friedman (lead guitarist at the time)If you're a metal fan or new to Megadeth this is a must have in your collection!"
5,Rad,"I've heard 6 of Megadeth's albums and this is definetely the best. All the songs on this album are excellent, there are no bad ones to speak of. The guitar work is great and extremely fast (Mustaine and Friedman must be two of the best guitarists there are) and it is melodic at times yet still very heavy. For anybody just getting into these guys I'd recommend either this, ""Youthanasia"" or ""Countdown To Extinction"", all three are awesome. Stand out songs are definetely ""Holy Wars... The Punishment Due"", ""Tornado Of Souls"" and ""Rust In Peace... Polaris"". If you have heard any of Megadeth and like it, then definetely pick this one up, it's easily one of the best albums I own."
3,Something is different.,"Let me begin by saying everyone should own the original.Now on to the remaster. The sleeve looks great, pics are great. The instruments shine like they never have. There are so many bass lines on that album that I have never heard before. So many little fills that shows how good of a bassist David is. Nicks drumming is great he does a few things that I had never noticed. Now on to the disturbing part. THE ONLY ORIGINAL VOCAL TRACKS ARE HOLY WARS AND HANGER 18. Please people, listen closely to the album and if you know the original album like the back of your hand you will come to this realization. I don't know what had happened in the process of this remaster. But Dave certainly did ruin TNP, 5 magics. The others sound ok for being redone. If you are looking for a better remaster of the old MD. Pick up Peace Sells or So Far....... they sound awesome to say the least."
1,TRUE STORY...,"... i walked into record store one day and decided to look in the megadeth bin for fun, and i almost laughed when i saw all of the ""used"" copys of the megadeth remastered albums. what was the point of dave doing this? the original cds were just fine,now they have been screwed around w/ and the vocals arn't original anymore. now it will be hard to find the originals now that these abomination remasters are out. oh well, thanxs alot dave, at least scott ian wouldn't be doing this to his fans"
5,The best ever made metal Ablum !,"Megadeth reached the very top with Rust In Peace mixing with great talent all of technical high level music, heavy and speed metal thunder, melodic parts, complex and various structures !Every true metal (and music) lover have got to buy and make buy this killer album !RIP is definately the best ever made metal album !"
5,Megadeth at their best,"Rust In Peace is Megadeth's best album. This was the best lineup of Megadeth as they sound reborn here after the uneven So Far, So Good, So What. ""Holy Wars"", ""Hangar 18"", and ""Lucretia"" are among the best tracks they've ever done. ""Hangar 18"" indeed may be one of the most powerful tracks in metal, particularly the outro when Dave Mustaine and Marty Friedman trade wicked lightning fast solos during the closing jackhammer riff. The rhythm section of David Ellefson and Nick Menza are fantastic here, particularly on tracks such as ""Five Magics"" and ""Poison Was The Cure."" They would breakthrough to the masses on Countdown to Extinction, but that album isn't as consistent or heavy as this one. A thrash metal classic. This and the Peace Sells album are definitely their best."
5,MegaSHRED!,"This is just awesome! Dave & Marty's skillful fast guitar shredding makes this album one of my favorites. The best songs are the title song, ""Hangar 18,"" & ""Five Magics,"" but they're all very good except for ""Dawn Patrol"" (which is slow & boring.) If you like technical hard rock, you will probably love this album."
5,Their Best to Date !,"Megadeth at their best. This is the one that made me a Megadeth fan. Pure Energy and Pure Aggression. Every song kicks here at full speed ahead. Every time I put this one on its blasting. Favs include the now classics ""Holy Wars"", ""Hanger 18"" and ""Tornado Of Souls"". A Must get for any metal fan. Easily Megadeth's best. After this release they progressed a bit but I respect that in a band if the progression fits. 1990-1994 era of Megadeth rules big time."
4,Amazing,"After hiring Marty Friedman, Mustaine wanted to show that he was talking and seriously and that Megadeth had come to stay! So, he released a ""virtuoso"" record, full of neck-breaking time-changes, rhythms and fury. As always, his vocals are utterly bad, but the music, oh, the music...! The best Megadeth has evee done!"
5,Best Megadeth CD,"This is a classic. Go out and get this one. If not for ""Hangar 18"" or ""Holy War"", then get it because this CD is that good! Two thumbs up!"
5,Rust in Peace Remastered,"RIP contains some of my favorite METAL songs. I recommend getting the original release. Vocals are a bit shoddy on this. Highly recommended. Technical musicianship, well written. Talented band. I like the tempo changes in their songs. Retains some of the jazz from past albums. Megadeth has always been unique in the metal world. Especially the singer. Catchy songs, but not mainstream. Above average Metal album, with a couple of dueling guitarists. Similar, maybe, to Iron Maiden, they didn't wander to far from their roots over the years putting out one winner after another. Both of their catalogs are solid collections and lengthy ones at that. Put this one on your list near the top."
4,Near Classic Album,I gave the original 5 stars and this also gets 5 stars its still a classic even though the vocals were rerecorded.
2,Dave Mustaine is an @sshole!,"He remastered all his stuff and now I can't go to the music store and buy anything but this newly remastered, shiny, squeaky-clean new-sounding b.s.! I have to special order the original masters, wich is a hassle. Remastering changes the listening experience, in short it's not the same music, Dave! and now I read in a review here that he even sang new vocals on the ""improved"" remaster of the Rust In Peace album!?1? You're killin' me here, Mustaine!! The original master of Peace Sells I give a 5 star."
3,Peace sells ... but is anyone salivating?,"I remember watching these fine chaps on tour (or tur, as my grandaddy used to say) when they were with Stone Temple Pilots back in '93. Surprisingly, STP gave these guys a run for their money, though that could be because Dean Deleo and Junior hit it off so well. Rumor has it that their ""water cooler"" chats after the show were the poison of legend.But back to this record. It's pretty cool, provided you like grunge. What I'm waiting on is the new CCR. (Hey, it was the '70s, man -- everyone was doing stuff!!!!!)That's my story and I might stick to it!!!!See ya!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Oooh the travesty!,This remaster is worse then St.Anger. Get the original at any cost!! RIP is the last good effort from megadeth although it is a bit stiff. If you want flawless flowing thrash check out their earlier works.
2,not so good,"their debut was better, this album has awful lyrics like holy wars. why? i liked the first albums! mustaine voice is quite good!"
2,overated...,"There is only one reason to buy this album. Hangar 18. And if you've heard Immigrant Song by Led Zeppelin, ever, you're going to feel horribly ripped off. The people that call this a classic are the same people that call Kid Rock the great white hope of rap."
2,"If not for the bonus tracks and new booklet, I would trash this CD.","Everyone is correct in describing the butchering of the vocal tracks on this CD. I own the cassette tape that was released back in the 1990's and when compairing the tracks, I easaly noted the diffrence.What pisses me off the most is that I have to buy two copies of the CD in addition to owning the tape just to be satisfied. Thank god for MP3 players and CD-RWs."
5,This album really kicks ass!,"If you are a real Megadeth fan like me, you'll consider this album as their best even after the release of Cryptic Writings. Actually I feel disappointed when comparing C.W with a The great R.I.P"
5,MEGADETH,"A CLASSIC MEGADETH CD THAT YOU MUST HAVE. SONGS LIKE ""HANGER 18"" ""FIVE MAGICS"" AND MY FAVORITE ""HOLY WARS...THE PUNISHMENT IS DUE"". PICK THIS UP, ITS A CLASSIC."
3,Vocal remasters are a joke....,"I loved this album and wore it through several times on tape. I was excited to re-purchase on CD - but these new vocals are pathetic, almost comical in some places. Looks like I wil be buying a used original release. The original was one of the most important metal albums in history....and this is how they treat it? This should be getting 5 stars"
5,Rust in Peace: The best Thrash Album ever made!,"It doesn't get much better(if at all) than this. Since man first started to use musical instruments its moments like this that he has striven for. This includes women too. It's a fantastic ride at with twists in turns of a mini symponies. Head rattling beats and hand blistering solos. Megadeth at its best! Unlike so many, more trendy bands of the nineties, Megadeth just plays the instruments like masters and don't drone on. This is what all other bands wish they could achieve. Take a hike pop bands, this is the real thing."
4,4 1/2 Stars for a great record,"This album has mostly everything that a person would want in a metal album. Good lyrics, great song structure, and piercing solos. Out of all of these songs, I would say that ""Hangar 18"" and the title track are my personal favorites. But this record demonstrates a lost art form in heavy metal today. It doesn't have to be super heavy, with catchy riffs and guys screaming out words that mean nothing. It just has to be crunchy, rough around the edges, and actually mean something. We are so close to nuking one another right now that ""Rust in Peace"" may be fortelling the future, as did ""Holy Wars."" Overall, good listen for metalheads and rock fans alike. Peope say this is a thrash record, and I beg to differ. But that doesn't make it a bad album. I really like this album and i prefer it well over my other 'Deth record, ""Countdown to Extinction."""
5,Thrash in Peace,"this is my all time favorite megadeth album, probably my all time favorite album ever. i got this record when i was around 11 years old and i haven't stopped listening to it since. there's something about this record that makes it so appealing. dave mustaine's intelligent lyrics don't get in the way of friedman's ""look how fast i can play"" runs. this is probably the best example you'll find of dave and marty trading licks. they don't sound too perfect like on countdown to extinction-they have that live sound (which by the way, if you've never seen these guys live, you're cheating yourself out of the best show in the world). ""holy wars"" is one of the hardest rocking songs you'll find anywhere. the blues fueled ""tornado of souls"" is quite jaw dropping as well. this is a good one for all you bass players out there too, dave ellefson plays some killer licks on this one. this is a must have for anyone with ears."
5,"Fast, Furious, and Creative","This album is one of their best! The songs come fast and furious and as always, Dave Mustaine's voice is mesmerizing.The lyrics to ""Holy Wars...The Punishment Due"" are especially intense. An incredible album worth placing in a heavy metal or thrash metal collection."
5,Their best work ever.,"The title says it all, if you are interested in Megadeth, this is the pinnacle of their body of work. If you are a Megadeth fan and do not own this album, then you need to review your ""fan"" status. The band was at their technical and production peaks with Rust. The previous albums are more gritty sounding and unrefined and Megadeth's later albums are almost overproduced and the songs were radio length. Rust in Peace was a full blast thrash ride into head banger mania. A must for any metal fan."
3,Good but wildly overrated...,"Is it just me, or am I the only metal fan in the world who isn't blowing his proverbial wad over this album? Hey, I love Megadeth, but compared to their earlier, anger-fueled albums (see So Far, So Good...So What! for the prime killer), this sounds cold, vacuous, and, well, sales-oriented. It starts out promising with the masterful ""Holy Wars...The Punishment Due"", but then shifts down to cruise for almost the entire remainder of the album. This is a seriously dumbed-down 'Deth that lacks the wicked cleverness and snotty sarcasm that were so wildly entertaining. Hate to say it, but General Mustaine was a lot more fun and thought provoking when he was shooting up. I dunno, maybe I just don't get it...still a riff monster, though."
1,Missing the best track,"OK, I don't actually own this reproduction however it scares the s**t out of me that this album has been re-released without ""Take no prisoners"". which is the most powerful track on the album. This is one of the greatest heavy metal albums of all time, but it is useless without ""Take no prisoners""."
4,MY TW0-CENTS,"if its possible that there is anybody that hasnt heard megadeth before,for these people i write this reviewfor the most part,megadeth sucks.they where always regarded as one of the super powers,along with metallica,anthrax(which suck also),and the much much superior slayer,in the thrash genre.this particular album,however,doesnt suck.some of the riffs are actually pretty cool and heavy.mustaines vocals are still unbearably whiny,but the music is pretty strong.so,if you are wanting to check them out start and end here.the 4 star rating is taking into account we are talking about megadeth.under any other name it would be 3.0/3.5 stars"
2,LEFTOVERS ANYONE???,"These are leftovers from the ""FOr My Broken Heart"" album but they could never match up to that masterpiece. The title cut is dull. The rest of the CD is even more dull...like having leftovers for 3 days in a row."
5,Reba: It's My Call.,"Reba McEntire Has One Of The Beatuiful Voices In Country Music History. I Like This Album Because It Has The #1's ""Take It Back"", ""The Heart Won't Lie"" A Duet With Her Friend Vince Gill, And The Title Track. This Album Is A Must Have For Any Reba Fan."
3,Not one of her best,"Aside from a few really good songs, this album is not one of her best. It has a lot of average songs on it, but not a lot of amazing ones. I love the song ""The Heart Won't Lie"", but I get tired of the album quickly. Buy the C.D. ""For My Broken Heart"", because it is really good."
1,ANOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT!!,"Just prior to releasing this debacle, Reba recorded ""For My Broken Heart"" which I consider to be her masterpiece. What followed it up was such a disappointment. There is not one redeeming thing about this CD and all I can say is if you buy it......""Take It Back"" and trade it in for ""For My Broken Heart"" if you don't own that one already. Reba missed the call on this one!!!"
1,A BLAND AND BORING CD,"Only one song stands out: ""A Lighter Shade of Blue"". Its the only good song on here. The rest of the songs like ""Take it Back"", ""It's Your Call"", and ""Straight From You"" (which is almost the same in melody, tempo and lyric as ""It's Your Call) are just bland. ""He Want's to Get Married"" could have been good but Reba sounds extremely bored singing this. ""One Good Hand"" is the worst cut on the CD...just awful. This is one of her least worthwhile projects."
1,WHAT DID I HEAR?,"I think I heard wrong when I heard that this CD was another great one from Reba. I went out and bought it and thought...hmm...maybe I need to listen to it again. So I did. Still, no impression was made on me. So I listened again...and again....and again....It seems like she took the songs she rejected from the ""For My Broken Heart"" album and put them on here. If that is the case the album falls short because nothing could ever match up to ""For My Broken Heart""."
1,"IF ITS YOUR CALL REBA, HANG UP!!","I thought Reba's previous release ""For My Broken Heart"", the one she did before this one was superior. THen I heard ""Its Your Call"" and I wondered who placed it and why there was such a bad connection?? I agree with the one star reviews here...this is a very bad album."
1,P.U.!! TAKE IT BACK!!!!,"Most of Reba McEntire's 90s CDs are so bad they're funny. Obviously this woman, inexplicably has a huge fan base. I guess they'll buy anything she puts out. But this attempt sticks to high heaven, just like her ""Rumor Has It"" project. There is not ONE single good song in the entire bunch here. This CD was a big disappointment after her ""triumph"" in ""For My Broken Heart"", her tribute to the band members she lost in the plane crash. Reba said this was a continuation of her feelings but this CD lacks the emotional punch the former had. Some decent material would have helped her but there is not one single song here, as I said, that is worth it. Not even her duet with Vince Gill ""The Heart Won't Lie"". This is just more ""bubblegum pop/country. Reba McEntire is tremendously overrated as an artist and as a singer. She wouldn't be if she would just go back to doing ""traditional country"". This CD....P.U.!!!!"
1,NOT GOOD CREATIVELY,This CD lacks that something special that makes Reba's work special. The songs are trite and uninteresting. Reba sounds thoroughly bored throughout the proceedings.
5,Magnificent,"""Hollywood Town Hall"" was a badly needed breath of fresh air when it was originally released; a mixture of the early Flying Burrito Brothers (Marc Olson's lead vocals are a dead ringer for the late Gram Parsons) and Neil Young (lead guitarist Gary Louris' playing is equally reminiscent of Young's telegraph-like style). Is ""Hollywood Town Hall"" derivative? Sure, up to a point, but the passion is unmistakable and given the embryonic state at the time ('93 or so) of what is now called Americana, there wasn't much else available at the time that sounded like this. ""Tomorrow the Green Grass"" is probably a better album from a technical standpoint, though ""Hollywood Town Hall"" has always been a sentimental favorite, if only because I'll always associate it with the feelings one gets when they hear a favorite band the first time."
3,Take Me With You On The Road,"The Jayhawks were one of the bands who got the whole alt country thing on the road, and that really is what they're good at.Hollywood Town Hall is a perfect driving album. The songs are all short and punchy pop rock numbers with just the right amount of countrification.""Take Me With You When You Go"" and ""Waiting for the Sun"" are both classic tunes with the very slightest inclination of despair. In fact, all of the songs on this album are relatively easy listening but certainly stand up to repeat listens.The Jayhawks provide a clear illustration of how simple songs can have lasting value."
5,F'rock at its best!,"Oh, those Jayhawks...wearing their influences on their collective sleeve!This is folk rock at its best. The Neil Young influence is obvious, but these guys take their craft to a whole new level. I envy those of you who haven't heard it yet (I wasn't this pleasantly surprised by an album since I listened to Neil Young's ""Freedom"" after a decade of creative misfires..but I digress); you're in for a treat.If you have a yearning for great melodies, phenomenal songwriting, and a touch of edginess to your folk rock, then by all means, turn off your computer and go buy this album NOW! If not, then turn on your radio and catch the latest Boy Band epic.I know you'll make the right choice ;-)"
4,On their way...,"The Jayhawks are an excellent band, but Hollywood Town Hall only hints at the quality of the later classics. That said, there's much to love.Two Angels (reworked from the ragged Blue Earth LP) and Crowded In The Wings are delightful ballads and Nevada, California is up there with the band's best.A must for lovers of this whole 'new country' thing..."
4,Not your average rock album,"Is it rock? Folk? Country? Perhaps a hybrid of all these things and something more-something elusive, catchy, happy and sad all at the same time. The Jayhawks' harmonies are unlike any I've heard. Their haunting lyrics are set against upbeat melodies, bringing a curious dichotomy to their sound. Hollywood Town Hall's two best songs are Waiting for the Sun and Crowded in the Wings. This album gets 4 stars only because I also have Tomorrow the Green Grass, and it's a definite 5 star album."
2,Bland and boring,"I know a lot of people really like this cd and that's why I took a chance on it. BORING! is the word for it. They sound like a bunch of high schoolers in the basement. The same rhythm guitar in every cut, hardly ever a solid guitar riff.Maybe the other reviewers were right, this is a cd for lovers of Neil Young who is a great songwriter but hardly a great musician."
1,An exercise in mediocrity,"A CD full of forgettable and mediocre songs, with no possible need to listen more than twice, the second listening to be sure you've heard the reasons you were disappointed. This isn't progressive country i.e. Gram Parsons, etc., this is self congratulatory bubblegum."
5,One of my few favorites...,"This is my favorite record of all time. It's like a story that takes you from chapter to chapter with such amazing songstyling and vocal harmonies, All I really want to say about it, is that you are really missing out if you do not experience Hollywood Town Hall. The stuff that they do now is also very good, but here you have them in their heyday with both Olson and Louris bouncing harmonies off eachother - amazingly beautiful. They Jays also defy being labeled, so in order to explain them to my friends, I say that they are like alt.country + roots rock + power pop + a little bluegrass and a little honkytonk thrown in there too. While still being dynamically beautiful. Just listen to it even though I sound like a raving lunatic, we give the best reccomendations anyhow."
3,"An honest, rocking effort from the pre-greatness Jayhawks","It's not a brilliant album, as Tomorrow The Green Grass undeniably is. But the songs are honest, well-crafted, and they're all sturdy enough to withstand listening to over and over again. Like having a cup of oatmeal with Grape Nuts after walking back home in the snow."
4,"Very pleasing, but not their best.","Lovely harmonies - truly lovely. The songs on this album are perhaps not as strong as on 'Tomorrow The Green Grass', but the album picks you up and carries you along on the strength of the sound anyway. The first track, 'Waiting for the Sun', is still one of my favourite Jayhawks tracks."
3,This album deserves the 2 disc deluxe treatment!,"5 stars for the original album - 3 stars for this remastered version.HTH has always been my favorite Jayhawks album bar none. Great songwriting and playing on every track.I had always hoped that one day if this album gets the re-release treatment we would see a 2 disc deluxe version.Something like TTGG received - I liked TTGG it was def great too - tho it was more produced sounding (and that was planned by the band and Drakoulias) - TTGG was at the #2 spot behind HTH (for me).So with that said - I was hoping for a deluxe 2 cd version of HTH - a version with an expanded booklet with pictures from the sessions - demos, or maybe a DVD of a live concert from this HTH era.I'm grateful that the original album was remastered and expanded but was hoping and thought this album deserved a 2 disc deluxe version."
3,Im glad it was on sale.,"Not bad but a little on the repetitious side. Its like the same song over and over again. Simple is good, I like simple music, and the mood of this cd is consistent, which is also a good thing. Its just kind of mediocre all the way through. On the surface its catchy but that wears thin fast. It never takes any chances or breaks any rules. If you're looking for something new and interesting look elsewhere."
3,Searching For The Meaning Of Alt-Country,"I felt this would be a GREAT purchase, what with my musical history i.e. Neil Young, Byrds, Burrito Bros, Whiskeytown, U. Tupelo, Wilco etc.It's not happening. I am not sure if I am excited enough to give it 1000 plus spins to make it accessible.I am continuously searching for this genre but am coming up short.Pleasant, that's about it."
3,Overrated,"What to say about the Jayhawks? One doesn't want to be cruel because you get the feeling that their intentions were always pure, but there's no getting past the fact that their songwriting skills never quite kept pace with their ambitions, or their loyalties. The end result is pleasant music (in the same league as, say, the Kingston Trio or Donovan), but nothing more -- certainly not ""art"": certainly not Dylan, Parsons, Lennon/McCartney. Don't get me wrong -- you could do a lot worse that the Jayhawks; but you could also do a lot worse than Thin Lizzy or Grand Funk Railroad. Consider yourself officially warned...."
3,respectable but nothing special,"This album is bland and too innocuous. I don't dislike it, but I don't think it will stand up to repeated playing."
2,"Nothing special here, surprisingly.","I was really expecting to like this CD. I keep hearing good things about the Jayhawks, and the only song I've previously heard, ""Nothing Left to Borrow,"" was wonderfully catchy. Seemed like just my thing. ""Hollywood Town Hall,"" though, is just an expanse of blah from start to finish. There are tiny hints at greatness (""Nevada, California""), but nothing memorable otherwise. Other Jayhawks' CDs might be better, but I can't say much good about this one."
5,Love It!,"I must say that this is one of the better graphic organizer books that I have purchased. I have many of them but this one seems to be one of my tried and true graphic organizer books. I have used it for different stories, different subject areas, and different grade levels. This is a book that will not have time to collect dust! I recommend this book!"
4,Love Me Some Bonnie,"I originally bought this on cassette back in the day and it was really my first exposure to Bonnie Raitt. Now that I'm much more acquainted with her entire career, I'm more a fan of her gritty, dirty blues rather than the pop phase. I still love this album though. It's a nostalgia thing."
3,Too slow and plain,"I really liked her first two records. They were very unique , with great lyrics and interesting instrumentation. This album comes off as being safe, slow and, frankly, dull. If you don't have any Laura Cantrell records, purchase ""Not the Trembling Kind"" first."
3,"Not sold on this one, but it might grow on me...","Having adored Ms. Cantrell's first two outings, especially 'Not the Trembling Kind' (which I played obsessively, even non-stop, for three days or so after I bought it), I picked this one up the day it came out and popped it right into my portable CD player (yes, I'm one of those dinosaurs without an iPod)... and I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. She seems to have abandoned the largely traditional and stripped-down sound that made for so much of the charm of her first two CDs in favour of a ambitious palette... but one which I don't think suits her. I understand that L.C. wants to grow as an artist and not just keep cranking out what her fans expect of her over and over again, but I don't think she's playing to her strengths here......but then again, some of the music I love the most today I hated ay first hearing, so I'm willing to stick with this one - I'll get back to you if and when the penny drops!..."
2,Another crappy box set,"The Black Crowes were a good band. So why is this yet another in the long line of crappy box sets?If the title had been ""a box set of all their regularly released albums,"" it would have been acceptable. But the title states ""The Complete..."" This box set is far from complete.This box set excludes the great ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,"" ""Rainy Day Woman #12 and #35,"" and several others.Had the record company included these songs on the box set, I might have bought it. Instead, I'll go to the internet. And while I'm there, maybe get the rest!"
2,Simple at Best,"Paul is gifted, Paul is married. I'm glad he told us about it in his song ""We Got Married"". ""Rough ride"" is regular for me. ""Figure of Eight"", one could have an imagination with this one. Again, a real rocker.""That day is done"" is clearly a lesson to be heard. ""How Many People"" doesn't lack any concern for life and it's privilege. I'm rocked!""My Brave Face"" was definitely welcomed and submerged in my thoughts and as a mind of it's own. Lets face it, Paul is great by magnitude and structure. Even it's own develoment. His songs support an interesting vision. Lets get on with it."
3,Very good album but overproduced: Costello adds edge,"While I'm a big fan of evrything Beatles and their individual branches, I feel that Sir Paul just went a little too far with the production of this collection. One very bright positive aspect was the addition of Elvis Costello to the mix. He definitely added some edge to the songwriting results as well as quite possibly pushing Mr. McCartney to take his songs off in a somewhat fresher direction. Paul McCartney is immensely talented and sometimes underrated songwriter musician and even his sub-apr works shine brighter than most."
3,Inconsistant,"The problem with Mac's solo work is that he'll always hide a few gems between really bad filler. Such is the case with ""Flowers In The Dirt."" Great songs are there...""Figure of Eight,"" ""My Brave Face,"" ""This One,"" ""Put It There,"" ""How Many People,"" and ""Rough Ride."" They're unfortunately sandwiched between such clunkers as ""We Got Married,"" ""You Love Her Too,"" and the french instrumental that I can't spell or pronounce.Why does Paul record inferior material? Doesn't he know that it's not up to his standards? It seems as though he's perfectly willing to absorb critical comments about his solo work, and the tarnishing of his reputation."
3,"half very good, half very bad: why?","If you put ""My Brave Face"", ""Distractions"", Figure of Eight"", ""This One"", ""How Many People"", and maybe ""Put It There"" together, you get a damn good half album. The problem isn't just that the rest of this is bad, it's that it's mostly very, very bad--especially ""Motor of Love"". Paul, Paul, what are we to do with you?Recommended: The Proclaimers's wonderful first record (exuberant and charismatic like the early Beatles records) ""This is the Story"" and Jeff Burns's ""Pentatonic Scales for the Jazz Rock Keyboardist"", a method book."
2,FLowers,"Sacherine triviaWith the exception of the costello collaberations,this album misses the point by a country mileI'm amazed at the majority of reviews here-obviously from McCartney fans.The dedication to Chico Mendes is really a new low in McCartney lyric writing -trite,vacantly sentimental,and so loose in its generalizationsthat I found it,frankly,embarassing !McCartney's best work,Beatles apart,is his McCartney II albumand Band On The Run and Venus aand MarsOtherwise,listen to to almost any other copyist to get better work than this sentimental slush."
1,HORRID! Flee from this album.,"Im a MASSIVE macca fan, he is the best song wrier of all time. HOWEVER, this album is very dissapionting. I gave it a chance and made myself listen to the whole thing a few times but nothing struck a chord, which is very rare for a macca album, and i still cant understand why i dont like any songs on this album. One reason might be the way its drenched in 80's cliche, macca is usually ahead of his time, Tug of War was a good 80s album which kept its integrity but macca actually emerses his sonngs in unoriganallity on this letdown of an album. The other ppl who have reviewed this must like 80s music a fair bit. I can't dig it tho, if your used to the beatles 60's sound or the wings 70's sound your not gonna enjoy this album coz its far from this. If you wanna explore macca outside of wings and beatles then check out driving rain (loving flame is amazing) and chaos and creation."
4,one of the three best mccartney albums,"The sequence of the first seven songs of this album are equal to the pinnacle reached on ""Band On The Run"". McCartney's writing is at a peak with these cuts. ""My Brave Face"" is as catch a single as he has ever produced. ""Rough Ride"" is funk with substance, ""You Want Her Too"" is fun, written with Elvis Costello a'la John Lennon with a very creative ""cartoon music"" fadeout ending. ""Distractions"" is simply one of the finest songs McCartney has written, period. This ballad ranks with his best work ever. Inventive arrangements and incisive lyrics...an absolute stunner of a song. ""We Got Married"" rockss, also with sharp insightful lyrics. ""Put It There"" is a touching acoustic moment. This album trails a bit during the last four tracks, which is unfortunate. But the heights reached up to that point represent the best pop/rock has to offer."
4,Excellent,"A really fine album. Lot's of great songs (My Brave Face, Don't Be Careless Love, This One, etc...), but ""Distractions"" is the stunner. As beautiful as any song written in the last 20 years. Simply lovely. The CD would be worth it for that song alone."
3,"Not a classic, but still solid","First off, this is probably worthy of 3 1/2 stars. Many fans hail this a classic, but I find it to be merely a consistantly strong album. I love ""My Brave Face"" and ""We Got Married"", at least half the album is very good. But ""Motor of love"" and ""Don't be Careless love"" are among his worst tunes of the '80s. And on top of it, there's no real rock on this album (probably the closest is ""Figure of Eight"", which I like but still it's not really a rockin' track)."
3,My Brave Face and...uh...that's about it,"This review is for Mac fans who began as Beatles fans. Now, it may be admirable that Mac tried all kinds of things that the Beatles wouldn't have done, but unfortunately, for died-in-the-wool Beatles fans, most of these efforts are not just non-Beatlesque, but not Beatlesworthy. This album is a case in point. I think the track `My Brave Face', with Lennonesque collaboration from Elvis Costello, is the best that that duo could pull off, and it IS pleasing pop with a bit of edge to it. But their four other collaborations here (including bonus track `Back on My Feet') wear thin with repeated listenings. And the rest of the album I dare not comment on given the prevalence of 4- and 5-star customer reviews."
5,get 1989 mix of flowers in the dirt,"mcCartney's top 5 IF you get the orig. 1989 mix not the later mixes where they took out the ""touch"" he has to the ditties he writes"

Kate and Justin are so well matched they make the story come alive. Thrown into this story is a great group of secondary characters that I could not help but fall in love with.

5,This Game Rules!,"Hey there everybody! i have played some pretty cool racing games before, but this one takes the cake! i love this game! i havea an Elise Exige and a Speedster! OMG! they rule! i love the fact that you can earn money and race the other cars, others say it is difficult, but that is only because they must be bad at the game and understand nothing about it, if you think this games is frustrating and difficult then you are just niave, because i am having the best time with it, i have an ss license! that is like the highest you can get! but i didnt think it hard at all! people just need to learn how to race and customise their cars, in short, other racing games pale in comparison and eat gt's dust"
3,Rent Don't Buy,This game tryed and make a Gran Turismo game but didn't come close. It's a really fun game for like the first few weeks but then the whole game process just becomes repeditive and boring. I don't know people are different. I highly suggest rent the game and see how you like it.Once you get the GT40 the game is just effortless. You don't have to freakin try and you have so much money damage doesn't matter. The physics are pretty realistic except the car response is really slow. If your a true committed gamer to racing games you'll hate this game.
2,"half crap, half FREAKING GOOD GRAPHICS!","GT 2k2 is some what of a half baked game THE GRAPICS ARE FREGIN GOOD DONT GET ME WRONG but the gameplay is CCCCRRRRAAAAPPPPExample:I Was driving a fully tuned ,1228 HORSEPOWER,1000 KILOGRAM, FORD GT 90, 0 to 60 time: 1.5 seconds!,In a drag race against a mildiy tuned subaru wrx with415 horsepower, weighing 1200 kilos, 0 2 60 in 4-5 secondsAND DRUMROOL PLEASEI LOST BY ONE SECOND ( which is like one minute in circuit racing ) the suba-ricer finished in 8.5 seconds which shaters the real life record set by a 1227 hp skyline GTR from sweeden by like .3 secondsAnyway its a crapy game that i recommend only to those who enjoy drooling over superb grapics for hours and hours on endand thats the end of my review peace out,L33T"
3,"Fun for a while, but...","This game is basically a lesser version of Gran Turismo 3 for XBOX. It is fun for about 10 hours of playtime, but after that, I lost interest (compared to about 100 hours of GT3 playtime before losing interest). If you don't already have Project Gotham Racing, or Gran Turismo 3 and Need for Speed Hot Pursuit 2 for PS2 (don't bother with the XBOX version), those are all much better than Sega GT 2002. But if you are a racing fanatic and have already seen everything else under the sun, Sega GT 2002 will hold your interest for a week or two."
5,"Gameplay = Good, Graphics = so so?","The gameplay is excellent. The different tracks and cars available make this a 'BUYER', not a 'RENTER'. You start out with a set amount of cash to get a car, and some add-ons, then you have to race your way up to earn more $. Good concept. My only true knock at the game is the graphics. Project Gotham has better graphics. MotoGP has some of the best graphics I've ever seen in a game. Why couldn't SegaGT's graphics be a bit better??? Overall, graphics don't make the entire gaming experience, but they do add to the realism and 'suspension of disbelief' that all games strive to achieve.I'd still give this one a 5 out of 5."
2,No Grand Turisimo,"It starts off great and has potential, but the fact that their are only two seasons of races and not much challenge at the higher levels really let me down.If you are looking for the Xbox GT keep looking."
2,"no,no,no",it doesnt ketch up with project gotham which is 90 miles an hour better than this one. the cars you start off with are not enjoyable and the driving is fine but it just doesn't have the potential of project gotham racing. stay away!
4,nicely done,"This is a pretty well done game. The graphics are awesom. right down to the sun reflecting off the car which can sometimes lead you to a crash. The only bad part about that is the sun reflecting off the mirrors can be a pain. But the spectators do look like there made from cardboard.The sound is pretty good. revving the engine, braking, crashing is all done good.Lots of cool cars from Vipers to Chargers, Mustangs to GT Concepts, Corvettes, Elise Exige, mercedes. Then there are some useless and just plain horrid pieces of s**t like the Fiats, purgets and the muliple Subarus.The Ai could have been better. Since the computers cars follow a set path you can be running nicley next to a car that suddenly turns toward you becuase there's a turn coming up. It's still one of the best racing games i have played"
4,Pretty Good,"Graphics are great, i'll give it that much. The steering is horrible. At every turn it's like crash into the wall. Too hard to earn money."
3,A realistic driving simulation!!! but not that great a game.,"Sega GT is an good game. Its almost an exact copy of Gran Turismo. The graphics are beautiful, controls are good, handling of cars is realistic, the sound is great, but it lacks the fun factor.The single player game in which you play a professional racer is good. Its nice to get money to buy better cars and to buy used or new auto parts. The realism of everything is great, (but not for someone who always crashes!)I like the idea of the liscence tests.However it is so repitive! The A.I is tough, offering no difficulty setting. Its no fun when you complete so many races to buy this expensive car and then you go into a race and all your opponents have as good a car as you! Whats up with that?There is no xbox live, multiplayer is weak (4 players would have been nice.) For me, a realistic driving experience isn't my thing. But if you fancy this kind of stuff, I recommend it."
1,Fun At First....,"The game is a lot of fun at first but after two days or so, it gets really boring. The racetracks are pretty much all the same and after a few hours of playing, you get sick of seeing the same one over and over again. The graphics are kind of good but definitely not anything to gush over. And in Sega GT 2002 mode, what is the deal with the lack of complete specs on cars? One car pretty much drives like the next anyway (with a few minor differences) so I guess that doesn't really matter. After a while, you really don't care enough to keep playing. I'd rent this one from a video store, have fun with it for a few days and then return it because it definitely is not worth having on any consistent basis."
2,Not a clay/mud,"Not even close to replacing Matrix Dirty Trix. This is more like a cream that hardens in the hair. Decent hold and less shine than a gel, but not the clay/mud I was looking for."
4,no violence,"even though I'm 39 now and love all Kal-El ideaology, I hate the modern comic version. it's too violent and gruesome. I've bought this one from an independent seller. It was really well packed. Wish I could remember who I bought it from and buy some more from him."
4,Not the best design but ok and look great,"I just bought these and my daughter looks adorable. The first time I put them on she got a little fussy until she realized she could see through them.The shades come with two straps, one small and one large. My daughter is four months old and the smaller strap barely fits but the larger one is still a little big. The velcro on either side of the smaller strap is just barely attached and fits comfortably only if around the bottom of her head. In this position, her ears are a little pushed down but as the strap is soft it's not a big deal. If straight around her head, the shades are too tight and squish the area around her eyes. Even if adjusted as small as possible, the large strap is still a little too big. It should fit in another month I think."
4,Good product,"These are great, except for the fact my daughter has eye lashes that rival any Maybeline model. She would become irratated because her lashes were constantly brushing against the lenses. The strap seemed comfortable on her head, but then again she didn't wear them too long :)"
1,Not comfortable and do not fit,The shades left marks on my babies' faces and the smaller strap was too small and the bigger strap too big. I have yet to use them since they are not comfortable and do not fit. I wish they were made with a softer plastic and more adjustable back. Oh well. You live you learn!
3,the party's last album,"I wouldn't say that it lives up to the groups other albums, but there are several songs that are awesome like, I Wish You Peace, and I Only Want You. It's definately worth buying."
3,The final album from a great but underrated 90's pop group,"Got this because I had never heard it when it came out and well, it completed my collection. For a die hard fan its a must, but this (as well as the previous album Free) is more the pop/jazz/swing fusion of the mid to late 90's that I found enh."
4,TRACK LISTING - 10 SONGS (Great Amusicment):,"If you want it ""deep"" and ""spiritual"", or ""substantial"" or any of that other nonesense FORGET IT!!!!!! This band called themselves ""The Party"" for a reason! It's about THE PARTY! Unfortunately, like all parties must end in order for more substantial, deeper, or spiritual or otherwise serious things can take place, this band called it quits in the early 90s but left behind fond memories and fun music for reliving the ""good times"".1. Movin' On2. Yellow Butterfly3. I Wish You Peace4. I Only Want You5. Let's Hold On To What We Got6. Sad Memory7. Hot Fun In The Summertime8. Goin' Down9. You Dropped A Bomb On Me10. Forgive Me Girl"
4,Good Gate,"This gate has been good so far. The instructions for installation weren't very good, and that is why I didn't give it 5 stars. Just be careful when ordering the extension bars, as it comes with a 2 bar extension that is a fixed 5.75 inches already so you have to take that into consideration when ordering any other extensions. We have a 48"" space we are using the gate in, so I ordered the 5 bar 14 inch extension thinking it would adjust, but with the fixed 2 bar extension the gate was just too long, so I didn't use the 2 bar and only used the 14. This leaves a gap on each end bigger than the 2.75 inches recommended, but it work fine."
4,Great pressure mount gate for top of stairs,"My husband and I purchased this gate to reduce damage to our walls and have a sturdy top of stairs gate, as we have a steep staircase with several stairs. The gate is very sturdy, and overall is easy to install. The only tricky thing about the installation is knowing how to properly lift and open the gate after tightening the screws. The gate does close on its own without having to lift the gate and handle as the instructions mention, but after looking at the packaging at how the gate is supposed to look after it is installed, and how to lift the door, we had to tighten the screws further into the cups on the wall to achieve the proper closure. Would recommend this gate to those with small children, as it is very sturdy, but if there are elderly persons in the household, they may need assistance in opening the gate."
1,Amazon lied to me,"I purchased this gate because the description specifically stated that no mounting hardware was required. You lied. It does require mounting cups to be glued or screwed to a wall. I bought this because I only wanted it installed temporarily while our dog is a puppy, so I did not want to leave any marks on the wall. Had I known it required hardware, I would have bought something else. Further, I am glad I bought it to keep my puppy from wandering in the house and not to keep a child safe. The latch is useless because I can push it open with very little force."
4,This is a winner,"I love this gate. My dog doesn't appreciate it though. It is well constructed and comes with an extension in case I want to use it on my much wider back yard gate. He likes to watch me when I wash my car or something, so I just move the gate. I wish it came with more little white plastic things that I could permanently put in place in other locations. They aren't really necessary but it would be more efficient. Love it. Really, get it. You have to explain to new people how to open it, but that it is child-proof is a plus for me."
2,"good product, but delivered broken.","This may have been a good product, but the boxes arrived damaged and the gates broken. (I bought two) Absolutely not the carriers fault. Amazon did such bad packing, there was no way it could have survived the trip. And since the delivery box was damaged, I would have to pay the local pack and ship to return the damaged gate and then wait for replacement.With a new puppy in dire need of gating, I went to the local PetSmart and bought this product off the shelf from them. Should have done that in the first place and saved myself the hassle. The Amazon extension is headed to the trash.As a side note, I also bought the gate extensions, and those arrived not damaged, but destroyed. An even worse packing job by amazon."
1,Gate with Missing Parts,"Recieved the gate with parts missing. When I notified Amazon, they indicated repair/replacement parts were not available and I would have to return and reorder the product. As my wife needed it, this was not possible. This is not a reflection of Amazon but on hte manufacturer."
3,Autoclose gate - Not,This product functions as a gate but does not autoclose unless it is very close to already being closed. I have another autoclose gate that works exactly as advertised. I would not buy this one again if you are looking for the autoclose feature.
4,"Sturdy, but noisy","Much sturdier than any plastic gate we tried. Make sure you measure the space and get the correct extensions to fit. There is very little leeway in terms of the width, you have to have the right extensions to fit. Makes a pretty loud noise when it closes, which is an issue for us as it's right next to the nursery at the top of the stairs. Doesn't require drilling for top-of-stairs use which is nice. The opening isn't real wide so maybe not good for older or wider people."
5,Great Gate!,"Don't have to drill into your walls to keep your kids (human or pet) in (or out) of a room...sturdy, closes itself, can buy extensions for wide spaces...no complaints!"
3,"Seems sturdy, but can't get it down","We have an open floor plan and needed to gate off a wide space with an irritating combination of hollow walls, baseboards, and hidden wiring. After trying numerous gates, this is the only one that fits the space (when using extensions) and actually seems quite sturdy. The problem is that when we went to loosen the ""tamper proof"" hand-wheels a bit in order to adjust the gate, we couldn't do it, and the instructions weren't terribly helpful. I'm not actually sure how we'll ever get the gate down at this point. I think we'll just have to kick it down when it comes time to move."
3,Good gate but...,"My overall impression of this gate is good, it's doing the job it been made for, my daughter can no longer escape from her room. But the gate could be improved in some points.Pros:-the gate is in metal and it's steady-nice simple design-automatic closingCons:-the ""click"" when the gate is closing is loud-not really pressure mounted, you've to use either the nail or stick the ""pads"" to fix the gate to the door-a little bit to small for a 34 inches door, and too large with the extension, we had to extend the screw almost entirely-automatic closing, a bit annoying at night especially, so I've prevent the door to close with a towel-hard to open with one hand, if you're carrying your baby it's hard to do it"
5,I Love this gate,We got this gate to keep our minature dachshunds from running off everytime some one came in the front door. We have an entry area that we were able to block off with this gate using the gate with the longer gate extension piece. Now when the kids go in and out the dogs are automatically kept back away from the front door by the autoclosing feature on the gate. The kids don't have to remember to close it and once they are on the other side of the gate they can fiddle around at the front door with it open and we don't have to worry about the dogs getting out.
4,Nice beginning blues guitar,This is a nice guitar with a dirty almost distorted sound great for playing a blues rhythm. This dope says it sounds like a horror movie and I agree! I make her scream and holler at the top of her strings! This is the kind of guitar you want if you want to emulate the true sound of Robert Johnson or Ole Keef when he was Exiled on Main St. but if you're looking for a clean pristine sound you better look elsewhere because this is the Git-fiddle that Johnny used to rock the socks of the devil himself. The guitar has got a voice to match mine. The best way to describe the type of sound is to listen to JS Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor... Nuff said.
2,horrible sound.,"I got this guitar over a year ago. It has a got that sorta depressing,ugly horror movie sort of sound to it. I would not suggest you to buy this ever. I would suggest getting a guitar by a much more known brand instead, such as a good Yamaha guitar thats about $150-$250. This guitar is the worst guitar I have ever heard and even a good guitar player will not sound good on it."
2,Give me their old stuff...wife likes it.,Not into their later stuff as it sounds so polished and ballads bound...give me the 70s rock...wife grew up on this and likes it.
4,Best Heart record,"This is by far my fave Heart album. Great production, great songs both ballads and rockers. One of the best album in the AOR genre."
4,"Cool,hard-rocking album!","BRIGADE is the follow-up to 1987's BAD ANIMALS,and Heart's third album on the Capitol label. It contains the smash hit ALL I WANNA DO IS MAKE LOVE TO YOU. Other hits include SECRET,I DIDN'T WANT TO NEED YOU and STRANDED. The label of the compact disc has a very attractive concept. While promoting this album,Heart recorded the live follow-up ROCK THE HOUSE LIVE! at the Centrum in Worcester,Massachusetts on November 28,1990. Live versions of WILD CHILD,TALL DARK HANDSOME STRANGER,THE NIGHT,FALLEN FROM GRACE,UNDER THE SKY and CALL OF THE WILD appear on RTHL."
5,"A ""Must"" for Every Heart Fan","This is by far one of Heart's best CDs ever! Of course, the runaway hits are there but there are truly beautiful songs that are less well-known, such as Under the Sky and I Want Your World to Turn, to name a couple. By far, this is my favorite of all of their albums."
2,CD,Wasn't as good as I had hoped. I still like heart but this one didn't appeal to me. Sorry. Maybe next time.
2,LA Hip-Hop Crew Stuck in Second Gear,"Despite breaking through with the Kanye West-assisted This Way in 2004, Dilated Peoples have created a niche for themselves, devoid of mainstream hip-hop's frills and the eccentric creativity of the left-field. Their once-commendable stoicism now translates as banality, not aided by this lacklustre set, filled with beats that Eminem would be ashamed of. The malaise even extends to some very ordinary scratching from the usually impeccable DJ Babu, while it takes guest Talib Kweli to deliver the LP's best verse on Kindness For Weakness."
3,20/20 is a Decent Album.,"20/20 is the latest hip hop puzzle from Dilated Peoples, after the neighborhood and other albums, Dilated Peoples are doing just fine, there are some flaws in some songs, but it has some heart and some soul, 20/20 is a decent and nice album.So Thumbs Up for Me."

1,"Good Cover, pity the contents are rubbish","One can see problems with this book right from the beginning when the author states she is only a poor female. There are plenty of descriptions of the fuel tank system, but the author provides no evidence to support her claim. Her conclusion was that the vents were accidentally left closed, but she cannot back this up. She also claims that there are plenty of sparks in the fuel tanks of the 747 frequently. Rubbish. She also refuses to indicate where the spark that brought down TWA 800 originated. There is some evidence that a shoulder-fired missile brought down the aircraft, yet she only discounts friendly-fire rather than terrorist activity. Thinking of buying this book? Do not bother. There is nothing but unsubstantiated nonsense. The author stated she wanted to discount all the nonsense, but she has only added to it."
1,There IS Air in the Tank's Ullage,"The only time that there is only fuel vapor in the tank's ullage (the area in the tank above the fuel level) and in the vent lines, occurs when the airplane is stationary on the ground or during low-speed ground operations. The design of the vent system includes a scoop under each wing tip oriented into the relative wind which acts to slightly pressurize each tank through the vent lines that run laterally from surge tank to surge tank. This acts to evacuate the fuel vapors from the ullage and also to put a ""head"" pressure on the fuel to decrease the vapor formation."
1,Are you smoking crack,"Have you ever seen the size of fuel lines? Do you know what combustion is? Do you know how to light a match? A candle? Do you have any idea of the components involved between the combustion chamber on the CENTER fuel tank? First of all you have small fuel injectors which are about the size of the tip of an ink pin, then you have a fuel line which is about 1/4 inch in diameter and it probably runs more than 100 feet before it gets to the fuel tank. There has to be Oxygen for the fuel to burn. How does this happen? Please don't write about something you don't have a clue about! Take up checkers or something."
5,Best I have read so far,"This is by far the best non-fiction on the show I have read so far. This book is very well-researched, very well-written, and very well-organized. I reccommend this book to anyone whom is interested in television studies, popular culture studies, how televison and theology relate, and of course, the study of the show its self. Go buy it now!!"
5,Fun alernative to the usual Xmas music,My feet started tapping a few seconds after pressing play! Very nice use of retro Casio keyboards. Amazing sound.
4,"Amazing art, limited story","I bought this to add to my growing graphic novel collection as I love the medium and perspective. The art is expert and dramatic, no question. The story ending is disappointing to me, i.e. shows the main character's downfall, but I won't say more about that. The artist is singular because of the woodcuts so that aspect is inspiring."
4,in the canon of Camp,"Susan Sontag, in her ""Notes of Camp,"" included ""God's Man""--along with the drawings of Aubrey Beardsley, the operas of Bellini, and the original ""King Kong""--in the canon of Camp. The novel does have a poignant simplicity. The characters are not human but symbols. The work resembles exquisite high-school poetry, dramatic, overly so. Redolent of a pubescent sexual fear. Cannot be taken seriously and as such must be taken seriously."
1,M. Scott Peck's opinion of this book,"I quote from GLIMPSES OF THE DEVIL, p. 215: ""...after spending a half hour with that book, GODS' MAN. I called [a nun, six years my senior, who has been my spiritual director for more than twenty-five years] sobbing with a complex of emotions, including hatred for the author, disgust at the book, rage at its destructiveness, sorrow for all the other young boys and girls who had been the book's victims, and a feeling of deep contamination that I had received just from looking at it. After we spoke, I sent her my newly purchased copy and she called me back to agree that it was the single most destructive thing she had ever seen in her fifty-plus years."" Undoubtedly, Dr. Peck's strong emotional reaction was due to the destruction the book wrought in the life of one of Peck's patients. But now you are forewarned."
2,Cost of information per the book and it's offering.,I was reading this book primarily for details to add to a genealogy project. This book supplied me with an amazing amount of the basic information about the invasion. Price is OK for a paperback.
1,This game sucks,"DONT BUT THIS GAME UNLESS MOB THUGS PROMISE TO KILL EVERYONE YOU LOVE IF YOU DONT. OTHERWISE STEER CLEAR OF THIS HORRIFIC GAME. GTA, SPLINTER CELL, OR RAINBOw SIX THREE ARE ALL MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH BETTER"
1,i can't tell you,i can't write a review since i havent receivd my game yet. i ordered it on the seventeenth and it is now 9 o'clock p.m. on the 21st. i thought this game was supposed to be 24 hour delivery. i am very angered over this because i could have ran to the store down the block and gotten it for the same price.
4,Sweet Game,I thought this game was really [bad] at first. But after several hours of figuring out the controls the game really started to show its true colors. I think if your into story games and stealth this game is a definite buy.
4,"Hard; imaginative; mind-bending, sophisticated fun","FPS fans, stop a moment. THis is a thinking man's FPS/ third person action/adventure. You can toggle viewpoints back and forth. This isn't Doom. The LAST thing you do is bomb through some room, blazing all over the place.Gorgeous game on all production levels, excellent controls, great story, everything you want. But damn, it's hard. Be prepared to die a lot and repeat a lot.The cool thing is that there is more than one way to get things done. The more stealthy and less mistakes you make, the more rewarded will you be.All the problems with the first game have been fixed. Highly recommended for all systems and PC!!!"
2,"""one player"" option only","The description doesn't say it, but this game is only for one player only. I was really hoping there'd be a two-player mode. Oh, well."
4,do not miss this one,"It would be a mistake to term this a first person shooter because it is not 'run and gun'. This tactic will not work for you. The first person mode is probably the smoothest I have seen. However, the third person view can be distracting when making quick turns. Unlike other mission based games, it is very open ended as to how you accomplish your mission. This can be daunting at first, but you soon catch on. The controls are not as intuitive as Halo, and at some points become quite frustrating. If you like games that allow you the freedom of creative thinking...and you have a little bit of patience...I strongly recommend this title. Also, this is the only game that I have played that I have not shut off the music. The score truly adds to the drama and suspense."
4,A strong debut on the Xbox,"Pros: 1. Much Better than it's predecessor2. A limited # of saves, which makes you think about where to save the game.3. The option of a 1st or 3rd person shooter in the game4. The only game that lets you decide to stealthfully execute your target, or just walk in and shoot everybody5. Threat Meter is a good addition to the game.6. good music score7. more than one way to finish each level8. can change uniforms to disguise yor self as the enemyCons: 1. AI has faults in it2. acting is poor3. The storyline is just sad4. nothing much to do in the long runFinal Verdict: My opinion is that if you are a hardcore gamer that loves a good shooter, buy it. If not, rent it."
1,a i dont now if i should buy costumer,I am not shoure i should buy this game because the first HiTman released was very very hard to accomplish I didn't finished the 1st game so if I were you I wont buy it until you play the DEMO or something related
2,Not Happy,I just got Hitman 2. The game is a waste of money. Controls are difficult and at times frustrating. Camera keeps getting in the way. The graphics don't take advantage of the XBox hardware. I'd wait for Splinter Cell or buy Halo.
4,good game,"the game is your choice of either first or third person views, in several reviews people say they hated that it had a first person view / third-person view. you can choose which view you want and alternate between views during the game. had to clear that up. and ya, you should probably rent it and see if you like it, it isnt for everyone."
4,Might be good,Probably a good game like most Hitman ones are. However I didn't realize this was Xbox only. This cannot be played on Xbox 360 like some other games can be.
4,Fun but really a shooter,"Graphics...so-so, acceptable. Musical score...outstanding. Sound effects...decent. You can accomplish each mission in more than one way so lots of replay value. Next to impossible to use a disguise up close, so it becomes a shooter game....not that that's totally bad. The main character can kill with weapons but cannot throw a punch... Don't use anesthetic, they wake up too soon, either avoid or kill. Would be nice to be able to throw a punch. All in all I liked Splinter Cell better, but it is still a nice game. I rate it a 3.5 rounded up to 4. You will have some fun..."
5,This Is A Real Gme,The whole reason why I give Hitman two a five star because it has a good game plot good gameplay.One other thing is it has a good 3-D engine. The only problem is its controlls it.is sometimes difficult to monover but it is still a five star game.
3,"Save your money, just rent it","Hitman 2 is an okay game. That sums it up. The innovation is OK, the controls are OK, the graphics are OK. It's just an average kind of game. A lot of people seem very hyped over the ""thinking"" aspect of the game. That is - you can't just go in shooting. That's partially true, although brute force remains very effective. (why else would you be armed with AK47's and submachine guns?)But stealthy games have been done before, and done better. In Hitman 2, it's usually pretty obvious what you need to do to accomplish a mission.Don't get me wrong, it's still a good game. The enemy AI is pretty good - they know when you're in the wrong place wearing the wrong disguise. And for that matter, it's pretty cool to be able to change into any enemy's clothes to disguise yourself. So I encourage you to rent this game; it's fun for a while. But save your money. There'll be better games."
1,Activated Charcoal,"I was trying to order activated charcoal to help with a musty smell in my crawl space. I ordered Activated Charcoal but I received Premium Carbon-Ammonia Neutralizing Blend. The container states ""Harmful if Inhaled"". I am going to return this product and try once again to order Activated Charcoal for Odors."
5,Wonderful product.,I love this stuff. I use it in all my tanks and my water is crystal clear and no smells. I would recommend this product to anyone. I also like the fact it helps keep the ammonia levels down.
1,buyer beware,A single page of facts that anyone can obtain for free on wikipedia- however wikipedia has ten times the content on Neisser.. dont waste your time here..
3,ok but drags on,"it is actually an ok plot, but it drags on a bit sometimes. however,its worth it because it is free! i love cats and the cat in this is evil. :("
3,I deserve more,"I have no idea why it is taking the DVD gods so long to create, ""The Steve Harvey Show Season One"" on DVD. What is up with that? You just can't go around creating a five-episode DVD, when there are so many other good episodes all willy-nilly. I have emailed Mr. Harvey about this, but naturally, I did not get a return response. Like the many other loyal fans of the show, I will keep watching this DVD and its' same five episodes, because they are just that good. Peace!!!"
3,"Review for Best of the Steve Harvey Show, Vol. 1","Although the episodes were funny, the DVD itself was too short. There weren't enough episodes in this volume. It makes me kind of feel like I overpaid."
4,Pretty good.,"This is a great cd if you like Dean Martin, but aren't out to own his every cd. The first two tracks are a little annoying, but all the others are really enjoyable. It's nice, easy listening music that would be ideal for someone just getting introduced to Dean Martin."
4,THE BEST,"I THINK THE SONG THE ROCKAFELLER SHANK IS THE BEST SONG EVER. I ALSO LOVED THE MOVIE SHE'S ALL THAT BECAUSE THIS SONG WAS PLAYED, WHAN I HEARD THE SONG ON THE MOVIE, I FREAKED OUT. I REALLY WANT THIS CD. I DONT HAVE IT YET THROUGH. I AM 10 YEARS OLD. MY NAME IS VICKY SMITH."
5,Great!,"This song is so Awesome! The first time I ever heard it was on the movie ""She's All That"" and I've loved it ever since then. It is my favorite part of the whole movie."
5,Don't miss it.,"Every reviewer has commented on the brilliance of the first five songs, but seems to miss the last five on this album. They are absolutely wonderful. ""Dreidel"" evokes the feeling of helpless spinning out of control with unparalleled vocals. And ""Prime Time"" may be one of the greatest anti-war and ""what the hell is up with American priorities?"" songs ever written. This c.d. is great all the way through, and is a must-have."
4,Don Mc Lean is a great artist!,"I just received this CD and have almost worn it out. I especially enjoy listening to the first five selected songs! The orchestrated music,lyrics,combined with his great voice emits a warm fuzzy feeling one gets from days past. I'd love to hear more from present day Don Mc Lean! Amazon.com did an awesome service to this customer. Thank you for making this selection available."
2,An OK collection,"I bought this in 1993, & I was a bit disappointed that ""Castles In The Air"" is a re-recorded version & not the original version I had back in the 70's as the original flipside of the United Artists single ""Vincent"". I used to love ""American Pie"" until radio overplayed it to death, now my favorite McLean song is the last song here, ""Prime Time"", though I don't know when it came out."
5,OUTSTANDING SONGS,"Not a prolific artist, Don McLean's small body of work does contain some brilliant compositions. American Pie is a magnificent epic in the folk or singer/songwriter tradition, an avalanche of cinematic surreal images set to a memorable tune. It has been said that McLean outdylaned Bob Dylan here! Madonna certainly likes it as she recorded it recently. Vincent, about the painter Vincent Van Gogh, is perceptive, gentle and poignant and reminds me of Anne Sexton's poem Starry Night from the book To Bedlam And Part Way Back. And I Love You So, a hit for Perry Como in the seventies, is a gorgeous love song, Castles In The Air is sad and moving and McLean demonstrates his interpretive skills on this lovely cover of Crying. The aforementioned tracks are light years ahead of the rest but they're so unique and gripping that I gladly award this album 5 sparkling stars."
2,Don't waste your money or time on this one...,"This is awful. It is a UK edition which is important to know. All of the questions are British based and hard as heck, for example ""What year did Def Leppard's Pyromania album go to #3 in the UK charts""...Number 3? Why? Also, there are several typos and it is multiple choice and often times the same answer was listed twice on the same question. There is an American Rock segment but it is so easy that a 4 year old could answer them. I purchased this for my boyfriend's birthday party. We were all thirty-something music buffs. I was seriously disappointed. So was everyone else."
1,Child hated it,"This held my child's interest for a whopping 2 minutes, and he refused to play with it any longer. Really, it's a bunch of soft cars that don't roll, are difficult to push and don't stay stacked. Don't waste your money."
1,Vroom Vroom Cars,Are these different from the IQ Baby Vroom Vroom cars which were recalled due to wheels coming off and becoming a choking hazard?
3,"Good, but not for the USMLE","I would not recommend this book for USMLE quick preparation. Too much information for Board preparation, and too much unrelevant information in this book at all. I have spent a lot of time to ""digest"" it (altough it seems so thin). I am still not satified with my knowledge. Some topics are very mixy and some of the drug trade names are old already. ....Do not spend your time on this edition, chaps!..."
1,Don't know,"I'd love to write a review of this product but the problem is that I never got it. Maybe I never will, who knows?"
3,Jam Band,"Good disk for jam band fans. I found it a bit weaker than some of his later releases, where he focused more on commercial hits. It is very typical for the times, with extended bluesy jams, and short on lyrical hooks. Interesting, none the less."
5,Brave New World by Steve Miller Band,"I bought the disc for 1 song, the ever cool Space Cowboy.I liked it the first time I heard it, and I liked it thelast time I heard it."
4,Great Video,Good video that helps you to walk through your Canon Rebel XSi. If you are new or have had your Canon for some time then this video is for you.
4,Beyond the Reality of ONE,"This author shows us a different view of the world that is imaginative and quite thought provoking. The book is filled with interesting ideas, concepts and characters. The well-developed characters, and the flow of the story, keep you thinking and turning the page. A very enjoyable read!"
3,It misses the mark.,"This was a long and rather tedious book to read. It never roared until the final chapters. The coincidences defied any reality. In sum, it is a book I cannot recommend. It will likely be my last John Lawton novel."
1,not worth reading,I heard a wonderful radio interview with the author and couldn't wait to read Old Flames. Unfortunately it was trite & predictable. I kept thinking it would get better but with only 55 pages to go I stopped reading it because I realized I didn't care who did it or anything else.
3,"Ponderous, But Good","I think Lawton tried to do too much in this novel and the result was mostly a complicated yawner, with some good -- if unlikely -- excitement at the beginning and at the end. Understanding and enjoying this book depends to a large degree on having read Lawton's earlier book, ""Black Out,"" since several of the key characters in this book also played important roles in the earlier. But still, this book vividly conveys the tone of life in post-War England, specifically the mid-50s when Khrushchev was stirring the world pot and England decided to invade Egypt. For my money, Lawton drifts away from the main plot too often. He calls on many characters to carry the load and soon you need a score card to tell who's who. Lawton is the equal, if not the better, of guys like Le Carre,Furst and Deighton, but I feel this book was not as good as its predecessor, ""Black Out."" But still good."
4,The Influence of the Gibbs Before They Were Famous,"Clocking in with 31 remastered songs from 'down under', a dozen or more famous Australian artists from the early sixties display their cover versions of Gibb written songs. If you are not Australian, chances are you've never heard of Col Joye, Jimmie Little, Sandy Summers or Bip Addison. It doesn't matter. What does matter is that these very rare tracks have turned up, showing that even before the world heard of the Bee Gees, they were already making an impact on Australian music charts (albeit, they never had a hit themselves until the week they left for England!). The sound is typical of that era, but the maturity of most of the songs are amazing, given that the Gibbs were writing them as pre-teens/teenagers. The Bee Gees consider themselves songwriters first and this set proves that they were right on the money from the start."
1,Medley-not complete songs..Traileros,"This CD does not contain full songs. EVERY track is a partial song. Example: ""Abeja Reyna"" track length 1:30 and not the full 3 minutes. Not recommended for Traileros fans. This is a complete waste of money. A medley not well done and poorly arranged. Not a good CD."
4,Great Look at Heaven,"I've now read 3 Jerry Walls books and they have all been great. One of the things that strikes me about Walls is his non-dogmatic approach to his theology and philosophy. This is evident in this book. Not only is this responsible speculation of what heaven may look like, it is a solid defense of the logic of heaven in the face of so much modern skepticism on the topic. I really enjoyed his ""purgatory for almost everyone"" as it would certainly resolve much of the tension created when consideration is not given to some type of post-mortem purification. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is at times Walls seems to drift off topic making it difficult to follow. This is a very intense book and I had to read some sections multiple times to grasp the meaning. You will definitely enjoy this book as it combines philosophy with theology and covers a wide range of views on the topic, both ancient and modern."
5,Great deal!,I was really happy with the telescope - it was a good buy too.I bought one for a friend also
1,It served me well as I can not see much of anything other than the moon or not if I can not use.,It served me well as I can not see much of anything other than the moon or not if I can not use.
1,Not amused,"My one (returned) had a broken part on the mount, and was way far out of collimation. Also, of course at this very low price point, no way to adjust the collimation. Foil tabs sticking into the field of view *(the foil i think is used to aid in the separation of the two elements in of the objective lense) is ok, and common since the 1950's in small cheap achromatic refractors. But the three screws that hold the tube onto what i assume is the lense cell, is NOT.Do not purchase this as a gift for a young person, unless of course, you want to insure they never develop and interest in astronomy. Yes, it is cheap. But it is not worth any amount, since if you get it and do not return it, it will take up space in your home, or garbage can."
2,Disappointing Quality,"Scant vegetables and beef. Surprisingly little barley. Gloppy texture. Much too salty. Does not taste fresh. Needed addition of fresh vegetables to be edible. Hard to believe, but Campbell's is better!"
2,Love Story on Steroids,"This book is a ""ready-made soap opera."" If one expects much real flying adventure,they will be very disappointed, as I was. Of course,the author, having only 22hrs in a Cessna 152 trainer, and not being a licensed pilot, can't possibly write about flying with any authority. Yuk! It drips with sap AND soap!"
1,A disappointment,"Where I expected facts and sources as promised by the blurbs about this book, I found less. Far-fetched theories, conjecture, lack of credible sources, and a number of outright mis-cites where the source did not support the allegation. All that, woven with enough checkable stuff that Mr. Wasserman hopes will rub off on his theories. Just because something can happen does not mean it did happen. If he thinks the republicans orchestrated and executed a ""theft"" of the election, he certainly has not demonstrated it here. And of course the 2008 results, a clean election with fully defined results, make the second half of the book's title nothing more than a chuckle. If you're right Mr. Wasserman, you'll need to do better than this."
1,disappointing book,"After reading some of the author's writings and reading about him, I was very excited to read this book, since I have never forgotten how the 2004 election was stolen in Ohio, New Mexico and Florida, but especially in Ohio. It was a colossal disappointment. From page 1 it is full of exaggeration and innuendo, rather than facts. The style is irritating--it reminds me of the propagandistic sound bites of Fox news and commentary. What an important opportunity they squandered!"
5,Great boat gift,Gave to friends that purchased their first yacht. Loved it and have been asked several times where it was from. what a perfect boat gift!!!
5,Coolest Mermaid on the Dock,"Perfect conversation starter. I don't actually use her as a boat fender, ""Lola"" just hangs around on the dock looking pretty."
4,Good brain fun,These are fun brain teasers that get every one thinking out side of the box. They are great for all ages.
1,Raga Bhankar by Ustad Vilayat Khan,"It is difficult to write about Bhankar, as this is a very uncommon Raga with almost unknown character. Sometimes it sounds like Bhatiyar, then there is a touch of Bhairav and also general Poorvi thaat. I guess this Raga could be played at any time. About Khansaab's playing, it really doesn't bring any color and never really rises to any height. For last several years its been noticed that whenever the great Ustad does his famous 'Gayaki Ang' work, he quite frequently goes out of tune which is quite hurting to the ears. After this CD, Ustad Vilayat produced a similar one, called Kedar-Bhankar. It is almost a repetition, except there is more strength to 'Shuddha Ma' as in 'Kedar'. Again, there is no particular color of that Raga. In both cases, the performance is quite depressing. I wish I could have given a better review for one of our greatest musicians."
1,Non-consensual sex in a military sexual harrassment scene,"Sorry, this one left me cold. There was no consent of the submissives, which I view as critical to S/M. I also had a tough time with the premise: sexual harrassment on board a navy ship. Too close to the headlines."
5,Classic,"Just like I remembered. Great Game Plenty of Challenges, but easy enough to play right out of the mailer, no box."
5,Life saver!,I was having a terrible time with adult acne and other acne products were either too drying and/or too expensive. This product cleared my blemishes and I finally have clear skin!
3,The book,This book is extemely boring in the beginning just talking about the genie but some how this arabic book had some sense in it. This book is not for everyone since to some people it's not interesting. But this book is worth buying
3,Not as bad as I expected.,"On the one hand, its unfortunate that a subject this serious is presented as a string of cliches (I kept thinking of Predator as they worked their way through the jungle). On the other hand if it makes people realize that the real carnage is in Africa, not Iraq then its a good thing.Its nice to see Americans fighting for something worth fighting for...too bad its fiction. My only real criticism is that, like Training Day, this movie just goes on forever! After they blow up the bad guys, it continues. After the people get to safety, it continues. After Bruce gets his well deserved pat on the back, it continues. And the attack aircraft that save the day arrive so late they almost miss the movie. Sounds suspenseful but actually its pretty boring."
2,terrible movie,"This is probably the worst Bruce Willis movie, and that's saying a lot. The acting is stiff and the plot is thin. Not even all the action scenes can make up for it. The parts that are supposed to be emotional are dry and unconvincing. The movie is, in a word, boring. I'm glad I rented this one and didn't buy it. I would have given it one star, but the action was pretty decent."
1,Not worthwhile,"Picture quality is impacted because so much of this film is shot in very dark conditions. Also, someone on the production team seems to think that Bruce Willis' face can be substituted for good scenery. I bet his face took up half of the overall area on film for this movie. My biggest single gripe is that I found the plot completely implausible, and the characters impossible to get attached to."
1,America wants to protect christians. And oil deposits too.,"Next country (which will be ""liberated"" by americans)will be Nigeria. Because Muslims molest christians. That is the clear message from this film."
5,Great Picture and Sound Quality,"This review is only of the technical aspects of the disc, not the film itself. You may have heard that this disc is one of the best out of the early Blu-ray releases. That's absolutely true. The uncompressed PCM 5.1 soundtrack is the best sound quality I have heard so far in a consumer software release - we'll see if the recent Fox titles with DTS-HD Master Audio tracks can best it. The picture quality is extremely good, in the top 10-20% of current Blu-ray releases (as of Thanksgiving 06)."
1,Sincerely embarrassing,"Watching this movie, your body feels more stressed and hemmed in by the constant assault of sacharine liberal platitudes than the impending arrival of genocidal militias, which you almost forget about. By the film's excrutiating end, I was half expecting the helicopters to disembark a team of chiropractors. It's hard bashing something that is so sincere, you feel like a bully. However, might I suggest putting on the cans and listening to Peter Gabriel's Biko over and over for two hours while looking at postcards of Bruce Willis and Africa? The pain will remain the same but will work out cheaper."
2,very amateurish,"This movie was a huge disappointment, in my opinion. The mission (rescuing a doctor who does not want to be rescued) is absolutely ridiculous, especially after sitting through the whole thing to find out why she was so important, and still never finding out. The ground tactics were embarrassing....mistakes that even the greenest of Basic Training graduates would never make. Who in their right mind would think it was a good idea to stand upright and walk right into 300 enemy soldiers who are firing on you? No wonder they got chewed up so badly. The only redeeming value of this movie is that it MIGHT open the eyes of SOME people to the atrocities that are going on in Africa even as we speak."
2,Disappointed!,"After watching tis movie, i will only recommend people to watch tis for 2 reasons: firstly, the touching moments of war movies and, secondly, for Bruce Willis.I was pretty disappointed tat there wasnt much excitement of the usual bombing and blasting of a war movie. A different twist to war movies? Maybe. And most of the time the scenes were too dark to make out wat was goin on! Sure it was touching but i was kinda expecting more from tis movie. If you have time, watch it. If not, u can skip it."
2,Abandon This Mission,"Let me be the first to say that I really wanted this movie to be great. Antonie Fuqua, Bruce Willis, Eammon Walker, Monica Bellucci and the rest of the cast really deserve for this film to succeed. Unfortunately, the film fails them in way too many ways to give it a good review. I agree with those who say that the film tackles interesting topics. I agree with those that say that the film is a technically competent film. But aside from a few histrionics by the ENTIRE cast (you'll know which scene I am referring to), the film makes no attempt to develop ANY of the characters beyond ""plot funtions"". And there are too many gaps in logic for this film to even begin to make sense."
1,Don't waste your time,"You can figure out the end line of this movie within the first ten minutes. Even in terms of seeing this movie as just entertainment was difficult trying to accept the totally ridiculous decisions made by the Lieutenant (Bruce Willis). What Navy Seal would totally disobey the orders of his Commanders and knowingly risk the lives of his men and take on people he's not supposed to save, risking their lives, while at the same time the producers of this movie fail to make their heroic escape from 500 rebel soldiers look even half way believable??"
1,Horrible movie,"This is not just a horrible movie its a movie that gives the average person a fantasy impression of the military. If Bruce Willis's character was a real life officer he would have been court martialed and done 20 years in Levenworth, and rightfully so. This movie is way to far off the diving board, even for Hollywood."
1,Apple pie and all that....,"In my opinion, this movie deserves a one-star rating (even though I found the last 20-minutes quite funny). I particularly liked Willis' final comment....""here, help her, she needs medical attention"" when he's standing there seriously wounded (first, by a machete) then shot numerous times. I enjoyed the captain of the aircraft carrier miraculously showing up within minutes after the last altercation with the ""rebels"", as well. Particularly because it took the two fighter jets quite some time (at hyperspeed) just to get to the battle site.Corny, apple pie, terribly overacted... and most of all ridiculous. We all know, don't we, that Americans never need to load their guns... the bullets just seem to keep coming. I rate this one right in there with John Travolta's Broken Arrow. Same genre', only a bit more foolish. Believe me, this one will be forgotten quickly!"
3,Inanity!,"The whole movie lacks coherence. First, a soldier disobeys direct orders, but yet his commanding officer is highly accomodating. Second, the mission seemed quite pointless to me. Was that American woman so important that she needed rescuing? I think not! Thirdly, was this movie suppose to entertain or make one cry? I must say that this movie played on my emotions from the start. The scene of Africans hacking each other is just too brutal for me to handle. Finally, the whole plot strikes one as being absurd. The American Aristocracy (government) cares nothing about Africa as it stands. I would venture to say that the writers of this movie used a lot of imagination to come up with the plot. Know why? There is no precedent for such a mission in Africa. No wonder the story was so ridiculous! Oh well, I was entertained somewhat."
1,tears of boredom,"Maybe the ending saves this movie. I rarely only watch half a movie, but after about 45 minutes I had to stop this DVD. Incredibly cliche beginning, followed by scenes that left me wondering why it took 15 minutes to convey to the movie watcher something that could be summed up in about 15 seconds. Really, I just didn't get it."
5,WOW,"As you have probably learned already what this movie is all about from so many reviews - I have an urge to add that this movie SHOWS American's what they really are and that is CARING towards all other people with only one agenda in their minds.Helping the oppressed to make the world a better place.There are no coincidences! So, GO U.S.A., I am not surprised you're a superpower. The Good always WIN, no matter what."
3,It's no Hamburger Hill,"This movie is just silly! It stars Bruce Willis as a somewhat long-in-the-tooth Army Lieutenant whose mission is to rescue the (all too pretty for this part) Monica Belluci who plays the part of the heroic American doctor running the mission in war torn Nigeria.Naturally, she convinces Willis to also rescue her 70 Nigerian villagers. This movie is long on philosophical jungle conversations but short on emotional impact, until the last thirty minutes or so when violence substitutes for intelligence.It is truly jingoistic and could well have been named Die Hard four, or five, or six.........Good news for fans of the genre!To its credit, the scenics are remarkable, as is the reality of ethnic cleansing in war-torn Nigeria. In conclusion, if you have nothing better to do on a Sunday afternoon, rent it. Just know this is no Hamburger Hill, or Black Hawk down!"
2,DOA Near the End....,"Rent it when you've seen the better combat stories. Well I had high hopes for this one at the theater, and the first half was good enough. Then on the second half the whole ""reality"" of the movie fell through. If you ever read any real SEAL stories you will wonder what happened at the end. Bad tactics, bad acting, and just poor story. They all died about the start of the ""big battle"", somehow walking out in the B-movie end. Total science fiction. Sorry, that was just too much. And Why? No one to write a realistic script? Ran out of ideas? What a waste for the budget and huge effort. Thats my take. BlackHawk down Was a good movie though!"
2,Major Flaw,"I'll admit that this film was fairly intense. And it did have good acting from Bruce Willis and Eamonn Walker (Karim Said on HBO's ""OZ""). And it had some good action set-pieces. And it has a good premise. And it starred the almost disturbingly beautiful Monica Bellucci. But it has one central question that it does not answer ... soldiers Willis and Walker go in to the jungle to extract Dr. Bellucci, but the film never bothers to answer why they would be sent to do this. And this is the very first stone laid in the building of the story and because it is never answered, the entire effort fails to reach the heights that it should have. Is this on par with BLACK HAWK DOWN as Amazon sugests? Not by a long shot."
2,Too Sentimental,"Tears of the Sun just isn't my type of movie, but it's not all bad either. I'd rank it slightly above Black Hawk Down. Honestly, I was hoping for more action. This movie is rather slow paced with lots of ""emotion"" tossed in. It takes an otherwise entertaining action flick downhill, in my opinion.Things aren't all bad though. There's some great action mixed in between all the sappy parts, and nearly all the the actors playing the US soldiers give a great performance. The ironic thing is, most of the characters seem just as annoyed at the slow pace and sappy nature of it all as I did, which made it that much more tolerable.- Rirath_com"
5,A Great Rescue Movie,"This movie is about a group of Navy SEALs who are sent to Africa to rescue an American. But this mission doesn't come easy when there are rebels out to stop them and kill anyone in their path.This is a great film with lots of action, and shooting."
4,"Not Bad, Could of Been Better","Tears of the Sun was a pretty satisfiying war film. The action scenes were well done, but not eough action for my taste. I expected an action war film, but I didn't get it. Although it was a very compelling story. What I did get was a very modern and dramatic drama story. Very Nice."
2,Disappointing,"Although this movie has a great title, it unfortunately falls short. How many other movies have already been done just like this one? Did we really need this story line again? Totally predictable and quite boring, and non-original. Bruce is far from my fave actor, but in this he really stinks. Altogether a big disappointment."
1,the movie [was bad],"and the lead female actress (the doctor) was extremely irritating, whiny, and seemed totally unable to grasp how much danger she and her refugees were in and how much Bruce Willis had gone against direct orders for her. oh how I wanted him to just shoot HER and put ME out of my misery. ANd what was the storyline???? There was none... I am glad I did not waste even more money by seeing this in the theatre."
1,a waste of time of money,Tears of the sun is a waste of time and money. This was one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. I would not recommend this thing to my dog. Who cares about... africa. This is the same [stuff] that has been going on there for a 1000 yrs. To make a movie about it was a waste of time and money.
2,a so so film,"I'd say it was an ok movie, nothing to rave about. Monica Bellucci was a miss-fit, I didnt think she fit in at all as an American doctor helping poor Africans. Bruce Willis is always good. The action scene in the village was probably the best part. The last scene were not all that great at all, very ameaturish in my opinion. I found it really funny, that none of the Nigerian soldiers could shoot straight. Its ironic that all the people trying to do something good for the Africans were either Americans or Europeans, considering the fact that much of Africa's problems today could be attributed to European Colonization, or how everyone turned a blind-eye to what happened in Rwanda.If you want to watch a really good movie on this subject, then watch HOTEL RWANDA."
3,NOT ENOUGH TEARS!,"I would walk long distances to see Bruce Willis in action. However, in Sun he has toned down a bit and has let some of the supporting actors do most of the heavy stuff.Cole Hauser, Johnny Messner, Paul Frances, carry the load and do a good job. Tom Skirritt has a cameo.Monica Bellucci, is very real an is not afraid to have mud on her face. I understand she has a very hard to watch scene in 'IRRREVERSABLE,' a scene that has turned many heads, I will see it when I can.All in all an action flick with great cinematography,(Mauro Fiore) and good editing (Conrad Buff)I give it a 3/5ciao yaaah69"
4,one of the best,"This is one of the best modern warfare movies, even though it's been out for a few years now, somehow I just got around to seeing this film. It is one a the few movies to show the senseless plight of ethinic cleansing in Africa. It has fine perfomaces by the actors and some great action scenes. See it you won't be disappointed."
5,"Great movie, good story and full of action","In this movie, Bruce Willis is part of a Special Forces unit that is deployed into a war-torn part of Africa with instructions to certain extract US citizens that are working at a missionary. Willis and his team battle and evade a large force that is quickly tracking them throughout there journey to the extraction zone. Along the way they confront and eliminate a group of men that are carrying out their mission of ethnic cleansing. While this is nothing like the Die Hard series, this is still a very good movie in its own way and I am surprised at the number of negative reviews on this movie."
3,Good Film,"A navy seal lieutenant (Bruce Willis) assigned to rescue a relief doctor in Central Africa changes his orders to help rescue the refugees the doctor is residing over. It's a gritty, hard look into the genocide of villagers in Central Africa by Nigerian soldiers. It is very emotional and heart wrenching for the soldiers who are following their leader without, at first, understanding him. Once scene particular hit home for me of the viciousness of what is happening. They come across a village where a woman lays screaming and bleeding because her chest has been cleaved so she can't feed her children. I liked how this movie wasn't a showboat for Willis and he shared the stage with a talented group of often unrecognized actors like Cole Hauser, Eamonn Walker and Nick Chinlund. It you like this genre of films you'll enjoy this film. I will watch again."
1,fullscreenwarrior,All movies should come out in wide and full screen versions. My rateing for this movie is due to the wide screen version only. I am sure it is a great movie as Bruce Willis seems to do no wrong. He is one of the best!
2,TEARS OF THE MUNDANE,"THIS MOVIE IS SAPPY AND FORMULAIC. BRUCE WILLIS SHOULD HAVE SERVED IN IRAQ AS HE VOLUNTEERED TO DO....IM SURE THEY COULD USE A LATRINE OFFICER??GOOD CINEMATOGRAPHY, BAD SENTIMENTALITY...RENT THIS FILM DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE DVD."
1,not a fun movie to watch ...,"The characters are too self-righteous and naive. Doesn't make much sense to risk all these soldiers' life to save a volunteer doctor in Africa given she doesn't want to be rescued -- is her like more valuable than the soldiers' ?Almost everyone in the movie are filled with rage (for no reason) and no humor in life. The movie feels like European instead of Good ol' American.simply put, no fun whats so ever to watch this movie."
3,PREACHY ACTION = MIXED SATISFACTION,"An intense and yet not fully satisfying war movie, TEARS OF THE SUN didn't really connect at the box office on the eve of our invasion of Iraq. Bruce Willis and his platoon of Navy Seals are dropped into an African mission outpost to rescue Monica Belluci, an American national. Moncia has 70 persons in her mission who will be slaughtered if they are left behind. Willis disobeys orders, puts himself, his platoon and his charges at risk to do what he believes is the morally right thing. This is a powerful film that is message laden (it's aganist genocide, duh) but is often as harrowing and realistic as ""Black Hawk Down."" Recommended."
4,First half boring Second half great thats it,"I expected more i guess from the same guy who directed Training day and The Replacement Killers and it was advertised as the best war film since Black Hawk Down.I was wrong and so were they the first half of this movie i was ready to cut it off not becouse it was that bad but i was expecting black hawk down like advertised instead i almost fell asleep.Then the second half started with explosions and all that great stuff and was good from then on,what were they thinking for the first half! Definately not BHD but the production,acting,and second half of the movie earned it somewhere between 3.5 - 4.0 stars Rent it."
4,"A dissapointment, but still decent","I have to say that i expected more from Tears of the Sun. I figured it would be like Black Hawk Down. I didnt think there were enough action scenes, i mean i understand that the seals arent always caught in crossfire but i thought it moved slow and I also thought it was unlikely that the 8 Seals would save all those refugees. The last scene with the jets is the best. Overall a decent movie. Dissapointing though"
4,HUH?! A pro-USA movie from Hollywood?!,"How did this happen? A pro-US movie from the out-of-touch drones in Hollywood? Who would have expected it? This is a good movie where the bad guy isn't made to be a good guy and the good guys really are good guys. The movie is not without a couple of flaws (e.g. the whiny, ignorant, supporting actress), but it is fun to watch and overall a good ride. Good filming and good acting (for a movie of this genre). In these times of 2-bit, simpleton, terrorists trying to justify their murderous activities in the name of ""Allah"" and killing women and children for their ""god"", it is refreshing to see a movie from the side of the freedom loving, good guys....If you believe in individual liberty you will probably enjoy this movie, if you don't.....well, I can't help you."
4,Tears of the Sun - Blu-Ray Review,"I have the DVD and purchased this blu-ray because i really like this movie. The sound is better, but the image is not that great. The upconvertion DVD image is almost equal."
5,20 year old student,"This movie is amazing! I just spent six weeks in Nigeria and I wish I had watched it before I left, would have given me a better appreciation for the people, the country and what they've been through. Even though it was relatively peaceful while I was there I could see the affects of the hate between the muslims and the christians. Anyway....great movie, watch it, see what's happening in the world around you..."
4,Powerful film!!,"I never expected to be this moved by a Willis film. Exceptional, plus including the Lost Boys into this film shows how Willis and Antoine Fuqua put their heart and soul into the making of a film which we won't forget for a long while.Critics may be holding back on the kudos this film should be receiving because of their own politics, but the public is all in unison in their acclamation of 'Tears of The Sun'.It is graphic in nature so may not be suitable for young viewers; however children in other parts of the world live this first hand..it is their life. This film is reality but is filmed respectful to the sensitivity of the viewing audience."
4,Actually quite a good movie ...,"if you can overcome the liberal self serving moaning of the female lead of the movie as the Navy Seals enter the compound to advise her that revel soldiers are close with their objective to not only kill her but also the priest, nuns and patients in their jungle hospital .....From that point on this is a great action picture of Seals in what they do best. It's equisitely filmed with a great background story as the little group of hospital staff and helpers try to make it out of Nigeria ....A great action flick for a Sunday afternoon at home ...."
3,Not the Extended Directors Cut.,"Why bother to create a Blu-Ray version of this movie without making it the best version possible? The only version of this movie that should be shown is the Extended Directors Cut which is without a doubt the most powerful movie I have seen this past year. This Blu-Ray version is a gutted, weak, disjointed version.The technical aspects of the movie are top notch, that being the video and audio transfer."
5,Navy Seals,"A film that is thought provoking. A SEAL team commander is put in a moral dilemma, and must act outside the ""box"". SEAL fans should enjoy."
5,Just what I ordered,"Good movie, great plot and the picture is stunning, Bruce Willis never fails to perform up to his usual standards"
3,A Solid Movie,This film was entertaining and moved pretty quickly. Only a few slow spots. Not much character developement but a good action/war flick. Unfortunately like a lot of films of this genre it assumes that military officers constantly disobey orders and do as they feel. Willis is also a bit old for his rank (48 when the film was released) but he carries it off pretty well. If you don't think too hard while watching this you will enjoy it.
3,One-dimensional but...,"I really have quite ambivalent felings about this movie. From one hand, it's full of cliches and very simpleminded. You pretty much know what will happen, a lot of things are overdramatized (not the scenes of atrocities though). The acting is mediocre but it's not a problem of actors but rather of a bad script. On the other hand, the scenes of atrocities in the movie (somewhere in Africa - Sudan comes right away to mind) make people to realize that such terrible things are really happening today. It did really resonate through probably some shock - at least that's the way I feel. And who knows, maybe a simplemindness of this movie helps to deliver the message. I would give one star for cinematographic qualities and five stars for revealing the problem and showing disasters really happening in the world today."
4,Horrific African civil war portrayal,"Bruce Willis plays Lt. Waters, a hard core, taciturn and ambivalent commander of a U.S. Navy Seal unit assigned to extract American foreign nationals from war torn Nigeria. His mission is to escort an American doctor, played emotionally by Monica Bellucci, who is based in a remote jungle mission. Unfortunately she won't acccompany Willis' team without a group of 70 refugees sheltered at the mission.Willis in a fit of compassion and urged on by Bellucci agrees to escort the rag tag bunch to the safety of neighboring Cameroon. Willis' team and the refugees are being pursued by a murderous band of rebels bent on their destruction. While fleeing they are confronted by horrendous acts of nauseatingly gruesome ethnic cleansing, which bolsters their resolve to complete their mission.Director Antoine Fuqua poignantly creates an excessively graphic allegory portraying the inhuman capablities of man against those perceived as being different or inferior."
3,Great action...,"but a large dose of annoying. Doesn't the doctor know how to button her shirt. Her outfit detracts from her acting ability, if any. Stay for the action or her cleavage."
4,Action-packed war movie with love interest,"Very intertaining, suspenseful movie. Great acting (Bruce Willis is definitely in his element here) by both Monica Bellucci (who is absolutely gorgeous) and Willis. There are plenty of action sequences keeping you on the edge of your seat, without all the unnecessary gore. Take the time to see this one, it's definitely worth it!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE,"I rented this movie thinking it to be something kind of like Black Hawlk Down. I WAS DEEPLY DISAPOINTED. This movies is pointless and stupid. You know all the previews you see on tv for it, all that action. Ya well, its in the movie but its at the very end for about five minutes. All i can say is DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE, DONT EVEN RENT IT."
1,95% of the whole team wasted because of some idiot female doctor,The female doctor was SO ANNOYING. These Navy SEAL's show up to rescue her and 3 others and all she can do to show some thanks is bitch and moan and telling them to get their guns out of the village and to take over 70 people with them on a Helo that fits a normal infantry squad sized element. Stupid movie. She refused to leave said village and I wouldve left her there with all the trouble that it caused. I woulda told the CO that was thousands of miles away that she was WASTED already. Integrity isnt always the best option. By following her wishes almost the entire team and more than half the people they took along got wasted. Was it worth it? They shouldve just tranquilized her or left her there for dead like she wished. This movie SUCKS!
1,Tears for this bad attempt,"Nice start, a lot of typical over-dramatization and dragged out scenes, and a silly and predictable ending. The technical accuracy was lacking, with such things as handheld radios reaching miles inland and the whole idea of disobeying orders and putting the entire team at risk. Surely there had to be a better way of protecting those people. American ambassadors overseas aren't too keen on American military units formulating their own on-the-spot foreign policy. I would save your money for something a little less flashy and more accurate."
2,From a huge Bruce Willis fan...,"If this movie had been intended to be a spoof on war movies, then i thought it was hilarious. They used every cliche in the book. Are all African relief workers so attractive? Frankly, I am a big Bruce Willis fan, and, i will say, if he wasn't in it this would have been one of the worst movies ever. Instead, it is a movie that tries to copy ""Black Hawk Down"" but fails in every way. From a former member of the military, avoid this one and get ""Black Hawk Down"" instead. Tom Skerrit on the deck of an aircraft carrier with a sat Phone, that would never happen. Did they even consult with the military?"
2,Predictable Plot and Action,"I went into this movie with high expectations. However, I found the plot and the action sequences extremely predictable. This movie will require a very strong ""willful suspension of disbelief"" in order to buy some of the scenes, acting, and decisions made by the characters. Although some of the action scenes were noteworthy, the overall slow pace of the movie and overly dramatic scene choices from the director made me wish the fast forward button was a little closer on the remote."
2,Not what i expected...,"When i saw the previews for Tears of the Sun, i was like SWEET, GOTTA SEE IT!!!! when i viewed it last night, i was very dissapointed. On the commercial of course they show the big action scenes and all that stuff, but in the movie, there is no action until the very end. There is some small action earlier but not enough to please me. I am a die hard action film fan, and this just doesnt reach the standards. i thought the movie would be about the Navy SEALS trying to survive, but really it was about rescueing (forgot how to spell) a prince from a war torn african country. i was like ""WTF!!"" i thought this was going to be like ""Black Hawk Down"" or ""Die Hard"". but unfortunatly it isnt. if you like big time action movies like the two listed above, dont buy or rent this movie. if you like corny ""save this person"" kind of movies, this might be just for you. oh well. now i have to break the news to my friend that the movie stunk big time.....-patrick (im unhappy)"
2,Its a rental,Yep!Its another rental! Go and rent this movie when it comes out on DVD!I would say wait for the chance to do so. I was shocked! It was like watching an action chick flick. I was dissapointed in Mr. Willis. He is beginning to loose his touch. This review is for those who read short reviews and look at the low star ones first.This movie is too controversal and does not have the potential to be a great movie at all. It is moraly right and actionfully wrong! Wait and rent it later.
2,What the hell?,"How are we supposed to feel at the end of this movie? Good, that the Nigerian patients survived? I don't think so. The most important aspect of this story is really quite simple: Lt. Waters disobeyed direct orders and sacrificed the lives of four SeALS. More than $5,000,000 in assets lost because his character had an emotional crisis? That's a steep price to pay. In the really real world, a deserved court martial would be awaiting Lt. Waters upon his return home. Besides all of this, the military tactics, or lack thereof, in this movie must have been 'developed' by a blind monkey. JoJo the Idiot Circus Boy must have been the military consultant. I can only hope that a sequel is made, with the end result being Lt. Waters hanging from a yard arm!"
5,Knut and Friends,My 4 year old and 1 1/2 year old just loved Knut. It is a very nice story/documentary of raising Knut and it also follows a couple of other bears in the wild dealing with life. Definitely family friendly for all ages.
5,polar bear dvd,i loved knut and friends dvd because i love all the bears in it. i love animalvideos.
5,Great Movie,Everyone Kid to Adult should watch this movie. It is awesome and eye opening. You will love all that people do to help these bears. The story is amazing and the photography is WOW WOW
2,Good Song But...,"I'm not ragging on Manson or anything, but just get Smells like Children and the Lunchbox Single instead. All these songs and more can be found on those EPs. If you just want Sweet Dreams, just download it. This single isn't worth your money because there isn't anything new on it that can't be found elsewhere. Great music but utterly pointless.1. Sweet Dreams (Are made of These) - Smells like Children2. Dance of the Dope Hats (Remix) - Smells like Children3. Down in the Park - Lunchbox4. Next Motherf****r (Remix) - Lunchbox"
2,Arthur Avenue Cookbook,"I was very disappointed in this cook book. It had some great pictures , some not so great , but most of all the recipes were not what I was looking for. They were not what I call ""Real Italian Grandma recipes"". I was sorry I bought the book."
5,great cookbook,"This is a excellent cookbook....I went to the restaurant in the Bronx recently and met the chef, owners, and all the wonderful people involved in this restaurant. I had to get the book and it did not disappoint!...."
5,What is a Ponzi Scheme?,I really enjoyed this movie. I understand now what a Fiat currency is. Gold and silver is king. Nothing could ever replace this. The US Government is head for a disaster and so is the rest of the world.
3,Children of the Future,"This is Steve Miller's first album (except for a single with Barry Goldberg). He was at a psychedelic stage in his career which over the next two albums (Sailor and Space Cowboy) moved in the direction of a more commercial music. Its good but I would not consider it a ""must buy"", but demonstrates his musical skills and creativity for fans of his later albums."
5,Excellent,"Was given this album as a gift many years ago. it is since long gone, but the memories lasted. Glad to find on CD. It is a great rock/new age/space music/experimental early work by the soon to become ""the joker""!"
5,Steve and Boz in a blues band with great vocals and guitar,"Released just after the 1st big Pop Fest. in Monterey,Cal.,this is a recording that has stood up well in the fast changing pop music world. Only the ""psychedelic"" cover and the title track give the listner a clue that this is not a record of the 90's. A pre-Joker Steve Miller shows some raw and moving guitar and even harmonica chops. Steve's guitar licks and vocal arrangements are unique to this one album.Also featuring an unknown Boz Scagg,the song selection and talented presentation will keep you from ever being bored. Or suspecting... this is a really good and well disguised blues band by talent that has proved itself for +/- 30yrs"
1,Not Good,"Surprised he got a second album after this turkey. Sailor is a little better. Very indulgent, you never start with your Sgt. Pepper, can't understand who he thought he was on this debut album. Pesky sound effects, 2 minute buildups to dissappointing songs. A little off key in places."
4,Cool Book,"I have read every single one of Tamora's books, and this book was awsome. You meet new characters and suprises, and I really like that. Daine's Wild Magic is awsome, and I loved this book. But the only thing that made me not give it 5 stars was the fact that Alanna kinda hogged the book in my opinion. I mean, her quartet is over, she can go live her life, let Daine get her own chance!! But its a good book and a good start for a good quartet. And if you like this read Circle of Magic, Tamora's newest quartet."
5,I've been searching for the perfect series and here it is!!!,This book is beyond words the best book I have ever read in my life!!!! It is my first Tamora Pierce book and I garantee it's not the last!!!! I didn't find one paragragh to be boring! My only regret is not having found this sooner!!!!
1,The most confusing book!,I hated this book! I wouldn't recomend it at all! It is very confusing and doesn't keep your attention. I had to read it for school so I got through it! I wouldn't read the rest of the series either!
5,Probably my favorite book,"This is one of the few books I never tire of reading. Ever since my mother took it out of the library it has been a favorite of mine. I did eventually buy my own copy. This is a wonderful coming of age story, filled with adventure, magic, and friendship. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good fantasy romp. Diane is probably one of my favorite characters of all time (along with Alanna the Lioness); the girl's got spunk. Don't take it from me that this book is great, read it yourself. It has to have something special to get so many great reviews."
5,Magical Entry,"This story attaches you to the rest of the books. Once you open the book you don't want to stop reading. Like all books that are first in a series, this book tells you about the people,and the places. The Magic in the book is just as amasing as the detail and description. As soon as you stat reading you won't want to stop!"
5,Best book ever!!!!!!!,"Tamora Pierce hads done it again. As soon as i started reading Wild Magic, I couldn't put it down. This book takes fantasy to a new level and if you think fantasy is too corny then you have never read this book. In this book, a girl named Daine is a runaway from home when banditts set on fire her home. She then meets Onua who is a mage seeking someone who will help her bring some horses to the Queen of Tortall's camp for riders. On their way there, Daine and Onua encounter creaters that are not normal. The blood thirsty creaters are Imortals that have escaped from the divine realms where they have been prisoned for four hundred years. She then finds out that her knack with animals is more then a knack, its Wild Magic. She becomes a student of a mage named Numair and under his guidence, she explores her magic. Trust me, this is not a book that you want to pass by. Once you read it you won't want to put it down."
5,What a book!,"Wild Magic is a fabulous story. You become so familiar with Daine, you feel like she is your sister.The book has a seemingly magical essence that draws you in. If you like animals, fantasy, and a good book, you will enjoy this story."
4,fasinating,"the begining was a little boring which made me not want to read it but i made a choice to continue and that was a good choice. even though the begining i a litte rough,it smoothens out as the story progresses. cant wait to read rest of the series"
5,Absolutely Splendid,"I would recommend this book to anyone who loves animals. the wonderful Daine is a splendid character that can relate to almost any teenager who has a passion for animals. Tamora has created yet another legend in Tortall - who, hopefully, will not be the last - she has included all great characters like the Lioness, King Johnathon, Queen Thayet, and of course, George- the King of Theives. This story is uplifting and full of adventure and excitment. If you start reading this book, you will get hooked, I garuntee it! In my opinion, the Immortals series is the best of Tamora's pieces..though the Lioness Quartet was very original, this series has a more modern feel and shows her love of animals. So, if you are considering reading this book then I urge you to hurry up and order it! Don't hesitate, this book is worth it- you will see....."
5,Wolf-Speaker,"The book, Wolf-Speaker is an awsome book. There are some really great parts involing; wolves, dragons, basilisks, stormwing, hurroks, and more. If you like myth, animals and adventure, this is your type of book. You will never want to put it down. The story is about young Daine learning how to use her magic and helping humans, immortals and animals of all sorts. If you have read The Song Of The Lioness series, this will suit you also. It even has a little of Alanna and Roald in it! Well this is a great book and I say you should try it. From, Kitten The Dragon"
3,Kindle version filled with typos,"I give the story 4 stars, but the Kindle version of the book gets 1 star. The book was interesting enough, but the text was filled with typos that sometimes made understanding the book difficult. It is almost as if they used OCR on the text and didn't bother to proof it. I expect much more from a text than this."
5,A great beginning for a magical tale!,"I am a huge fan of Tamora Pierce, and even though I'm a senior in high school, I still devour her books.The book begins the tale of a young girl, Daine, who has an uncanny relationship with animals. For fans of fantasy and animals, the book is a must.The Daine series is both imaginative and fun! I began my journey into the world of Tamora Pierce with this book, and I am forever hooked. I just recently reread this book, and loved it just as much as I did a few years ago.While this series doesn't necessarily require too much background, I recommend starting with the Alanna series. And wait, there's more: The Protector of the Small series. In my opinion, this is the best of the Tortall novels."
5,It opens your eyes and lets you imagen.,"This book lets you escape from the world you live in to a different and more exciting one, the characters become part of you as you read more in to it. They are done so well and come from the heart, thats it's hard not to love this book. The detail that has been put in it lets you picture what the places and people are really like. This is are great book and any one who read it would see this to, and love it as much as I do."
5,Wild Magic,"I read Wild Magic and loved it. It has more depth than Harry Potter, but it is an easier read than Lord of the Rings. It has the cultural diversity of Redwall, but it includes humans. Daine, is the main character, who can talk to animals including the fantastically fictional animals that inhabit her world. It gets interesting when she must use these powers to win a war against an army of dark wizards. I thought I had read all the good fiction/fantasy books, but this surpassed all expectations. I highly recommend this book."
5,The Best!,"I just loved this book! I must have read this a million times! It's not just a kid book either. There's all kinds of ""grown up"" things in there. I really liked the way Tamora Pierce kept former charcters in the book, King Jonathon, Alanna, George etc. I had been wondering what would happen to them and now I know! This book just sets the scene for the rest of the three books following it.Daine is a typical young girl and I feel like I can relate to her dispite her slight unordinaryness (is that a word?) namely talking to animals.This is a great book, if you didn't like it, you must not have really read it, because everyone who reads this HAS to like it!"
5,~da best~,"This book is probably the best series out of all the other books by tamora pierce i have read... It's wild and once you start reading, you will never want to put the book down! the book is full of action like the stormwings etc as well as love, passion and the care she gives for the animals.you should really read this!"
5,Immortals series,"i started reading these books when i was 12, i'm now 18 years old and i still read her books. i've read all of them at least 10 times. she is one of my favorite authors. she is an author who is able to keep the attention of a reader for a lifetime. with action, romance, magic. the best fantasy books i've ever read. any of her books would be great and if you haven't read one of them i suggest it!"
5,Classically Timeless,This story is classically timeless I relay enjoy it and have read it more then once I am scythed about the new paper back cover art and I am among the younger pools of readers when I first picked this book up cause my mom told me about it ...Forever more I have been hooked on tamora pierce while I may not agree with some of her writing I will say she gives female characters a strong voice and is sure to leave an impression this book is worth your time
1,Such a disappointment!,"I don't even have the heart to write a decent review, and believe me when I say I'm hurting inside---this was my first Tamora Pierce book and I had such high expectations, but the poor darlings came all tumbling down as the story progressed. I just couldn't get into it. It's... it's all over the place, to the point that I had no idea whatsoever of what, who, when, where... I just---I just---it's not for me."
4,A definite page turner,"I think this book was one of the best in the series. I loved how the characters from Song of the Lioness played their roles again in the Immortals. It was almost like Tamora Pierce was saying ""Don't think I forgot these guys!"" Out of the entire Immortals series, this is my 2nd fave (first fave is the 4th book, The Realms of the Gods) This book is action-packed and doesn't have any slow-moving parts that make you want to skip ahead. You'll wanna read every word ten thousand times again!"
2,"Dragons should lay eggs, not give birth","Eh, maybe it's because I haven't read any other of this author's books and started out with this one first, but the book was mediocre at best. Good idea, but insipid prose, nice, bland, boring characters, and towards the end she starts throwing in random griffins, dragons, and even a kraken almost as an afterthough/deus ex machina plot device.But what really annoyed me was the dragon ""in labor"" toward the end of the book. Don't dragons typically hatch from eggs? I've never heard of one giving birth before, and the bit where the main character heals the dragon fetus in utero is just silly, not to mention that they're planning to feed it milk at the end. Who feeds a dragon MILK? Or any reptile, for that matter?"
5,Like all of Ms.Pierce's books (both quartets) it was GREAT!,"It's a new beginning for Daine, and a new thrill for all of Alanna's fans as she makes appearances in this new book, first of a new series also set in Tortall. For all who loved the story of a firey young woman determined to becaome a knight against all odds, comes Daine, a mysterious girl blessed with a strange power called Wild Magic. With new friends to guide her, she slowly makes her home in Tortall, and tells the story of her past and an unknown father. Filled with raids and fights and touching scenes, Pierce slowly helps us let go of Alanna, although she is still with us and Daine, and introduces a sparkling new character, and brand new gem in the crown of Tortall."
5,She's done it again!!! =D,"I adore this series, just like I did the Song of the Lioness. I hope Tamora Pierce writes many more books about Tortall and its inhabitants. One thing, though: it is really interesting how different a character can seem depending on whether they are the main character or just a minor one. My view of Alanna changed from her series to this one. Anyhoo, I loved the story, and enjoyed seeing how all of the friends from the Lioness series ended up years later. --A must-read!!!"
5,Great Book!,"This book was great! I absolutly adored it. By the way DO NOT READ THIS SERIES BEFORE THE ALANNA SERIES. One of my friends did that and it spoiled it for him. I love the way Daine meet Numair, it was so cool! Ms. Pierce, keep up the great work on future series!"
5,Amazing!,"I love this book! Mum gave them to me to look at at lunch time, and so I brought them all and I stayed up late to finish them! I spent every spare minute reading thisone, then the next, the next, and I'm onto the fourth on day 3! I couldn't put it down. I've read her first two Circle of Magic books, and these are just as good if not better! Tamora Pierce is definitly my favourite author."
5,Awesome!!!!!!,"When my mom handed me the book, I thought, Is it really worthmy time? I started it to please her, and I ended up pleasing myselfbeyond all limits. To prove my last statement I immediatly went out and bought the rest of the series, including the Song of the Lioness series, and used up nearly all of birthday money. About the book. Well, you've got Daine, a teenage girl with a mare pony, Cloud for a family. She joins up with Onua, the royal horsemistress, and a very tall mage, Numair. In Tortall she finds work, and lots of adventures, from griffins to a kraken to a queen who 'runs around dressed like real people'. One of Tamara's best!"
5,Love Fantasy? Then You'll Love This!,"This is an amazing book! If you love fantasy, you have got to read Tamora Pierce! This is the first book of her second quartet. The main chracter is Daine, a 13-year-old girl who has a knack with animals. She meets a woman called Onua and becomes her helper to lead a bunch of ponies to the wonderful country Tortall...and to find out the rest you'll just have to read it! Wild Magic is also extremely well-written! After reading it, I'm sure you'll read the rest of the quartet - plus all of Tamora Pierce's other equally enjoyable books!"
5,the defining work of fantasy literature,"Even now, at age 13, riffling through the well worn pages of my beloved Immortals series, I wonder how it is humanly possible to write books so amazing. I've always loved fantasy, and Tamora Pierce is my favorite author, and always has been. This entire series is a must read for any fantasy nut. It's just like a good smoothie - the perfect blend of everything. Humor, adventure, a touch of romance and a whole lot of enchantment, I consider the Wild magic story one of Ms.Pierce's finest. The young girl Daine, who has the wonderful gift of animal speech, and even shape shifting, starts out as a sad orphan who's lost her family.It was wonderfull to ""watch"" her slowly heal, and discover herself shinig through her past. But I really felt myself connect with all the characters, and I consider that one of the most important things about novels. I recommend this book for anyone who likes a good fantasy."
5,Wild Magic,"This is a wonderful book!!! It is about a girl with magical power with animals. She can speak to them and they can speak back. I think that this has been a dream of many different people. It's also about the triumph of the human spirit. I don't want to give anything away, but the main character is suffering from a past tradegy. While Daine recovers and discovers her newfound home is being besieged by unimaginable monsters. A truly wonderful action-packed book. (if you liked this one, you will love the other three)"
5,Stunning!,"I loved this book! It is one of my absolute favorite Tamora Pierce books, and I've read them all (except the three newest ones). It is a great start to a great quartet. Daine, Onua, Numair, Alanna, and all the other characters are shown with such detail, you think they wrote this book themselves. Which they did, in a way. If you loved The Song of the Lioness Quartet, you'll love this book (and the ones after it)."
3,Solid Story But Distant Characters,"I have always been a major fan of the Justice League, so I always look forward to the release of any new production. ""Justice League Doom"" has a solid story line, good animation (although the body styles were more androgynous and less exaggerated - Superman less cut, Wonder Woman less curvy), and the same excellent voice cast from the animated series (there are also cameos by Bruce Timm and Andrea Romano.)The thing that I felt was missing from this story was the sense of real camaraderie that we saw in the series. This story involved a lot of very powerful individuals who happened to know each other, but I did not get a strong sense that they really cared about each other until about the last minute or two of the film.Still, an engaging film and a very high-stakes situation to deal with; overall quite watchable."
2,Should have been way... better.,"This movie starts out GreaT. The idea of the Justice League beening under attack by plans that Batman devised is awesome. What sucks about the movie is, it felt like a long tv episode geared at little children only. The Justice League over come their problems without any consequences. At the end, it feels as if they were never attacked with Batman's contingency plan. So many great scenes could have been added to this movie, because of it's premise."
3,not a SPECIAL EDITION,"This was not worth the wait, there is nothing special about this edition...the movie is great as expected but disc number two contains 2 aditionl episodes of Wild Cards that we've all seen on JLU, it also contains the story of Dwayne McDuffe ..... the man was a genius and all that but they didn't have to sell that to me in a special edition .... its maybe 40 mins long or perhaps 30 but its sad from beginning to end.....and I passed out several times so it did feel like an hour. If they really wanted to honor the guy they should have place that video online for free for all to see.skip this purchase and just buy the regular version... save tour money."
5,should of been called :batboy saves erbody again,Yeah batman proves he is the one with the brain. While superman has the strength... Great story. not too long either. I've watch this movie about 5 times within a month. I think the kids would love it and adults wouldn't mind watching it
4,def worth watching,"got this about a week after it came out. I was planning on sitting down to watch it over the weekend but got home from a game early and popped it in for what I expected to be 15, 20 mins. wound up going to bed late because I stayed up to watch the whole stupid thing. I didn't want to turn it off. I know some people have complained it's only part of the tower of babel, blah blah blah. as someone that grew up on old school comics and doesn't read any of the new crap, I greatly enjoyed it. I'm not going to nitpick at things that seemed off but sit down and enjoy. it's not that awful live action comic or whatever it's called art. things flow, decent art, good story. haven't had time to watch the special features or 2nd disc but looking forward to the weekend when I have that kind of time.the biggest con of the movie was I would have preferred it to be longer. it really does fly by and got to the end was a little disappointed it was over already."
3,Felt Rushed,"is a solid story but felt rushed not polished if that makes any sense. Like a TV movie, not that this would be a bad thing specially with animation but it just felt generic."
1,"Great Movie, Horrible digital copy","There are plenty of people who have talked about how great this movie is and I agree. I just want to point out that the Ultraviolet/Flixster model of delivering digital copies is absolutely HORRIBLE. You have to create a Flixter account then an Ultraviolet account and then download a copy of their desktop software. The install for the desktop software is also Horrible. You need to download around 50 MB of data just to get the install and the install starts out telling you that it's getting around 16 MB, then when it reaches that, it says it is getting more and then more again. And even after that, you still can only stream the movie.I wasted about an hour doing all this and then cancelled my account(s). It appears you have to cancel both accounts separately.Won't be doing that again. Pitiful, pitiful, pitiful."
5,That old O'JAYS song comes to mind......,"...you know, their hit, BACKSTABBERS? Yeah, that one. But was it a real betrayal, or one of security and safety that no one but Batman could possibly foresee? Wouldn't it have been easier to just inform the rest of the League instead of creating dosiers on how to defeat them behind their backs? These were the questions that were racing thru my mind while I was watching this, and the truth is (if you can find a truth in an animated feature) that there was no clear cut truth to it. Sure Batman could have gone the more honest route and informed them, but if one of them do go rogue....well, like I said, it's not an easy call to make. That's why I loved this movie! Real life isn't always clear cut, so why should animated life get a pass?"
2,Rental at best...,"I wish I could be leaving a glowing review but, there really isn't much to say. The artistic styling isn't the best. The characters are pretty ugly actually. The story wasn't very compelling either. As I couldn't care less what happened at the end either way.Music score was near non existent. The only redeeming quality was the voice casting.If you're like me and loved some of WB's previous works like ""Superman:the animated series"" and ""Justice League Unlimited"" you've probably bought most of the animated features WB/DC has produced since. You've might have noticed, as I have, the decline in quality too. Well, this feature follows that same declining path. I'm finally getting fed up with being let down by WB's. That's why I'm recommending this as a RENTAL first."
2,Say no to UV format,Movie is OK - borrowed it rather than bought it due to the UV format that is not worth it. Hopefully DC will dump it for the next movie or I think there will be more who just leave it on the shelf.
2,"Interesting story, flat acting, laws of physics broken","The story has a great amount of promise, and to a degree it delivers on it, but the acting falls flat and so do some of the events. There is one point near the end where the heros can see something in space travelling towards them at the speed of light, thereby making the light from said travelling phenomena travel faster than the speed of light. It kind of irritated me. It was mostly the flat acting and bad lines that got to me though."
2,"When in doubt, fight it out!","Repetitive is the best way to describe this animated feature. The original story was an important one in the history of the Justice League due to the fact it really magnified the split that exists between the purely human heroes and the superheroes of the DC Universe. It portrayed Batman at his most paranoid and also his most vulnerable,but much of those original subtleties are lost here. It is now like the more recent DC releases, punching and zapping one another are the order of the day and any real thought or desire to push the envelope in the world of animated storytelling are abandoned. These are now nothing more than glorified Saturday morning cartoons and as such cannot be recommended."
2,Not worth it!,"I thought this movie would be as good as the movie, Batman and the Redhood, but it wasn't even close. This movie could had just been a regular episode of the JLA TV series.This movie failed to keep my attention many times. I just couldn't get into it. It seemed too well scripted to the point, you know the JLA will just find a easy way to fix all the stuff that is happing to them. Then, it happened. Every member of the JLA that had fallen to the Evil bad guys, came back very easily...too easily. Why? Because a non-JTL good guy was in the mix from the start had the solution all along.Half way though the movie, I pretty much wanted this movie to end. It was so boring to watch. After the half way point. I already knew that the JLA will just go find the evil team of super villains and take them out with ease. Which was exactly what happened.People should just not rent this one and not even close to a buy."
4,An alright movie,"The movie's pretty good, up until the ending, I felt that it was a bit corny and played out. I would rent this, but I wouldn't buy it."
2,Great DC Animated Movie....HATE UV Digital Copy,"The movie is a great addition to the DC Animated Collection. In fact I would rate the movie itself at 4 stars. I give it 2 stars for the fact that when I buy movies with a digital copy, I would like a digital copy...Not the UV stuff they claim is a digital copy. I love the iTunes Digital copies because I can store the movie locally on my device and watch it on my computer or iDevice with no problems. But, with the UV stuff you have to be connected to the internet and cant store them locally. I want my iTunes Digital copy back or there is no reason for me to pay extra for digital copy I will not ever use."
1,Mediocre,"The one-star rating is because justice league doom is simply not worth buying.No better or worse than a standard justice league tv episode.If Warner's wants to continue the show through DVD releases then they should use the familiar animation style along with the regular voice actors.Aside from red hood and I suppose crisis on two earths, the dc Warner's direct to DVD releases have been mediocre, uninspired, and honestly somewhat boring.The whole pg-13 thing just makes these projects too heavy and somewhat depressing and needlessly violent to justify the rating.The fact the brave & bold and young justice were/are so entertaining seems to prove that dc characters fare best with an ongoing series, where a 75 minute cartoon or even a 2 hour live action film just doesn't serve them well ( Nolan batman movies excluded)."
1,"Very, very underwhelming","This was the DCAU's version of Mark Waid's STELLAR storyline ""Tower of Babel"". Tower of Babel involves a villain team using Batman's protocols for defeating the JLA against the team. It's a BRILLIANT idea. It setup years worth of stories, eventually culminating in Infinite Crisis. The whole point of the story was to create tension in the team. Batman was right to create back-up plans to defeat his fellow leaguers... But they should've talked about it. The result was a long standing air of distrust amongst a team of the World's most powerful superbeings.This movie, ""Doom"", took the central aspect of the storyline it was based on... and resolved the problem in 5 minutes. The rest of the movie was a by-the-numbers hero team vs. villain team. It SUCKED. I expect much, much more from this studio."
4,This Was Enjoyable,"Though not the absolute greatest animated superhero movie out there, I thought Doom was pretty enjoyable to sit through. The voice acting was great, the animation was good, and the premis was pretty awesome. No matter what, the Justice League always seems to find a way to beat the odds, though much of it, as is evident in this as well, is Batman's cunning & ability to figure stuff out because he's a bad@$$ detective like that. All in all though, if you're a comic book movie fan, this one is definitely worth a viewing."
3,"Nice animation, dull story","While the animation is very nice (especially nice to look at on blu ray), the story kinda gets boring. I lost interest half way through. I wish DC would adapt more popular storylines like Hush, Knightfall, etcIf you can catch this at $10 and you're a comic fan I totally recommend it. But don't buy this movie at full price."
3,Doomed,"This movie was just OK, nothing close to the previous DC releases - good for a rental (which is what I did via Amazon.com) but not for a purchase."
5,Action Packed and Worth Watching,"I enjoyed it enough to watch it twice so far and I've had it a month. I am not going to spoil anything however I do question some of Batman's intentions. He says his methods were to incapacitate and not harm and the methods used by someone else have twisted them into devices for killing, yet I don't see how two of them could be used any other way. I may be missing something but it doesn't really matter much. What matters is that it is action packed entertainment, no slow spots, captivating from beginning to end."
5,Out of this World!!,"I did not know what to really expect when I purchsed this DVD. What I got was more than I bargained for- and am I ever grateful!! Justice League - Doom was much more than the title entailed. It paid distinct homage to the old Justice League series (the Hall of Doom, Cheetah, etc.) but Vandal Savage was no Lex Luthor- he was worse. Lex only wanted world domination- Vandal Savage wanted world annihilation!! There are twists and turns everywhere you look - not a dull moment. I would highly recommend this DVD for anyone who is a DC fan or just a Justice League fan.Dwayne McDuffie - YOU THE MAN!!!"
3,Good Enough,"I like these straight to DVD flicks without the ''rules'' of Saturday morning TV regarding violence, language and the like. If there were more, Id watch one daily! This was great, but it was good...... with a pretty solid twist that made the movie"
4,Should have reviewed earlier,I cant remember anything about this. Should have reviewed when I watched. In my experience I have loved all of the DC animated movies. Much better then the live action. I can only assume great movie.
5,Best in a decade?,"In a series of videos based on important comic story lines, this one stands out. What I like about this is each character was depicted accurately showcasing his or her strengths and weaknesses. The story was a solid one back when it was first printed, and the writers did a good job transferring it to the screen. The director did a good job taking the audience through the action scenes and plot points, and it was nice to have the voice talents back from the 90's animated series.I also really enjoyed the character design. The stylization was just enough the make the drawings more handsome.This movie and JLA: The New Frontier are my 2 favorite DC releases over the last 12 years."
4,Typical Batman,"Why did it surprise the JL that Batman had contingency plans? Batman always has a plan in case something goes wrong, and he has a backup plan for his backup plans.I liked the Hall of Doom, to bad they didn't have Luthor in his purple suit standing up there giving everyone orders."
