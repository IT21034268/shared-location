5,At Last!,"Finally, a toy that keeps our Lab occupied for more that 10 seconds and that she can't chew up, at least as yet. Our lab, Fiona, is an aggressive chewer when it comes to toys. We've tried quite a few ""tough"" interactive toys only to have her either figure it out in no time or just get to the heart of the matter and chew her way through to the treats. This is not a complex toy compared to others. However, even though she has tried numerous strategies to get at the treats, this ball makes her work for it keeping her occupied."
3,SO SO BALL,"It is very well made. Great size for whatever size dog u have. But finding the right size treats to put in it isn't as easy as I thought. Too small and they fall right out... too big, well, it gets stuck. I saw this on IT'S ME OR THE DOG to have when ur dog has separation issues... keeping them busy while ur gone and they get to treat themselves. My dogs just had No interest in playing with it.... I understand the entire concept but I don't think they read the instructions."
5,Happy Dog....Happy Owner,"I stumbled across this toy while shopping for pet supplies. Well, the Lab loves it so much we have since purchased 6 of them. No..... she's not destroying them, she loses them in the water. She carries it everywhere she goes. It's easy to fill with treats and she noses it around on the back porch keeping herself occupied. It will take just about any treat, you're not limited to a certain type of treat. It's such a success that I have purchased a smaller version for my Yorkie!"
2,Not durable,"So this toy looked like it had a lot of potential but my little dog chewed it to bits the second time I gave it to her. She isn't particularly rough on her toys either. Most of her stuff lasts a while. Also, it says ""hours of fun"" but she could get all her treats out in a matter of minutes. Save your money, buy a kong or something similar."
2,"Again, not a toy for heavy chewers.","Yup, the other reviews about heavy chewers are correct. If your dog regularly chews through most toys, they may make quick work of the Tricky Treat Ball if left unsupervised. I left my 8 month old pit/hound alone with it for less than 5 minutes and she found an unfortunately fast solution for getting to the treats: chewing a hole through to the bottom."
3,"Healthy distraction, 3 1/2",My 2 year old Boxer noses his Tricky Treat Ball all over the house. He isn't the brightest bulb but immediately understood how to work the ball to make treats come out after being shown how the first time. Now it's like watching dog soccer as he works to get his dinner. This is especially great for days when he is being a pain in the butt and I need to keep him busy for a while to give myself a moment of peace and quiet or when it is too cold or rainy for him to get enough outdoor play. He is also a food gulper so this forces him to only eat a few bits of kibble at a time. We have owned this toy a few months now and it is still in great condition. The last piece or two are too hard to get out even I can't get them out and washing fills it with water that won't come out.
2,"Entertaining, but it didn't last long","The good news is that my 11 month old, 15 lb. puppy loved it. However, he managed to chew off a chunk of the plastic in roughly five hours of supervised on-again, off-again play. So I had to throw it in the trash on the same day that it arrived - how disappointing."
2,Chewed right through,It lasted just over an hour from delivery to having the entire bottom chewed to pieces.Cannot recommend this product as the material is far too soft and easy to destroy.It would be great if it were made from a better quality rubber (like kong toys).
2,NOT for serious chewers,I loved the concept of this. Anything to keep my Lab busy for awhile. Unfortunately within 15 min my dog had chewed through the ball to get the treats. I wish the ball was made of sturdier plastic or hard rubber. I guess that's what I get for ten bucks. Wish it would have worked for me.
5,Siberian puppy loves it,"It took her awhile to figure it out, but once she did, she was hooked. She will roll the thing around until every last treat/kibble piece is eaten. Good way to keep a new puppy busy while doing some chores."
4,A huge hit,"I've had these balls for years. Every once in awhile one goes missing under a bed or something and I definitely need to replace it ASAP! My dogs get these every morning when I leave for work with 1/2 of their breakfast in it. I've had the harder, cube versions but they can be a bit hard on the cabinets. These are soft, don't hurt the walls or furniture and as long as you don't get them wet they are truly perfect. Because of the bend at the hole and the dimples in the ball it can take quite awhile to dry if submerged in water."
2,Not easily cleaned & strong chemical odor,"Before even opening the packaging, I could smell the stench of chemical off this toy. Dogs having 40x the smell sense of humans, I cannot imagine the assault on their noses. It may likely even cause the treats placed inside to have an altered taste as well.The design of the ball is one solid peice of soft plastic. You cannot take it apart for cleaning; if simply rinsing out with water and soap, good luck getting all of the water out. You have to wait for it to dry completely before using. And since it can't be cleaned, you're stuck using hard, crunchy treats as anything else is certain to spoil or contaminate the inside.Good in theory, but design poorly executed and seemingly low quality materials used to produce(made in China!)"
1,NOT for strong chewers,My 20 lb miniature pincher ate through this toy in 10 minutes. Do not get this for a dog who likes to chew. I've had much better luck with the hard plastic food puzzle toys. The ball itself is soft and doesn't make noise when it rolls-- might be fine for a different kind of dog.
1,Great....If you like you like cleaning up poo with orange chunks,"At first the pair I got for my dogs (got 2 balls) looked like a toy they enjoyed....then the next day they became toys I didn't enjoy - instead of nudging the ball to get the treats out, one of them found out it was easier to just chew a hole through them and stick his head in to get the goods out. End of the day. I have 2 balls with large chewed out holes and a dog pooping out orange plastic....."
1,Not even for small dogs,"My Shih-Tsu mix chewed a hole into it in less than 30 minutes. Yes I bought the small size, but I really thought it could withstand the chewing of a small dog.... Would not recommend this to anyone. It is not made for any dog."
1,did not last,"took less than 5 minutes for my dog to just chew up the ball rather than try to work it out. Also very tricky - needs a lot of treats in it to make the toy work properly for the dog. She just didn't find it enough fun to try to figure this one - and with a long list of tricks and recognized phrases, shes a smart dog."
2,"Too easy, not durable, not for big dogs","I bought a case of 12 only to find that my dogs can destroy this thing in 5 minutes flat. I placed dry food inside, which came out relatively easily as it rolled - however my 3 labs are very adept at these kinds of toys. After it was empty, they each easily tore through the plastic to look inside. Not fun... On a plus side, the orange plastic is easy to spot to clean up. Unfortunately, this ball proved too big for my mother's small dog - which leaves me to wonder - what's the perfect dog for this thing? However, we really like the soft feature, which is nice for inside non-carpeted play. A medium sized dog that is not an aggressive chewer would be the perfect candidate for this toy. For aggressive chewers or sharp-teeth puppies the Buster Food Cube is a better choice and comes in multiple sizes."
4,"Great little toy, with some limitations","Pros:- keeps my dog busy, he really likes it, after taking a while to realize what the whole concept is (and the smell of vinyl having worn off a bit)- easy to fill with little solid treats- up to now, hasnt been torn up.. and my dog rips apart everything..Cons:- a bee to clean, there's no hole other than where food goes in so cleaning is basically you playing the dog's game, trying to get all the food pieces out.- smells very strongly of vinyl, this might initially turn off alot of dogs. keep at it, they'll come around."
1,My Lab Shredded it in Minutes!!,"What a waste! I don't even consider my dog a heavy chewer and she has other toys that have lasted for a long time. But not this toy. It was chewed into little orange bits in mere minutes. I would have sent it back the day after receiving it, but it wasn't worth the hassle. Received the Everlasting Treat Ball (large) the same day, and it is still in one piece and keeps her occupied for hours."
1,Too soft,This toy was too soft for my serious chewer. My dog had a hole in this in about ten minutes. If you have a dog that is not a chewer it will be fine.
2,"Not durable at all, even for a small dog","Our dog had a similar ball to this one for about 5 years and it was his favorite toy ever and after 5 years of daily chewing never once left a hole or loose plastic pieces. When we went looking for a replacement, we found this item. This item looks almost identical to the one we had for 5 years, but this one is made of soft, easily-removed-by-dog plastic and only lasted about 3 weeks before we had to take it away from him because we were concerned that he would swallow the plastic that was easily coming off as he chewed it. We ordered another one and after only a few weeks, we will be tossing this one as well. Our dog is less than 20 pounds and is 13 years old and had no problem chewing this ball apart very quickly. This is not a safe toy for your dog. This item easily presents a choking hazard for dogs and I would NOT recommend purchasing it."
2,Not a very tough toy,"Love the concept of this toy and thought it would be a nice change from the standard kongs my pups get. Unfortunately, the first day I left it with my girl, she put two holes in it. The next day, she turned it into a bowl. I guess she prefers efficiency to finess."
4,Great toy,"Very creative toy to keep dogs busy for a little while. Good for small treats inside, not large treats as they cannot get them out and in turn, tear the ball apart to get at the treat. Wish the rubber/plastic was tougher - this toy is very easy for dogs to chew apart. I was a little disappointed in this because my dog loves it and it became a morning ritual to give him before I leave for work. I don't feel like this toy will last very long, and they are not very cheap to replace. All around though, good concept and great intuitive toy for dogs."
4,Fun For Doggie. A Beast To Clean!,"I use this for meal time, (medium-sized dry kibble). It holds about a cup, (if you give it a couple of shakes), which is what doggie eats. The food comes out quickly at the beginning and then slows down, which prolongs the fun.Problem is, you just can't clean the thing. I think I read somewhere that it's dishwasher-safe. Right! It just fills up with filthy water! You have to hand-wash it, shake out as much water as you can, then let it dry, and dry, and dry........And whatever you do, DON'T let it get lost outside with food in it! I made that mistake. The food absorbed water and turned into a solid mass of......I can't even describe it. Somehow, I managed to get it out with some poking and water spray and shaking......Oh, and it's really loud when doggie picks it up and tosses it. Still, he loves it so what can I say?"
4,fun toy,"My lab figured this tow out within about ten seconds of having it, but it still takes her 30 minutes to get all the food out. This is a really great toy that is great while you're eating dinner; your dog will be too preoccupied to beg!"
5,Long lasting and EXCELLENT toy,"Toys don't last too long at our house, but this one has withstood our GSD and Lab. It is still intact AND they still love it. It keeps them totally busy for quite some time - especially when it is down to just a couple of treats. LOVE this toy."
4,Love this treat ball with one minor problem...,"Got this for my beagle. She loves eating her treats and meals out of treat balls. I got this one because it's such a cheap price at Petsmart, and I have one other type of treat ball that my dog loves. Our dog doesn't chew on the treat balls, so we don't really have a problem with her ripping things up.I like this ball, but the problem I have with it is that if you fill it too full of kibble, a handful (10 or more pieces of kibble) will fall out at times while the dog is moving it around. I like treat balls that only have one or two pieces of kibble come out at a time. So that is a down side to this one. I just can't put all of her meal in it at a time, and have to divide it up and fill the ball two or three times. If I do that, then only a couple of kibble fall out at a time and that is how I like it. Otherwise, she will wolf down the food much too quickly.Overall, this is a good treat ball."
2,Not much better than using a food bowl,"The hole is much too large for most kibbled dog food. I bought this as a replacement for a lost feeding ball looks the same as the one in the picture. They are not the same. The hole in this new ball is much larger. It used to take Rusty about ten minutes to empty his old ball, but only about a quick minute for this one.The whole point is for the treat ball to be ""tricky"", as in this ball's name. There's no trick and no fun in this one."
4,Keeps the two dogs busy,We have two Australian Cattle Dogs. It took them about 15 seconds to figure out how to get the treats out of the toys. The good thing is that the process of getting the treats is a long one so it still takes time to get the treats out. I think that if the two dogs weren't so food motivated they would get bored very quickly with these.Pros: It is a good toy to give to keep them busy for 15 minutes or so.Cons: It is very difficult to clean. I had to drill a hole in the bottom to allow the water to drain out when I clean them. It dropped one start due to this other wise it would get 5 stars.
3,if only it weren't so chewable...,"it was really difficult for my dog to get food to come out, which would be great, but she decided to just chew it open to get the food out. 5 unsupervised minutes later, everything was too quiet, and I found her tearing the ball apart -- my dog is only 20 lbs. Oh well, she's quite a chewer and really, really loves food, so I guess I should have expected it."
2,I don't like it and neither does my border collie,So yesterday after about a month of having this toy and my dog never playing with it I had to fish out the stale dog treats and it was a pain. The dog can not get the treats out easy enough and he got bored after a couple minutes. I think this toy should be redone with a better way for owners to get the treats out that the dog does not get and make treats simpler to get out so the dog stays interested. I'm sure this toy is fine for some dogs but in my house we are not a fan.
2,Easily destroyed,"Perfect size ball, perfect size hole, bad material. Might work great if your dog never chews. Mine did and destroyed it in the first hour."
2,Caution,"I am a pet sitter and just wanted to remind people that if this ball has only one hole in it, a dog biting down on it can create a vacuum and the dog's tongue can get sucked in and the dog will not be able to pull the ball off. I have seen a heartbreaking case of a large dog that's tongue got sucked into the ball and before anyone noticed, the tissue had died and the dog's tongue had to be amputated. Please be sure this ball has at least two openings in the boy before giving it to your pet. Make sure there is no vacuum created if the one hole is stopped up. Save you pet from permanent damage."
2,Smells very strongly of rubber,"The strong smell of rubber is nauseating and has persisted for a few weeks already (despite repeated washing of the ball). Also, my dogs are not really interested in this toy because, depending on the size of treats, they can be nearly impossible to get out.Glad to read other dogs tend to like it though."
1,Worthless for dogs over 40 lbs,My lab chewed it apart the first time he played with it. What a waste of money! I should have just bought a Buster Cube in the first place!
2,Easily Destroyed by Mid-Sized Dog,I have a Boston Terrier and this toy simply would not hold up to slight play. In less than 30 minutes he had busted around the hole where you insert treats. I was very disappointed with this item.
2,Can't clean it out,"How do you clean this if the dog takes it outside, gets water in it and the treats gets moldy? Impossible!We love the ball, but we are on our fourth one because we can't clean the inside out.If you purchase this, DO NOT let your dog take it outside!"
2,Outgasses a horrible plastic smell,"This works fine for dispensing treats, but it has a very bad, sort of sweet plastic smell that you can smell several feet away. Didn't seem to bother the dog any, but it was very unpleasant for people. I've had it for about three weeks now and the smell is diminished but still not completely gone."
2,Entertaining but Not for Heavy Chewers!,"My dog really loved this toy but I found that I couldn't trust him to be alone with it because he would begin to chew it. The rubber it is made out of is not hard enough and a heavy chewer can chew through in a few minutes. Watching him and telling him to roll it and not chew it helped, but I didn't ever leave him alone with it. After playing with it a few times he did manage to chew open the ball. Its a great entertaining toy if your dog is not a strong chewer, but if he is I would recommend finding something else, especially if the goal is to entertain your dog while you are away."
3,A little disappointed,Bought this for our 8 mo old standard poodle who loves the Busy Buddy Tug Jug. This ball isn't near the challenge the tug jug is getting treats out. It's too bulky to chew on.
2,Definitely NOT for heavy chewers...,"After reading the reviews, I decided to give this product a shot with my 1yr old Am Staff mix. Filled it with kibble, all was well for about 15 seconds. When he realized there was food inside and it wasn't coming out fast enough, he chewed a hole in this item in about 5 minutes flat. Several reviewers have said this was better than the Kong Stuff-A-Ball, but to be honest, he did the exact same thing to that item too. Chewed off the flaps that are supposed to hold the treats inside. I would highly recommend against purchasing this item for any of the ""bully breed"" dogs, as if they're anything like mine, it won't even last a day."
4,Fun for our dogs,"Our Pomeranian had a treat ball like this since he was a puppy and it was one of his favorite toys. Somehow it got lost when he took it outdoors. I was thrilled to find one just like it on Amazon. Beau is enjoying it more than ever, and our new Pomeranian learned to use it quickly, too."
4,Good toy!,"I really like this treat dispensing ball. We have tried others in the past that my beagle really liked but they were too loud or he was able to chew them to bits. We got the large size to discourage our dog's chewing on it.What I like:-This ball is not as hard as some of the cube toys so it doesn't clatter around on my hardwood floors.-Keeps my beagle entertained for over 1/2 hour at a time-Semi-soft material but my dog hasn't been able to chew it to bits (yet)Dislikes:-Really not a puzzle to get the food out, just have to nudge it and as it rolls food comes out-Big hole doesn't make feeding the dog's kibble really challenging with this toy, some of the others we use allow us to regulate how quickly he eats his food (beagles are gobblers)"
2,not for a big dog,"This toy only last about three hours with my boxer mix. She quickly figured that it would be easier to rip the thing open than to roll it around to get at the treats. As stated, she only had it for about three hours before it was destroyed. It might work well for a smaller dog, but I wouldn't advise getting it for a big dog."
5,My Puppy Loves this Ball!,"We have a Beagle/English Pointer mix who is now six months old. He absolutely LOVES this ball. It is the first toy that he has not been able to destroy. He gets so happy when he sees me filling it with his dinner that his whole body wags! He prances around with it, throws it, noses it around, and jumps at it. This is the best dog toy we have ever bought! Would highly recommend it to those whose dogs need additional stimulation to keep them from getting too bored."
2,Not a chance against a chewer,"My dog Emma loved the Omega Paw Tricky Treat ball; and it succumbed to her devotion in short order and now lies in pieces on the carpet. Emma is admittedly qualified to be the ultimate tester for the durability of dog toys. She was able to rip the top off a Kong within minutes The one toy that Emma has loved more than any other, and it doesn't have even the tiniest bit of damage after 6 months of her ardent attention: the Everlasting Beanie Ball or BentoBall: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000X2RUX0/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i01 She loves it with or without the treats and plays fetch with and gnaws on it when there's no treat in it. I'm going to order another one of those--after I get the red, plastic Omega carnage cleaned up."
1,My dog shredded it in 10 minutes!,"The concept of this ball is great. My dog loved it and quickly figured out she could roll it around to get treats. However as soon as she started to chew on it (even though we got the larger size so she couldn't chomp down too hard) she managed to destroy it within 10 minutes. I had to throw it out so she didn't choke on the plastic pieces she was ripping off. I was really hoping this would be more like the green ""everlasting"" treat ball that we have had for years and is still in one piece. My dog has gotten so good at that one that I was looking for a new challenge, but that didn't work out."
1,Ever hopeful.....,"I bought two treat dispensing toys. I have two Airedales and they both were excited by this toy and wanted to play with it even after the treats were gone. However, within minutes, my ""chewer"" had rendered it useless. The large kong is still intact and enjoyed. I previously had a Bobs a Lot and that lasted for many months until the chewer got the top off and chewed the neck of it. Really wish the Omega ball was longer lasting. It had great potential."
5,WOW! First One I've Heard By Them...Gotta Get MORE!!!,"I can't believe that no one's reviewed this yet!! First off-what a great band!! I love all the influences that I hear in their brand of hard/pop rock!! And they wear them all so well. Throw together Bad Company,Coney Hatch,AC/DC,Whitesnake,Van Halen..hell-you name it!! Just great 'pared-down' straight ahead rock n' roll,and a smattering of also-great ballads.Even a coupla cool tastefully done covers here ( Mighty Quinn & He Ain't Heavy,He's My Brother). This is truely a great rock n' roll disc AND band. Get This NOW..you won't be sorry!Enjoy!!"
2,Needs better engineering for the straps,This bra at first seem great. I liked the lift sling in the front and it was comfortable...for the first hour or so. Then I started to feel less and less comfy and less support. When I took it off I realized why. The metal piece attaching the strap to the back was sideways. it is like there is not enough material to fill the slot and it turns and just becomes uncomfortable. This is my last resort bra these days.
2,not for me,I guess Glamorise bras are not for me - I've tried a couple and none have really fitted correctly. Maybe you will have better luck. Also had problems with the vendor (Freshpair) charging me a restock fee in contradiction to the terms published on the invoice.Glamorise Women's MagicLift Active Support Bra #1005
2,"Not very comfy and I do not see any ""LIFT""","This bra is NOT very comfortable and I do not see ANY lift! I was recently measured so I know I have the correct size, but this one is just not that great! I recommend Playtex!!"
2,ouch!!!,this could actually be a great bra but the straps dig into your shoulders. if you can get over being in pain then try it.
2,No support for DDD/E/F Weird cups,Pros: Ordered my usual size and it fit. Pretty pink color. Back design is good.Cons: No lift/support. Cups are odd shape and no separation.Ordered my usual size and it fit. But no support/lift or separation. The back design is nice but that is only half of what I need for a bra. Returning.
4,perfect bra,Great lift with no wires. Excellent design. The shoulder straps do not slip at all which is a must for me. I feel well supported in this bra and intend to buy more. All that being said I measure at a 48G which is what I ordered this bra in. The bra is very generous. When I order another I will order it in a 44G. The cup size was perfect but the band size is huge. However I liked and needed the bra too much to return it I just modified it a little. Very very affordable compared to other bras of this size.
2,Scratchy!,"I was not impressed by this bra. It is scratchy, not soft like I had hoped. I will return it."
5,great bra!!,Finally a bra for us bigger girls that keeps the shoulder straps up and lifts the bust.Really well constructed and washed well. I will buy more to replace my old bras soon.
3,"Not bad, but not great","Pros: The straps don't fall off my shoulders, support is okay (I'm full figured, I have yet to find anything that is perfect support). Cons: The cushioned inner bust band always seems to fold over, i have to reach my fingers in after the bra is on and straighten it out - I feel as though I am stretching the cups out doing this. After several washings (and air drying only), the material is beginning to get small pills. It isn't one of my favorite bras, but definitely isn't one of the worst."
4,Puckery seams,"This is the second time I've ordered these bras. I really like the first bras I ordered because they fit well and I'm pleased with the quality. I don't hand wash my bras and these have done well in the washing machine. This second set of bras seem generally well made and fit pretty well, but unlike my first set of bras, the seam over the breast is puckery and shows through some clothing."
4,"Great bra, wish it had gel straps","I wear a 44H and this is the only bra that I like. It fits my body well and actually lifts me up a little bit. The only thing that I could see as an improvement would be to add some sort ofCushion gel strap or something similar. It doesn't make me itchy, isn't painful to my shoulders, and is super comfy for stay at home moms like me who are moving all day!"
1,The seams on the cups are UGLY,"This would be a great bra, but the seam that runs through the cup is UGLY under a t-shirt. I supposed I could put on a camisole to disguise the seams, but in South Miss, it's too hot to wear all that extra material in the summer. Hate it, but am going to have to return this item."
2,Why lift and separate?,"While I love this bra as far as comfort and support, I'm giving it only two stars for the ""separate"" feature. Why do most bra manufactures think we plus-size women want to be lifted and separated? I finally found a bra (from Amazon) that I hope will work. I wear a 42H bra, and most bras that lift and separate make my breasts look like they're growing out of my arm pits. The new bra not only lifts but provides support at the sides, so I'm upfront and center and my breasts are where they're supposed to be, i.e. growing from my chest, not my armpits! If this new bra, which should arrive on Friday, fits as I hope, that will be the only bra I'll ever buy again. In addition the price on the new one is reasonable. If others of you have the ""growing out of your armpit"" problem, just search for a side support bra.This is the bra I ordered and hope works:Goddess Women's Keira Soft Cup"
1,Spend a little more to get a good bra,"This bra offers bare minimum support, it is not an active wear sports bra unless you consider ""active"" to be sitting on the couch. It's also uncomfortable and the fit is off."
3,O. K. Bra,"I find the band rolls easily, making the bra uncomfortable. The size is perfect. It is more comfortable than the underwire I have been wearing, but not what I expected for the price."
3,Interesting book,I found this book very interesting but the author needs to brush up on his Russo-German war history a bit.
1,my mistake,I was in a hurry and I did not pay enough attention and assumed this would be baroque. The 2nd half of it is all very modern and to my limited interest unappealing. So read the contents carefully if you are picky.
1,It was faulty on the last title to be played The Carnival of Venice,I returned this to New Castle. Box 15550. I have heard nothing. The date of the return was 15/05/07 from my Throop postoffice in Dorset. I sent it recorded delivery. Over to you. There was nothing on the return screen to explain the fault. ie faulty track. So after many attempts to get intouch I sent it to the address on the paper inside the parcel. Please help.I am a Grandmother so I am over 13 ???
4,Adoption from a Christain's View Point,"At first glance, Kay Strom seemed to have written just another common place book on the adoption process. But upon further reading, I was very impressed by the thought provoking manner in which she encourages each individual considering or going through the adoption process to seek the Lord's guidance for each step taken. She does not ""sugar coat"" adoption like it's the TV sitcom ""THE BRADY BUNCH,"" but weaves in accounts of actual families as they made their way through adoption. Though not a technical reference book like THE ADOPTION RESOURCE BOOK by Lois Gilman (by the way, is an invaluable adoption tool), Kay Strom makes you stop and evaluate your motivations before you jump into adoption. I highly recommend this book to any Christain since she does not ""push"" any particular ""religious affiliation"" when she encourages one to seek the Lord for His guidance."
1,Amazon's Fault,Tie wraps were a total loss. They appeared to have been stored at an excessive temperature. Almost every one of them broke or cracked right out of the package. Couldn't even tighten them without breaking. Even though they are UV protected they couldn't take the excess heat. I have purchased GB tie wraps from other sources and they have been excellent.
5,Beautiful Sunride,"Beautiful music from a beautiful person. I am a big fan of baritone saxophone, so I relish releases like these. Dale Fielder works his magic on the big horn-not too mention the awesome rhythm section!(check out his other great recordings) I would suggets this recording in a heartbeat."
1,Misleading photo,"These are very weak magnets, not even strong enough for a refrigerator magnet. They are also a lot smaller than the photo indicates. The large blue magnet is about 4 1/4 inches across and the others are much smaller."
5,"Cute, unique magnets",I've got these magnets on my filing cabinet and on my fridge and they are plenty strong. Very bright colors and you get 3 in one package. Love them!
1,"Bad Quality, Feels very cheap","First of all the order received had broken pieces and the quality of these ceramic items is below a 1 star. Returned the item. The lid for the oil and vinegar jars are terrible, feels like its going to come off. Definitely not something I will use in my kitchen. Spend the extra bucks on something else that is quality."
1,The only true DUD in the Jimmy Webb catalogue,"Jimmy Webb is a true musical genius. Though best known for the countless hit covers of his material, his solo records all offer delights as well. Well, all his solo records EXCEPT this one. Lethargic melodies, dull arrangements and just plain b-o-r-i-n-g. ANY other Webb solo album is many times better than this. (Tip to those wondering where to start: ""Letters"" is the best solo album, if you can find it)."
3,Benny Smith Is Dead Wrong,"Regarding the Bellesiles affair: The Yale Law Review, The William and Mary Quarterly, Columbia University and countless other reputable sources have destroyed Bellesiles' claims. He resigned from Emory before he could be fired, his grant at the Newberry Library was revoked, his Bancroft Prize was rescinded (the first time this happened in the history of the prize) and Knopf and Assoc. Publishers stopped publication of his embarrassing attempt at false scholorship. It's very telling that the paperback issue of 'Arming America' (from a small publisher) has somehow misplaced over 8,000 sources cited in the removed Knopf version.Back on topic, this is a pretty good book detailing how the new history book publishing mills work today."
1,Product was damage,This product was damage unfortunately y take it to abother country so i wasnt able to ask for guaranty it cost me 150 dolar to repair it.
2,"interesting, but no classic","Good compilation of information (as you can probably judge from the 5-page bibliography), but not much of a leisurely read. Discusses possible origin of the polynesians, ancient ruins found on the said islands, as well as legends and artifacts passed on through generations. The author manages to touch alot of topics, but as a general interest book, it just doesn't work."
4,Concise and Informative,"This is a very compact book which covers both history and basic theology. It begins with the influence of Presbyterians on the early history of our country. Then it traces the roots of Presbyterianism from John Calvin, through the early Scottish church, to the growth and splintering of the denomination in the New World. It also covers the basics of Presbyterian theology."
2,"cute, but nothing new","i do like the layout of the book, the illustrations, but it was really lacking in content. i bought that book eager to discover new things about female sexuality but i didn't. there was nothing in that book that i didn't already know. if yr looking for something cute to give to a grrlfriend, this may be it. but if you want something that you will really use and that will really help in explaining things or techniques, go for something else.also, this book is aimed for heterosexual women so if yr into grrl-on-grrl, you may feel left out while reading this.xoxo"
4,Cute but,"While the text and pictures manage to illuminate the subject well enough, the information can be gotten cheaper and more fully from other sources. If you want to touch lightly on the subject, this is your text. If you want to plunge deep into the territory, there are better resources."
5,the Clitourist,The Clitourist is a fresh and delightful little book. I t really made me laugh out loud. I absolutely loved this book.
5,Seelenluft - Out Of The Woods,"In a way, you could call Seelenluft's second album, OUT OF THE WOODS, poppier than his first, but this in no way implies weaker material. Indeed, on the Elvis-sampling ""L.A. Woman,"" he still shows his mastery of mood and sound. ""Manila,"" in its various remixed forms, became a minor club hit, but the album version has a jazzy vibe, despite the young man singing about airplane disasters. But with the delicate, romantic ""Aircondition,"" the album shows off a newfound confidence with lyrics. It's a lovely track. ""Dancing Grandma,"" on the other hand, indulges in a bit of funk, and ""The Evil Frog"" is a dark parable about fame, God, and the Devil (though it falls firmly on the side of Satan). The angular, fascinating ""Yoa Gongla"" takes a Vietnamese folk song and transforms it into a mysterious journey."
5,At his best,"I've recently collected the entire Jan Akkerman album discography and C.U. is one of the standouts. Though it updates the Akkerman sound with percolating electronic riffs, he isn't a prisoner of the style -- his playing is vigorous and generous. Other keepers: Passion, an all-acoustic album; Focus in Time, Akkerman at his proggiest; and various live albums including 10,000 Clowns and the Live in Concert 2007/The Hague DVD/CD set. It's no accident that all of my favorites are from the mid-1990s moving forward. Akkerman has been enjoying a major artistic resurgence. I just wish he would come to the U.S. (at least NYC) and let his many American fans witness it in person."
5,Toward more positive relationships,"This book outlines a simple and positive approach to maintaining intimacy with loved ones. It encourages us to look to the innate wisdom we all possess for answers to life's questions. Pransky's work is based on the inspiration provided by Syd Banks. I have been fortunate enough to attend a number of workshops led by Dr. Pransky and his associates and I came away with an awareness that has revolutionized my life. My partner and I love and cherish one another and we read this book to help us make things even better between us.Sadly, the book was shipped in very wasteful packaging, a practice followed by too many Amazon sellers in this time of increasing shipping costs."
5,This book is not at all like the other relationship books.,"I collect self help books. I happened upon this book while going through my mom's things after her death. It is an older book, but with a dramatic difference from other self help books. I have learned so much positive information that actually makes sense. It is about compassion, intelligent conversation and actions. It shows how we over-react to situations and then things get all out of porportion. It also tells how to fix it and this is the one book that suggests that you alone, without the help of your partner, can put your relationship back on the right track. It is as basic and yet profound as can be. The main ideas is to use positive reinforcement and positive therapy to enable permanent change in relationships and their dynamics."
4,Earthly life of Jesus,"The chapters of this volume tell us simply and clearly the story of the earthly life of Jesus. What did Jesus think of himself and his relation to his world, and what is the meaning of his life an work for us today? Chapters include: A child is born, A voice in the wilderness, The Galilean Ministry, the Crisis in Galilee, the journey to Jerusalem, the Crucifixion and Resurrection."
5,"A great ""graduation"" present for kids in speech therapy!","I gave this book to a 7-year-old speech therapy client of mine as a present when he ""graduated"" from working on S's, and he loves it! It made him so proud to be able to read it out loud all by himself! I'm sure he's still torturing his parents with it!"
2,Wrong book,"Dr. Seuss is great - our kids and grandkids alike have loved his books. Fox in Socks may not be as popular as the Cat in the Hat, but they are in the same genre and excellent for beginning readers.We ordered the book using a link supplied by our daughter to the Amazon website, and that link showed the book in English. However, when the book was received, it was a dual language book (English plus Chinese or some other Asian language that we neither read nor speak). i hope Amazon doesn't make mistakes like this very often!"
2,"Love the book, very upset with what I received","We have this at home for our son, so I bought it for a friend as a baby gift. When I received the book, I was very upset to find out that the entire book was written in both English and either Japanese/Chinese/Korean characters. It was too late for me to attempt to return the book and get a new copy, but very upset to have to try to explain this to the friend for whom I bought this. The picture shows the characters, but the description did not describe that."
5,Fox in Socks,"Do you like rhymes for just dimes? Funny characters looking odd or a smile while you nod? Get this book its great whether you are a lass or a mate, read it with a sandwich or a hoagie if you are a young spry of an old foagie."
5,review,i think that the story is more of a ryming thing and also is a message doent trust someone that you know is going to do smething and you trust them anyway you know what their going to do.
4,A fun book for beginning readers!,"The beauty of this classic Dr. Seuss is in the simplicity of the rhyming text and the accompanying humorous illustrations. Like Seuss' other title, ""Hop On Pop"", the controlled vocabulary and clues provided by the illustrations, allow children who are beginning readers to proudly read the book by themselves. Again and again and again, much to their delight! Recommended for children ages 4-8."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"The Fox is certainly a better vulpine than I am, given that I couldn't stand running around with socks on my feet.This incongruity is perhaps part of why I found this book highly amusing as a very young kid, so, a good fun production by Seuss."
1,Horrible,"Used book which I knew, however, all pages were nit attached to the spine of the book. I received a cover with loose pages.Horrible, never again!!!"
1,The worst of Seuss,"My wife bought this for our daughter for christmas several years back and frankly it is a terrible book. This coming from a huge fan of Dr. Seuss. It basically has no story or interesting plot at all. The purpose of the book is just to have a bunch of tongue twisters just to have them there. I really was surprised how bad this book was since I love so many other Dr. Seuss books (our child has at least 15 other seuss books we love). Honestly, my child picks this book periodically for bed time stories, and my wife and i will cringe when reading this. Also, our child doesn't really seem to care for it either."
1,Beware of Seller,"I bought this and it did not come with the cartridge, needless to say my son saw it and I had to explain to him that we had to send it back. Please make sure before you purchase this that it comes with the cartridge. Unfortunately the seller did not specify, so I guess it was my fault for assuming."
4,Not so bad once you get used to it!,"When I first bought this book, I thought it was just another Seuss book, but it is not! At first I hated it and would try to persuade my son into making Daddy read it instead of Mommy, but many nights we would both end up reading it. After having done it so much, it's a breeze now, but it does take some getting used to!"
5,"Fox in Socks, Best Dr. Seuss book","This is a wonderful book for young children learning tounge-twisters. And, rest assured, adults who grew up with Dr. Seuss certainly get a kick out it, too."
5,great introduction to reading and wonderful bonding!!!,"Dr. Seuss' Fox in Socks is by far one of my three most favorite books from childhood. What great detail is to be found in the illustrations, classic fantastic images on page after page, which, alone, are worth the price of the book. however, it has words and somewhat of a plot. for us old geezers, the font is big enough to see! It contains many episodes between that pesky Fox wearing socks and Mr. Knox. As with all of Dr. Suess' writings, it contains numerous tongue-twisting pages that bring out howling and laughter in our home. Of course, it's usually dad who'se the subject of the laughter. [a word of advice: parents, never reading this book after an exhausting day or after you've taken sleeping medicine or you'll embarrass yourself with tonge twisters.] This book holds a special, magical place in my heart, so, with great bias, I highly recommend it for everyone who is or was a kid and I give this an A+."
4,Abridged is a slight bummer,"We love the Fox in Socks book, it is a wonderful rhyme and just flows so well. This book is abridged, like all the tiny hardcover ones, but maybe because we were so used to the original full length book, this one just didn't flow for us with all of its deletions. Needless to say, it still has fun rhymes on the pages and the kids do like to read it. It just isn't quite the original."
1,Worst book on the subject.,"I'm not going to waste too many words on this textbook. First, this textbook utilizes lower secondary Spanish which would not even pass in a real Latin American university. Second, this textbooks uses examples which are taken out of their historical context in order to fit into the social commentary which the authors are attempting to make. Each chapter is a generalized portrait of Latin America which attempts to paint it with the same brush and hue, when in fact its history and its peoples are as diverse as its geography and Eco-systems. This isn't the first course I have taken on Latin American society, but this is by far the worst textbook that has been written on it. Of course, for most students, purchasing this textbook isn't quite an option, but be forewarned that it should be read with a grain of salt."
2,Pass this one!,"This probably was a promising video record of an event that has been marred by bad audio. The audio sounds horribly compressed and muted. The drums sound like they are being played through some cheap speakers! The sound could not be rescued by any amount of ""fiddling"" with the system. I am disappointed."
1,Horrible sound,How anyone can release a recording with audio that is anything less than what can be achieved with today's technology is shameful.Sounds like it was recorded under water.
5,"Terrific, timeless overview of greatest classical guitar.","I don't know what brought you to look over this page, but you shouldn't leave without dropping ""Guitar--Greatest Hits"" in your shopping cart. I bought this cassette ten years ago and absolutely loved it. I updated to a CD copy a few years back and swear by it for sleeping, driving, relaxing. Williams's consummate musical talent gives voice to some of the greatest classical guitar pieces ever, by the best composers ever (Albeniz, Sergovia, Vivaldi, etc.). The technique is brilliant, the melodies breathtaking. Nothing sounds quite like nylong string classical guitar, and few command the instrument like Williams. You can't be without this collection, and you can't beat this price. Order multiple copies now. I kid you not. You'll thank me."
3,Errors,"I was somewhat disappointed with this book. Being a family member of Gary Tison, I was shocked that someone could put so much fiction in a book that is supposed to be a true story. He should have done a little more research."
2,Kinda Stupid,"Good fighting, but even less plot then what most of us are used to from these older kung fu films. Really dumb ending and not in a ""neat dumb"" way. DVD extras are really bad, but the low cost of the DVD itself makes up for it."
2,Old but not classic,"""The Fearless Hyena II"" is another of Jackie Chan's pre-""Snake in the Eagle's Shadow"" films, and is as such in a bad shape from the start. Story wise there's nothing new or interesting to get (as if you'd expect that), and the same goes for the acting and the action really. The fights are choreographed in the same way that all other kung fu movies of the time were: not very good. And that's basically it. Fighting's not good, so the movie fails to deliver, in a sense. Only interesting bit is, that Jackie is spelled Jacky in the credits.Get it if you collect or are a hardcore JC fan. Otherwise leave it be."
1,If you saw Fearless Hyena there is no need to watch this.,"This movie is a rip off. Chan did not finish making this film. He only shot a few scenes and then he left production! However the director took scenes from the first ""Hyena"" and hired a double to make this film. Just watch the final fight in the first and it is the exact same fight in the second. Other than a few original scenes with Chan I really do not see any reason to buy this film. Rent it instead."
3,"Average, not as good as the first one.","If you're a real die hard Jackie Chan fan, and you want a full collection, then this one may be worth getting. Otherwise, rent it or borrow it from a friend. Some good fight scenes, but the final fight is a trifle disappointing and contains little of the creativity seen in the first Fearless Hyena."
3,Fearless Hyena 2 (1980),The story's about these 2 brothers who get together top avenge the murder of their father. The usual.
3,Works but,"i can not analyse the efficacy of the purifier, but i can tell it humidifies.... but golly those replacements are way too expensive- like make you want to canabalize the owners expensive... more regrets for my lifethanks bemis"
4,Martín Rivas,"La literatura chilena es excelente, recuerdo este libro con nostalgia ... volveria a leerlo si lo tuviera en mis manos y tuviese tiempo! Os lo recomiendo desde la primera página os cautivará."
3,Serve the purpose,"These cable ties are OK. They do seem to break fairly easily especially when cold. However, if using them inside or with limited cold exposure you should be fine."
1,Head breaks off immediately,I bought two of these brushes and the heads of both broke off almost immediately. Plastic swivel is thin and cannot take any stress when pushing/pulling snow.
2,my purchase,"I am sorry but, I really don't know what I think of this book as I have not yet received i I am still waiting!"
4,Not a toy for a kid who will PLAY hard...a detailed model,"Very highly detailed, on the high end of Forces of Valor vehicles. My 9 year old son wanted this, and it was purchased for him. He loves WWII stuff. But he does not ""PLAY"" with this stuff like other kids. He sets up battles and stuff, but does not lean on the vehicle to push it or flip it over when an enemy tank scores an imaginary hit. That is what most kids would do, and that is what he does with durable plastic stuff, but he knows better than to play that way with this. So if you are buying this for a child, know that it will not hold up to normal ""play"".By the way, even though I like the Forces of Valor detail, these are NOT die-cast. I don't know how they get away calling them that. They are plastic. Cool, highly detailed, but plastic."
4,Leveled for High School,There is nothing wrong with this book but the reading practice inside is of a high school level. I purchsed it to use with my middle school students but gave it to the high school teacher. I think the reading level should be posted with these items so other teachers don't run into the same problem.
3,Not really the same level as the SAT,"The problems are worth doing, but the level of difficulty is not that of an SAT. In SAT critical reading questions, you will often be asked to make judgements based on a gut feeling of what the author was trying to portray. Also, the SAT readings can contain a few lines that are quite incomprehensible, and you are forced to answer questions even though you are in a state of partial confusion. There are neither of these pitfalls to be seen in this book. Also the readings in this book are shorter. For these reasons, this book has to be supplemented with others for a really good preparation for SAT critical reading."
4,review little at a time.,"Review for spare time. Couple assignments at a time so your child won't be overwhelmed. And before they know it, they are finished with the book and they reinforced what they learned in school. Good way to sneak up on them in terms of getting them to study!"
2,Too difficult for junior high students,I teach a Language Arts Lab class to high school students with a 6th-8th grade reading level. The questions are better suited for 10th or even 11th graders. The title should be changed. My regular ninth grade students--who are a pretty bright group-- would have difficulty with these questions.
1,wrong bender,Length:: 0:28 MinsI recived diferent b ender biger heavy now i have to pay for shipping back
4,CONVENIENTLY WED - what a story!,"Carter King had a list of candidates he was considering to use as a way to get his heir.All it would cost would be money - a shrewd business proposition. Marly Alcott topped his list of candidates. But was she who she says she is?She loves children, is in need of money and seemed to be completely trustworthy. Except she had some secrets of her own.Marly was not about to let Carter find out about Billy Ray Cameron or about Tyler. Would Carter still be around if he did?Things seemed to start falling apart after their marriage and danger reared its' ugly head.Would Carter and Marly be able to resolve the problems presented by the P.I.? What was Carter to believe?Oh yeah, Carter to the rescue.Great story - great characters - wonderful plot.Definitely Recommended"
5,back in business,"A few years back super soaker went down hill when they hit walmart shelves. Cheap, leaky, unreliable, china made worthless material.Well, super soaker is back, and this gun screams quality.Apart from the odd shape, it is made of heavy duty plastics. The pump is solid and the mechanics of it is strong and beefy. Fat rubber seals effectively make it watertight. This all adds up to one quality gun that you can toss carelessly into your back seat of the car without worrying about leaks. It builds pressure quick with only a few pumps, and the water stream is tight and powerful. The quick fill valve concept works great.The gun looks deceivingly small in the pictures but it's actually quite a large gun.Definitely would buy again."
2,Aqua Shock,This water gun is a lot of fun while it lasts. I've owned four of these. The big problem is their weak triggers. After some solid fun with them an internal mechanism tied to the trigger breaks and leaves you defenseless. There's no repairing it either. All that money just went down the tube. This seems to be planned breakage by the manufacturer because the same thing happened to all of these. Would not waste my money on this again.
3,It's Ok,"It's a pretty good Super Soaker. The water blast feature was disappointing. It doesn't compare to the Flash Flood's water blast which is stronger and shoots out more water. In a water battle, your only advantage is the ice cold water you can shoot at your friends. But on a 95 degree day, your enemies just might enjoy you shooting them with ice cold water. Today's Super Soaker's don't compare to the awesomeness of the 2001 line featuring the Monster X and Monster XL. If looking for the best water guns, find an older, second-hand, Super Soaker for sale."
1,Received 2. Both defective.,"On the first that I received, I couldn't get the cap OFF. I couldn't even get it off with a plumber's wrench. On the replacement I received, I couldn't get the cap ON. The threads of the cap would not engage with the threads on the body of the supersoaker. Not sure if the problem is one of design or workmanship."
3,"Okay juvenile, but no really positive qualities","This is obviously aimed at pre-teens and is acceptable enough as such. However, emphasis is on violence and conflict without any underlying substance.The basic X-MEN idea is on the relating between mutants and ordinary humans and the conflict between the mutants who want to control the world ruling or eliminating the rest of humanity and those mutants who want to co-exist with the rest of humanity. This book would've done better to give more depth to such aspects."
2,Their weakest effort,"I'm pretty sure my problem with this release is solidly in the realm of Albin Julius. I've never been a fan of The Moon Lay Hidden Beneath a Cloud, and since all things DiJ up to this point have been wondrous, it's gotta be Albin, right?Not to say there's nothing good about this. Cirro Massimo has a nice, hypnotic feel to it, composed of nothing but what sounds like a loop of the soundtrack to Triumph des Willens, and most of the instrumental work on here has that patented Death in June ""yes, I really AM more mournful than you"" feel to it, but it just doesn't click the same way that earlier releases do."
2,Short XL T-shirt,"I am not an over-sized guy, but after the first wash, the shirt doesn't even cover up my belt. It hardly did before I washed it. I bought a Batman Logo t-shirt in smaller size, and it fits better than this one.Cool graphic otherwise is its saving grace."
5,MOUS Certification Magic!,"There is a CD in the back of this book that will have you functioning in Excel at top speed. Go through it first!Then start with the book. The lessons breakup into 10 minute segments. By the time you are finished with the book you will have the information to pass the MOUS certification test with ease! If you need to review a concept, the keystrokes are printed in red ink so that you don't have to re-read the whole text. I have taught several Excel computer classes using this book as the instruction textbook. Well written!T"
3,I don't know how to use it,"I want to order this item, but I am not sure do I still need a hot plate under the trivet?"
1,Nightmare! I don't know what to do!,"I ordered a Delta Saw ( 5 hp version) on March 13, 2004. I received 3 boxes out of 4 on March 29. The freight company told me that they left the other box ( Biesmeyer) in Kansas. I called the freight company today and they told me they could not locate the package. They told me to get in touch with Amazon. Amazon doesn't respond to my e-mails. In the meantime my orders are getting cancelled. What a nightmare!I heard a lot of good things about this saw. I wish I could use it and write a nice review about it."
3,Unasaw Quality,"I am impressed with this saw, but if a less than perfect is out there to be sold, I'm the guy who will buy it. I took great pains to express my desire for a saw with a flat cast iron top and wings. Both wings on my saw will need fine tuning and the right wing is cupped front to back. I called the store and they responded with ""I wounder if there is a saw out there flat enough for you"" and "" I have never seen it before, did you check our store desplay?"". I think a visible problem not requiring a machinest straight edge to detect is real enough. So I get a bad saw. Then I get insulted. Buy the way the saw top is resonable, but not perfectally flat per my precision straight edge. Yes I was low keyed about the problem. I wounder, if $1800.00 is not enough for a perfect saw out of the box, what is? Maby I should have bought a Jet and just anticipated these things, but no. I bought locally in SLC!"
3,Great saw but fence parts are unavaliable at website.,"The Delta Unisaw is not what it used to be but it is still one of the better choices on the market. The base is no longer cast iron. The ""fit and finish"" could be better but compared to most of the imports it is still the best choice.Buying parts for the fence is a problem. The Biesemeyer website does not contain any parts. It seems that if one breaks a part, he or she will have to replace the whole fence.Some might argue that the parts are available by special order at local dealers. My only comment is, ""Why make it hard to get parts?"""
3,Overall this works good,Somnatrol puts me to sleep within a half hour and I sleep well considering I live in a busy neighborhood and have to sleep during the day.
5,This product helped me get my needed rest,This product is the best in sleep aids I have used. Wigh my hectic schedule it's nice to know I have a great quality product I can count on.
4,Somnatrol helps me sleep,I have trouble sleeping and this product helped with no problem whatsoever.
4,Sleep,"Product definetly makes you feel relaxed, then you sleep. Not too much fanfare. Bang you are sleeping. I don't feel tired when I wake up either so that's good."
4,I like this product- no side effects for me,"I had given up on finding the right sleep aid. Everything either didn't work or made me groggy all day. I really like Somnatrol because it didn't have any side effect on me, as a matter of fact, I only take it when I really need to get to sleep early. I am a night owl..I go to school AND work a late shift on weekends so it's hard for me to stay on a good sleep schedule, especially when I have trouble falling asleep."
4,"It works, most nights","I have had good results on most evenings. It is relaxing, but can make you feel a bit more ""down"" or depressed. A relative of mine can't take seratonin because of its ""blues"" effect. However, overall, it has aided my sleep and I consider it worth the money."
2,Disappointing,"I have had a lot of experience w/many sleep aids. Decided to invest in this one (pretty expensive, I thought) partly because I had never gone ""the natural route"". Although 2, then 3 of the hard-to-swallow caplets did put me to sleep, it was only for the first 3 or 4 times. Even then, the sleep was not sound or uninterrupted. Will not buy this product again."
4,somnatrol,"I've gotten lucky and not had to use this product but a couple of times since I purchased it.It worked very well for me,equal to the RX sleep aids I've used in the past,no drugged feeling in the morning,the cap. size is a little large and might be a problem for some people.I wouldn't suggest leaving the top off for long,it really smells bad."
5,My favorite sleeping product,I have tried many different over-the-counter holistic and non perscriptive sleeping supplements and this one I have found works the best. It doesn't make me groggy the next day and I feel well rested. I have a very crazy sleep schedule. I am happy with Somnatrol.
4,This really works great,I am a big fan of this sleep aid. It really works without feeling sluggish the next day like other stuff I've taken.
1,A waste of money,"As an insomniac and tired of the Tylenol PM and Unisom combo, I decided I should try a ""natural"" route with this product. I eagerly downed the recommended dosage--and nothing! Might as well have taken a sugar pill for all the good it did me. And the odor! Smells like Parmesan cheese aged a bit too long...Oh well, back to the tried and true."
1,Not effective,"I have tried Somnatrol off and on for the past two months. Zero effect on anything. I was quite surprised it didn't even help a little bit, given the reviews here. But my body must be very different from the majority of users here."
2,These reviews are phonies,"The product helps relax you, but I would not put it in the same category as a sleeping pill. If you are a long time sufferer like me, you may read the reviews here and think you finally found the answer, but please do a little investigating before you decide to buy this and you will notice that these reivews are mostly phonies that all follow the same format with names changed. Be careful, They all resemble an infomercial and not a genuine user of the product. Shame on Amazon for allowing this."
1,bogus reviews,"I hoped that I could go to an un-bias place to get a review on a product, in this case Somnatrol. After reading the reviews I found many to be word for word duplicates but with a different summiteers name. This is obvious even to the most casual observer. As a result I find the entire review process here to be bogus and of no help what so ever. The first ""review"" was information taken directly from the web site of the product used as sales promotion. That first review was totally worthless, and from reading the rest I can't take any of them seriously. I have not tried the product yet, but I see I will have to and form my own opinion as there are too many duplicated opinions here to make me have any confidence in the integrity of the information."
5,Very pleased,A whole bunch of cable ties at a decent price and they work as expected. That pretty much sums it up.
4,Listing of Songs,"Side A: The Godfather II, Lenny, The Grande Ball, Lana's Theme, Murder on the Orient Express, San Francisco at Night. Side B: Airport '75, Love Beat of the City, Towering Inferno (We May Never Love Like This Again), Earthquake, Chinatown, Tender Mist."
2,Empty Story with Outstanding Illustration,"I bought this book on the strength of the excellence of James Bennett's work with Jerry Seinfeld, and the quality of that story and its companion live CD. Unfortunately, however, Carl Reiner has written a bland and empty story which my kids and I found totally uninteresting. Ditto for the unimaginative reading on the accompanying CD. James Bennett's illustrations saved this from being a 1 star review."
1,Don't waste your money,"I ordered this and two other similair items. What a waste of money. Stories are useless, not even remotly scary. Background music & effects are worse again.There should be a ""Star Rating"" of ""0"", if there was that's what I would be giving this product"
5,A Scary Story Review,I am a substitute teacher and one day I happen to be working in the library. I had to show this book to a group of second and third graders. They loved it. The cd provides a great mood. It was of course during Halloween time and the book has a Halloween theme to it. Its a little scary but not too much. Your going to love to see the reaction of the kids.
5,Great Book,"This is a very cute book but I have to say that the cd does make the story. We have read it but isn't the same without the cd. The first time we did the story with the cd my son was sitting across the room and didn't want to do it but his younger brother did. Funny though my oldest would peek at the book and finally was on my lap helping turning the pages when needed. Also this is a good book for children who aren't used to listening to a story being read from a cd or tape, just another interesting way to enjoy a book!"
1,"Nope, it's bad news.","I hate saying this over and over again, but Queen are bad. The bucktoothed Freddie Mercury is no match for Carrie Underwood or Fantasia. Get any of their CDs instead."
5,An album every rock fan should have,"This album, News of the World is an album every rock fan should own. Just like the Cars debut album, Boston's debut album to name a few, this album is full of hard rock that will last forever. We listened to this 8-track till it was worn out back in high school and today it sounds just as good on a CD player. People tend to forget just how hard these boys ROCKED !!!"
4,In the,"3 1/2 stars. In the late 70s Prog Rock was on the way out replaced by disco, Punk, Party Funk, Corporate Rock and generally more poppish music (the following year would see the beggining of the New Wave/New Romantic movement further distilling Art Rock) and so like many other prog rock groups like Yes, Gentle Giant and to a certain extent Genesis, Queen moved on to a more simpler and accessible rock sound embracing the simpler times. NOTW featured shorter compositions stripping away the bombast of Queens past efforts hugely (though Queen were already becoming more straight forward with A Day At The Races). Still this is definatly a strong album, theres actually a wide variety of styles here from punk to jazz and its still very much Queen."
4,Queen's response to punk,"In many ways, this seems to be Queen's 1977 answer to punk rock, and it holds up remarkably well after 30-plus years. The opening pairing of ""We Will Rock You"" and ""We Are the Champions"" may seem overplayed today, but at the time they were also a statement of purpose. ""Sheer Heart Attack"" is another blistering rocker. ""Get Down, Make Love"" is blatant sexuality set to music, making nice use the of pauses between the notes, as well as a mid-section that sounds a bit like a game of pinball gone haywire. There are many different bases covered here musically, just in a more stripped-down fashion than usual (not as many layered vocals, overdubs, etc). ""It's Late"" is a slow-building guitar track, ""Who Needs You"" has a laid-back Spanish feel, and ""My Melancholy Blues"" is a perfect album closer, as if Freddie Mercury were singing this piano ballad in some smoky after-hours jazz club. Somehow it all manages to hold together -- and to still sound very much like Queen."
5,QUEEN - News of the World [Vinyl],Perfectly well! I am very happy! Execution of a plate and quality of the Sound - excellent.Shop Amazon work - all quickly and qualitatively.Many thanks!
1,"No ""news"" is good news","Even though this is Queen's best-selling album (just 4,000 copies sold), it was NO match for the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack, which is the best-selling album before Michael Jackson's ""Thriller!"" Ignore classic rock nerds and chart geeks who will say otherwise. This album, by all accounts, is bad. Thanks."
1,"This is bad ""news.""","This Queen CD is bad news, and any moron (inclduing the little guy from India) like the below one star reviewer, should be silenced. Where's the duct tape when you need it?"
3,wtf?,"Queen has some good songs on here, but it's a weak album. WE WILL ROCK YOU/WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS, IT'S LATE, SHEER HEART ATTACK, GET DOWN MAKE LOVE, MELACHONY BLUES, ALL DEAD ALL DEAD, SPREAD YOUR WINGS, WHO NEEDS YOU, AND FIGHT FROM THE INSIDE.Alex (A Queen Fan)"
3,Almost Amazing,"Well, this album was a trip. I really liked it quite alot, but it was a little like slogging through mud at some parts. My favorite was ""who needs you"". It makes me really happy to hear that song. I also loved ""All dead, All dead"" though it did sound alot like the Beatles.The only thing i skip on this album is We will rock you and We are the champions because they are way overused, which unfortunatly ruins two very nice songs. I hate people who think they know the music of Queen just because they have heard these dreadfully overused songs. :( grrrrr.... I suppose I like ""Spread you Wings"", but i really am not a fan of ""get down make love."" I wish it had more of a tune because the lyrics are raunchy and fun. I adore ""Its late."" I really suggest you buy this album beacuse its a nice mix of songs and it does have a certain aura. I will love Queen forever. R.I.P. Freddie! I love you!!"
5,"You're Just 17, all you wanna do is disappear!","This album will ROCK YOU. Including all of the songs on the EP. Be sure to find the Remix of ""We Will Rock You"" from the 1991 CD as well. Listening to the album speaks for itself, and the remaster simply rocks n rolls!"
4,A Timely Reappraisal,"If it's been awhile, listen to ""It's Late"" again. You'll discover that Queen was / were still at their bombastic best."
5,Queen at their best!!!....,"This isn't there best album, but it comes close!!! With the very, very famous songs like: ""We Will Rock You,"" ""We are the Champions,""....which are played every day of the year at most sporting events!...this album has many great works on it! With the hard tempo of Mercury's ""Get Down, Make Love""..to ""Sheer Heart Attack""...this album has different styles of music!!!(as do most of Queen's albums!) Especially when you listen to ""My Melancholy Blues"" and ""All Dead, All Dead""..you'll know what I'm talking about...I think most people could enjoy this album! I still love it! Well worth the money!!"
5,We Will Rock You isn't the only song on this CD,"This is one of the first albums that I had when it came out in the 70s. Everybody knows the classic ""We Will Rock You/ We Are the Champions"" The rest of the songs on this CD are equal if not superior to these(with the exception of the horrible remix of We Will Rock You) Check out Roger Taylor's ""Sheer Heart Attack"" and Freddie's ""Get Down Make Love"" not to mention Brian May's brilliance on ""Sleeping on the Sidewalk""- classic Queen-every song on News of the World is great. ""It's Late"" is probably the best ""unheard of"" song that Queen ever recorded. Not too many groups can come close to the extreme talent that Queen was- News of the World proves it."
2,Beware vinyl lovers...,"Great music ruined by awful sound...another sad victim of the ""loudness wars"". They sucked all of the dynamic ranged out of this thing to make the CD loud and then simply dumped it to vinyl. My original pressing sounds light years better than this in spite of its age. Avoid."
4,Legendary exchange between rock icons,"It is said (no doubt apocryphally) that when Queen were recording News of the World, the band in the next studio was their EMI labelmates, the Sex Pistols. One afternoon an inebriated Sid Vicious stumbled into the wrong studio, and spotted Freddie limbering up at the piano.""Freddie Mercury!"" he exclaimed. ""Still bring ballet to the masses, are we?""Freddie didn't miss a beat. ""Oh! Mister Ferocious! Well, we are doing our best, dear"".Messrs Mercury and Ferocious. Both sadly missed, in my book.Olly Buxton"
3,Lowpoint of the Decade for Queen,"While this dips nowhere near as far as they'd go with Hot Space, this is indisputably the worst of Queen's albums from their greatest decade. Well, I guess it's disputable if you didn't like the pomposity (or grandeur as I see it) of the first five albums. However, Queen was arguably the most talented band in the history of rock, so even playing the simple material on this album, they do it up right. All Dead, All Dead is a shining jewel, and It's Late is wonderful. Excessive radio play has dampened my appreciation of We Are The Champions, but it is a very good song. The rest of the album runs from either run-of-the-mill (by Queen's standards) glam/blues rock to horrid punk (Get Down, Make Love and Sheer Heart Attack, ick). It gets a three because even at their worst Queen isn't that bad (the aforementioned Hot Space excluded)."
3,MFSL Gold CD Version...,"I was somewhat disappointed with the sound of the MoFi gold CD. This CD suffers from over-mastering... too much top and bottom end EQ was applied during mastering. The result is midrange suck out which takes away power from the instruments, especially the vocals and guitars. The Hollywood CD sounds harsh so I recommend finding an old EMI CD from the UK. It wasn't overdone during mastering and has a more natural and powerful sound. Just turn the volume up a little."
4,"Heretic, You sir are an idiot","Vanilla Ice sampled queen, not the other way around. While queen might not be my favorite band ever, they were creative, and no other band sounds like them. Unlike your favorite bands ( nSync, Backstreet, britney, etc). If you like run of the mill pop, then why are you reviewing music that is out of your listening realm? You are giving perfectly good cd's 1 star ratings because you dont like the style of music they play. You need to be booted!!!"
4,A Great Lighthouse Travel Guide,"Bruce Roberts is one of the best lighthouse photographers working in the U.S. today. In this book, he and his partner Ray Jones give you an excellent photograph of each lighthouse featured, a short historical story from Jones and directions of how to get to the lighthouse. Lighthouse lovers could scarcely ask for more."
5,Pacific Northwest Lighthouses,"This is an excellent book with great descriptions and beautiful pictures. If you are interested in lighthouses, this book is detailed, informational, and fun."
5,My Favorite Story,"This was my favorite story next to Scuffy the Tugboat. Unfortunately all of my books went to my older sister's kids, and they did not take very good care of them, so they are all lost now. I have my first child coming in July (Ian Gabriel) and I'm looking for a copy of this book (and from the reviews, it looks like I'm not alone). Maybe the publisher will decide to reprint it."
2,Interminable,"Amelia Peabody and her brood often take their time in geting down to the business of a tale. In Lord of the Silent, however, I wasn't sure if the action ever really started, despite a series of false apprehensions. Perhaps Peters bit off too much to chew: WW I, Egyptology, the antiques market, global spying and various household crises. A bit too cute, too precious, and too long."
3,Always a Peabody fan!,I was so excited to get this latest installment of the Emerson clan mysteries. However it sure was slow going at first. I thought it didn't get interesting until almost halfway through. Though any Peabody mystery is worth reading.
5,Elizabeth Peters Does it Again,"Kudos for a job well done. Elizabeth Peters mysteries are somewhat formulaic, but so well written that one never notices 'til the end. Peter's books are entertaining and educational (she has a Ph.d. in Egyptology). Her characters, the Emersons, are an endearing and hilarious family of archaeologists who have a knack for attracting trouble. If you have not read any of this series, you can start with any of them. Be warned that these books are a lot like potato chips, you can't read just one. I buy all of them hardbound because I reread them that much."
1,No suspense,"I should have known this book would be bad when the Amazon.com reviewer remarked that ""Innovation can be overrated."" The author has completely run out of ideas. There is not much plot to speak of. Much of the book consists of characters ruminating about things that happened in prior books. More than half the book concerns Ramses and Nefret - absolutely perfect, gorgeous, intelligent, plucky, devoted, and totally boring. They belong in a romance novel. The only suspense here was wondering if I would bother finishing the book. The only mystery was why I bought it. The first couple of books in this series were good - stick to them and skip this one."
2,Lord of the Silent,"Please no more Ramses and Nefret! I adore the Amelia Peabody series but please can't we focus on the stars of the series--Amelia and Emerson. I find Ramses and Nefret dead bores. Amelia and Emerson have one of the best written love stories I have ever read. I love the first books through the Snake, Crocodile and the Dog, but the later books are too full of characters and too much focus on Rameses and Nefret. Amelia and Emerson are too much the background characters forced to do nothing but wring their hands and endlessly speculate on what Ramses and Nefret are doing. However, even in the later books the plots are riveting and it's difficult to figure out who the bad guys are. I wish the ""editor"" would discover those missing Amelia Journals she keeps mentioning so we can return to the early days of their adventures with their wonderful bickering and witty humor that makes me laugh out loud."
1,Confusing and long-winded,"This was the first of Ms. Peters' books that I read. Maybe if I had had the background of the other books, I would have found it more interesting. As it was, I kept thinking ""Get on with it already"". There were too many exceprts about Nefret and her hubby and then it would switch back to Peabody and Emerson, and it rarely went back to the murder. When it did, there were so many characters and so many nicknames for characters that I was totally confused and often had to go back in the book to see who was who. The setting in this book and Peabody's wit kept me reading, though."
1,amateurish blather,"Elizabeth Peters (aka Barbara Michaels) used to know how to write a great, scary mystery. Now she needs to hang it up."
2,Dull and Dry,"I was thoroughly disappointed while reading Lord of Silent, as the overall action and suspense was kept almost at a minimum.It seems almost as if Peters went on a long tangent about the Emerson's family life, writing a lot of filler to go along with the main plot. Until the last forty pages or so, I struggled to get through the book because there was no suspense at all. No cliff-hangers or anything of the sort.Ramses and Nefret, though darling, only thickened the struggle. I don't think that all the interaction between them was really necessary; perhaps Peters wanted to throw in some romance, but is wasn't working.Lord of the Silent is a sheer failure of Peters's story-telling skills, as in many of her other books her talent proves to be quite brilliant. Save your money and buy a different Peters's book."
5,Don't let this one get by you,"I truly enjoyed this book by Ms. Peters. it had ""just enough"" of political plot, mystery plot, and Ramses plus Nefret. After reading it, I found myself delving back in time to find more information on the development of the relationship between Ramses and Nefret.All in all, 200% enjoyable!"
3,Not Her Best Amelia,"I have enjoyed all the Amelia Peabody books, particularly, though I may be in the minority here, the four ""stand alones""-Seeing a Large Cat, The Ape Who Guards the Balance, The Falcon at the Portal, and He Shall Thunder in the Sky.I was a little disappointed in Lord of the Silent. It seemed anticlimactic after the edge-of-your-seat action of He Shall Thunder in the Sky. An enjoyable story, but not as gripping, or as funny as some of the other Amelias. I have to say,though-I do fall more in love with Ramses with every book! A good one for die hard Amelia fans, but I wouldn't recommend it as representative of this fabulous series."
1,At least 25% text has characters declaring their greatness,"Being on the lookout for new authors this series seemed very promising. The reviews were great mentioning mystery, Egyptologists, and a turn-of-the-century setting. Being enthusiastic I ordered ""The Falcon at the Portal"" and ""Lord of the Silent"". In both books, Amelia tells us over and over she is bright, clever, beautiful, etc. She tells us how her husband is the greatest Egyptologist of all time, he's brillant, he's strong and women cannot resist him. Rames is brillant, brave, master of disguise, and women cannot resist him. Nefret is brillant and beautiful. Now there is 6 year old Sennia who is well on her way to learning hieroglyphic's and become an Egyptologist. I do not mind having characters that are bigger than life what I object to is having the characters continuing patting themselves on the back telling you about it constantly."
3,Slightly disappointed,"As in all great literary and screen pairs, once they get married, the adventure seems to wane. Such is the case with Ramses and Nephret in the new Amelia Peabody book, ""Lord of the Silent"". I am one of Ms. Peter's biggest fans, and I admit I was aprehensive as to how life was going to continue with the Emerson clan after the wedding. Ramses's exploits were the best part of the previous books. I read, ""He Shall Thunder in the Sky"" in one sitting, and I consider it Ms. Peter's best work. But, alas, it is a difficult act to follow. One almost hopes the war gets over soon so the Emersons can have non-war-related adventures.I will, however, admit that Sennia acting like Ramses was a real hoot. My mom always said, ""Your children having kids of their own is the best revenge."" Ramses has no clue what he's getting into! Can't wait for the next installment of the series."
1,Perfunctory and boring,"There's no wit or charm here - just a plodding tale, the resolution of which comes out of nowhere, without suspense. Nothing for a reader new to this series, and precious little for the fan."
3,series is out of steam,"I have generally enjoyed this series. The plots are not always the best, but the characters and the sense of place make for a fun read. This book was more of a chore to finish, due to a rather insipid plot and the author's unsuccessful use of two points of view. The plot seemed like a redo of earlier novels in the series. The suspense and tension in the relationship between Nefret and Ramses is missing and they are just another married couple, and most of the other characters don't do anything differently than in previous novels. There is a lot of pointless activity as characters leave and arrive in Luxor and Cairo, and even some of the criminal activities in the book do not further the plot or even get resolved."
3,What Will the Future Hold.,"LORD OF THE SILENT by Elizabeth Peters has all the elements we have grown to love when following the adventures of Amanda Peabody, plus more intrigue, deviousness, and mayhem.Readers have been anticipating an end to the series as Ramses and Nefret are now untied in marriage, but fans have demanded more from this astute author.LORD OF THE SILENT brings together many of the characters and events proposed in HE SHALL THUNDER IN THE SKY. A good visit with an old friend.Nash Black, author of QUALIFYING LAPS."
4,Another strong entry in this wonderful series.,"This book is another page-turner. I so enjoy the Emersons when they are right in the thick of things. This book is a little different though because there appears to be two parallel stories at first, and the older Emersons are in Cairo following one thread, and the two younger Emersons are in Luxor following another thread. But of course they end up investigating together, and that iw when the fun begins. It's nice to see Ramses and Nefret in their newly-wed bliss. Let me tell you, Indiana Jones has nothing on our Ramses. But Emerson and his Amelia are no slouches either. We also see a new and more emotional Amelia and that is a good thing. She does her utmost to keep her son away from harm in this book and neither of them have gotten over his harrowing escape from death in the last book. But there's still lots of danger, tomb-robbing and deaths in this one and it's such a great deal of fun getting to the bottom of it with these four amazing people."
4,"buy the book, not the tape","There isn't much plot to Lord of the Silent. It's for we diehard Ramses fans who think Nefret isn't quite good enough for him, but want to see how they adjust to married life. So why the abridged audiotape cuts out every single romantic scene between the newlyweds is a mystery to me. Every lurid detail of Margaret Minton's dalliance with Sethos is included, but Ramses's heroic knife fight to rescue Nefret gets chopped (no pun intended) to bits. I enjoyed Barbara Rosenblat's performance even though her Ramses voice sounds like Prince Charles (i.e. stuffy and boring). She is wonderful with Amelia and Emerson, though. Maybe the author isn't as taken with the younger Emersons as her fans seem to be. Peters approved this abridged version. It's a dull one."
5,Amelia Peabody always entertains,"I always feel like I'm returning to an old friend when I read an Amelia Peabody novel. We know the family, we know the history, we know the settings. The writing is always good and I never miss an entry in this series!"
2,Lord of the Silent,I was very disappointed in this book. I love Elizabeth Peters. In fact I read her books over and over again. I have read Lord of the Silent twice now thinking that maybe I didn't understand it the first time. It was very slow and uninteresting. I felt it wasn't up to her usual style. I am hoping The Golden One will be much better. I loved He Shall Thunder in the Sky. I couldn't put it down. Maybe that is why Lord of the Silent was so uninteresting to me.
3,Not Peter's best but acceptable.,"In the Peabody lexicon this mystery is a bit of a let-down. It is an anti-climatic sequel (if it can be considered a sequel) to ""He Shall Thunder in the Sky"". In some respects the plot is hard to follow. One almost has to read the book staight though over the weekend (and this presuming you don't have any pressing chores or personal business to take care of) in order to make since of what is going on. BUT, at least Peabody still shows every indication that she will be with us for years to come. Unlike Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta, Peabody isn't suffering from job fatigue, burn-out or massive paranoia.Walter Amherst and Bertie Vandergelt can both stand to be more fully developed as characters. And they can certainly be given more to do as members of the cast. But it is still nice to have them around as members of the home team."
4,Great,I really enjoyed it. I am a big fan of the Peabody family and I am glad that Ramses finally won Nefrets heart. I hope she keeps writing great books.
4,Always a fantastic series to read,Not my favorite but so important for establing the personalities of the characters (as well as the marriage of Ramses and Nefret. And it includes a fantastic surprise!
5,one of my favorites in the series,"This book is great how can you not love it when it features the ""master criminal""."
3,Not quite as good as the previous book.,"I am a huge fan of Elizabeth Peters, especially this series of books. I was eagerly awaiting the book that followed the whirlwind ""He Shall Thunder in the Sky."" This book however falls flat and is probably the second worst book in the series. There is no excitement over the chase to find the culprit and when the culprit comes to light they seem to have done the crimes more because of jealousy and less because they were actually evil. The one major good thing about this novel is that the reader gets to see how the relationship between Ramses and Nefret has grown and how Peabody and Emerson are dealing with having the two of them out of the house. It'll please the most staunch fans of Peters, but for the newbies it could keep them away forever."
2,Watch out.,"Gilson, while a very good historian, was a self-taught philosopher and, as such, made a few interpretations of St. Thomas that are questionable. His metaphysics have some serious errors in relation to the Dominican tradition of Thomism (which Gilson utterly rejected). An excellent refutation of Gilson's errors are found in Tonquedec's ""La Critique de la Connaisance."" Gilson has some valuable insights, but parts of his philosophy are deeply flawed, especially his perception of philosophy as an art instead of as a science (which St. Thomas held [see hisThomas Aquinas: The Division and Methods of the Sciences (Mediaeval Sources in Translation)]."
3,I love a ghost story,"I love ghost stories, especially those which people actually believe happened. Ms Teel is no Hans Holzer, but she does tell a good tale, and these have the great good fortune of all being set in my home state of Minnesota. While some of them were already familiar to me--most notably the haunt of the Guthrie Theater--many were new. The narrative style is that of short vignettes arranged in chapters by subject: haunted houses, people, theaters, and restaurants, and mysterious phenomenon. One can carry the book with one as good ""waiting"" material, because the subject is interesting enough to keep one entertained, and the stories are short enough to set the book aside when the wait is over without feeling ""interrupted."" I took it with me to a doctor's appointment; it made me a very patient patient!"
1,"Beric the Briton, G. A. Henty published by BookSurge","The book is great. Do not buy the edition from Amazon that I bought (cover has half a blue oval on it) because it only has half the pages. Find a different edition somewhere else!Even with half the pages, the story is terrifec. Amazon doesn't seem able to police their fulfillment system. My replacement copy had the same defect, even though I requested that the shipping department check before sending it. A book with 520 pages can't be less than an inch thick."
5,Another Great Henty Novel,"Beric the Briton is the story of a young Briton during the Roman occupation of Britain. He is captured and taken as a slave to Rome where he has one adventure after another. Mr. Henty provides such rich detail in his narration that the reader gets the ""feel"" of the Roman and British cultures he is describing. The Henty books should be a mainstay of every social studies curriculum, since most students learn and retain much more history by reading historical novels than they do by working out of a dry social studies textbook. Highly recommended!"
1,Beric the Briton,"There is a printing error with this book. Both copies of the book sent to me were missing every other page. I know this is a re-issue of an older book, but can't believe the publishers missed such an error."
5,Amazing Grill!!! It really works,"I have had this grill for about a month now and I use it all the time. It really does put the flavor of your choice into the food and the food remains moist. We like well done foods especially with mad cow disease, so I make sure to over cook and the meat is tender and moist. Even smoked salmon is moist."
2,What is this?,This doesn't have a description of what songs it has. I may be interested in buying this if it was the CD I was looking for. Where is the cover art? name the songs? something
2,Disc 2 makes up for what disc one lacks.,"I am not really sure what happened with the ""In Bed With Space"" compilations. I am not impressed by any means and rather disappointed in the downward progression that I have noticed. 2 years ago, the label produced an epic look into the Ibiza perspective on ""house"" music. Lately, though it seems that things have gotten...well...a little to ""pop"" music for me. Disc one has wayyyy too many happy go lucky vocals and upbeat anthems.Disc 2 is much better in a progressive and harder sense. The entire CD is solid and makes up for the lackluster first disc.Standout tracks:-Peace control-Should be"
1,Boot Leg,"I'm really disappointed i thought i was buying a NEW dvd but instead i got a boot leg copy. To make matters worse the dvd won't play in my DVD player only on my computer. Don't get me wrong the documentary of tite curet is great but i was expecting an original copy, i could have gotten a boot leg on my own. Be careful when purchasing this item."
2,No Miracle,"Based on some glowing reviews, I was looking forward to trying this product and bought one for myself and one for my mother. I am disappoined. Just another average hand cream, certainly no miracle!"
1,I love animals too,"I love hamburgers, veal, buffalo chicken wings, ect.God, I just freakin' hate PETA and their no good self righteuos A=holes. If you don't want to eat meat then go spend your time getting stoned and telling yourself, ""geez, this sure is making my rich daddy think I'm a rebel. thats what he gets for not spending enough time with me"". For this album, its just a bunch of brainwashed lunatics with no talent making a dull and senseless album. Just look at the line-up, and thats enough to make you look away for better albums. Face it people, we have been eating meat for centuries and animals have been eating each other for milleneums, just don't protect animals that can't protect their dumb selves. Survival of the fittest and the strong will destroy the weak."
5,woodcarving basics,This book and its corresponding DVD are 2 of the best resources of woodcarving i have studies. David Sabol is remarkably understanbdable and his information is very useful for anybody who carves or wants to carve wood.
4,Nice gift,"I gave this book to my son who does wood carving. He enjoys looking through it, so it met my needs."
3,Good item with a cheap price but not all were at par.,"Very nice item with a cheap price. However, not all were at par. Some were short, some were broken, and some were not straight. The package was sealed and looked new but upon inspection of the cable ties the quality seemed lacking. I used these cable ties in my boogie board project and the ones I've installed seems to keep their tightness. None came loose sofar and none broke during installation. Only time will tell if they are durable. I hope that helps."
1,Junk- they snap like a dried pretzel stick,DOn't buy these if you want tie-wraps that actually work.. Brittle things that snap when you tighten them. Useless waste of cash
3,They get the job done.,"They're as sturdy as any other cable ties, but definitely not anything sturdier or exciting. Unfortunately I found a multi-colored pack at the 99 cent store that did just as good of a job; these are a bit overpriced."
3,zip ties,"These are ok. NOT GB, they are MONOPRICE brand. thin but I think they'll work. Its hard to say which plastic is best until its exposed to the sun for a while. I don't like receiving a different brand than what was advertised."
4,D&D Third Age,"This product was my first introduction into the universe of Babylon 5. Since playing my first game, it has caused me to immerse myself in the series, watching all 5 seasons on DVD. I find that the Babylon 5 RPG is a very interesting environment in which to play. It's rules, including a limited number of hit points and defense based on reflex saves instead of dex bonuses, as well as a very skill-heavy character cross-section, allow games to move beyond the run-of-the-mill Space Hack scenario that seems to inhabit other D20 space type games. Overall, this book is highly recommended if you are a fan of the series and have ever wanted to adventure in the universe of Babylon 5."
3,meh - works ok,"The level bubble was broken when it arrived, and to get a precise bend is difficult with half inch. But it worked for what I needed. If you are looking for cheap, this is your tool."
4,Quality product,This is well made and does the job. It's made of aluminum with built in level. Great for the price I paid. Thanks.
1,Played once then No Power,"We were excited to get this system and play again the old Nintendo games. We played one game and everything was fine. We turned it off to come back and play later. The system would not power on. We tried multiple times, gave it a rest, tried a a different known working power adapter, and a different power outlet, but nothing. It was very disappointing."
4,The NES Is Back!,"Great Fun, Play all your old favorites again. System is small (not much larger than a cartridge), and modern looking. Plays great, compatability is great, with good controllers, and onlysome very slight sound and video differences wtih some games. Recommended!!"
4,"Olaf, metal!","Great, not as good as the Mallrats soundtrack, though a damn good listen if you like Alternative music, by that I mean songs about Wookies! I agree with the guy who wants Olaf's version of Berserker on there that would be cool! Boys Against Girls are good, too. JAY'S CHANT, WOW!"
5,Ahhhhhh..... CHEWBACCA!,"With those words I knew I had to have this album. I like Alice in Chains, Stabbing Westward, Bad Religion, but I needed Chewbaca. Wookie Power!"
5,Some people don't understand,"I am getting tired of people bashing this movie by saying that it's too violent and doesn't develop the characters enough. Here's a wake up call to those people: WAR IS VIOLENT and this movie shows how violent and inhumane it can be. Most of the people who downplay this movie either don't know what happened in Somalia or don't understand the utter brutality of war. This film tells the story of what the Rangers and Delta Force in Somalia went through. It doesn't try to develop the characters because that's not what the director was trying to do. Black Hawk Down is a living tribute to the American soldiers who died in Somalia. In this case, their actions were the key focus and not the men themselves. Critics need to appreciate what these soldiers did for their country and for each other before the full potential of the movie can be seen."
3,SLAUGHTER IN SOMALIA,"SAVING PRIVATE RYAN was a brilliant film because it not only showed the horror of war, but it also let us know something about the participants. BLACK HAWK DOWN certainly reiterates the fruitlessness of war, and shows how our government was not prepared for the events laid out in this film. We sent a few men in, compared to thousands and thousands of militiament, and evidently thought they were just going to lay down their arms and surrender. This lack of vision on the US brought about a disastrous 16 hours of hell for these soldiers.Ridley Scott gives us gruesome and dynamic visions of battles, but unlike Steven Spielberg, he doesn't give us much to know about the various personalities in the film. In spite of this, some good performances are offered by Josh Hartnett, Jason Isaacs, Tom Sizemore and Ewan McGregor. Many of the other actors are lost in their anonymity.A well made but somehow empty film."
3,Intense movie that is hard to watch,"I struggled to watch this movie. It was very well done and a good movie don't get me wrong, but what those boys were put through made me feel very indignant. Why does the US military feel that it has to police every nation into treating its people better? I feel that a nation needs to work things out for themselves so that when they achieve independance and freedom, they will know the struggles that it took to gain it and they wil use it productively. imagine if during the time of American slavery, another more powerful nation came in and tried to fix it for them. America would not be as great as they are today. It is a long road to develop self determination for a nation and it must be developed on its own. I know I am digressing from the movie topic but these are the thoughts that I had as I saw this movie. The movie was very visual and very well directed. a triumph yet stil, hard to watch."
5,Black Hawk Down,"Im a 14 yr old male who is in love w/ helicopters And plan on being a pilot.So after seeing the previews,I couldnt wait to see the movie.I saw it after reading the book in less than 2 weeks and I thought it was an outstanding movie."
3,Confusing,"While I was watching Black Hawk Down, I had a considerable amount of trouble focusing on the plot (was there one?) because I could never tell who was who. Even when I watched the closing credits, some of the names of the characters I didn't even recognize. Although it had a lot of great action, that was all there was. So if you want to see two hours of gunfire, fighting, and blood, this is the movie for you, but don't expect a great story, or any story at all for that matter."
3,Black Hawk Down,"For a movie, it is good with all the bullets and RPGs flying over and around. No boring scenes at all. Audience will be caught in attention from the beginning to the end, if you like war game.But that is all. There is lack of passion or humanity as what I found in Saving Private Ryan or other great war movies. All in this movie is the Big American things. 18 US troopers died with sacrifice of over 1000 Somalians. The Amerians are died not for defending their country but for kidnapping other race leaders. In fact, Americans were losers in the battle but the movie try to make them winners in moral. But the director did not explain why the whole city, from children to women, were against Americans.If you just want to play war game, this movie is a must see. Don't expect more."
5,never received it,"we reall liked this movie, and my sons platoon had asked me to pick it up if I ran across it and I did look for it in the stores but couldn't find it so decided to order it from Amazon. Well I never received the movie or even a response to the note that I had written to the Sellers. So I wasn't happy with this one."
3,Black Hawk Down DVD,Very good movie but the DVD skipped from the first time it was put in the player and Amazon does not take back opened DVD's. Last time I will order a DVD from this company.
1,Don't Buy This DVD!!!,"Don't Get me wrong, I think Black Hawk Down Is A Great movie, but this dvd [is not good]!!! it has basicly NO extra features. However In a few months a collecters edition 2-disc set of this movie is coming out. I am waiting for that one before I buy this movie. It will be worth it!"
1,Deceptive Digital Media,"Sonypictures should be ashamed of itself. Of course it's not the first time they get criticized for deceptive marketing practices. I haven't even watched the DVD yet, but the extras...When the case says it includes ""theatrical trailers"" you expect at least one of them to be for Black Hawk Down. This thing is devoid of practically everything. If you enjoy extras, this is definitely not the way to go.In this world of digital you have no idea what you're getting until you open it. Then you can't return it. Worst of all, I can't find a real address to gripe complain directly to Sonypictures. Digital this!"
2,Something went terribly wrong!,"We had heard about this video for a long time, so ordered it. There was something ""terribly wrong"" with the planning and protection of the military that engaged in this fire fight."
2,Read the Book!,"Although this was not a bad ""action"" movie, it was a very poor translation of a book that was a fairly accurate look at a conflict that was barely noticed by most people. Everybody can recall the images of dead Americans being desecrated by the Somalis, but what the book covered was the story behind the conflict, and it's participants. What I didn't like about the movie was the combining of some characters, and the omission or downplaying of others. I didn't get a feel for any of the characters in the movie. They all seemed very thin, whereas the book fleshes them out quite a bit more. Also, the tension between the different units stationed in Somalia, not there at all. In all fairness, had the movie mirrored the book, it would have been about as long as the battle itself, with hundreds of characters, and a cast of thousands. Bravo for making an almost honest movie about an unpopular conflict, but as for me, I'd like it a little more like the book."
5,truthful movie.,"I've read through alot of good reviews here. so mine will be short. I admire the movie for being truthful about war, how the soldiers show fear, (as in life) there aren't any cheap attempts at patriotism here either. no one liners. In a sense I felt I was watching a documentary of the events that took place in 1993.the movie showed our soldiers unbelievable bravery without sugarcoating the facts. I felt a lump in my throat when the two soldiers dropped down out of the helicopter to try and save their fallen brothers, against hundreds of enemy militia. I have never seen bravery displayed on cinema in any manner like the bravery shown in this movie."
4,The (mostly) good and bad...,"To start this off, I'd like to say that in general this was an excellent movie. The only people that have given this movie 1 star was because they were anti-war fanatics and just want to downgrade war in general. This movie is very realistic for the most part, absolutely action-packed, and will have you sitting on the edge of your seat from the second that the fighting begins.On the other hand, like a lot of American war films...this movie is extremely biased towards the American side of the story, not to mention the fact that it also only focuses on the American troops fighting...and not the Pakistani and other troops helping the UN side. It also portrays the Somalis as heartless people, when they were no more heartless then the Americans fighting.All in all, it is still a great movie, I'd recommend it to anyone that isn't weak of the heart."
5,To Douglas B Cody of San Francisco,"I felt the movie was well done. The action sequences were well played out and realistic. A lot of time obviously went into the authenticity. Mr. Cody, You missed the point! When a ""civilian "" picks up a gun and starts firing at american soldiers they are not a civilian anymore, they are a combatant. You obviously haven't been in the military! I didn't see any innocent bystanders get killed in the movie! War is ugly and I think this was a pretty accurate account of this particular skirmish.Hopefully they will come out with another edition with DTS and the history channel's documentary."
4,BlackHawk Down,"The movie was surreal very much like the country and military situation of Somalia. When I first got there it was very exciting and the movie captured that. The story was told well and the tough spot the soldiers found themselves in. However, historically the worst attack was on June 5th, where 37 Peackeepers(Pakistanis and Italians) were killed and the city was just getting more, and more dangerous. Jounalists and soldiers called the place the ""Suburbs of Hell"" Excellant movie, finally some recognition."
5,One of the BEST films ever,"Black Hawk Down was one of the best movies of all time, and the very best war movie ever. Hands down. Unlike most war movies, Black Hawk Down accurately depicts US Soldiers and combat. The directing and acting were superb, and the fact that the Cast, crew, producers and director actually worked with the US military to the extent they did to make this film, shows that so much more time and energy was spent to make sure they did things right."
1,A Lie Spawned By Warmongers,"This movie is ""based on fact"", but turns out to be the biggest lie to come out of Hollywood in a long time. The truth is that US helicopters went in and murdered 100s of innocent folks and in retaliation the innocent folk fought back."
1,Sucks!!!,i had trouble with this item...they didn't ship it ...so i waited 2 weeks and the only thing they did for me was in my next purchase send it free....
2,Much ado about nothing.,"I was always curious about this movie based on all the accolades that it received. After seeing it, I'm truly sorry that I did. Discouraging and hopeless was the way it left me. I watched the ""once great"" United States get beaten again - as if going through Vietnam was not enough. This person gets shot, that person gets shot, and on and on. Usual Hollywood, shockingly graphic violence. Pointless. Not worth the least bit of my time after all. Yuck."
1,Two Thumbs Down,"A racist, simplistic, patronizing, juvenile and comic-book depiction of the USA's brief involvement in Somalia's civil war. There's no post-Cold-War context, no geopolitical analysis, and no contemplation. In fact, no brains. Just good guys and bad guys ripping each other apart with bullets and rocket-propelled grenades while screenwriter Ken Nolan and director Ridley Scott assault the audience with cliches for two and a half hours. Don't waste your time on this turkey."
2,the rewriting of history,"Of course we are all used to the fact that hollywood takes it liberties with the truth. However, this film is so much a rewriting of history it made me sick. I would have left the theatre had I not been stuck in the middle of a row. The film portrays the american troops as doing all they can to try and save the day, when in reality it was the american decision to hunt Aideed that signalled the end of earlier effective humanitarian intervention. The americans did not save the day, they created the mess. added to this the ill judget attempt at humour during the film (the lost soldiers, har har har) the story is [poor]. Sound, editing and special effects are brilliant though, and if that is what you go for, plus a lot of violence and blood (way over the top) this is for you."
4,Great movie!! - DVD needs more content,"Great movie, but the DVD doesn't have many extras to it. There is a 25 minutes behind the scenes featurette that is informative.To really explore what happened to bring these events about, read the book. It reads like a non-fiction thriller, but is based on many interviews and transcripts from the people who were on scene in Somalia."
5,Black Hawk Down,"War is [bad], and it will always be [bad] but this movie is anything but [bad]. I know that this was a real event and that people died and I mourn those who lost their lives but this movie is a MUST see. The movie features breath taking effects, outstanding sounds, and has a great overall physique. I have watched this movie 3 times at the thearters and it never gets old. If you are a person who loved ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Plat00n"", then this is the next movie you will love.To wrap all this into a couple of words... THIS IS A MUST SEE!"
2,NO TRAILER & NO COMMENTARY,"The DVD contains 2 trailers: ""Spiderman"" and ""the One.""There is no trailer of Black hawk Down. The makers of the DVD decided to use it as a comercial to advertise their other films.I happen to like trailers and I happen to like commentaries from the director. This DVD contains neither. I expected more from Jerry Bruckheimer& Co. especially since this is an important movie.The picture quality is good. The audio could be better.A Good Movie. A Poor DVD."
2,"Best Movie of the Year, on the worst DVD of the year","Hopefully Blockbuster will let me return this DVD with receipt and get a credit on the special edition when it comes out. The movie is a must see, but rent it until a better DVD comes out. I've soaked up about as much information as I could regarding this historical event. The DVD offers nothing more than a short behind the scenes featurette.Buy the book, see the movie, and don't ever forget this story. It is possibly the most important event in modern American history, and guys like Randy Shugart, Gary Gordon, Mike Durant and the thousands of other guys like them should never be forgotten.It's single minded purpose is its greatest strength. Steven Spielberg should take note of Ridley Scott's historic achievement in film making, and so should you.God bless our Armed Forces."
5,Black Hawk Down [Blu-ray],"Que bien tratada esta esta pelicula; Somalia 1992-1993,estuve ahi y mejor descripcion ninguna. Una pelicula para coleccion."
5,GREAT MOVIE,IF THE STORY IS COMPLETELY TRUE THEN BILL CLINTON SHOULD BE CHARGED WITH TREASON FOR NOT LETTING THOSE MEN HAVE ARMOR. THERE IS NO DEFENSE FOR PUTTING U.S. SOLDIERS IN HARMS WAY WITHOUT THE CORRECT TOOLS. BILL SHOULD BE ASHAMED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Don't Buy......Yet!,"Before you make the regretful mistake of buying this version of Black Hawk Down, wait for the release of the special edition 2- disc set that should be coming out soon. It has a load of extras that this one is missing. My low rating is not for the movie, however. This movie is really good with great action sequences and storyline. I would suggest you see it if you haven't. Just hold your horses and wait a bit longer for the special edition to arrive. It will be worth it in the long run."
4,The true purpose...,"Many people have said ""oh this movie had no plot"", or ""oh this movie had great action"", but that's not what this movie is about. You aren't supposed to watch this movie and then feel happy like you just watched a great comedy. This movie portrays what war is really like. After viewing this movie you should have a greater sense of respect for all of our soldiers that are fighting in any war. This is not a ""Gladiator"" or ""Braveheart"", this movie runs more along the lines of ""Saving Private Ryan"". Enjoy it for what it is."
5,"This movie is historical, not action.","To the other reviewer who gave this movie one star because it was ""all action"", I would like to respond that this movie was not meant to have a storyline like ""We Were Soldiers"". The movie was adapted from Bowden's book ""Blackhawk Down"" which gives a HISTORICAL description of events which took place in 1993.This movie is one of the most historically accurate war movies ever made, far surpassing Saving Private Ryan or even Band of Brothers. It's attention to historical detail is amazing. I'm sorry you didn't catch the story line; it was: ""We go through this for you, and you don't even bother to thank us"".My advice is not to watch this movie for entertainment (although it can certainly provide that). This is the real story of what happened to American soldiers in Mogadishu, 1993."
5,I Wad Glued To My Seat,"An intense recreation of a historic battle that made me feel like I was there and in the battle. One of the two best ""war movies"" I've ever seen."
3,Solid sound and action...but a little too long,This started off a little slow and then moves a break-neck action packed pace! The sound on this blu-ray (like most of Ridley Scotts other work) is nothing short of spectacular! Explosions and bullets whizzing throughout to keep you on the edge of your seat. This is really best enoyed on a solid 7.1 system. The picture quality was not the best i've ever seen but certainly nothing wrong with it. My only problem with the movie is that is does drag and after the 1000th straight explosion it gets a little old. The character development is also a little weak. War movies like Saving Private Ryan do much better in this regard. I would say it is worth seeing although it took me three separate viewings to finish it. I'm also not sure about the re-watchability of it as well. This seemed like a barrage of action with no real purpose or plot to hold it together. Three stars for the sound effects and effort it took to put it on the screen.
3,Not as I expected !,"I had high expectations for the Blue-ray version of this excellent movie, but I was disappointed as the picture quality was merely slightly better than the DVD version. In my first viewing I could not even tell the difference between this version and the regular DVD version that was released years ago.I cannot comment on the audio side as I am yet to test it on a 5.1 audio setup. I'd only recommend buying this disc only if you don't own the DVD version already.My HD set is 1080i if you are wondering."
3,"Great Movie, Below Average DVD",This is one of my favorite movies. I am glad I rented it before I purchased. The DVD packaging is well below average for a movie fan. The extra features are disappointing. This DVD is a rental only. Save your money for the special edition that will come out in a couple of months.
3,Too Much Battle!,"""Black Hawk Down"" is action packed and I mean packed.There is only like 30 minutes of set up and 2 hours and 1/2 of war. It is exciting at first and then it starts to get boring with all this action. I actually was begging for more talking and usually I beg for more action, but it just keeps going non-stop! There is a bloody scene towards the end which I absolutly loved. Although the movie takes too long and has too much battle that it gets boring, it still has a lot of cool action scenes and is entertaining until it gets too boring. I do recommend to anyone who has not seen it to go see it if they are planning to go see this movie."
3,Good film but remember why it happened,"Our military was sent to Somalia on a humanitarian mission by Bush 1. People were starving but we probably should have stayed out of a civil war. Bill Clinton decided to go after Aidid. The U.S. Army asked for M2 Bradley tanks as back up repeatedly. Clinton and his Sec of Defense Les Aspin said NO repeatedly.Clinton was under pressure from the congressional black caucas to not send tanks to be used against Africans. Never mind the fact that black, white & hispanic Americans lives were on the line.Al Qeada ambushed our guys. They had no tanks for back up. They were pinned down all night until we were able to get an old rickety tank from a UN country acting as peacekeepers (I think it was Malaysia) to act is back up and cover.Clinton then quickly pulled out. Bin Laden was behind this operation and Clinton's stupidity & cutting & running gave Bin Laden the confidence to launch 9-11."
2,Black Hawk Let Down,"When I flicked on my TV during sometime of the summer of 2001, I saw what looked to me as the most worthwhile looking movies of the year; Black Hawk Down. Pending its release, such comments were made as, ""Much better than Gladiator!"" ""The best war movie ever made!"" and the such. Of course, with reviews like that, who could have not seen it?Well anyways, my friend and I went to go see it on opening day. We piled ourselves into the theater along with a bunch of other action craving guys and sat down. Throughout the movie, I felt destracted by the allour of my popcorn more than what was up on the screen. I thought it was overly violent, mediocore acting, but, I must say, good action. Action alone cannot save a bad movie, so sadly I must decree that Black Hawk Down recieves two stars."
1,One of the worst Movies I have seen,"This is simply one long war scene with no character development at all.Sure, it may well portray what war is really like but that's about the sum of it. Nothing more nothing less."
2,Blood and gore,"First of all, I can't believe that the United States military would admit to making such a horrific and deadly mistake as depicted in Black Hawk Down. If this really is based off of actual events, I'm ashamed that it was made public knowledge. As for the movie just as a story - if you like blood and guts (literally) then this is just right for you. If you've got a weak stomach, skip this one. This movie gives you close-ups of severed limbs, gaping wounds, and exposed internal organs. While the story is gripping and rather suspensful (how are they going to get out of this mess?), it doesn't answer the question of how and why the mission was allowed to happen the way it did."
2,a glorified Rambo sequel.,"This film has the cinematic style and potential for a patriotic and moving portrayal of combat. However, they opted to generalize the entire battle into one confusing and objective story, rather than tell the stories of the soldiers. I can easily have my emotions stirred up by the brutal killing of a character, but not if I have no clue who he is or what he is doing. The film throws so many characters at you in such brief periods that you can't remember any of their names, let alone what kind of a people they are. Aside from the uniforms we can't tell the difference between the rebel Somolians and the U.S. military. We're not even sure if we're fighting for the right side. The filmmakers do nothing more than beat excessive violence and plight into our faces with no explanation, no distinctions, and no emotion.This film is an insult to the soldiers who actually fought that battle."
2,froze,The movie showed up on time but not in working order. Movie froze right when it starts getting good. Waste of time. Hastings has blurays same price or cheaper and guaranteed.
2,it is a tale told by an idiot ...,"this certainly must rank among the noisiest movies ever made. whether or not it has merit as a tale probably rests as much with your personal politics as anything else, but as an artistic creation (ive never been a ridley scott fan) it is little more than an updated version of superior older movies like ""battleground"". stereotypical characterizations by wooden actors, personified by the always hunky but always dull josh hartnett. full of sound & fury ..."
1,Not suitable for family viewing,"Two hours of shooting, killing and blood squirting. Not suitable for family viewing. Even though this movie may have some factual background, the storyline flatlined."
3,Disappointing,"As much as I wanted to like this movie, I have to admit that it really isn't entirely successful. I understand why Scott wanted to make the film, given that the book is powerful and influential. But Speilberg's work in ""Saving Private Ryan"" has raised the bar in war films so high that I think it is difficult to make a film that compares favorably. If this had been made several years ago, it would have made a much greater impression, especially when compared to ""Apocalypse Now"" or ""The Deer Hunter,"" which seem dated in retrospect. I wish this had been a great film, because it is about the men who are out there _right now_ fighting Al Qaeda, but it is not a great film or even a particularly engaging one."
3,Pure senseless shooting,"This movie is good if you want to excite your five senses. great sound and nice setting. other than that, it is just pure senseless shooting. Many violent and gory scenes. not for the faint hearted. Overall, a war show that can be made better."
3,"Not the best war movie, but a good one.","I've found that after seeing ""Saving Private Ryan,"" that I have been dissensitized to all violence. Therefore I found nothing surprising about this movie. However, it is still very good with some nice sequences, but it's still not as good as even ""We Were Soldiers."" It's a very dusty movie, and the dirt never completely clears out."
4,Do some homework!,"I suggest everyone do some homework regarding the events that lead to this black eye in US Military history. Like Vietnam, Operation Restore Hope is a perfect example US Political leaders using our most valued resource (our sons and daughters) to gain favor with the electorate or foreign countries. The blame starts at the top and ends with Gen. Garrison. For their mistakes and miscalculations America lost 19 brave and honored souls. What a waste!Suggested reading: Col. David Hackworth's About Face and Hazardous Duty"
3,"""Into the mouth of Hell.........!""","When I saw ""Black Hawk Down,"" I found my self grimmacing and becoming unnerved. This film has THE most realistic battle scenes ever committed to film. They put everything into this one: graphic war scenes, confusion of war (you hardly knew where you were), friensdhip and comraderie, and the overall sense of sadness that this actually happened.The DVD is nothing to praise. All it has on it are talent files, trailers for ""Spider-Man"" and ""The One,"" and a production featurette! Great Film, Average DVD! Movie Grade: A (4 Stars); DVD Grade: C+ (3 Stars)."
5,Great!,"This DVD is excellent. The sound is supreme, the acting is excellent, the action is nonstop and the story line is true. Great movie. In fact, there isn't a slow part in the whole movie.I love America and the people who put their lives in harms way each and every day so that we may have our freedoms."
3,Best Sound Oscar? Not on this DVD,"While I think the movie is a great technical experience and one of the most stressful (in a good way) pictures I've ever sat through, I must say I was very disappointed in the sound on this special edition disc, which isn't right, since this won the Oscar for best sound editing.First of all, it's a crime that there wasn't a DTS track on the disc with the feature, but the 5.1 mix just isn't up to snuff. There was very little feeling of ambient sound and the mix was largely centered in the front speakers. There are occasionally some sounds that zip by in the rear speakers, but I was not impressed, and thought the disc makers really glossed over something that I would vastly improve the experience of this film.That being said, it's a great flick and I haven't had time to go through all the extras, but I'm looking forward to it, especially the Frontline documentary and the Ranger commentary."
1,Read the Book Instead (or at least read it first),"This movie is just another typical, Hollywood, special effects blockbuster with no substance to back it up. You see a bunch of soldiers running around shooting, but the movie gives almost no story about who they're shooting at, where they're running to or why things went so terribly wrong on this ill fated mission.Mark Bowden's book is a gripping tale of American heroism in the face of overwhelming odds and an honest documentary of a battle most of us barely noticed on the six o'clock news. It's a shame so much of this was lost in its translation to the big screen."
2,Propaganda Posing As Something Glorious,"This film is the longest recruitment ad for the Marines I have ever seen. In this modern world of media and warfare, interventions like this are more complex, but they have been oversimplified to side with U.S. objectives. There have been thousands of innocent people killed in other countries (South Africa, Bosnia, China), why do you think America singled out Somalia for assistance?...If you really want to see a good movie about the complexities of modern warfare where tragedies ensue when people try to give assistance, see ""No Man's Land"" directed by Danis Tanovic. This film shows how affecting military intervention can be from several different perspectives. It does so without the usual big-budget Hollywood treatment, so those of you raised on Go U.S.A. Rambo-style action sequences maybe bored."
2,What's all this hooplah about?,"Personally, Black Hawk Down did nothing for me. I'm a fan of war movies, don't get me wrong. From a war film perspective, this movie is an accurate portrayal of combat in modern times. You can't deny that. From that standpoint, the movie is good. It's the other aspects of a good film that are missing. This movie is a 2 and a half hour gun fight. That's it. No character development, no real ending, it just kind of ended. Personally I think we're all so caught up in post-September 11 patriotism that we want to see a bunch of people we don't care about get the living crap shot out of them just so we can feel good about our American superiority. Gimme a break. You want to put out a war movie, at least give it more substance than two hours of Saving Private Ryan-ish combat. At least Private Ryan was good."
2,More american patriotism,"Another sadly american film, this film attempts to tell the truth but ends up glamorising american soldiers and failed american foriegn policy.Briliant cinema, but again the message is blurred to suit the american box officeIt is a real shame that none of the film makers these days have the guts to tell it how it really is."
2,"The acting was great,,,but.....","A little blood and guts goes a long way. I tried to look at this film with an open mind and tried to see what the director was trying to get across to his audience. If he was going for ""shock value"", than he did his job. If he was going for entertaining,,,,he failed.When i go to the movies or buy a DVD i like to be entertained. I'm a proud American and would do ANYTHING for my country. I don't need to see a film that has so much pain. Granted war is hell and i know what it is like to lose a friend(s) to war. But why do we have to be constantly reminded of this type of sadness throughout a movie.The acting is really well done and i don't say that lightly because if you read my reviews i'm pretty harsh on non-broadway trained actors. But the acting in this film was quite wonderful but the director could have gotten his point across without the terrible gore and pain. For acting i give this 5 stars, for directing i give it only 2. Sorry."
2,It's not HD.,It's just a DVD on a Blu-Ray carrier. National Geography in HD is much better than this movie. And that's even in 720. Not 1080.The movie itself is excellent.
3,Blu-ray is not for this !,"This is a good film, but the video is not a pleasure to watch in blu-ray. Grain, bad contrast, bad colors. If this is what the director wanted, like some people say, so we could stay with the DVD. Talking about DVDs I saw The Hurt Locker in DVD ... an excellent new war film, about bombs disarmers. Great video quality in DVD ! In Blu-ray if they make a good transcription the video will be GREAT !!!"
3,Zulu revisited,"Many years ago, the British made a film called Zulu where thousands of Zulu tribesmen rushed at a camp and were shot down by about 100 British soldiers.The same effect occurs here. The Americans are surrounded. The weapons are stronger, but the effect is just the same. THe Americans are people while the Somalis are not. The American soldiers die in pain - often in slow motion - and they are named in the credits. The Somali soldiers just get shot or blown up and we are told that 1000 died compared to 19 Americans.The Americans are depicted as brave, while the Somalis are shown as maniacs.Nonetheless, there is a lot to like in this film with some creat action scenes. The fight scenes are well done.THe film has no real centre, after the carnage, there is one scene at the end when a man dimly walks across a road with his dead child, there is no vision that this war may be destroying all involved in it. In the end, it is a film that has very divided sympathies and does not work as a whole."
4,A little to much blood and guts,"The movie it's self wasn't much and the quality of the Blu-ray was okay but, not impressive."
3,Cheesy American accents,"Good movie;not Great like Saving Private Ryan or Band of Brothers;but good.One thing I couldnt get past were the cheesy American accents used by the many;and I mean many British and Australian actors(Ewen Bremner,Ewen Mcgregor,Eric Bana,Orlando Bloom,Jason Isaacs;and many more)Cmon,How hard is it to cast American actors to portray American soldiers?I would have given this movie atleast a 4 star had I believed I was watching American soldiers in action instead of Australians and Brits dressed up as American soldiers."
5,NON-STOP Action!,"This an excellent movie. The choreography and cinematography were excellent! Ridley Scott is at the top of his directing skills in this awesome action film. All the actors delivered excellent perfomances, and the movie was plain out awesome! It has the real-life look of Saving Private Ryan. Top reccomendations!"
3,Good documentary,"Lots of good first-hand information. Nothing riveting, but worth a couple dollars to see it and get a few more details than you had before."
3,Essentials edition is NOT the same DVD,"Movie is 5+ stars.Essential DVD version is 3 stars due to missing special features.This review in on the ""essentials"" edition. The extras included are not the complete set that is on the original blu-ray DVD. Specifically the History Channel documentary is not included. I ordered the regular blu-ray version and got the ""essentials"" version (sold by third party but through amazon so I got the 2 day prime shipping). I got it quick, in one day actually. I searched for about 30 minutes trying to see if the ""essentials"" version had the HC Docu on it before I opened the disc and couldn't find anything specific saying that it did NOT have it. Wal-mart actually says it does. Well, it doesn't. I went ahead and opened it and verified that it doesn't have the HC docu. I paid 13 bucks for it and I'll find someone with a blu-ray and liked the movie and just give it to them while I search a retail store locally to find the regular blu-ray version."
3,Its War...,This movie hasnt delivered the story is ok but it doesnt satisfying and deeplike other films the picture quality is great especially the actionscenes withall that mud and particles flying arround great sound too.good but not great or perfect movie.
3,ehhh..,"I admit for the situation the movie is depicting it's hard to say that I didn't care. I respect the situation, and the men who put their lives on the line. But this movie was all action. Which can be good....if you give a damn about any of the actors. I seriously didn't care about any of them. A little bit more character development would've been nice."
3,Muddled and average,"I went to see this at the cinema and thought it was excellent. I then read the book and bought the DVD and loved it less. In fact each time I watch it, I like it a little less. Maybe because the book was so much better (probably because the book didn't have to be condensed into 2 hours).I found certain battle scenes to be confusing, sometimes with no idea what soldiers I was watching. Plus the movie moves away so far from the truth at times that it becomes more or less fiction.I like Ridley Scott, the movie is well-made and the extras are informative and entertaining but it does lack something."
4,"Great movie, average disc","This movie, like most Ridley Scott films, is awesome. I cannot say enough about how good it is. My only gripe is that there is no director's commentary audio track. The transfer is beautiful, the 5.1 Dolby Digital is flawless. Be warned: This movie is more graphic than any other war movie I have ever seen and it does not have that feel good hollywood ending."
5,The Best DVD Release For A Great Movie,I'm a Huge Fan of Ridley Scottand this movie is Really AmazingIt Tells the Story of what happened in Mogadishu in October 1993The Acting Is Great And The music By Hans Zimmer is FANTASTICThis DVD Contains a 150 mins documentary about making the moviethe dvd also contains deleted scenesThe Video And Audio Quality Is AmazingBuy It If You Are A Fan Of War Movies
5,A true honest depiction of modern war,"This is a life changing film. I always wondered what would motivate an individual to be in a battle field situation and fight when he or she has a choice not to be there in the first place. Yes patriotic feeling and love for your nation would motivate you to do it. But looking at today's war in Iraq no one would think young soldiers sacrificing their life are defending America because it is no threat to America. This film tells you ""its all about the man besides you"". Military creates a situation where soldiers are put in the middle of war zone and they fight because even if they don't the enemy is going to.Very true and thought provoking film. Salute to all the real heroes who sacrificed their life in mogadishu, and to the director for not making and overly dramatic film and being honest in telling the story."
3,black hawk down,"i enjoyed this movie although i wouldent see it a secound time, this is one of those movies you don't reget seeing one time. but not on my list of collectables."
4,accurate picture of modern day urban warfare,"This movie seems to be a portrayal of the modern day soldier's esperiences in war being fought in urban settings. A real eye opener for those of us who still think of war in the terms of WWII and other wars of that era. This is exciting, eye opening and frightening all at the same time. Definitely not recommended for a bed time story or for young children. It contains the story of war and all that goes with fighting a war."
4,And The Oscar Should Of Gone To:,"Black Hawk Down. What can I say? This movie is flawless. Absolutley flawless. Maybe better than Saving Private Ryan. You have to admit, Saving Private Ryan was great, but Black Hawk Down is greater. People that say say Black Hawk Down isn't good, Your not right in the head. Everyone in this move is awesome. From Josh Hartnett to Ewan mcGregor. I have a note to Josh Hartnett, Keep up with the war movies Josh. Pearl Harbor might not have been good, but he was good in it. Before I get off the subject lets talk about the movie. The two hour strait fighting scenes are good. The acting is good. The sound is good. The special effects are good. What's there to talk about? This Movie comes out on DVD on June 11. See the friken movie. You won't be angry."
4,The Intensity of Battle,"Black Hawk Down was an excellent movie portraying a disaster, from an American perspective, that occurred during our time in Somalia.Harnet is believable in his role. The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat. Mass mayhem and bloodlust of those seeking to destroy an American convoy which at first was sent to kidnap a Somalian VIP, then attempting to save the crew of a downed Black hawk helicopter.If this was a very true account, so many more of the people of Mogadishu died in this battle. America lost too many men for the goal that they originally had. Can we learn anything from this? Maybe we need to always have a clear goal with all factors supporting the effort."
4,A great sounding non-DTS DVD.,"Of course the movie was great. But those with home theaters would wish it was available in DTS. No worry, the audio is great. The sound effects has an almost Saving Private Ryan effect.The special features though is where the DVD comes short."
1,i wish i could have just listened to the music,"the whole time i watched this movie, i wanted to shut my eyes and just listen to the songs in the background....that is litterally how horrible this movie is. it lacks everything in a good movie but gore and gunfire, which is highly repetitive throughout the movie. the plot is simply too confusing, the characters unidentifiable and dislikable, all is just a mass of frames set together to make a seemingly ""good"" film, yet i was greatly dissapointed."
2,Unaccurate account of the event.,"This movie is in no way a accurate accounts of the US conflict in somalia, it over simplifies the the reason for the conflict and protrays the somalians as ""terrorists"" and the UN peace keeping troops as scum. When looking at this movie from a action movie standpoint it's okay, but looking at it from any other angle and it's mere propaganda.If you want action without accuracy or realism, then this movie is for you."
1,Disappointment,"I just have to say that this movie was an absolute disappointment. I love war movies; in fact, they are my favorite genre. And I've seen them all. But this one lacks substance. It is a war movie for the sake of gore. If there is a plot to it, it is lost behind the overkill of the blood, gore, dismantled bodyparts, etc. I strongly recommend seeking viewing pleasures outside this movie."
1,Black Hawk Down,This is a movie without a story - just another taste of hollywood slapstick blood and guts without any real purpose - but of course that may be exactly what the director is trying to put accross - the futility of American foreign involvement!
1,Black Hawk Fails,"First this movie fails to give me the reality of what happened. I am into some war movies and this was not a good one. It drugged on and on and on and I had to make myself watch it after turning it off so many times. This is a real downer- you are better of watching Full Metal Jacket.Second, this movie act as if no other minorities fought. I was disappointed to see only a few minorities. Always making it about white men dying...whatabout the rest.RENT THIS MOVIE. Then again, you may want to wait until it is on a rack for $$$- then again you may just want to save your money."
1,Enough is enough,Don't everybody think that we already have enough of this war film stuff especially after 9.11? i do believe that we deserve a better diversion than war films after the WTC attack ! i just hope that this patriotism or whatever be stopped because definitely this will not be a good example of patriotism to our children !
2,Overrated,"This movie had no story line and it was extremely confusing to follow the charecters. The effects looked pretty fake as well. I was extremely surprised since it got good reviews, but overall i would not recomend it."
2,this is just what i feel after watching it...,"Yes, I have to admit that black hawk down is a good action movie, but its not a good war movie. Protraying patriotlism and showing how Americans soldiers being passionate even at war! Ridley Scott tried to show the humane side of the soldiers while they killed 1000 somerlies in one night?! This is so contradicting. Why didn't he at least film one part showing what the somerlies suffered? I feel so disturbed after watching the movie, partly due to the selfish directing of Scott, and also because I feel sorry for the thousands of somerlies kids and women who lost their father and husbands in this incident."
3,A perfect chicken rice,"One of the finest chicken rice the Sticky has ever tasted has got to be at the small restaurant on River Valley Rd, Singapore. The chicken itself is tender and juicy, cooled to perfection, and sits on a layer of fresh tomato and cucumber slices. The soya-oil braising is subtle, not overdone, and zesty to the point of making me break down and cry. The rice is rich with chicken stock flavours, and nicely gareng. The broth is a sublime touch, cutting finely through the richness of the entire dish. The ginger and chilli mixture makes me weep...This is one of Josh Hartnett's favourite dishes, and proved to be the motivating force for his performance in Black Hawk Down. He fought bravely, knowing all the while that back home a perfect chicken rice would be his. Now that's dedication to rice!"
3,Good action flick but little else,"The action is fast paced, tense and dramatic. Which is good. However there was not enough character development which reallylets the movie down. In that sense it felt more like a dramatisation than a movie. The actors were ok but no oscar nominations."
1,Disappointing,"Had our regrettable experience in Somalia never occurred, this movie would never have received the undeserved accolades it's gotten. Reviewer Robin Bell recommends reading the book to appreciate the movie. Absent that information the lack of plot, background, and character development leaves no more than a confusing melange of battle scenes, albeit presented sharply and with crystal clear sound."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This is the worst war movie ever made, that's if you're not a soldier already and buy into this [bad stuff]. Ridley Scott directed this like it was an episode of Miami Vice. Quick cuts, so-so soundtrack and some action scenes do not make a movie good... DON'T BUY INTO THIS MYTHY. Plus take into account this is a story about the worst military exercise in our nations history. The Mogadishu ATTACKS were the worst planned attacks ever. If you want to feel patriotic go buy Full Metal Jacket or Apocalypse Now. These war movies have been made by two of the best directors of our time. Don't waste your money buying Black Hawk Down..."
1,only movie this film student ever HATED,"This was the worst film I have ever seen. Not only did the absence of plot and character depth fail to involve me in the action, I became so bored that I actually started daydreaming about other things to entertain myself while I was sitting in the theater. I almost fell asleep becasue the sound of bullets was so rhythmic as to become soothing. The film shows no concern for non-Americans, and the whole thing plays like a shooting gallery game at the state fair: set 'em up and knock 'em down. It was the most shallow, degrading thing I have ever put myself through, and I caution anyone but the most carnage-loving fan to stay as far away from this film as possible."
1,One BIG Lie,"Financed by Pentagon, this film turns out to be a propaganda movie for the US Army. The sensitivity for other cultures and politics ends where it started: in front of tv which is creating nothing but illusions. My advice: don't let yourself be manipulated"
1,Nothing to this one,"This is truely a boring movie. Yes it is all action, shooting, shoooting shooting, but there is absolutely nothing interesting. The scenes are not really well thought out, and the characters are so superficial. I can't recommend this movie to anyone."
2,Buyer Beware,"This is a movie that won Best Sound at the Oscars this year, and this disc does not feature a DTS soundtrack. Wait for the special edition whenever it comes out. Ridley Scott has done special editions for his last two movies, Gladiator and Hannibal, and there is no reason why he will not for this movie. This movie will sound dynamic in DTS, if you have the patience and means, I highly recommend you wait for the better version."
3,Amazing Movie. So So Blu Ray,"This movie is a classic, but the Blu Ray isn't necessarily so. Its only a mild improvement over the SD version. If you already own the SD version, I might recommend you not upgrade, unless you find a good deal."
3,False history movie........,"Although the movie is quite good,But the storyline totally against the true history.The real story at the end part is ""Malaysia"" armiesrescue this silly ""America"" armies. Without the helpof Malaysia armies, sure this [people] are killed."
3,"Great movie, poor HD encode","First off, I want to state that I am format neutral, so please don't accuse me of being a HD fanboy when I offer up criticism of MPEG-2. Black hawk down is a great movie, and one of the few HD titles I purchased after already owning the SD release. However, with the exception of my comcast HD, I have never seen content that is this poor. Previous benchmarks for poor quality were the HD DVD releases of The Fugitive, Goodfellas, and the Italian Job. The visual quality of this movie set that bar even lower, and I fully fault MPEG-2 for this. Compression artifacts were evident in black areas, and grain was apparent as well.My reference system is a Westinghouse LVM-37w3 (1080p) with a PS3 via HDMI for blu ray, and an HD-A1 via HDMI for HD DVD. Audio is through an Onkyo receiver with Cambridge SoundWorks speakers."
2,Disappointing,"I am a huge fan of war movies and from the previews of the movie I thought this would be good. However, I was not very impressed at all. ""Black Hawk Down"" had good production and good depictions of war in general but it was lacking in scripting and acting.The script just was not all that good and the movie failed to have much of a plot. It just seems that this movie focused to much on just one fragment of the plot and never seemed to move on to something different. In general not much really went on in this movie it was just revolving around the same thing over and over. The acting was not all that great either. I was not impressed with Josh Hartnett in ""Pearl Harbor"" and I definitely was not impressed with him in ""Black Hawk Down"". This movie failed to give me the enjoyment and excitement other great war movies has like ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Platoon"", and ""The Patriot."" This could have been a great movie but the plot and script was generally just to boring to accomplish that."
2,"As a movie, sure...","I watched this a few days after watching the 2 hour documentary on the History channel, and it didn't compare at all to the real story. Want to really have your eyes opened? Watch the documetary. I loved it, and I hate documentaries!"
4,About this DVD edition...,"If you have a region-free player, rather consider buying the South Korean superbit deluxe edition. Instead of the commentaries on disc 1, you get fabulous DTS sound. Discs 2 & 3 are identical to this edition but you get a fourth disc with the South Korean edition, being the soundtrack on CD.The movie itself rates 5 stars."
3,Shoot 'em up!,"This is at best a single dimensional movie with very little to offer other that more obfuscation of American foreign policy.Very little characterisation and not even the full facts! As action movies go, this one would surely make John Wayne proud!Nice gross, pity about the movie!"
4,Ridley Scott does it again!,"Some may call it action with no acting, some may say it uses patriotism to make it better than it really is, but the truth is that Black Hawk Down is a gripping and realistic war movie that truly makes you feel like you are in it.The movie follows a group of American elite forces who are on a routine mission in Mogadishu, Somalia. But when two Black Hawk helicopters are shot down behind enemy lines, all hell breaks loose. The first half hour of the movie is basically the acting part, but from then on it's pure action. The movie manages to convey emotions even in the heart of non-stop action, and is truly an awesome war movie. The camera work is genius, and action fans as well as war movie fanatics will be tremendously pleased. Ridley Scott has just about cemented himself as one of the greatest directors of this time with this movie. A truly epic movie!"
3,Taking a page from Disney DVD...,"While the Black Hawk Down movie is compelling, I am upset that the DVD contains no real special features. There is no directors track, no interview from the military, etc. There is a 30 minute 'making of' type of feature, but for me it provided little added value.My guess is that after waiting for a significant number of people to purchase this first release, they will turn around and release some 'collectors' or 'limited' edition. I think these 'Disney' like marketing tactics are sleazy, so I will not but this DVD. Save your money and go rent it."
4,A sea of violence and swearing,"That's right, tons of war violence(which is expected), and LOADS of f words. But that doesn't mean it's a bad movie, it's just not for the kiddies. Anyway, good flik.Grade=B"
3,Whats so good about it?,Another Hollywood war movie. Yes the movie is great in some ways in showing the full nature of the event but then there is that main character who is the worst actor I have ever seen. Why does every war related movie have to put one of these Top Gun kinda guys in there? This movie is definetely a need to see but unless your one who can ignore the bad acting it might be quite painful.
2,Ho Hum,"After a boring intro, the rest of the film is one long battle scene. While the film had the potential to make a strong comment on the futility of war, it turned out to be a showcase for special effects and noisy set pieces.This is a classic example of a film that favors style over substance. For die hard war movie fans."
5,The Best War Crime Movie of the Year!,I first saw this movie in a little town with my buddies. We had no idea what it was about and what was going to happen in it.We had a big suprise. We all came out of that movie theatre stunned and completely water eyed. My friend turned to me and asked did that really happen. I said yes. Everyone of us could not sleep that night at all. I could not believe how horrible that was for our own men to survive such a horrid place with horrible people. But I have to say that it was done very well and it was a real good war crime movie that everyone has to see to know whathappened that day our men were alone.
2,I wonder,"if my memory does not betray me, there were foreign forces involved in helping the US soldiers. Yet somehow ridley scott did not potray this aspect in this film. of course hollywood will always potray the half truth to the American audience, so that in the end any US military involvement in foreign land will not be questioned by the tax payers."
2,No fun,"This is probably the most realistic depiction of war I've seen. The explaination of the battle plan was clear enough, but after things start to go wrong, it was easy to lose track of the action. Blood and gore is abundant. There is little character development, hence it is difficult to truly care about any of them. It was not my idea of a fun evening."
2,"Too Real, and too long","I am a fan of war movies and this I wouldnt call a war. A mere skurmish. You cant help but fell patriotic as you watch this movie and want to squash the villans and enemies, but his movie just doesnt end. The action doesnt start until you are about 45-60 minutes into the movie. It good too much hype, and it was a total let down for me."
4,History about what we didn't see,"Black Hawk Down reveils the American stand off in Somalia during the Gulf War. This movie has a great cast of characters that will keep your eyes glued to the screen... Along with the action. The only reason why I did not give this movie a 5 star, was due to the story jumping around a bit to much, but still a great movie to own."
5,awesome movie,One of the best way movies ever. Great depiction of the situation our troops went through in Somalia. The acting is fantastic and real. You want to see it over and over again.
4,Blood And Bullets but Excellent,"If you've ever wonder what someone looks like when they are blown apart by a rocket, this is a good dipiction. The movie itself is excellent, they kept very true to the actual events upon which the movie was based, however it is quite gory. Josh Hartnett was excellent in Pearl Harbor but he really tops himself in Black Hawk Down! Aside from the blood and guts, which to all men, the majority of your girlfriends and wives will not appreciate~some however don't mind~this movie is really worth seeing, to those who are not weak stomached of corse! Buy it, watch it, enjoy it!"
1,To Eager to Please the American People,"This was a movie that was created to be the most PC and pleasing movie of the year. THe characters were unbeleivible, with stupid antics to make shots at jokes during the movies. THe main character was the perfect boyscout who loved all races and was there to save lives, i dont doubt that the men and women in service do this but he was just too much the perfect human being without any faults. The movie was also too repetitive, i would of loved to pay 1/4 the price and have seen 30 mins, but instead it seemed they took thirty minutes of footage and put it on a loop."
1,Worst Movie Made,This Movie is terrible...I paid good money to see it in the theater..and I'm telling you people who read this dont waste your money buying this crap...it not even worth your time. It shows how bad the US Army screws up and it shows how our tax money is spent on stupid fighting in a country we have no business being in. Please dont waste your money on this.
4,So many unanswered questions,"Well I'm sure most people are familiar with the plot. However, to give a cursory overview the movie covers a US military operation in Somalia in which heavy casualties were inflicted on both sides of the war. The movie progresses at a fast pace with gripping action and excellent acting. The viewer feels embedded in the heart of the conflict and truly develops a feel for what the soldiers must have experienced.However the movie is missing some critical elements. Lip service is paid to the political motivations behind the military operations. Scant attention is paid to how US military officials could have so grossly underestimated enemy resources. I'd recommend the movie to anyone looking to see a great action film. However, if you're looking for a deeper understanding of what went on, you'll have to look at other sources."
5,Close to the actual events,"...This movie tries to depict the operation, the dangers, and the violence of the situation that these soldiers were in. Sorry if it wasn't a bloodless, antiseptic news story. It sticks close to the actions as described in the book, and it doesn't try to change the facts to make it more palatable for those that think that these kinds of conditions don't exist. Cudos to Ridley Scott for being faithful to the events, and the people, involved in this story."
5,Black Hawk Down,I just got home from the movies and could not go to sleep. My prayers goes out to my fallen conrades and those that survived. I know some of the fellows that served in somalia. I think you did an outstanding job by releasing this movie about the past military experience. I feel history should not be left untold.
2,Great cast and gripping story but too much war,"I love war movies, I will admit. Whether it is Saving Private Ryan or one of the many war film starring John Wayne, there has always been something special about going to the limit and making sacrifices for what you believe in. But this movie was just too much of that.People say that the first ten minutes or so of Saving Private Ryan is intensive and ultra-graphic. And they would be right. About 85% of Black Hawk Down is at the same level of intensity and graphic depiction. It is almost like a rollercoaster ride from hell. It left me somewhat dazed at the end.Having said that, I thought the cast was wonderful. The characters were colorful and managed to each stand out in the midst of hellish wave of war imagery bombarding your eyes and mind.All and all, not a bad film but not an exceptional one. Less beating about the head and shoulders with the imagery stick and I think it would have been an exceptional one."
3,"War Porn, overcompensation for lack of a decent plot","This one was hard core war porn- lots of violence surrounded by little or no plot to speak of. I suppose that's what real war stories are, but the movie left me cold and disturbed. I wouldn't really recommend this one, the pacing is erratic, the characters are fairly shallow and poorly developed, and the editing makes you nauseous. There are far better war flicks out there."
2,Where are the Somalis ?,"This movie claims to be realistic, but realism would imply at least that real Somali actors play the part of the Somalis, not people from (seemingly) West Africa. It feels like we're in Sierra Leone or Liberia, and it looks like those dreadful westerns of the 50's were the Indians were played by anybody but real Indians. Maybe someone will one day be able to tell this story properly."
1,great movie - BUT GO BUY THE 3 DVD SPECIAL EDITION,"Black Hawk Down is brilliant filmmaking by one of the industry's greatest directors. Instead of this early release with a short ""featurette"" go get the AMAZING three DVD version which explores all aspects of the film."
3,"Good Vitues, strange location","This movie delivers a lot of good virtues any american (& non-American) soldier must have, but I have some observes about the location, there was a somali taxi driver praying ""Salat Al-Maghreb"" (Sunset prayer) he was facing the ocean and the sun was there, but how?!!! Somalian coast (in the South where the capital is) faces E/SE so who brought the sun there!!??That will lead Us that it (coast) was facing W/NW, and if watch the movie again we`ll notice the the streets` signs show the word ""Zanka"" and that how Moroccan calls ""Street"", so according to what I noticed the Location was Morocco (or Maybe Mauritania) not Somalia, so Mr.Director why don't you be frank with us and refer to the location?"
2,Don't waste your time,This is one of the worst war movies ever made. The typical quick shot camera angels and very bad cinematography make this the worst display of an actual event ever on film. If you want to see a great war movie go rent Coppola's Apocalypse now Redux. It's based on the Vietnam War but is by far the best war movie ever made (well next to Saving Private Ryan). The only good thing about Black Hawk down is that it shows us folks in our late 20's what was going on while we were party and going to grunge concerts.
1,What?,"What, those soldiers killed over five hundred villagers, including women and children, in a FOREIGN, INDEPENDENT country, and now they are heros in a movie?"
3,"Great book, confusing movie.......","I saw this film at an advance screening and found myself confused at who was who, who died, who survived, etc... FACT: Ridley Scott is not and has never been a good action director. He has a nice, slick, Hollywood style, but he cannot direct action scenes very well. The battles come off as just random acts of violence with choppy editing and confusing characters that all look alike... Black Hawk Down is overproduced and lacks any heart at all... PS: Black Hawk Down- I will give credit where it's due and there are some cool shots of the choppers coming into to city before the assault..."
4,Good movie,"I really enjoyed this movie, the action sequences (which are basically the entire movie) were very tense and entertaining. But as most other reviewers have mentioned, the gore is quite abundant. I mean, I can handle watching a guy pick up his hand and put it in a pocket in his pants (barely), or even watching half of a man die a sickeningly painful death, but the scene in which two men reach inside a soldier's leg to do surgery without even wearing gloves and the camera zoomed in utterly disgusted me. It's just a movie, but I feel they crossed the line with that one scene. I guess that's the way it is sometimes, but damn man, not everyone likes that stuff. But this is still an excellent war movie, and that's all it is, a war movie. Don't expect great plot or character development, but don't expect not to be entertained. For mature audiences only, and not all mature audiences."
4,Been there done that,"Wonderful movie only gave it 4 stars because I have seen saving private Ryan and it was done slightly better.This is a very realistic view of war. Should we help people just because they need help, or should we just let them wipe themselves out? Would it do any good to kill the persons responsible for starting the war if most of the population had rather fight the war than grow crops to feed themselves, even going so far as to not let people have food given to them because an outsider was delivering it.Maybe in the next war we can just go and get the sane people out of the country and let the people who are left finish their war. :,("
4,great movie,"Black Hawk Down is a movie that realistically portraits the Rangers and Delta soldiers in Somalia. It's an ensemble cast (something like 35 speaking roles) that acts well and feels genuine. Ridley Scott does a great job making this movie. The man has made some of the greatest movies (Blade Runner, Alien) and Black Hawk Down lives up to his previous works. There is also a haunting score from Hans Zimmer. The set design is so realistic that I can't believe it didn't win an award for its production design. It's a great movie, and it is no surprise to find Jerry Bruckheimer as one of the producers.It does fall a little short as a dvd. There is no commentary, and really no special features outside a short documentary on the film. But even without fully realizing the capabilities of dvd, the movie itself makes it worth buying."
1,Black Hawk Down,I have been in the military. I found the story line hard to believe. The acting was poor. I would never watch it a second time. The person who told me it was wonderful was a hardcore military type. He must have been seeing something different then I saw. I like military films for the history. I did not find this movie to have any redeeming value.
1,Blu-Ray Review,Amazon why wont you let me post my review?This Blu-Ray is not any better than the 3 disc edition picture quality wise.
1,Racist Movie,This movie is about going into a country that has nothing to do with us and killing lots of people in the process.Every single person that saw this movie said that it reaked of racism and hatred...This movie was released to try to weigh people's opinion about the us going into Somalia and killing somemore innocent people.Well guess what...It didn't work and many people saw it for what it was.Let's not forget that we bombed the only medicine factory in Somalia and now lots of people are dying because of it.Save your money and get something that's not full of hatred and racism against non-white people!!!
2,Just shooting,"Black Hawk Down hasn't got an interesting story on offer. When a bunch of marines is stranded in Mogadishu, Somalia all hell breaks loose as militants start attacking them. From there it is just angry men running and shooting. Although this is what you would expect from a war movie, Black Hawk Down remains way below average. I think this movie could have done better with some obvious main characters. Now you barely get a chance to start caring about what happens to the soldiers. Now you have so many qualified actors doing nothing but firing guns. As this movie was based on events that truly took place, probably Americans will appreciate Black Hawk Down a little more. (SARR)"
2,boring,didn't get into it; nothing engaging here; movie didn't make me interested at all; characters boring; turned it off after 30 minutes
2,Black Hawk Down a.k.a. The Moroccan Sunset,"To the east of Mogadishu is the Indian Ocean and to the west is the African continent. In this movie, sunrise and sunset are both to the east. DOH! Never mind detail blunders like a 50 caliber gun shown closeup as an M60, or the C2 Blackhawk shown by Orion surveillance above as a Huey, or the Somali mobs shown at high noon while Hoot's Humvee is shown at late afternoon at the same time, most people would not notice. They can fool us with pyrotechnics here but not with celestial bodies."
3,Not what I was looking for.,"I was hoping that oversized meant heavy duty, too. The chair is nice but, only rated to 250 lbs. That piece of informaton was not in the description, so I was disappointed with my purchase."
4,Fairly sturdy,I ordered 2chairs for my son to use for soccer season. They fold up pretty well and are fairly sturdy. They did use the heating packet for one game and found it stayed warm long enough.
1,Poor Quality,Disappointed >> strap was shredded and this is a gift>> heat pack can only be used once
5,Cable Ties Worked Great,"I purchased these ties to secure electrical cables on a solar panel installation I have. I wanted something that would hold up to ourdoor conditions and sunlight, so I chose these. So far they are working great."
4,Straus draws on feminist critique to reread Dostoevsky.,"This book demonstrates what difference it makes for our overall vision of Dostoevsky if we take his writings about women seriously. Straus leaves us with new questions about women's relations to the problem of male power, to skepticism about religion, and it throws new light on how Dostoevsky can be read in the future."
1,Playing Beatie Bow - A review,"well, i had to read this book for english and i didnt really enjoy it. It dragged on a bit and it was really boring. Sorry if im offending anyone who liked this book but this is what i think. My teachers always tell me to give a reason so i will. i think the main reason i didnt enjoy this book was because it was a bit old. It was published in 1980, so thats probobly why. I wasn't even born then. Anyway, the book is about this girl called Abigail who ends up travelling back in time by accident, and the family she stays with thinks she's the gift or something. Im not going to say what happens in the end, not because that would spoil it but because i didnt read the end - it was too boring. (please note, this is not meant to offend anyone or anything. This is the review i submitted to my teacher.) Thankyou, Written By ME (no names for saftey purposes)"
3,A Good Book,Playing Beatie Bow was an interesting book because of the extensive historical content and because it told the story of a young girl growing up. I enjoyed reading in the Victorian dialect and seeing the cultural differences between modern times and Victorian times. I especially liked seeing everything from Abby's point of view because she is a girl my age who has some of the same feelings I do. It was a good book and I enjoyed reading it.
5,Another Ruth Park Success,"Playing Beatie Bow is a book which recognises the inherent childish qualities of 14 year olds, and how time and experiences can turn teenage girls into wonderful adults. It looks at life through many eyes, and at the changes which society has made - both for better and for worse - in the past 150 years. Reading this book has been an annual event for me for 14 years, and I am only 25. I can thoroughly recommend a book which will have you smelling and hearing ""The Rocks"" in Sydney well before the Harbour Bridge and the Opera House were even physically possible!"
3,What I thought of Playing Beatie Bow,"We had to study Playing Beatie Bow in class for English. It was an OK book, but I would have enjoyed it more if we got to read it of our own free will. However, after I read it, I found myself wanting to read it again. It WAS actually quite enjoyable, and the movie was good too."
4,A Good Book For a Teenage Girl,"I found this book very interesting, not just because of its facinating historical content, but because it was the story of a young girl growing up. I loved deciphering the Victorian dialect of the eighteen hundreds and looking at the many culture changes."
3,Australian SF Reader,"A girl from the current time, as far as the book is concerned, finds an artifact, presumably supernatural, and ends up transported back in time to the later 19th century.She has to adjust to this life, and the family she ends up living with, and the book follows her rapid maturity and relationships."
3,it's an interesting book. i need a biography of ruth park.,"it's an okay book, but its a bit historic 4 me. I need a review, and a biography of Ruth Park. If anybody could help me, please contact me at tiff_ani@hotmail.comthanks a lot"
3,An average book,This book was all right it had a good storyline but it didn't really axplain the dramatic bits like when the shop was on fire. This sort of book would be good for 13 to 15 year olds.I think i would recommend it to other people who like books.
4,A good book,At first I thought that the book would not be very good because all my friendshave read the book and told me they dreaded reading it. At first I dreaded reading it but when I read it I found it was very interesting. Overall I throughly enjoyed the book.
4,A very imaginative book,We thought Playing Beatie Bow was a really great book. It was compulsory for us to study it this year. Our English class listened to the story on tape and then watched the video. We think Ruth Park has really done well and the descriptive words are really great as well. It is almost like she lived the story herself.
5,Yard Machines 410,Just bought my 6 hp Yard Machine tiller at Wal-Mart for $578 without tax. Added oil and gas and it started on the second pull. I have run it for about an hour and it works great. It requires some pretty good effort to roll it when it is in neutral but otherwise no complaints.
3,Easy to understand,"This book has not been revised for 9years, but still the basic principles hasn't changed. It's written in a simple sentences which made this book easy to read and understand even for foreigners like I am."
4,Thin hair? KMS Add Volume Blow Dry Lotion helps,I struggle with thin hair and KMS Add Volume Blow Dry Lotion helps give my hair more body and texture. A little goes a long way to adding some heft to hair. My hair stylist recommended it and I've been using it ever since.
1,"Beware of ""Bad Book""",If this book was software it wouldn't even be Alpha. Mispellings galore... Examples without explainations... You name it... It is done poorly.. The first book I purchased without doing my homework and boy did I pay for it... Do yourself a favor review before you buy...
1,Quite a disappointment,I am not sure who would find this book useful... the explanations are very thin in most places and often it just has lists of types or attributes etc. with little or no explanation. The examples are few and far between (and poor). On each occasion I went to look up answers to questions re: HTML or JavaScript I ended up having to resort to other materials. The explanations and answers were not to be found here.
1,Bad Disc!,"I was looking forward to rewatching the tribute, as I saw it back in 2001 when it was first aired. However, the DVD stopped midway through the playing of it. I contacted the seller immediately & because they had no more of this DVD, I was refunded my money. Even though I would have preferred to have the DVD, I was satisfied with the transaction, because I was refunded my money very quickly."
1,WARNING: Awful Audio Sinc!,"On my copy of the DVD, the audio is way, way out of sinc with the visual image on more than half the segments. I can't appreciate the power of what the musicians are singing or what the actors are saying when so many of them look like poorly dubbed characters in a Japanese Godzilla movie. Yes, it's truly that bad!I don't know anyone else who owns this, so I suppose it's possible that only my DVD was deffective. I have to believe that if the previous reviewers had the same DVD as mine they would have mentioned this problem. (...)"
3,good only as an intro,"This is good as an intro book. For expert users, check out the Emacs LISP reference and tutorial avail on GNU site. Too much words for an intro book though... new users can quickly get lost in the sea of terms. The glossary is not nearly as complete."
4,"great, quiet bike","This Marcy bike is great. No missing pieces (perhaps the co. has improved on this since earlier reviews) and fairly easy to assemble, even alone. It's stable, super quiet and compact. I'm only 5 feet tall so finding a reasonably priced bike that adjusts sufficiently was quite difficult and this fits just fine. Although the seat is comfortable it does have some wobbling, but since the bike itself feels so stable this isn't really an issue. And perhaps the nuts can be tightened further with an extra set of hands. The resistance on my bike goes from easy at #1 to quite tough on #3 but I did adjust the lines a little when assembling. A good buy for the home - certainly beats going out in the cold to the gym!"
4,All in All worth the money,"It was suprisingly easy for me to put together considering I'm a 110lb girl. It only took about 3 hours but i did have trouble getting all the screws to get into their proper holes. It is slightly rickitty however I can go as fast as i want to and it won't brake or anything. It really is nice to be able to lose 200 calories while you watch your favorite T.V. shows. Also, I am very tall and I had plenty of space, and it's nice to have the handle bars in the front and on either side.If you are looking for a reasonably priced bike that won't brake on you, Marcy is a good choice."
2,Worked well until the pedal mechanism wore out,"I bought this back in 2008, but the pedal mechanism wasn't designed well (or I had a defective one). Within a year of casual use, the right pedal would fall off. After falling off, I would put the pedal back on, only to have it fall off again. After having not used this bike much for the last couple of years, I finally studied the pedal in detail. The threaded hole in the pedal was completely striped, so I have junked my unit and plan to buy a different product. Other than the pedal issue, I was happy with the product because this bike did its job, especially for the price."
2,You get what you pay for!,"I didn't want to invest a lot of money in an exercise bike as I plan to use it while recovering from surgery. This one seemed to be pretty well rated and the price was very reasonable. It does the job, but only just. I've had it for about 2 months and the monitoring device has stopped working reliably. Sometimes it tracks speed/distance/calories/time and sometimes it just won't come on. At first it worked great. Also, the seat is not very stable and is a bit wobbly. Not in danger of falling off or anything, but just not a secure connection to the base. Overall, the bike works about as well as you would expect one for this price to work, but I did hope for better quality."
1,Mainframe of bike was bent - too thick to bend back to shape to fit the screw in.,"We were so excited to get this bike, after purchasing it here on amazon.com. The box it came in was completely banged up and some of the parts were sticking out. We were concerned, but thought we'd check out the situation. We opened up the box and made sure we had all the parts; they were all there. So we go to start putting it together, and then we see that the mainframe is bent along the bottom. It's bent so far back that we can't put the first screw in. It's a thick frame, and we can't just bend it back to shape (at least without using a hefty mallet). We're so disappointed... we wanted to use the bike but it's not even possible to get past the first step, because of how much it was bent. It was either packed damaged, or damaged by the shipping company. Either way, whoever did it, I hope to get this replaced otherwise we're expecting our money back, obviously."
3,Great Bike for price,"I purchased this bike a few months ago and it's great. It was easy to put together. I would recommend this bike to anyone that is trying to exercise at home. I can watch TV and burn some calories at the same time. Con: the seat isn't that great, so I bought a cushion for it."
3,Disappointed,"I suppose you get what you pay for. It's pretty easy to put together, I did it by myself, only having trouble with the resistance cable. The tools that are supposed to be included were not. I read in another review and can confirm that no matter what bolts you tighten or how much you tighten the seat down when you really start pedaling hard the seat shakes and makes noise. The calorie display is way off (which isn't really a big deal to me.) I bought this so I could alternate my running (I run everyday) but I find myself still running the majority of the time. My 12 year old son really likes it though."
4,Well worth the money,"Bought this bike. Very pleased with it. It is ultra quiet. Can watch tv while exercising. Easy to put together. Not hugh, so it will fit in a small area without dominating the area, and it looks great also."
3,You really need two people to put this together,"I am still trying to put this bike together, seems to need some man power and some extra tools other than what is in the box. It has taken me two days so far, but I am giving it my best shot."
4,A good product for a good price,"I really like this bike. I like that it shows me how fast I'm going, calories spent, distance, and time. It runs smoothly and makes very little noise. It was sort of easy to put together. The only thing I don't like about the Marcy is that the backrest jiggles, and I can't seem to tighten it up, but that could be my fault. That jiggling doesn't affect the bike's performance at all. It showed up at my door almost instantly! I am a Prime member so I get orders within 2 days, but this recumbent bike was here in 1 and 1/2 days."
3,Just an okay piece of exercise equipment,"Bike had to be put together...instructions were pretty simple. Seat is still wobbly no matter how much its tightened down. Display easy to read. Seat is not very comfortable, after 15 minutes or so it feels like my butt is asleep. I purchased this bike after doing some online research. I should have gone to the store and tested some bikes also. This would have made a difference!!!"
5,kitchenaid gourmet cookware,"Love the cookware. Service was fast Price of cookware was very reasonableI wanted cookware that was easy to clean, not easy to have food burn, and wouldbe solid in construction. The Cookware was very detailed so you did know whatyou was getting. My new stove loves them."
4,Great Quality,"These are great pans. To test it out I cooked an egg in the 8"" skillet with no oil or butter and it was completely non stick. Wiped the pan of a few crumbs when I was done. Giving it 4 stars because I received the 5Qt saute pan bent (like the box was dropped) so bad that the lid wouldn't fit. Good thing these pans are aluminum, which is a heck of a lot more pliable than steel. Got it back straight with a plastic mallet and some well placed hits. :)"
4,awesome,"Really easy to clean, nothing sticks to the bottom of the pans not even the rice dishes i made which was surprising."
4,Good Price,"I am a pot-a-holic. I love pots. I love to cook. I really like these pots. They are easy to clean. The only thing is I wish they were a little heavier. But for the price they are well worth it. I make sure to use coated spoons or spatula's to keep them from scratching. I would definetly recommend these pots, you really won't be disappointed."
4,Classy pot rack for a reasonable price,"We have an ""upscale"" home but, like many people, have become extremely cost conscious. We had been wanting a pot rack for our kitchen. The pot racks in a kitchen store in the Medford area were in the $400 - $500 range and out of our current desired price range. The on-line store from which we got the pot rack from Amazon looked good, but, of course, pictures can be deceiving. However, the pot rack we received looks and feels like a quality item and looks great in our kitchen. A friend of ours has a pot rack that looks very much the same--and she paid much more for it. We are very happy with this product."
1,NOT Dishwasher Safe,"You would think based on KitchenAid reputation and the cost of this set it would be hands down an excellent set for most any kitchen. Unfortunately, and not until you have read all the fine print, would you discover the set is NOT dishwasher safe and as such unacceptable to be returned after having made the assumption and had already ran them through a couple of cycles to learn they now cannot be returned. It is ashame to later learn that lesser known makers of a similar sets of cookware, costing half as much, IS dishwasher safe. Lessons learned for when the handles degrade and fall off this product that we thought was a premier set of cookware. Buyer Beware. Read very carefully. The devil is in the details."
1,Pricing is absurd,"I've watched the price of this item increase weekly. The price of the 10 piece set is $129.99, but, for the 12 piece set that includes only the chicken fryer and lid is $100+ more? How is that justifiable?!"
2,Wonderful Cookware!,"I have had the same cookware set for about 8 years and knew it was timefor a change and upgrade. I read reviews on this and made the decision.Well, it was one of the best I've made yet! The cookware is extremely well made, heavy, durable and a joy to cook with. It actually cooks faster than my last set because of the material. I am currently looking for extra pieces that are available. This is a wonderful set and I don't believe you will be disappointed."
5,KitchenAid Cookware,Children got this for my birthday and I love it. The food does not stick in the pots or pans. They heat evenly. I have used them everyday now for two weeks and am very satisfied with the performance this gift gives me. Everything that KitchenAid said about the cookware it true. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009U5N08/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
5,Wonderful!,I love this cookware! I've been using handmedowns all my life. I never knew how different it was to cook with really good cookware. You use much less oil or water and get fantastic results!
5,Great Cookware,"I bought this set a couple months ago and have used several pans numerous times. They heat up so quickly and food gets cooked fast. I haven't had to use oil to cook as the non-stick really is great on these. They are very lightweight, which made me nervous, but they turned out to be great. I'm very happy with my investment in these."
5,LOVE THEM,This cookware is the best! You can cook healty becasue you don't need to use any oils. When you are done cooking all you have to do is wipe it clean. Will buy again for myself and as gifts!
5,Best purchase of the year!!!,Absolutely love this set. Cleans so well. I researched cookware sets for a month and this was the best buy. Don't miss out
5,"Good Quality, low price","I am very happy with this cookset. It is strong and sturdy, and the non-stick is better than anything I've ever cooked on before. They are easy to cook with, and easy to clean up. Also, the set comes with only useful peices, so you don't get the sense that you are paying for something you won't use, and you don't have to spend more money to buy extra peices the set does not include. I don't see any difference between this set, and my friend's more expensive set."
4,"Great cookware, especially for the price!","I am pleased with the quality of these pots and pans. They are a good weight, nice finish, and well-balanced. The large fry pan is particularly handy. My only reservation is that the shape of the lids makes it tough to store--the handles are tall, and when you invert the lid so the handle is inside the pan, the lid slips around too loosely to allow steady stacking of another pan on top. Still, I recommend these as a good value for the average cook/kitchen."
5,Essentials Indeed,"The KitchenAid Gourmet Essentials 12-Piece set is perfect for my family. I needed a new cookware set and in these hard times decided to look for something we could utilize that was priced right. Amazon and KitchenAid made it possible. My teens and I absolutely love the set! I did tell them when they leave the nest, they cannot take it with them. They weren't too happy about that."
1,Will not buy from warehouse again.,"I was a little hesitant to buy from the warehouse, but after reading the description for an excellent/like new condition referring to a dented box, I decided to buy these pans after all. I was very excited to be getting such a great deal. However, when they arrived, one of the lids was smashed into a million pieces, and the pans appeared used, having food splashed over the inside of the pans. Next time I will go with my instincts and will not buy from the warehouse again. Returning these pans was easy, although an inconvenience."
1,Two years of careful use and they are now junk,"I have had these since May of 2007. We never use metal utensils, no dishwasher, etc. The pans are now all sticking. They worked good for about a year and a half but are now going into the trash because everything sticks even with lots of hot oil! There is a 'lifetime guarantee"" but from what I was able to gather that is only good for the first year. That makes sense because that is how long they will probably last. This seemed to be a good set as long as you don't mind buying them every other year."
2,Hasn't held up well...,"I purchased this set at a department store almost 2 years ago, and have not been impressed with its durability. The nonstick coating on the larger frying pan has peeled off in the middle, and I'm afraid to use that piece, for fear that the nonstick material will come off into my food. The large skillet became warped very quickly, so it no longer sits flat on my glass-top stove, and it's almost impossible to heat food evenly. And the ""rivets"" that hold the handles onto the pots/pans are exposed on the inside of each piece, and are a pain to clean. I bought this set to replace an even cheaper t-fal set, but I think I'm going to have to invest in some quality cookware, rather than waste money on more cheaply-made sets like this. (Note: I'm not much of a cook. These don't get heavy use, but still haven't held up.)"
3,ok pots,The pots and pans were better than what we formerly had. The brand was well known and lived up to it's reputation. They were better than expected.
5,Awesome Pots,These pots are great! Food falls out of the nonstick like it was never in there. Cooks evenly and doesnt even burn. I love them and would definitely recommend these.
2,handles too heavy for small pots,"The pans, being non stick work very well. Clean up is a breeze and heat is distributed very evenly. However, I find that the handles of the smaller pots are way too heavy for the pots and it does have a tendency to tilt over while on top of the stove. It was unfortunate that because of this, I had quite an accident wherein the small pot tilted and the contents, which was hot oil, spilled on my hand. I got a pretty bad burn and since then stopped using the small pot to avoid such an accident. So be very careful of just buy the bigger pots and not the set."
4,Cook Ware,"I like the cook ware pretty well, except that the coating needs a soft scrubber & utensils to use to clean & cook. It can tolerate lots of use though."
2,First and Last,"Heat distribution on this product is non existent. How a cook can burn a meal on a low setting is beyond my thinking. When I bought this item I thought the problem might be the inconsistancy of the electric range. The apartment complex saw that I had an old range and replaced it. Since food still burns I believe it is the product, not the range that is the problem. It is interesting that the T-Fal set I had used on the same range didn't burn food like this set does. As soon as I have a few bucks Kitchen Aid is gone in favor of T-Fal."
5,Great set for a great price!,"I replaced some old nonstick pans that I've had for years with this kitchenaid set. What a great set, I really like this cookware.Kitchenaid Gourmet Essentials Hard Anodized 12 Piece Cookware SetThey are heavy duty & easy to clean, food comes right off. I shopped around before deciding which brand to get and these were the best value for the money. Thank you to those who wrote in your reviews about not using the porcelain pans on a ceramic top stove. I had no idea and almost purchased those pans."
1,a waste of money effort and time,"I had been wanting to buy stick free cookware for years. I read all the reviews for this Kitchen Aid product and thought I was home free. The first time I cooked in a small pot it warped. ""OK!"" I said, ""Maybe I put it in the sink with cool water, OK, I made the mistake."" Today I see that the PAINT is peeling off the inside of each pan where the handles are joined to the inside of the pan. I HAVE BEEN EATING THE PAINT. DIGUSTING. I have owned these for a few months. I am throwing them in the garbage so as not poison anyone else. Back to stainless steel and ironware. Do no waste your money!"
1,Held up well but poor customer service from Kitchenaid,"These pots and pans have been great but about 2 weeks after we got them, one of the glass lids spontaneously exploded out of the blue. We were in another room watching TV and heard what was almost as loud as a gunshot...in fact, I grabbed my gun to investigate. Kitchenaid said this can happen if the rivets were over-tightened and they'd send us a replacement as soon as they were back in stock, which was supposed to be about a month. 6 weeks later we called again to check and they told us they still didn't have any. 2 months later we got the same story. 2 months after that, same story. We gave up trying...luckily it was for the pot we use a lid for the least (the giant boiling pot). Great pots and pans, Kitchenaid just has crappy customer service."
5,Two thumbs up!,"The KitchenAid Gourmet Essentals Hard Anodized Nonstick is a great set!I ordered this set approximately two years ago. I cook on a regular basis, and the set still looks and performs like it's brand new.I've lived in two places with this set and have used these pots and pans on both an electric and a gas stove.The handles remain cool even when cooking at a very high heat and the lids remain tight at all times.I've been impressed enough with the set that I bought a second as a wedding gift for some close friends.They've had nothing but good good things to say about it as well."
5,Best ever for price,These pots and pans are of the highest quality and are well worth the price. KitchenAid has been and always will be setting the standard for everyone else to compete with. If you show the proper care for these you should get years of quality use from them.
2,A few years old and a bit dated,"This camera was impressive when I bought it years ago. Now, however, technology has advanced. You can buy a snap and shoot digital camera with a better flash and better speed now."
2,Avoid this Mint if you have a weak stomach,"Udall is a very good writer, but that doesn't guarantee a good novel. Treading in the footsteps of Charles Dickens seems to have compelled him to raise the level of brutality in the orphange to a dismaying level. Perhaps some ambitious writers feel that if their work isn't outraging some middle-class sensibilities, it isn't great literature. If you think works of art made from meat are cutting-edge stuff, this might be for you. The rest of us would be better off re-reading Oliver Twist."
1,Don't waste your valuable time,"I found this novel to be dark and depressing, not humorous at all. It dwells on the pain of being a child of an alcoholic, an orphan, and one who is picked on by bullies. If your reading time is limited, I suggest you use it on another book which is more uplifting."
4,Good Summer Read,"This is a good, sweet summer read. It struck me as being somewhat in the ""White Oleander"" vein: what else could go wrong in one person's life? The middle is a bit drawn out, but for me, the ending was lovely and sweet and made suffering through some of the middle well worth it. Edgar Mint is a marvellous character and by the end I just wanted to give him a big hug. I look forward to reading more works by this author as this book hints at greater things to come."
5,The 21st century Charles Dickens of Arizona,"I cannot add much to others numerous comments except to personally observe:1. This for me was the best book of fiction I had read in many years due to its unique story and writing style2. The way the whole story is conveyed and unfolds through all its twists and unforeseen events as seen and told by the young Edgar Mint of the title is not an easy task for an adult writer but is done brilliantly and convincingly3. The whole cast of memorable characters whether good or bad in their motives reminds me it seems so much of what might have been if Charles Dickens had been reborn and been relocated to current ArizonaA great talent which has been reconfirmed with his second great novel ""The lonely polygamist""."
4,the miracle life of edgar mint.,"The miracle life of Edgar Mint is about a boy named Edgar.As a young child Edgar grew up on a indian reservation with his mother, grandmother and other locals.At the age of seven Edgar had a freak accident when he put his head under a mail truck tire and was run over. Edgar was put in the hospital and was considerd a goner but with the help of one good doctor he survived and was called a miracle. Edgar stayed in the hospital for many years and made many friends and his best friends name was Art.when the doctors thought Edgar didnt need to stay their any more they put him in a boys school. Edgar had trouble fitting in and was always getting picked on by other boys at the school.I thought that the book was a great idea and a very funny and thrilling book with many twists an turns. It was the best book I ever read and Iam sure it will stay that way.I encourage you to read this book.."
4,perfect shape and fun book,Book came in plenty of time; It arrived in excellent shape and I was able to purchase it at a great price.
5,Edgar Mint,One of the best books I have ever read...and I am an avid reader. I strongly recommend this book!
2,Didn't finish it.,I started it but quit when I found something better to read. I'll donate this book as I have no interest to pick it up again.
4,Excellent read~!,"Excellent character development, and a good story make this novel a worthy read. This book is as good or even better than A Prayer for Owen Meany"" in my opinion."
5,Edgar Mint,"This book was awesome! Print was a bit small but overall a great purchase! Funny and entertaining! All I could keep saying was ""poor Edgar"". Will definetly put on my bookshelf sorry folks no resell here!"
4,A Tragic Comedy,"I cringe when I laugh at the tragic. But it's only fiction, right? This a great read about a remarkable boy in a series of tragic, and sometimes brutal, circumstances. Wonderful development of all the side characters. Recommended."
5,I'll never drive a postal truck again,"If you love this book, you may also like ""Tourture the Artist"" and ""A Short History of Tractors in Ukranian."" All three have a relatable form of dark humor, excellent reads."
4,Enjoyable 1st novel,For some strange reason this novel reminded me of 'A Confederacy of Dunces.' The two books couldn't be more different but they both have engaging narrators. Edgar Mint is the half-breed Indian boy growing up in northeast Arizona making his way after a life changing accident. Writer Udall employs first and third person narrative in his first novel. It works quite well. He has written an enjoyable but poignant story of Edgar whose naivete and gentle spirit help him navigate the travails of being harassed and beaten at his Indian boarding school. Then adopted by Mormon parents (a new one) and then searches for the mailman who ran over his head. So good I'm waiting for Udall to write another one.
5,#2 National Book for 2001,"This book was rated as the #2 best fiction book of 2001 (#1 was The Corrections)by both Newsweek and Entertainment Weekly. For me, however, it was #1. It is by FAR the best book I have read all year--in several years, for that matter. I believe that I will enjoy re-reading this book in years to come--I already have many ""favorite"" excerpts. Udall is hilarious!"
4,"Makes ""White Oleander"" look like a happy childhood","First off, I defy anyone to read the first two sentences of this book and not be instantly sucked in to the next 400. Edgar Mint is a well-built, captivating and memorable novel. But I object to the descriptions of this work as humorous. The cruelty, the sadistic violence, that Edgar endures is not for the faint of heart or weak of stomach. So be warned: the brutality described in the book is graphic and disturbing. But the remarkable thing was, it didn't deter me from reading. The story is that good.For another treatment of boyhood and miracles I also suggest ""Peace Like a River"", the exceptionally beautifully written novel by Leif Enger."
4,"Touching, rewarding AND funny!","If there was ever a time to use the word ""tragicomedy,"" this is it! Udall has created a tragic character in Edgar Mint who, nevertheless, manages to make us laugh out loud. From his ""accident"" with the head-crushing mail truck, to his placement in an Indian reservation school where the children take every opportunity to beat him up, to his conversion to the Latter Day Saints, Edgar remains an affable and perplexing orphan in search of a family and a home. I look forward to more work by this young author."
2,The disappointing life of Edgar Mint,"I was drawn by the rave reviews, the comparisons to Dickens and ""One Flew Over the Cukoo's Nest"". What I was left with was a bad taste in my mouth. The story was dark, with humorous moments interjected...the style is confusing, jumping between first and third person narrative...the characters were more caricature than developed. After an early life of pain, loss and heartbreak, Edgar is rescued by an ill-timed meeting with a previously unknown character from his forgotten past. There is a movie deal for the book...I would suggest cartoon artist Jamie Hewlett."
2,a native american Owen Meany,"Let's see.A story about a boy from a dysfunctional family, who is somehow physically different than the rest of the kids; he is a great believer in God and has a very strong belief in his vocation and the reason for his being alive.Haven't we read this book? Yes! It's the Native American version of Owen Meany!! Very smoothly told, don't get me wrong. But, why settle for less than the original.If you've read John Irving's ""A prayer for Owen Meany"",you might want to give this book a miss.Mr. Udall can certainly tell a tale. Too bad, this one has already been told."
3,An entertaining romp ...,"Brady Udall writes flavorful characters and memorable moments, but what seems to fall short is his lack of control over the length of this novel. About seventy five pages too long, and a bit over descriptive at times, his writer's hand begins to show through. Nonetheless, if anything, the first section of the novel is a very well written romp, full of dry wit, sarcasm and incredulous moments. Read the first 75 pages, and you won't be able to stop, because you'll want to know what happens to Edgar, but after the entire novel, you'll realize that the miracle was in the beginning and not how it ends."
5,the adventures of robin hood series.,this was a very good series the dvds were of good quality. i would recommend this dvd to any customer. the service was very good and quick. i would use amazon all the time.
5,Good Series,I had to return an order from another company because two of the four orders were defective and one was no longer available. This complete 4 series set was fantastic.
4,GOO SERIES FOR THE 50'S,"RICHARD GREENE IS EXCELLENT AS ROBIN HOOD. ARCHI DUNCAN IS AN OKAY LITTLE JOHN. MOST OF THE SUPPORTING ACTORS SEEM TO PLAY MULTIPLE ROLE IN THE SERIES. I REALLY LIKE THE THEME SONG, IT HAS A GOOD TUNE WITH WORDS."
3,The Adventures of Robin Hood: The Complete Series,"This is a classic series for all ages. When I ran across this series I knew my husband would love every minute of it. I am extremely pleased with my purchase, and my wish for you is to get as much pleasure out of this wonderful series as I have picture (DVD) quality is generally a 3. However, a few of the earlier episodes show flecks, or poor contrast, or faint tints of green."
4,Riding through the glen,One of the best shows of the 50's is alive and well. No one has done Robin Hood any better than Richard Greene and none ever will.Some episodes have some sound problems but that's probably to be expected with such old footage. I am just glad to have this stunning series available.
4,Hail to the Chiefs Hailing Baseball,"For those who have wondered about the tradition of our nation's leader throwing out the first pitch of the season, here is your answer.Authors Mead and Dickson have compiled this entertaining look at how each president, beginning with one of the most UNathletic chief executives, William Howard Taft, has related to the national pastime. For example, while rough- and-ready Teddy Roosevelt was not much of a fan, Franklin Roosevelt was instrumental in keeping baseball going during the dark years of World War II.Dwight D. Eisenhower was a pretty fair ballhand, a minor leaguer who found greener pastures in military and political pursuits. And Richard Nixon was considered by some to be an astute student of the game.The President's Game is well-illustrated with seldom-seen photos and would be a welcome addition to both the baseball and the political science fan's libary."
2,Not a Guide To Tribbles,"If you like reminiscing about how great the tribble episodes are this may be for you. I was hoping for some made up anatomy, biology history stuff and this is none of that. Its really just quotes from the episodes and some unfinished jokes (no really!) And its only about 10 pages. Save your money and write your own book would be my suggestion."
3,"Does the job, but needs help!","I used this for my Supermicro X7DVL-3 Motherboard. It works just fine, but since it is a passive heat sink, make sure you have enough circulation from other source to help with the cooling. The heatsink did come with a thermal grease pad."
5,a must have flute cd,"this is a great flute cd. i enjoy the fact that the cd has many preformers rather than just one. Jean-Pierre Rampal, of course probably the most famouse flutist, and William Bennett, an amazing flutist who I was fortuante enough to hear in person, are both on this cd, as well as a few other great flutist. i especially enjoyed Siciliene, because i have never heard it played with flute and hard, and because i have played the piece myself.even if you haven't heard of some of these songs it is wonderful to listen to them. i recomend this cd for flutiests of all levels."
5,great flute hits,I love any flute music. This cd offers a great assortment of favorite songs. Flute music soothes the soul. I recommend it.
4,Enjoyed!,"Remembering big department stores as a kid, and watching enough TCM to empathize with Joan Crawford working girl types, this book gives great insight as to how the entire business was born. It discusses it with enough detail at times to be a little dull, but learning how class distinction, unions, gender, and income so changed the retail and social landscape of the early to mid 20th century was fascinating. I shall also state that Macy's is the evil empire every time I miss Jordan Marsh, Marshall Fields, Shillitos, and the many other regional department stores."
3,A mixed bag,"A happy medium? While still using synthesizers, Queen reverted back to their rocking ways on several tracks...providing a mixed bag.While John Deacon has his first big hit (with underlying gay themes) in ""I Want To Break Free"" other tracks fall limp (in both song and video) like ""It's A Hard Life"".This may have been the most message oriented album to date, dealing with various issues from nuclear war (""Hammer To Fall"") to hunger & poverty (""Is This The World We Created?"")""Radio Ga Ga"" may be a cringe inducing song title, it's meaning is clear, in these days of visuals, people lose track of what's actually being said.This album marked the first (and only) time Queen recorded in America.While in essence, a more ""Queen-like"" album, it still fails to sell in large quantities and marks the decline of Queen's popularity in America."
4,second tier queen,"hit or miss on this one. The hits are radio ga ga, it's a hard life, hammer to fall, and maybe I want to beak free. The misses are ""tear it up"" and ""man on the prowl"" not a bad Queen album, but they were capable of much more."
4,The Works works!,This id definitely worth time and money to get. It flows well and gives enough vintage Queen for everyone to love. The two remixes at the end are classic Queen as if in concert. Bravo!
5,Great example of 80's Queen!,"This album shows Queen retreating back into their rock roots after the experimental ""Hot Space,"" and it is a welcomed return. I find myself singing the silly line ""all we hear is radio ga-ga, radio goo-goo"" over and over again because it's so catchy. I also love the rocker ""Hammer to Fall,"" and the Queen-ish but still experimental sounds on ""Machines."" It really shows that Queen, while being a rock band, is not afraid to incorporate an 80's sound into their fold. I love it. Definitely worth buying."
5,MUST HAVE!,"For any Queen fan, one cannot move forward without The Works. For bands I truly cherish, having the CD is far and above the way to go."
5,one of the last great Queen albums,"And no, not every song is great. However, there are so many great tunes on here that it outweighs the filler significantly: Radio Gaga, I Want To Break Free, Tear It Up, Hammer To Fall, It's A Hard Life, Machines (Back To Humans) and my favorite Queen ballad, 'Is This The World We Created?' The filler, i'd say is... 'Man On The Prowl', an unimpressive rewrite of 'Crazy Little Thing Called Love' and Just Keep Passing The Open Windows. I rank this one a little bit above 1989's excellent The Miracle and significantly better than 'A Kind Of Magic' and 'Innuendo' (Those two albums weren't bad either. Just not better than The Works or The Miracle)"
3,"not bad, but feels somewhat contrived","I could be totally off-base here, but after Queen's disappointing Hot Space, I wouldn't be suprised to hear if outside influences (specifically the suit-wearing ones) made a ""suggestion"" or two concerning the direction of the band's follow-up album, The Works. There's alot of ""Queen-like"" songs (whatever that means) on here, but they feel too calculated & by-the-numbers IMO...derivative of themselves, if that makes sense.While it's better than Hot Space, you get the feeling that Queen ""settled"" with The Works instead of going with their gut. It's still a decent album, and the extra track ""I Go Crazy"" is their heaviest rocker since ""Sheer Heart Attack"" (live version) or ""Stone Cold Crazy""...almost worth the price of the album for that song alone."
3,Queen-Works,This album was ok. I knew a few of the songs already but as a big Queen fan I wanted to see what the rest was like. Freddy's voice is worth the price every time.
2,Coulda been a contender but...,"...it's all been done before. Merz's ""Fixer"" is just an awkward hybrid of James Bond and Vampire the Masquerade. Predictable plotline with a lot of one-dimentional characters and some campy silliness thrown in. A fluffy airplane read, but that's about it. If you're looking for serious vampire gumshoes, gangsters and secret agents, then I recommend Keeper of the King by P.N. Elrod and Nigel Bennet, The Vampire Files by P.N. Elrod or just go with the Anita Blake series."
5,A Great Homeschooling Resource!,"My nine-year-old son is a budding scientist, and he has little patience with the more language arts- based curricula ususally offered. Nebel's has provided an alternative that has made him a more eager student, and me a more relaxed and happy teacher!The book has a framework for all the basic subjects that should be covered in elementary school, along with suggested websites, over 200 experiments and many ideas for getting the points across. The first chapter, ""Teaching Strategies"", is very valuable.The book is non-sectarian, with no disrespect for religion or the lack thereof, so it can be used by anyone."
3,"Good, Not Great","Truthfully, I love the Wailing Souls. I don't know a reggae fan that doesn't. But I honestly disagree with the notion that this is their best material. It is certainly in the same category as their awesome roots vibes of the 70's, and far better than the synthesized music the band would later stray toward (ugh!), and both the sound quality and packaging are great (it comes with the entire dub album on one cd), but I definitely prefer ""Firehouse Rock"" and ""The Very Best of The Wailing Souls"". Certainly check those two albums out!"
1,A Grave Dissapointment,"After all the hype I expected this disc to be great. Boy was I wrong. I love the Wailing Souls but I cannot even listen to this. What were they thinking??? A truly poor and weird output from one of my favorite reggae harmony trios. The first track, ""Row Fisherman"", is such a bad version of a great song. Skip this and buy Firehouse Rock or Face the Devil. Even better try and find a copy of their first (and best) lp from 1974."
5,Powerful,"This album might not ""fit"" with the rest of the John Cale catalog, and it's certainly not for the faint of heart, but man oh man, this is some powerful rock and roll. Raw, unrestrained, emotionally riveting songs. Not anything close to a ""greatest hits"" live approach, instead Cale heads into unknown territory, but he does it very succesfully. His version of the old Rufus Thomas song ""Walkin' the Dog"" is almost unrecognizable. And then he really shifts gears by having a young woman in his band sing a a stunningly beautiful track called ""Only Time will Tell."" One of those ""takes your breath away"" moments. The bonus tracks here (that weren't on the original vinyl album) are quite good too, making this a MUST purchase."
5,Extra tracks make this great CD,"The extra tracks - from the EP ""Animal Justice"" make this a must buy for Cale fans.""Hedda Gabbler"" is particularly good and ""Rosegarden Funeral of Sores""[covered later by Bauhaus] is not far behind.The live tracks capture a good performance from Cale with the band in good form."
4,the wonderful wizard of oz,"after a twister in kansas dorothy and toto are now in the land of oz, they want to go back to kansas as they are missing aunt em and uncle henry.the munchkins and the good witch of the north tell dorothy to go and ask THE WIZARD OF OZ for help he lives at the other end of the yellow brick road.al;ong the way dorothy meets lots of new friends like the scarecrow,the tinman and the lion who also need help from the wizard so they all come along with dorothy and toto.will dorothy and toto get back to kansas or will the WICKED WITCH OF THE WEST get them.find out in this magical video."
3,:0),Its was ok a bit longggggggggg but a ok read for me. 512 pages are a bit much. I really like that they were dreaming about each other though.
1,Very slow paced and hard to trudge through...,"This book was the only book I ever read by this author, so I have nothing to compare it to, but it's horrid. the author isn't consistant in her writing and the story line is so boring. The heroine Alexandria gets kidnapped from her French foreign escort in the desert by a band of nomands, coming to find out the prince who kidnaps her she knew as a child. But the story just drags and doesn't keep intrest where it should. It had potential but didn't use it. The villians weren't convincing to me. I just didn't believe in the end that she loved him at all, and he her. All in all I wouldn't recommend this book,unless you're very bored, lol. But can I make a suggestion if you're wanting to read something exciting and touching? Try Virginia Henley's Falcon and the Flower, or Raven and the Rose. Or something similar to this book I would suggest Johanna Lindsey's Captive Bride, which has similar story line, but much more exciting and interesting...=)"
1,JUNK,A few months of very light use and this poorly made in China product is now ready to be added to the landfill. The shredding mechanism is made of plastic and thin metal blades that appear to have become misaligned and self destructed. My previous shredder was perchased for around $30 and lasted 5 + years. Profits over quality... Called Ativa. They will not stand behind their product.
3,Where has all the rock music gone?,"Maybe not surprisingly, this is a much weaker effort than the brilliant ""A Cheap and Evil Girl"". The problem is not so much the song-writing, which is still good, as the music, which is largely monotonous and culminates in an uninspired cover of ""Boys of Summer"". If you hope to find the likes of ""Smitten"", ""Faster, Faster"", or ""Guttermouth"" on this CD, you will be disappointed. Since we are in dire need of great female rock-musicians, but don't need another mediocre singer/songwriter, it remains to be seen whether BS can live up to the promise of her debut on her next few albums."
4,"ehh, wasn't bad.","Well, I had been looking forward to the cd's release since July and today (it being August 13th, the first day) I made sure I got it. I loved her first cd, that's why I couldn't wait to get her new one. I stopped at best buy and they didn't have it! I was like wow, but I ended up getting it at Wherehouse. Anyway.I listened to it once so far and it isn't half bad. I think the first album has a little more edge, but it's just a different sound. Perhaps I just haven't listened to it enough yet.All in all, it was okay... I just need to listen to it more."
3,good cd,"Fav songs on the album: Galaxy Song, Lazy Afternoon, Sunday School and Cigaretts, Boys of Summer, Everything Feels Wrong, Grim and Lily (definitly the best song on the album). Although Bree's first cd is good because all the songs are constructed well for radio airplay."
3,OK...not excellent,"Like many other reviewers, I love ""A Cheap and Evil Girl"" and was excited to get the new CD. It was a letdown. The whole album is rather generic and unmemorable. The best song, in my opinion, is ""Boys of Summer"" and it's a cover. Buy ""A Cheap and Evil Girl"" instead."
4,Great,"I just like very much this album ! Meaningful lyrics, charming and powerful music, great voice; this Bree Sharp's second album is great ! I like the first one and this one didn't disappoint me at all ! My faves are : Lazy Afternoon, Galaxy Song, Sunday School and Cigarettes and Everything feels wrong.Just go listen to it !"
1,Too General and Extremely Topical,"This book reminds me of many magazine covers: it promises a lot more information than it delivers. There is very little of any specific help here. Worse, it sounds like it is written by someone who has no real idea what it is like to live with debilitating chronic pain. Run 5K??!! How about, I can't walk around the block? There is no help offered for people with pain that is more than moderate in nature. Topics that should receive some real attention are skimmed over in a matter of a couple of pages or even a few paragraphs. I had expected better from a Mayo Clinic publication."
1,Never got it,"I never did receive this book. I emailed the seller at least three times to no avail. What now, as the charges have gone through!?"
5,Take me back to the sound of Philly,"This album takes me back to the days of my youth and listening to my dad's records. Now that I am older I can truly appreciate the genius of the ensemble know as MFSB. Most know of MFSB's work through their `Sound of Philadelphia' disco orchestrations (The theme music for Soul Train is an example). The Best of MFSB definitely delivers that sound. If you want to feel like you are stuck right in the middle of a movie set from the 70s, this is the album for you. However, this band goes far beyond the lush strings and horns of the disco theme. Tracks like `Something for Nothing' and `Poinciana' stretch the limits of the 70s dance sound."
2,Pina Colada Cocktail Sugar Drink Rimmer,"This was pretty good but wished it was not blue, it is kind of weird since my pina coladas are creamy colored or if strawberry coladas, they are pinkish with red strawberry garnish or yellow pineapple with umbrellas that match the drinks and garnishes but BLUE??? rimmer didn't make much sense. Might go back to others I have tried that went with drink and drink decors!"
5,Make yours the BEST Lemon Drop martinis they ever tasted,"What a classy and tasty addition to an ice cold Lemon Drop martini. Make YOUR cocktail party a little classier than most and one your friends will remember. A little goes a long way. Wet the rim of the glass with a lemon wedge and then roll the outside lip of the glass in this sugar, fill glass with your ice cold concoction and it is magic!"
1,Very depressed after reading,A friend recommended this book. I read only three fourths of this book until I stopped. I did not find it helpful but very depressing. I do not recommend this book. I do recommend the other book this author has written called Destined For the Throne. I certainly would not recommend this book who is not a follower of Christ or does not read the bible. I don't disagree with the scripture the author used but I do disagree with his interrpatation of the scripture. I am tossing this book in the trash.
4,Great translation!,Its often really hard to get the meaning of words just right when taking them from another language. This was a great job.
1,Bought this for a Class. Hated it,"I bought this book for a Philosophy-ish course I took while in college. I hated reading every page of it. Although the writer has some interesting ideas to present, his dense language alone made it particularly difficult to get through even a few sentences without asking yourself ""What the heck is he trying to say?""If you're interested in pompous, complex, theoretical ramblings, then you'd love this book. Otherwise, stay clear."
1,I beg to differ with you all - this is a very sad book.,"My daughter received this book for her seventh birthday today and as her father I was very excited to read it at bedtime. As I read it aloud, and we moved through the phases of a lifetime, I realized that the book was headed towards old age and...death. By the end, my daughter was crying and very upset. She does not upset easily, and we read hundreds of books a year, and this is the first time this has happened. I do not believe this book is appropriate for 4 - 8 year-olds, and I urge you to read it completely before sharing it with your child."
3,Okay,"heavy writing in pages that I am using for class. Was described as very good I would post it as acceptable or good not very good. However, the book did ship fast and was packaged nicely."
3,"Not what I wanted, Really","What I REALLY wanted was 101 Strings, arranged and conducted by Nelson Riddle: copyright 1984, Alshire International, Inc. with selections such as: Swingin' Stampede, Meandering, Latino Sentimental, Tina's Waltz, Freeway Fantasy, Costa Brava, Twilight On The Mall, Nelson's Blues, Retrospection....somehow I ended up w/this, which is OK, 101 Strings always is but probably because I'd just ""learned"" how to use a computer I thought I'd be receiving that which I REALLYREALLY wanted."
2,"I'm not the target audience for this book, but maybe you are","This book's target audience is stressed-out business people. So for them, I bet it is great. But right now I am a stay at home Mom, so coming up with a Mission Statement is not high on my priority list. But I really enjoyed the stories about Winston Churchill and Mother Theresa, so I gave the book one star per person. This book would be a great starting point to help you figure out what is most important to you if you haven't done anything like that before with your life. On a skiing scale, it would be for novices. I've been doing a lot of work on myself lately, so I'm an intermediate and I didn't get much out of it. One book that I did enjoy was Dr. Phil McGraw's Life Strategies. It's a quick read because he writes in terms everyone can understand, and it gave me a lot to think about."
5,"Very general, bud good","If you are searching for a set of rules to get your life on track this is a highly advisable read. He talks about the affects of roles, missions, and values on how we make decisions about who we are and identifying who we want to become. It is a very COMMEN sense book which does have a lot of what's already been said alot of other times, but is still well worth reading."
4,the improvised version,"The ideas in this new book no longer amaze me. Why? Because I have practised thus integrated them into my life and be 'one' with most of them. I am a better person now - and thank you to Hyrum Smith for his former book. That book really revolutionizes the way I look at things that matter most to me and at the same time ignore if the things that bug me are out of control.Every idea goes through a refinement process. I thus see this new book as a better version of the first; along with some new ideas that sure will change my perception about life again. Human being needs to be constantly reminded. With this new version, I can look at the same idea from a different angle.I do not have any complaints about this new book. After all, Hyrum did change my life and save myself from getting an ulcer. Thank you Hyrum!"
1,Nothing new here,"There are a few reasons why I will not buy this book:1. It is merely Hyrum's old thoughts recycled. It contains material mostly from the second half of his time management book.2. I already have Stephen Covey's 7 Habits book. What is Franklin Covey trying to sell here? They seem to be selling two separate philosophies: Covey's 7 Habits approach and Hyrum's Discover/Plan/Act approach. Cognitive dissonance anyone?The subject matter of this book is best covered in Covey's 7 habits book. While I criticize Covey for milking the 7 Habits paradigm for all its worth with mediocre follow on books after his first magnum opus, atleast he has a lot of material in that book.What I would have loved to see from Hyrum Smith is his original book reworked for the Palm world. Unfortunately that is not to be."
4,New Rockabilly,This is a really good album. Paul Roman's voice and guitar playing has gotten better over the years. It would be good if they got back to there psychobilly roots but this album is stil worth buying if you can get your hands on it.
3,Not bad not sensational,"At times I get reminded of the clash, The Rockats, and at times I get reminded of Mike Ness' solo stuff, but I can't shake the feel of the 80's all around. They really tried some different stuff on this one, but much of the changes sound the same. The vocals get better as the album progresses, but the first few songs actually annoy me. I'm hard music critic though."
5,quakes are good,"if you like psychobilly, this is for you, it has an older sound and feel to it with kind of a sense of a little swing. i enjoyed it very much"
4,New Generation all over again...,"I keep buying every Quakes record that comes out, but I still like the early stuff the best. This is more like the big Sony release ""New Generation"" to me. It in no way shape or form is a bad record, but it just seems to be the same thing again. I think the same thing happened to the Stray Cats and I guess once you find your sound it sticks with you. This has the Quakes sound, but it is the later Quakes that has that Adam Ant thing going on. I love the rockabilly treatment Echo and the Bunnymen get on this CD, and the deep bonus cut is an instrumental that would give a lot of the more traditional bands a good run. If you are a Quakes fan like me you must buy this, but I still have a love for the crazy raw anger of the first and second records. Those were way more psycho, and the Quakes were the only true Euro style psycho band from the states back then."
2,Not much to this.,"Keep your money in your pocket - it was mildly entertaining - therefore two stars. But in hindsight, if you don't already own it - don't buy."
4,To The Beat Of The Song,"With the success of Dance Dance Revolution sweeping the arcades, many people have the definite need to shake their grooves off to those delightful dance games right in the comforts of their own living room. That has definitely been truee to the bones with this beat pad which is highly suggested for both PS2 and Xbox owners, not as much for Nintendo Gamecube owners though. This is easy to use and essential for each step if you've played DDR at home. Gamecube owners however might want to consider going for another dance pad, like the Beat Pad Mad Catz designed especially for MC Groovz Dance Craze, or DDR Mario Mix which just recently hit the store shelves all over again, after a near seven month absence. Step lively, step.Price: B+Control: BCompatability: BOverall: B 1/2+"
5,this is the best way to get all their 70's stuff,"This box really rocks just like aerosmith does. And you get all those early cd's here and the live ones and a bonus disc. This is a great package and other reviewers give you the full details on what's in this box. I was glad to get this box with it's remastered editions of classic cds like 'get your wings' , 'aerosmith"" , 'live bootleg' 'draw the line' and not so great 'night in the ruts' is in here but it's an ok cd but the rest of the package is first class. Making this the aerosmith package to grab for this era of songs."
3,The Miracle isn't really a true miracle,This left me luke warm on my frst listening and hasn't warmed up since then. It seems this is classic for the lost period of Queen when they hadn't figured out where they wanted to venture next. Thank God they found their way out of medicroce (sp?) and gave us great albums after it
2,Queen - The Miracle (Review),"This is a really poor album. Innuendo is a better choice if you want to hear Queen in decline. While the musicianship and production are competent, the songs are just not what you expect from these four men. I Want it All could pass for a real Queen song if you mixed it in with some other tracks, but that's about all you'll like on Miracle. Skip this one unless you've already heard everything else the band ever did. Note- if you're new to Queen's later sound, try Hotspace."
3,A mediocre late '80s offering,"Many who heard the power chords and anthematic chorus of ""I Want It All"" were lead to believe that Queen had returned to their rock roots, discarding the heavy synths that had marred albums like ""A Kind of Magic."" Unfortunately, those same tendencies run through this 1989 release. There are some great songs here, including the already mentioned ""I Want It All,"" the breezy title track, and the scathing ""Scandal."" But there are just as many throwaways, including Roger Taylor's ""The Invisible Man,"" ""My Baby Does Me"" and the downright embarrassing ""Party."" The album closer, ""Was It All Worth It,"" may be the strongest of the lot, with Freddie Mercury looking back on a life of rock and roll excess and pronouncing ""Yes, it was a worthwhile experience."" A very uneven release, but worth it if you're a Queen fan."
2,One word: Bland,"Queen return to the U.S. charts with this album though, as a whole, stands as a weak effort.Of course, you can always count on a few tracks to make buying it worthwhile.The band look back and question themselves with the rock anthem ""Was It All Worth It"" to which they answer ""It was a worthwhile experience!""""I Want It All"" stands out as the best of the lot with it's heavy metal leanings and cries for equality (at least, that's what I got out of it.)Then it's ""Breakthru"" which has a quality that I've always enjoyed in songs, it makes you happy. When Freddie sings ""If I could only reach you, if I could make you smile..."" it has a profound effect on me.Unfortunately there's the watered down disco-like ""The Invisible Man"" and the pseudo R & B track ""My Baby Does Me""....ick.With it's Euro-centric sound, I was surprised to see the album break the top 30 here (this was after all, the hair metal 80's) but charting is charting. Save this one for the last batch of Queen albums you buy."
2,If you 're new to Queen - avoid this album.,"I'm a fan of Queen and they'e one of my favorite bands even after twenty plus years but this album is definitely the worst Queen album. Even Hot Space was better overall. For my money there are two good songs on this album, (Kashoggis Ship and I Want It All), and one great track (Was It All Worth It). The rest ranges from ""alright"" to downright embarssing. And Freddie Mercury's voice by this time had declined quite markedly.He also makes the mistake of tending to shout too much.Things would get better with the next album Innuendo but The Miracle is clearly Queen in transition and somewhat surprisingly losing their way."
4,Fun album,"This album is fun to listen to. You won't much of the brilliance of their early work, but it's still a very good album. My favorites are the miracle (great video), and the hit I want it all. The album is a mixture of lite pop to rock. good pop include the solid breakthru and rain must fall, and the hard rock includes the second track and was it all worth it. The only song i'm not crazy about is the first track party, it seems a bit weak for an opener. All in all a good album from Queen"
4,I want it all!,"This was actually the first Queen-album I bought. After this I followed the moto of the track ""I Want It all"". So know five years later I have it all. All the Queen-albums, I mean. Now, this is not my favorite album. But still I enjoy listening to it. Nice lyrics, especially on ""The Miracle"", ""I Want It All"", and the funny ""Rain Must Fall"". Once again Queen made an album with great diversity in songs, just compare with other artists and you will see what I mean. This album is not perfect, but it is good. ""I can see it in your stars, you're life is so exciting, acting so bizarre, you're world look so inviting"" Excerpt from Rain Must Fall. The guitar-playing on ""Was it all worth it"" is awsome, and the drumming, the bass, and off corse, Freddie."
5,Queen was still great in the 80's,"1989 -nineteen eighty-nine was a great year with regards to Queen. This is a true work of art- every song is golden. The music lives up to the title. And, Pebozo questions my authority - ha! Go ahead and listen to your lackluster Paul Rodgers and Queen CD. I'll stick with a classic."
5,hi,"I'm not really doing this so that I can review anything I just wanted something that I wrote on the web. I mean, I could review it--I've heard most of the tracks but I choose only to say that I really enjoyed the songs ""The Miracle"" and ""I Want It All.""p.s. If you could just say that this was a helpful review I would greatly appreciate it.p.p.s. My name isn't even Kevin"
4,Brian May gets to play again,"For a band that long prided itself on 'no synthesizers', it was sometimes painful to hear their work on albums such as The Works and A Kind of Magic. The electronic gadgetry is still here, but so is a return to highlighting the great work of guitarist Brian May on tracks such as I Want it All and Party. Invisible Man is a neat mix of the old and new Queen sound. For me, this is the band's best album of the 1980s. They'd truly return to impressive form with Innuendo in 1991."
4,gets better with age...,"Queen diehards aren't gonna forget about the band's output from the 70's after hearing The Miracle, but time has treated this album quite well IMO. And in hindsight, the lyrical content of a few songs seem as if Freddie was dropping hints of things yet to come (particularily ""Was It All Worth It""...it took on a new meaning after Freddie passed away IMO). The album has an overall pop flavor, but all the trademark Queen elements are intact. There's a few straightforward rockers such as ""I Want It All"", the aforementioned ""Was It All Worth It"", and ""Khashoggi's Ship"" to pacify hardliners, but one can't help but get hooked on the infectious pop grooves of ""Breakthru"", the title track, and ""The Invisible Man"" (featuring a ripping solo from Brian). A definite step up from their prior album A Kind Of Magic (which didn't do much for me...sorry), The Miracle is worth checking out if you have eclectic pop taste..."
3,Disappointing Queen album,"I've been a member of the Queen fan club twice so you could say that I am a big fan of Queen. However I have to be honest and say that this album was a disappointment.After the excellent ""A Kind Of Magic"" album, which contains some of the most emotional music Queen ever did,most of this album sounds fairly uninspired and even bland. ""Was It All Worth It "" is a blazing rocker with one of the best riffs of all time, ""I Want It All"" is a fairly good anthem, and ""The Miracle "" is a fairly good ballad. The rest of the album however is fairly forgettable. If any readers are using these reviews to decide which album to buy from Queen, I strongly recommend that you do NOT buy this ,or ""Hot Space""as your first Queen album,as it may give you a false impression of Queens music and the power it can sometimes convey."
4,Good but too much marxism,This is an older account of how San Domingo became Haiti and the rode to freedom from slavery. Be warned it carries a Marxist slant throughout the whole book but once you ignore that then the story is very compelling. It is one of the best accounts of what happened on San Domingo and you get a sense for how the French Revolution influenced what was happening the Caribbean. If you are just starting out on Caribbean history this is the perfect book to start with. It shows how the cultural identity began to take shape and what happened to the French Caribbean possessions.
5,A must read,The Black Jacobins is an ecellent book. I highly recommend it to everyone especially to Haitians to supplement their knowledge of Haitian history. The book is well documented and provides an inside view of what really went on during the war of independence.
1,interesting but,"Hated this book, it was like pulling teeth. Style was choppy at best and author often jumped from one conclusion to the next."
3,"good price, but not as strong as the ones from hardware store","I bought these to use for consigning toys and to wrap the price tag around stuff, but the tab that locks down the zip tie is so flimsy that it gets loose easily and then it just doesn't work. So it's an ok product, but not the best."
3,smaller than you think,width wise these are a little smaller than i expected. They are what they say they are not much to see here.
2,A diatribe,"Rather too soon after taking up this book, I have put it down. Mr. Fleming's combative, aggressive tone, his History Channel style, the irritating absence of a separate bibliography and the errors of fact have all contributed to that. I intend to give the book away."
3,lopsided illusion,"This is a work of impressive scholarship, with some interesting and important new information (at least to modern readers). However, in my view, it is marred by the negative tone througout what I read of it (I confess I didn't finish the book). It seems to me that rather than presenting a truly neutral position on the U.S. entry into the war, he goes too far the other way, and ends up as an apologist for the Germans, who were by no means innocents needing to be defended. If you are going to read one book on the First World War, this is not it."
1,Revisionist Pap,"Fleming has produced another piece of revisionist garbage. Though he is generally correct on the facts in this book his personal animosity shows through so plainly that it detracts from the flow of events. I am not concerned with what the author thinks. I would have much preferred a book that lays out the facts and timeline with minimal commentary. Fleming has confused editorializing with interpretation. He provides no opportunity for the reader to form their own opinion because he is so busy forcing his own down the reader's throat. In short, I wish I could have the hours I spent wasting my time reading this book back."
1,Expensive urine,"Like most Muscletech non-protein supplements, this product is meant to catch the eye of young, uniformed bodybuilding novices. They are the contempory version of the buff muscle beach guy not getting sand in his face ad. I am old enough to remember seeing that ad in comic books. If you are in it for the placebo effect, than this is your company."
1,Absolutely pathetic and ridiculous,"When I hear new singles that are considered ""music"" on the radio, I wonder what is happening to our taste in anything that is relevant or contributes to our culture and society. This steaming, pile of dog #*$# is one of the most ridiculous songs I've heard lately. Why can't rap or hip-hop music have interesting lyrics and say something? It hasn't always been like this! Rap/hip-hop can be great music generes but with crap like this popping up on the airwaves and people lapping it up like a thirsty cat, we'll never see music improve or become what it should be---enjoyable, fun and WORTH listening to.The chorus to the song basically says:I'm hot, cuz I'm flyyou ain't, cuz you not.Yeah, he's a regular Shakespeare, this one. Do yourself and the rest of us a favor, bypass this shameful excuse for a song and find something better to listen to. If I could give ZERO stars I would....actually, if I could give a negative number I would. AVOID AT ALL COST!"
3,Not as good as I thought.,"I heard this song at a strip club and the stripper was going off while they played it. I kinda was dancing to the song, too. So I decided to get it once i got home. Well, its nothing that special. The lyrics are meh and the beat is ok. Not as good as when there's a naked girl shaking her big booty to it. I learned my lesson, dont buy songs you here at a strip club."
3,This Is Why I Rock...Kinda!,I heard this in a commercial years ago and was hoping it would be released and finally gave up until I happen to come across it on Amazon and said FINALLY. I like it for what it is but it seems like this is an edited version without a explicit counterpart but it is no less entertaining. This was possibly crafted mainly to gain crossover appeal and was never meant to be an official release but just for radio promotion of the album. Still all in all I think it strikes a fair balance between it's rock and rap elements without going to far in either direction. - Grade: C+.
2,"Catchy, But Lacks Substance (Rating: 5 Out of 10- -2.5 stars)","The song is okay to me. I don't want to judge by this song alone, but it looks like Mims' rhymes are somewhat limited, and lack substance. But it's very catchy, as he says ""This Is Why I'm Hot"" in his hook. Also when I hear it at clubs and at house parties, people start dancing, so it's a good dance song. If you listen to the radio a lot, you probably already heard this song, and probably like it."
1,Waste of time,"The author's goal is to make Colson look as good as possible. He's a Colson cheerleader, not an objective historian. If you're looking for a critical and insightful look at Colson and his role in the Nixon Administration don't wasteyour time on this title."
5,A Riveting Read!,"Williams knows how to spin a good tale and she does so in A Conspiracy to Ponder. When Joe Clark's brother was shot to death, it altered Joe's life. Now, six years later, as a police detective, he is investigating the disappearances of thirteen women in the Chicago area.The larger plot involves an international donor operation, and the abducted women are being held in an abandoned hospital, where doctors perform illegal surgical procedures. Joe is aided in his search for the culprits by Wu Chong, a reporter from China, with an agenda of his own.When Joe stumbles on to the bloody trail of a sinister man known as the Colonel, the plot begins to thicken. There are so many exciting facets to this suspense...an absolute must read!"
3,Its about damn time!,"This band has all the elements needed to sit back and insult the boring while lashing out at the musically fickle minded psycho. Not since Zappa's early days have I heard something new and insulting! It was like channel surfing into an unknown realm of music while taking a sound test in a vacuum. An audio orchestration of dimensional perversions and much needed truth in music today. Reagan's Polyp shows the world real artistry into sound while most of the world, like our brains, limits itself to a dull and cowardice existence of greed by both bending down and kneeling over! This release is worth both kneeling down and bending over for!"
2,Not the quality I remember,"I purchased this brand of tubing six years ago from a hardware store. It was flexible, easy to work with and provided me with many years of service. The tubing that arrived a few days ago is so stiff and inflexible that it is very difficult to work with and you have to heat the connections to get a seal on junctions and emitters. Unfortunately it doesn't always seal completely.It just feels like cheap plastic compared to the old stuff."
2,"Plastic, not rubber","The tubing is plastic, not rubber, so it is stiff and less flexible then the other tubing I have used. It gets the job done, but not as easy to place where you want it."
3,Synthesizers? The beginning of the end,"THE GAME introduced synthesizers to Queen albums, much to the dismay of many fans, and while there are a number of good songs; the shift away from what made Queen successful (Rock with a pronounced flair for the dramatic) to what today sounds very dated. The chief offender in this is ""Another One Bites The Dust"" with its attempt to unite noir lyrics with a bass heavy dance beat. The song was a huge hit for Queen, but it still seems like pandering to what was popular at the time, going against the basic concept of the band. That's not to say there aren't standouts here like the rockabilly of ""Crazy Little Thing Called Love"" or the sweetly haunting ""Sail Away Sweet Sister,"" but there are more forgettable songs here than on any Queen's prior recordings and on the whole THE GAME is strangely unsatisfying. It is a portent of things to come."
4,The Last Great Queen Album,"This is a great album. Two of their biggest hits, ""Another One Bites The Dust,"" and ""Crazy Little Thing Called Love,"" are here. My favorites are ""Need Your Loving Tonight, "" and ""Prime Jive."" Most of the other songs are top notch, too. None of the later Queen albums matched this one. Definitely in the class of Night At The Opera, Day At The Races and News Of The World."
5,underated,"This is a great album, it's a mixture of pop and rock. The first side is flawless, but side two let's us down a bit. Actually 'coming soon' is the only song I don't like on this album. The game is queens first and probably best 80's album."
5,a brilliant game,the game is one of best albums from queen after live at the bowl and i highly recommend this brilliant album.five stars.
2,If it was not for Dragon ATtack ...,".. I would rate it more kindly. But the aforementioned song is one of the greates pieces of junk Queen or any other band ever wrote. The rest is medium, almost below average for Queen's standards...!!"
1,Musta been soundalikes cause this was not Queen music.,"This is such a poofy album I dont know where to start. Crazy Little Thing Called Love sounds like it was recorded in a bomb shelter somewhere with such a hollow sound souless tune I thought me speakers were out of synch. Another One Bites The Dust, yea me when I heard this for the first time. Yea its got a cool bass opening but so do many songs,My Sharona comes to mind. Disco was supposed to be dead or dying and they came out with this snorrer.This whole album sounds like a bunch of throwaways they had laying around and put together just to fulfill contractual obligations.They didnt sound hungry anymore and each subsequent album after this were basically just the swan songs of a once bold and uncompromising group of talent."
2,the end,"Some high points, some low points, but overall pointed the clear path towards Queens demise as an artistic force. Embracing pop. And what's more, the shameless and uninspired way in which the talentless bassist, Deacon, blatantly ripped off Chic, for that baseline from Good Times, undescores the limitations of this album. It's one thing to borrow a theme, elaborate on a theme, but what Deacon did was dishonest. This kind of dishonesty is a symptom of his musical incompetence really, since he didn't know better.At the time, when the album came out, it was a bit of a shock to the kids of that era, since Queen was turning its back on its inventiveness. They had embraced the pop single as their only format. After this it would be Flash Gordon and David Bowie, in other words: nadir.It wouldn't be until Queen's final album that they would again take up the mantle of artists. In the meantime, they were following the trend of euro synth pop."
5,Greatest Queen Album Ever!,"Queen is my all time favorite band and the way the album brings out the best of Queen is amazing, in my opion this is the best Queen record ever."
3,Another typically bold but watered down Queen release,"3 1/2There is always something for everyone on most popular Queen albums. Unfortunately, wonderfully competent they may be in the art of pop songwriting, the band succumbs too often to their keen, even innovative (the beginning of the 2nd verse of Another One Bites the Dust is transcendent) take on the genre instead of concentrating on their more fluid, tender, and most importantly, well written and played ballads (always fronted by the brilliant antics of guitarist Brian May coupled with Mercury's vocal mastery) as shown with a few of the album's closing songs, not to mention the great intro song. In between however, lies some of their more predictable and formulaic material (when they still released important albums)"
5,A very heartfelt collection of songs,I truly enjoy listening to this CD. I find it very calming. The music is tender as well as fun and light hearted. Louis' love for his music and the things and the people he writes about come shining through.
5,Beautiful music that is beautifully played,"I have listened to all the music that Louis has written and played that is available to the public. I have always been an avid piano fan, but his music surpasses most of those that used to be my favorite artists. I am looking forward to hearing more from this very talented musician."
5,"Furtwangler provides a new perspective on ""The Federalist Papers""","If you think ""The Federalist Papers"" are the end all and be all of Constitutional thought you will be re-educated by the studious Furtwangler. Furtwangler dispels all myths of ""The Federalist"" in this easy to read book. If you want to learn, read the sound work of Albert Furtwangler."
4,good but too many covers,"I purchased this CD on just his reputation and only hearing his duet with Leann Rimes. This is a respectable CD. The orginal songs are awesome, especially the stuff he has done with Gregg Alexander. I am somewhat disappointed with all of the covers that he has done. Some are good but most I just couldn't grab. Best cover is ""We've Got Tonight"" with LuLu. I give the orginals 5 star and the covers 3 stars."
3,"Ordinary Voice, But Good Song Selections","I chose to buy this CD because I like the song, I Hope You Dance, and this album included said song as well as other good songs. However, I found the singer's voice ordinary. I would not recommend the CD to anyone."
4,Good covers of several songs,"I bought this album for Ronan Keating's covers of ""Words"" and ""We've Got Tonight,"" and they don't disappoint. The other songs are OK, too. Glad to have discovered this singer."
5,Olive Leaf- know your source,"Olive Leaf Extract was originally developed and marketed by East Park Research in Nevada, which I understand holds a processing patent. This useful book uses much material from East Park's research. Olive Leaf represents a vital, natural substitute for some of the more toxic drugs for chronic infections. Dr. Walker has provided a concise and excellent overview for both the patient and the practitioner. Well worth looking into."
2,Review of Olive Leaf Extract,coud not find enough scientific data to corraborate findings in this book. Much of material I found was hearsay. However there was enough info to question the use of pharmecuetical drugs in compariso to natural products.
5,Never fails!,I hope they reprint this book. My copy is getting old from being used so much! I have tried almost every recipe from this book--always wonderful. The results are always perfect. I can't think of another book I own with such a great success rate.
4,Old favorites,"While this older edition of the Greyston Bakery Cookbook doesn't have the beautiful photos of the enw one, it has recipes of old favorites such as the Pecan Tart. As you cannot order the Pecan Tart from the bakery retail anymore, this is the next best thing."
5,Quaint!,"I would fully recommend this quaint (and free) book from Amazon. Although most of the characters are female, it is a delightful book for men also. I was drawn into the characters and their female world. The characters are rich and interesting and the reader is left feeling they are already familiar neighbors and friends. Their struggles are universal and their foibles are common to us all. This makes it easy and entertaining. Although I read it several times, my most enjoyment was in reading it out loud to someone else."
2,Not so good,"Works as a basic meter, but it has no auto shut off, as I am used to with all other meters. Consequently, the battery is always dead when I want to use it. Spend a few more $$ and get one with auto shut off..."
4,A new perspective on writing research,"Because so many people in this field are not trained in statistics and are uncomfortable with numbers, there is relatively little quantitative research going on. I don't advocate for a totally quantitative approach by any means, but, as the author suggests, a mix of qualitative and quantitative data give the richest picture. She has tried hard to make this book user-friendly for us non-math types, and my eyes only occasionally glazed over.Good book."
3,"TIGI Catwalk Curl Collection Curlesque Hydrating Conditioner, 8.45 oz","While this conditioner is a nice, thick product and made it easy to comb through hair, it is VERY perfume-y, and I found it somewhat difficult to rinse out."
3,Oddly compelling,"Unfolding with a little of the feel of a gothic romance, this book makes for an interesting read. It is informative, too, on subjects from English history to project management, with some particular insights into the artistic development of the English gardening tradition. It is not tightly written enough to be a gripping narrative; it is not well organized enough to be an invaluable reference; it is not uninhibited enough to be a fascinating diary. However, by combining elements of all three approaches, it scrambles its way into being a worthwhile investment for anyone interested in the subject matter."
4,Things to do when the world ends,"This is a fine exploration of the various ways the world could end. I disagree with the other reviewer here for the stories are about people coping with disaster, trying to find ways to salvage something out of the wreckage. The stories are divided into two categories. The first stories in the book are about how man brings disaster on himself (nuclear war, overpopulation, etc.) The last half is of disaster coming upon the earth (asteroid strikes etc). What makes the stories enjoyable is that they are about survivors, not victims. In fact, one story details a desperate plan to avert the threat of overpopulation -- at a terrible cost. Most of the stories really fall into the action/adventure category with the stakes being extremely high."
2,Malfeasance of Text,"Dr. Lande has poorly researched the aspects of Civil War, preferring instead to demur to general logistics, rather than in-depth perusal of legitimate history. His writing resembles that of a high school report, with poorly constructed sentences, run-on phrases, choppy verbosity and a verbal cadence that approaches boredom. The true battlefield in the book is the one between the author and his lack of writing expertise. Read it with a grain of salt, and spare your wits for much better treatises on Civil War history."
1,disappointed,"I ordered 2 finger tip towels and one hand towel as a gift. the small finger tip towels were nice.They had embroider flowers and butterflies, they looked like the picture. they also had a Lenox tag on the underside.This hand towel looks so cheap!It is very plain and looks like something I could have bought for a dollar at a thrift store. It does not have a Lenox tag, no embroider,and it does't look like the picture. This towel is a big disappointment."
5,Lenox Waste Basket,"Love this waste basket! Beautiful design and much nicer than plastic. I also ordered the shower curtain, soap dish and dispenser. I love this design!"
2,Breaks to easy,"I don't know what exactly these pieces are made of, but it broke with a slight bump. I mean it was not dropped! I'm very disappointed in what ever it was constructed with. This is why the low rating!"
3,Needs uplifting,"Good premise, but the funny moments are few and far between, and the overall atmosphere is slightly depressing."
1,Don't waste your time,"I confess - I couldn't finish watching the pilot episode of this series - it was just too silly.Thomas Jane is a better actor than it would seem if you'd only seen him in this episode. Perhaps the series improves at some later point, but I just couldn't justify wasting the time to watch long enough to find out."
3,not what I expected,"The show is not what I expected and is actually funnier than I thought although it took almost the whole first season to develop the whole premise and i found myself getting a little impatient with the show, but well written, some good lines and I'll definitely get the second season...."
5,I wish I could buy it.....,I was only able to rent this on video on demand. i wish I could buy it so I could watch the nudity all the time whenever I want.
4,HUNG Review,This DVD set is great. The show is relatable and very entertaining. A great way to pass time when traveling or on a lazy day at home.
2,good premise but not hung on show,"mans point of view.......was looking for a new show to watch. i really like breaking bad, game of thrones. someone at work mentioned 'hung' I never even heard of it so I checked it out. im three episodes in but I find it kinda bland. great premise but needs more californication / weeds mixed into it or something. The main character Ray Drecker is too 80's and out of touch, needs a make over. Maybe that happens later on but I dont think I'll make it that far in."
5,More than just a pretty face,This series offers more than just a gimmick. It deals with a man's mid-life crisis and how he uses his attributes to his and other's advantage in handling a variety of situations.
2,No Californication,"I love Californication and thought this series would be fun, too. But, I was dissapointed. The characters were just annoying and underdeveloped. I watched about 4 episodes and just couldn't get into it. Moves too slow. And really not worth the price by episode that amazon charges."
5,Reggae Dancehall,"The full name is Johncrow by the Fireside - Reggae Dancehall, Shocking Vibes productions. Tracks include:1. Johncrow - by Tenorsaw / PYCERAL2. Mister Press Button - by Beenie Man3. I Can't Live - Twiggy4. Change Yu Plan - Fluffy D5. Hay Yah Hay Yah - Buccaneer6. Never Keeping Secrets - W Wonder / Spragga Benz7. Body Good - Merciless8. Big & Tall - Judas9. Hot & Spicy - Tonto Metro10. Body Guard - General Degree11. Enamel - Frisco Kid12. Can Do Without - Twiggy, General Degree13. All the Man - Tonya Stephenson14. Check Ya'Self - Galaxy15. Showdown - Terry Ganzie"
5,Better than almost anything,"This has been one of my top 10 favorite albums since the first time I heard it in the 1970s. Freddie Mercury was one of the most talented musicians I've ever heard, and also one of the most tormented. I miss you, Freddie! Paul Rodgers is talented for sure, but he's not a substitute."
4,Great Album,"This album is one of Queen's very best. Seven Seas of Rhye, Ogre Battle and Nevermore really shine.But there are a few drawbacks. Loser in the End is the only Queen song that I can call bad. The drums are OK but the song overall isn't that good. The opening 'procession' is not exceptional.If you're just browsing and not familiar with Queen get 'a night at the opera' or 'the miracle' before going to this."
3,Queen's progressive concept album,"There are many Queen fans who absolutely worship this album. While I certainly agree that it has many fine moments, the ""progressive"" conceptual ideas of the album kind of box them in. The trademark layered production is certainly here, but the album lacks the incredible variety of styles that would turn up on ""Sheer Heart Attack"" and ""A Night at the Opera."" The album opens with a brief instrumental, then heads into the folk-rock singalong of ""Father to Son."" Split pretty evenly between Brian May and Freddie Mercury-penned songs (with Roger Taylor adding one), I'd have to say Mercury definitely has the stronger batch here, especially with the classic ""Seven Seas of Rye"" and the brief but effective tearjerker ""Nevermore."" Many of these songs are fantastical in nature, so if you're into dueling queens, fairies, and ogres, you may love this album a bit more than I do. Still, it's a fairly strong album, and definitely ahead of its time production-wise."
5,Very Good Sophomore Effort! Great Extra Tracks!,"After a very promising debut album, this follow up shows a more polished effort but still with Brian May's influence clearly at the fore both stylistically as well as songwriting-wise. The band's first hit, a more complete version of ""Seven Seas of Rhye"" that was also on the first album shows us the quirky side of Queen with the very quaint ending of the song.The disc has been remastered quite well and so the sound quality is very good. In addition, the cd cover unfolds to show all the lyrics and looks very cool. What made me give this disc 5 stars though was the bonus track, the remixed version of ""Seven Seas of Rhye"" which is truly brilliant!"
3,A sonic treat,"Queen's big splash came with this sonic achievement which produced their first ever top ten hit ""Seven Seas of Rhye"".Harmonies finally gelled with this piece and there has yet to be an album whose lyrics were nothing but sheer poetry.It starts off regal enough with the instrumental ""Procession"" in which Brian shows off (for the first time) his symphonic-like guitar playing.The most overtly Led Zeppelin inspired album in their catalog, virtually every song deals with a mythical theme (""Ogre Battle"") or painting fantastical imagery from songs inspired by centuries old artwork (""The Fairy Fellers Masterstroke"".)The album's cover (seen above) is now considered a classic.This is ""art rock"" at it's best."
3,"Oh man, THIS is gonna make me unpopular","While this album is consistently considered one of Queen's best, I personally don't enjoy much of it -- just my opinion folks, different strokes for different folks. I really enjoy ""Ogre Battle"", ""The Fairy-Feller's Master Stroke"" and ""Nevermore"", and a couple of the other tracks, but this one isn't one of my favorites. My apologies to all of my fellow Queen fans that love this album -- sorry. :( To each his/her own."
4,Much Better Remaster II,"I was a bit rushed on the first album review because I was at work, still here but a bit more time, anyway, like the first album it has remastered much better then the original release on CD & the last remasters released. A lot of the muggy sound on this as well as the first one is less noticeable. If your a solid Queen fan then you love this remaster over the original. My favorite track is White Queen (As It Began)but whatever your favorite is it sounds much better then the last released version of the album. By all means, buy it!Stop by my site sometime and say ""Hi"" @ Judemac Forever""."
3,Why Did I Ever Get Rid Of This On Vinyl???,"Queen II was released before they were very popular in the U.S. Again, this is one of those albums that I bought when it first came out. I still like some of the songs today...Especially, Father To Son. The tracks are varied and not overdone like they were on some of their later works. It was when they became commercial that I dumped this album. But, still I ask why did I ever get rid of this on vinyl??? Queen II still sounds pretty good to me today...considering all of the so-called classic rock or soon to be classic rock that is out there."
3,Dispatch delay,"Haven't received it yet. After this order i had to cancel some others because the delay was for months, just for Queen albums. Very disappointing."
4,Good value/great treat,"I purchased a case of 12 for $24.99 (not including s/h) and it was well worth it. Very good bone, with marrow and jerky still left on. My dogs were able to chip and even crack the bone, so you will still need to supervise with this treat. Perfect for large/giant breeds!"
3,It was ok.,I guess i could not get into the story. I thought from the reviews it would have been better...but it wasn't.
4,Good Medieval Romance,"The Moon Lord is a good medieval romance with Knights and Lords. It's a little cookie cutter medieval romance but if you're new to the genre, you'll like it."
5,Invaluable,"I used this book for intro psych in first year, in classes for second year and still find it a valuable resource in third year.It is a fantastic book!"
3,Maybe it's just me,"But I expected more of a resolution -- either someone ends up in prison or a psychiatric hospital. My feeling throughout the book was that Moravia took the role of interviewer -- but in a psychoanalytic setting. Such was not the case ultimately, but I imagined Desideria on the couch as ""Dr. Freud"" asked questions, encouraging Desideria to reveal everything. The story moves rather slowly, impelled by sex, Marxist revolution, and a nihilistic Voice in Desideria's head.The murderous Red Brigades era in Italy must have been on Alberto Moravia's mind.In retrospect, it does resolve, just not how I expected."
2,"5 stars for Melba, 0 for production","The production of this CD is, simply put, a shame. First of all, some of the tracks end abruptly in the middle of applause or even while Melba's still singing, no fading out, but just stopping (imagine!). Secondly, there is no booklet, no liner and production notes; you can call it a really cheap thing. It wouldn't be that horrible if the songs were to look over, but on the contrary: Ms. Moore sounds great, with an absolute mastery of the material and more warmth and flexibility in her voice than in some of her other records. Plus passion and listenable joy of singing. I deeply appreciate the artistry of Melba Moore, but am almost disgusted what the music industry does to her - with every of her later records, but especially with this one. Again: it's a shame!"
1,Only FOR DIE hard Fans,UGGG!Only the most DIE hard Melba moore fan could enjoy this cd. I am surprised they released to be honest......
5,Minor Mishaps - Jens Christersen,"Excellent movie, fantastic actors describing everyday life with intelligent sense of humor and tenderly describing human mistakes and misunderstandings. It's like very little happening but suspecting something terrible is going to happen, and finally the authors seems to trust mankind, something quite exceptional by the way in the XXI century. Actors have the ability of describing life as it is, and apparently life is good."
5,Lovable Clifford!,"In this Clifford book, Clifford is left behind when Emily Elizabeth and her family go on vacation (too far for Clifford to walk). While my toddler would love any Clifford book right now, this is one of his favorites since it has a bus on the cover, and bears and a semi-truck inside. Plus, we both love the ending!"
5,Great reading for my son,"My 6 year old son is a big fan of Clifford and reading. We got several of the books, and he really looks forward to using these for practice."
4,Clifford Takes a trip,My 2.5 year old really likes the Clifford books. The reading and stories are simple and easy to understand.
2,Not appropriate for these parts,"We're big Clifford fans in my household (as evidenced by other highly positive book reviews! really!). I had high hopes for this classic Clifford from 1966, but we should have skipped this book. The reality is that I have to teach my 4 and 6 year old boys how to react if they encounter a bear (or mountain lion), which is a real probability even in residential areas around here. Picking up and hugging bear cubs has a good chance of leading to your demise. Yes, Clifford saves Emily's day (and life), but it's just inconvenient to have to remind my boys that this is just a pretend story and don't count on Clifford. Time to move on to a Clifford book we can simply enjoy without the safety reminder from Dad."
3,hopeful,this book is hopeful because of the fact that he wanted to make sure everything was alright and so he traveled just to do so and they all thanked him in the end of his journey because he saved his owner.
4,It's a nice slip.,"It's a fine slip, nice quality. I was hoping it would have been a little more generous in the cut but it's nicely made."
1,Not what I had hoped for,"i was hoping to get some complete stories, however this book just contains excerpts, which means i wont even bother reading it. The book seller was great, though. no complaints there!"
1,very misleading,"This is not unrated, it is rated R. The box says unrated, but the DVD says R. It does not contain the music videos you would expect, it is rather dull interviews with hookers and video footage of a party which is highly edited and is best viewed in fast motion (or you will fall asleep). This is a totally disappointing. Musically, it does not contain quality sound, nor are there any significant music addtions that you have not heard before."
2,"Let the buyer beware, cos this ain't all that","This DVD is neither one thing nor the other: it's got too much softcore T & A to be a rap video and too much rap to be an adult video. For that reason, it will satisfy the expectations of neither audience. We see a lot of Snoop partying with his homies and we get several interviews with the strippers and would-be porn starlets who shake their thang for the camera throughout but that's about it, really. No really cool rap videos for those who want rap but at the same time no real action for those who want adult enta'tainment."
5,That real type Gangsta...!,"This movie is not for kids!Imagine you at a barbacue and you choppin it up, chillin with your home boys and some honeys(or the other way around). Then...Snoop walk through the door with a gang...Next the D.J you got put on some beats(some ole g'd up west cost...) Snoop and his peeps start freestylin, women start gettin loose(I mean ""LOOSE"").That's the vibe of this video....hollaCheck it out! It's worth the doe."
1,BEWARE IT IS SOFTCORE,OK i was jumping for joy when i thought i receive the movie that cheap. I viewed the xxx version this doesn't compare. Germany tv comerical are better than this. i watch 3 minutes of it and i found something more exciteing like pulling weed around the house. don't waste your money. Buy the real version i know you will like it
3,Good but this is not.....,This version is pretty good. But if you want to see it all get the xther version for adults.
4,Sonny Criss at His Brilliant Best,"The first four tracks feature Hubert Fol. They are fine, though unremarkable. The next four tracks feature the Michel De Villers Octet, with De Villers on baritone sax and Fol on tenor. Again, fine, though my life would not be diminished if I had not heard them. What follows, seven tracks of Sonny Criss, is sublime. Criss' potent mix of brilliant, blistering alto technique and deep, yearning blues sensibility was rarely heard to better effect. If you are a Criss fan, you DEFINITELY want this disc. If you aren't a Criss fan, then you haven't heard enough Criss. Treat yourself and pick this up.By the way, I'd rate the Criss tracks 5 stars in a heartbeat, but the other tracks just aren't that remarkable. As a compromise, 4 Stars."
2,Material not real worth it.,"Ive purchased multiple dvds from the international academy of middle eastern dance. IAMED. But this is not worth it. Its ok to know the mechanics of the moves and where they came from, but I dont really need to know to do a hip circle with my but, and my abs, and then this way and that. I was hoping for different hip movements and layers. Not worth the price. Show me how to do some sizzling hip already!"
3,"Cute watch - but band already broken, so not happy with quality","I love this watch, but a little after a month, the band is already broken, so that's disappointing. Now I have to see if I can return or have it repaired. Doesn't say much about it's quality."
2,Did not hold up as well as my previous Swatch watches,I have owned numerous Swatch watches over the years without problems. I was disappointed with this one. It stopped working suddenly (mechanism broke inside) and had to return it to be repaired. I returned it to the seller and it took a ridiculous amount of time to repair (over 8 weeks) and then the face plate was not put on correctly (the 3 was in the position where the 12 should have been) making it difficult to read the time. I should have returned it again but was reluctant to lose it again for another 8+ weeks. Now it's not keeping time correctly even though I've changed the battery. Guess I just got a dud this time...It will unfortunately make me think twice about purchasing another Swatch watch.
3,Looks great but......,"The watch looks great, I love the colours, the size, the design of the hands. It works fine and seems very water resistant. I have been wearing it constantly for five months, I have been swimming and the beach alot, I also wear it for a heated yoga class and when running, so it has been exposed to sweat, sea water, chlorine, sand and sunscreen. A clear plastic coating on the strap has started to peel off. The other thing is it has a loud tick. My husband insisted I buy a new watch as he cannot stand it!"
1,"watch arrived broken, i returned it and am still waiting for the refund. 'Nuf said. Not happy.","the title says it all...loved the watch in the picture, was disappointed but figured i would wait for the refund and then order a different one...but it has been a month now and the refund still has not come. Not a happy camper...guess i will stick to books."
3,"Cute, but started falling apart","I bought this watch 7 months ago, and I've worn it almost every day, including in bed, in the shower, in the sun, etc. The colors have stayed bright; the watch tells time perfectly well; and I've gotten a number of compliments on the cheerfulness of the design. However, a month or two ago, the clear plastic coating on the band started to bubble and peel up, exposing the stripey colored layer beneath, and it now looks pretty shoddy as a result, so the band hasn't stood up to 24/7 wear."
1,Piece of Crap!!!,"""I have given a 1 star for this item because there is nothing less than that. The item arrived in a broken case, full of scratches on the watch dial. Please don't buy from this seller. I'm going to return it !!!"""
3,Great... At First,"O.K., get this clear: this watch obviously does not last forever. The face scratches easily, and the colors do not match with everything! The watch is fun, though, and totally worth the price for a few compliments. Also, there is a plastic covering that encases the band. I've been wearing this swatch for 6 months and that has started to peel off. The numbers are large and easy to read, to I'd recommended it to someone young or with sight problems. Also, the watch is extremely waterproof! I never take it off, not even in the shower. I love this watch, but it's getting to be time to get a new one."
2,made in china - what do you expect,"Looks fine, easy to install, but it is defective and only turns one way. Itis used on a little used closet door so I did not bother to return it."
3,NOT BAD FOR A FIRST TRY,"Definitely not Harris' best...I had no empathy for any of the characters besides oddly, the antagonist. Looking forward to ""Red Dragon"" from the elusive Mr. Harris."
2,Black Sunday,"BDD audio has unearthed Hannibal's author Thomas Harris's archaic back listed novel, Black Sunday. This dated narrative of terrorists at the Superbowl is an insubstantial audio project at best. Veteran audio narrator Ron McLarty aims very hard to bring this audio to life. The abridgement of this text is the downfall of this audio book."
4,"An Oldie But Goodie, Definitely Worth A Read","If you've ever seen the movie Black Sunday, which itself was well done, then you owe it to yourself to read the book. Thomas Harris takes what has become the most anticipated day in all of sports and turns it into a platform for sheer terror.What is so scary about this book, as with so many plots involving terrorism, is that this could happen. Whether at Tulane Stadium (the setting for the Super Bowl in the book), at the Orange Bowl (the setting in the movie), or any other of America's crowded sports venues, all it would take is a well-placed bomb or something worse (?!) to turn carefree fun into chaotic frenzy.Black Sunday is a must for the bookshelf!"
2,Typical...,I loved reading all of Harris's other books so I decided to give this one a try. I did not like it this book at all. It read very much like a Tom Clancy novel and lacked the spark of all three of the Lector series books. It seemed too focused on the PLO but I suppose that the book was timely for when it was published in 1975.
4,Black Sunday,"This was a great novel. Thomas Harris keeps you intrigued, and gives great descriptions of both characters and events. The plot and Characters were well developed and very believable (now more that ever after the recent tragedies our nation has been faced with). The only problem I had with this book was his over attention to detail. At times, I thought, the information he gave was useless, and did no more than bore me. However, I can see how someone else may see the information as valid and fascinating. Overall, this was a well-written novel, and I would suggest it to anyone who enjoys fast paced novels full of suspense."
4,Politics & Sports & Murder,"From fiendish terrorism on our own turf to political insanity, you'll never look at another *blimp* the same way again! Great read & oh so dangerously possible!"
3,What did I miss?,"I've read all the review. I honestly don't see what was so good about the book. The summary made this one of the most highly anticipated reads for me ever. But the plot moved along slowly I thought. The conclusion was too fast. Sorry, I loved everything else he's done. I just couldn't like this one. The author is what saved this from a 2 star."
3,"Preety Good, but not that GOOD!","Perhaps I have just been spoiled by Thomas Harris' other books but 'Black Sunday' just doesn't manage to measuere up. I didn't feel anyhting for anythingof the characters and that was one of the biggest flaws of the book. Perhaps the plot is still enough to keep one interseted (even though the book was wrote for 1975) and I probably will not look at a blimp the same way again,but I just expected more from Thomas."
3,Not as good as I would have hoped for.,"This was my first Thomas Harris novel and I didn't think it was all that great. The story concept was original and the ending was suspenseful, however the story didn't develop smoothly and the characters were very dry. In that sense I mean you couldn't tell what their motivating feelings and thoughts were, they just carried through their actions robotically. If you were to compare this to ""Sum of All Fears"" by Tom Clancy (simply because they're both terrorism novels) you'd see what I mean. The characters there had motivation and you could understand where their actions were coming from, and consequently I think ""Sum"" is a much better novel. I'll probably read Harris' other stuff. I imagine ""Silence of the Lambs"" must be better than ""Black Sunday"" since the film was so good, plus the novel came out later in his career. As a final comment, I thought about giving this novel only two stars, but the originality of the plot took it up a notch."
3,Harris' intriquing but dense first novel...,"Upon my perusal of this book in my local library, I found a relic-like early hardcover edition embalzoned with the warning ""Don't begin this book unless you plan to finish it in one sitting.."". Hardly.Granted, many parts of this book are compelling, especially the front-row seat the reader gets to villian Micheal Lander's descent into madness (in my head I kept picturing De Niro--he'd have been perfect for the '77 film version), sort of a Harris trademark. Unfortunately, the narrative gets bogged down in the impressive but stulifying minutiae of the Arab terrorist plot, as well as the unappealing Isreali agent protagonist who unravels it.Regardless, its a first-rate thriller, but far removed from his later true page-turners."
3,Black Sunday,"The basic plot is fascinating. Can an ex-POW mastermine the total destruction of a stadium during the Super Bowl by using a bomb strapped to the bottom of a blimp? Harris tries to go into the psychological developments that would turn a person into a sucide bomber. This book was first published in 1975 but after the events of September 11, 2001, this book has new and eerie significance.Nonetheless, I can't give this book a 10 because the story quickly becomes mired in backstories and character developments only vaguely related to the central plot. I ended up resorting to skipping chapters that didn't directly deal with the main consipirators. If the story had been edited down by about a third, I would have rated it a 5."
3,"A bit old-fashioned, but I liked it","All the makings of a good book. If provides us with a splendid insight on how terrorist organisations work, and how an operation takes form. Almost like a top-secret briefing.All of a sudden 9/11 looks a good deal different..."
4,Good Analog Meter,"Sometimes it is best to have an analog meter where the fluctuation in voltage and current can be seen easier. This may help with locating an intermittent connection or marginal component problem. Therefore I prefer the use of an analog meter such as this one whenever possible. This meter has the mirrowed scale so that readings can be made more consistently and it does have a 10 ADC connection which is helpful for me. I don't like the fact that they don't want you to use the 10 ADC connection for very long. Also I don't like the ""Green"" battery checking sections ... I think they are worthless for anyone that knows how to use the meter on a normal DC voltage scale. But overall the meter is a good analog meter for the price and has performed well for me in general."
4,Great little analog meter.,Nice graduation on the scale and large enough to read. Case doesn't feel as solid as the old micronta ones though.
2,"Easy on the eyes, hard on the ears","Liking bluegrass is easy enough but liking this CD by King Wilkie is pretty hard. Though they put on a good show, I must admit that this CD flounders quite a bit. Most of the material belongs in the camp of ""I can tune my banjo & sing"" but doesn't really go past that. While their stage appearances have some professionalism, this CD really doesn't represent much in those terms. For the most part the approach is just amateur. And to boot, the sound of the CD is somewhat funky like it lacks depth and clarity."
5,Excellent rock,"Cornerstone was formed when Steen Morgsten (spelling?), bass player in Royal Hunt, decided to write his own material, and needed a band to perform it. So he got together with Doogie White (ex-Rainbow, Deep Purple), and the result was ""Arrival"", a mellow album with influences including Magnum, Dare, and the above-mentioned.Human Stain is the second album, this time co-written with Mr White, and its fantastic!The influences are the same, but the sound is better, the band are tighter, there is a rockier edge to the proceedings, and best of all, the songs are outstanding; plus they've penned songs of multiple styles from ballads to moody mid-tempo to out-and-out rockers, all executed with aplomb. Doogie's vocals are superb (Dio-ish, but cleaner), the guitarist(s) are on top form, the drummer can PLAY!, and any self-respecting fan of Purple/Rainbow/Whitesnake/Magnum/similar needs to own this asap."
2,This one fails the multi test...,"When this item arrived, I opened the package and tested it out by inserting the probes into an electrical outlet. When I removed them, one of the probes came loose from the end of the wire. This product comes with absolutely NO documentation, so unless you are very well trained in the electrical arts, or you intuitively understand all the functions of this unit, its multi-functionality will likely go largely unused..."
5,my favorite dessert book,"I love this book and not simply because lemon desserts are heaven to me. The recipes in this book seem to me to have been worked until perfection was achieved. The balance of flavors and textures is superb, and the recipe writing is clear and precise. I love the look of the book too--like lemons, bright and fresh. I have only tried 3 recipes so far (the lemon meringue pie is the best I have ever tasted), but have ordered lemon oil and plan to exhaust this book until I can bake no more."
4,Best Lemon Shortbread ever,I am a professional pastry chef and I love this book. I actually use the lemon shortbread for one of my desserts as well as the madeleine recipe. This is a great book for any bakers library.
5,So many great desserts for LEMON LOVERS!!!,"My father, the ULTIMATE LEMON LOVER, was the inspiration for me to buy this book. I wanted to make him some special treats for his birthday, so I thought this would be perfect. I was NOT disappointed. Every recipe in this book is a lemon lover's dream. I made him the classic lemon bars and the lemon sugar cookies and he was in lemon heaven. I myself love the candied lemon rind and the lemon madelines. I'm still eager to try some more of the recipes when time allows. She gives great instructions and the pictures are nice. I highly reccommend this book!!!"
5,Luscious Lemon Desserts,"As an amateur I cook mainly for myself and personal friends. In looking through cookbooks I look for recipes which produce subtle tastes and recipes that are clear and simple. Regarding her ""lemon-black pepper cornmmeal cookies"" I""ve never tasted better. This book is thoughtfully written, each word carefully weighed and each recipe carefully tested."
3,adjust the madeline recipe,"i just received this book and this is the only recipe i have used from this book so far.if you are going to make the madelines- do not put the tray on the bottom 1/3 rack in your oven as the book instructs and do not leave them in the oven for 12 - 14 minutes as the book instructs, or you will end up with brown madelines.put the tray on the center oven rack and watch the madelines until they form a slight golden cripy edge and spring back on touch. i only had to bake mine for 6 minutes and they were perfect. all 24 were eaten in less than an hour."
5,luscious lemon desserts,"My husband is a lemon fan, so I bought this book with him in mind. I've made several of the recipes, and each one of them have been wonderful. His all time favorite is the lemon strawberry shortcake. I'm looking forward to being able to purchase Luscious ChoclolateDesserts soon."
4,Luscious Indeed!,"On a whim (and because I love lemons), I checked this book out of the library. I have tried quite a few desserts from the book and all except one came out great! The oft-requested item are the Lemon Curd Bars. Everyone devours them quickly! LOL"
2,"didn't hold up-- all form, lacks function","If a kettle whistle is important to you, this doesn't have one. The OGGI Zephyr is a sleek looking kettle. However, after a few months of use, the plastic handle on the lid became lose. I would have to tighten it with a mini screw driver a few times a week. After a few months of tightening, the threads gave out. Without the plastic handle on the lid, I actually have to pry the lid off the kettle with a butter knife. All of this happened in less than 12 months from the date of purchase. I searched, but don't know where to find OGGI or their replacement parts. Time to get a new kettle; different brand!"
3,good but NOT great!,"Got this teakettle in February after reading excellent reviews, because I was so unhappy with a teakettle whose handle kept coming unscrewed. This was recommended due to the design which supposedly didn't come apart from the effect of steam and heat of a gas stove daily. The design is excellent for the most part, certainly as far as the handle is concerned. However, the fact that it doesn't whistle means it gets heated longer than necessary every time, but even worse, after only 2 months the screw which holds the little plastic shape which helps to lift the top of the tea kettle started coming undone--when we tried to tighten the screw it turned out to be held in place by some kind of 'stuffing' that melted and fell out--so there's no way to keep the screw in place now, and nothing to help remove the top of the kettle!"
3,Didn't Last Long,"This battery tester worked great for a while but then just pooped out. I bought one somewhere else and so far, it's been working great."
3,Does work really not much to it,"I don't have this black 1,what i have is a red 1 also called GBT-3502 that is a lot different from the 1 pictured.It still does the job i imagine as the black 1 does.I sometimes use it for a quick reading but not to often anymore you might say that i got bored using this.I should also point out,on the red 1 on the front indicator it shows red/low yellow green/good.According to the tester information this will do(AAA-AA-C-D-1.5v button cell and 9v batteries)will also do rechargeable 1.2 NI-MH"
1,Junk!!!!,"Measures Voltage only. This is no way to check a Battery's state of charge. Buy something like ""Delkin Devices DD/BATTEST MULTI RoHS AA/AAA Battery Power Tester"". This Tester Rocks!"
5,Organic in human language...,"This book is the perfect preparatory tool for ogranic chemistry and, in particular, mechanisms. When I entered organic, I struggled with the course because I was trying to understand what the professors and textbooks were trying to say. With this book you don't have to struggle to figure out the meaning; the author uses simple terms to describe complex problems, in a way that anyone can understand the material.To put it simply, this book = understanding organic."
2,Very disappointed,"This book has obviously been of tremendous help to many readers, but I found myself becoming more confused about Organic Chemistry than when I started reading. I felt overwhelmed by a great deal of information that didn't seem to tie back to the Org class I'm currently taking. Perhaps my learning style is just different from others who posted. Or maybe this is a book that should be read over the summer ahead of the school year, when there's plenty of time to reread sections that the student doesn't understand on the first pass.With a full-blown headache, I'm packing this book up and returning it.The only reason that I didn't go with one star is that Dr. Karty writes well, which is always appreciated."
2,None,The book does have some good info but is dated. I was hoping for illustrations and technique details. Is worth the two dollar price.
5,Not Small,"I have 2 one hundred pound glorious dogs and they love these bones. These things are a hand full with all the niblets (sp) left on. The ad makes it sound like their medium size with all the goodies shaved off, not true. Their one and half pounders, full big knuckle end of the femur. I'm putting up a pic of the actual bone in its wrapper in my hand on here too so you can see just how worth the price it is. Now if you get down to the single bone price, you might get into the ""iffy"" range. Dont forget to 'fix' your pet!"
3,"Generally good product, but didn't perfectly fit my car","I have to admit that it's hard to order a windshield screen sight unseen, even though I had relatively good assurance the size would work. Unfortunately, it wasn't obvious to me that the screen didn't include a cut-out at the top, so the window-mounted mirror became an issue. Fortunately, I can use the shield over the mirror, as the sunshades still hold it up OK. This is a good product, it just wasn't a perfect fit in my case."
5,Great Read-- Mahoney at her best!,"After reading (skimming sometimes) through Mahoney's The Singular Pilgrim, A Likely Story, and Whoredom in Kimmage, I almost didn't pick this one up. Even though I enjoyed Mahoney's tales and writing style, I didn't feel like laboring through it all once again to read about China, a country that I had little interest in. Even while my general interest in Ireland and religion (topics of her other books) was higher, I found myself not able to stop reading The Early Arrival of Dreams. The perspective she has on Chinese youth and her year living there were wonderful and interesting. I devoured this book and was left wanting to read more about China.Definitely her best work!!!"
3,Not the Worst Dexter,"...but not the best. Last Bus To Woodstock is the best Morse novel, and the later ones pale in comparison. I liked this, especially better than The Secret of Annex 3, but it still doesn't have all the twists and turns of the first.To sum up, if you've read the first, then go for this one; it won't disappoint. If you've read all but this and the last novel, by all means read this one, you'll still be content. But if you're a looking for a new mystery novelist, go for Last Bus To Woodstock."
5,Awesome,"I got this set as a gift, but it did not have the quilt, when I was able to find it on line, the color,texture and quality was right on the money."
3,"Decent, but Non-Intuitive","In analog design, one must think about how the circuit works without the numbers first. This literally is an afterthought in this book, ie. it's in the appendix. While this is a generally good book in that it contains the knowledge needed to *start* to do analog design, one would be better off with a decent electronics textbook for the theory and the ""Trinity"" of Jim Williams two books (Analog Design:A,S,and P and The Art and Science...) and the Bob Pease's (Troubleshooting Analog Circuits) for the practical stuff.I don't blame the author, since I think it is impossible to teach in a single book. Learning to do analog design requires a bit of a brain rewire, which just takes time and practice. You struggle with simple stuff for a while, then one day realize you actually know what the heck you are doing."
5,Best Information I've Ever Read,This is by far the best book I have ever read as far as food for a healthy life. It makes complete sense out of so many myths we hear everyday about different kinds of diets. This is a program for good quality living. It has information on many experiments and testing that have been done and explains the complete metabolism issue in detail. If you are interested in nutrition at all this book is a must read!
5,Science we need to know and FAT,"TURN OFF THE FAT GENE is such an effective book, I sent a copy to my son who has a wonderful figure so doesn't need the advice to turn off the fat gene. It's a really great book from which one can learn lots about what carbohydrates to eat and those to control, and what makes the fat, and what is stored in the body. Stored in the body. That's the best. I was almost a vegan when I read it, and now I am a vegan. Yes, my hand still hovers over the meat products, but I feel great. I'm not a holy vegan. I had clam chowder when I went to dinner at a restaurant a few days ago. Try this book and pass on the good word. It's terrific."
4,"You Think For No Reason I Read These? No! I Read These To Grow Wiser, Seventeen-Syllables-At-A-Time.","In some ways even funnier than Bader's other mixture of Judaism and (flimsy) Zen wisdom. These haiku do often offer nuggets of wisdom and nearly always they do it with a little joke wrapped up inside. You can read this book in about thirty minutes, contemplation time included, so why you still sitting there?"
5,Take it to shul,The rebbezin and I gained many questioning looks from other daveners - we seemed to be the only one tremendeously enjoying the sermon. Little did they know!
4,A Haiku or Two for My Review,"Book of Jew haikus,/// Some are funny, some are not,/// Whatdid I expect?You'd think maybe more,/// Than this thin little bookfor/// the money? Oy vey!(Pardon the slashes - it doesn't appear the software will allow me to print each of the haiku lines separately!) END"
1,not haiku,"Very simply, there are no haiku in this book. A shame that this book like so many others have authors thinking that they are actually writing haiku. Haiku is a classic form of poetry and these verses are haiku imposters."
4,Wholesome family entertainment!,"Wonderful, uplifting music for the whole family. Several tunes are very memorable. The native island voices are a big plus. We listen as a family while we drive and the messages are good and uplifting. (We LOVED the movie.) Adults as well as children enjoy. A very good album for our collection. When they are gone -- I'll bet they are gone for good."
4,Perfect for the whole family,"This is a great story, engaging characters.A feel-good movie that everyone in the family can enjoy.A beatiful soundtrack too."
4,Halvah Lover,"These are pretty good. I've previously had the Joyva ones. These are not as sweet, which may be a good thing!"
3,Boy book,"If this was a movie, I would call it a guy flick. A lot of blood and gore and of course the beautiful girl want's to jump the lead characters bones--only to get huffy when her needs are not met. The lead character is cast as not all that good looking, but buff and cool. I mean, do I really need to go on. Like I said guy flick, guy flick, and did I mention guy flick. It's doable as an easy read, but the editing mistakes could drive you batty."
4,Needs a good editor,"While I really enjoyed this novel, the author needs some good editing. A case in point: near the end of the novel, when Lawson is getting the stuffing knocked out of him aboard the plane, the little kid that he saved doesn't even bother to use his psychic powers to help Lawson like he did earlier in the book...duh!!!!"
2,Excuse Me,"This DVD has some great material to learn. If your chemistry works with the instructorit may work for you.My disappointment was with the teacher. The excuse me (wrong note) and rambling was unbearable.At times I forgot which song he was on because it was so draw out.After debating if this guy is the real stuff and I am just not getting it, I watched instructions of the same songs by S Grossman. It took me about 15 min to get the concept and play the song.He is a great instructor.Lucky I rented this from Netflix which I would advise before buying."
5,Good,I enjoyed the first section on his childhood which was all new to me. But what I really enjoyed was the second section on the bootlegging days. It went into more detail than I could have asked for on how he set it up and even gave some detail on some of the gun fights men like Bugsy Seigel got into. I would have liked the book better if this section would have been a lot bigger. The rest of the book was good too and supplied an interesting theory on Lucky Luciano's infamous ride but didn't go into any real detail on how he ran and operated the crime family it focused more on his personal businessess. All in all interesting (especially the bootlegging section) and a fairly good story. I recommend at least giving it a try.
1,right order number-- wrong book,I would have been delighted to have read this book whichj I ordered ALAS my order went to ABEBOOKS a mistake to be avoided-they sent me ' THE 1997 Almanac ' instead using the correct order number and refuse to take resposibility for the error but say it is between the Dealer and me.My original order went to Amazon not the unknown (to me) Abebooks.I do hope anyone lucky enough to get the correct book .i.e on Frank Costello .enjoys it you have my envyPRINCE RAFAEL
3,This should work for most people,"This book seems to do a good job of showing most people how more intelligent, analytical minds think. It breaks things down into very simple and easy to understand steps and I'm sure helps a lot of folks achieve more analytical thinking and quicker learning. However, if you already learn quite quickly and grasp commonly difficult or profound concepts easily, this book won't help you improve your learning ability further. I'm afraid I wasted my money on this book. I already think the way it tries to teach you to think. I don't want to sound snobby, but if you're envious of people around you who are really intelligent and you want to learn how to think a little bit more like them, then this book is for you.But if you see yourself as just as or more intelligent than anybody else in the world and you want to further improve your abilities, save your money."
2,Soap Box,The author seemed to be on a soap box about the public education system and how we all need to boycot. But I was able to stop cracking my knuckles using one of the methods.
1,Some Strategies Just Repackaged,"Loads of hype and salespitch! The methods described in this book are fairly flexible, but they are so hyped up that it is not easy to cope with the dissapointment after the hype. The only good part of their story is the ""search for meaning"" section of the MASTER learning method that goes some way to promoting thinking before memory.There are tons of stories and anecdotes in the pages that have already been debunked, and a good amount of serious salesmanship.One warning though! I did do a websearch on the company and found that they are currently being prosecuted for advertising against the trades descriptions act in the UK. They claimed falsly to be able to teach a foreigh language within just a few hours, amongst other such nonsense.Lots of dodgy sales methods, but no real payback!"
2,"Well Done, Just not Sure about the concept","I'm of two minds about this title-- on the one hand, it's a quality product, well written and organized.On the other hand, I didn't find the concept to be all that compelling and I didn't really gain anything from the book, other then some familiarity with the subject matter.Overall, this is a well written book but I just didn't buy into the theories."
5,"This book reminds me of Shakespeare, in that . . .","both arranged letters to form words and, thus, create sentences.It is my fervent belief that reading this book will improve your gas mileage, make you more attractive to the opposite sex, and make you live longer. In addition, the pages of this book, when burned, provide a clean, inexhaustible source of energy."
2,Why re-invent the wheel?,This has all been done before. I was expecting something fresh -- all I got was the scraps Scott Adams threw out...
2,Okay for Inside Play - I guess,"If you are looking for a frisbee to throw and catch with your dog outside - might want to keep looking. Cute toy for inside, though."
1,Pathetic,"I would enjoy this if I was say a 12 year old girl. But as a 24 year old male this music is of no appeal to me. If I want to listen to love songs I'll put on The Fray or Ray LaMontagne, or take it back and smack in some Van Morrison or Otis Redding. I don't think I have ever heard such sappy, teenage type lyrics in my life. It's so sweet that it's on the verge of being kinda 'Gay'. Not to mention all the songs sound the same it's just beating around the same bush over and over and over."
4,My son was so happy!,"I purchased this disc for my sons birthday. He knew it had been released, but we were unable to find it locally. He was thrilled and very surprised to receive it!"
1,How does this happen?,"I caught the track ""Vulnerable"" on the radio recently, and was for sure that Chris Carrabba must have started a new band, returning to his more acoustic days of The Swiss Army Romance. I got home, checked out the band on-line and realized that this was a totally different person. I honestly do not see how people get away w/ completely stealing someone's vocal styling, approach to harmonies, vocal mannerisms/enunciations, lyrical styling, and overall CONCEPT of a band!! Second hand bands are always robbing original acts of such things (just look at bands like Creed, Puddle of Mud, etc), but I don't know the last time I heard an act that was doing it this blatantly and with such ""emotional"" intent. I feel sorry for people that hear something like this and feel that the emotion is original and touching. This is musical piracy, and John Vesely should be ashamed of himself. THIS is what is wrong w/ the music industry. Very bad album."
5,Love this song!!,"My husband and I downloaded this to add to our CD favor of songs we had requested of the DJ for our wedding. We chose songs that either had a beachy/tropical feel, or had a lot of meaning to us. I actually happened upon this song while looking for processional songs, and fell in love with it! Our violinist found the music and played it as I walked down the aisle. Couldn't have been more perfect!"
5,If you like this musical buy the CD,"I bought this CD and this is a MUST for all people who love the music of My Fair Lady. I bought the CD with music never before realised, but this cd looks good too. A MUST FOR ALL MY FAIR LADY FANS."
3,The movie lover only,"When it comes to ""My fair lady,"" I prefer the original Broadway cast recording to this soundtrack. Because Audrey didn't sing! Of course, in the movie she was very wonderful and lovely. But in the soundtrack, Marni Nixon sings Eliza's songs. I have four recordings of My Fair Lady, my best is the original Broadway Cast Recording. But the orchestration by Andre Previn is by far the best. I recommend it because of this wonderful orchestration."
3,Just not the same,"As much as I love this film, I always listen to the Andrews/Harrison Broadway recordings when I'm in the mood for the score. I bought this disc for the ""unreleased tracks"" in hopes of getting Audrey's original vocals. WRONG! The extra tracks are all direct from the film's soundtrack with dialogue and other extraneous foley sounds. A real disappointment. The best thing about this one is the orchestrations of André Pevin. For Audrey's original vocal tracks get the DVD - they are included there; and she's not bad!"
2,Not worth your money,"Though I have heard other CDs featuring Marni Nixon (West Side Story and Disney's Mulan, among others), I've never heard her as weak as she is on this soundtrack. She was an incredibly poor choice for the lead. Rex Harrison is still good, however, and is the main reason I give this CD two stars. Overall, it is definitely not worth your money; get the Broadway recording instead."
2,Sorry Marni!,"I""ll take the Broaway cast album every time. Julie Andrews is simply unbeatable! If only we weren't stuck with Rex Harrison in both versions."
2,My Fair Lady Isn't So Fair,"I am a die-hard Julie Andrews fan, so that already brings it down a notch. I also really like Audrey Hepburn and the fact that she didnt do her own singing makes it seem fake.I ABSOULUTLEY HATE Marni Nixions voice on this album. her voice sounds flat and too american. Her cockney isnt the best , but i'll lay off of that because it is hard to do a good cockney if your are american.I love Rex Harrison on both albums, he is so funny! I would have loved to see Julie Andrews and Rex together to witness the chemistry between them on the OBC, it would have been marvelous! GO BUY THE ORIGINAL BROADWAY CAST ALBUM!"
4,"My Fair Lady, good.","I am sorry but i am a Julie Andrews fan a big one and although Audrey did a good job of making Eliza her own its the singing thats bad. Marni Nixon is an American and so sings with an American twang in her voice and also is not an actress and so did not put enough emotion and depth in to the lyrics as she sang, i don't thing she understud them. Not like Julie.This record got four stars from me purley for Rex Harrison as his singing and emotion he puts into his songs make this CD worthy of the cost.Listen to the broadway version with Julie though and see what i mean about Marni. Julie puts a good amount of energy in her songs especially the I Couid Have Dance All Night number."
1,Audrey Hepburn? Really? No.,"I'm really just appalled that Audrey Hepburn is credited on this soundtrack, as she never sang for the movie and Julie Andrews was the original Eliza, so there's no way in hell that Audrey Hepburn qualifies for the ""original cast"" of any music recording of this show. Otherwise it's a lovely recording and brings back old memories."
1,Not what I thougt I was buying,"I thought I was buying my dream saw. No way, I have spent almost the price of the saw to bring it up to par.The blade guard and splitter both are garbage. The miter guage is a throw away, it has no place in my shop.I have refined the saw at a high expense and have to say I am very happy but broke."
5,"""Active Spirituality"" is a Hit!","In this book, Charles Swindoll educates the reader on 22 specific areas for personal growth available by studying Solomon's Book of Proverbs. The areas of growth are clearing defined, and backed by Scripture. Each chapter of the book is concluded with specific action items, to point the reader in the right direction. It is an excellent book for anyone who wants to study and learn from Solomon's wisdom. I recommend it highly!"
4,Fun for the Young Ones!,As a teacher of 5-8 year olds this CD has proved to be useful and fun! I had the cassette tape years ago so was very pleased when I searched Amazon and found a CD version to replace the now lost tape!
2,You Get What You Pay For...,"I have this cd. It really isn't anything to write home about concerning flute recordings. For the price, you might as well get it if you collect flute related pieces but if not, you won't be missing anything."
4,Good lens especially considering the price,"I like this lens, the Macro mode is quite useful for it let you stay a comfortable distance away while still captures nice close up shots (see the shared picture samples above).Pros: cheap, light, good sharpness and constrast stoped down (f/8) especially below 200mm range, 200-300mm is softer, but usable.Cons: need to be very careful about the shooting technique, at long focal length, the small aperture makes the lens very susciptible to camera shake, steady hands and high ISO and fast shutter speed will be the key for long focal lengths. Definitely no match for the canon 70-200mm family, but then those at many many times more expensive. Soft wide open, especially at 300mm focal length. For the 300mm focal length, you really can't find anything this cheap and offer reasonable performance."
1,Not recommended,"I bought this just to carry around when I didn't want to carry one of my bigger L lenses. It seemed to fit the bill for a small light zoom. But alas not! It is slow, unsharp and generally not very good. I used it maybe twice and now it sits on a shelf collecting dust. The price is cheap and in this case, you get what you pay for. Maybe for a beginner, just starting out without a large budget for glass, this could be ok. I warn that you will want to upgrade within some time, if quality matters. I recommend a pass."
4,Great show,Don't have a lot to say. You can get the gist of what the show is about from the other reviews. Just wanted to chime in and let everyone know that this show is keeping me up late every night. Love it.
4,Smaller than it looks,"toasts evenly. it's shorter than it looks -- i'd imagine it would be fine if you mostly toast sandwich-sized commercial loaves. However, if you buy round sourdough or boules or other large loaves you may need to toast each slice separately. It is narrow, which to me is a good thing since it is easy to stow away."
4,Nice toaster,"After going to several web sites to read reviews on toasters, this one was rated high. It performs efficiently and has a very sleek design. A nice price too! Some of the higher priced toasters received much lower ratings."
3,Toaster,More catching to the eye than anything else. It needs to be a little longer to fit two pieces of relativey wide bread in the toaster at the same time. Two slices of wonderbread fit like peas in a pod though.
4,Pretty Good,Works very well and I love the bread warming rack. Only complaint is that it is bigger than I expected.
1,discontinued - so no repair service,"We received this toaster as a wedding gift and were very pleased to have a nice toaster, especially one that accommodates thicker bread. Unfortunately, only two years later, one entire side of the toaster doesn't work. I've called Braun and they tell me that the toaster has been discontinued, there are no parts and no repair service, and there is nothing they can do for me! (To add insult to injury, when I asked to speak to a manager, they blew me off by putting me on endless hold.) I thought this was a company with a solid reputation, and I've certainly been pleased with Braun products in the past. For this kind of service and better durability, we would be better off buying a cheap toaster. So would you."
2,Not for those who like light toast,"On the lightest setting (1), this toaster still makes toast darker than what I like (ok, maybe I just like warmed bread), but with 5 settings, it seems that it shouldn't make the edges of the bread black in spots. I can't imagine what the highest setting does.I looked into returning this toaster, but Amazon would have deducted the cost of my ""free"" shipping from my refund, PLUS I had to pay the postage to return it. I basically now put in frozen bread on the 1 setting, (not the frozen bread setting) and make do, since it would have cost me too much to return it."
2,burn it down,"Toaster is sleek looking, but it burnt my waffles. Have only used it 2x and both times...it burnt my waffles."
5,Braun HT600 toaster,Toaster is just like it was advertised. Works great on those big slices of sour dough bread.
4,great Toaster,"I gave this Toaster to my husband for x-mas.We love it,it makes beautiful Toast and we like the long slots for longer slices of bread.Its great looking too and fits in my kitchen cabinet.I'm from Germany and I love the Braun Products."
4,like a toaster should be,The best toaster we have ever owned. Very even toasting. Great features such as reheat. Good fit on a narrow counter. Nice finish. Have toasted a wide variety of items from bagels to hamburger buns and frozen waffles. Good results for everything.
4,not as expected with respect to space saving; performance fine,"I thought I would be able to put this slim elongated toaster against the back wall - thought that would save space. Since the controls are on the end, as a practical matter it can't be used unless it is perpendicular to the back wall, and since it's elongated it takes up 3/4 of the space from the back wall to the front of the counter. So this isn't as low profile as I thought it would be. Performance is fine."
3,How difficult is it to manufacture a toaster that makes toast?,"I purchased this toaster because I liked the design and have had good results with other Braun products. It fits well on my narrow counter and the controls are easy to use. Unfortunately, it has been very frustrating when it comes to selecting the right setting. The bread either comes out under cooked, burnt around the edges, or toasted on one side but not the other. We can put a man on the moon, but we can't make toast!"
2,"Even toasting, for lots of toasting at one time look at others","This toaster does toast evenly as promised, but I find that if I want to toast lots of bread I have to wait for it to cool down to put my next 2 slices in. The bread will not stay down if the toaster is still hot. Has anyone else seen this? I wouldn't buy this model again unless I was single. For a family, buy a 4 slot toaster."
2,Disappointing,"It looks nice. It does not toast very evenly, typically get one edge burned another not toasted."
1,Warranty Cliche,"Bought this toaster in March 2007 and loved it - at first. Stylish, toasted well, the crumb tray is a nice feature. But, the cradle that holds the bread in the toaster broke two weeks after the one year warranty expired! How's that for timing? The cradle dropped down into a position that jammed the crumb tray and prevented the on-off switch from moving down far enough to turn the toaster on, so it's now completely useless and headed for the trash."
5,Great pop music. Period!,"Being a musician myself, I tend to be tough on everyone so here goes: The songwriting is excellent and the lyrics seem real and personal - great pop tunes. The guitar work is awesome and its obvious that he studied music. The bass guitar and rhythms do exactly what they're supposed to do- bring it all together. The singer has a beautiful voice and his back up parts are tasty. All in all, I was surprised at how good this CD was, though I wish there were more cuts, I hope they release a full CD soon!"
4,Pleasantly surprised...hearing is believing!,"I like checking out new stuff and was pleasantly surprised to find that this CD delivers on all counts - good writing, good musicianship, good vocals, and most of all, original."
2,"""Low quality garage band sound""","The Turn sounds like an amateur garage band. Their lead singer's voice sounds like it is c. 1980's. His voice isn't terrible, he just needs a few voice lessons. The band in the background has a folk-rolk feel to it. The Turn overall sounds like a mix between sixties flower power music and eighties pop."
5,Neverheardthis disc,"Nick plays the riffs of Pearl Jam's ""Evenflow""...Raul says..""you know, kids like this stuff""....later in the show they each play a little bit of various songs. Nick plays the opening to Black Sabbath's ""Paranoid"", Raul sings the opening to Zeppelin's ""Houses of the Holy"". Uh, the Mavericks.....aren't they a country band?!!? At Tanglewood RAul says ""tonight we're going to bring out Pete Townshend and have a Who-tennany"" Then there's Mr. McFadyn's dancing during ""I Got You"" Oh yeah, I was there, night after night. Too bad they blew the headliner away on that tour. Is it any reason she wanted to fire them?"
4,Hats Off To Samuel Maverick,"The term, ""maverick,"" came from a Texas rancher, Samuel Maverick, who didn't brand his cattle. Later, the term would become associated with a person whotakes an independent stand, and refuses to conform. So, skip the descriptions, this is Maverick music at its best. Leave this one in your CD tray or changer, and you'll be finding reasons not to take it out, even if you've just heard it! And then, you've the added temptation of buying the import version of ""Super Colossal,"" known alternately as ""Best Of"" and ""Now And Then,"" with three additional tracks! The Mavericks just keep getting better and better, and that's the unbranded truth."
5,Great Value,This rug is great. Its a nice size and good quality. The colors are bold and makes a room look great. Its a great rug for the price!
5,Gift,This product was purchased for a gift and (for this reason) was purchased with some hesitancy. A worry that was not necessary ... as the quality and appearance delighted the recipient.
3,My Dad,"The CD was exactly what I wanted. My father passed away over 20 years ago but probably 40 years ago, on Father's Day, I gave him the 45 record of the title song. The song was the perfect way to tell him how I felt about him and, even today, I think a father would be proud to have his children feel like the character in the song. Give it to your father and see his reaction!!! (I gave the CD only 3 stars because the rest of the songs are not the best -- but I only wanted the one song anyway.)"
2,Probably?,"If you are looking for THE RISING TIDE PART II, this ain't it, honey. I found this record to be lacking in the traditional pop and melody sensibilities that made TRT so special and beautiful.Prog? Probably. Sweeping, passionate and beautiful? Probably not.Sometimes I can get by with Jeremy's voice alone, as I did on the Frog Prince. This time I took the CD over to the ""sell your stuff"" store."
1,Yanni Meets Sting in a Tofu House Squabble,"I have never been more disappointed with an album in my entire life. I waited over a year for this, and already have pawned it off for $6 to my local used CD store.Fans of Enya, Yanni, and Sting will go nuts with this stuff, and fans of SDRE will be shocked, sad and left speechless.""Its over,"" is the only song worth listening to, and as the title states, its over for most SDRE fans.I understand that bands change, and their musical styles evolve and progress with time. Yes, I know that this is not SDRE, and that they have every right to do something completely different. However on every Fire Theft Concert Poster and on their web site, they go out of their way to say, ""The Fire Theft, Formerly known as Sunny Day Real Estate."" I guess whatever they need to do to trick people into buying their CD."
4,have patience,"it took over 4 weeks to receive this CD, which is waaaay too long, but the CD is fine."
4,Kind of glitchy,"Most of the time it works but then every once in a while it has a hiccup and you have to stop for a few seconds and unjam it. However, it is handy when you need to do a lot of stripping. I imagine that other automatic strippers have similar issues as this one. It was relatively cheap so I would buy again.Experience level in relation to the tool: medium-low"
2,Very poor for 22 gauge wire,"The 22 gauge slot is so far over to one side that the grippers either have a hard time catching the wire or they catch it at such an angle as to break the wire instead of stripping it. It works fine for other gauges, but fails when it comes to the small stuff."
2,Poor materials,"I've had this stripper for less than 2 years. The clamp part that is supposed to hold the wire down no longer works well. It is usually stuck in the open position and you have to fiddle with it for some time. A lot of the metal including the screws are rusted. Never got it wet, must be from humidity alone. I'm looking for a better wire stripper for smaller gauge wires."
5,BEST ONE I GET..,"If you like FLAVOR and Southern cooking, you need this in your collection. I will never stop getting this Mag. It does have a lot of spice and heat to the recipes but you can always adjust that according to your level of tolerance! What is fun are all the recipes from the best places, reviews of restaurants in different regions and they feature different cusines each issue, Mexican, Cajun, BBQ which are all just excellent. I have kicked up my cooking a notch with this mag. and have found many new recipes my family just raves about.GET IT...you won't find it easily in the stores...SUBSCRIBE!!SJW in Michigan"
1,where's my magazine?????????????????????????,"I have read Chile Peeper for years. I ordered a subscription on Amazon on October 2, 2011. It is now December 14, 2011. The ship date for my FIRST magazine is FEBRUARY 1, 2012!!!!!! WHY DOES IT TAKE FOUR (4) MONTHS TO GET A MAGAZINE THAT IS PUBLISHED EVERY TWO (2) MONTHS?????????????????EAGERLEY AWAITING WHAT HAD BETTER BE A REALLY GOOD EXCUSE!!!!!!!!!BOB TUCKER"
2,Not as advertised,"Like a few other reviewers, I also received a product that is different than what is being depicted on Amazon. The toothbrush, toothpaste and soft finger brush are there, but in the place where it shows the stack of doggy mints, there is another identical soft finger brush. I can't fathom why I would want two of them. In addition to the picture being inaccurate, the product description on this page clearly states: ""Comes with toothpaste, pet toothbrush, soft pet finger brush for hard to reach places and 6 chewable breath mints."" The back of the actual package says ""Dental kit includes: Toothpaste, Pet Toothbrush, 2 Soft Pet Finger Toothbrushes"" so it's clear that Amazon is at fault, misrepresenting what product they actually have for sale.Don't order this unless you want two of the finger brushes and no chewable mints."
5,Complete Package for All Your Dog's Mouth-Cleaning Needs,"This package is great if you have no experience with cleaning a dog's teeth as the finger brushes are excellent for hard to reach places on dogs with long snouts as well as for starting off any dog with a teeth cleaning regimen. The brushes are good for a wide variety of dog sizes, and the dogs definitely love the toothpaste taste."
5,My Dog does not mind it.,"I have tried this product twice on my hound dog, and she does not seem to mind. I definitely recommend you let them taste the toothpaste before brushing. I never brushed a dog's teeth before and I did not have any problem. A very good Dental Kit."
3,"Good, if your dog likes the toothpaste","Our corgi doesn't mind the finger brushes, but the toothpaste is another story. I tried to get him to like it, but he licks it and then shakes his head in disgust. Also, my kit did not come with the breath mints, as shown, just two finger brushes, a regular brush, and toothpaste. We will continue to use the brushes, but I will try to find a different flavor of toothpaste. Three stars for the brushes."
5,great lyrics.....great music,This is a great buy! The lyrics are honest and real. Take a listen and you'll be glad you did! The songs do not all sound the same like some other groups. Check it out!
5,Back to the Innocence Rocks!,"I think the music on ""Back to the Innocence"" really rocks!!! It's great, positive music! The songs are all very catchy with great hooks and meaningful lyrics. It may not be the ""new"" sound, but what is nowadays? Isn't just being good, good enough? In a time when music seems to be so angry and self-gratifying, it's good to hear something with a positive vibe that leaves you walking away with a good feeling. ""Walk along with me, walk along with me...."""
4,A Pleasant Surprise,"I bought this CD with caution, figuring that this was just another band whose CD couldn't stand up to the quality of the first single (""Walk With Me""). But I've really enjoyed it. None of the tracks really has the same feel as WWM, but that's a good thing. The lyrics address a variety of topics that each demand their own style of accompaniment. I especially like the slow ""I Pray"" and the ridiculously catchy ""Say It's So,"" as well as the title track.The sticker on the front of the album says it carries a promise from the band that ""every song counts."" They mean it, y'all."
5,Seven adn the Sun Values,"I saw seven adn the sun when I was over at my friends house watching jay leno.. or the late show.. I dont know.. it was like 1 in the morning. but I heard a familiar song, called walk with me.. and it was great. so I went and bought the cd. you should buy it because it has good values in their lyrics. Theyre not some cheap made up lyrics, but they are true.. and filled with thoughts and emotions. Their friendly lyrics and nice music flows greatly together, which is great for anyone who likes easygoing and fun music. I listen to it whenever Im just chillin at my house.. its great.. I reccomend you to buy it."
5,McKenzie Westmore,"Hey! This is such a great CD! I watch Passions All the time! I am so glad that McKenzie Westmore *Sheridan Crane* just married the lead singer! Now they are going to have a baby! Go Kenzie! Oh yeah, this CD is awesome! Esepically WALK WITH ME!"
4,Pop With Meaning,"Seven and the Sun does contemporary POP justice with its debut album Back to the Innocence. From the opening excitement of Jump to the debut single Walk With Me & the title track Back to the Innocence, there are NO throw away songs. The message conveyed is positive and uplifting, something that seems to be lacking in today's music. If you are looking to check out POP with meaning, check out this band. You will not be disappointed."
5,Right to my heart!,I thought the songs were all great... the lyrics on black and blue just hit home for me and back to the innocence lifted me up..i think thw whole record takes you through a range of emotions and the more you listen to it the more you need to hear!I have not bought a record so complete in so long..The songs are great the voice is awesome and and the music is perfect...buy it and you will love it.....
2,Had promise.....!,"Have to say some of the songs are catchy but come on?...""Bono"" let's be real, Seven is more like ""nsync"" Some of the songs have promise but the production is lame, it is the same basic formula. When will American Lables grow a set and try something new rather then play it safe. The songs could have been a lot more. But the mindless masses will probably buy it because its all the Record companies give us and they are going to shove it down our ears. And they wonder why we download and don't buy. Please don't make the comparison with the likes of Bono or others. This is most certainly not orginal or groundbreaking."
1,Do yourself a favor and pass on this one...,"Has to be the most forced contribed [junk]I have heard in a long time. Lets take some early 90's pop and add some distorted guitar mixed with acoustic and call it new. I could go into detail on exactly why this [stinks] but it would take you a day and half to read it. If your really want it just download it, but don't waste the money unfortunatly I did because my girlfriend heard one of the songs on Passions and thought she liked it till she really listened to it. Basically a lame version of Matchbox Twenty or any other band like that."
4,The Best of Three in my opinion,"I sat down in Border's for an hour over a cup of coffee and perused all three books on PhotoImpact 7. I ultimately purchased this one as I think it works best as a supplement to the manual as opposed to rehashing what already is in the manual. After purchasing the book and having gone through it at home with my computer, I went back to Borders and relooked at the other two to see if maybe they offered something else, but they really didn't."
5,Aptly titled CD,"If you are looking for a CD to sit back and relax with, this is it. Every cut is wonderful. And if you listen they are not just relaxing but clever and inventive takes on great standards. I play it many times a week."
3,Both bikes broken shortly after purchasing.,"We own half a dozen Calico Critter sets, and they are indescribably cute; however, we had little luck with this set. Perhaps it was coincidence, but both bikes broke within two weeks of purchase. They seemed rather fragile at the cross-sections. The durability has been a mixed lot with the animals, as well. For example: the bunny family's tails all fell off within the first week and another's fur all rubbed off on its extremities from articulation. My daughter is honestly quite gentle with her things so this is odd wear. I feel, for the price of these playthings, we ought to be getting as much consistency in the durability as the cute-factor."
1,From the factory to the world... not France,"This would be a reminder to Amazon that they should state the country of origin for everything. I will not buy from the off-the-original-shore factories unless there is zero choice. No, I don't mean that I won't buy foreign... it means that I will not buy products from countries which do not care what it is they are producing... countries which have bargain priced workers... ready to do their best to make whatever they are asked to make. I want products that have heart. If it is a Chinese or Indian product that is part of the culture of that nation... then I am interested... but I do not want French stoneware made in Thailand or American furniture made in the People's Republic of China. As of today, here is what it says on the Amazon page featuring this product: ""About Le Creuset...Since 1925, artisans have been crafting Le Creuset cookware in the French village of Fresnoy Le Grand."""
3,BE CAREFUL! Le Creuset from TAIWAN!!!!,"This product seems to be performing OK, although it is not made in France.AMAZON SHOULD NOTIFY THAT IN THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION PARAGRAPH. I STILL BELIEVE THAT LE CREUSET PRODUCTS MADE IN FRANCE ARE BETTER THAN TAIWANESE. I HOPE SOMEONE WILL CHALLENGE THAT SOON BECAUSE I DO NOT PLAN TO PURCHASE ANY MORE LE CREUSET PRODUCTS FROM AMAZON."
2,Le Creuset made in Thailand!,"Ordered this item back in April as a Mothers Day gift for my wife as an addition to her Le Creuset set. The box was not opened until today (Mothers Day). My wife brought to my attention that the bar code label indicated it was made in Thailand and that it was ""stoneware"", not cast iron. At first we thought it might be a ""knock off"" since neither my wife or myself realized Le Creuset was made of anything but cast iron (I ordered it and am not a Le Creuset expert since the add on Amazon did say ""stoneware""). So, after figuring out that the item was most likely a genuine Le Creuset product we felt better but will be wary of low prices for otherwise expensive products...to be honest I figured it was a clearance item was price to ""move"" and didn't take the cast iron vs. stoneware into account. The product is fine and my wife is happy since...it's the thought that counts but as I said, I'll pay closer attention to low prices in the future."
1,We got ours broken,"We had this in our wedding registry and we got it broken. It was very poorly packaged, just some thin cardboard between the dish itself and the lid.We got a certificate for the amount, and I would really like to order another one, but I am afraid it is going to come broken again. More, we have to pay again $30 for shipping and, who knows how it will come again.I cannot really rate the item, since I was not able to use it. If I get it next time I order it (and it seems like a great dish for a big party), I will rate it again."
4,Relatively new to the strip,"I have read Baby Blues on and off in the local paper for the past several years. Having not received the paper on a regular basis has prevented me from sticking with it consistently. However, I have historically enjoyed it when I read and decided to start picking up the treasuries to play a bit of a game of catch-up. They weren't all readily available and I'm a bit of a stickler for reading in some degree of order. As a result, I started with the first of the series that I could readily find.As expected, it was very entertaining and made brought an audible chuckle on more than one occasion. Thoroughly enjoyable. I would happily recommend. Next up for me: Framed - Baby Blues Treasury"
5,Great DINO book for TODDLERS,"My 2 yr. old son loves dinosaurs and we got this book at our library. Practically every page was ripped (seemingly by the hands of other dino-loving toddlers) and mended with strips of tape. I am dreading the return of this book to our library so I am purchasing it for a low price here. It has simple & bright pictures and short text for short attention spans. It even ends with ""sleepy dinosaurs"" with their eyes closed for that perfect segway to bedtime!"
5,"A ""Must Have""","This is literally our son's FAVORITE book. He's 10 months now and we've been reading it to him since he was probably 6 or 7 months old. We read a variety of books - usually 2 or 3 each night - and he usually wants to read this book after all the others. I swear it helps him go to sleep. For younger kids of his age, I highly recommend the board book version if you can get it - it's the perfect size for little hands. I LOVE THIS BOOK!"
4,Good dinosaur book for young kids,"My 3 year old really enjoys this book (he first read it at school). This is great for young kids and toddlers because it doesn't depict dinosaurs as scary monsters. This is the only dinosaur book my son likes because of this. The pictures are very colorful and the story is simple, and each page shows different dinosaurs and their characteristics. This is a great first dinosaur book."
2,Redundant,"Sorry but this book was difficult to finish reading. My son would laugh and say...""is it almost over...let me guess, Houdini escapes.."". We felt that the plot was redundant. On a positive note, the book is good for expanding your vocabulary."
5,a great book for all ages,"This is a hilarius book! It's an autobiography of a hamster named Houdini. He has all sorts of adventures. If you have ever read the Hank the Cowdog series, the humor in this book is something like that, so if you like Hank the Cowdog, you'll like this book. But even if you don't like Hank the Cowdog, you'll like this book."
3,"Wonderful storytelling, but...........","No doubt, these finely crafted, interwoven stories will delight many readers, but.... If you're considering this collection because you loved the adventure and danger of Voyage of the Narwhal, reconsider. These stories are as quiet and subtle as Voyage is exciting."
5,The drummer's technique bible,"If you are thinking about improving your technique, this is the book for you. This a definite classic that should be on your drumming book shelf along with the invaluable tomes by Ted Reed, George Lawrence Stone, Charles Wilcoxin, and other's that have become known as bibles to our trade. The fundamental differences with this book is that Joe wrote it, he included definitive instructions and suggestions for each section, and he tells you creative ways to apply this book to the drumset. He leaves it open as far as which direction you take through the book. Whether you apply the rebound ala Joe, or you are more into the Tony Williams/Alan Dawson method, this book is awesome!"
3,Great drummer,"Joe Morello is a great drummer but IMHO this book is a bit hard to follow compared to any Ted Reed book or Jim Chapin book. I like the book , it's just that the other authors are easy to learn from and follow on a daily basis....just my opinion. Joe is a great drummer and teacher! Also check out Ted Reed's book for the bass drum and drum solos. Chapin's 'Advanced Techniques For The Modern Drummer ' is a classic that I use with my students also. Better layouts than 'Master Studies'."
3,A lot of material,"I don't think that this book is very useful without a teacher. An enormous amount of exercises are presented to improve speed, endurance and control, but there is no logical sequence (as the author himself states). The problem is that one has to evaluate his own weaknesses to understand which kind of exercise he's really in need of. Frankly, I find those exercises a bit boring. Morello's previous work, ""Rudimental Jazz"" (no longer available apparently) is much better."
4,Rating: Very Good/ Excellent,"The book I ordered arrived on schedule, was well packaged, and exactly what I wanted. Thank you..."
4,real hip hop but short...,"Taraach is a under rated and slept on prodcer. He can spit a solid flow when given the chance and can put together a beat that will touch you your soul. His vibe on ever track stands out and makes you want the beat to be longer. The only down fall is that is short, but it a good album and will be one you remember."
5,Just the best!,"This product is not always available locally, but is worth ordering the several boxes from Amazon. Not too sweet or salty, and as near huskless as popcorn can be, it is a treat that does not need to wait for autumn evenings."
5,bestest!,"This is the best micro popcorn ever. I was looking for the sweetend kettle corn and when this arrived and I saw it was similar to, what I would compare to hot air corn, I was skeptical. I thought it would be dry and flat. I plan to buy this again and never another brand."
3,Not so good,"I'm a sucker for good kettle corn and usually buy Orville Redenbacher. However, they are moving towards that bag-into-a-bowl version which isn't as good and gives you less product, so I decided to give Black Jewell a try. It turned out to be less than ideal; the kernels are smaller than Orville and there are just as many hulls. Thumbs down. Also, this product cannot be returned to Amazon per their policy."
4,Light and tasty,"Has a very nice light Kettle Corn taste...we were used to the pop-secret kettle corn, but, is no longer available.this compares or exceeds very nicely..it all pops up well, very few old maids"
1,Old?.,Did not pop completely. Left 30% of the kernels unpopped and what did pop was hully and tough. Would not buy again.
1,Worst Popcorn!,"My husband bought two cases of this popcorn based on all the 5-stars reviews. We waited over 2 weeks for delivery. What a disappointment!!! Tiny pieces of popcorn. Lacks kettle corn flavor. Then, he contacts Amazon.com about returning it. Nope, they won't take it back. BAD experience all the way around!"
4,A Solid Noire Thriller,"Don't expect to revisit the movie in this novel, but the noire genre comes through in the writing which is fast paced and constantly exciting. Buchan creates believable characters in a tangled plot of intrigue and espionage. I'm starting John Buchan's Greenmantle next and expect an equally enjoyable read."
4,entertaining,"I got this free ebook on my Kindle because the reviews sounded good and I had seen Hitchcock's ""The 39 Steps"" movie. I've just checked the movie out again from the library as I haven't seen it in awhile & I'd like to watch it again after having read this book, which it was adapted from. The book is quite a bit different from the movie, although the main character has the same name, Richard Hannay. The movie has a romance as well (which I like) while the book is simply pure adventure. The basic basic plot is the same pretty much with the hero on the run from both the bad guys and the police and trying to figure out what the spies are up to, with dire national consequences looming. But they changed things around quite a bit when the book was adapted into the movie. They're both good (not usually true; I normally find the book much better than the movie). A good entertaining read; good clean adventure."
4,Memories,"Great memories of having read it in the early 1960s and pleasant recall of those memories in the very recent re-read.For me, it was mainly a trip down memory lane and the contrast of the writing of that era compared with now was of interest. Contemporary writing would have depicted more violence - not to say that ""The Thirty-Nine Steps"" was without violence.The genre depicted was the forerunner of the ""James Bond"" series."
4,Very good tale.,"Enjoyed the novel which created at least two movies containing suspense, intrigue, and danger for the protagonist. Fast read good story."
4,"Spies, Scotland and Suspense,","Great read - full of action, espionage, double crosses and narrow escapes. Don't expect it to replicate the Hitchcock movie or you might be disappointed. I recommend reading it and then seeing the movie again. Makes you appreciate the book even more."
3,39 Steps,"Very enjoyable, fast moving but rather stilted and dated ( in a way this adds to its charm)Would consider another Buchan novel"
5,Great theatre version of a calssic film.,"A very nice version of the film, which was based on the novel, adapted for the theatre. An excellent piece with great comedy moments and suitable for an audience of any age."
3,Review of The Thirty Nine Steps,"This an old fashioned thriller which keeps the reader enthralled to the last page. My only complaint is that it was a bit short. The central character is like the type that Robert Ludlum used to write about, where practically everybody is after him and he has to use every ingenious device he can to avoid capture. I can thoroughly recomend this book."
5,A Suspenseful Race to the Finish,"This is a fabulously atmospheric yarn which starts with a murder in London, is followed by a suspenseful chase through the moors, mountains and streams of Scotland and ends with a nail biting thud on the coast of England. Who will get to Richard Hannay first? You'll just have to read it to find out. Great fun."
1,Odious thriller,"Englishman John Hannay stumbles upon a plot to assassinate the Balkan consul and must evade enemy agents until he can alert the authorities. I have not seen the classic thriller that Alfred Hitchcock made from this material, but he obviously found something in it that I cannot. The prose is serviceable, but the plotting is atrocious; Hannay always finds just what he needs to get out of any scrape. Surrounded on the moors with no cover in sight? No problem! Here's a Scotsman working on the road who would rather be home recovering from a hangover. And his clothes fit, too! Next challenge, please!The alcoholic Scotsman also exemplifies another vice of this story, author John Buchan's unfortunate propagation of racism and offensive stereotypes. A number of gratuitously nasty remarks about Jews pop up here and there apropos of nothing. This sprinkling of odious little surprises throughout the narrative makes for an unpleasant reading experience."
3,The 39 Steps - Danielle De Gendt,"I saw the movie; the 39 steps. At first I thought it was an old-fashion detective story, but I was wrong. I found the story a bit funny, at times predictable, but I enjoyed the film. I really don't like detectives, but this film was quite good."
2,More and more outlandish,As if the Man Who Was Thursday was wriitten with a straight face. Nice descrptive passages of the Highlands though
4,Different from the movie,"High adventure, serious chases, and master disguises play against WW1 background. Although very different from the movie, The 39 Steps, this is a very good read."
4,Not as credible as the 1st edition.,Atwell was inspiring and convincing in her 1st edition. She's less convincing now that she uses anecdotal examples from her daughter and students from her private school.
2,I remember when this was called Pole Position,"I thought this game would be great, ...Graphics are solid, but the cars are nearly impossible to steer. This is a repackaged ""Pole Position"" for the 2000's. If you hit another open-wheeled car at 190 mph, it should go flying off the track into thousands of pieces. It doesn't."
3,Computer Game for the Xbox,"Clearly, this game is a direct port from the F1 computer game. That's not necessarily a bad thing. I do enjoy the game, but you should manage your expectations before you play it the first time.The graphics are a straight port, so don't expect anything better than a normal PC game with an average 3D card. The game is very detailed and enjoyable to play, which is very important.I'm not as huge an F1 fan, but I really enjoy open wheel racing, and this is really the only option you have at Xbox launch. To sum up, if you're an open wheel racing fan, this is a good buy, if you just want to race, look into Project Gotham Racing and NASCAR Thunder."
5,Beautiful Music By A Master,"When Sylvain Luc picks up the guitar, he seems to breathe fresh life into the instrument. This is probably due to the fact that like all great musicians, the music is inside him and the guitar is just a means of getting it out for the rest of the world to hear. On this album, Sylvain is in perhaps my favorite setting for him playing solo and sometimes with him overdubbing some rhythmic or bass work on his guitar. There is nothing bad about this album that i can find to tell you. If you like his interesting approach to jazz, this is a must. He is one of the greatest living musicians today. Also, check out his other albums especially ""Trio Sud""."
2,Poor quality knife,"I bought three of these Gardner Bender KF-200 knives to replace my missing Camilus Electrician's knives. The blade lock is defective on two of them. The blades have ridges along the sides where they were poorly ground, and the blades are hard to open."
1,"fine, as a child's toy",I was working on an elderly woman's computer desk when this tool just flew apart. She was insightful enough to point out that it had no locks to prevent the blades from closing onto your fingers when you're trying to separate thighs and wings. She ran into the room minutes later and clobbered me with a frozen chicken.
3,Brian May - 'Back To The Light' (Hollywood),"'Back To...' is apparently a very personal reflection of some rather unpleasant experiences May had dealt with within a five year period around the time this CD was released.A painful divorce,the death of his father and Freddie Mercury's death.An interested collection of tunes here,with a couple of guest appearances.Fellow ex-Queen member bassist John Deacon shows up on ""Nothin' But Blue"" and veteran drummer Cozy Powell(R.I.P.)co-wrote ""Resurrection"".Other good cuts include the instrumental ""Last Horizon"",his Humble Pie remake ""Rollin' Over"",""Let Your Heart Rule Your Head"" and ""I'm Scared"".Wanted to note that May's guitar playing here is good,but his singing is not so great.Being a fan of Queen for several years,it's sort of tough to get real excited about this solo effort.After maybe four spins,you'll probably want to place it in your 'play very seldom' CD stack,like I did."
2,Embarrasingly Bad,"Brian May sings on this album like he sings on all his self sung compositions with Queen, like a 300 pound man were sitting on his chest while he was singing. With a weak voice like this its not hard to see why the better Roger Taylor sang most of the backing vocals on Queens live albums and the songwriting goes from silly to horrendous Boring despite some good guitar work and competent musicianship otherwise this monstrocity is even worse then Freddie Mercurys 1985 Mr. Bad Guy."
5,The Guv'nor at his very best,"""Back To The Light"" is a masterpiece which hasn't recieved even a fraction of the acclaim it deserves. Brian May's amazingly versatile adaptable voice allows him to make everything from hard rock, through tongue-in-cheek ballads, to hauntingly sad songs his own. Each song is a jewel, each note a treasure. The songs are immaculate and technically perfect, without skimping on emotion. This should go down in history as one of the best albums to come out of the 20th Century."
4,The Extended Royal Family,"""Back To The Light"" is Brian May's first full solo CD away from Queen. Overall this is still his best solo CD. His second solo CD ""Another World"" contained some of the best songs that Brian May ever wrote, (Why Don't We Try Again"", ""Wilderness""). However ""Back To The Light' is a more consist CD. From start to finish these twelve songs all sparkle. Tracks like ""Just One Life"", ""Resurrection"", ""Driven By You"" and ""Let Your Heart Rule Your Head"" will definately evoke memories of Queen. Other songs like ""I'm Scared"" and the wonderful instrumental ""Last Horizon"" showcase sides of Brian May that were seldom heard in Queen. Like the music of Queen, Brain May's solo work ranges from soft piano ballads, to guitar driven pop rock, to heavy rock. Brian May handles the the lead vocals , as well as all of the guitar, along with some bass, keyboards and backing vocals. Queen fans would do well to add this and Brian May's other solo CD's to thier Queen collections."
3,Different from second edition.,"If you're thinking of getting this instead of the second edition for a class, don't. It's not in the least bit similar."
2,Checksoft 2006 home and business,returned product because it was difficult for me to use and not what I wanted. Returning the product to company was easy. I would do business with them again if they had a product I want.
1,More than a book---A MESS!,"Save your money! The reader who called this a muddled mess was right. I couldn't believe that after reading this book, I came to Amazon expecting to find many negative reviews, but instead found only one reader who dared call this book what it is. I also couldn't help but notice that all the positive reviews so far are from New York, coincidentally where the publisher is located. Hmmm, could it be we have another mystery?This book has so much purple prose you would almost mistake it for an Anne Rice novel instead of a ""scholarly"" historical tome. I'd say more, but my review would only echo the other negative review here. And unlike the author of this mess, I not only know when too much really IS too much, but I know how to keep on track and not distract from my point by adding completely unnecessary information."
5,It's perkin's world -- we're just visiting it.,"A recent reviewer here complained of all the detail Wroe offers; gotta differ with him. It's true that ""The Perfect Prince"" isn't a quick read, and that you have to be willing to pay attention, but give Wroe some time and focus and you'll be well rewarded. I closed the book feeling that I'd come as close as I could not only to the mysterious Perkin but to the politics, the frame of mind, and the physical texture of the world he lived in.And did I mention that the book was enthralling from start to finish? It is."
2,Were there two versions of this book???,"I have to agree 100% with the one and two star reviews. It does, indeed, appear that those who gave it 5 stars must have been reading an entirely different book! I have read extensively about English history, especially this particular time period, and am very familiar with most of the ""characters"". Nevertheless, while attempting to read this book, it was hard to remember WHO it was supposed to be about. The book seemed a total mish-mash to me, and extremely hard to follow. The author seemed to go off on way too many convoluted tangents. As much as I wanted to like this book - due to the supposed subject matter - I found that I just didn't have the stamina to finish it! I added the second star for effort."
1,Wha' happened?,"Add my voice to the chorus below condemning this ""book"" as an incomprehensible, boring, and narratively incoherent mishmash at the core of which, buried among the pointless ""look how much research I've done!"" asides, the laughably inept attempts at lyrical writing, and the annoying chronological jumble, is a great story, not at all well told. I have no problem with difficult (good) writing, or with keeping track of all the Richards, Henrys, Edwards and the like, which is a necessary part of any study of English political history, but an author who makes her readers work as hard as Ms. Wroe would have us toil -- with negligible reward -- is doing those readers no favors. I'm not really sure what editors do, but this one needed one, badly, and didn't get it. To be fair, I did like one thing about the book: the appendix contains a very good Family Tree of the Houses of York and Lancaster. Royal family trees are cool, but not for $35 (plus tax). Skip it hard."
4,Fascinating tale by a master stylist,"As with her dazzling ""Pontius Pilate,"" Anne Wroe breathes new life into the biography form while bringing to light the fascinating life of Perkin Warbeck.While her almost pointillist detail may frustrate those (like the reviewer who calls himself ""a voracious reader"" who's read more than 10,000 books) who prefer a Cliff's Notes approach to biography, the more descerning reader will delight in the wealth of research wed to the prose of this master stylist.Superb!"
2,Product/Dealer,"TOOLS ARE GOOD. HOWEVER,PRODUCT HAS WEAK CASE FOR WEGHT OF TOOLS. DO NOT BUY FROM TOOLPIA. WHEN I TOLD THEM CASE WAS BROKEN AND THAT IT SHOULD BE PACKAGED BETTER THEY SHIP A NEW ONE OUT THE SAME WAY AND IT ALSO CAME IN BROKEN. I HAVE MADE REPEATED ATTEMPTS TO CONTACT THEM BUT THEY REFUSE TO REPLY TO MY EMAILS."
1,Not really about anything,"This book isn't really about anything. It is mostly little details about various events in the lives of the two sisters, with no actual point or meaning. There is in fact very little about weight loss, weight loss surgery, or the changes that took place in the girl's life after she had the surgery. Most of the book is dedicated to endless details about parties that the sisters held and shopping trips they took. There is also a one-and-a-half page quote from Alice in Wonderland. There are far too many trivial details and far too little actual interesting content regarding what Allison went through.What's more, this book isn't even in the first person. It's by the SISTER of someone who had weight loss surgery, so really has no idea what the experience is like. When I saw the book I bought it, curious as to how a story of human tragedy and triumph can be interesting when told from the point of view of someone who wasn't even there. Now I know: it can't."
5,"Insightful, well written and informative","After having read Passing for Normal, Wilensky's first book, I was delighted to see she had another on the shelves! She is a terrific writer with a knack for getting at the heart of family (in this case sibling) relationships. This book takes the reader through the twists and turns of sibling rivalry, jealousy and love in a very thoughtful and refreshing way."
4,Going for the masterpiece jugular,"This is the greatest Suede album, if only for ambition alone. It is obvious that Brett Anderson and Bernard Butler, as disparate as they reportedly were around the time of writing and recording, were going for the jugular on this album, striving for a masterpiece. The opening 4 songs, capped by the amazing ""Wild Ones"", start Suede on the road to greatness, but the rest of the album is largely uneven. For every song as good as ""The New Generation"", there is a near-miss like ""The Two of Us"". Still, this album is Suede's finest, a compelling testament to the fruitfulness of the now-defunct Anderson/Butler songwriting partnership."
4,No Easy Listening...,"This CD's cover really pleased me. The naked guy laying on a naked bed in decadent room really conquered me. I had not heard about these guys flamboyant guys before. Their music is not easy ""to swallow"", you've got to learn how to appreciate is sour taste. But once you get started, there is no way back, they won't let you go.. The last time I thought about writing a review for them I was considering giving it only 3 stars."
5,1996 anticipated in 1994,"if it is true - what many of us believe - that 1996 was the epitome of the 1990s then suede anticipated that year with their record already in 1994. each song is miraculously overdone in a way that makes you want to sit and contemplate the sadness that you are going through. one of the greatest records ever - from one of the worst live bands ever (sorry, to say, this is true, gave them three trials: dusseldorf, cologne, hamburg - it never worked out.) doesn't matter. this record is f*a*n*t*a*s*t*i*c"
3,I WANT to love this album!,"I love Suede's debut. It's brilliant, it's sensational, it's sexy, vibrant, galactic...I was so excited to read Amazon reviewers' enthusiatic take on this album. Better than the original? I bought it immediately.There are a few good points, for sure, but mostly I feel like I am listening to the musical Cats (for which I have no fondness). I am not joking, Andrew Lloyd Weber and Michael Crawford instead of Anderson and Butler.I've been meditating on this album for months, and I still can't love it. I am so frustrated. I am even listening to it right now. Give me, give me, give me the power to LOVE it!Right now, three stars.I leave you with this: CATS"
3,"Too Long, Too Tiring","It's pretty clear that this one isn't fresh, crispy and smoothly enjoyable like their debut but I don't think its complexity suggest brilliancy at all. The order of the songs might be the problem, keeping all the slow ones to the end, though it's also possible that the actual choice of songs is responsible for this leaping fiasco. As a matter of fact this album had the potential to be incredible if it didn't include 'two of us' and 'black and blue'. Were they written with intentions to go to the eurovision song-contest? Was it because of the inclusion of these two that Butler left? Frankly, this is not the Suede I totally fell in love with, ""Keeping me on the boil"", Making me buy live bootlegs before this one was released, desperate to hear more of the Butler's guitar-fuel. 8 years later, I'm at last willing to let go. Suede's debut was a one-off."
3,Well...,"Honestly, I don't know what the big fuss over Dog Man Star is about. Granted, ""The Wild Ones"" is one of the most beautiful songs I ever heard, but the rest of the album is pretty flat. Put your money on Coming Up or Head Music instead."
3,"Very, Very hard",These were too hard for my old (16yr old) lab to enjoy. Best for young dogs that like to chew.
5,Best Welded Base Bottle Jack You Can Buy,I've purchased many bottle jacks in my line of work and have broken many as well but this one is the best of all. It has been through serious abuse and has not failed me yet. Definitely the best you can buy for the money.
4,4 1/2 stars - Will make getting MCSA a bit easier.,"The newest version of the Network+ exam from CompTIA has been updated to more current technology, Microsoft Press has put together one of the better books on the subject and it can works as self study or in a formalized classroom environment.The book does cover every exam objective in order, and although is does give a ""Microsoft"" slant to the picture, this book still works well. There are 50 lessons with over 40 exercises, and in the next edition there could be more added.There was also an lab manual included with 19 more labs consisting of over 55 exercises, most of which seemed right on the objective target. I also like the cd included with 120 day evaluation of Windows 2000 Server.The other cd has the e-book, several flash demos about the only thing missing is some sort of practice exams software, which can also be added to the next edition. Overall this book makes working towards the MCSA quite a bit easier."
3,Sam Cook is a great writer.,"Reading Friendship Fires was an experience for me. I usally don't read books that are about the wilderness, but this time I did and I'm glad becuase I learned that being advantures in life can bring you to discover many new oportunitys. I liked the way Sam Cook related his advantures with his family and brought them with, threw out is jorneys. This is a man of great character and I enjoyed reading his book."
3,jeff the fricking drunk,"first off i would like to say i wish amazon had half stars cause this cd isn't quite 4 stars but not 3 with this said here is my review .i think jeff sings real good and be giving the proper admiration that he deserves .the main problem with the cd is that they don't include his f-up's instead they have skits with the outtakes which in my opinion hurt's the cd.good thing is the cd is very inexpensive ,so if you want a real good party starter cd and you have a budget of 4 dollars jeff the drunk is perfect for you!let's hope yucko the clown don't put a cd out next!"
1,Twelve bucks... really?!,"Like J. Sweet, I also came across this at a dollar store a while back. Thought I could get a laugh out of it and it was only a buck. ...Wow, was it not even worth a buck. I wasted a few minutes of my time on this swill, don't make the same mistake. I really don't mind it being offensive, I have that type of humor. But this is just simply so stupid that I really can't understand how it was made, marketed, and sold to anybody, really. But if you feel you need this, check out your dollar store first, or buy the cheapest copy you can find."
1,Bits burn out far too quickly,"I've done maybe four or five light sessions with this iron, maybe 8 to 10 hours total.I've already changed the bit once, and looks like I'll need another one soon.I used to work in the trade, I had my iron on all day, and I expected a 25 or 30 watt iron to need its bit changed maybe every few months.I know it is called a Home Project Iron, but that's exactly what I'm using it for. I bought Weller expecting better quality than this.Oh yes, I've just searched Amazon, and the Internet, and the bits (where available) plus shipping are nearly as dear as the iron. On major distributor says, for all bit shapes for this iron, ""1/8"" Screwdriver Marksman Replacement Tip for SP23 and SP23D Iron - We No Longer Offer This Product - no replacement"" so I guess I'll be throwing this P.O.S. away.If you want to do a couple of very small jobs, it'll do, but I expected better."
4,"Lightweight tool, not for big jobs.","This is a standard Weller soldering iron (and can be used as such) with an exacto-style knife blade holder. The iron itself is 25 watts. For small jobs, such as sealing and thin plastic cutting, this tool is fine. Don't expect to use it for anything thick without some difficulty."
5,This Book Forever Changed My Life,"In my 20's I was self-centered, insecure, paranoid, sad, depressed, and suicidal. I first read Opening to Channel by Sanaya Roman and Duane Packer which then led me to other books by these authors. And thank goodness it did! Living With Joy helped me change my perspective of my life. It helps the reader examine why his/her life is the way it is and to recognize the beauty of its perfection. I'm now 32 years old and the happiest I can imagine ever being. Even when life throws new curves at me, I see things as challenges to help me become a stronger person. If you know anyone who is depressed or angry at the world, send them a copy of this book. It just may make a difference."
5,Wonderful Series of Books!!!,"I have read all of Sanya Romans books and have passeed them on to many friends! They are very thought provoking and in some cases, life changing! I highly recommend them!"
5,"Beautiful, Easy, Inspiring... a must read","I read this book over ten years ago and still flip it open to increase the level of bliss in my life. I recommend it to clients on a regular basis and will never tire of the delightful inspiration on these pages.

4,Clear yet not breathtaking,"This is a pretty good book with clear content, but I can not say it is something radically new or extremly innovative in approach. It tells you that active imagination is your doorway out of where you are and into joy, to acknowledge the simplest things, to be willing to take a risk and do what you love for living, to settle for nothing less than joy, that relationships will succeed to the degree to which a person can receive the other's love, that with thinking about how much love there is everywhere you will tap in to people with similar mindset, to appreciate everyone you see, to learn to say ""no"", that denying freedom to your loved one makes him a prisoner, while it makes you a jailer and takes your freedom away as well... There are also some playsheets with questions like: list three areas in which you allow yourself freedom, think of two people who have really made a difference in your life etc. If this is what you are looking for, go for it!"
5,Very insightful book; Simple to understand,"This book is wonderfully written! All one has to do is simply open the book and there is a message on every page. This book has been a tremendous help in my spiritual growth. If you only read one book on positivety, this is the one to read! I urge everyone to check it out."
1,Worst written and most confusing text book ever,"I find this book very confusing, I am a student starting my 2nd year of radiology and this is the first time this book has been used by my college, and hopefully in the future they will find a better book. One of my assignments for class is to define all the key terms at the beginning of each chapter, and they are a joke. Starting in chapter 3 there are 2 key terms Dose equivalent and Equivalent dose you look up the definition for dose equivalent and after reading and defining the term it says, dose equivalent is now called equivalent dose. I think this is very confusing. I have seen several things like this already in this book and have only made it to chapter 3, I will be crazy by the time I get through this book and feel for anyone else that has to use this book."
3,"Some Memorable, Some Not","There are some good songs in here, and the flagship song, For Longer Then Forever achieves what any great love song should. The score jumps around too much, and even as an avid fan of the movie, it doesn't stand alone very well as easy listening music. The other musical numbers, Isn't My Idea, No Fear, and Practice are all catchy and somewhat memorable, but Princesses on Parade and No More Mr. Nice Guy are easily forgettable."
2,Falls Short on Breed Descriptions,"When I purchased this book, I thought I would get a book that was going to give me a little information on general cat care and more on breeds and CFA's breed standards for cats. I was sadly mistaken. This book goes into a lot of detail in caring for a cat and only has a short section of colored pictures in the middle with the breeds of cat. This is not a book I would recommend to use if you're trying to learn the different breeds of CFA recognized cats."
3,toys never last,It was fine for a remote control car....my kid used it a few times got bored and now its lost somewhere. LOL But really toys come and go...never really last.
2,enjoy with adult supervision,"It was great fun for my 6 year old grandson the first time he crashed it. After that it ceased to work properly....he ws a bit heavy handed with it , no adult was around for the second crash try."
3,Crash car,"I really liked the idea of an RC car that can be wrecked and repaired. I got it for my little brother who seems to break everything, so I figured this would be ideal. upon opening the box I discovered the spoiler on the back was already broken and the screws for the batter tray were also missing. other than that it's pretty cool."
4,Can't be this simple?,"The authors make the impossible seem very possible in this excellent book. The differences between heroic and post-heroic leadership is well defined through stories involving real people. Can an organization switch from heroic to post-heroic leadership, sure, but it is not easy. Somehow this book and its ideas make that ideal a bit more reasonable. Only for managers and leaders who are ready to go out on a limb and turn everything they thought they knew upside down. Good luck."
1,worst book ever,contains almost no illustrations or examples. No answer key either. Worst math book ever.
1,Can I get a refund??,"That Shane Guy is ""DEAD ON"". No examples, No pictures, there is a reason this is the cheapest Real Analysis book around. ...Where is the list of errors for this book, because for every Y pages there are X many errors, s.t. X = alot."
2,Not truly compatible with Epson R260 printer,"The vendor (eforcity) was fine--shipped product promptly. The product, however, is not.I first just inserted the black cartridge, as that was the first that needed replacing. No problems and I was quite pleased with having saved so much money by buying a generic replacement. The problems started immediately after I replaced all the other cartridges. The color balance sometimes is correct, sometimes is not. Even though the cartridges still have plenty of ink, twice the printer has stopped working, displaying the message that I need to replace one (or more) of the cartridges. Now the black has started to print very erratically. A few print jobs had a splotch of black ink on the corner. Other print jobs have black print missing from the page. No matter how many times I do a nozzle clean, it doesn't seem to help.Next time I'm buying genuine Epson cartridges."
1,"Don't but it, it'll not work","I replaced the OEM inks with these ""compatible"" inks, the Epson R380 starts to act up and create color mess and complaining of the incompatible inks. I end up throw the sucker out."
1,Don't waste your money,"I have no qualms about the quality of ink. However, in my Canon MX870 they would almost always give me a ""non-compatible"" error and thus would not print. When I reseated them this ofttimes allowed them to work. But I quickly got tired of doing this.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Epson R260 costs too high,"I received an Epson R260 printer in a promotion for free. It uses the cartrides list here. No wonder they give them away free. This thing sucks more ink than a race car sucks gas. Genuine replacement cartridges are expensive for the time they last. I'll keep using my old reliable HP 952C printer. Cartrides for it are expensive but outlast the Epson by three or four times. My father-in-law also had an Epson a couple of years ago. Same story, he went back to using his HP printer even though pictures weren't as good. The cost of using an Epson is just too high."
5,Great tape.,"Just make sure you get this tape exactly where you want it, because once you wrap it, it will not come off. You have to cut it off. Its no joke. Some serious tape.A great product."
3,Solid meat-and-potatoes British rockabilly,"The Batz are a bit like the Stray Cats ... in fact there is a decent live cover of ""Rock This Town"" near the end of the disc. As a rule, the guitar work is not as strong as Setzer, but the riffs are pretty sharp and the singer of the Batz is better. My only complaint with this album is the first half of the disc -- the songs sound too alike, and the guitar is too ""clean"" in the mix. However, in the second half of the disc the production adds a nice edgy, reverb laden sound, such as in ""Streetwise"" and ""Electra Glide in Blue."" If you are looking for other obscure psychobilly bands, check out The Road Kings self-titled album (the one with the cards on front) -- it's absolutely brilliant."

3,great looks car seat cover,The car seat covers are great looking and give the interior a cool look but it has only been two months and all the sewing is coming apart!
2,Not a Good Introduction - Search for something else.,"If you are looking for a book to introduce you to XML, this is not the one. This book is basically a bunch of papers and articles slammed together and sold as a book. It doesn't have any continuity or proper flow. Every paper tries to introduce XML in a different way, which leaves the reader confused and disappointed. I will be looking for another book."
1,Hate It!,"I registered for this toy w/out having seen in ""in person"" b/c it sounded cute. BIG mistake! Unfortunately, my 1-year-old daughter received this as a birthday gift.This toy is flimsy and horrible. The pieces that are supposed to make him ""wobble"" don't stay on his ""hands"" like they should and the only thing wobbly about it is how poorly and cheaply it's made.Don't waste your money!"
2,Where is the real world?,"Not the quality I would expect in a textbook titled ""Quality"".It is obvious that many of the problems are pulled out of the air and not put together by subject matter experts, e.g. one on bicycles on campus, locking them up, and security. If you ride a high-end bike you will get a good laugh out of this example. This may be OK for the naive 20 year old but not the have lived around the world, work at 15 different jobs 60 year old grad student.Formulas are put out as ""Ok folks, here's the formula, use it."" with no proof (this would be a good place for the appendices), just doesn't cut it when you have a degree in mathematics and have had to prove all formulas.Many missed references to the wrong table in the appendices.Lots of tables & charts are repeated doing nothing but making the book larger. Another great place for appendicies.Glad I had the internet to really know what the issue in quality are."
2,"Detailed, yet not well organized","This book is not written very well (its 47.2 oz weight is a testamount to that: 47.2 oz on one topic?) Book has plenty of rounding errors and is not organized very well. Some topics are not explained well, and at 47.2 oz, a lot of weight is moved in pages to figure things out. I don't recomend this book. Find a shorter one."
4,Thunder on the right,"A wonderful polemic debunking some of the fashionable witterings that pass for serious thought in parts of academia. It could be cut by a third and it overlooks some serious problems in science, but it is a stirring defence of scientific method against the woolly irrationalism of some social philosophers. Great fun to read."
2,A sad little book on a sad little topic,"This COULD have been an intereting discussion of some of the serious in-roads that ""postmodernist discourse"" has had on the teaching of science in the United States. Unfortunately the authors seem to have selected the most egregious examples of sheer silliness, and then to have adopted the shrill sneering tones of their worst enemies in order to articulate their critique. While I am anything but a post-modernist it saddens me no end to see the debate reduced to this level. Better to ignore a bad argument altogether than to adopt the tactics of one's foes."
1,pedantic,"I read this book because I am interested in the topic, but after awhile, I wasn't even sure what the topic of this book was. As a mathematician, I am used to reading scholarly technical papers but I could hardly follow this. I would recommend Carl Sagan's book, 'Science as a Candel in the Dark' to anyone who has trouble reading this book."
3,Onward Union soldiers...,"For the teeny bopper contingent that seems to make up the large bulk at Ani's concerts, this may not be the album for you. But on second thought, maybe you should buy this album, you may learn a thing or two. Ani once again is taking a departure from her well known grrrl rock melodies and trading it in for a funkier beat to accompany the legendary Utah Phillips on a history course that we wish they had in school. For the die hard Ani fans, it isn't ""Dilate"", but it's worth a listen."
4,Phat CD!!,"First of all, I must say that Ani DiFranco is my reason for living on this earth. She is my inspiration, and my everything. I also owe the previous recording she did with Utah Phillips called""The Past Didn't Go Anywhere,"" and this new one far surpasses the last. There's a l ot of talk about socialism, the rights of the people, and little known historical injustice. Check it out, you won't be disappointed!!"
1,"Big fan, but this CD sucks","I'm a big fan of Utah Philips, and a fan of Ani DiFranco, and I love their initial collaboration ""The Past Didn't go Anywhere"", but this CD sucks. Utah sounds tired, and the joke aren't funny, the music is weak, and Ani is just a back up singer."
1,Too much talk; not enough singing,"I bought an Ani DiFranco album ""Fellow Workers"" because a girl in a music chat room told me she was the greatest.I thought this album was the worst album I have ever heard. Much too much talk and hardly any singing. The background music was presentable. I don't think I ever heard Ani.I was not impressed with this album and would not want another by Ani DiFranco."
1,the third dissapointment in a row from Ani,"Is this guy the ONLY political folkie she could find out there? After the mediocre Little Plastic Castle and Up Up Up etc., I started to get the feeling that a new recording per year was stretching her abilities a little thin. Now I'm sure of it. This is an awful CD that doesn't hold a candle to their first effort, and even that one wasn't great. Why can't more young people be like this? Because we like GOOD music, grandpa!"
2,not what i expected!!!!!,"i bought this cd because i like ani, not because i like utah phillips (whoever the hell he is.) im not saying that this cd is awful, i am saying that i expected to hear more from ani in it. all ani sings in it is in the background in like 2 songs."
2,A Slag-Fest of Words,"After reading Rowling's Harry Potter and Chabon's Cavalier and Clay, I eagerly awaited Summerland. Boy, was I disappointed. This overlong, show-offy and tension-free barge of a book was just, plain dull. Wanting to write a children's book and actually doing it well are two vastly different things.This is the literary equivalent of Bill Buckner's play at first base in the sixth game of the '86 World Series. I hope Chabon learns from his error and goes back to writing for adults, which he does fabulously well."
3,Tad too long IMHO,"Ethan Feld and his motley crew of friends have to stop Ol' Coyote from ending the world. A lot of baseball (too much for me), mythology (mostly fae-related), and a bit-too-lengthy tale overall; I felt it could have been shortened a bit and been a stronger story. I lost interest a few times. I did like many of the support characters, who I felt had more heart and oomph than the main (namely Jennifer T., Cutbelly, and to a degree Thor Wignutt) character Ethan - who starts off rather whiny. As this book is technically a young adult fantasy, perhaps this is why it didn't jibe with me completely. Still, a decent enough story - I always enjoy apocalypses and myth and there is that here."
2,Not quite good.,"The book feels mixed. By this, I mean that the diction often times feels too high for kids, and at other times dialogue and events feel like too much of a cliche for adults. Personally though, I felt like this book overall was a throw away project. The plot, world, and concept all felt as though they were cobbled together from other well know fantasy novels, a little bit of Gaiman, a dash of Tolkein kind of feel. Furthermore, I often felt as if the author didn't trust the reader to quite get the various reference in the book, which would have been to the books benefit, so he instead forced the references down the readers throat killing any fun out of those that understood it right from the beginning. I must, however, give credit for the use of baseball which was unique and interesting, but even this wasn't enough for me to say this book was good."
4,Summerland,"I loved this book. It's great for anyone who wants to hear about life and baseball.this book is a fun and exciting story that you can't put down until you finish it.Summerland gets more exciting as you go.The characters in this book are Ethan Feld, Mr.Feld, and jennifer T. The book follows all these characters through the summer as they play baseball and venture through life. Also this book has mystery as Ethen meets a mistereous man on the other side of the fenceat the ball field.This book excite you and get you reading even if you don't like too. Summerland was one of the best book I've ever read.You've got to go and find this book you will absolutly love it ."
4,The magic of baseball,"Ethan Felds is the worst player on his baseball team, and everyone knows it. In spite of this, he finds himself drawn into a struggle to save the universe, travelling in an alternate universe where all stories are true, and baseball is a metaphor for life. Together with a rag-tag team of misfits, he must find his way along the branches of this other world to the well that feeds the tree of the universe, to save his father and prevent the poisoning of the tree that supports the universe.This is a wonderfully quirky tale about an awkward boy who discovers that he is stronger than he would have believed, and about the importance of stories in giving meaning to life. The true magic is the power of stories to fuel our imaginations, and fill us with wonder. Just remember, keep your eyes open!"
4,fantasy but not FANTASY,"To me, this book was a clever mix of fantasy with reality. Even though it is clearly a work of fantasy, there is an underlying current of reality that separates from a bit from the usual fantasy genre. This is coming from a lover of pure fantasy books. I definitely enjoyed this book and believe it would be appreciated by lovers of fantasy and adventurous, imaginative fiction alike."
5,Exceptional Book,"Summerland by Michael Chabon was a very good book. It had great elements of fantasy and reality coming together. Also there is a moving part in the book with Ethan feelings about his mother who had dies before the book begins. Chabon has an amazing feel for all the fantasy that goes on in the book. If these types of characters were real (like giants, ferishers and everyone else) Chabon would be describing them perfectly. The great thing about Summerland is that the elements of reality are perfect. With baseball season and Ethan's friends tie in with the fantasy part. Having the tough, but smart Jennifer T. and brainniac Thor it helps the flow of the book. It is a great story and a shocking outcome that I won't reveal. Hope you enjoy it."
3,Baseball meets fantasy,"I've never read any books by Michael Chabon and happened onto this one at a bookstore. The cover intrigued me to pick it up and read what the book was about. I love fantasy and tend to read more young adult fantasy than adult. The book dragged a bit and had me ho humming until ""Second Base""...page 153. From that point on...the book picked up immensely and held me in rapt attention til the end."
5,Much better than Harry Potter,"This is the best children's book I have read in a long time. I am an adult but I think this book fits best in ""read it to you child at bedtime"" book category. It would be fantastic. It is as some others said baseball, the quest and American middle earth all wrapped up in one. I couldn't put this book down after starting it and I bet you will not be able to either. If you like Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Baseball, Narnia, etc. then you will love this book."
5,For Young and Old,"This is a fun read. Chabon is a true literary talent, and in Summerland he sets aside the complicated, down-to-earth troubles of humans and their relationships for a charming world of fantasy. It's fun, it's easy, it's well written, and little Elroy will ask you to read another chapter before bedtime, every night, until it's done."
5,For All Ages,"Many readers are comparing this to Harry Potter, but it's really an American ""His Dark Materials"". (If you haven't read the Phillip Pullman series, do yourself a favor and buy them!) I'm 32 and not a baseball fan, but I read this in the space of a weekend. Great characters and high adventures."
2,It's OK to stop in the middle of this one!,"I turned to these customer reviews in the middle (well, the first quarter, to be honest) just to make sure I wasn't totally missing something. This is such a disappointment! I really enjoyed Chabon's Kavalier & Klay, but even that took forever to plod through because of his unfortunate need to populate his worlds with almost excruciating detail. But in Summerland, I just find this over-detailing just makes the whole thing grind to a halt. I read, and enjoy, books for younger readers, too, so I wasn't turned off by that. I'm a baseball nut, too, especially the philosophy of the game and its history, but even all these tantalizing details don't bring this story to life. There are many moments when the writing itself is wonderful, but if this book hadn't been written by Chabon, I don't think it would have raised a buzz at all."
2,Being juvenile doesn't mean its good for kids,"I don't understand what makes Mr. Chabon think that he is qualified to write for kids. Is it the fantasy element? All kids should read fantasy now? The sentence structure in this book is not at all appropriate for the supposed age range, and a lot of the themes, while light, are not really aimed at kids per se. Still, its content is not really objectionable. As a teacher, I do not like to see writers jumping on the Harry Potter bandwagon just because they can."
1,Summer-dud by Michael Chabon,"I usually don't write reviews, but after reading Summerland by Michael Chabon, I have to let one go. This is probably one of the worst books I have ever read. And I've read alot of 'em. This Harry Potter wanna' be reads more like a cross between a poorly written Steven King and a Douglas Adams novel that doesn't make any sense at all. Although, the plot is quite simple, Chabon complicates our journey through Summerland by confusing us with character, objects and places that are given names so complicated, or the reverse, so simplistic, that they become ridiculous and confusing. As Chabon got caught up more and more into the creation of this ridiculously confusing world the reader becomes less and less interested in finishing the novel. I forced myself to finish it, just to see if it got any better; it didn't!"
2,eh...,"I just might not be a Chabon-type reader, but I thought the book was pretty boring. And I usually finish what I start. I stopped reading this around the middle. Maybe I just didn't like reading about an 11 year old boy trying to stop armaggedon. It just wasn't my type of fantasy, that's all. You can read it (or start reading it) for yourself and see how you like it."
2,SO BAD!!!,"Summerland was probably the worst book that I have read in a LONG time. It's confusing, the story is TERRIBLE, and the characters change all the time. Don't waste your time reading this awful book. You'll regret it!"
3,Good--but a little peculiar,"well-written, but too wierd topics and ather stuff like that-- set in WA, though!"
1,Good Author Gone Bad,"As the other reviewers mention, this book is over written. Perhaps there is a marvelous story that Chabon is trying to tell us in Summerland, but I was hard pressed to find it. Telling the tale of a mystical island in the Northwest, this book fails to integrate a sports story, fantasy/tall tale of the Holes variety, with that of a family drama. There is superior work in each genre and the interested young reader should turn their attention to the superior and more accessible books found with-in those genres. The ambitious young adult reader should read Chabon's adult literature, much of which is truly excellent."
1,"Stereotyped, out of context, and simplified...","Chabon's portrayal of Native American ""little people"" truly defies belief. First, he took legends from at least ten sources and mixed them up. Then he simplifies them and gives them downright stereotyped roles.This is one of the most disturbing pieces of European colonialism of Native American ideas that I have read in years. If you liked this book, but wanted portrayals of Native American ""fairies"" that resemble realistic, I highly suggest you read the books of Canadian author Charles de Lint. While most of his stories are meant for adults, many of his short stories are understandable to children if you wish to spend a little time explaining these things to them, and several of his published books are collections of short stories."
3,Delightful and Disappointing,"This book is a little frustrating. It has all the right pieces to be a fine book, for kids and adults. Baseball. Mythology. American legends like Paul Bunyan and John Henry. A battle between the forces of good and the forces of evil.But despite all of these, or maybe because of these, subjects and characters and plot devices, the book is a little bit hollow. Chabon sounds too many notes. The characters are charming, but not touching, if that makes any sense. I kept wanting to dive into the imaginative space of Summerland. At the same time, the confusion of all the bric-a-brac allusions to Norse mythology, then Native American mythology, then American Legend, graft upon graft, kept my feet planted firmly on the edge of the pool.An okay read for a lazy summer's day, but one that probably won't be read again.-"
4,Wow! Chabon shows his range,"This was a wonderful work of Fantasy Fiction. A 21st century Wizard of Oz or Lord of the Rings. It was a gutsy move for Chabon to follow-up his Pulitzer Prize winning ""Adventures of Kavalier & Clay"" with a book geared towards kids. In my opinion that move has paid off. I will make sure that all three of my children read this one in their pre-teen years."
4,American Potter,"The tremendous, phenomenal, record-smashing success of the Harry Potter series has brought both publishers and authors to recognize the viability of novels that appeal to both young people and the older but still young at heart. Thus, Michael Chabon, Carl Hiassen, Neil Gaiman, and even Clive Barker (!) have new young/old adult novels to woo or wow the public. ""Summerland"" has charateristics similar to the famous Mssr. Potter, and especially C.S. Lewis' beloved Chronicles of Narnia series. If you are a fan of either (and who isn't?), you'll want to check out ""Summerland."" You don't have to be a fan of baseball, although it might help; the book is nominally about a magic world where baseball rules. You do, however, need to possess a love of magic, innocence, discovery, and wonderment. Skeptics and humbugs need not apply."
4,Fantasy adventure AND baseball? Now you're talking!,"I thought the book was wonderful. It was certainly a change of pace for Michael Chabon, and while I wouldn't say it rates up there with Tolkein or C.S. Lewis, it was a fantasy adventure that certainly rates higher than the Potter novels (which I really enjoyed!) There is one potential problem with the book. My 10 year old son read the book and liked it, but after hearing me read chapters aloud to my 7 year old son before bed, he said that he thought he missed a lot of detail. ""Too many characters for a kid to keep track of"", he was his comment. But, he had the same comment reading Tolkein, so it's no indictment of the book, obviously. Maybe the best bet is to read it to your kids, or discuss the book with your kid as he reads it. The beauty of the book is in the richness of the folklore and the development of the characters, so it is worth discussion. I highly recommend this book."
2,a long road to nowhere,"I feel dumb. I didn't know it was a book for kids. I read Summerland and kept waiting for it to get better. It never really did. Contrived, laborious, a time waster that I should have quit -- as my friend did after 30 pages -- but read to the bitter end. I read the Mysteries of Pittsburgh a few years back and enjoyed it, and picked up this book after hearing glowing reviews of The Wonderboys. And I enjoyed that ""little"" movie they made of Wonderboys. And while the actual language of Summerland was at times beautiful, for 500 pages it was too long and an average story. I'm a lover of baseball, and even that seemed contrived. I feel dumb because I don't get that much reading time, and I feel I wasted valuable hours on this."
5,SUMMERLAND,"I'm almost through reading this wonderful novel to my 9 year old. He cannot get enough and neither can I of this wonderful mix of fantasy, adventure and folklore. Narnia, Middle Earth, Hogworts and Wind In the willows all mixed together.Michael Chabon has written a classic. Looking forward to discovering his other works."
2,Summer-Bore,"I began this book with such high hopes since I had so thoroughly enjoy Kavalier & Clay. In the end, I was just bored with the book. There were too many characters to keep track of and I felt that what was told in 500 pages could have been told even better in half that space."
2,Disappointing coming from Mr. Chabon,"Michael Chabon is my favorite author, and The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay is my favorite novel, so I tackled Summerland with much anticipation. Unfortunately, it does not live up to Chabon's previous works. The novel is horribly paced and the American mythologies, the use of which which others have lauded, were integrated poorly. Save on rare occassions, Summerland fails to grasp the magic of such children's novels as The Wizard of Oz and Harry Potter. As an adult novel, it is a near-complete failure. I can't help but think that this novel was written before any of Chabon's previously published work and could be published only now that its author is famous. Still this book was somewhat enjoyable, although I would only reccomend it to a Chabon completist."
4,Self Titled,"This is quite a good CD despite some of the other reviews.It starts of with the radio edit and then starts The Lmc Extended Vocal Mix is probably my least favourite. The synthesiser sounds like it is talking (: ""bodies like, bodies like, bodies like etc.) which can gat annoying as it repeats throughout the song. The Original Extended Vocal Mix is quite good, it is very similar to track two, though it is not as remixed in the vocal parts. The Flower Power Club Mix proves that this song doesn't need vocals to be good! It is one of my favourites and the absolute original. The final track is entitled the Afterlife Lounge Mix which is my definate favourite it is very chillout and it a different style to all of the above: It is not as danceable.This CD peaked at #20 in Australia and #7 in UK, and #2 in Scotland - and it is quite a good CD. I got what I expected.79%"
4,Gift for a Senior Citizen,"What do you get for a father-in-law who is 90 years old. Not much in the way of items other then food, and how much can you eat when it is a one person household. Well, I visited an assisted living facility, and in their craft room they had puzzles set up that anyone could help put together. So I got the idea of getting him just that for Christmas. I even liked it so much I asked Santa for one myself. It can be left and you can come back to it as many or as few times as you want. And you are learning at the same time. Great idea!"
4,Funny but impressive,"This play is humorous but quite an impressive piece at the same time. There are some lovely bits in it, and if it is staged correctly, you're sure to get a lot of laughs by the end of the night. Einstein and Jonathan can really carry the show if they're cast well for each other, and Elaine adds a young face to the ensamble. A wonderful production."
2,Poor quality binding and print,"While the play is very good and this edition list all the blocking, set design, and props, the quality of the page copy is poor and the binding is flimsy and falls apart after a month of rehearsals. That said, it is the exact same product as you get from Dramatists and with shipping and multi copy discounts, the price here is much better."
1,Worst binding ever!,"I have been directing for 15 years and this is the first script I have ever had that has literally fallen apart within the first two weeks of rehearsal. The glue on the bindings is not holding, so the actors are losing pages. Very frustrating for a script that I paid top price for in the first place. I will not order from Amazon for scripts again. If I could rate it a zero, I would!"
4,Really Great!,"What fun! Not laughter - better than that: sincere enjoyment. Crazy story that read as a real, misfortunate series of absurd events. Excellent construction."
4,An excellent edition of a time-honored translation,The King James Version Bible is one of the oldest books still available in print. This a a time-honored translation of God's word that has helped many learn His truth. I would advise anyone to own and read the KJV. It is simply the most elegant translation of God's word that has ever been done.There are many who see the KJV as the only true version of God's word. I am not one of those people. I prefer other translations for study though I do occasionally enjoy reading from the KJV.This edition is one of the best in my opinion for one simple reason. The publishers have printed the original KJV preface in this newest edition. This is the first time that has been done in quite a while. Learn what the KJV translators had to say about their own work. It's very informative in light of what the KJV-only proponents would have us believe.Read it for yourself and see.
5,excellent!,"Price is great. The type is very readable and bold. Study helps in the back (miracles, parables, Jesus' ministry in chronological order etc) and reading plan in the front are very helpful. But what really makes me ADORE this version is the KJ translators noted in by the references. There are many (45,000?) cross references in this Bible, and in the center column with them are the translator notes. It is rare to find this in KJ Bibles these days. Think NASB translator notes but with the expertise of these men shedding light on the Hebrew/Greek giving us even more of the nuance of the words.I buy these to give out, and bought one for myself to get rebound for much use. Wish I had known about this years ago. For once, kuddo's to Zondervan for this one!"
4,"Good, but pages are hard to turn at first","I had a Bible similar to this one and really liked it. The center column reference is very helpful. The concordance in the back could be more in depth, but is still a good reference.My only negative comment on it is that the pages are hard to turn. They like to stick together. But, all in all, it has been a good replacement for the one I had"
2,It was not what I asked for,I wanted genuine leather and this was not that it is just paper bound that looks like leather. The description was not true.
3,Nice book,It's an okay book. Not a spell binding...gee I just can't put down book. But is is worth reading and I would recommend it.
2,Meh,"Quick read. Light and airy. The author made an early attempt to keep the main plot from losing credibility, but then through it out the window. Probably in an effort to keep the book under 500 pages."
1,NOT WELL WRITTEN.,"For only the second time in 40 years, I could not finish this book. I found it very choppy - it did not flow at all. Sorry, but I cannot recommend."
1,Must have read something else....,"I bought this book because it had good reviews and was free, however it was my time rather than my money that was wasted. I felt like the main character, Cooper, was an irritating teenager at best, while our hero, Alec, was brash and uninteresting, not to mention, a terrible cop. The story was utterly ridiculous with Cooper walking around with a magnet on her head, using her ESP, and Alec trying to get away from the crazy woman. I imagine at some point, after Cooper gets crazy drunk from alcohol and pain pills and annoys everyone, that she and Alec get together to solve some crime. I rarely write a review when I haven't finished a book because you never know if the author was able to pull it out, but with this one, I can't imagine it getting any better."
2,Uncommon Sense,A bit of a silly story. It started off ok but after the first couple of chapters it went downhill pretty fast.
4,It's 'OK',"A somewhat far-fetched basic premise, but once you (sort of) accept that.....A reasonably interesting tale - with an extended cast of characters, some of whom just seem to be included to fill out the book. Keeps you interested and turning pages....."
3,Different,DifferentThis was more of a love story. I was looking for a bit more suspense. I didn't find this at all scary
4,Review of Arizona Wildlife,Quick and easy guide to Arizona wildlife. Easy to travel with and doesn't get dirty or messed up when traveling. Very helpful.
3,Ummm...,...you have to be pretty drunk or stoned to enjoy these films. I wanted to see them just because I'm a King Kong fan and wasn't expecting Great Art. Set your sights -very low- if you plan to watch these in their entirety. Queen Kong at least fights a few rubbery dinosaurs...Kong Island is an ape-suit-in-a-cage film.
5,"P&P with a twist, and one of my favorite takes","This book is one of my very favorite of the horde of various takes on Austen books. The plot follows Pride and Prejudice, except that the genders are reversed, and the setting is modern town in Yorkshire, where a movie crew arrives to film Pride and Prejudice. Instead of Lizzy and Jane we have Nick Bevan, a journalist-turned-writer, and his brother in law John; instead of Darcy and Bingley we have Mary Hamilton, the director, and Candia, her star actress. The book is beautifully written-- I absolutely love the author's way with language. My only nitpick is that after the revelation in the middle, the plot STILL follows P&P although we are now supposedly transported to Nick's ""real"" world, which rings false. Also, having them film P&P draws too much attention to the original this book is taking on. Other than that, though, I love it, and it's always tons of fun to read."
3,a Welsh twist to an old story,"Ms. Fenton's modern adaptation of P&P takes more than a few chapters to get into it, but once you do, the fun comes quickly. The lilt of the language took more concentrating than I anticipated for a novel I was reading in bed before retiring. The switch back and forth of the names (Mary Dance vs. Mary Hamilton and Nick Bevan vs. Llewellyn Bevan) threw me off for a couple of chapters. I must learn to read more closely even if it is late at night!!! Yet, the switch of Mary Dance being the tall, dark hero rather than ""Mr. Darcy"" was ingenuous. The fact that the film crew over which Mary is in charge is filming Pride and Prejudice gives this a nice twist. Having Sarah be equivalent to ""Mr. Bennet"" was not achieved until the final chapters, but, generally, you will enjoy the book. I could do without the ""F"" word in the love scenes, but that is a personal preference. I would not turn down reading the book purely on that note."
4,"Fun, sweet novel","What a fun, sweet story with a modern and gender-bending twist. I loved the characters and was sad to see the book end. Very enjoyable-but don't expect P&P!"
2,Vexed by the vanity of the author,"Pride and Prejudice is my favorite book, and has been through many re-readings since I first experienced it in 1977. I've read many books based on the story, some good, and some bad. This author just doesn't pull it off. I didn't care about the characters. I wanted to like them, but couldn't. When I found out almost half way through that I was reading a novel within the novel, it was a blow to the way I viewed the characters. It was a twist I didn't need. Character and story development would have been a far better tactic in writing this novel. I mention story development, because none of the nuance one finds in Jane Austen was present in this book. The author did invert the genders of the characters, and that could have been interesting if she could have pulled it off. Vanity and Vexation is light, fluffy, and not good enough to recommend."
3,A Story of Our Time,"I felt the title a bit misleading ""A novel of Pride and Prejudice"". It was creative, unique, different, modern but it definitely wasn't what I would expect from a story related to P&P. So if you are more into Bridget Jones Diary lets say you might enjoy this. If you are turned off by cursing etc. then either don't read it or check it out from the library."
2,"Read ""Pride and Prejudice"" Instead","While Kate Fenton has written a little after dinner mint of a book, she is no Jane Austen. She is not even Austen Powers, for that matter. Drawing her plot from the gentle, delightful comedy ""Pride and Prejudice,"" Fenton tries, in vain, to reset the book in modern-day Yorkshire. She has taken on a task beyond her skills, and should not be congratulated for trying. Her dialog is pungent, and often funny, but her grasp, overall, exceeds her reach...Read Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"" instead and avoid both vexation and this author's vanity."
2,Better read it yourself,"I have read the book ""Just Say No"" and I liked it, I also brought the Audio book, however I did not like the reading of the book as well as I liked reading it. Perhaps if it would have been read by someone other than the Author I would have liked it; I found Omar's reading to hyped and gave you no time to really enjoy the flow of what was going on. In my opinion he made the people in the book sound to over acted. He read the book like he was talking to someone...and the singing, well let's just say I'm glad he a writer. If he should ever want to put one of his books on Audio again....please get someone else to read it for you."
2,Unintentionally funny,"I finished reading this book about a week ago. The book started out okay, but the further I got into the story the more unreal it became. I was not convinced that John ""Loverboy"" Williams was as talented as the book let on. The book had a lot of potential, but the song lyrics and music beats ruined the book by making it more of a comedy than a serious work of fiction. The ""telling"" of the story rather than the use of description made the story totally ineffective. The ending, rather than leaving me in tears, left me laughing for the past week. I do not believe that was the intention."
4,"review of ""just say no""","If you read all of omar tyree books in order, as I have. You will understand how omar tyree the writer has come to be. I thought tyree had lost his touch. ""single mom"" and ""sweet st. louis"" were very slow reads. when tyree picked up the pace with ""for the love of money"", i knew tryee ""flyy girl"" tyree was back to stay. And tyree has proven me correct. although a long book a good read ""just say no"" tells what it's like behind the scenes. It's a reality check of celebrity life of a beautiful singer. perhaps ""Loverboy"" was a little before his time.........."
2,Ineresting..........BUT,"I thought that Omar Tyree's new book, ""Just Say No"" would be intriging..I have read 2 previous efforts, ""Single Mom"" and ""Fly GIrl"" and was impressed. Reading the first couple of chapter tells the story of two friends, Darin (""D"") Harmin and Jhon Williams, who rise as a manager/singer twosome. Also a third friends, Tony Williams joins Jhon as his drummer. Everything seems to go right until Jhon starts using drugs and egts WAY out of hand, with everything from groupies, sex, drugs, money and EVEN personal unsolved conflicts between his mother,and a ROLE in the death of his bodyguard/best friend Big Joe. I felt the book was so boring from Darin's point of view.He literally would have walked the same path as John if he wouldnt have been strong. The book would has been a little interesting if told from the point of view from Tony Williams."
1,One Word= YAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWNNNNNN!!!,"i strongly erge omar to stop writing books all together because just say no was a waste of my time. i thought that he could redeem himself from the drasticly boring book for the love of money, but i see that he just dug himslef into an even deeper hole. thank God for libraries though, because i never would have never even thought about reading this crap if a didn't own a library card. you know the saying: only write about what you know? well omar needs to take that quote into close consideration, because he knows doggone well that he knows nothing about all the fame that he writes about, which is also why for the love of money was a waste of my time and money (but let's not even get started on that book Lawd forbid!). after i read this book I had one question in my head: ""now just how many trees did omar have to kill to actually get this ... printed?"" the answer is still unknown. LOL"
1,Just Say No to Buying this Book...,"Again, I can't believe that people over the age of ten years old actually read Omar Tyree books. The book Just Say No, and the accompanying CD which features Tyree ""singing"" are just plain embarassing. I agree with the other reviewer that said the characters were predictable, including John ""Loverboy"" Williams. It's like Tyree has a formula that he must use for all of his books. I don't recommend this book, and I sometimes wonder if the positive reviews for his books are written by Tyree under different names, or by blind people without access to Braille. Pick up a serious piece of African American fiction instead of this tripe. Oh, and if you don't believe me, read this sentence. It begins the book and almost made me stop reading right there. Notice the abundance of prepositions.""I stopped daydreaming about the past and looked out of my cab window at a mental hospital of red brick and gray cement that was out in the middle of nowhere within the state of Maryland."""
3,JUST SAY YES AND NO!,"I began reading Omar Tyree's JUST SAY NO! this Septemberwhen I was beginning school.It started out decent but one thingI noticed was that if you read one Omar Tyree novel,you've read 'em all.It seems like my man Omar recycles elements from hisother novels.I did enjoy this book thought and reading thisnovel let me see how the music business REALLY is.Judging howgood Do Right Man was,I was excpecting a better book,but overallthought,JUST SAY YES,bookworms! PS to O.T.:No more retarted song lyrics OK!"
2,What In The World!!!,"What in the world was Omar thinking? This was the worst book I read in a long time. It took me weeks to read, when it usually only take a me a couple days. I had no desire to pick it up and finish it. I was an Omar fan (key word was) until I read this. Did he have a deadline to meet or what? This story is hard to follow especally with the song lyrcs. Pleeeese Omar, I know you can do better than this. I think you have lost your touch. You might have a shot in the music buisness. Leave the novel writing to the pro's."
5,WOW!!,"This book was the BOMB!!! I am tempted to read it again. It shows the importance of a solid friendship, no mattter what. The book was funny, but real. John was an only child who was over protected by his very religious mother, then he met Darin, an average boy who wants to show him the ropes. Over the years they become best friends, eventually going off to college together. One day, John decides to sing in the Homecoming talent show, and after blowing the crowd on to their backs, especially the 'ladies', John jumps on the fast track to stardom. Darin being the good friend that he is, backs him 100%. Before you know it, you are being sucked into the fast and wild life of stardom, sex, drugs and money. Its amazing how someone so sweet and innocent and can be turned out so quickly and easily.There is only one problem, the beats and lyrics are hard to follow."
3,OK,"This book was a bit too slow for me. The story had a good message but the pace was a bit slow. I do understand a bit why it was so slow, for him to get to the point of the story he had to show you all the aspects for the conclusion. I wish it was edited a bit better, After all it made me cry in the end. It was not his best but it was a good book. Therefore it will stay on my shelf. Omar Tyree is a good writer. Everything will not be perfect at all times. Much love to Omar Tyree and his hard work. Ths book thought me alot about friendship, sacrifice and most of all love."
1,I wasted my time on this one,"After having read A Do Right Man and For the Love of Money, I was not impressed with Tyree's writing style (though I've managed to keep A Do Right Man on my bookshelf). The only reason I dared to read Just Say No was because it came highly recommended by a friend. While I did finish the book, I was thoroughly disappointed. The story moved incredibly slow and at times seemed to be going nowhere. The author doesn't trust his readers to 'connect the dots' of what he's trying to say, so he tends to explain every little thing. It gets annoying to say the least. The song lyrics and ""shoo-bee-doo-ooh-aahs"" were too much. I wondered if the story should've been a musical instead of a novel. I would not recommend this book to anyone unless they were interested in music and wanted to read a flat novel about two guys in the business."
1,How to sum up trash with three words,"Why is this man so popular? Why do people convince themselves that Omar Tyree can actually write? It's a little harsh to say he can't write at all when this is the only attempt I ever made at reading his work, but come on! I may not be a writer myself but I am a reader and I know trash when I see it. This book went absolutely nowhere. I only made it past the halfway point because my friend assured me it would be worth it to see how the story ended. The joke was on her because I got rid of the book and still found out the ending from a reliable source. Allow me to say I'm glad I didn't waste anymore of my time."
5,Ignore The Negative Reviews This Is Tyree's Best !,I was never really a fan of Omar Tyree until I read Just Say No! . Tyree paints an amazing picture of the music industry with this novel. I could really feel for the lead character Darren and the struggles he goes through as he sees his friend John go on a downward spiral. With the recent success of Dreamgirls here's hoping we see more black themed musicals in the near future. I could easily see Terrance Howard playing Darren and a singer like Usher playing Loverboy.
2,Just Say No to Reading This!,"What I thought started out to be a pretty good read, turned into pure torture after the first chapter as I struggled for more than three weeks to finish this book. For a person that usually finishes a book in a 24 hr. time frame, that's an eternity!! I suggest that next time you leave out writing lyrics and beats. Especially over and over. Most readers are more interested in the story. Thank God I read a copy from the library."
3,just say no is slow,"I have read just say no and I am truely dissappointed. This book unlike fly girl kept losing my attention. This book heats up at moments the slows down a bit too much with the decriptions of songs sang and music beats (totally not necessary). I fell in love with Omar Tyree after reading Flyy girl but he lost me alittle with for the love of money which underscored flyy girl a little too much and was slow as well. Omar take a break and create something with the excitement of Flyy girl and stop letting you home town fans down.Signed,Dissapointed in Philly but still a fan"
5,Great Story About Temptations That Come With Fame,"Great Book, reads well. Provided great insight into the music business and temptations that come with fame and success."
2,Yes i too wasted 25 dollars,"Omar tyree what happen to you. i'm not just referring to "" just say no"" and lord help me "" for the love of money"" but to every book after "" A do right man"" apparentyly some were along the line you have lost your creativity. Your books have become unrealistic. which would be fine if you were writing science fiction. not black contemporary. and almost unbearable to read. not saying that in all black books you have to struggle but your characters lack so much substance. books are not name brand clothing and it just seems that your pushing out ruff drafts and slapping you name on the cover expecting people to buy them. you know that you don't measure up to other authors but your books sold because of the sincerity and the matching of the times as battle zone and capital city did of cource flyygirl. i think maybe you need a break and go live a little before you write another book."
3,Sad ending,"I liked this work of Tyree's. It was way better than FOR THE LOVE OF MONEY, but cannot compete withFLYY girl. Mr. Tyree has allowed us to see into the world that many of our entertainers live in getting too much too fast. It was unbelievable that ""sweet"" John Williams turned into the person he did.Although the ending was sad, it was realistic and I like that Tyree had the guts not to sugar coat his book with an unrealistic ending. All in all JUST SAY NO is a good read."
3,Just Say No,"I liked the concept and the characters of Omar Tyree's latest book Just Say No. I thought Omar did a very effective job of setting up the rise and subsequent fall of musical genius John"" Loverboy"" Williams. The story was effctively narrated by John's childhood friend and business manager Darin Harmon. The crediability of the story benefitted by Omar's use of current day musical artist such as Jodeci, Mary J Blige and Allayh to name a few.The biggest problem I have with the book however, is the pacing of the storyline. There was way too much redundancy in regards to the sex and drugs sequences. I also felt Omar's inclusion of the musical notes and endless pages of song lyrics distracted from the story.Overall I rate the book a three star. It could have received a four if Omar had ""Just Said No"" to about fifty pages of redundant and distracting prose."
2,same old thing,The story is slick. You know what the characters will do before you turn the next page. Tyree never delves too deeply into why Loverboy Williams does the things that he does. The friendship between the two men is nicely done. For Tyree fans only.
1,Awful...,"That's it Omar! I can't do it anymore! I bought Fly Girl way back and liked it. But it has been downhill ever since. Your ego has grown so large that you can't stop referring to yourself in your books (what other author does that???) and the quality has become horrendous. For The Love of Money was just plain bad, and while Just Say No isn't as bad as that, it was just as predictable as the rest of your novels. I've got to ask: What the hell was the NAACP thinking when they gave you their award? Readers, if you want to read quality literature, check out Michael Datcher's Raising Fences. In fact, Omar, you should read it also, so that you can see how the craft of writing should be done."
2,Just say No,I was very disappointed in this book. The beginning was interesting but then it became way to predictable. Also Tyree is not a very savvy writer...his books are about 200 pages to long. He should try adn get the details in wiht out all the meaningless dialogue.
2,Nice try,Good concept but poor execution. The book had some interesting insights into the music business but was too long. Tyree's imitation of drum beats quite annoying and almost made me put the book down!
4,Just say... I cried.,I think I cried through the whole last chapter of this novel. I have read of number of Omar Tyree's novels and consider myself a fan of his work. But of all of those I have read so far none have affected me like this one. It really look like OT did his research for this book. He took you through the highs and lows of the music industry while taking your emotions throught the same. This story had a coming of age feel but it showed what happened when you took the wrong turn..... I enjoyed this book and highly recommend it.
3,Could have been better,"When I started this book, I didn't know what to expect.It is the first book that I have read by OT.As I read, I was surprised at how thorough OT was when it came to detail....a little too thorough.While the story gave an inside view of the entertainment world and music production, artist management,etc., it also depicted the ups and downs of the life that surrounds it.However, OT tends to overtell the story and give details that could have been left out.Nonetheless, it was a good read and was still well written. It even piqued my interest in reading more of Mr. Tyree's books.If you don't mind excessive detail, you will like this book."
3,Disappointed,"I was hoping that this book would be better than ""For the Love of Money."" I started reading this book hoping that at some point it would get better. I was sadly mistaken. I do hope that Omar's upcoming novel ""Leslie"" will redeem his writing skills. I can honestly say if it is as bad as his last 2 novels, I will never purchase another one of his books again and would encourage others not to."
5,granddaughter loves it,I gave this to my granddaughter for Christmas and she loves it. She'll sit for hours and play with it . I like that it's not so sticky
2,This book was not that great,"As I was reading this book it did't tell me that much about anything except that this did this and that did that. If I were you I would not buy this book. Although it is my opinion on the book, you might really like it."
2,Not that useful; Not as funny as he tries to be,I found the book to be only mildly useful and the author's attempts at humor rarely funny (mainly cliches re: organized crime). There are far better books for fresh insight to management - see Farson's Management of the Absurd.
4,Interesting maquiavelic vision of the world,"You can learn some things, others are totally crazy :) It totally worth it. I would recommend it to someone who is open enough to read something different and learn some stuff together with it."
1,Low-end,"I study leadership, politics in business organisations and emotional transactions. I bought this book thinking it would be factual, conclusive and real. On the other hand I found it's written with a mocking tone, has no relation to real cases and is as shallow as it gets.It could be good for some peasant who believes he can get ahead at work easily. But in reality, there's far more than this book wastes time about."
3,Entertaining guidelines not to follow outside the Mob,Using most of the clichés on how the mob is managed this entertaining little book gives practical advices on how these theories are applicable to business life. Or is the author using the mafia management practice as a metaphor to give a new perspective on how business management actually IS performed in many companies? Since most business managers can not wack out a disobedient employee that break the company rules the advices given are of limited value. However the book will give the reader a couple of joyful hours.
2,Hugh Kelsey,"Hugh Kelsey has written 10 excellent books mainly on playing techniques for the advanced bridge player. My favorite is ""the Tough Game"" published in 1979. Unfortunately ""Killing Defence At Bridge"" is a very cheaply done reprint of the 1966 classic, which has excellent content but is very difficult to read."
1,? Fluff,"A waist of money, I don't feel there is any ""meat"" of vodou in this book. Lots of fluff about how vodou has been mis-understood."
1,Fabrications,"Helllo! I am Mambo Racine Sans Bout, the same Mambo Racine about whom Ross Heaven has so many nice things to say in his book, ""Vodou Shaman"". It is with some regret that I must warn the prospective reader that most of what is in this book never actually happened - Ross is willing to say anything for a buck, apparently. He never let me see what he was writing until the book was published, and I never imagined he would make up so many stories! Now that I have refused to support his activities he is very angry with me, but the fact remains that this book is 99% BUNK. [...]"
5,great book,"This book is great for those readers who would like to know more about the real Vodou as opposed to the typical Hollywood movie style of Vodou, and especially for those who would have some interest in practical instructions in techniques and use of plants. For those whose knowledge of Vodou is solely consistent of the input from the media this book will be an eye opener. For those that are on the shamanic path of acquiring wisdom it will be a treasure."
2,vodoun,"The book is not bad, the exercises combining Western psychotherapy with some form of Haitian imagery are likely to be useful.This is a way of approaching African spirituality that takes away a lot of violent stuff - new Agey but not non-useful.The author is exploring, basically a voudun tourist."
4,Hot looking: need to break-in,"I purchased the zebra print and the skulls in this shoe. They run small so order 1/2 up. Additionally, the canvas is tight and was uncomfortable at first. I almost sent them back. However, they break-in pretty fast as they strech for your foot. The look of the shoe is great. I get a lot of compliments on them."
4,Good for Scotch lovers,"If you like a good single malt, or are considering drinking the ""water of life"", this magazine will please you - it has content for both the novice and ""expert"". The only reason it doesn't get 4 stars is it is a British publication, and many of the products reviewed or featured in articles are not available in the US. The area of distribution is given in the reviews, but this is not always mentioned in the articles."
4,Good Old Music,The music on this CD is beautiful and food for the soul. We could use more of the good old Christian songs that this country grew up on!
3,Takes me back in time,The songs on this CD have what the songs of today are lacking. True Meaning. Alan Jackson does a very good job singing them.
5,Timeless,Timeless classics. Old hymns done to perfection. What more can you say? My preacher owns a copy of this too...was gonna make him a copy but he had it...a Texas preacher...nuff said. Love this CD.
3,Like Alan Jackson's music,I was disappointed with this album and wish I had not purchased it.sounds are all too similar and I rarely listen to it.disappointing since i am an alan jackson fan.
2,Great voice doesn't always make a good album,"Before I begin, let me say that I enjoy Alan's music. Unfortunately, this album truly let me down. I have come to expect from Alan some of the best heart wrenching ballads and the fast get-up-and-dance songs as all the albums before this. This collection lacks both. If you enjoy the old time country sound with alot of religious overtones, then this is the album for you. Alan's voice and the way he plays his guitar are the only reason I gave this CD 2 stars!!I don't expect to see too many, if any, of these songs on top 40 radio anytime soon. Can't wait for the next album!!!!"
1,Not a typical AJ music,"I don't agree with someone who consider this album a good one. This is very different from the other AJ's album. I love AJ music but this isn't what a fan would hear from him. Reading the story about the concept of this album is clear that this is dedicated to his mother who like gospel music. I suggest for who wants to know AJ to listen to other album, except ""Let it be Christmas"". Waiting for a new work ..."
5,my kids love it!,I really wanted my children to learn the words to classic hymns so that they could sing them in church. They love it and I love it. The words are very clear and Alan Jackson has a wonderful voice that is easy for adults to listen to as well.
5,Spectacular,"Alan Jackson did a fine job with these hymns, as did the producer of the cd. I love that there's no overproduction. The hymns are presented simply with basic instrumentation, just the way I like them. This cd isn't merely pleasant background music, it really inspires one to focus on the Lord with an attitude of thankfulness for his mercy and grace. Highly recommended."
4,Memory Lane,"If you love Alan Jackson's voice and you grew up in a southern USA church in mid-twentieth century as I do/did, you will enjoythese ""goldie-oldie"" hymns and the memories they invoke. If you're younger than I, give this cd to your parents or grandparents. They'll love it!"
5,Awesome gift!,"Purchased for my Mom on Mother's Day. Absolutely great CD and she loved it! This is a keeper for any Christian, Alan Jackson, or gospel fan."
5,Best Sleeping Pill in the World,I go to sleep every night listening to this cd. I love the old time Gospel songs that I grew up with. This is a must buy for any Christian that loves Gospel.
5,AMAZING!,I love this CD! Normally I listen to more contemporary music but I enjoyed the hymns sung by Alan Jackson. He has an amazing voice that everybody should have in their church choir!
5,Absolutely The Best,"My husband and I were flooded with memories of our grandmothers, Vacation Bible School and the old type church services. We found ourselves singing along with Alan and humming or singing the songs when the CD was not on. We've shared the CD with all of our friends who couldn't wait to get their own copy. We now have a copy for each of our cars and one for the house.Thank you Alan for giving us a piece of our childhood to cherish for years to come."
5,Gift,Glad to find this for my sister. She has enjoyed listening to it and has been to an Alan Jackson concert since.
5,Great Gospel From A Great Entertainer,"This is simply a great collection of gospel songs from one of the greatest voices in country music. A must have recording if you're a Jackson fan, he shows his stuff on this one!"
5,The Way Hymns Should be Sung!,"If you are familiar with the old hymns you will love all of these songs and the way Alan sings them. If you are not familiar with them, you will really enjoy them as well and see why the hymns are so uplifting. So pure and without pounding instruments that just cover up the beauty of the message in these hymns. It is such a wonderful album that will encourage and edify you!"
5,Wonderful,"Loved this CD by Alan Jackson, very uplifting and takes your mind off your troubles and is easy to sing along with. Wish he would do another similar CD."
5,Precious Memories,"The music was great. My husbands grandmother was dying and all she wanted to listen to was this CD. We could not find it anywhere but did find it on Amazon. We ordered it, next day mail, but did not get it for 4 days, but once we received it,,she loved it and listened to it constantly until she died. We played it during her visiting hours at the funeral home and during the funeral the next day. Its an incredibly great CD."
5,Wonderful,"I never thought that I would find a gospel album that I love as much as Don't Overlook Salvation by Ricky Van Shelton. I was wrong. Precious Memories brought me to tears. It features many of the songs that I sang in church in the 50's and 60's. It took me back to the ""good old days"" when, looking back, everything seemed so much better than it is today. Now I don't know if things were better, or just different.In any case, I love and will treasure this CD. Tis So Sweet to Trust in Jesus is so moving. It's wonderful to hear him sing with his wife and daughters. If you love gospel music you will love this one."
5,the best medicine,"My mother recently died of Alzheimers. For the last 3 years, this CD has been her ""sedative"" when she has needed one. Anyone who remembers the old hymns MUST add this CD to their collection. It provides comfort and hope, slow songs and fast songs. You'll be singing along before you know it"
5,Alan Jackson.,"Alan Jackson, Precious Memories, You've never heard anything till you hear Alan sing the older hymns on this album, This is a must have if your an Alan Jackson Fan. Money Well spent."
3,AUDIO PROBLEMS WITH THE CD,"I love the Alan Jackson CD, Precious Memories. Unfortunately it has a few audio problems, such as speeding up. It's a little chipmunky sounding in spots. But I did receive it in a very timely manner and I appreciate that. I just assume that the problem is something to expect in a used CD. And you get what you pay for."
4,golden oldies,"Although not as ""peppy"" as I had hoped, I found myself singing along with the old favorites. It is great for giving as gifts."
3,country gospel music,A bit disappointing. Not vibrant. An ok CD but one I'll probably not keep in our collection
1,Alan Jackson CD entitled Precious Memories,Upon arrival we opened the outer mail package and found that the case had been broken into several pieces. We did not cut the plastic to check the item inside. We sent a letter to the UK asking for instructions. We are now waiting.
3,Alan Jackson CD,It took a month and a half to receive this CD. I was not notified there would be a delay with the shipment until weeks in. I just received it in the nick of time christmas eve and I orderd it November 17th. The product itself is in great condition. Perfect. Next time I would like a little notice if my package is delayed to I can properly prepare. Granted it came overseas however the communication was not great.
2,Get Randy Travis instead,"Not bad, but I still thought a lot of it was over-instrumentalized and some of the timing/tempo was awkward (too slow and/or had lost the rhythm). Randy Travis' _Worship & Faith_ is less melodramatic and easier to sing with."
5,Great classic hymns . . .,Got this CD for a birthday gift and just love it! Alan Jackson sings all the old favorites in a soothing and joyous way. The beauty of the hymn tunes is highlighted by their meaningful lyrics. Makes singing along a celebration!
5,Alan Jackson,I enjoy Precious Memories hymns that are so refreshing and relaxing. I can hum along as I work.
3,not that great,I love Alan Jackson but it seemed his voice was not suited for the religious songs.I also love good religious music...............obviously since I bought the CD.Probably would not have purchased it if I had heard it first.
5,Good Choice!,I would recommend this CD to anyone interesested in purchasing a gospel CD with the good old harmony.
5,Goes to the soul,"I play this CD in my car as I do my errands around town and it makes the experience a lot easier. I love the old hymns from my childhood and this islike a visit to church. I ordered this CD because of the song ""In the Garden"".It is the most touching hymn ever written."
4,Christian Tradition,"For those who were raised in a traditional Christian home or for those who live in one, this is an excellent CD. Alan Jackson's voice is the right tone, with the right instruments to produce the feel of a good church solo. The 15 hymns fit together nicely, producing a body of song that brings back memories. Standards like, Blessed Assurance, Softly and Tenderly, Leaning on the Everlasting Arms and The Old Rugged Cross build a solid foundation for the other selections. The tempo of When We All Get to Heaven and I'll Fly Away is to slow by today's standards. However, this is within the historic norm for white churches.I Want to Stroll Over Heaven with You is an excellent song and very well done. Personally, I'd rather have In the Sweet Bye n Bye on the CD."
5,"Simple, Elegant, Inspired ... Achingly Beautiful","There's a sincerity and simplicity to this album that is simply beautiful. Perhaps it's because the album was originally recorded as a special gift to Alan's mother -- I found this album quite moving. The opening track, ""Blessed Assurance,"" sets the tone and each track has its own special offering. This is a wonderful album, sung in a heartfelt way by Alan Jackson."
5,Great listening,Alan Jackson sings the old hymns just like they were originally written. It's a pleasure to listen to him.
5,Pure Alan Jackson,"I have always loved Alan Jackson's music and when I heard he had made a CD of gospel hymns for his grandmother, I knew I had to have it! I wasn't disappointed. My husband grew up singing those hymns at his grandparents' church in rural Oklahoma and it brought back many ""precious memories"" for him."
1,Not worthwhile,"This is a a collection of ten magazine-like articles on random subjects (hearing protection, some gun reviews) making up 80 pages and an 80 page out of date price guide. Very useless. I highly recommend Gene Gangarosa's books. They have history and reviews of the guns."
4,Short Crash Course on Cash,"Just a short sampler of Johnny Cash's hits, but includes ""Understand Your Man"" which is often missing from other collections."
4,"There is better, but the price is right and it's good to have","This is not Arches, but I love my students having this in any size. I own several because it is less costly than Arches which most art teachers would have their students paint on nothing BUT. I prefer the blocks because I have hard water and I don't like to soak my paper over night and stretch and staple and then dry for yet another day. Blocks are easiest to use and you just peel off the upper paper for the next piece. Product comes with smooth white overlay to protect paper underneath. Decent tooth. Great buy. Buy some Arches for the assignments and buy this for your first trys after the thumbnails. . ."
4,pump splice kt,"good product constructed well, not made of cheap materials. would be nice if they made a submersible kit and not just an underground version. makes replacing a pump a lot simpler."
3,"Good T&A, watch while you use your treadmill","This is a fun video, worth the money (*** 1/2). Some really good looking girls walk and bounce/jog on a treadmill completely naked, and you get to watch (from all angles). Bouncing breasts, and bouncing behinds. I used to dream about seeing this when I went to the fitness center. Use the tape to satsify your sexual fantasies or use it to motivate yourself to walk on your own treadmill. The Playboy videos have photography that is more clear (better images), but Playboy doesn't have a treadmill video; this is unique, one of a kind. There is sort of a raw characther that makes you feel like you could shoot this video yourself, if you had the camera, the GIRLS, and a treadmill (makes it feel real). You will never see this tape on cable tv, if you want to see it, you will need to buy it."
2,"Great idea, poor execution","This video would have been rated a 4 or 5 if the camerawork was simpler. Some of the woman are great looking, and they let you watch what most people only dream about: totally naked girls exercising on treadmills. Unfortunately, the person filming all this eye candy decided to use every cheesy home-video effect the camera offered. There are lots of overlaid image-on-image shots, and that awful color-blending mode that makes you feel like you're looking thru the eyes of ""Predator."" While the idea of looking at a nude female body with a closeup of her face overlaid on top might sound appealing, when you see this video you'll wish they just put the camera in front of the girls and left it alone."
3,"Good, but not great","The new Paul Kirk book ""Smoke It!"" contains some good recipes, many of which stretch the boundaries that we normally associate with traditional barbecued foods. The text that accompanies each recipe is pure Paul Kirk, but the beautifully styled food photos seem oddly out of place. Anyone who's met Chef Paul knows he's a down-to-earth kind of guy, and it's hard to imagine him serving up this food in the settings portrayed in the photos. Despite this bit of cognitive dissonance, it's a good book, though not as useful as ""Paul Kirk's Barbecues Sauces and Rubs""."
4,Best groove/death metal album to date,"This is definitely a genre that I dislike. Bands like Dying Fetus have seemed to acknowledge the mainstream direction of metal more than the ole classics like Altars Of Madness and Seven Churches, yet Internal Bleeding is one of the few groups in this category to actually catch my attention. Brutal, gut wrenching death metal crossed with heart-stopping rut-driven grooves that'll be certain to drive any metal lover crazy - that's the name of the game.For people familiar with Internal Bleeding's earlier works, note that Driven To Conquer is the first CD by this band with a worthy production. Also note that, despite the groove-death tagline, the music here is technical enough to be appreciated by the average death metal fan. Sure, they're definitelly no Suffocation, but with this release, they have still impressed me."
1,Typical & Boring,"This is THE worst death metal CD I've ever heard. Very univentive and it sounds like rehashed Dying Fetus. I could not detect one ounce of talent and the vocals are horrible. It sounds to me like these guys found some ""catchy"" little riffs that worked for them in the past and have failed to try anything else. In fact I think this band only has 6 songs and just changed the titles and lyrics and called them ""New Releases"". This CD is CRAP!!!!!!!!!"
2,Boring and Predictable,"I hate to say this but this release bored me to death.The guitar tone is weak, the playing is okay, some of theriffs are cool. The vocalist is too ""Joe Death Metal"" for mytastes. I can't say it's the worst thing I've ever heard it'sjust that if I'm going to put on any I.B disc it's going tobe their demos and their first 2 cd's...Every song on this disckinda starts off the same: the intros are intense and intricate,then it turns to boring mosh metal. Sorry guys I know you can do better..."
1,DISGRACEFUL!,"Whatever happerned to the band that released 'voracious contempt' or 'the extinction of benevolence""??This is a disgrace. They have lost their brutality and the vocals are weak. I miss the old IB line-up!"
1,Farewell to a once great band,This cd proved the death of a once great band. On this you will find a new singer and guitarist. The heaviness is gone for a more technical approach. Their first 2 cd's from the now defunct label Pavement were their finest hour. They either need to get back their old style w/Rini on vox or just give it up.
1,Give it up!!,"This band should have given it up years ago, after their killer vocalist, Frank, left. The first 2 albums he was on are classics. This cd shows that the band should just give it up. They also are real lame playing live now."
1,Garbage,"This band really lost their edge w/this release. Voracious Contempt and the masterpiece The Extinction of Benevolence put this to shame. The guitar sound is pathetic and the vocals, while not bad, cannot touch Rini's brutal and hateful vox from the first 2 cd's. They should really give it up now, because they are an embarassment to the death metal scene."
5,Wonderfully told stories,This book is wonderfully written. The stories are beautiful recountings of the tales and customs of the people the author grew up with. A great book to have in your library and be able to pull off the shelf.
4,WWII Desk Reference,"Excellent for what it is intended as a ready reference,It is not something that you would want to read from cover to cover."
4,Places you there without overdoing it,"""1972,"" the fine craftsmenship of Josh Rouse is not only an excellent way to come to appreciate this fine singer-songwriter, but to also take a trip back to a great era of rock'n'roll.From the opening of the title track, you can just sense that you are not listening to a run of the mill album of 2003, but rather a chance to go back to a time that you may not have been alive for, but can totally understand and not feel displaced.With appropro backings by the Sweathogs and instrumentation that leads you along those winded city streets and into a pool hall or maybe the arms of the one that had it all feel right. No worries just good times, genuinely without overproduction or loss of sincerity. A well worked album that delivers with each listen."
4,Gets better and better with each listen,"I'd actually give this 4.5 stars if it was possible. It's a fun, varied, and lush sound (includes lots of different backing vocals, hand clapping, funky percussion, horns, flutes, strings, etc). Nothing sounds out of place and it all seems in keeping with the ""1972"" theme. Besides the 10 excellent audio tracks on the CD, there is also a bonus DVD that has the music video for ""Love Vibration"" (which is pretty funny) as well as some videos (mostly footage of the band playing shot on a hand held camcorder) of ""Suburban Sweetheart"", ""Under Cold Blue Stars"", ""Christmas with Jesus"" and ""Michigan""."
2,lame,"Man it this record boring. I like nostalgia as much as the next guy but this Josh fellow has zero soul, even for a white guy named Josh. Just about every rock oir soul record released in 1972 is probably better than this."
2,.,"this album sounds kind of stupid a lot. i'm sort of embarassed it is the 3rd most popular item in my hometown right now. but it's not terrible, brief parts of it have their charm. it just sounds dumb most of the time."
5,fits like a glove,"I read through some of the other negative reviews of this album and, quite frankly, became pretty puzzled. One review really slammed Josh for the lyrics, but they are just that ... lyrics. His art for you to enjoy. This disk, in particular, is fantastically enjoyable because it is light and entertaining. I have listened to the disk over and over and over again and it just keeps getting better. I highly recommend it. Try to enjoy it without feeling the need to decipher the lyrics and deconstruct the sentence structure - taking this route will just allow you to loosen up and relax the music (and life)."
5,Great Album,"A great album from start to finish. It is my third album of his, and they are all among my favorites."
4,I grew up with this album,"I swear this is what was playing on the AM radio in my mom's Malibu station wagon. I still remember those sweet harmonies, the soft groove, the goofy lyrics. Perhaps I'm dating myself, but I'm glad someone finally released a collection of my favorite songs from this bygone era...."
1,Way Too Gimmicky,"This album has been a huge disappointment for me. I have been a Josh Rouse fan for a long time. This 'concept' album is far away from ""Dressed Up Like Nebraska"" - in writing and especially music. Why go to lounge disco Josh? Why? What's up with that?"
4,Mary worked to produce her first book and it's one of interest.,Mary gave me a signed copy when he was at our retreat. It's a scary and facinating book.
3,This book was not helpful for me as a teaching professional.,"I needed to get my resume straightened out for applying for jobs as a science educator at a college level or as a disability/deaf rights activist, or maybe going back into Neuroscience which my MS from med school is in. I found this book was okay for people with high school, work experience, and a first degree from college, but not for someone like me who has 3 degrees and numerous experience in speaking to groups and writing for a variety of mediums. This resume definitely is not for those who need to write something closer to a curriculum vitae, but is adequate for everyone else. Needless to say I was somewhat disappointed because it came highly recommended. Karen Sadler, Science Education, University of Pittsburgh"
1,No recomendado,"Mi intencion al comprar este libro era encontrar ""Nuevos Nombres"" tal como lo dice el nombre del mismo, sin embargo me lleve la sorpresa que los nombres que en este contre eran de los mas comunes y corrientes ademas de que eran muy pocos!! Me fueron mas de ayuda ciertas paginas de internet que este libro."
5,"Estos nombres son tan bellos,","que mi esposo, que es escritor, no se conformó con que nos sirvieran para nuestro nene, sino que LOS USA PARA LOS PERSONAJES DE SUS NOVELAS !"
4,Get rid of those pesky flour moths!,"These Bio Care Flour Moth Traps are great. You still have to go through the cupboard and throw away all the infested products but this flour moth trap will take care of any moths that are left. It attracts the moths to the inside of a sticky ""tent"" that prevents them from laying more eggs. Cupboards clean in a week or two. Great for San Diego area and easy to order on Amazon. Betsy Vernetti"
4,Review of last Martin Beck mystery,"This is the last of the Martin Beck mystery series and for enthusiasts like me and my sons who have read them from the beginning in order this was a good and fitting finish to the series. The characters get a last round of development and by now have become rather endearing to the reader. The authors indulged more than ever before in their rabid antagonism to modern western 'capitalist' trends in society ... at times its so over the top as to be absurd, even if there is a grain of truth to be detected in much of what they say."
2,The disappointing finale,"The tenth, and final, Martin Beck novel. A disappointing finish to an otherwise excellent series. International terrorists strike fear into the heart of Sweden, their motives obscure, their methods deadly.The authors abandon all pretense of reality in this one, focusing on excessively heavy-handed Marxist criticism of all aspects of society. Beck's motivations and actions seem very out-of-character, the plot is ridiculous, and the writing is unusually poor. It reads like a freakish crossbreed of Tom Clancy, Kurt Vonnegut, and Frederich Engels.If you've read the other nine books, you should probably read this one, too, but it's for die-hard fans only."
2,The Terrorists,"The overall story was good, but the characters were one dimensional. I was disappointed as the authors are deemed by others to be exceptional."
5,Maj Sjowall and Per Wahloo,There are ten mystery novels written by this couple. Get one and then read it slowly. Pace yourself in between books but keep them near you. Fall into their embrace and spend time with your friends in the Investigation Team. Slow down toward the end and savor each one. Woe is the day you have finished them all because they are wonderful.Brian Oldham
4,A page turner of a crimmy,"I fealt the subject was a topical one in that it covered the area of terrorism and attemts being made on the life of political leaders with little regard for colateral death and mayhem. The character of Beck is well presented, as usual, and there is a good level of tension throughout the book.An enjoyable read."
4,Fun for an older toddler,"My 19 month old seems to like parts of this video and I have a feeling he'll be more engaged with it as he gets older. The music is fun and he likes to dance with it. If you don't mind a little (or a lot) of Elmo, the adults will be ok with this video too. Some of you know what I mean..."
2,"Too busy, overstimulating","I love Sesame Street and enjoy the alphabet cartoons/short films they make. However, watching 26 of the little films back to back is too much. There is some occasional dialouge, but it is mostly the little cartoons. My son likes it for a little while, but then gets overstimulated. Honestly, it gives me a headache... :)"
3,Nothing Special,"I give this video (dvd) 3 stars based on its inferior audio quality and on the fact that the alphabet is repeated from beginning to end no more than 3 times throughout the entire video. My two year old daughter gives it a 20 out of 26 based on the fact that she said ""no my watch that"" on six of the 26 letters. Not bad, but there must be better alphabet videos out there."
5,Love it!,I love this product! The girls (2 & 5) watched it once and were reconizing letters and making the letter sounds. Totally recommend it.
1,Disappointed,"I grew up watching Sesame Street and when I saw this video, I thought it would be somewhat like the Sesame Street of old. It wasn't. Some of the characters were present, but not in the same spirit of the Sesame Street I grew up with."
1,Truly Terrible Audio Quality,"This DVD has the same audio problem as ""The Best of Elmo"" and ""Kids' Favorite Songs"". I am very disappointed about the audio transfer. It's completely distorted and way too loud. The sound of Elmo actually frightened my 1.5-year-old son. Try it from a video store first. Don't waste money on the DVD."
3,just ok,while this was cute ... it is a bit dated and I was hoping for more ELMO for my 18 month old.
2,It IS a jungle...,"Boy, this DVD is just a jumble of old episodes, which are fine. But, it's just not cohesive overall. Feels very disjointed when watching it.The good thing is my 2 year old loves watching it. She only learned ""m"" and ""u"" from this overpriced DVD, but at least she likes watching it.I must say, I was afraid she wouldn't like ""Meet The Letters"" after watching this DVD countless times, but she does (I highly recommend Meet The Letters, if you want your young ones to actually learn). Oh, she could call out all the letters after watching ""Meet The Letters"" for about 2 weeks. Is it because she watched the jumbled ""Jungle"" for about 3 weeks earlier? Maybe. But, she sure heck didn't call out the letters while watching it (other than ""M"" and ""U"" as mentioned).This is a good DVD that entertains. I would've actually gave it at least 3 stars if it weren't for the price ($[...] B&N;), considering that they only had to create those few new scenes with Elmo, Zoey and Telly."
1,Very Disappointing,"The cover and description lead you to believe that this is a Zoe and Elmo video, however they are barely in it and my daughter lost interest very quickly."
