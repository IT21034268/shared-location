2,"Read ""1984"" instead","Perhaps because it's so lauded I expected more. It's just a 1984, Brave New World, Farenheit 451, Animal Farm or Clockwork Orange for kids -- I guess. It just made me want to read those books instead.There were many unanswered questions at the end of the book. I would have liked to have known why the community was the way it was and how it got there. How did people only see in black and white? How did they get rid of the sun? How did they grow crops if there was no sun? Why are the birth mothers considered so stupid and low, yet they're giving birth to the entire community -- therefore giving birth to stupid kids? How come Jonas isn't stupid?Where is he at the end? It wasn't clear. Or I'm just too dumb to read into things. I would have liked more of a ""fleshing out"" of the community instead of the bare bones we are given. I'll buy anything -- just sell it to me."
5,Great!,"This book is different..definitely different. I read it the summer before sixth grade, and I loved it! I didn't believe that any of it would be true, so I did not start to not trust parents anymore, as another reviewer assumed a sixth grader would. Really...sixth graders are smarter than that! It is kind of sad, but it was great! It was a tad bit confusing, but as a whole, I loved it, and so did all of my friends! I think it should be read the summer before sixth grade or later."
2,No ending,It was o.k. until the very ending. It was very confusing and hard to understand. I personally didn't care for it.
4,Interesting Life,It is interesting to see how this book deals with the diffrences in life between various people and how trying to destroy those differences we work so hard to cover up in our socieities actually destroy the foundation of a life well lived.
4,A must read,I read this book in jr. High and it always stuck with me. So yeah i bought it again and enjoyed it. Just wish there was a part 2. Still great for the imagination.
4,A good book,"In ""The Giver"" by Lois Lowry, the 12-year- old Jonas is selected to be the Reciever of Memory in a community without colours, feelings and freedom. During the training for his assignment, he realizes that it can not go on like this with the community and he tries to change it. Normally, I would not read such a book, because I don't like science-fiction stories. I read it at school and in my oppinion, the book ist quite good. It makes you realize how life would be without natural things like colours or love. The only thing I did not like much was the end. I think the story ended too fast and I consider the end too vague. But all in all I think the book is absolutely worth reading."
3,Good book but definitely for young adults,"I first read this book ages ago, but we selected it for a quick read for our monthly book club this month. Somehow, I forgot that it was a ""young adult"" book so had to keep that in mind while I read it. It's a very short book, and very thought-provoking, but not incredibly engaging. Although I enjoyed the story and definitely recommend it, it wasn't an overly-exciting page-turner for me. I think it would be wonderful for a parent to read along with their young teenager. It reveals a very interesting societal concept and I think would open up quite a few channels for real-world communication for a parent/""child"".(Would give it 4-stars for young-adult readers.)Good read - just make sure you remember its literary level and target audience while reading and you'll enjoy it!"
2,The Giver,"Terribly slow and old fashioned. I really did not like it and struggled to get through it. The story is original and different to most things I read, it just was outdated. Sorry.Ages 18-99"
2,No that interesting,The Giver did not spark my attention. It was very boring and I found myself thinking of other thignss while reading this book. What I didn't like about The Giver specifically was the ending. I found it very difficult to read because you don't know what is happening to Jonas. The ending just plain didn't make sense to me as the reader.
4,The Giver,The Giver by Lois Lowry was an interesting book to read. It was really interesting how the former giver had to pass on information that the former one gained through the years it is like passing down fighting techniques down to your pupil. That what makes a book like this interesting to see what happens next. If a lot of books were like that they would be more interesting to read.
4,A recommended read,"I love ""The Giver"" more and more each time I read it. It is an absolutely unique story that forces the reader to ask many questions concerning life and society. Reading ""The Giver"" means stepping into a world where expectations are that everyone is the same. Slight differences are frowned upon and everyone in the community is assigned a specific role. Jonas is a character that displays a vast range of human emotions which makes him easier to relate to. Watching Jonas' life change throughout the novel is painful and thrilling. This book will leave you wanting more and yet questioning what you've just read. I highly recommend ""The Giver"". It is a great read and I guarantee you won't soon forget it."
3,Best Sci-Fic Book,"When I first started to read this book, I didn't like it at all, but it gets a WHOLE lot better and it is the best sci-fic book I have ever read!!"
3,The Giver By Seaford Reader,"I think The Giver was a pretty good book, however I did not like the ending. I gave this book only 3 stars because it was unrealistic. At first the beginning does not make much sense, but then you start to understand it. I think Lois Lowry was very creative while writing the Giver. I think she should make a sequal to The Giver because it left you so blank with all these questions. I would recommend this book to anybody who likes to make up their own endings to a book and wonder about it."
2,The Giver... A Thinking Book,"The Giver by Lois Lowry is an okay book, but may leave you hungry for more. It is a thinking book, making you ask questions to yourself most of the time.The book is good in the beginning but it has a terrible ending. This one is okay for a checkout from the library, but don't set your expectations to high. It could have been great but the ending brought it down."
2,The Giver.........a weird book,"Can you imagine living in a world where there are no memories or feelings? This book written by Lois Lowry, was alright until the ending. It was pretty cool how you found out that these people are color blind but it was totally unrealistic. There were many surprises that I didn't expect to happen but it was kind of odd that the community didn't even know what pain or love was. I personaly hated the end of the book because they left many things unanswered like what happened to the Giver, what happened to the community, and what happened to Jonas and Gabriel.I would recommend this book to someone who likes wierd books but not to someone who likes good books like me."
3,The Giver,"In the story a child is going into adulthood faster than most people. For twelve years the main character, Jonas, will grow up in what they call a perfect world. This perfect world has no colour , feelings or pain.When Jonas is twelve he is picked to be the new reciver of memories. For a long year after he is twelve the Giver will transmit to him all of the memories they are missing. Jonas finds out what a lonely world he is living in , so he and the Giver make a plan to...I am not going to tell you the end if you want to know read the book.My rating***I give this book three stars because I don't like books that do not have an ending that tells you what happens. So the story line was really good in this book but did not tell me what I wanted to know. The other thing that bugs me is that it tells you that they don't have colour and weather but they do not tell you how they got rid of it.Becky Holden mr.C's grade 7 class"
4,The giver,I liked the Giver because it was exciting. I liked the adventorous things Jonas did in the book. I thought that Jonas being selected as the Receiver of Memory was cool because he is the only child in the community who is special. I was scared at times when Jonas was feeling pain from the memories. I wish that Jonas would have set out to look for the other communities a little more. i hope that there is a sequal to The Giver. I recommend this book to anyone.
3,"""The Giver"" book review","If I didn't have to read this book for a class I would have read three pages and put it back on the shelf. After reading it and and understanding the message the author was trying to send I realized that the book was a nice little bit of literature. It put across to me that all of the little differences in the world should be celebrated, not shunned. All of the little things in life aren't appreciated, and I think Lois Lawry is trying to tell us to wake up and look around at all of the beauty in our world before we destroy it."
3,"""Enter the community""",We read the book in school and I think it was a good choice of the teacher. It's not the best book I've ever read but if you like the theme you should read it. There are some boring passages but there are also some exciting ones. All in all the book is interesting for people who like books about such unrealistic themes. I would have expected another ending but it's a good choice by the author to make you think about it and imagine what happens to Jonas and the boy.
4,Fabulous Read...The Giver,"This book hooks you from the beginning and you don't want to put it down! Every reader cheers for Jonas as he finds free will, yet your heart aches for his not being able to use it. I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars because I thought the ending was severely lacking. The conclusion came too close to the climax of the book. I just like to KNOW the ending of a book without drawing a million conclusions out of imagination. Still a must read book:)"
4,The Giver,"I thought that ""The Giver"" was a very good book. I liked it because it kept you thinking a lot and was very interesting and exiting. The part I don't like is the confusing words and sentences it uses. I also don't like how it lets you decide what happens at the end. I would have liked it a lot more if it would answered the questions that you would want to know when reading a book, like what the noises were when they were sledding down the hill and where they sledded to etc."
4,"Review of the book ""The Giver""","The novel ""The Giver"" from Lois Lowry is about a boy named Jonas who lives in a community. In the community there are no colors, no animals, no seasons and no hills. When Jonas is selected as the new Receiver he sees that nothing is so nice as it seems. He and the Giver want to change the community. And for that they plan Jonas escape.The novel is very excited and it makes fun to read it. It is an unrealistic story."
4,The Giver Reviewed,"""The Giver"" by Lois Lowry.This book is about a boy named Jonas and a man named the Giver.Jonas and the Giver live in a dull, boring communtiy. no one sees color and everything has to be the same.You don't have an age you are a one, two........ When you are a twelve you are assined a job. But when the ceromony of the tweleves come the chief Elder skipped his number Jonas gets scared. ""What did I do wrong"" Janas asked himself.But finally the Chief Elder says""I know all of you think I have made a mistake but we have saved best for last Jonas is going to be the reciever of Memorey.""The giver is the only person who has books. Jonas's favorite memorey was Christmas.The theme of this story is that no places is perfect.Lois Lowry had a great idea to make this story. I really liked this book. I recomend it to you."
5,The Giver,"""The Giver"" by Lois Lowry is an excellent book. There are two very important characters, Jonas and The Giver. Jonas is a 11 year old that at the ceremony becomes a 12year old. Jonas is selected as the Receiver of Memories. The Giver is the old receiver that helped to chose Jonas. The Giver must give up the memories he received, of the past,to Jonas, even if they are painful. This story takes place in a community that is ""perfect"" but very dull. The reason I say that is because the citizens are not aloud to have feelings of love and hate.In the beginning of the story Jonas is an 11 that is apprehensive about the up coming ceremony. During the ceremony his number (19) was skipped over. When the Cheif Elder was done with telling the other 12s their accupation, she came back to Jonas. She told him that he was the Receiver of Memories."
3,The Wretched Review,""" The Giver"" by Lois Lowry is a vrey unusual book. The main character, Jonas, is a very nervous boy. His best friend, Asher, is a boy that is well behaved. Fiona,one more of Jonas's friends, is a smart and caring young women. The Giver is the old Receiver, which Jonas is taking place for.Jonas is apprehensive about becoming a ""Twelve."" Becoming a ""Twelve"" is very important because you are assigned a job. At the ceremony, Jonas's number(19)was skipped and he become worried. But the Chief Elder only saved the best for last!He became the Receiver of Memories"
5,The Giver: A Perfect World,"This book is on n amzing subbject. One that's probaly bounced in and out of oe's mind.You can tell it was well thought out and planned. There are not a lot of deatails in this book but it is one of the few that doesn't need it. It's better to let the mind imagin it.I love this book. It's not exactly inspiring but most deffinently thought provoking.I recomend this book to older chldren, preteens, and adults. There's a little bit for everyone."
3,It was okay... not the best,"I thougth the book ""The Giver"" was an alright book. It was written nicely. The beginning was a little boring, and it took awhile for me to really get into the story line. Jonas was a fabulous character and was interested in all sorts of things. I felt there wasn't really a need for Asher to be there though. But he was a good character. When I finally did get into the book, I found myself wanting more. When I reached the closing chapter I couldn't wait for the ending. When I finally reached it.. I was very disappointed. At first, I was like ""Okay, well there's probably going to be a sequel"", but then I realized there wasn't and was a little disappointed. So, basically I was very surprised that I like this book, because I don't usually like to read. So, that is why I gave it 3 stars."
3,the less you know the better,I thought the giver was an O.K. book. The only thing that I didn't like about it was that it left you wondering at the end. It tells about a whole new journey on their way somewhere else but it doesn't tell what happened in this new place. The mystery in the middle of the book was good but the beginning was really confusing. I didn't understand what was happening until the third paragraph. My suggestions for any one who is going to read this book is don't give up after the first paragraph because it does get better.
5,The Giver,"This was a great book. It's about a boy named Jonas who live's in a strict community. They can't fight, they can't see colors. Each family is assigned a boy and a girl and at the age of 12 a job for life. Jonas is a boy who stands out as being very different from the others in his community. When Jonas gets older, he is selected to become the next Receiver of Memory. This is not an ordinary job but one that has a lot of honor. The story tells how Jonas gets to ""receive"" his memories. It's a really exciting book. I recommend it."
4,The Giver,"This book was an amazing book. Once i got reading the book i did not want to put it down, thats how good the book was. The Giver made you think while reading the story and makes you realize things about life and makes you think about what you usually wouldnt think about. The story is mysterious and adventurous. It's an imagination with reality. wow its a fanastic book. I totally recommand this book. If you are bored and need something new and exciting this is the book to read!!"
4,An exciting book,"I think that the Giver was a thought provoking book. It made me think about what the world would be like with sameness and how lucky we are to have freedom. The ending was a little disappointing. But, it made me think. Overall, it was a very good book."
5,The Giver-,"Imagine a life void of color, of music, of emotion- a life without all elements that give beauty to the world. In The Giver, Lois Lowry creates such a life in a fictional utopian community. The plot follows the main character Jonas's coming-of-age as he realizes the possibilities of a life beyond his controlled world of black-and-white, of good and bad. Though the characters' lifestyle is so different from our own, the reader is able to sympathize with the confusion felt by this adolescent boy, who truly `knows no better'.Lowry's style of writing draws the reader's attention, and as each chapter ends the reader is left yearning for more. Though initially seeming far-fetched, ultimately the plot has an eery possibilty. Could we really be lead to a life of Sameness?Lowry's novel is a must-read for all ages."
5,Never Old,"I remember my teacher reading the Giver to our class back in 6th grade, as was his annual tradition each year (my sister had him a previous year) . . . now 8 years later I still love The Giver! And I am currently rereading it right now. I've never been one to read a lot of fiction . . . I'd rather read non-fictional stuff, but I definately do enjoy this book. It's very unique, and there are a lot of surprises that show up in the book that you don't expect. I only wish somebody would make a movie out of this book! If I was a director sure would!"
4,interesting piece of writing.,"I think this book is a good book because it show how jonas has to make a choice between a conterolled life or a free life. I like how jonas and the giver work to gether to form a new life for all the people in the commuity. I have one question for Lois Lowery and this was a big big pet peeve, were does this story take place!? Over all, I think this book is a must read. I think that Lois Lowery wrote a real work of work of art!I have a few wonders about the book. I under stand the meaning of the book. How do the people get in to the commuity at the begining? Do the 12's continue there school life or do do they start there new life?A 6th grader"
3,The Giver...Great Book!,"I just finished reading The Giver a few days ago and it was really good. I found it entertaining yet disturbing at the same time. The fact that everything is so perfect is almost scary. Jonas, the main character is faced with so many things after he turns Twelve. That's what kind of made it disturbing to me because in my eyes Twelve is still a child, yet in this book they are treated as adults at this age. The Giver himself was like an omen of what was to come for Jonas and I think that's what sets this book apart from any other like it. I really liked this book and I found that I couldn't stop reading it until the end...which was sort of disappointing to me because I have so many questions.-Alicia LadueChicopee High School"
4,It was ok,"It was a little good at first but then it started to get boring.the conflict was lame, I could have solved it in less than an hour.I wauld recomend this book to people who like to read hoursand wont fall asleep."
2,So Sad!,"This was one of the first books I got that I really disliked. My mom got it for me when I was about 11 or 12 and I got all the way to the ""baby part"" (which I'm sure you all have heard about...uck!) I had to put it down because I was crying to hard. I decided to finish it because I really liked the main character and still wanted to know the ending but to this day I still don't know how it ended because that one chapter was haunting me and I could get it out of my head. Anytime me and my friends talk about books in general I always say how I couldn't stand this one."
3,Jason Barcus's review of The Giver,"This book is an interesting story. It is called The Giver.AlthoughI don't like to read, this story is great for anyone who likes toread. I do recimend this book The Giver."
2,The Giver,The GiverBY Tori HallI thought the book The Giver was ok. The beginning of the book started out good but as the book went on I found that it got strange. The book took on a very science fiction sense as it got into the book. The book changed from being a book about a different community to being a book that kept talking about people killing other people with shots. I found it changed around too much through out the book to really enjoy it. And last of all the ending left me confused. I did not know if the main character Jonas had died or if he found A different place or what. I think another factor that made me not really enjoy the book is the fact that we had to read it for school. When you are forced to read something you do not enjoy it as much as if you choose to read it.
2,For Readers12 and under Only,"Written at a 6th grade reading level, The Giver has very little literary or stylistic value. It is filled with cliched rhetoric such as ""intelligence"" ""integrity"", ""courage"", and ""wisdom"" -- words fit for a middle school graduation. Lowry creates a futuristic world that seems too much like a follow up of Orwell's *1984*, and is really a very bland version of *Brave New World*. The themes and ideas can hardly be called original. Though for a children's book, it is quite valuable in its effective warning against modern society's trend toward regimentation and sterilization. As for anyone over 12 years of age, read Brave New World if you want intellectual stimulation."
2,My opinion,This book was not that very interesting since I really don't like reading.I thought this book could make me fall asleep even with loud sounds by me.It could have been since I hate reading long books like this one.But I still read it so I kind of liked some parts of it.I really didn't understand it that's why. Books bore me so don't take it personaly alright.I liked the idea of them trying to save Gabriel.The whole memories thing was dumb in away.
3,What I thought about the Giver,The Giver really wasn't a bad book it was just kind of wierd at the beginning. Once you get into it and understand it is interesting. This book will make you stretch your imagination. It's cool that the author made up a different world. There are some parts that were boring but are necessary for the book. Over all the book was ok.
5,Excellent book told from an unusual perspective,"Although the setting is a dystopian society, it's not just another dystopian book. It's told from a unique angle. Very enjoyable."
5,"If there were more stars, I'd give it more","Wow! I can't believe how good this book was.If you've read my reveiw on My Side Of The Mountain than you know that I don't mess around with reading bad books.This book was great, and I read it in three days.The only reason why I didn't finish it earlier was my parents had to literally seperate me from the book.I know that I shouldn't say bad things about illiterate people I should write it instead, so that's why I'm here. So if you're illiterate you're really missing out. So learn how to read so you can read this book!"
3,"Jason Numbers (Holliston, MA) Review of The Giver","I liked this book mainly for one reason. It really gets you thinking. This is a what if book on how things would be if everything were uniform. This book was interesting because it kept taking sharp and unexpected turns. You never knew where the author was taking you. Although I personally did not like how the book ended it didn't take much away from the book. I like much different endings than the one that this book had. I gave it a three because it became confusing at parts and as I previously mentioned I would have preferred a better, but overall the author makes you think about some very intriguing concepts and does a great job keeping my attention. This is hard, because I often like to doze off while reading, which I found really hard to do because I always wanted to know what came next."
5,Awesome book,"This was an awesome book because it is so interestng from the beginning. It was a real page turner and it told of a perfect community. This book is so good, it almost seems true. You really get to know the characters and start to like them. It is really easy to get into, and you will not want to put it down. Well, in conclusion, it was one of the best books I have ever read and I highly recommend it."
4,freshman at CHS,"I am reading this book for school, and I think it is a very good book so far. Im only on chapter 15 but should be finished soon. When I first started reading it, I wasnt really into it; but the closer I got to the ceremony of twelve, the more interested I got.The thing that makes this book interesting is the fact that only one person knows the history of the world. This is a very good book for young people. Every school should assign this book."
2,disturbing and depressing,"This book, no matter how well it is written, is a book that really has no ending or solution to the problems that the author puts forward. I found it to be extremely disturbing and could not wait for the happy ending to come, but it didn't.Some will like it because of its origianl theme but I for one did not enjoy it very much at all. People who read it should know that its ending is depressing (to me it was) and ultimately pointless."
2,Interesting but incomplete,"This book starts off well with a great story line. Jonas lives in a society where everything is controlled by rules. The rules were decided long ago to eliminate any individuality, any fear, any worry or anxiety. But, as he learns when he is made the Receiver of Memories, a lot has also been lost. There is no color, no music, no love and no pain. However, what starts off as a great story with great potential quickly looses its thrust. It's almost as though the author didn't know how to end the story and grabbed the first thing that came to mind. The ending leaves the reader with many questions. That in and of it self is not bad as long as they are thought provoking questions. But these are not. Rather, the reader is left asking where the rest of the story is. This book leaves the reader flat. There is no closure. Perhaps that is what the author wanted but, if it is, then she chose to give up the story for the sake of a momentary effect on the reader."
5,A MUST READ book!,"The Giver has now become my #1 favorite book. It's full of cliff hangers. It's the type of book once you start it you'll never put it down. It's about a boy who lives in a completely ruled world. Jonas was 12 years old when he got selected for a job in his cummunity,(Every child in the cummunity, once 12 are assighned jobs.) It seems like the pressure of the world is on his shoulders, you'll see why once you read it! We'll, the one who was selected his job to serve the cummunity before him so called"" failed."" So this is the story; He has been given special training by the Giver, who has secrets of the pain of life, which Jonas has never even known of. The things that he knew were of the joys of life, he gets much more of that from the Giver and gets to know and develop feelings of love, sadness ,and hertfullness. The Giver shares the real truth with him and there's know turning back, even shutting out his family ........................"
5,Wow,This book is great. I have read it many times over the years. It is one of my all-time favorite books. The world Lowry creates is so believable and realistic I can see the future turning out that way.
4,A Four Star--Must Read Book!,"I am currently reading the book ""The Giver"" by, Lois Lowry. I started it not too long ago, and I cant seem to put it down! It's definately a book that I would recommend to someone who enjoys reading about excitement, and suspense. It's a very ambiguous story. That goes into alot of detail. Their world is very different from ours, and it makes me thankful for the things i have. However, i wouldnt really mind being Jonas's character. He's the main character and goes through one exciting adventure! But i guess if you want to know what happens, then you'll have to read the book!"
4,This was really good,"I really enjoyed this book. The plot, I thought, was very imaginative. Lois Lowry added a lot of detail, and did a very good job describing the memories. I thought she did a very good job at showing how bad this type of soceity really was. The idea that no one was truly an individual is scary. I would have given this book 5 stars, but I didn't really like the end that much. It ended very abruptly, and left a lot to the imagination.~JP~ Ipswich High School"
2,it is different :0( =0),This is not a really exciting. And it was boring becuse it was way to long and it was weird in parts. Becuse it was not what you think is going to be and it isent what you think it will be what you want to happen. Well have fun reading!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Future fantasys,"Lowry's book about the future is very fascinating, because it shows very realistically what a future society might be like. It is written very easy, so that someone like me, a stupid pupil from Germany, can easily understand it. The first part, in which the community is described, is a little bit boring, but after chapter eight it is very impressive and interesting. I can only recommend the book,which I read at school, because it allows a completely different look at our society and shows what it might be like in the time to come."
2,"great story, terrible ending.","this book has a great story line, but a terrible ending. I really wish the auther would hve either taken off the last paragraph or so, or added a few more chapters. also i found that the way that people were released was a bit disturbing, but the way that jonas's dad releasesd the newborn child was the most disturbing of all, especially how he lied about it. Good book, just skip the ending."
3,Was ok.,"Storyline was great, characters were really good the book starts to take you on a journey of something very new then leaves ya kinda flat. It's like the Author got halfway through the writing of this book and then either forgot the rest or just hurried it over. Elementary at best."
5,GREAT,It reminded me of matched by Ally Condie. I'm getting 50 points extra credit for reading this. My friend didn't like it and I can't understand why but I can't think she even likes reading
4,Fast read,"I first read this book in my 8th grade reading class, many years have passed since then but I still found it enjoyable. A true story of a hero, the ending leaves much wanting, so read the whole series!"
4,The Giver,"I am currently reading this as part of a class study on utopia and dystopia. My, but it was good! I'm supposed to read the book 45 pages at a time, but I read the whole thing instead, with chastisement from my teacher. At first Jonas' community seems like a fun place to be. You don't have to think for yourself, and, strangely enough, you don't want to because you're having too much fun. It is only when you see the truth behind these lies that the community seems only like a place to run away from. The book was very good. The characters were three-dimensional in a one-dimensional world, and the story was very well written. The only thing that really put me off was the description of what it really means to be released. That passage was horrific, gave me nightmares. The author could have made a milder statement that, while still making the point, didn't involve a newborn baby being murdered.Overall a very good story and worth reading."
4,Engrossing,"Place yourself in a world where there is little or no emotion, an ordered community, ignorance of real life and where the word love is meaningless and you are in Jonas's world. This story makes you question whether or not you really want to live in that so-called perfect world. It also shows the horror of that perfect world. And when Jonas does begin to love he sets in motion events that can't be erased and are possibly devastating to the community.The second time that you read the novel, The Giver, by Lois Lowry the story and characters are even more real than they previously were and the story has so much more depth than before. This novel is not only a good read for younger kids, but also for teenagers and adults because there are things in the novel that everyone can relate to.~TA, Pembroke Academy"
5,An intriguing book in a futuristic setting,This book is set in a futuristic setting where there is no crime and the world is just perfect.I suggest that you read the book a couple of times before you will begin to understand the concept.
5,A whole new world...,"...that is what Lois Lowry has created. Right down to the hair ribbons and buttons, this world is all about sameness. It's hard to believe people could be happy living like this. Lowry is a master and she makes you think about and cherish the important things, like snow, sunshine, uniqueness, choice, and love."
5,Fantastic,"This is a fasinating and wonderful book that should be read and loved by everyone. I read quite a few of the reviews, and was appaled! To think that someone could say that one should save their money and read a classic is HORRIFIC. This book by some is considered a classic. This book leaves a lasting but good impression. This book was an insight to another culture, real or not, and that is very valuable. I am in 8th grade and just read __The Giver__for the second time( I read it in 4th grade and have been meaning to read it ever since.) This time, though I understood it the first time, I really grasped it the second time around and picked up little things that I didn't the first which changed the whole picture only slightly, but made the book seem different, and if possible--even better. I could probaly read this book fifty times and still discover new things, as I probably will."
4,"Interesting, well written, and thought evoking.","I just finished reading ""The Giver"" for an assignment in my Young Adult Liturature 4510 class, and I wish I would have read it sooner in life.With it's interesting subject matter, inovative ideas, and easy-to-read structure, ""The Giver"" would be an excellent way for youth to study their own culture, prescribed social boundaries, and their own ideas about what society should be like.I was once asked ""If a book doesn't get under your skin and make you think about it's content, then what is the purpose of reading it?"" I think that Lowry does an excellent job of probing young minds to ask questions and explore new ideas."
4,Decent,"The book the giver was on the first books that I ever really read just for the sake of reading it. Before it I had just read books that were assigned to me in school. And to my suprised it was pretty good. It was about something that I usually didn't read about in school. I thought that the book was very interesting, and really kept my attention. I would recommend this book to some one who dosen't usually read a lot of books just for fun of it."
2,"Good book, horrible ending","What might have been a decent book, was all killed in the end. I am not sure how anyone gave this book 5 stars. It does not seem like a completed book at all, the ending completely left you hanging. I thought at first that it was the first set in a trilogy, only to find out that the subsequent books are not actual follow-up books but rather books with seperate characters, plots and societies. How disappointing! Its like the author got bored with writing the book and decided to just end it. Save yourself some time and skip this book."
4,amazing book,"this book is a great view on a utopian society that was more dystopian than anything. the only reason i marked off 1 star was the $0.50 sticker on the cover and one page was slightly off, causing about half of the letter on the right hand side of the page to be cut off. only 1 page that i have noticed so far"
5,"Perfect companion to 1984, Brave New World, etc.","A dystopian novel from a child's point of view. Most dystopian novels are written from the viewpoint of an adult who is fighting against the goverment and/or ideologies of the current world. In The Giver, Lowry gives us the other side, a child who is happy and content with the world he lives in. He later comes to see his world as oppressive and cruel, but it is this learning that makes this a unique and important work in the world of dystopian fiction. The prose and structure of the book are a bit more elementary (as this is a young adult book) and the story line more straight forward, but these do not detract from the lessons learned. Not to be missed."
3,A Dissenter From the Acclaim Given This Book,"My son wouldn't finish this book. I did, but I didn't enjoy it at all. We're in a fantasy world (something I usually like), but one where the rules of the game are never really explained -- this means that incidents happen without, seemingly, making sense in the terms of the world we are plunged into. Also (and this is why my son wouldn't finish it) the book is depressing in a way I found not only cruel, but gratuitous. I have no problem letting my son read ""The Yearling"" or other books where the outcome is far from pleasant, but the ending of this one seemed nasty in a way that's acceptable perhaps because of the culture we live in. I felt a lesson was being pushed down my throat -- and I didn't like the lesson. I know the book won an award -- but it's not the only winner of the Newbery that may prove not to age well."
1,The Giver left me thinking about what happened to Jonas.,I think Lois Lowry wrote a very fantastic book. It left me thinking for hours about what happened to Jonas and Gabriel. This is one of favorite books ever. You should buy this book.
1,This is a really great book!,"Out of the two books that Mrs. Lowry wrote, that I read, I like The Giver the best. I thought Number The Stars was kind of boring. I liked how Jonas was my age, in The Giver, so I could relate to him a bit. And, even though Gabe wasn't Jonas' brother, I could relate to that, too. So, I could really get into the book, because of that.I didn't like the ending of The Giver, though. I don't think many people liked the ending either. So, I have a request, could you make another book, of the same topic, but with a better ending? I also didn't like the whole release thing. Especially with the twins, how they would kill the one who weighed the least.Overrall I would say this was a great book, and just forget about my rating I put! I really got in to it, even though it was an assignment for my English class, well, now that I think about it, so is this letter!"
4,The Giver,The Giver was a book that shows there is no such thing as a perfect world. It has a great moral and a great concept. I'd reccomend it to anyone. I am in sixth grade and read it as a school book. It's great!
4,The Giver,"Jonas lives in his community not knowing how wonderful the world could be. As a reciever of memories he slowly gets to know the qualities that a community could have and realizes how boring and miserable the perfectly controlled community is. Now he tries to find the Elsewhere and wants to reach a better world. Apart from that, this book leaves open a lot of questions, for example: ""Who created this community?"" and the important one, What happens to Jonas?"" Summing up it was an exciting book and I recommend it to every person of every age."
3,Fascinating,"Lois Lowry's book ""The Giver"" is an anti-utopian novel because it takes place in a future without any fear, warfare and hunger but it shows in that way how difficult it is for Jonas and the Giver to live in a perfect world like that. Lois Lowry is a famous author for child-books which are also interesting for adults. I liked ""The Giver"" very much although the beginning is boring because nothing exiting happens but from chapter to chapter it becomes more interesting and fascinating."
5,Awesome Book,"This was always one of my favorite books growing up. When I thought about it the other day, i knew I had to buy it. I found it very easy and loved it like it was the first time I had read it."
2,ok,"The shipping was amazingly fast. However the book was listed as regular paperback and it was a mass market paperback. Also the pages are all so yellowed it's hard to read. Not what I would have called ""good condition."""
1,Tedious,"Laborious. As writers voices go, this one is droning the minutes of the Petty Bureaucrats' Town Planning Meeting. There are plenty of other dystopias to read, executed rather better. Pace, characterization, vivid description, originality are all notably absent from this book."
1,The Giver,"I thought The Giver was good literature because full of feelings, also, it had lots of description, and last it had a surprise ending. First, this book was full of feelings because all of the memories had a different feeling to them. Next, this book had lot of description because when Jonas broke his leg they went into ALOT of description. Last, this book had a surprise ending. They could have given us a little more detail about what happened to Jonas and Gabe. This is why The Giver was good literature."
2,A Perfect World? How Pathetic.,"I've been required to read this book for my reading class. We took quizzes onit and discussed the book. I really didn't enjoy reading what I read because it'sabout the future with a perfect society. Why would someone want to live in thatkind of place? No competition, and you're assigned your future job, your child(s),and your spouse. How Pathetic. What's the point in life if everything has to beperfect. No wars? No memories? I'm glad to have my memories and I don't want toforget them. The only reason why I'm giving this book 2 stars instead of 1 isbecause Lois did a good job on descibing the characters and what's going on. Ijust don't like the storyline. Now, her other book 'Number the Stars' was fantasticand I rate that a 5 because it's also based on true events. It definatelycreates mood in the story of sarrow and pain. But 'The Giver' shouldn't have recievedthat award. But that's just my opinion."
2,Very overrated..,"I had to read this book for 9th grade APP english. I found that in the begining i was excited to read it after hearing all the reviews and praise for it. Half-way through the book, I knew that i didn't like it, and I wouldn't be persuded into liking it. This book had alot of potential, but it failed to measure up. It didn't get exciting until the end, and the ending was not satisfying. I understand the ending was supposed to be happy, but it just left the story feeling incomplete.."
4,An interesting book,"I just finished reading ""The Giver"" and I thought it was a great book, it makes you think. At first I thought it was a really stupid book, but when I was reading my opinion changed completely! The ending was rushed, but who cares it was still really good ! ! ! !"
1,The Giver,Can you imagin a perfect world but the world isn't as perfect as you think. Well a boy name Jonas finds this out. He becomes the receiver who keeps all the bad memories. If someone dose something bad they get released. It is a place were you first might wont to live there but after a while you think it is a terrable place. i really didn't really like this book. Some parts are that good but you don't have to take my word for it.-Patrick Haberl-
1,The Giver,A boy named Jonas gets a job called the Reciever of Memory. He has to take a pill for something called stirrings. Jonas is twelve years old and has a sister named Lilly. Lilly is eight years old. His dad is a nurterur. No I didn't like this book because its senery is in the futer. I wasn't interested in the book. I would recommend this book to people who are intrested in the futer.By:Philip
4,The Giver,"I bought this book for my daughter. She needed it for some kind of school project that she was doing. I was really pleased with the option to buy new or used and also with the price. It made the book very affordable for us. It took a while to come though. I think we waiting for over a week, but other than that we were pleased with it."
5,"""The Giver"" is the best science-fiction book ever","This book ""The Giver"" is the strangest yet most interresting story I have ever read."
4,In a Perfect World?,The Giver is almost on a level with Plato's Republic. The difference is The Giver is more fun to read.Only a few of the characters have character! I really enjoy a story that reveals the secrets slowly & keeps the suspence until the end as The Giver does.
4,"Moving, Beautiful and Deep","The Giver was moving, beautiful, and deep. The world reminded me a lot of Matched by Ally Condie. I'm glad I read it as an adult. It might have gone over my head if I'd read it in middle school. It was pretty deep and serious stuff. I'm still thinking about it. To be honest, I'm trying to figure out what happened at the end. It had a very high-brow literary feel to it, but it wasn't hard to read. Good literature has three things: first, excellent writing, second, lots and lots of feelings, and third, a nice, ambiguous ending. The Giver has all of this and more. As ambiguous as the ending was, it was still beautiful and I walked away from the book having a better appreciation for life in general."
5,I think this book was well written with vivid details.,I liked this book because I could relate to the main character. The words made clear images in my mind. The trouble with the book is in my opinion it ended to quickly. I think everyone would enjoy this book.
3,"Kind of slow, and confusing","This is one of those books, where you can't really tell someone that's it's good, because a lot of people won't like it. I had to read it in 7th grade, and I thought that it was really slow, and then my mum had to read it, and she hated it so much too. So, I warn you, that it really is up to you to decide if you like it or not. Understand?"
3,Rollercoaster of Folklore for the modern culture of youth!:),"The thrilling life of a young boy is never as wonderful as it could be if the child was able to make his own choices. I enjoyed the book and the story plot, yet I had to disagree with the detail on page 150.:)"
4,The Giver Audio,"The CDs are great! Using them with struggling readers, makes my job a lot easier. The only downside is the packaging does not indicate which chapters are on each disk, so you have to figure out that part as you play them."
4,It is the greatest book published.,The Giver has a boring beginning but it gets more interesting. Jonas discovers the truth behind his community.Jonas unlocks the secrets to the commmunity.
5,The Giver is an EXCELLENT story about a boy named Jonas,"who is selected to be the Receiver of Memories. Jonas lives in a perfect community with no choices and no pain, but when Jonas is training to be the Receiver, he feels pain and war and suffering. He knows about colors and choices and realizes that his community is not perfect. As a 5th grader I feel The Giver is a very excellent book, and I recommend it to everyone!"
3,"A creative and good book, but...","The book was okay in my opinion because of some following reasons. This book have excellent themes and potential by Lois Lowry. It offers some interesting views of what would happen if your abilities and rights to make choices were taken away in favor of more secure environment. However, there were few problems with the plot such as the ending not really tying up all of the book's storyline. Lois could have written much more extensively, especially what happens after the incident near the end of book. (I'm not going to spoil the plot...) Overally, the book was one of enjoyable reading experience I had."
3,A poor ending for an excellent book,"Lois Lowry raises excellent questions for adults (and young adults alike) to wrestle with, in the spirit of all good literature. But while the book is designated ""science fiction,"" the ""GOTCHA!"" ending evaporates into fantasy, leaving the SF reader grasping at vapor.While more and more modern authors seem content to leave countless narrative strings hanging, it's too bad that happened with this particular story. As a result, I don't think I'll be picking up any more of Lois Lowry's books, because I'll be expecting lazy writing (and an unsatisfying read) inside."
3,The Giver.,"Though THE GIVER was an interesting story, with interesting ideas, I felt it left much to be desired. I personally while reading the book kept waiting for it to be brought to the next, deeper, level but instead it seemed to stay on one less meaningful platau. Also the ending of the book made very little sense to me, and although intriguing to speculate upon, I feel more shoul dhave been written."
3,Eh...,"The Giver was a pretty decent book, it managed to create pretty good imagery and insight as to what could go wrong in a controlled society. Though the book drags on a bit and doesn't provide too many interesting details the ending is left far too open to be considered satisfying. This book would be better aimed toward younger children of middle school level."
5,The Perfect World is not always perfect.,Have you ever read a book that's so great you can't put it down to use the bathroom. Well if you read the The Giver you won't put it down.The Giver is by Louis Lowery. The book is in a place that's post to be the perfect world and the main person is Jonas and he becomes the Receiver of Memory. It's an inportant job and then he runs away but you will have to read and see what finds out what happens to him.This is one of the best books I have read and I would reccommened this book to 5th grade and up.
3,the giver,"A boy named Jonas is in a town were everything is perfect until he starts realizing that he can feel love and what happens when you are released which is when you are poisoned.Nobody in the community of Jonas can see colors. They also can not feel any emotions such as love or hate. The Elders ignore or don't know any bad things that have happened. This is partially why they are the most important people, because they can tell people what to do, but not have to deal the problem that might come up.In conclusion I think this would be a great book for you to read because it is a great book to read as a group and discuss what might happen next and what will be the big climax of the book!"
3,The Giver review,"In response to the book The Giver, I have to say this. My virtual high school class is discussing how this book relates to folklore and the lack of it in this society. This book well reflects what will happen to society without the influence of folklore. I enjoyed it because the main character comes to a better realization about the world that he lives in and gets to decide things on his own. I think that the world of today one day could end up like the world in The Giver if we are not careful about what we do. This book may be on the elementary level but it is still an excellent book to read."
4,This is a Great Book,"I found the Giver a very interesting book. It really made me think about what life would be like in a world where everyone is the same. It's a great discussion book, and I really reccomend it for people who need a good read."
3,The Giver,"When I read the book The Giver at first I thought NOT EXCITING WHAT'S SO EVER. After we kept on reading it wasn't all that bad.The story of The Giver is set in a utopia. There is a 12 year old boy named Jonas who lives in a community where there is no fear, pain, sadness, no colour, no feeling. The children are born into a family with only 2 children. Each person in the community receives the responsibility of a job that they must complete. Overall I would recommend this book to People between the ages of 14 and up. Only if they are into this kind of book."
5,This book was great,"I really liked this book.(I read this book in a classroom) I have to admit that at first I was board with the book, but as time passed and i paid more attention to what the reader was reading, I got really into the book and i could really relate to what the author was trying to say in each chapter. I recommend this book to...well, everyone because it will leave you with many thoughts and will make you enjoy the world as it is, even with the major problems we face in everyday life. I was really touched by the main character's courage and his determination. He sets an example for us all. Please take my advise into consideration and read this book."
3,No appropriate reading age,"The most recent time I read this book it only took a matter of hours. It was required reading in both seventh and eighth grades, and now again in tenth. The notion behind this book is sound, however it fails to have a target audience. Its brevity makes it appealling to younger children, however most ten year olds would miss the deeper meanings imbedded in this novel. Older children, or adults, would I believe not appreciate this book because of its length. It would be much better to read Zamyatin or Huxley, if you are of an age to understand the sociopolitical issues that are behind this story. As a book, it is only of value as a diverting read for younger children, with minimal deeper meaning."
4,A Frightening Future,I realy enjoyed The Giver by Lois Lowry. It was very interesting. It's about a boy named Jonas who is eleven years old.He will soon be twelve. Jonas is going to be in the ceremeny of the twelves. That is when you are given a job in the community. Jonas gets picked as The Giver. The Giver has memories of the past that no one else has. But will Jonas be able to except the memories? You will have to read The Giver to find out.
3,The kid who believes The Dragon Has Been Reborn,"To prohibit the reading of certain books because of their ideas is to assume the residents of a community to by slaves or fools, according to Claule-Adrein Helvetius. Censorship is becoming more and more rampant today (especially after that Janet Jackson case.... That was like sticking your head in a hornet's nest). Many books are being restricted from school libraries as well as personal libraries. The Giver by Lois Lowry is one such example. When I first read this book, I was about ten or eleven and did not find anything wrong with it (censorship-wise). Then we read it in 8th grade, and kids could not stop being grossed out. I feel that as far censorship, ideas should not be censored, but things like graphic violence and"
2,No mans land,"Censorship reflects a community's shortage of self-confidence. In the book The Giver written by Lois Lowry almost everything is censored in their community: the ability to see color, pick their own jobs, and read books. Also, there aren't any hills, weapons, music, fishing, birthdays, families, love, or memories. Censorship can be bad or good depending on what you are blocking. America is unlike the community in The Giver, less strict on what to block and what to allow. I would rather live in America because we can see color and we also have more rights."
4,Lasalle springs Middle *!*!*!*!*!*!*!*!*!*!*,"Censorship proves that the world has no assurance in its youth. Likewise, it exhibits an untrustworthy atmosphere by the elders. Screening is one person's beliefs forced upon everyone else. One book that has been banned by some school districts because of censorship is The Giver. In my opinion, I thought it was a very good book. It showed a world of sameness and what can happen when you take away the thoughts and choices of people in a community. Then the characters in the book discover the security is not the best choice. Censorship allows people to decide whether they can share their thoughts without being afraid of how the public will react. This is why censorship shows that leaders have no confidence in the rest of the community."
4,the giver review by:Cory Charlton,"I found that The Giver quite amusing. The Giver is about a community not an ordinary community this community is so called perfect. This book is about a kid named Jonas.(Every year they have an assembly and all of the people(s) birthdays are all on the same day.)This last assembly Jonas received a job Jonas had been selected.Jonas is a very important person in this book. I really liked the book except for the end because it really stumped me did he die ?, or did he live? If you want to red this phenomenal book that is rated to all ages than I guess this book is the book.I found this book the best I ever read. I rate this 4.75 stars."
5,One of the Best Books Ive EVER read (and ive read a lot),"I first read this book when i was in 5th grade. Im a lot more mature than other kids were at that age so for recommendations, it depends. Im sure its ok for 8th graders and up. Totally good book. I loved it! I have read it probably 50 times, but havent lately. ill have to read it again to see what all the controversy is about. i didnt think anything was wrong with it. the end left me hanging, but i like that. it was good."
4,the giver the book i read,"this book really intrested me,but it was not the best thing i have ever read .it could be one of them .i liked the meaning of the book .that it was showing that we should be happy of how we live in freedom and they lived were they had there whole life planned out for them.so i am glad that i decide to read that book .so overall it was a pretty good book."
4,My Giver Review,"I thought The Giver was a very strange book. I thought it was strange because their community had so many rules. For example, they become adults when they are 12, and the men have to apply for their wives and children. I enjoyed reading The Giver. I thought it was interesting seeing a whole different culture. Lois Lowry did a wonderful job making a whole different world and culture. I think people should read The Giver because it is a well written book."
5,aa The Giver,"Very good book about a siotie of people who fallow the rules (or laws) of there communtie. One of there rules consiste o ""No taking apple home from the receation center"". Also at every ago you get something or something taken away like: At age 8 you start your commity hours. Also at age 12 you get an assment (job), and need to start training the falling week.The story mainly takes place around one kid. This kid turns 12 and, gets a rare assment that requirs much training. The giver, his assment, is one of a kind. Only one person at a time can be it."
3,THE GIVER,"In the book, a boy named Jonas becomes the Receiver for his town when he turns twelve and finds out the truth from The Giver. The story takes place in a community that is not normal. Everything is in order and everything is under control. The people have no worries and cares. Everyone is equal and everyday is the same. Each member in Community is assigned a position. When Jonas turns 12, the Community selects him to be the new receiver of memories. Only The Giver knows the truth and memories of the past, and now he must pass these memories on to Jonas. When he finds out the truth that how his father releases babies, it makes Jonas hate his family because his dad kills innocent babies by injecting poison into them. This point of change made him run away from his home, where the story ends questioning what would happen next. I really enjoyed reading this book because it was a wonderful adventurous book. And if you enjoy reading adventurous book, you definitely have to try this one."
4,Review for The Giver,"I would recomend this book to others because it is a very good book and so interesting, it's a very well written non-fictional book. I really enjoyed it and I think that the people that had read it would agree with me.The reason that I like this book so much is because it's exciting and sad and all these emotions all in one. I wouldn't consider this book a boaring book, I would consider it the kind of book that you can't stop reading."
4,Great book for young adults teens 13-19,"This book has the feeling to get into your mind of what it is mlike to die, what you feel when someone dies. It ios a great book to experince, that is why i like it, it has been the second best book i've ever read."
4,My Reveiw Of The Giver,"Would I recomend this book to other's? The answer is Yes.I would recomend this book to people because, maybe it would teach them that the world is not perfect.I really do think it would.Some childeren have learned that everyone and ecerything is perfect.They need a HUGGE reality check.Its not right for parents to tell there kids that it is and always will be perfect.Thats why I would recomend this book to others."
5,my Giver review,I really like this book about the giver it was very interesting.This is the best book I read this year.This one of the book I've paid attention to in class. At the end of the book it leaves you clue less or its just me. There are some parts that are said and there are some parts that are happy.You have to understand it to read the book or you just won't get the book one bit.I gave the book a 5 because I like it and it one of books that interesting.I f you get a chance to read this book I bet you will like it to.
4,It's a good book for school !,"The Giver tells the reader the story of Jonas, who lives in a community, which seems to be a perfect world by having very strict rules. At his Ceremony of Twelve he is selected as a new Reciever of Memory"". That means that he gets to see things which the others in the community aren't able to see. Gradually, Jonas notices how the real world"" looks like.Our opinion:It's a good book for a school-book. The beginning is very boring, but page by page it gets more interesting. Especially the moments when Jonas gets the memories are written very well so that you can imagine these situations. After the first chapters, you don't want to stop reading the book. The book makes you thinking about our own society.We would recomment to read this book. :o)"
3,a utopian world,"the giver is a book about a perfect community in which nobody has to suffer of hunger or illness. Everything is controlled by a committee, called ""The Elders"". The protagonist in the book is called Jonas, a twelve years old boy, who receives the most important assignment of the community. He's chosen to become the ""Receiver"" of the memories. He's educated by the Giver. But during his education he gets to know the disadvanteges of the community. The book ends with an open ending.It's a nice book. As it is a utopian world it's very interesting.cu greetings from germany"
2,the silly book,"it is not a good book , because it is boring . but some of my friends think it is interesting . But i'm not . the beginning was boring but later in the book it was exciting too ."
3,The Giver,"The Giver was about a boy who got assigned his job as a reciever when he turned 12 years old. And when you get to old or you are ill or you just want to be released they give you a shot and you will pass away from there. Jonas'job was to receive the memories from The Giver! His sister had just turned 8 years old and she got her front buttoned jacket!I did not really like this book! It didn't really excite me at all! It was very different, but it just wasn't for me.I would recommend this book to people who just like to read wierd books!"
4,"Almost a dystopia, but quite good.","This book is on my listmainia list of dystopias, because it does show a society gone in a different, and unpleasant, direction. It stands out on that list because, unlike other dystopias, this one requires a few elements borrowed from fantasy literature to make possible the relationship between the Giver and the Receiver.Perhaps if that had been worked differently, this would have gone from four to five stars.As a dystopia, this is one of the rare ""female"" dystopias. A male dystopia shows how each person plugs into the society and how it impacts the family. A female dystopia concentrates more on the family relationships and how they support society. The two are similar but not the same. This makes a good read for the reason of a refreshing perspective.Even though this is considered ""adolescent literature"", it was well written enough for an adult to enjoy. That's also quite a good thing, so parents can share this with their children."
2,"a reviewer from Eureka, MO.","Will BowlingWhen it comes to censorship, I think you can think about what you want to think about, and let other people think about what they want. After reading the book The Giver, thought it was an okay book. I don't really like to read so I don't read books unless I have to. The Giver is a weird book. I don't know why you would have a community with no color or memory or anything like that. It's just stupid. The Giver is a good book, I guess, if you can understand it, I thought it was very confusing because the whole town is colorblind except for a couple of people. And they can't have memory or experience pain. I got confused on that part. Only The Giver and the receiver of memories can see color. But at the end they get back to their community and everybody can see color and they are all having fun."
4,the giver,"Fast read, interesting concept. Good book for book club discussions. Our book club was able to get into a heated discussion about the book."
4,A Good Read,"THE GIVER is a good study of folklore and transcendentalism or the philosophy of the perfect world. It shows how it could or couldn't work, depending on the reader's point of view and how it changes the human being. It is most definitely worthy of its awards and is a good and easy read. It's not difficult to understand and yet provides a deeper meaning for anyone willing to look for it. Definitely 4 stars possibly 5."
3,Memories,"The Giver is about a boy named Jonas who lives in a future civilization with his two parents and sister, Lily. Everything is perfect and everything is the same every day. When Jonas becomes a twelve-year-old and gets assigned to his new job, his job is not a regular job -- it is a special assignment. He becomes the Receiver, a painful but important job. He must receive the memories of past times, good and bad. His leader, The Giver, has the job of giving the memories to Jonas.The author has a way that makes you excited and tense by changing everything in the story until it makes sense. It is unpredictable. It is a mix of confusion, adventure, and a little bit of sadness."
2,"Brilliant Idea, Poorly Written","The idea behind The Giver is clearly a unique perspective on things. It is the type of book where, you are placed in the middle of a totally different area, and you are left to figure out how it works. Gradually, you learn more and more, and things you thought were obviously true, weren't. However, there are some things in this book that are unacceptable. For instance, this society is very complex, and yet, there was still only one active plot throughout the entire book. There was not a single scene that did not contain the main character. This book has the potential to be alot more entertaining to read, if it were to have more subplots. Also, the book is very simply written when it comes to the grammar and choice of vocabulary, thus, you do not have to be ""mature"" to understand this book at all."
2,WAY too depressing!,After reading some of your reviews I've come to the conclusion that I'm one out of a few people that dislike this book. I read this in grade five and I'm now in grade eight and I still remember that terrible part where those two twins were born and the smaller one had a needle stuck in the top of his head. I'm sorry but I found it revolting that abook that is reccomended for children would contain such terrible things.
3,It's OK,Quick. Good story. Well told. Audio. I do too many of these to be able to describe it in another 14 words.
4,The Giver,The book was very good except it ended it ended to abruptly. It builds up the unknown Elsewhere and then leaves you short. The reader doesn't even get to go there.
4,4 stars,"A good book that makes you want to read more. This book had very little action, and a terrible ending."
2,Definitely the little sister of Brave New World,"The is just right for middle-school aged children. It's the idea that by getting rid of the 'bad', such as war, starvation, and suffering, will inadvertently get rid the 'good' , such as beauty, love, and relationships.However, the vehicles used to prove that idea are lacking. 12 year old boys do not worry about their careers; 12 year old boys do not plot a runaway for the sake of a baby; it is not remotely convincing that thousands of memories would come over a community because one person left. The thought behind this book is inadequate.Brave New World has more thought behind it and gets the same idea across."
2,"Great idea, terrible conclusion","The first half of the book is great. It is one of the most interesting stories I have ever read. This is part of the problem. I was so excited and anxious to find out what happens next, that I was hugely disappointed. To sum it up, the ending is a terrible disappointment. It feels like halfway through the book, the author was in need of money, so they slapped together a few more chapters and shipped it."
5,A Book You Must Read,The Giver is one of my all time favorite books. It is well written and the story line is a very different one. The story takes place in a community where no colors and feelings exist. It is a very perfect setting for a great story like this. Read it and you'll be inspired. You'll realize that life is really worth living and there's no such thing as a perfect world.
5,Awesome book,"I read this book in 6th grade as an assignment, and have revisited it every year yet. All my peers loved it, and everyone i know who's read it loves it also. It is a great book for children and adults alike. Lowry is a fantastic writer, she brings this book alive for you and although deemed a children's book, adults will love it also. It really brings up issues and makes you think, but some children (up to about 10 or 11) might not totally grasp the depth of this book at the first read."
4,Very Interesting,"This book was very unique and different. I liked how the author took the idea that was based on the future. I think that The Giver is one of the best books that I've ever read in Grade 6. I recomend this to everyone, so prepare to be blown away!!"
4,An Adventurous and Thoughtful Book,"I liked the book Giver by: Lois Lowery because it made you have to think. The story is about a boy named Jonas who lives in a Utopian Society. A Utopian Society is a community where everything is perfect with no war or fear. Also, everyone is assigned a role. When Jonas turns 12, he gets assigned to become the new Reciever of Memory. He has no idea of the pain and pleasure that comes ahead.I recommend this book to anyone who likes an adventurous and thoughtful story. You might also like this story if you want to read something new or different."
3,"Starts great, but loses its momentum","My wife and I loved this book for the first 2/3, but then the plot lost its way and the characters went with it. I would still recommend reading the book, just borrow it from someone else!"
2,The Truth,"I really liked the book. It was a little different and exciting. I haven't read any books like that before, but I enjoyed reading it. I thought it wasn't the best book I have ever read before, but it was definetly one of my favorites. I rated The Giver 2 stars because in my opinion it needed more work. Overall the book was well-written and it seemed to me that the author put some time and effort into this book. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading books about the future and books that are a little out there. In the book, Jonas' world was a little weird. They had certain rules for everything. They were very precise and they wanted everything to be that way. That's the part of the book that really didn't appeal to me that much. I don't think that it was right the way that the people in Jonas' world thought was right. But there was also some advantages to the way they lived. It was nice reading this book because it was something that I had never read before."
3,Deep Thinking,"To me the Giver was only okay to me. Although much of it made me think, but not as much as the Madeline L'Engles I enjoy reading. The setting in the Giver was a little boring, and at first I didn't understand the beggining. Sometimes I'm still not sure I do. The book made me consider a few things in my life, but it wasn't good enough to change what I thought."
1,A HUGE disappointment!!!,"This review will be short and sweet. This book is terrible. Gave you enough to be interested and left you hanging at the end. I honestly didn't find the ""release"" part as bad as the Hunger Games in which they put teenagers in an arena to kill each other, but that's me! Would not recommend to kids as the others have said. Was so disappointed in the end I was actually mad. I hate when I invest time into a book and the end just stinks. Wish I had the past few hours back!! Ugh!!"
1,This book is deffinately not meant for children!,"The Giver while deffinately not a dry and boring book should not be included in the children's reading category. I have been doing an independent study on Newberry Award winning novels at my highschool and I must say that I can not figure out how it was chosen when it does not fit the criteria. The topics of suicide, murdering of children, and profanity would scare any child!The adult book has been disguised as a child's and should return to the proper placing."
2,Not Good,"The GiverThe Giver was sort of a desturbing book. For example, while the old man was giving up his memory to Jonas, he was losing his own memory. I didn'n really like it , because it wasn't interesting enough for me. The book, however, would be interesting to some people, because of its mysteriousness. The book makes the reader think about our society today as you try to figure out what's happening."
1,The Giver Review,"The Giver, by Lois Lowry is a very boring book.The characters are very polite and appoligize way too much. The setting is very boring because it has no color.In this book the character Jonas is chosen to the Reciever of Memories.He dosen't like the fact that him and The Giver are the only ones who can feel pain.At the end of the book |Jonas makes a big decision.I feel that this book was very boring and has no action. I also thought this book was too long, but I like short books. This book has 180 pages. I didn't like this book because not everyone can feel pain.The part I disliked the most was when Jonas made his big decision at the end. I feel the author could have made his decision seem even bigger.I would have liked this better if Jonas would have shown more pain. I don't request this book to anyone."
1,The Giver,"I hated this book. It was really stupid. It had no point, and come on a world with no choice, color, and pain. It is totally unrealistic. I gave it one star. Nobody in the community has memories except the Receiver of Memory. I did not like it because I don like books that are stupid."
1,I did NOT like this book,"I have enjoyed previous books by this author, but this is one I did not like. Rarely do I dislike a book, but this is at the top of my absolutely did not like list. I will say that it is powerful and thought-provoking reading, but I felt my soul, my being, was being ripped apart, and all that I have believed and hoped in was being questioned"
4,A Fascinating Story,"My son bought The Giver at a bookstore. After he read it he asked me to read the book because he thought it was not only a fascinating story, but very educational. I wasn't sure I really wanted to read a teen book at first, but once I started reading it I couldn't put it down. I read the whole book in one day, and I'm sorry to say but my family had to fend for themselves when it came time for dinner.Lois Lowry does such an excellent job of describing his characters, especially Jonas, and the city where everything is controlled. This is a great read for middle school students through adults. I would gladly recommend it to all my friends."
5,This book was great! I loved it!,"The Giver by Lois Lowery was one of the best books I've ever read. It's a little bit different then from some other books you might have read, but the way Lois describes and makes you feel like your actually there is wonderful. If you're ever looking for a book, get The Giver."
1,The Giver,This book was the most bull s*** ever. I had to read it in school and it sucked. The ending was crap. This book was not swag. Yolo
1,the giver,"Not my kind of book! Without love, understanding, consideration. Its just like ur being told how to act & feel."
1,Identical Twins!,"Hello every body! I recommend you read this before you get the book.Hello, I just finished reading this book and found it super disturbing and offensive. The thought that for Identical twin boys (whom I am) and the smaller one gets killed and put in a garbage shoot just makes me get into tears. Thanks for reading this and take it into consideration. Thank you- Sky"
3,Tricky,"This book was part of my 8th grade reading list, and I must say I was shocked. Whatever message the book conveyed, it frankly freaked me out. I do not reccommend it for the emotionally unready."
3,THE WORST!!!!!,"This book should have never been read by a kids mind. It has babies that are killed with a steroid injection. I do ercomend this book to a young mind. I couldnt belive that someone would have a cruel enough to imagine everyone color mind. It had the worst ending ever and i think that the author of this story was crazy. She took away color, memories, touch, taste, and smell. I hope that you will never have a child read this book it is discriminating to deaf, mute, and anyone who has lost one of their senses.-Not-a-hater"
2,The Giver--Ryan,"I don't recommend the book the Giver to most people. It has a poor mixture of mystery and drama. If you like action books, this one's not for you. It has a dull plot because it takes place in a discrete area that is disconnected from society that we know and love. Everything is perfect, except for one thing. The freedom of choice we have does not exist in that world. The main character is a young boy by the name Jonas. He is chosen to take on a job that the community depends on. He has to receive many memories of the past in order to protect the future, yawn. if you were to like the book, Charlie and the Chocolate factory, this ones for you."
2,* * Giver * *,"I must say this book is creative and its not like any book I've ever read. New and fresh, but it didn't interest me much. At the beinging I found it weird and had a stupid story line. At no point in the book was I excited to know what happened next, and it was definitely not a page turner, it didn't interest me."
3,The book was very interesting.,"Lois Lowry`s book ""The Giver"" is very interesting.It is about a world in the future where love,pain and feelings do not exist.At the Ceremony of Twelve Jonas ,a twelve years old boy, is chosen to be the new ""Receiver of Memories"".After this day he gets the point that life is not so perfect like he has thought before. The book is written in 23chapters.In my opinion the first eight chapters are a little bit boring.But after the Ceremony of Twelve in chapter eight the storie changes.It is very fascinating because you gets an interesting insight into the future.I can only recommend this book,because it is very interesting how other people think about the future.In this book the future is discribed realistically."
4,The problem of creating a painless world,"Lois Lowry's novel ""The Giver"" deals with the prolems which a perfect world -one without pain, hunger or diseases- might cause. I think that this is the most provoking book I have ever read. With echoes of ""Brave New World"", Lowry examines the idea that people might freely choose to give up their humanity in order to create a more stable society. The story is skillfully written and the theme of balancing the values of freedom and security is convincingly presented. Lois Lowry steps beyond the limits of the life we know and develops new concepts never thought of before. Skillfully she brings the latter into the reader's mind."
4,Good but not so good,"The book overall was great. The Giver talks about a utopian society that aims for sameness. The receiver escapes and causes the memories he has received go back to the people. It is all good except that in the last chapter it is a terrible ending. The receiver is ending his journey and yet the author cuts it off with that he saw lights and remembered love. Then it all ends. No mention of how it was like to get to the houses or anything. Completely terrible ending. And the trilogy as described in wikipedia is loosley connected. In fact, not even the same main character is used in the next book, gathering blue."
4,The end was a bit of a downer.,At the end of the book hod no great end at all. The rest of the book was very nice and easy to follow. I think that all children should read this book.
3,"The story is imaginative, but the ending is not satisfying.","Because Lois Lowry received a Newbery Award for this book I began reading with high expectations. They fell flat. I was very disappointed with this book. I am not a big fan of fantasy/science fiction and this may have been one of the problems that I had. The story is highly imaginative and very well told, but the ending was not satisfying. If you enjoy science fiction/fantasy you may enjoy this better than I did."
3,strange,"Hi,I'm Mary Anne Vallee from Cadillac Middle School in Michigan. I'm in Mrs.Bartelson's seventh grade english class. We have read your books Number the Stars and The Giver.Number the Stars is a really awesome book. I think it's better than The Giver. That book left me confused.Iwas wondering if you were going to write another book that explains what happens to Jonas and Gabe.It was discusting when Ifound out what ''Release'' meant. But anyway, I just wanted to tell you that I thought you were a really cool author."
5,One of the Few Stories I Still Remember,"I read a lot of young adult books growing up, and I couldn't tell you the names to more than half of them any longer, but The Giver is one of those books that I distinctly and vividly remember to this day. It was one of the first exposures I had to a dystopian society, and made a lasting impression on me. Some of the situations are disturbing - I remember getting nauseous when learning about the main character's father's real job within the society. But this was a wonderful book that shocked me and made me think critically, whereas most of the other books in the genre were merely mind fluff, or TV in writing."
5,The Giver,"Excellent book! I didn't realize this was a trilogy, so have already ordered book #2. Very good book for a bookclub."
3,Sadly Predictable... yet Strangely Endearing,"The Giver is a well thought out book with excellent descriptions, realistic characters, and a strong moral, and yet it follows a depressingly familiar path worn to a rut by Aldous Huxley, Ray Bradbury, and George Orwell. Lowry obviously thought very hard about what would be the most realistic and assessable utopian society and wrote a tight and believable description of it which gives the reader a strong, but not overbearing, feeling that this indeed could happen. Sadly enough, Lowry's ingenuity and superb writing skill are overshadowed by the superlative predictability of the plot. The triteness of yet one more anti-utopian society will probably be lost on reader in the intended age bracket, but it would be hard to cover the fact that Jonas takes a while to make revelations anticipated by his audience, and his readers will be ahead of him throughout most of the book."
5,You will find a part of yourself in this book.,This book is amazing. It takes you on a ride through a futuristic world of imagination. In reading it you will feel the pain and confusuion of this boy and how his life will never be the same. If you read this book I promise you will never forget it!
1,not a childrens book!,"It is not hard to understand why the content, though seemingly complex, is in fact shallow. It is written for mentally careless or untrained people, especially children, that can be easily led astray if the content does not bring attention to unresolvable problems. Insofar as being used as class assigned reading material for study it should be recognized that most teachers are incapable of sufficient analysis of its content in order to explain it properly to their students. MY LIL 9yrs old got this assigned,.... OHH myyy!!!!!!! She had nightmares for days!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,My kids hated this book,"Just a note to say my smart, high honor roll children hated this book. It was a 5th grade assignment. They thought it was not believeable and just played a little game of which would be the lesser evil, reading this book 15 times or ""The Lovely Bones."" I haven't read it, just reporting their sub-optimal reactions. Considering I would like my children to develop a love of reading, this book doesn't seem to fit the bill, though they did say it was thankfully quite short."
1,My name is nish and i hate this book!!,"This book had foul moments of terror! I read it to my brother Ackmed and my 5 cousins Hockmoud, Backmoud, Ockmod, Mah, and Dod. They are 7 each of them are 7 they were scared of the book! I do not reccomend this book to anyone!!"
1,Makes no sense,"I was supposed to read this book for seventh grade, so when I was reading it, it makes no sense at all. I mean When a little girl turn to an 9? what does the nine mean, and in this book this person put has twice, and I would not read this book again, and listen to the person who said only take it from the library, dont buy it, thats why i am rushing to read it. kids like me need a book with laughter, adventure so we kids would read it more, so if you want this book, be careful of buying it, cause this book is a peice of (junk)."
1,Worthy of Awards? I Think Not,"My opinion of ""The Giver"", is the same opinion as theone I have about Puley Shore movies. They're quite entertaining in thebeginning, but after awhile, the plot gets dull and eventually loses its flavor. The idea of having a perfect society is a good idea for a story, but dragging out the idea that the characters have no emotions gets a tad bit annoying. I get the idea that the characters have no emotions, but Lois Lowery has to tell the reader every other sentence. She acts like the reader is going to forget or something. I admit, the beginning of the story is good; how Lowery tells you about the society's rules, and the Giver's job, but after all that is said, she says the same thing over again. And the ending was the worst ever in the history of literature. This is a horrible book. I suggest it to people who like to get cheated when they read or anyone who saw ""Lost in Space."""
1,Doesn't make any sense!!!,"I've read this book, and I didn't get one thing out of it. It is such a ridiculous idea that a world and its inhabitants do not have any feelings or memories. What a croc."
1,not my choice,my class had to read this book for school. it was a very. . . interesting book filled with death. i would not recomend this book. nobody in my class liked it. it is an unnerving book. it was slow and boring in my opinion.
2,Not this Seaford Deader's favorite book,"The Giver was an odd book. The beginning was terrible but the middle and most of the end was interesting at times. At the end of each chapter something happened that made you want to read more. I wouldn't reccomend this book to anyone who likes lots of action and thrills, because The Giver hardly had any. Also, if you don't like to think a lot while reading, this book is not for you. There are also a few deaths, so if you get upset easily don't read this."
3,"This book is weird, but I liked it.","Over the summer I read a book called the ""Giver"" for my PRE-AP language arts class and I really liked the book. I liked some parts of the book and some parts i did not like or did not understand.If you wold like to find out about more of my review please read on. The parts of the book that I really liked about the book were it's elaborations and how on some parts ho they made it clear and how they had great allusions and alsohow they made characters names fit the books such as Jonas,Gabriel,The Giver's name. Jonas which means (dove a symbol of peace).In the book how they showed this is when jonas found out that release meant to kill.When Jonas knew exactly what it meant he knew what he had to do and that they were going to release gabriel,he took Gabriel and took him to elsewhere and he left everything he knew and loved and left it behind just to save someones life not worring about his own."
3,The novel The Giver was a great book.,"The novel The Giver by Lois Lowry is a very good book. The reason why I think this book is so good to read is because it giveslots of good details about the main characters and the community. Next, in the beginning of the book I reed that there was a kid named Jonas that always saw unidentified aircrafts flying over their community which I didn't think was so interesting in the first chapter. I think the author should of wrote different things that would have made the first chapter sound more interesting because when I reed the first chapter i found it rather boring but then when I reed more and got to the middle of the book it got more interesting because it had more action and other stuff.Then When I got to the end of the book I wanted to read it over and over because it was so good but I didn't get a chance to. What I really want to know about this novel is if something really happened like this before."
3,"I liked this book, and I hope that you will read to.","The Giver is a very inspirational book.It makes you think about how things would be if we lived like Jonas and his family, and the rest of the community. I would recommend this book to you because its different and interesting. I liked the book at sometimes because there was a part when you turned the age of twelve you would be assinged jobs of different areas of the community such as the Giver, Caretaker of the old, and there were many others but I am not going to give those things away. I liked the book and I hope that you will too."
3,This is really a good book for seventh graders to read!,"During the Summer I read a fantastic book called, ""The Giver."" I think this book would rate a three star, on a scale from one to five. This would be about average. If there was a movie, I would rate it a PG-13. Why I rate this book a three is because I do not think some kids understand parts. For example, when Jonas has his flashbacks they tend to get confusing. This would be one of few major setbacks. I do not think I liked any part of the book the best. The reason is because I did not think the book was really that bad. I think you should read this book because it can teach you many new things. It teaches you of love, mystery, desire, hate, fear, and many others. It can teach you how to survive some of life's tuffest rides. To conclude my review, the book was great. Louis Lowry shows strong deposition in her writing. To me, that is a must in a good writer. this is my overall review on ""The Giver."""
3,"The Giver, by Lois Lowry ws an exellent book, as a drama ser","The Giver, by lois Lowry was an exellent book as a drama series. Although it didn't have much action, The Giver was still a good novel. I like this novel because it has a variation of elaboration. If you are a firebrand, or emotional personIdo not recomend The Giver. If you can handle sad stories you should read this book. On a scale one to ten I'd give it a seven. I'd give this novel a seven because it had such goog elaboration, that I could almost see it as a movie. I took those three points off because there was not enough action. Me, Ilove to see action. The Giver was to realistic for me to enjoy. It was okay but Iam not that type of realistic person. I beleive that you should read The Giver if you like the type of story I have just explained."
2,Predictable,"The main character Jonas isn't happy with the form of government in his community, so what do you think he will do, run away? Well that was hard to figure out. No suspense or action is to be found in this boring novel."
1,Shoot Me,"I read this book in about fourth grade, and I absolutely loathed it. I decided to give it another shot, and once again, found it lacking. Definetely not reccomended."
1,I like fish better than this book,"The Giver was a very a weird twisted book. I do not approve of this book because it had way to many details that it got boring and it needed a better ending. I have to admit, that at the end there was a lot of suspence. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone because it made me think. I like books that tell you what is happening, not books that make you figure that out."
1,the real story,"i want to say that the real jonas,is in real an ALBANIAN!!!!The albanian has git the idia but they havent a pen to write...just that u know."
3,The Giver Review,"The Giver is good literature because it is full of adventure and action. Also, it has believable characters. It has a surprise ending. The Giver is full of action when Jonas gets the memories of sledding down a icy hill. "" Sideways spinning, the sled hit a bump in the hill and Jonas was jarred loose and thrown violently into the air."" Also, the escape Jonas did was full of adventure and action. The Giver has believable characters even Jonas was believable. Asher is also a believable character because him and Jonas act like people in our world do. Finally the ending was a big surprise. It was did not think the ending would be like that. It wasn't a good ending because he finds a random sled and slides down to a hill and hears music. This is why the book is great literature. It has a surprise ending, believable characters and full of adventure and action."
2,The Giver Review,"The Giver was not an example of good literature. It was confusing, and it had to many unanswered questions. Also, it was difficult to understand. The Giver was confusing because when she had the characters speak, it was hard to follow who was speaking. Also I think that the end was confusing as well because no one knows what happens. It's one of the many unanswered questions that could easily be answered; she never cleared it up so you don't know what happens to Jonas at the end of the story. It was confusing because when the Giver speaks about Rosemary and why she applied for a release it gets confusing because you can't tell weather they are flashing back to the past, or the present. ""One for here, one for else where."" Lily chanted. The quote was hard to understand because when she was talking about it, we don't know whether she meant for one of them or the twins that were being brought into the community. All in all, I think that The Giver was not good literature."
2,Children's book...,"I guess I didn't realize that this was written for someone's whose brain has not gone past 12.The best children's or young adult books don't every write *for* that crowd... this one tries hard to dumb down ideas, words, vocabulary--the whole thing.Wish I could get my money back."
1,Not for Discerning Adults,"I liked it better the first time I read it, when it was called Anthem (by Ayn Rand)."
1,"A confusing book, with a horrible ending","This book is horrible. I had to read it for an English project, and endured excrustiating pain while reading it. It doesnt have a point. The end doesnothing for the community, and just complicates the meaning of this book. Did it actaully have a point?"
5,The Giver,My son read this book last year in the 7th grade and suggested several times that I read it also. To get that accomplished he made it my summer reading assignment! I am very glad he pushed me to read it. It is a very compelling book and one you won't soon forget. I highly recommend it to anyone - and particularly to anyone whose son or daughter is reading it at school.
5,"A masterpiece! It's ""Pleasantville meets ""The Truman Show.""","I just graduated from college with a degree in Elementary Education. I read this book to see what type of literature upper level readers would read. I did not know that I was going to read such a wonderful piece of work. This book is so touching. When the reader finds out the secrets of such things as the releasing and who The Giver's daughter is, one will be surprised. There are twists an amazing surprises on each page. Lowry has got a brilliant mind! I would also recommend ""Number the Stars."""
4,Nothing is ever Perfect,"Turning twleve in any normal world would just be another birthday, but in the novel The Giver, Jonas is about to experience the the biggest day of his life. Living in a perfect community with no pain, hunger, color, or differences between anything, Jonas is given his ""Assignment"" for the rest of his life. He is given the job that is highly respected in his community, the Reciever of Memory. As he recieves memories from an old man, known as The Giver, he begins to realize that his community is not so perfect and everything seems to be an act. He begins to feel out of place because he doesn't agree with the rules and assignments the community gives. But he can't leave his family and friends that he has been with his whole life. Or can he? He decides he has to do something and fast. As the novel ends it gets confusing and hard to understand. This novels is very similar to Brave New World, but in The Giver, author Lois Lowry just keeps you wondering, what if?"
2,My Giver Review,"The Giver is a pretty good book to read. I recommend it for advanced readers so that they understand it. It is about a boy named Jonas who has an important job. He is the Reciever of Memory. Jonas recieves memories that his Community never saw. There are a few things that the Community doesn't have that Jonas saw before. There is one bad part. The book describes a release. Overall, The Giver is an okay book."
5,This Book Rules!,"I had to read 3 books over the summer for school so I was wondering around the book store and found this book called ""The Giver"" I read the back and so that it earned a award so I decided that would be the first book I read for the summer...... I started reading the book and the next thing I knew I couldn't but it down. This book really makes you think and is very very interesting.... I recommend this book for everyone! I dont really like reading but this book made me cause it was so interesting!!!!!!!!"
5,"My favorite book, STILL!","I am 15 years old and I read the giver when I was 11. It remains my favorite book, and sometimes, I just read sections of it now, because I love it so much! It is an example of how Lois Lowry ""thinks outside of the box"". It is creative and thought provoking and definately a must read."
2,Required reading,"This is one of the required books that have to be read over the kids summer vacation. I'm the parent and found it very interesting, but the children that I've talked to; >20 have found it very dry.Have your kids read it with plenty of water"
2,'Anthem' for kids,"I'll give this book two stars for the fact that the writing wasn't really heinous and its just a warning about conformity. The book really isn't terrible, just cliched. The old horse of 'they had perfect lives, but they did not love' is trotted out once again, and the entire 'supposedly utopian but secretly evil' society that the author crafts is self-indulgent and unconvincing. In short, this is ""Look everyone! I'm writing serious material!"" work, a dumbed-down 'Anthem'. Yes, it's nicely allegorical, but there are other books that carry off the utopian theme much better, such as '1984', 'Brave New World' or the aforementioned 'Anthem'. It's truly painful to see teenagers learning this in school and taking it as the epitome of Utopian allegory."
1,Caution,"This book is not for everyone. My child had nightmares after reading chapter 19 which I would easily rate R for graphic detailed violence. For parents who take their responsibility of monitoring the material their children are exposed to, be sure ahead of time that your child will not be emotionally upset by the ""how - to"" description of the actions. In my opinion, there are no redeeming qualities to this book. My child could not evaluate anything to do with the book because she was obsessed with the murder of an innocent new-born baby. While other people may say that it's not real, the subject of euthanasia is real. I would never recommend this book, however, I would caution parents, and teachers alike to evaluate the person for whom the book is being selected and determine if he/she will be negatively affected by it ahead of time."
2,Didn't work for me,"After looking at all the rave reviews...it must be me. But, ""The Giver"" fell flat for me. I really really like the beginning and I liked the world that was created, every body so polite and all. And then you find the bad things behind the curtain. In fact I liked the polite world so much that I wouldn't object to ...the bad things behind the curtain, that make the society possible.The latter book was so unsatisfying, like how could there be no sun, but stuff grows, and how could there be no color?This book has a great story idea, unfortunately it doesn't flesh out.PS I especially liked the dinner scenes where each member of the family has to politely wait for other family members to share their day and then they comfort each other! Great stuff!"
4,Makes one appreciate what we have today,"Twelve year old Jonas is chosen to be the community's Receiver of memories. His job is taking care of retaining all the messy stuff such as emotions, mistakes, pain. However, at the same time Jonas learns about ordinary things like color, snow, mountains and more. One of the most painful things he learned was what ""released"" meant in his society, which was death. Once Jonas realized the dark secrets behind his community he decided to free himself. Jonas set of on a journey to find the other world where feelings and color and all the other beautiful things about life exist. I personal loved this book. It made me appreciate what I have today and made me think about what it would be like living in a perfect society. While reading the book I was able to realize how depressing and dull a society like that is, but I still recommend people to read it. It will really make you think!"
2,A good read in class,The Giver is a good choice for reading in class since it is written in quite an understandable language and contains a lot of helpful annotations.I personally wouldn't have read this book outside school. I found it boring and not interesting to read. The story is confusing and ends too suddenly.I would have wanted the Auther to continue the book a bit more to find out how the community develops.
5,History without the boring.Mermorable.,"I came upon this book at school.The Giver was ordered to be read for assigments.Most students objected to such things, stating that they are boring.Though at the end of the read I left.I didnt remember its name or its publisher but the story stuck in my head.I would suggest you read it seriously.It might not be as exciting or fast paced as some other books teens like, but it will stick to you."
4,Great Book Worth Reading,"The Giver is a book that appeals to a wide audience. A wide array of ages can enjoy it because it is an easy read, has a good plot and keeps the reader on their toes, guessing what will come next in the book. I read this book for school when I was 10 and enjoyed it. I recently revisted the book and enjoyed it even more the second time. I think that Lois Lowry is a wonderful author because she writes in a way that intrigues but helps the reader maintain clear comprehension"
2,Disappointing,"I had high expectations for this book, because Lois Lowry's Number the Stars was phenomenal, but these expectations were just not met. Jonas is an interesting enough character, and the giver/receiver concept of inheriting memories is interesting, but the ending of the book fizzled out, and I was very disappointed."
4,It's worth reading.,"I had to read this book for a class. I had no clue what the book was about when I started it. But I actually liked the book. I thought that the main character Jonas made a great change in his character from the beginning to the end. The plot was great and it was a fast, easy read. Anybody who wants to get away from the world for a couple of hours should definately read it."
4,interesting,"This book is interesting with some life lessons. Its a little like the hunger games, but i would not recommend it for any one under 12. Its a little dark and some parts are inapproaite, but its gets better towards the end."
5,The Giver,The Giver was a very exciting book with a different point of view. It teaches us that color doesn't matter. Our class read this book and enjoyed it!! You will have fun reading it and we recommend this to anyone!! 7+8 grade at CTL!!!
5,I loved this book!,"My thirteen year old son gave me this book to read, and I read it in one day. I loved it! I was surprised that it is classified as a young adult novel, when I personally think that adults or people of all ages can enjoy this book. Does anyone know if it was ever made into a movie? It should be. I think I would like to explore more of this author's work."
4,"""The Giver"" Reveiw","I think the Giver by Louis Lowery is an excellent book for school, and I would recommend it for anyone who would want a good book to read. The book starts of slow, and basically describes the community that Jonas lives in. Then, later in the book, Jonas is selected to become the next receiver after the last year's failure. The book then goes on a magnificent journey to free the community of it's ""sameness"" that was there for so long."
5,phenomenal,I read this book because it was required reading for my daughter entering sixth grade and I wanted to see what the school was giving her. I was very impressed. This book is really thought provoking and interesting. I couldn't put it down.
3,My coment on The Giver,The Giver is a very interesting novel about how our future could be one day. There's no individual life anymore but therefore a very well structured public order which makes the life of every citizen in this new world much safer. You'll be surprised and maybe you'll have some conflicts with yourself because you'll realize that there are so many pros and cons.
3,The Giver...,"The ""The Giver"" is a ""wiered"" book. Its storyline is quite unexpected, and basically the story isn't really what I like to read. But it turns out that the sense of the book is of a deeper meaning, and afer spending a while thinking of it I realized tahat it's at least a good Idea for a book. But honestly, the ending could be much better. I won't tell why, but be warned. After all the book is easy to read and quite interesting"
3,their world is our world,"reading 'the giver' gives you the opportunity to think about the brutality of our own world. an ending which leaves space for speculation is the adequate one for such a story. many found that disappointing and disturbing, though."
3,My Review on The Giver,"The Giver was a well written book. You Could not guess what was going to happen next. I have not read many books that are insteresting most of the way through. The book kept saying people get released and go to Elswhere so you think they go. Actually they are killed. Though in the book every thing happens the same way except for the memories,and when Jonas ran away. They had their own story line.The only part that I thought was bad was the ending. Personally I thought it was just plain dumb. They were going down a hill and Jonas heard music and it just stopped. To me you don't just stop an ending like that if you are not going to write a second book. She could at least have told whether he made it or not. Except for that, the ending was good. She described it well and left you in a lot of suspense. The end was the only part I thought was half bad.That's what I thought about The Giver.7.3EC"
3,Review for The Giver,"In my opinion I would give The Giver 3 stars,because the book was only okay. It was a little boring, but I liked the part when he was learning to become the Receiver. The end of the book didn't have enough detail to attratct my attention.I think the best part about The Giver was hoe they were similar.It taught me how lucky I am to be capable of making my own decisions. I think their world was too complicated to understand sometimes... Other than some of those things I would say The Giver was a pretty interesting book...."
4,My Book Crituque,"Lois Lowry's book, The Giver, was a really good book. I really liked the way she described the ""Community."" I also liked the way she put everything in order. She didn't skip around from in the middle of one of Jonas' sessions with the Giver to school the next day. I thought the ending could've been much better though. She left us on the edge of our seats when she ended the book. She never told us how Jonas liked Elsewhere or if he and Gabe even made it to Elsewhere. THERE NEEDS TO BE A SEQUAL! Overall I think the book was really good. If Lois would've added all the parts she left out including the ending, the start of life in Elsewhere for Jonas and Gabe, how the community reacted to all the memories, what Lily's assignment was, and if Asher and Fiona were put together in a family unit, it would've been that much better! 7.3 jrm"
3,The Giver,"I thought this book was very interesting, but it did not grab my attention like most other books I have read. Some of it was confusing, but in the end everything finally came. The concept of the book was great, but it could of been better if it was more elaborate. I think that you should read this if you want a good book on a rainy day! =)"
3,amusing,"I find the book OK: The book is written in an understandable language. The topik of the book is interessting. But I dislike the open-end, because some questions aren't still answered.I like the book and I think it is very interesting. If you know the content it is very simple to understand. I didn't like the open-end.It is a actuell novel which is written in a easy way."
5,A touching Novel Full of Thought Provoking Wizdom,"What a touching book. It shows the ultamite value of the human spirit, even in the face of danger. This book is the most touching book i have ever read, and may it's message live in the hearts of all."
4,THe giver was awesome,"When i read the book The Giver it made me think about different thing. For instance, how would i feel about living in a utopia?, what would i do if didn't live with my bilogical parents?, and How would i feel if i didn't have the ability to love anyone? As i read this book all theses things went though my mind. And after i was done reading it i finally was able to answer them. And my answer was simple:i feel as though i was trap and couldn't get out. And for what i would do i would eventually run away, just like jonas. I really liked this book, especially the ending. But even the ending made you wonder if they were going to make to Elsewhere or not. And that is , in my opinion, the perfect way to end a book, to have your readers wanting to know more. So that they want to be able to buy and read the sequel. And that is exactly how felt after i read the end. If had to rate the book it would get 4 stars.Alberta Smith,13"
3,Communism to the extreme,"In my opinion, ""The Giver"" was an excellent book. It dealt with a future that is both frightening in its reality and illuminating in the way their society is run. Dealing with the story of a growing boy who is about to face his life's job for the first time, Jonas is chosen for the most respected job. He is the Receiver of Memories, who remembers everything of the history of the race so that the general public doesn't have to. They live in a world without color, emotion, or choice of any kind - they are even given pills to prevent sexual urges. Lois Lowry combines the idea of communism to the extreme with the idea that even a twelve-year-old child can change society if he so chooses in a story that makes you appreciate how horrible a life like that could be in comparison to all of the choices we make today."
4,Individuality and freedom.,"The first time I read this book I was in fourth grade, and most of of its meaning was lost on me. I have reread this book and a lot of connections were made that I simply was not mature enough to see before. At the ripe old age of nine, I simply did not understand the ideas of freedom and the ability to make choices. Now at 18, I see many of the ideas that went through Jonas' mind paralleled my own as I matured. The sense of individuality and freedom, which I now take for granted, were completely removed from the society Jonas was raised in, yet he found the ideas buried within him. It shows that the breaking away of a maturing child is archetypal in nature. And that, i believe, is the fundamental basis of this novel."
5,Great Book!!,"I am about 13 years old and i loved this book. At first it was confusing but it got really good after the first part. This is probaly 1 of the best books i have ever read so far! Anybody who says this book is stupid has'nt read the book. Read this book, it wont be a waste of your time. I guarentee it."
3,The Battle Against Conformity,"When I first read this book, I wasn't too impressed. It seemed to me that it was another story of pure imagination and little reason if any.After a while, I started to realize the message that Lois Lowry was trying to convey. She was stating the dangers of pure conformity and tradition. They had left individuality, and even justice, to distort it to fit their conformist beliefs.In that society's beliefs, killing the old or handicapped was not only normal, but right. Only the Giver understood the pain of loss, the value of human life and individuality, and everything that had been left behind by society.The Giver contained a lot of imagination, but now that I look back on it, I see the reasoning."
4,"Hook, line and then sunk!","My 13 year old Godson read The Giver and he was so interested, I decided to read it too. It took about an hour, it was so compelling. However, the ending really disappointed me!! WAAAAY too many unanswered questions! I am not talking about tidy resolutions, but it seems like the author got tired, and just stopped!!I teach lit, and also read avidly, so have a lot to compare it to.Do read it, though. It's worth it."
5,To Williams,"The Giver was an extrordinary book that opened up my imagination, and even though I had to read it for language arts I'm glad I did. All through this book I discovered things as if I was Jonas trying to piece things togther. It was written well with depth and understanding. It isn't just a book about a boy in a strange society; It's a book connecting to our daily lives and controversies happening right now. This is a very good book!"
4,The Giver is Good,"The Giver I thought was a very good book. It provides us with a glimpse of the good and bad of a utopian society. I would suggest to everyone that you read this book. At first you may not be interested, but it only gets better along the way. The Giver opens up your eyes, and you begin to feel for the main character Jonas, as well as the Giver. You will also begin to have your own feelings about the society Jonas lives in and being released. Therefore, the Giver is an exciting book that everyone will enjoy!"
4,The Giver,The Giver is a great book. It's not too hard material but it's a little complicated. I would suggest that kids 9-14 should read it. It's a good book for any project since it's very unique.
4,The Giver,"I would not say it was the worst book I have ever read about a utopia,but it wasn't the best either. The idea of a place where there is no pain is good; alot of fiction books use that idea. There's something wrong and Jonas the leadcharacter breaks most of the rules to get a child out of the colony while the government usesall its resources to get him back. He escapes from the only end in that place: death.The ending, I think, doesn't make sense. Lois Lowry just chose an easyway to end it. Even so, it is a classic and I rate it 4 stars."
3,"Great body, Disturbing Ending","I really liked the book's body. I thought wow, this is a great book! Then when I found out how people were released, it socked me. I didn't expect that was the way they released people. I thought they just outcast people, not exicute them. But overall it was an o.k."
4,A Kids Review For The Giver,"If you like strange books. Then this is the perfect book for you. I liked The Giver, But it was strange. Instead of normal families there are family unit. When you are born you are basically given to a family. And on your twelth Christmas you are given a job. Jonas one of the charators is given a job called the giver. He will have someone who has know everything in this world passed down to him. Read to find out the rest."
3,The Great Minds,"The Giver is about a boy named Jonas and he lives in a community where other people pick there jobs and wife's/husbands and clothes. Jonas job is the Giver and a Giver helps people and the community. A Giver also has special powers and great minds.I would recommend this book because it's very interesting and it kind of pulls you in to read and read longer. This book is also kind of sad because people die. Not only is this book interesting and sad, but sometimes in the book something pops up and it's always surprising or important."
3,The Giver,"Have you ever thought about what our world will be like in the future? If you said yes then The Giver by Lois Lowery is a great book for you. The main character, Jonas lives in a Utopia and they assign jobs to all the people. He has been given the job of Receiver of Memories, so he gets all the memories from the past. This makes him very unhappy and even the old Giver can not help him cope. This leads Jonas to have to make a very difficult decision between his friends and family and what he is destined to do. This is a science fiction novel that is written in Jonas's view. This book is very slow moving. I did not like this about this book. I also didn't like how the ending left you hanging, so you would have to read the second book of the series, Gathering Blue. The writer's style is very boring and reuses the same words many times over. Although I am not ecstatic about the book, it really does make you think abbot the future and the some of the things that could be in store for us then!"
4,Glad I read it,"Glad I finally picked this up to read after seeing a great review for the fourth book, The Son, in this series. Figured I'd start with the first to see how it was. Great book. Moves quickly, characters well developed, and interesting dystopian plot. I think it's a good book for all ages. It's also a commentary on society without being preachy. I've since read the second in the series's and look forward to the next two as well."
5,the Fantasy of living the life,The giver was a fantastic book. I encourage all ages to read it. I think that high schools should allow this kind of book to be read in schools. This book really touches peoples lives when they are having a rough life. This book can really get your imagination thriving to make an imangary life that can help people theough the rough times in life.
5,Fantastic read,"How have I not read The Giver before now? It is a great book for children and adults alike. If you enjoy a read that paints another world so clearly that you feel like you are there, and gets you comparing it to the world you live in, then this book is for you. It is quite thought-provoking."
3,"My personal review of ""The Giver""","""The Giver"" deals with information about the twelve year old boy Jonas who lives in a future society. In my opinion the book wasn't as exciting as other books i read. Although the story was very fascinating and interesting in the second part, the first part of the book is written very boring. Nothing interesting happens there. When the ceremony is over and Jonas starts his training and receives the memories, ""The Giver"" becomes more and more fascinating. So coming to a conclusion I would say that it's a average written book with a well thought story"
2,this book is prety weird,I dident really like it becuse it was really weird. And it was nothing like you think it whould be. And the reson i give it a 2star is becuse i like exsiting books and it isent really exciting. but if you like books that are not what you think this is one for you. Well keep on redading. you might like it and if you do put a recamandation on hear about it. :0) :>)
3,The Giver - for children or adults?,"""The Giver"" deals with a very strange world where people have to follow a lot of rules to build a painless society! I can't decide if this novel is mainly written for children or adults. I suppose, it's very interesting to compare our today's world with the Givers's society but the story is a little bit boring. I think, the philosophical aspects (e.g. talking about love) are mainly adults' topics while the story is written in such a simple style that even young children may understand and that doesn't really satisfy me. Coming to conclusion, ""The Giver"" has a lot of interesting aspects of social and philosophical topics but the story is too simple to be exciting."
5,Fantastic Book!,"I loved this book! It kept me hooked for hours! Once I picked this book up I could not put it down. This book is fascinating with its different point of view and completely surreal content with its mixture of light and darkness with color. This story is in a black and white setting with one boy that is given images of color and memories. There are different twists and turns that surprised me and some parts made me upset, but I could not put this book down! I had to see how the book ended and how it all worked out. I highly recommend this book to people who want to read a strange but great book. I loved it!"
3,Interesting,"""The life where nothing was ever unexpected. Or inconvenient. Or unusual. The life without color, pain, or past.""The author gives a view into a differnt world and how a young boy feels once he knows the truth.There are some interesting ideas presented in this book. I found many to be thought provoking and I had to imagine what it would be like if my world were to be so,radically different.The young boy is very likeable. His bravery is inspirational. But I wasn't interested enough to continue the series."
3,Disappointing,No ending. It was a great big tease with lots of promise in the build-up and then (spoiler alert) literally no ending. This book is engaging with similar tones as the Hunger Games and 1984 just without the big finish.
2,Not my kind of story,"I did not care for this book, it reminded me of the strange story of The Hunger Games. I prefer books that are more realistic."
3,the giver,"Lately, I've been reading best sellers from the past and that's why I read ""The Giver"". I wasn't crazy about it. It left out too many details (didn't explain how it all came to be, for example). I'm finding that just because books make the best seller list, doesn't mean they're very good."
3,Brave new world for kids,A watered down version of Huxley's Brave New World about a dystopian society. Written from a 12 year old perspective so young teenagers can relate to it. (Spoiler) I enjoyed the non-closure ending.
4,Great book & its one of my favorite,"It was a really exciting and fun book, i enjoyed it very much but i just wish that Louis Lowry would have told us what happened when he got down the hill and what happened to him and the baby."
5,Amazing Cd!,This cd is one of my favorites that I have ever bought. I saw Melee in concert last night and they rocked it! I also got to meet the guys afterward and they are awesome down-to-earth guys that were so happy to sign my cd. Great group of guys that produce some amazing music. Check this cd out!
4,Pretty Close to Real,"When used in a salad or recipe, you could probably fool some meat eaters with this. I have not been a vegetarian very long, so I do remember what chicken tastes like. The broth from the can is also good. I have used that in soups & such when I was using the Diced Chik for other things."
3,Ever Increasing Price?,"I actually purchased this in April for $33.18 per case and I came back to purchase another case and the price is now over $54 on Subscribe and Save? I am confused as to why the price would increase so dramatically over the course of 3 months. I can actually go purchase this cheaper in my local grocery store since this huge price increase, so I cancelled my Subscription here on Amazon."
3,Consistency of chicken but not the taste,TVP has the consistency of meat but has an alien taste. I knew this before I purchased this item but I bought it anyway because it's high in protien and fat free. Whoever said the broth tastes good is obviously a vegeterian who has forgotten what real chicken tastes like.I've used this in various soups and in moderation it's tolerable. I wouldn't serve this to anybody unless I asked them first. TVP is a highly processed product which is far from natural. I'm only eating this to loose a few pounds while dieting. I wouldn't consider making this part of my regular menu.
3,Not my favorite meatless meat...,"Actually, I generally really like meat substitutes, but I found that this particular product fell flat with me. Although the texture was nice and chewy, there was a canned flavor that I just couldn't get past... the smell was akin to lower-quality canned meat (remember Vienna sausages or deviled ham?). I had to rinse the ""chik"" off to get rid of the thick-ish brine in which it was packed, which made it marginally better. There are other canned products that I like, such as Cedar Lakes hot dogs and the ""tuno"" that Worthington used to make, so it's not about being canned. I do regret buying an entire case. My suggestion is to buy one can to try it, then go on to buying by the case if it's up your alley."
5,Diced chic,"I agree with Ms Brown, this is a great product to use in place of tuna or poltery. It tastes great and is healhty for you."
3,It is just a thesaurus,"First of all, I am not a writer so I am sure I missed the main point of this book. I bought the book to help with an American Sign Language (ASL) class I was taking. Since ASL does not have a sign for every word, it was suggested that I use this book to find a synonym for the word which may have an ASL sign. For my purposes, I think I could have used a regular thesaurus. There is a big upside to me buying this book...it helped me to expand my vocabulary."
1,Bill from Illinois,"This book is so full of grammatical and typographical errors, it is virtually unreadable. I read through about half the book and gave up. There are an average of 5 errors per page - that's over 1000 errors in a 200 page book! I want my money back. The author and publisher should be ashamed to have offered this book to the public."
2,"Not the worst ever, but a runner up","I couldn't resist. Alpha Video sells a T-shirt with the cover art on the front. Turns out that's just about the best part. Newlyweds return home to the creepy empty mansion driving a gull-wing mercedes (one of the highpoints of this movie). Very subtle foreshadowing on his lack of funds. Creepy pastor and his wife show up and fawn all over the new wife. Dead first wife in the pond. Creepy portrait, creepy gardener...the wife is bingo from her parent's accident and she reads Henry James to put herself to sleep. She gonna die!! Effective scary point in the middle, laughable ""Bride of the Monster"" quality special effect of the skull attacking the husband...in the pond even! Only 68 minutes long so it will serve as a great Halloween movie for my attention-span impared children. Other than that...buy the T-shirt and SAY that you saw the movie."
5,true horror,"Every once in awhile, one will come across a gem. Well, this is one of them. this movie ranked up there with such greats as ""house on haunted hill"" (Vincent Price), and ""The Haunting"".Truly what makes this movie horror is the fact that it doesn't have the blood and gore that seems to make a horror film today. No, instead it makes YOU rely upon your senses.I very highly recommend this gem to anyone who wants to see psychological terror and escape the blood and gore."
1,Not as advertised.,"Warning: This movie is NOT a color (colorized) version of the original black & white movie like the ad states. It is just the black & white movie. The DVD case even says (in the small print on the back) that it is black & white.I do not believe this is Amazon's fault. The listing is by a company called CV Trading. They would have been who said the movie was in color.My son, who wanted this, was very disappointed."
4,Creepy Yet Not Terrifying,"I really like the packaging of the movies together, with trailers for both movies and an intermission cartoon (Betty Boop) in the middle, all accessible individually through the interactive menu. That being said, neither movie is 'believably frightening' if you are older than 10. The Screaming Skull was fairly suspenseful, but the effects are very dated. The Werewolf vs. Vampire Woman is eerie, the women are very attractive and Paul Naschy has the werewolf bit nailed down. This is a good double-feature collection to keep around for a dull weekend."
2,Not much to miss here...,"I'm usually a big 50's sci fi buff so how could I resist such a great title and cover art, right?It was a decent story and well done but there really wasn't much to it. Nothing really creative as far as scares or special effects - just the same plastic skull rolling around on the floor over and over. It probably would have played better as a 1/2 hour episode of Night Gallery. For reference purposes on 50's horror, I prefer House on Haunted Hill or Tingler to this film. Screaming Skull is not bad, just uneventful with a lack of real scares or creativity.One thing to note on the Good Times version - it has a decent transfer, the sound has a hiss and crackle and there is a GoodTimes 'GT' logo that stays in the bottom corner of the screen the entire picture. I guess GoodTimes will always be lame."
3,Skull-duggery,"Eric and Jenny (John Hudson and Peggy Webber) are newlyweds who move into the country mansion that Eric lived in with his first wife, Mary. Mary met with an untimely demise by ""slipping"" and smashing her skull on the pond wall. Now, Jenny is experiencing late-night visitations by Mary's ghost. Or is she? Eric seems supportive, but just might be gaslighting his new bride. Mickey, the gardener, grew up with Mary and could be crazy enough to terrorize Jenny. Yes, the skull rolls around like a boney soccer ball. There are some periods of dullness, but the whole thing is just over an hour long. Worth a look..."
3,SCREAMING SKULL.......eh.,"Eh. The Screaming Skull was included in the 50 movie, 12 DVD horror collection I just purchased. I found the movie slow, but there are some nice touches....the peacocks on the estate and the strange sound they make at night, the way the skull lands and rolls on the garden lawn when the women hurls it from her window. That's about it.Oh yeah,that ultimate creepy music from the opening of Kubrick's The Shining is featured in the beginning. I found that interesting."
1,"Ignore the Other Reviews, This is Awful","Ignore some of the folks who gave this five stars. Both the movies and the picture are absolutely horrendous (but you expected that, didn't you.) ""Screaming Skull"" and especially ""Werewolf vs. Vampire Woman"" aren't as deliriously so-bad-they're-good as you'd hope: they're just bad. As in BAD bad.""Screaming Skull"" and especially ""Werewolf vs. Vampire Woman"" look awful. ""Werewolf"" includes some of the strangest visual distortion I've ever seen: the backgrounds tend to jitter as the foregrounds stay still. Colour bleed, grain, and poor contrast are all present.The extras include a not very good Betty Boop cartoon, as well as trailers for the main attractions and ""Brides of Dracula."" The trailers are the disc's only asset."
1,Do not waste your money!,"This movie is a let down all the way around. I am a huge fan of old horror movies, but I cannot find one good thing to say about this one. The print I attained on DVD is horrible. The picture is choppy, out of frame, shows it's age, and the sound is muffled and very low. As to the content, the movie drags all the way through, the effects were very poor, and the acting was worse than plan 9 from outer space. I thought they could have done much more with the plot, but chose a cheap route, even for 1958. To me, it isn't even worth watching for laughs. Should be a dollar store special, but even they have better movies!"
1,Screaming mad at this junk.,"First off, this product is something someone made at their house. They burned a copy of the flick, slapped on a cheap-jack label, and made the cover on their printer. That in itself wouldn't matter to me if the movie was in pristine shape and looked sharp. Here's the thing, I tried to play the disk in 3 different NTSC DVD players and none of them will read it. My HD DVD player gave me the error that the disk wasn't in DVD format. Nice hu? And it's only $15. Ummm No thanks"
3,Will the real Screaming Skull please stand up?,"I am not writing this to review the Goodtimes release of THE SCREAMING SKULL (1958). The film is a guilty pleasure of mine, but that is another story.Rather, I would like to clarify that, contrary to the credits listed on Amazon, David McCallum is not in this movie. The error is derived from the fact David McCallum, Carrie Nye and Vincent Gardenia were in a 1973 ABC WIDE WORLD OF ENTERTAINMENT movie (actually on videotape) of the same title. This SCREAMING SKULL was directed by Gloria Monty. It isn't a remake of the 1958 film, but has a more legitimate parentage, based on a famous ghost story by F. Marion Crawford. It likewise suffers from a low budget, but I would love to see it again. No commercial release for it, but there are bootlegs to be found for the curious.Just wanted to spare David McCallum fans the disappointment of buying the wrong film."
2,terrible l video transfer,"The synergy DVD looks like it was shot directly from a projector showing, e.g like a VERY bad VSH tapeToo bad, the creepy film can be quite effective and deserves much betterRating is for product quality only"
2,People are sulking about,"This film is not worth the storage room. Everything is as transparent as her night attire. And the film makes no attempt to convolute what little plot there is.Eric Whitlock's (John Hudson) first wife dies and only leaves him the house. His second wife, Jenni (Peggy Webber) is a bit richer. Unfortunately she is still alive; but not for long. You see Jenni is unstable and keeps seeing skulls. They like to scream at her. Now I wonder where the skulls are coming from.The Brain That Wouldn't Die"
3,OK FOR FANS OF THE GENRE 2 1/2 STARS!,"I'm a fan of these old horror films and I can usually find some good points in almost any of them. 'The Screaming Skull' has some atmosphere and a few mild scares, but the low budget and poor acting keep this one from rising above mediocrity. I'm not sure how the print looks on this edition as all of the prints I've seen are pretty battered. Does anyone know of a really good print available?"
2,Get the Goodtimes DVD of this title,"Having seen the absolutely awful Alpha transfer of this movie, I was very happy to find that the Goodtimes DVD is far superior. Certainly it isn't a perfect copy but the picture quality and the sound are much better than the Alpha version. Although there is a GT in the lower right hand corner of the screen throughout, at least you can see and hear this DVD of The Screaming Skull. You certainly can't say the same for the Alpha DVD. The meager two stars is because it isn't really a very good movie no matter what the quality of the DVD."
3,Screaming Skull DVD,"I saw this movie years ago back in the mid 60's as a kid on a Saturday morning. I really liked the movie, but quality of this film print on dvd wasn't much to be desired. It looked faded out and was hard to see any definition in this film print at times. If there is a better film print of this please let me know."
1,Screaming Skull,"It's an old movie; however, I would have like it if the sound could actually be heard. However, for a 1950's movie for $7.00 what do you expect?"
5,The Isaacs are a phenomenon.,"We've all heard about ""family"" harmonies and how tight they can be. The Isaacs prove the theory again and again. Whenever they appear on The Gaithers television shows, I set the dvr just to play back their songs. It's good to be able to have this one to play in the car as well."
1,Fluffy rehash of the same old stuff,"If Bruce Schneier has acquired a habit, it is the ability to take the same old material and rehash it into different books, year after year. My guess is that, next year, he'll use another slightly different angle and try to sell you the same basic information.What I find truly onerous about his books is the condescending tone that Schneier adopts when addressing the reader.Recently I spoke with a PhD, from Brown, who performed decades of research in number theory. He recommended ""Cryptography in C and C++,"" by Michael Welschenbach. He also said ""I don't know why people think Applied Cryptography is such a good book. He [Schneier] doesn't seem to understand the mathematics very well."" Pick up Applied Cryptography sometime and compare it side-by-side with Welschenbach's book. You'll see what that PhD was talking about."
4,Lots of very useful practical advice &#65533; and don't panic,"Not quite what I'd expected. I'd read & enjoyed 'Secrets & Lies', and I thought this would be more of the same. This book is really a discussion about what actions have been taken post 9/11, and in parts it's a criticism of the overreaction that there has been.However, its not overtly political, and gives dozens (perhaps a 100) practical worked examples of good & bad, effective & ineffective, responses to security issues, whether it be physical, electronic etc.There is a 5-step process which I found useful to apply to everyday situations; and (in highly abbreviated form) these are : what are you trying to protect; what are the risks; risk mitigation; risks caused by the solution; trade-offsThe core message is : ""as both individuals and a society, we can make choices about our security"", and this book helps you understand how to make those informed decisions."
5,A fine read. Recommended.,Schneier gives the reader a healthy and mostly dispassionate view on what commonsense security measures ought to be. He has done plenty of research and is an authority in the field for a good reason. It is too bad much of his advice is still unheeded. Security is indeed all about tradeoffs and the author does a great job presenting a discussion and many useful examples. Recommended. Also check out his Web site for the latest on the developments in the field.
1,Not worth reading,"I'm a computer scientist and this book didn't teach me anything. I do not recommend this book to anyone, there is nothing you will learn from it. Save your money or spend it for a better book!"
5,Finally! An intelligent treatment of security!,"Too many books on security provide ""how to"" information (buy this, install that), with no regard to what is being protected and from what. ""Beyond Fear"" doesn't talk about what to buy to ""feel"" safe, but about how to analyze threats, risks, and the actions one might take to deal with them in an intelligent and interesting read. His insights into anti-terrorism efforts are enlightening."
5,Clear thinking in troubling times,Mr. Schneier's conversational tones and clear examples help bring to light the best ways to consider the security issues we must face each day. It is rare when a book is as entertaining as it is useful. This is such a book.
5,The Theory and Practice of Security,"After discussing various security problems and proposed solutions, this book gives examples of how those methods have worked in the real world. Or how and why they failed to achieve the desired result.Informative and entertaining."
4,Buy This Low-Priced Set Before It Disappears!,"This is a wonderful little British CD that is no longer being manufactured.The set takes the Hank Williams locals from his HEALTH AND HAPPINESS SHOWS, utilizes noise reduction, and the results are startingly modern-sounding. Anyone who collects Hank's music needs these songs. Of course, they are available on several other low-priced sets, including THE PRODIGAL SON.Or, buy the HEALTH AND HAPPINESS SHOWS for $100, with their locals of Hank's wife and scratchy sound quality."
4,Time Travel that makes sense,"I remember going to see this at the dollar theater and not expecting much of it. I loved it. So, if you set your expectations low enough you will be set to enjoy this movie.The absolute cluelessness of the characters lets you put your brain in neutral and let it idle a bit.However, the one thing that I found really unique about this film was that Hollywood did time travel right for a change, as opposed to all of the paradoxical situations that it has produced in the past (Back to the Future etc) Not that those films were bad, but it wasn't so much time travel as semi-controled sliding between alternate universes...Bill and Ted. 1 time line, No paradoxes, and a time-traveling phone booth (think TARDIS but not as cool) -- just good plain fun...."
5,Perhaps the Greatest Movie Ever (Filmed in San Dimas),"Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure is one of the funniest movies that we got out of the 80s, although that might not be saying much. The plot is creative and original, but you can't expect full on reality because thats not what the movie is about. Keanu Reeves is extremely funny and so is Alex Winter. Some say that Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey is better, but the original is definately the better of the two."
3,Alright but funny movie.,"As a huge Keanu fan. I will say that this movie is worth watching, but its not the best. It is full of comedy."
4,Intelligent Time Travel,"Excellent Adventure is one of the best time travel movies ever made. It falls into the category of predestination paradox, in which travelling through time changes nothing, since one's participation in past events was part of the original ""way things were supposed to happen."" This is by far the most logical time travel paradigm; as those who wondered about the Marty McFly paradox at the end of the first Back to the Future (when Marty returns back to the night he left and sees himself, isn't that an alternate version thereof, who grew up with rich and successful parents?) might agree. What makes Excellent Adventure great is the flourish with which the film revels in this paradigm. Bill and Ted meet themselves, twice. The eleventh hour, saved, by the deus ex machina of the protagonist's own off-screen intervention from some point in the future. Grand stuff."
2,silly,"History characters were fun.Good concept.Gotta love Keanu, but the acting was horrible.Movie was better in the 80's."
4,Blast from the past,"This is a classic 1980's video. It was great when it came out, and it stands the test of time today. If you want a throwback to some 80's nostalgia, watch this film!"
4,"Good Movie, subpar DVD","I have always loved this movie. Cheesy 80s Guitar, Keanu at his seemingly best and worst all with a fun plot. It still is great fun to watch today, and it definately brings back major memories of the 80s. The DVD has a decent picture and good sound but its lacking in any kind of special features whatsoever. I would still reccomend getting it though, its worth it."
3,It's gotten old.,"I loved this movie when it first came out. It was good to reconnect with the ""dudes"" but the film hasn't survived over the years. Too bad."
4,Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure (1989),"This movie is so #$*^ing stupid that it's good. Although the film is drenched in cliches, predictable, and has a lot of stereo typed characters, the film still offers a very comical experience. The film is a laugh out loud riot, so you can't help but enjoy this film. You'll be laughing when Ted's little brother ditches Napoleon at the Bowling Alley, or when the other historical figures are running around the mall. Overall, if you want a comedy that doesn't require a lot of thought, then look no further than this one. I highly recommend it."
4,Funny yet extremely stupid,"I admit that this movie is funny, yet it is not funny enough to want to watch it again and again. The movie loses its edge after you get over the initial shock of Keanu Reeves playing such a dorky character. Yet, I do believe that this is a movie that everone should see at least once. You should defiantly watch it to see Keanu Reeves at his dorky hair stage."
4,80s Comedy at some of its finest,"So why not 5 stars? Well, that's hard to explain. While the movie is a hoot with Bill and Ted racing to get the A they need on their final project in History to keep Ted out of military school in Alaska. Even the plot itself has low-budget written all over it. But, it is suprisingly good. Very good. Most movies like this really do not hold up well under time, this holds up well after over 12 years, which is quite an accomplishment. Most movies lose it after 4 or 5 years. But, this is meant to be a fun movie, and does not let you down.Not in league with some of the great movies of all time, it wasn't meant to be either. 4 solid stars."
4,Keanu's Best Work,"Let's face it, the guy was made to do films like this. This movie is what a film should be. Just pure entertainment, no heavy plots, no complex story lines."
3,"Dude, get off of drugs","This movie is, well, interesting. Bill and Ted are two kids who have a dream of starting their own band, but they don't have good instruments and they can't play. They have to pass this history presentation or the flunk and Ted has to go to Military camp. They get help from a gu from the future and go back in time and grab several characters from history for their project. The storyline is one of the worst. The way the two guys talk, we'll just say the should back off of the narcotics. ..."
2,Dated...,"This film was recommended by a fellow teacher for an end of the year reward for my students. Some of them enjoyed it, but I will never watch it again. The dialogue is dated and painful to listen to...I know it is a parody of the times, but I can't imagine ever finding this film enjoyable. Another teacher did...she enjoys watching it. I truly am surprised she recommended it.I love George Carlin...he was a redeeming feature for me."
5,Excellent,"What can I say about Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure? Oh yeah, it's excellent! It's a funny movie that anyone can enjoy watching, which is something that's so hard to find these days."

5,Most Excellent!,"Bill and Ted are two defunct high schoolers who have been stuck with a horrendous history assignment (I never knew Joan of Arc was Noah's wife!). With a little bit of help from the future they travel back in time, picking up famous historical characters on the way (Miss of Arc, Mister the Kid). I think my favorite part was when Bill and Ted were in the old West, when Ted says, ""Dude they didn't even card us! We got to remember this place."" Or maybe it was when they met So Crates (in their book under Socrates). A classic in my book."
5,I love this movie I just watched it recently it KICKS ASS,"I'm 16/m from Sydney in Australia I love this movie it's so cool it's a movie for everyone it's got a bit of everything I saw this movie over 75343 times and i will not stop until I die, maybe I sound crazy saying this but this is simply a classic movie and should go in the Classic movies Hall of fame! IF you like this movie please message me and we'll chat"
4,Most Excellent...IN a Weird sort of way....,"I have no idea why I am reviewing this item...perhaps because my brother is doing his weird impersonations again. At any rate I'll make this quick.Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure is a bizarre, yet hilarious account of two boys trying to finish their history presentation at the last minute. WIth the help of a friend from the future and a telephone booth that transports people through time, their about to collect as many historical figures as possible and give a totally bodacious presentation. Yeah!This movie is rather silly ... kind of like Napolean Dynamite, but leaves a lasting impression. It seems to me to be original and was definitely worth the laughs it gave. I wouldn't buy it, but it's certainly worth watching!"
5,A Most Excellent Movie!,"Whoa! My father introduced me to the excellent world of The Great Ones last night. It totally ROCKED. I thought Napoleon in Waterloo was hysterical! Also I loved when BEETHOVEN not Mozart had a jam session in the mall. Remember, Be Excellent To Each Other, and PARTY ON DUDES! PS- If anyone knows where to get one of those phone booths, contact me please! :o)"
4,A quintessential 80's movie,"Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure is one of the defining movies of the 80's, or of how I remember them, since i was a young child. It belongs with other great 80's movies like Back to the Future, another one about time travel, Mannequin, Gremlins, and many others. It makes learning history seem almost cool and interesting, with great characters like Napoleon (who is the best one), Socrates, Lincoln, Billy the Kid, Genghis Khan (another funny one), Joan of Arc, and some others. They travel back in time to bring these characters back to present for a history report to save their grade in school. As they would say: ""No way."" ""Yes way!"" and bodacious!"
4,A Most Excellent Adventure,"I admit, I almost gave it five stars because of my childhood memories, but let's face it, not the greatest movie ever made. Possibly the best Keanu movie ever made (well, i did like the matrix . . . ). anyhow, the fact of the matter is that is it like, totally the 80's at it's most bodacious! The movie is hilarious, has a fun and light take on history's notable people. Not a serious film, wasn't supposed to be. It's just plain fun and good for a good laugh."
3,Fun movie but the DVD could be better.,"I really enjoy this movie, but the 3 stars are for what the DVD has to offer. All you can do is set captions, watch the trailor and the movie. That's all? Overall this is a great movie... just for kicks of course!"
2,Good 80's flick on bad DVD,"For those who survived the 80's, some -like me- will have a particular fondness for this film. Sure it's dumb, put parts are funny and overall was an enjoyable film to kill some time. Unfortunately it's transition to DVD format is quite mediocre. A little better than lousy transfer has specks and spots all over the movie, and the only extra provided is a trailer. Buy only if you seriously miss this movie."
1,great movie another defective dvd,"I hope this is just me and my dvd player its a panasonic a150 the same players that many people had trouble with reading dinosaur and scary movie and the kid, those all played fine for me, but this disc does not and it is the second one I tried, so this is a waraning to all people out there make sure there are no problems with certain dvds and players before you buy them. The movie is one of my all time favorites and now i cant watch it and am out ten bucks will atlast its not twenty."
1,for air heads only,"It's the one and only time that I nearly got up and left the theatre - and my ticket was free!! I found it stupid and moronic. How many times can a person hear ""dude"" in one movie? It shows a skewed view of history, and unfortunately could screw up someone who doesn't know the whole story.... like the first reviewer on this movie."
1,Radical in all the wrong ways - snapshot of modern America.,"Friends of mine I respect adore this film, so I guess I should judge it on its own terms. It certainly captures a moment in post-modernity when history became a flat nothing, reduced to propaganda for the great project of American amnesia. I'd like to think the whole thing was sarcastic, never mind subversive. I wouldn't mind, but they get a relatively good idea and do nothing with it. You've got all these famous people from history, and you don't try to see how they'd spark off each other, or how they'd genuninely react to 'our' world. I suppose there is something subversive about taking self-important Great Men (and token woman who dressed like man) and making them ridiculous, but that would be satire, and this settles for sniggering. The inane script, thumpable acting and non-existent visual style are meant to be endearing. I guess I'm old-fashioned - it made me feel violent."
3,Who says the 80s were a waste...?,"This film, while definitely not life-changing, was one of the best films of the 80s. I remember seeing this in the theater when it came to my small, home-town. It was great. The DVD left much to be desired, but I guess it would be hard to get Keanu Reeves to comment on the film that made him out to be a colossal dufus, especially after the success (and ego-boost) of the Matrix. But it is still a solid piece of my DVD library. If you're a fan of the movie, definitely buy it. If you've never seen it, check it out ASAP!"
3,Frankenstein got competition,"Typical Italian horror movie of the beginning of the 70's with a Hammer House horror look. The Two main actors are known for the time, which give a little more credit on the movie. Compare to violence in today's movies, I would say it is rated R because of the small naked scenes. I liked the movie."
2,Wacky Italian Take on the Frankenstein Legend,"Fresh out of medical school and eager to prove her abilities as a ""surgeon,"" Dr. Frankenstein's daughter (Rosalba Neri) sets out to build her own monster-to kill the one created by her late father, which is now running amok terrorizing the locals. As if that weren't goofy enough, she decides to construct her monster using the brain of her father's assistant (whom she's just married) and the body of the hunky village idiot. It's a movie that could only be made in Italy and only in the '70s. Recommended for Euro-horror fanatics only.The picture and sound quality on this DVD could be better, but I've definitely seen worse on bargain-priced DVDs like this. The print that was used is scratchy at times, but the colors are still fairly vibrant and sound is generally quite good. All in all, this DVD is a pretty good buy at this price.Two out of five stars."
2,Whattya want? Good acting??,"Before you even hit ""play,"" you know you're getting schlock, but this is good schlock. It's a variation on the basic Frank theme, but with a few little twists. Joseph Cotten looks completely embarassed most of the time, while Hartigay (Jayne Mansfield's ex) just looks happy to be working. Bay/Neri is actually quite fetching. She's also an abysmal actor, as is the fellow who plays Marshall. As are, in fact, pretty much everyone in the movie. There are some interesting lab scenes, some nudity, a goofy-looking monster, a few double entendres, bad FX, lotsa murders and a seriously abrupt ending. For this price, you just can't go wrong."
3,Cinema junk,"Another bad DVD double feature featuring two movies that are better off not seen. Joseph Cotton is billed as ""James"" Cotton on the case. (?) DVD Drive-In is releasing the official Lady Frankenstein DVD soon so if you want this flick, wait for that remastered version."
4,italien hammer variation,"in germany this movie is out of stock for long years, so I had only a bootleg in very bad quality to watch it. but even in this way I think it is a very entertaining horror movie. the critics in germany hated or ignored it but I think it comes very close to the best hammer horror movies of the 70s. there is very good acting, in particular paul muller as frankensteins poor assistant charles, rosanna alby as the wicked lady and our german actor herbert fuchs who gives an over the top performance as the leacherous bodysnatcher lynch. greetings from germany and merry christmas"
3,Lady Frankenstein (1971),"basically this is a re-telling of the classic Frankenstein story. Joseph (""Citizen Kane"") Cotton plays Dr. Frankenstein.The new wrinkle in the story involves his daughter, who is also a doctor and wants to follow in her father's footsteps, in regard to conducting experiments on dead tissue.Joseph Cotton alone makes this worth watching and the actress playing his daughter provides the eye-candy.* recommended for horror fans *"
4,McCorkle always a pleasure,"Crash Diet reveals McCorkle's strengths as a writer of the New South, which I first enjoyed several years ago in July 7th and Tending to Virginia. It's like I was never gone; her comic style intertwines effortlessly with the truly sympathetic in this collection of short fiction. There are lots of voices here, all of women grappling with changes in their lives that have brought chaos, rather than order. The pieces were written across a span of years and the author's propensity to drop topical references to our disposable culture can be a little distracting when moving from one story to another, as you inevitably pause to recall just when ""Falcon Crest"" or ""The New Newlyweds Game"" was hot. But that's just a little itch, and it doesn't date the material."
4,A wonderful Book of Short Stories about women,"I usually don't read short stories, but I read a review of this book and decided to take a chance. I'm glad I did. Ms. McCorkle does a wonderful job of portraying various types of women. It is perfect bedside reading."
5,Great gift to share with my new nephew,"I have always been a Dr. Seuss fan since I was a small child. I thought this would be a great way to introduce my new nephew to these wonderful stories. Merry Christmas, P. Paules"
5,Entertaining.,My six year old boy likes it a lot - we have read it five or six times before bedtime already.
5,My Favorite Dr. Seuss Book Ever!! By Laura G.,"Some people say that this book was too long, while others said that The Cat in the Hat is better. I love this book. It was my mother's favorite as a child and she shared it with me and I'm so glad she did. I love all the characters. You can't read this book and not want to fall asleep...all the yawning in this book makes it a perfect bedtime story. An all time Seuss classic that shouldn't be overlooked!!!!! A must have for any Seuss collector!!"
5,Dr. Seuss's Sleep Book,"Not just a bedtime book, although it is one of the best around. I have used this book when tutoring dyslexic children. The alliterative rhymes on every pair of facing pages provides ample opportunity for young readers to practice their skills. In addition, each pair of facing pages is like a short, short story itself. This highly imaginative work is hilarious for the adult as well, making reading this book aloud a joy(the only way to really get the rhyme and humor), even when a child wants the book read over and over numerous times. Excellent book for children age five through adulthood!"
5,What a great bed time book!,"""This book is to be read in bed"" are the words you will find in the beginning of this book. It starts off with a little bug that yawns and then rhymes along with random silliness about going to sleep. I read this to my son for bedtime last night, and as with all Dr Seuss books, he laughed at me reading it. Words that are made up, as well as creatures, it's a great bedtime book.My son asked me a couple times ""What's that?"" when I said the name of a critter in the book and then we took time to make up our own life story of certain creatures. One of which my son decided only ate cream cheese....but it weighted minus one pound. *sigh* If only that were true. ;)This book can be just a bedtime story, or a fun activity before bed. you decide. It's a little long so it may not keep a really young child's interest, but it's still worth trying."
5,A wonderland for the mind of a child,"This delightful book is a must for all young children and parents.Filled with wonderful characters and wonderful stories, starting with the news that `Has just come in from the County of KeckThat a very small bug by the name of Van VleckIs yawning so wide you can look down his neck'It deals with a castle half way between Reno and Rome, Two very nice Foona Lagoona Baboona, and the folly of a goose and moose drinking each other's juice. It will take the little ones minds off to faraway dreamy and tranquil destinations before easing them off to sleep. It was certainly one of my childhood favourites, and one of the first books I remember."
2,Too long!,I purchased this book as a going to bed book for my baby girl. It puts me to sleep before I can even get halfway through it (so I guess it's effective). Way too long in my opinion!
2,Not the best Seuss book for babies,"Honest, I love Dr. Seuss. However, I was very disappointed with this particular book. I was searching for a good rythmic book to read to my newborn. This one was suggested because it was supposed to be good from day one on through the ages. The truth of it is, I was bored with it before I ever finished and the pictures weren't as stimulating as some of the other Seuss works. If I wasn't stimulated, I can't really imagine that either a baby or a 5-year old will be either. I actually returned the book."
5,Timeless!,This book was a favorite of mine when I was growing up and I recently pulled it out when a small child was staying at my home. She loved it!
5,Excellent Book,I hope every Mother who has a fussy baby gets a copy of this book. It truly does put babies to sleepl
5,What a Treasure,"Of all the Dr. Seuss books I have from my childhood, I hadn't seen this until browsing on Amazon. This is great! (not that I'm surprised coming from the Seuss line). I had a blast reading it, and it's the first book my new daughter has seemed to actually respond to. I'd definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a ""new read""."
4,If you want your child to fall sleep buy this book!,I had never heard of this book from Dr. Zuess and I love it!!!!! It is the best sleep book. My son falls sleep half way through this book every time. Fun to read!
5,Will last for months,"Yep, my dogs chew the heck out of these but I know from past experience it will last for a couple months before I need to replace."
2,Not as strong as most kongs,"My 80 lb lab-mix liked this thing in the beginning (it was hard for me to stuff, though), but started chewing off the ridges. Now he's nibbled down the two ends. I have many MANY other Kong toys (MANY!) and this one and the tug toy were, by far, the most prone to wear. Add to that the difficulty stuffing it and I don't think I'd buy it again."
1,NOT durable like other KONG products ! Beware...,"I have a 13 1/2 lb. ShihTzu/Yorkie mix. She is a chewer, so I got the Medium ""15-35 lb."" rated ""Medium"" Stick. I added a treat & luckily I supervised the puppy the first time I gave her the KONG Dental Stick. Within 5-10 min. at the most, she had several chunks of rubber off the end of the stick. In the past, the only toys I gave her when totally unsupervised were KONG toys. This product is definitely not nearly as durable as their other items. Unless your dog is a very gentle chewer, this is NOT a safe item. I have never had a problem with a KONG product before, but I DO NOT recommend this item."
5,My golden retriever loves this!,I throw this instead of a ball. When it hits the ground it sometimes bounces in a really random direction so it adds that variation to the fetch game. Plus the dog's teeth stay clean and white. Indestructible!
4,strong!,"My dog loves rubbery toys - and he loves to chew them to the point of destruction. The Kong toys are the only ones that can weather his chewing... and they're great to throw around so he can play fetch. He's managed to chew off a few little pieces at the ends of this toy, but on the whole it's great."
1,No good!,"This Dental Chew is no good. We gave it to our four month old Labrador puppy & within 10mins, we had piles of red rubber on the ground & she had also eaten some.I would not recommend this dental stick to anyone. I have sent it back to hopefully get a refund."
1,another kong fail,"My dogs love the classic Kongs. I was hoping to change it up with this product, but my dogs weren't really interested. The filling was too hard for them to reach. It was even worse for me. This thing is practically impossible to clean thoroughly. This is going in the trash."
1,Didn't Last Long,"This item lasted about two and a half weeks with our 6 month old lab. It wasn't long and he had chewed the edges of it and pieces started showing up all over the living room and in his ""droppings"". I think they need to make an extreem dental stick!"
5,Still Mystic Stylinn...,"Yeah B-Scan aka da Scan Man and M.C. Mack, came corret with da rest of da Kama Kazie INC., on dis unit right here, from da intro to da last word of da cd, it put's you in da mindstate of da Mystic Stlyez dayz. my fav. one so far would be number 4, da beat so hard and it's ripped well, yeah anybody dat's sleepong on da Kaze, won't be after dis cd, you got it get it, if you fan of dat Mystic Style rap, blended with some hood anthems...."
1,Whack Whack Whack!,"Can the Three 6 Mafia wannabes please stand up? Kami Kaze Inc get your as$ up! Come on, come with some originality. This CD is like a 3-6 cd without 3-6, only a bunch of nobody guest appearances. On a positive note, I rather hear them then any verse ever spit by whack ass crunchy black. Listening to crunchy black is like listening to that retarded guy rap on the Andy Milonakis Show so that doesnt say much for Kami Kaze Inc."
3,"A little better than average, perhaps...","but not great. The book is a bit narrow, there aren't that many pages, and it does not at all lie flat. From reading the stellar reviews it's received, I suppose my expectations were too high."
5,Best measuring spoons ever,"These are top notch measuring spoons. Stylish looking, easy to store - they hang; plus they FEEL good in your hand. Rubber grips make them super easy to use. And they're certainly not expensive. Go ahead.... buy them!"
4,"Overall, a good product","I bought these because they are made of metal - I was tired of my plastic measuring spoons flying around in the dishwasher. But since they are metal, when I'm measuring oil or anything else light in color, it's hard to see the amount of liquid in the spoon."
3,Not so great,"I'm a fan of many Oxo products, but I have not been happy with these spoons. My main complaint is that the hanger-like device that holds the spoons together is badly designed and annoying. It's hard to maneuver between spoons, so you wind up just taking them off and leaving the spoons loose. I'd rather have spoons that stack well and that are held together by an enclosed ring. My second complaint is that the round shape doesn't fit in narrow bottles. I'm going to purchase the Cuisipro instead. On a positive note, the Oxo set of 3 plastic bowls are absolutely fantastic. I use them every day and am buying a set for my sister too. They are lightweight, the grips are great, and they clean up like new."
4,good quality product typical of OXO,"This is a really nice set of measuring spoons. They are aesthetically pleasing, well-made, and ergonomically sound. They have been through my dishwasher about ten times already, and there are no signs of wear as of yet. I could see how the writing might eventually wear off, so it would be nice to have raised lettering (even though with only four sizes, they are easily distinguishable). Also, it would be nice if they expanded the set to at least include 1/8 teaspoon and 1/2 tablespoon. Overall, a very good set of spoons, and another quality OXO product."
4,Good strong spoons,I finally broke down and bought myself a great set of measuring spoons. These spoons are sturdy and dishwasher safe. These spoons are very strong and won't wear or break like other measuring spoons do. I like the fact that they can all be clipped on the ring or can easily come off to be used separately. Good buy.Josephine Giordano-Smith
1,Metric???,"I know the u.s., Liberia and Myanmar are the only countries in the world that don't use the metric system...so do you think writing the metric conversion on these MAY be a reasonable idea OXO? Since these are sold internationally, that may be a plan."
5,Nicely designed,These feel good in the hand and are easy to clean. You can easily take individual spoons off the ring if desired.
2,Satisfactory but expensive,"These cushions are good. They arrived on time and were in every way as promised.They are really expensive for what you get and cost me about 50% more than a pair I had ordered earlier this summer.Would not have ordered same cushions again at this price, but I wanted them to match."
4,good stuff,very good quaility for the price. stands up to water from the lawn sprinklers very well. The color is very nice.
4,excellent for the deck lounge,pillow fits nicely in the deck lounge and is very comfortable. Expensive but nice.
2,"Not worth it, get metal...","In just a short time, even by only hand washing, expect all the labels to be barely readable. It's just not worth it. I got an all metal set with etched in numbers and it has worked beautifully with no wear. These plastic ones were allocated to my son's play kitchen."
2,They FLY around in the dishwasher!,"I thought I would add an observation seemingly not made by others: these spoons are too lightweight for a dishwasher with any real power. Unless you take care to entangle them inside or under heavier items before you start the dishwasher, they will fly around inside!After discovering this, I purchased heavyweight stainless steel measuring spoons, which I do not have to worry about when putting them into the dishwasher. As a result, these plastic spoons from OXO never got used enough for the labels to wear off, so I haven't had that problem.My advice: DON'T EVER buy plastic measuring spoons, unless you WANT to clean them by hand after each and every use."
2,"Nice variety of sizes, but the labels wear away","I've had these measuring spoons for a couple of years now. The size labels have worn away on the spoons used most often. At first I thought it was because I put them in the dishwasher. However, another has disappeared even though I'm now washing them by hand. The spoons are also rather wide, making them difficult to fit into spice jars. Overall, I'm disappointed in the set."
2,Labels unreadable after about a year,"I know it's an inexpensive item, but when the labels wear off they become useless (well, I still use them based on memory and their relative sizes)"
3,Label color comes off!!! Reconsider...,It's nice to have so many options and not only the standard ones. The labels come off very easily. I am not sure it's such a good idea in the end.
2,"Good range of sizes, poor label quality","I really do like the size increments these come in. Not all sets contain a 1/2 TBSP option, and I really prefer to have one. They also look nice, initially. After a while, as others have mentioned, the labels wear off. The 1/2 tsp also started to fall apart in the dishwasher. I've had these for a couple of years and guess I need to replace them. I prefer to be able to glance quickly at my spoons and grab the one I need. I didn't mind the size, actually. Most of the spices I buy have removable plastic lids and the spoons fit into the jars fine. I'm guessing from the other reviews that other spice brands must not be this way."
2,Labels rub off,"Love the spoons themselves, and they have held up over the past 2 years I've had them..... I LOVE oxo stuff.... But unfortunately, this is my second set to have the labels rub off. I have to guess which is which now. I don't own a dishwasher, so I can't blame it on the type of dishwashing. I'd go for something else."
4,Nice Measuring Spoons,"I like most all of Oxo products, so ordered these measuring spoons. They are plastic, and the set even includes the 1/8 teaspoon (smidge). They are slightly enongated to help facilitate reaching into spice jars. The only reason I am only giving them four stars is that after using them, I'm not that crazy about ""black"" measuring implements because it's hard to see if all of the ingredient came out of the spoon."
1,The labels wore off ONTO MY SKIN!,"Not only did the measurement marks wear off, but they wore off ONTO MY SKIN. I've owned these for under a year! I understand fading after dishwasher cycles--it's the downside of plastic measuring tools. But I don't want this paint in my FOOD or even on my skin! I've written to the company--but don't buy these."
1,Labels Wear Off--Good for a very short time!,"They work, but not once the labels wash off and they do wash off pretty easily."
2,"Labels rub off very quickly, and made of plastic.","We are trying to rid our lives of all plastic, whether BPA-free or not, but bought these well before that change. They seem kind of cheap, but do function ok, which is why I gave them two stars instead of one.THE LABELS WEAR OFF EVEN AFTER A FEW GENTLE HAND WASHINGS. I never sent them through the dishwasher, and was careful not to scrub the size labels at all, to no avail.I would spend 5 more dollars and get some stainless steel ones. In fact, try to convert all your kitchenware into Pyrex glass, stainless steel, and bamboo. You won't regret the quality or the health benefits."
5,measuring spoon set,An ergonomically designed set of 6 accurate spoons with good balance at a good price.
1,Junk!,Very poor quality control!Labels wore off after a few uses!!!The label should have been molded into the plastic.
5,Good feel + handy,I only wish I'd gotten these earlier! They are functional and I feel like I've got a good grip.
1,Might as well be disposable,"Like others have said, the labels come off. I don't mean they wear off after time and many uses, they literally can be rubbed right off by sliding your finger over the label.Normally, OXO's stuff is great, but these are terrible quality."
5,No issues with numbers wearing off.,"So one of the biggest complaints on this product was the markings wearing off, sometimes very fast. We were victim of this with a set of the OXO measuring cups, they lost their markings and it's very hard to see what they are.However with the newest set of OXO measuring cups, and with these measuring spoons, we haven't had any issues. The markings are raised up, so even if the markings had come of (they haven't) you would be able to tell what it was still. They've been through the dishwasher multiple times, and still there, so I think they've finally fixed their issue.Other than that, these are great measuring spoons, easily pulling off the ring without having to open the entire ring up, and work great like I expect OXO products to."
2,"Works, sort of","I bought this because I needed an inexpensive way to balance my mower blades. It does this, but is difficult to use and is not very sensitive. A blade has to be severely out before you can tell on this, and the tool has to be resting on a level surface to be accurate. This tool also pivots both directions (laterally and longitudinally), so it is difficult to tell where the heavy side really is. This is better than nothing, but just."
2,Much ado about nothing,"Marina loves Sebastian - no, wait, she's determined not to be attracted to him because she's got to marry Don Felipe to save her family. Sebastian loves Marina - no, wait, he's determined to be only sexually attracted to her, and takes revenge on her because she scarred his face with her ring when she (justifibly) fought off his potential rape.And oh, there's Marina's cousin Carmen flaunting herself around too, but, no, wait, Carmen's secretly in love with Marina's brother, who's missing in the Caribbean, but no, he's not missing after all and turns up just in time to think Sebastian is Carmen's lover...oh, what a mess!And actually a big boring mess at that."
1,WORST soundtrack ever,"this has to be the worst soundtrack ever. most of mtv's soundtracks aren't very good, but this is the worst. i highly reccomend you NOT waste your money on this, even if your a fan of the show like i am."
5,Must-have,"I use this more stirring soups and sauces. It is great and easy to clean (just toss it in the dishwasher). OXO is also nice enough, yet simple, so you can use it as serveware for a casual dinner with friends."
3,Works good,"Not much to review - it's a cooking/serving spoon. The grip is good. The spoon itself is good size. However, in my opinion, it's too tall for every day use. Therefore, I only use for my ""big pots""."
1,mesh ring,I was very disappointed in the ring. The color is grey not sterling bright. I was looking for the somerset mesh ring but it was not available in size 9 so ordered this one which looked the same but was NOT i plan to return the ring.
2,great at first,This is a nice ring. I thought it very pretty when I first received it. Over time it seems to have faded in color and I no longer wear it.
3,Workmenship,This is a very pretty ring.It has one flaw. The mesh can become slightly unraveled around the edges and get caught on cloth material.
3,5 stars for the film 3 for the DVD!,This is an excellent film beautifully acted surprisingly by Phoebe Cates as well as a wonderful supporting cast. Jim Broadbent as the drunken Mr Worell is hilarious and pitiful at the same time.(He is currently in Moulin Rouge as Mr. Ziedler and was in Topsy Turvy as well.) Stephen Rea is marvelous as the intelligent reporter and Kevin Kline (Phoebe's husband in real life the last time I heard.) Has a great role as Frixos the head butler. What a charming and delightful tale. Unfortunately you would think studios would have figured out by now that DVD's need more features to sell as well as a choice of Widescreen or Standard. This one is ONLY in Standard and very little in the way of specila features...
5,Princess Caraboo,"This is one of my alltime favorite movies. I was greatly pleased with the speedy arrival, and yet the price tag was a tolerable value."
1,I did not enjoy this film,"I am surprised at the high marks that some others gave this film. I found it slow and unexciting. Phoebe Cates brilliant? I hardly thought so. It was simply not my kind of film. You will know within 15 minutes whether it is for you or not. If you don't like it, turn it off, because it does not get any better."
1,WARNING!!!!! 1990's REPRINT,"It is very irritating to purchase a book---and this is the more expensive hardcover!!!! --- and then find out it is a reprint. So, beware!"
3,Facets by Barbara Delinsky,I liked this book but it is not up to Barbara's usual high standards.I continue to read her stories as she has become a supreme story teller and I always learn something in each book.
2,Move on,"This knife is actually pretty dull. The tip of it broke off within a couple weeks of receiving it. Seems to be of very poor quality, I expected more from KitchenAid."
1,Mes pauvres oreilles!,"Il existe des ultrasons que seules les oreilles extrment fines de certains animaux comme le chien peuvent entendre.J'ai souhaité que Céline chante dans la gamme des ultra-sons quand j'ai écouté cet horrible concert.Non seulement n'a-t-elle aucune présence sur scène mais ses fréquents débordements de fausse sincérité flagrants m'ont horipilés.Mais si ce n'était que a... Malheureusement, Céline bénéficie aussi d'un organe vocal tellement puissant et désagréable qu'on ne peut s'empcher de rver à son prochain congé sabatique. Sa voix est telle que j'ai l'impression que son séjour prochain à Las Vegas servira en fait à établir un nouveau type d'armement sonore pour l'armée américaine afin de bombarder Sadam Hussein.Somme toute, c'est un DVD que j'offrirais sans pitié à mon pire ennemi si j'avais vraiment de l'argent à dépenser pour lui rendre la vie plus pénible."
3,"Is this the only Streisand/Dion ""Tell Me"" duet?","I'd like to get the Celine Dion/Barbra Streisand ""Tell Me"" DVD duet. Is this the only one recorded?"
5,Review for Au Coeur Du Stade,I purchased this DVD a couple of months ago. This video includes alot of her popular hits (French and English) as well as backstage footage of her recording songs for the albums S'il Suffisait d'Aimer and Let's Talk About Love. I highly recommend that you buy this DVD because this one is the best out of all her videos. It is a must have for any fan!
4,Big Stadium concert - with still the closeness.,"Great show, big stadium, great sound, great production.Maybe a bit too much French stuff for the overall international market, but still, a great DVD to have in your collection."
5,What a show!!!,"I was worried when I first purchased this because it is a french DVD and the only French I speak is Bonjour and Merci; however, Celine's sheer vocal perfection shines through no matter what language you speak. With a sensational blend of uptempo and smooth slow songs this concert is a treasure! The gigantic audience surrounding the stage adds to the excitment flowing throughout the show. After the duet with Jean-Jacque Goldman it is touching to hear him, along with the entire stadium serenade Celine. What only adds to this great show is the behind the scenes footage. It includes time in the recording studio for the making of the severly multiplatinum ""Let's Talk About Love"" and ""Sil Suffisait d'Aimer"". My only complaint about this DVD is not being able to understand what Celine is saying between songs. Other than that, great buy!"
5,Celine Dion - au coeur du stade,"We are French Canadian. We like Celine Dion and this concert is the better we saw. We recommand it.Somos canadienses de Quebec. Nos gusta mucho a Celine Dion y este concierto es el mejor que vimos desde siempre. Aunque es in frances, les asegaramos que va a encantarles.Gracias."
5,Spatula that you'll adore.,Another fine product by Oxo Good Grips. Good value for a sturdy spatula that will not bend out of shape. Love the comfy grip too.
2,Problems with front edge,"The front edge of this turner is too thick to slide easily under tortillas or pancakes. And the curve makes it almost impossible to spread a thin slick of oil across my skillet. Next time I'll buy a cheap, thin one from the dollar store, and be sure it has a straight front edge."
5,Love it,"Came in a timely manner, looks like it's good quality and strong! Can't wait to start using it, stainless doesn't look like it will rust."
3,Christmas Gift,i bought this as a Christmas Gift for my daughter for Christmas. She hasn't used it yet to let me know how it works.
4,Less battle than human psyche,"The Atlantis crew is classed as mostly scum and the story makes me wonder if Dibner did serve with such a gang. The first part of the story focuses on internal strains that widen into serious cracks in morale and behavior. Long, grueling patrols at sea will do that. The captain himself has not yet been tested in battle and the reader wonders how he will function when his moment comes. When the ship actually engages the Japanese cruisers, flaws and heroes come flying into light of scrutiny. It's quite an epic, from beginning to end.All the Drowning Seas: The Nicholas Everard World War II Saga Book 3"
3,crumb`s follow-up,"every old school metal fan should have this one in their collection based on the superb debut album life of dreams,though to me it doesn`t deliver the same hard core sound,the crumbs changed on this album,they became more of a metal band than a raw hardcore punk band."
5,This album is the BOMB,"How exciting to find this little treasure in the store the other day. Had a dub of this album years ago when it first came out and I played the hell out of it. It's been out of print until lately. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! It's a breath of fresh air for any true friend of thrash. The sound is very tight and clean, intelligent writing, great musicians. The first track is one of my favorites with the piano intro, but all the tracks are good. HAIL CRUMBSUCKERS!"
4,A strong follow up,"An album which definately takes a long time to get into. Mainly due to the abysmal vocals. The music is a lot more slowed down, and of a more metallic direction. Not as intense or brutal as their 'Life of Dreams' debut two years later this is nonetheless a worthy followup with great musicianship. Unfortunatley this hreat band whick spilt up to form the appalling Pro-pain. Shame."
4,Tight Stuff,I love this cd because juvnile is in this cd and mack 10 and I love those artists and they are one of my favorites. I cant belive nobody has rated this cd because it is tight cd.
4,"Sad, uplifting, and everything in between.","Morrissey's 1991 re-recording of his 1984 first album, Bill Morrissey captures the vulnerability and the hillarity of the artist. There is something for everyone on this disc, from the funny and hopeful ""Darlin Lisa"" to the bleakly troubling ""Rosie"". The album captures what Folk music is all about - life."
5,I love Art Tatum,"I own all 8 Pablo Solo Masterpiece CDs and consider those discs to contain the standard against which all other Tatum recordings should be measured against. The setting, recording, pacing, arrangements, playing; everything about those is absolutely priceless, pristine & perfect.This 2 CD set of material from private parties is a wonderful artifact to have also. It's lovely to be able to hear Tatum in this setting even though slighly less than ideal. His ideas are brilliant as always.I would not suggest ""20th Century Piano Genius"" as the CD to start with if you are new to Tatum or don't yet have any of the Pablo series. But it is a great addition to the recorded legacy of Art Tatum's beautiful genius."
2,Way too ever done.,This is nothing more that Art Tatum trying to show off his fingering skills on the piano for his girlfriend. I have other Art Tatum CD's that are far more entertaining. This CD shouldn't have been made.
4,Chekov ... photon torpedoes fire!,The beginning of the Third Season was really good. This episode is no exception. The battle scene was one of the series finest. You then have Kirk and Elaan ending their fling in order to do their duties and responsibilities. This is a nice little episode.
3,"Fun, fun, fun","Yes, it's a fun show. Especially when Kirk tries to teach Elaan how to eat properly and control her temper. The klingons make a guest appearance during a cool attack scene at the end. Not emmy material, but a decent third season episode."
4,Embryology for Basic Sciences,This book is a good reference book for your embryology course during Basic Sciences. The most useful part for me have been the practise questions. LWW gives you on-line access to the questions so you do not have to carry the book around with you all of the time. This book may be a bit to indepth to use while reviewing for STEP 1 if you have a limted amount of time.
4,Good overall review,Works well for those who have already studied the material in a textbook and are just reviewing the basics.
2,Not a good idea to get this book!,"This book falls into the category of way too much! Sometimes the BRS series is the best thing in the world, and sometimes it just bites. Unfortunally this book falls into the later. It is overwhelming to try and read through. It is ridden with detail after detail that makes it horribly difficult to read. It isn't even feasible to use this book along with class because it would take longer to read through this book then take the class that only last a couple weeks. Getting straight to the point, unless you want to spend insane amounts of time on embryology, don't bother with this book. Look to the high-yield series for a much better embryology source."
3,High Yield Embryo is Better,This is alright for review but also purchased the High Yield and it was a better review for me.
5,Veggie must,"A slotted spoon is a must-have with vegetables. I like how OXO is nice enough that you can use it as serve ware for a casual dinner. The slots separate the juices and the veggies, so you don't have a soggy plate."
3,Good for heartier cooking,"I was surprised at the size of this spoon. The length of the handle is just right, but the spoon part is really big. It's nice if I'm using it to cook heavier or heartier foods with, but if I'm cooking pasta or something lighter, it's kind of a pain.As for the product as a whole, it feels really good in my hands. It's not at all heavy and it doesn't feel awkward at all. It's made with very good material and it's really easy to clean."
4,It's slotted,"Not much to review - it's a cooking/serving spoon. The grip is good. The spoon itself is good size. However, in my opinion, it's too tall for every day use. Therefore, I only use for my ""big pots""."
4,It's a psych classic from UK!,"Don't care about the previous review. It is a real classic from the British psychedelia. There are all the wonderful tracks from that period. If you like the Syd Barrett's Pink Floyd, or the Soft Machine, this is a must. There is a more complete compilation called ""Dive Into Yesterday"" that has many tracks from this album and the complete second album. But this one has some previously unreleased BBC radio tracks.It used to be very rare and expensive. I recomend!"
2,Compositionally repetitive familiarity does hold a few tricks,"2 1/2Completely predictable and familiar sounding folk rock of yesteryear, yet sometimes presented in a way that somehow seems unique enough to make this British band still contain some sort of edge today; with some grooving percussion, the band easily lends many of their ordinarily written songs some extra flow. Alas, what little flourishes we see in the way of percussion, guitar, and vocal work eventually do end up dissolving into just another generically groovy time."
3,Oops not Tangerine Dream at all!,"Often misplaced in CD stores as a ""T.D."" release and probably the reason this old psyche relic exists at all is the fact it's called T.D. Actually this is a British psyche band that released two albums under Kaleidoscope two years before the German T.D. band existed. Kaleidoscope were an early (Syd era) Pink Floyd inspired band who came close to copying Pink Floyd singles ""See Emily Play"" and especially ""Arnold Lane"" as a personal style. They had no hits but there entire first album here is based on those two songs and if you like that stuff its pretty good over all. Sorry no kraut rock here!"
4,GREAT sound,This CD is AWESOME. I've been listening to it in my car for weeks now. I highly recommend purchasing; the vocals and instrumentation are great - interesting song subjects too. Enjoy.
2,Unmemorable Psych-Fluff,"Not to be confused with the US '60s band Kaleidoscope, this is a UK 60's outfit whose output consisted of really wimpy psychedelia sung by high, non-descript voices. The instrumentation lacks any meat, but if you like things like Donovan's more embarrassingly hippy-dippy songs, then this may be for you. Otherwise gets pretty boring."
3,GREAT PRODUCT BUT MISLEAD PIC !!!!!,"Hi,I've bought this product thinking there were two conditioners and therefore it was a good price for both of them. In the picture it says ""2 pack"". There are other stores that sell this item a lot cheaper. Please take off that picture and put one that will not mislead de costumers. I like the product but didn't like the way I was mislead.Regards"
4,Interesting,"I consider this book an interesting tool for an international law class, because of its variety of cases and its handling of matters such as jus cogens, that makes it really didactic and comprehensible. Worth to be have in mind by University professors, students and investigators of this law area."
5,Song called CRY,"You CAN find the song CRY on the CD VH-1 Hits of the 80s. Their CD Crime and Punishment had some great tunes on it. Wish I could find the MP3 song, Crime and Punishment"
3,The History of Mix,I have wanted this recording since I was in high school and I finally have it in CD. The only problem I have is that the CD cannot be read by my computer therefore I can't put it on my I=Pod. But the music is fantastic on the CD. One of the songs on the Godley and Creme CD I recently heard on a commercial. I so happy to see that this fantastic recording continues to be 'fresh'!
3,Judy Strikes Oil,A great Saturday Matinee movie. Judy Canova is always entertaining and gives a positive attitude to every situation. Her way of handling things always saves the day and you always want to stay in the theatre and see her movie over again. She's delightfully corn-pone and magical.
5,Awesome Historical Look at Mini Golf,"Great pictures, cool cover - this is the best book I've seen on mini golf...and I've played in the Mini Golf Masters Tournament."
2,Not very well researched,The information from the 20's to 40's I can't argue with its the period from the 50's to the 70's that they didn't seem to research very well. Its as if they relied on one or to sources for their information
3,right philosophy but not enough detail!,"This book did reinforce my conviction that my baby can grow up perfectly healthy on a whole foods vegeterian/vegan diet (I don't eat any meat and am lactose intolerant and it appears that he is too). However, the book did not provide nearly enough information to guide me in planning a healthy diet for him. It said which foods COULD be introduced when, but not which ones SHOULD be. It did not address complementing as opposed to replacing breastmilk while introducing solids. I am a working mother, but still breastfeeding my 10 mo. old baby 3-4 times a day (including pumping), and am at in dispute with the day-care doctor who says my baby does not get enough protein (At the day care they normally introduce meat at 7-8 months). I expected to find more information on QUANTITIES of solid foods and certain nutrients (protein and others) babies need at what age."
4,Its real. Its true.,This album speaks the truth about the M-town in and around 1997. Its like a biography of the streets of Memphis around the time. Definitely cop this cd.
4,Another Icon plays with Oscar Peterson,"Whoever plays with Oscar Peterson and his renowned Trio (Herb Ellis on guitar) usually shine... but Louis Armstrong really shines here. It's one of my favorite Armstrong releases (even though it's Oscar Peterson's). My my what a combination, the recording is just okay (tape hiss) but the musicianship is rock solid. Louis' vocals are slightly subdude, but lends a wonderful rich quality to the tracks. Great sessions, made even greater by the old, trusty vocal and horn work generated by Louis Armstrong. Did I say ""Rock Solid?"" I should have said Jazz Solid."
2,Disappointing,I'm a big fan of Louis Armstrong and also have great respect for Oscar Peterson--they are great musicians. But I was disappointed in this CD. The music is lackluster (bordering on boring) and the sound-quality is not great. (I have the 1990 issue on Verve.) I have tried listening to it several times but I simply cannot stay interested.
5,A perfect breyer horse for your collection!,"I think this horse is the one you can't miss out for your collection! I got the last one on Amazon and when I saw the package, I was jumping up and down! Topper is an amazing horse. He is beautiful with the saddle and bridle. The mold used was the first one Breyer made! The video is great do. I highly reccomend this item. Trust me! Buy it."
4,QUEEN OF HONKY TONK STREET,I ORDER THIS FOR MY UNCLE LOVED THIS RECORD I HAD IT RECORDED ON A CD FOR HIM! IT WAS IN REAL GOOD SHAPE
4,Easy to hold,My daughter got this for Christmas. She loves it. Pooh and Roo take a bath and it gets her excited for bath time.
2,Not as Described,"Condition was much worse than advertised. I threw it away when I got it as it was dirty and worn out, I wouldn't even consider giving it to my child. It's too bad, looked like a cute book."
4,"My daughter loves it, however, Mommy ...","My daughter loves Pooh and loves this book, however she liked it a little too much - she chewed the whole thing apart as soon as she got it. I was a little disappointed by the the size of the book -- I didn't realize that it was only about 4 inches."
2,blowout,"I have heard so much about Bocelli,that my expectations may have been too high.The sound quality of this CD left alot to be desired.There were moments that Bocelli's voice was soooooo sweet.There is no strain in this man's voice.Though the voices are completely different Bocelli's voice was smooth like the late Perry Como's voice was NO STRAIN.In Pavoratti's voice at times there is a strain not with Bocelli.I would put him right there with the great Mario Lanza.I have yet been discourage and will buy another Bocelli CD."
3,Obviously less than perfect,"I love Andrea Bocelli, but in spite of a few pleasing moments, the whole thing is less than perfect. That voice is still there, though..."
1,Awful,If you have a good impression from Bocelli - then don't listen this CD or all good impressions will suddenly change to awful nightmare.
1,SACRED ARIAS - does not give that Christmas music feeling,Looking for Holiday Music for a dinner party I went to Amazon and typed in Christmas CD. This CD came up as a Christmas choice. It doesn't sound very much like Christmas music to me. The value and shipping were very inexpensive so the sound of it was my only disappointment.
4,Musical Selection,"Bocelli's voice salvages this CD - but barely. I am not particularly fond or contempuous of opera but I was not, to be frank, overly excited with the arias on this CD. I'll blame my lack of enthusiasm on my take it or leave it attitude relating to opera."
2,Sorry to say this...,"I adore Bocelli, but this is a huge disappointment. What was the record company thinking? Everything he's done up until this release was just so wonderful; Sogno blew me away. This is like a throw-away. Who cares? Perhaps it will sell better world-wide, but I think he's really reaching and there's nothing new here. Too bad. I guess they'll just release anything with his name on it."
2,Make my arias profane,"A wise man told me years ago that the reason the Church banned so much operatic music at Mass was not that it was distracting, but because it was so bad.I find this selection to reinforce that judgment. Sorry that I bought it, and sorry that I looked forward to hearing it. I would give it away if I knew someone that I disliked that much."
1,A Christmas Nightmare,What else can you say about someone who can't sing without massive electronic amplification and blending?
5,Wonderful music,What a wonderful CD! This is music I will listen to over and over - his voice is amazing!
5,Andrea Bocelli earned his wings.,"This is THE MOST beautiful Christmas music ever sung before. When Andrea Bocelli sings, chills run up and down my spine. Excellent buy! I am ordering more of this CD for gift giving!"
5,SACRED ARIAS,"BOCELLI: THIS CD IS WONDERFUL, THE MUSIC IS PEACEFUL AND ENCHANTING, AN ITALIAN MASTERPIECE."
4,An inspiring album from an inspiring man. . .,"Andrea Bocelli is not and never will be Pavarotti, or Domingo. This is not a problem. (I'll never play golf like Jack Nicklaus!) The passion in his music is unmistakable and penetrating. The love he holds for his faith and his music surges through every number on this album. One can only admire Bocelli's courage in overcoming his handicap in such magnificant fashion.This album brings tears to my eyes every time I listen to it. Those music critics who merely point out Bocelli's flaws need to listen with their heart as well as with their ears."
3,Sacred indeed,"Very good solid album, but it's not my favorite. If you are an opera buff I would advice you to listen to Franco Corelli's album ""Sacred Songs."" Nevertheless, a great relaxing album of Arias with an interesting interpretation of Bocelli that stands on it's own. His singing on this album is effortless and beautiful."
2,As an avid Bocelli fan; I am disappointed in this effort.,"While Andreas' artistry is unquestioned, this is what happens when a record company feels they have to release product. Many of the tracts are from previous releases and I am finding little emotional reason to listen to this CD again. His previous efforts are much more interesting and satisfying."
1,Each piece recorded at drastic varying volumes - ouch!,"I made a special trip to pick-up ""Sacred Arias"" for a gift. I played it and each piece came on at a drastic varying volume from the one before. One piece even had a chatter voice skip. Others, the volume jumped within the piece. Did I get a bad recording or did someone turn out some quick junk?"
1,Voice failing to serve the music well,"Bocelli has always wanted to sing opera and in this album, he tries to perform some heavier stuff. Unfortunately, his voice and style let him down. His voice doesn't possess adequate tone colour for the pieces and the sound he produces can even sound constricted at times. As a result, not only is he unable to express fully the meanings and emotions behind the pieces with his bland singing, on a purely vocal level, his performances can't even be termed beautiful, let alone inspirational, even when one is prepared to disregard all those electronic enhancement involved to beef up his voice artificially. Such performances just can't do the music any justice and, in some instances, are a downright misrepresentation of the works featured. Thoroughly disappointing!"
1,As seen on TV?,"The sticker on the celophane wrapper notes this was ""seen on TV."" It sounds as though it were recorded from TV, with a single microphone in the middle of the room. Painful to the ear."
5,"Beautiful Performed, Soulfully Expressed","Andrea's voice is indeed different than other traditional tenors such as Pavorotti in that there is a sweetness to his voice that is almost childlike in its innocence. This CD is a beautiful, soulful rendition of the beautiful, sacred songs that I remember while in Church as a child. There is a pleading in Andreas voice almost in an attempt to reach to the very heavens to compel God to reach down and touch his child with the love of a Father. I love this CD and all of my CD's by Andrea. I also have CD's from Mr. Pavorotti as well but the two voices are very different and rightly so. Every artist has his own signature and Andrea's voice is indeed his own -- gifted by the heavens. If you love Andrea's voice, then you will love this CD."
3,"Good, but a little disappointing","After seeing Bocelli perform on tv and how magical his voice sounded with such apparently little effort, I rushed out to purchase one of his cd's. I thought this cd would be a sure winner with his voice and sacred music combined but quite honestly none of his three renditions of Ave Marie really moved me. Don't get me wrong, he is a fabulous talent and this cd is nice background music for the holidays. However, I was looking for music to turn up loud and really be moved by and this cd just wasn't it. I will be trying another of his cd's in hopes of capturing some of the magic I know is possible from his voice."
2,I don't like it,"Chesp recording, few songs, a big rip off bad quality sebpnd me a refund I want my money back now"
5,Andrea Bocelli: Sacred Arias,"An excellent selection of sacred arias, which can be listened to at Christmastime, as well as the rest of the year. Beautiful."
2,Not so good.......,"This guy doesn't have that great a voice and says the same things over and over again. Not inspirational or emotional, just plain. Two stars because Celine Dion (one of my idols) loved him enough to sing ""The Prayer"" with him and they did it at the Oscars. So, unless you like emotionless opra, don't waste your time and money. Spend it on the BACKSTREET BOYS! They RULE FOREVER!"
4,"Great, love his music. Should make another Xmas Rec.",if list is 10.98 and your offer 13.98 where is the savings? Purchased 5 @ 9.99 at COSTCO...
2,"Pleasant ""Arias,"" but why settle?","Andrea Bocelli has a beautiful voice that sounds wonderful in pop songs but comes off as pleasant, but light-weight, in classical songs and arias. Thomas May's article mentions that Andrea Bocelli found inspiration from listening to Franco Corelli's recordings of sacred arias. If you really want to hear how thrilling these sacred arias can sound, listen to Franco Corelli's ""Songs & Arias"" and don't settle for ""Sacred Arias."""
5,more of the same,I simply agree that he was meant to sing! I just wish there was a complete Andrea Bocelli Christmas CD available.
5,This CD is graceful,"This Cd is really wonderful. you feel like you're really in a church , praying for the lord you love.thank you Andrea for this nice Cd. you're very wonderful as usual as."
3,"Powerful, spiritual, and inspirational listening","I feel semi-fortunate not to be educated in music, because I can't compare Bocelli's voice with anyone else's and I can appreciate it fully for what it is, standing on its own. And on its own, I believe that Bocelli sings these arias in a rich, powerful, and spiritual voice that is full of feeling and meaning. I was fascinated to hear the different versions of Ave Maria, formerly being familiar only with Schubert's version. And I happened to hear his Panis Angelicus for the first time as I was driving across the desert, descending into a panoramic valley surrounded by dramatic mountains at sunset, as Bocelli's voice rang out, as though he were witnessing the same evidence of God's glory that I was at that very moment. These are songs of faith, and I believe that Bocelli sings them from his heart."
2,a little disappointed,"I am a Bocelli fan. I looooove his Sogno CD. I think his voice is extraordinary. That being said, I was a little disappointed in this CD. It was well, ordinary if not boring. Nice as background music but not moving as his other works."
5,None Better,"This collection of sacred arias is beautiful, and it seems to me, heartfelt. The artist's voice is rich and has the feeling required by this music.I don't care what the critics say about this one. Hear it for yourself."
4,Bocelli CDs Getting Better,"The last one I received as a gift was incredibly bland--both the selections for the various tracks as well as his singing. It was terrible as classical music and even poor as popular music. It was ""plastic"" AS IF on sale for $2.99 at Wal-Mart! This one was much better with an excellent selection of pieces and more color and variation in his voice. The Mozart ""Ave Verum Corpus"" and the three ""Ave Maria"" selections were all performed magnificently. I could have done without the two Christmas carols on the last two tracks, but otherwise it was very enjoyable. Just maybe I'll buy a Bocelli CD with my own money next time."
4,A must have for the commute,I can listen to Bocelli sing Schubert's Ave Maria over and over. This CD is a wonderful tension tamer for the commute to and from work.
1,junk,this turner melted in less than 5 seconds in a medium heated wok--i had to throw out my meal and reseason my wok--i can not rate it low enough-it should be zero stars or in the negitive numbers
5,Pretty Darn Good,"This is one of Sherrie's greatest, if not best songs. I love the poetic way the lyrics flow."
4,Class text for Intro to PDE course,"A good text to begin learning PDE with- I looked at two other books and preferred learning from this one over the others. The notation is clear, the worked examples are enough to get you started without baby-stepping through everything. Challenging hw problems, and the lessons are well laid out."
5,Great text to learn PDE's,Took two semesters of PDE's and this was used for the 2nd semester course. Very good for learning and for reference.
1,Astonishing error,"The book tries to ""prove"" the maximum principle resorting to an argument based on steady-state solutions to the Laplace equation. This makes no sense whatsoever because time does not enter the Laplace equation. I found this error so astonishing that I gave up on the text. One can only imagining how confusing a student would find this type of explanation. Maybe it is the only such error in the book..... but it is hard to believe it has survived to a 4th edition."
4,Pretty good,"Pretty good book to learn from. Well laid out. Some areas could be clearer, but will use often!"
3,Crayola Majic 3D,This is a neat product but I was looking for something my 2 year old could draw wthout having color in a picture. I was looking for plain paper she could draw free-hand pictures.
5,oxo is the best.. I just love this spoon....,Its impossible to buy bad stuff from oxo... Everything they make is high end..super quality... I love their rubber handled utencils...They are easy on the hands and are dishwasher safe... The metal is thick and of real quality... You cant go wrong with these products....
4,ScrEmo isn't all that bad...,"So I'm reading all these reviews and I'm thinking WTF is wrong with you ppl. it's music you don't need to get so meladramatic, with that out of the way I will actually review the album.Track 1 is an instrumental usually i HATE them but for once I didn't mind it was pretty interesting to listen to.Track 2 RAD-NESS I wanted to listen to it again though because I can't understand what sonny's saying :)Track 3 THE BEST ON THE ALBUM (other than ride the wings...)track 4 is slightly blandTrack 9 KISS ME I'M CONTAGIOUS I<3333 That they wrote this song I could kiss them it RAWKS and it rawks hard lol!Track 11 Ride the wings of pestilance Is the first song on here I heard and I'm happy I did It helped me get through some of my angst .Over all I LOVE this album and am happy I bought it."
5,"Dear Diary, I Have a New Favourite CD","There are few words to describe how exquisite this album is. I will recommend who should NOT buy this album, though. People who only like one sound, people who dislike experimentation, people who dislike post-hardcore and hardcore/metal/classic rock purists.All right, I'll recommend songs to different listening groups.Straight up rock: ""One Armed Boxer..."" ""Note to Self,"" ""Secrets Don't Make Friends,"" ""Featuring Some of Your Favourite Words""This new age ""emo"": ""Emily,"" ""Populace in Two.""Electronic Rock/ New wave: ""I Liked You Better Before You Were Naked On the Internet.""Metal: ""Ride the Wings of Pestilence.""Comedy: ""Kiss Me I'm Contagious,"" ""Hidden Track.""Really, if you like a mish-mosh of sounds, buy this album.I must say the Hidden Track is my favourite song on the album. Not only is the lyrical content hilarious, it shows the guys don't take themselves too seriously, like so many bands."
3,Very helpful seller,"I never actually listened to this cd. I got it for someone else and after I placed the order, I realized I could have had the seller send it directly. I sent him a message and it was sent to where I needed it to go. Very helpful."
3,"More decent, but run of the mill ""Screamo""","Thursday was my first taste of this genre. I thought it was an awsome sound, and I couldnt get enough of it. Next was Taking Back Sunday, Thrice, and Rufio, and it was good. Now, 9 million bands later, and I'm having trouble telling them apart. I have now had enough of said sound."
5,Excellent ScrEmo!,"I don't know what that Casey Miles guy is talking about. This album is awesome. It's the perfect wedding of talent and creativity, and it's very original as well. Kind of like the novel Hellstone by The Great Daniel White. I've never read anything more original than that. It amazes me that such a complex, emotional story can fit into one brain. From First to Last should do a concept album based on that book, otherwise known as The Second Greatest Novel Ever Written, second only to The Cat in the Hat by Dr. Seuss. From First to Last should do a concept album based on that book too."
4,A Tip For FFTL...,"A few stand-out songs, such as Note to Self, and Ride the Wings of Pestilence. More songs similar to Ride the Wings could have pushed this album over the line from good to great. The screaming in this band is amazing, and they should use it more!"
2,FFTL going downhill,"From First to Last used to be a band about passion and not fashion I love FFTL don't get me wrong but in this days how music business it's just crap, I remember seeing this band with their old singer before they became ""oh so famous"" and they were one energetic band I've always liked but after they got their new singer it's not the same thing as old FFTL it's just like every other band in this days like MCR, TBS, etc... if you ever have a chance go listen to ""Aesthetic EP"" by FFTL and see the difference between each one of them and you will see what I mean...and this album has too many soft songs too, 1 or 2 soft songs are not bad but there is a lot more and there is almost no screaming as in their last EP what a dissapointment...."
2,Just buy the good songs off of iTunes,"first off, I'm into all the emo/screamo/alternative stuff. The Used, Senses Fail, Underoath, all of it. But this CD just doesn't cut it. It's not that it's bad, the songs just arent that interesting. Many of the songs just seem to have the same part it. The singer holding a note with the drummer riding on the double-bass pedal with mindless gutiar. of course tha's nto teh hole song. But each song seems to have that part in it. There a few good songs, like secrets don't make friends, and a few others. But it's not worth getting the whole CD. Just buy the good ones off of iTunes."
1,Sremo.... Have you people went f*cking nuts?,"This is the worst piece of sh*t I have ever heard, My cousin let me listen to it and asked me what I thought? I told her if she wasn't family I would have slapped the cr*p out of her for listening to this cry baby bull sh*t!! What ever happened to good old rock like AC/DC? You people are idiots for buying this garbage. You are making a BUNCH OF LITTLE SPOILED RICH KIDS EVEN RICHER, WAY TO GO ASSH*LES!!!"
4,Such a Tragedy that Phil left,"This CD does not compare to their debut EP. The editing and production is much better because of Epitaph. Otherwise, the band seemed to have lost a great sound with the loss of their former frontman Phil Reardon. Nonetheless, I think Sonny Moore is a great vocalist and did a wonderful job on this CD. However, if you have liked From First to Last from the begining and were fans of songs like ""Such a Tragedy"" and ""My Heart in Your Hands"" you will be slightly dissapointed with the debut album. This CD definately targets a new audience than the EP did. I personally am a fan of both albums, I was just a little shocked when I heard Sonny's voice instead of Phil's. The EP is still much better, and I would recommend it to all From First to Last fans, but this album is very good too, just different."
2,Pure Crap,"This band is terrible... this cd is even more terrible. It's amusing how marketable emo garbage just seems to keep coming and coming and people just eat it up for some odd reason. The only song I had any enjoyment listening to was ""Ride the Wings of Pestilence"" (hey, it's ""catchy""). But other than that this band and album is a complete waste of time.The singing is god-awful and the guitar riffs are boring and typical. Every song is repetetive and sleep inducing. If you wanna hear real emotional (NO, not emo) hardcore check out Misery Signals. They have more talent in their fingernails then this band does in their entire bodies."
2,Hmph,"Don't take my word as gospel; I haven't listened to this whole record. But I heard one song, Note to Self, and I don't think the singer hit a single note in-pitch, probably because he was singing way too high for his own health. Being a drummer, I noticed that the drummer is pretty good, and the music sounded good enough. But I just couldn't get past the vocals to give this album much of a chance. Sorry."
5,I love this book!,"This is a really good book. I'm reading it now for the second time. Crowley is a fascinating writer, and this book would be great for most people to read. It has some nice insights into human behavior, and would probably be quite helpful for anyone trying to understand addiction. It would also be good for someone who is just looking for an entertaining book."
5,Best Crowley Book and a Top-Ten 1920s Novel,"It's Crowley at his heart-felt Magickal best. It's a great personal look into the mind of Aleister Crowley ,during the zeitgeist of the early 1920s.It was written after his torpid recovery,and before his Tunisian travels and well before his legal battles began.Many people might think this is a pro-drug book,yet,they must read it first.It's about his slippery slope downward and the final enlightening redemption ,at the end of the lifting tunnel out. With still all the recreational drug problems ,of another young generation of people,this book remains largely and sadly forgotten.It should be required high school reading,for health class, english class or sociology class."
5,Diary of a Drug Fiend- a literary master piece,"Aleister Crowley's Diary of a Drug Fiend is an excellent account of two cocaine addicts progression from innocence into addiction's deepest hells, and salvation through the will. A true story, you are taken along each step of the way by one of two narrators, Peter or Lou Pendragon, from their meeting, to their ""cocaine honeymoon,"" to their heroin addiction, and, at last, their defying the medical beliefs of a post Victorian Europe by breaking addiction without the help of a medical facility.I strongly recommend this book to anyone suffering from addiction of any sort, as well as people open minded enough to truly appreciate what Crowley has to say. I would also recommend it to students of the occult, as it serves as an excellent introduction to the Doctrine of Thelema."
5,Crowley's best work of fiction,"This book is fantastic. It's written in a clear, unassuming style that perfectly suites the novel's racy, drug crazed ambience. It's obvious the author knew his subject intimately, as the descriptions of the drug experience are both vivid and personal. And unlike Crowley's other novel, Moonchild, the author never looses sight of his plot and character development here by sidetracking his readers with arrogant lectures.The last section of the novel, where the addicts are cured of their drug habit via Magick and True Will, does spoil things a bit. It left me with the impression that Crowley used the novel merely as a way of conveying his spiritual beliefs. But this section in itself is fascinating and in no way interferes with the overall thrust of the novel. Great stuff."
1,kindle version is incomplete,"I bought this for my kindle. I was getting completely engrossed by Crowley's prose when the thing just ended. I think it was one chapter. It was not a sample, it just isnt the complete book for some reason. Dont buy it."
4,Cocaine is a horror.,"""Diary of a Drug Fiend"" is a must for anyone suffering from cocaine addiction. This book possesses the power to inspire users to 'hold on' to life, in spite of the horrors cocaine has instilled in their brain. I recommend this book to anyone contemplating ""experimenting"" with cocaine; ""Diary of a Drug Fiend"" will nauseate you and destroy any fallacies or fantasies you may be entertaining concerning cocaine use. Books like this need to be read to destroy cocaine's allure to help obliterate cocaine experimentation."
2,Good book. But no sample project download as they declared...,"The book is very good, it provides a big picture of all the aspects of Enterprise .NET application architecture design and development. At the end of this book, it says:"" To download the complete test application, please visit www.apress.com"", I realized that I might never be able to download the code. And when I went to apress.com, it just proved what I thought was not wrong: I just couldn't download the sample test project code at all: ""404 Error. The requested page is not available.""I seriously doubt they have a sample project to download as they said."
2,evan olson- one room,"first let me say i have the respect for evan in that he is one heck of a musician. that being said, he is not much of a songwriter. the songs bounce in between weak and downright silly. Horrible lyrics about ""one night flings"" and ""g strings"" make this album unlistenable. it sounds great but there is no substance behind the music. great for teenage girls who don't require depth from their tunes."
4,Before the rock god era,"Back when punk WAS political and crossover was punk/metal not rock/rap COC graced us with a fine EP of hardcore ideology. Perhaps it was the very scientists they feared in the Technocracy that drugged them and caused their downfall resulting in the ""corrosion of conformity"" from 1991 on that sounds like lynyrd skynyrd crossed with nirvana."
1,punk sounding not COC,"I was looking up the worst LP's I ever heard just for fun. I can't believe how many of the LP's get high ratings. Only about 1 percent of the CD's get a 1 rating from me, this one got a 1 which is to say it was hard to listen to the hole thing. I like the band but this was just bad."
2,no labels,"""Animosity was interesting (as is Techncracy) but the best work was by C.O.C.'s sister band ""No Labels"" which shared musicians (Woody Weatherman and Reed Mullin) with them. No Labels was also the greatest Raleigh punk band. It was very ironic to see C.O.C. rise to stardom while No Labels passed into oblivion.""what a load of steaming poo. no labels was a sloppy generic hardcore band and they sounded exactly like all of the other sloppy generic hardcore bands from the early 80s who were all basically a bunch of uncreative nitwit kids who thought black flag was the second coming of jesus. but as the no core tape proves, coc was ALWAYS superior to no labels. dont let this stuck up elitist fool you"
1,Not worth it.....,"Bought this because i was looking for a GOOD eyeliner, which i have yet to find.... I liked the idea that it came with a sharpner and i liked the color. I asked the clinique lady for an eyeliner that wouldnt run and she looked at me funny, and said ""well....we have this..."" and handed me the eyeliner. I should have just walked away because the look in her eye I could tell something was NOT right. I bought it anyway- i honestly hate this product and its not worth the price. ive tried cheap drugstore eyeliners that have worked way better than this 20 pencil! It WILL run...smears terribly. Once applied do not touch ur eye. Within an hour it will smear so if u purchase carry around tissues to keep your eyes clean so you wont look like a racoon. Sharpness doesnt last long. Its kinda a nuscience to have to sharpen every day. I dont reccomend. Go to the dollarstore and get a better product for cheaper too."
3,Mmm... So so,"Not quite what I expected... I get ""racoon eyes"" few minutes after putting it on. It just doesn't stay in place."
5,Excelente Producto,"Buen delineador, no provoca alergias, y es duradero.- El producto llegó a buen tiempo, hasta mi Pais.- Incluye sacapunta en la tapa, es cremoso,"
5,Vintage adorable bird book!,"This is such a charmer, with old-fashioned prints of the original show-type ideal birds, and tons of personal experience raising and breeding Canaries, etc. Says it includes: Parakeets, Love Birds, Finches, Parrots, Mules and Hybrids. Also has dozens of more, such as various finches, and even wild birds like the goldfinch. This has old-time breeder advice that you can't learn overnight! There is quite a lot of info and sometimes anecdotes on each page.Very rare. Isn't the cover great? Great deal, recommended."
4,Can't have everything,"Fortunately I got it only for the content, which is excellent. Too bad it comes in a cheesy cardboard case."
3,Glenn Gould Live,"It is in black & white recorded in the '50, it cover the period where Glenn recorded the Bach Italian Concerto. It have a focus in Glenn's live, contrasting with The Alchemist which show us a Internal Glenn, without fears of tell to the world its opinions."
5,Odds are you'll love this book,"First, readers of these reviews should be aware that Dan Dugan has made a profession of his near-fanatical opposition to Waldorf education. If he had read this book, he would have found that it integrates many educational perspectives, including Montessori, Paul Goodman, Carl Rogers, Robert Cole, John Holt, Rahima Baldwin, parent-teacher coops, home-schooling, etc. One of the contributors to the book is the editor of the Educational Review.In my opinion this book is exquisitely designed, full of heart, and manifestly dedicated to opening a ground where adults and children can meet and learn from each other."
5,A deceptively simple prose style covering great depths,"Cather's A PROFESSOR'S HOUSE is very different from the spirit-of-the-prairie book she's often so immediately associated with. Like O PIONEERS! and MY ANTONIA, however, this novel exhibits cather's great fascination with the American landscape, and with he posiibility of dreams left both fulfilled and unfulfilled. The experiences of Tom Outland in the Cliff City have made this book a recent favorite with Americanist scholars, but no less compelling is her portrait of a suddenly wealthy Midwestern academic family in the Twenties whose recent good fortune has begun to tear them apart despite their general good will and kind tempers."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS EDITION!,"I needed this for a class and thought I'd save myself a few bucks by getting this edition; I was pleasantly surprised by how cheap it was, but you get what you pay for. It is loaded with typos and editing and formatting errors. The straw that broke the camel's back came when I encountered-- without explanation-- a several-page section of the book printed twice in a row. This leads me to fear that some parts may have actually been left out! Not sure what the deal is, or why this is so carelessly printed. I imagine that the copyright expired and the publishers payed some undergraduate to transcribe an older version into a Microsoft Word document which they printed in cheap paperback without going over it beforehand. If you're considering buying it, don't. The inconvenience and unreliability is not worth saving several dollars. (Please note: this is NOT a substantive review of the novel itself, just a heads up about this particular edition.)"
1,The Professor's House,"The book itself was quite good. The edition from this publisher was a disgrace to the world of publishing. All diacritics (accent grave, tildas, etc.) were replaced with random ASCII characters. The numbered chapters from earlier printed versions were omitted. At one point, 10 pages were just repeated. I read this for my book club and based on the conversations in that group, and comparisons with other editions, I'm not even sure that all of the original text was present. I will never knowingly buy anything else from this publisher. And as a Virginian, I'm embarrassed that they make their home in my state. Caveat emptor!"
1,Do not buy THIS VERSION.,"The novel itself is marvelous, but this edition is horrendous:1. The format is completely unreadable. There are no chapters or dividers or anything, which takes away from the reading experience in the ""real"" novel.2. It is not edited! There are multiple spelling/grammatical mistakes, and there is one section that is printed twice.I really think this version is pirated. Do not buy it. It ruins the book."
1,Horrible Print (Wilder Publications edition),"Great book, but avoid the Wilder Publications edition. Not only does it contain excessive typos, but it is missing the epigraph and chapter breaks/titles. I got this book for a class, and it was virtually impossible to follow along with any of the other editions."
1,EDITION IS PROBLEMATIC,While the product arrived on time and in excellent condition the actual edition of the book is a terrible choice. Not only were there an outrageous amount of typos but some of the pages were actual reprints of previous pages. This made it a difficult text to read.
4,Memorable characters,"This is the first book by Cather that I have read and I'm glad that I did. It is so beautifully written that one could feel as though they have been gently placed within the walls of the professor's house. Cather included so many characters, at times it was hard to keep up with the names and personalities. However, to take away any one of the characters would have taken away from this great read."
1,Great Novel - Terrible Edition,"As much as I loved reading this novel, I can't stand this edition. The publisher seems to have written the text in about three minutes flat: ""your"" becomes ""you"", ""my"" becomes ""me"" (except during Henry's dialogue - then it's supposed to happen). There are also a large amount of accented letters ( like ""é"") that ended up being something like """" which makes reading words as simple as ""Opéra"" very difficult as it now reads ""Opra"". The publisher didn't even bother to put in the standard chapters that other editions have, which leaves you reading approximately 89 pages without any place to rest the eyes. PLEASE get yourself a different edition: one preferably not from this publisher. A simple publisher's mistake should not detract from such a marvelous text."
5,On aging and acceptance,"Lately, I've turned away from fiction, because I haven't been able to find works that keep me turning those pages. When I stumbled across The Professor's House, I was delighted to find myself swept away and completely absorbed by Willa Cather's tender and disturbing tale of an ordinary man's confrontation with his feelings about place, family, and ageing. The professor's realization that he might have to forfeit the passion and vivacity he experienced in his youth and compromise with a ""life without joy"" was very poignant and provoking. Cather's prose is intelligent, but fluid and concise. I think it will go on my list of a dozen or more most memorable novels."
1,Do not buy this edition.,"This review is about the edition, not the book.I made the mistake of ordering this edition for my class, thinking to save them money. Now I have no idea how I'm going to keep them on the same page (and I mean that quite literally). The Wilder edition is full of misprints and errors. An entire chapter is repeated twice! The editing is so incompetent that it makes the book painful to read.The novel itself is wonderful, but please give your money to a more responsible publisher."
3,The Professor's House,"There is a good reason why this book never became one of Cather's popular ones. It is difficult to understand what point or points are being made. The ending left us quite hanging, also."
1,Bailed Out!,Jane Everett and Cash Langley argue from sunup to sundown! Hurry and find a copy of Lyn Cote's story if this type of behavior is a turn-on . . .MaryGrace Meloche
4,Good But Needs an Audience,"Mindi and her band play the tunes quite well and appear to be having fun. They are playing in a club with no crowd there. That causes it to lack a little energy. If you are a Mindi Abair fan, buy this. It sounds good and looks good and is a good example of how smooth jazz is better live. It just needs an audience."
2,Over the top horror,"In 1988, on Oct. 30, was the day I first heard this album. It is now forever linked to not only great punk rock for me, but forever linked to my teen-age halloween memories. Nearly 20 years after I first heard it, and 20 years since its release, 'Horror Epics' still remains one of the great 80's punk albums and the only political/ghoul punk album I can think of. It's a great way to start your Exploited collection and a must for a curent collection."
2,Shambhala Dance-,"This CD has only one good song on it. Otherwise, it is very difficult to listen to."
4,great shoe and value,"What else to say? Good value for this decent brand. Comfortable and true to size. Flawless delivery, too."
2,Great customer service but very poor product,"Just to get to the point, my problem with the shoe is that the leather seeps in water. When it rains or snows, the leather gets soaked and in no time, my feet starts to feel wet. This mostly happens at the front of the shoe where the leather meets the sole. At first I thought that the shoe I got was just a lemon. Distraught, I called the Clarks customer care service and they sent me a new pair of the same shoe without any hassle. But alas, after the first day of rain, my feet were soaked again. I am compelled to say that this line of Clarks is just poorly made. Don't buy this shoe if you plan on being outside in them on a regular basis."
4,Low impact and comfort.,"I purchased this pair of Clark's shoes for a two week vacation through Eastern Europe. They were a very good choice indeed. They were low impact and really comfortable due to the high quality insoles, medium grade leather and great construction. This pair of shoes took me from Prag in the Czech Republic, Minsk Belarus, Riga Latvia, Kiev Ukraine and then to Milan Italy. I have only one reservation about this shoe. They squeek like rubber duckies due to the soft plastic like inserts under your heals. This is a top notch stylish product. Don't pass them up.Alan Light"
3,"Good shoe, but not great","I swear by Clarks, and that is all I buy any more. However this shoe has a thin heel with no padding there and caused a blister on my heel. Very good sole and well made but I had to add buy some extra padding to the heal. Maybe your foot will fit better, but for me it was not the best Clarks as to offer."
5,Clarks Portland Oxford,"I've been buying the same Oxford shoe for years. If you want a good walking shoe that is comfortable and looks good the Portland Oxford is the one you want. I wear the heals out after a year but I walk about 7 miles a day in all types of weather (rain, snow...etc). The only thing I don't like is they are made in Vietnam, I wish they made them in the USA."
4,Heavy shoe,"It is comfortable, great for outdoor. But it is a little biger than its size. And overall the shoe is quite heavy."
4,"Comfortable, run big","My husband says these are comfortable, but is a little less enthusiastic about them than the other Clark's I've bought him. I purchased three pairs of Clarks at the same time, all on sale, and the other two fit better while this pair ran a little large. He wears them, but not very often, because they feel too big."
4,Excellent value,"Very comfortable. Light weight, water resistant. I ordered the extra wide. It's a bit wider than the normal W size. I should order the regular one instead. Overall, it's very good."
4,Comfortable walking shoe,"I bought almost the exact same Clark's shoe years ago, It lasted forever until the outside soles finally wore down. The upper body is still ok.Its comfortable and sturdy with a good fit. Good price as well."
2,"A Yard Shoe, at Best","My pair of Clarks arrived last week. When I took the shoes out of the box, I wasn't sure if I had ordered a pair of shoes (like I thought) or a cut-down version of a boot. I went back and looked at the picture on-line and, sure enough, I got what I ordered. This will be the last time I buy shoes without actually seeing and trying on the particular shoe. With the four eyelets, this shoe rides too high for a truly comfortable fit, plus it looks goofy. The leather, if it really is leather, looks fake. I would never wear these shoes to work or to a function where style mattered. I also would never wear these shoes with jeans (if you do, wear white socks so everyone will know you really are a geek). All in all, I give the product a 2. I would send them back, but it's not worth the bother. Instead, I'll wear'em when I work in the yard."
5,"Clarks Men's Portland Oxford, Brown Leather, 6.5 M","Clarks shoes are the best, stylish, comfortable, fashionable, for any occasion. used for all types of terrain and climate. my husband prefers all the features mentioned above. I recommend it. thank you very much"
2,Mixed review,"These shoes seem to be well constructed, but they are not like the Clarks that I bought 20 years ago. I bought them about 3 months ago, and I wear them 3 or 4 days a week.1) They've lost most of the cushy feel that they had when they are new.2) They have an unusual smell that reminds me of band-aids. I had originally thought that the odor would fade, but it has not. I can smell them all of the time, when they are within 6 feet of my person.If it were possible to return them at this point, I would."
2,Clark Oxfords,They are very average shoes. Please don't buy them thinking they are better than any quality shoe on the market. Go to a Vasque dealer and get better shoes.
1,BEWARE OF BROWN COLOUR- IT IS DARK AND UGLY !!! LOST MY MONEY,BROWN LEATHER - COLOR - BEWARE !!! IT IS DARK AND UGLY.I bought this in Brown leather last month and got that shipped to Kuwait.The brown color that looks great in the website picture is TOTALLY UGLY AND UNIMAGINABLY DARK AND UNACCEPTABLE.I am not using the shoes at all.Not in a position either to Ship that back to the US and get a replacement becausethat costs me more than the price of the shoe.James
1,Too Bad I Wore the Old Pair Out. New Ones are Awful,"So happy to see this style still available. My current pair is at least 10 years old and it's time to order another pair. These shoes are amazing walking shoes and while I don't wear mine a lot at home, I wouldn't be caught dead without them on a trip to a walking city such as NY or SF. I can walk 10 miles per day in these shoes and they're as comfy as going barefoot. Highest recommendation!Update: Finally started putting some miles on the new pair and they're HORRIBLE! I feel like someone has whacked the balls of my feet with a blunt instrument. I've added cushioning products and while they help, the pain is still there. These new shoes are not the high quality Clark shoes I've purchased in the past."
5,Perfect and comfortable for work,"I like them. They are a little dorky looking but perfect for work. Very comfortable and great price, i recieved them on the earliest possible date, which was great!"
4,Clarks Portlands - Well made comfort shoe,"Well made comfort shoesLike- Thick soft leather. Does not require wearing in- Very comfortable. Fits like a glove on day one- rubber sole has very good grip- leather is breathable- non leather material around collar makes it very comfortable for long walks. Good design.- leather is darker than pic. makes it suitable for business casual. Looks very good with jeansDislike- rubber on the heel has a very very slight hardness to it if you tend to land hard on your heel when you walk. Suspect because of the extra thick rubber padding at the heel for added durability- front design of shoe is a little flat and old school - retro ""grandpa shoes"" ;-0ConclusionThis shoe runs half size big I think. Typical Clarks. I purposely bought my usual size so that I can add in an extra insole. It fits perfectly even with the insole.One of the most comfortable shoes I've ever bought. Great Clarks design and quality."
1,Horrible Knock-Off Filmed in Basically Back-Yard Locations,"I usually never do film reviews, just military book reviews. But this movie was so lousy and was so amateur, yet had the big budget look on the cover and blog sites, so it suckered me into renting it. Obviously was made to take advantage of the genre. Some knock-offs can be funny and standout, but I WARN YOU, THIS BITES! Poor acting, poor script, poor locations (just the warehouse with empty boxes...freshly painted, and a gas station).....the only glimmer was the Asian girl. Hope she doesn't kill her career with another one of these $300 budget movies. It just makes me mad when I get suckered for $4 and a soar thumb from fast forwarding.....I think the previous reviewers who gave it multiple stars were from the same company that threw this thing together....it doesn't even rate 1."
5,nice watch,"I like the Fossil removable links, so I can size my watch without a jeweler. I like the water resistancy, so that I can shower without worry. I like the sleek look.I sometimes have a hard time with viewing the face. Perhaps if the background weren't blue it would be easier, but the glare hides the hands. It generally takes me a bit to figure out what my watch says because of this."
4,Works great on easy dirt.,Sometimes falls short on oily dirt in the nooks and crannies.Def. worth $50 though.
3,E-fortune Ultrasonic Cleaner,"Seems to do the job on my wife's jewelry, my coins, dirty CD's & DVD's.You should use distilled or reverse-osmosis water & a squirt of detergent to get the best results. I would give it 4 or 5 stars if it operated quietly. It doesnt. It makes a loud, raspy buzzing noisewhile it works, so use it somewhere you cant hear it, like the garage!"
1,Product attributes are NOT what is described,"eFortune promotes this unit as a 60 watt 1400ml capacity cleaner. I specifically purchased this unit because it was supposed to be an upgrade in power from the unit I was using. When it arrived, the unit has a label underneath which lists it as only 50 watts of power and only 1000ml capacity. These units are being mis-represented, and you are paying more for it over the slightly less powered units for sale."
1,Product Not Well Made,"First machine didn't function but a few seconds at a time. Replacement from seller three weeks ago works, but so poorly produced that already the plastic case has cracked from the vibrations. Cleaner has not been moved around nor bumped. For the price, it definitely should have held together more than a three weeks! I wish I had spent $20-$30 more and bought the fully stainless steel professional machine."
5,Best and rarest of stylistics albums,"I haven't listened to this album in more than 25 years. My partners and I would sit in our college dorm rooms, crooning and swooning to the superior lyrics, that painted tales of love, joy, and pain.I regret that the CD is so costly, but it is worth the price. Songs like ""Payback is a Dog"" (Dog, it's a dog), evoke longings of simpler lyrics and loves.A must buy for Stylistics fans."
2,Not worth the money,"I had read much about royal honey, how it gives you energy and improves your immune system. I don't know about the immunity issue, but I was buying it hoping for more energy. This product didn't give me any extra energy and it was kind of expensive as well. I'd say just use regular honey."
5,Needed a fork I could use with my non-stick pans! Perfect!,Needed a fork for my non-stick pans. This does the trick for what I needed.
1,Useless Fork,"If someone could please tell what this is useful for, I'd be grateful. It doesn't even deserve one star."
1,Not as expected,"This utensil is too long, thick and bulky. The tines are too thick to adequately grab thinner foods such as bacon. Disappointing."
4,As advertised,"This fork is great for working with non-stick pans. It is light, but sturdy. I would recommend it to my family and friends."
3,This Fork Is Huge,"I've had an old nylon fork for years. It's getting pretty beat up. I use it for scrambled eggs, whisking gravy, etc. I've been looking for a long time for a replacement.Unfortunately, this is not the replacement. This fork is literally huge. It is a bit small for a barbecue fork, but way too big for on the stove. When I first got it, I laid it on the counter next to the old one, and it is at least 3 inches longer and quite ""beefy"".I resolved after spending so much money on a plastic fork, to give it a fair try. I've now used it several times, but have pretty much gone back to the old one. This fork is just so BIG that it is very awkward to use. It does get the job done, but what can I say? It just doesn't FEEL right.So, in closing, there is nothing wrong with the fork. It works and does what it is supposed to, just beware that it is much bigger than it looks in the pictures."
3,Somewhat Disappointed in the Content,"After reading the rave reviews by others about how Froug tells you to follow your guts, I found maybe two lines in the whole book about following your instincts, and there is NO mention of Zen principles at all in the book. I found the ""hype"" about the book and the actual content somewhat misleading. The book does give a few clues about structure, following the same old tired format that every other screenwriting book does.What salvaged the book for me was the excellent"
2,Not really about Zen at all.,"I thought that this book was going to be about getting in touch with your own creativity. It wasn't. It was basically a book about ""tricks and tips of the trade."" That has its uses too,but it wasn't what I was looking for. The title of this book is so misleading that I feel I did not get my money's worth. I would highly recommend ""Writing from the inside out"" instead. Sometimes you have to go through several books before you find one that really is useful. ..."
4,Good costume version of the Drizzt sword.,This sword is a spot on replica of the art work from the Drizzt books.
2,Sound Quality is extremely good,"amazon DOES NOT SUPPLY CLOSED CAPTIONING WITH ITS TV SERIES.For that reason, clear and understandable voice quality is essential to enjoying a purchased series.Seasons one and two are about 95% understandable. Season 3, to my ears, is about 90%.Also, of course, the mix of characters and situations produces compelling drama every day of the week.I have good hearing in one ear, so, Amazon, I manage without closed captioning. I *do* avoid buying TV series that have poor sound quality.Now if only people who are deaf in both ears could ""hear"" the series, with closed captioning, all would be fine."
4,Who watches the (over)watchmen?,A body theft that ends in murder in the Morgue draws the attention of the OSP when the stolen corpse is found to have been tagged by a US Navy tracking compound called Overwatch. Things take a deadly turn when Canadian smugglers steal 4 containers of Radioactive Pharmaceuticals and plan to sell them to terrorists.
5,NCIS second season,I really enjoyed second season however I was not pleased thsat I was sent a defective DVD set and was not able to view the whole series. However I was refunded the purchase price and I will try ordering it again .
3,problems solved.,I bought this as a gift for my daughter who lives in another state. When she received it all of the cds skipped. When I called amazon cs. They solved the problem for me. now my daughter is enjoying her present.
2,Series becomes a vehicle for the regular depiction of gun violence,"I was frankly appalled by the second season of NCIS LA. I had enjoyed the first season on blu-ray, and bought the second (on dvd, because blu-ray was not available). Unfortunately, instead of actual police drama and case-solving, each episode has now become a vehicle for building up to the main characters gunning down large numbers of people, instead of orderly crime solving and appropriate action as a result. The contrast between the nicey-nice depictions of the attractive-by-design characters and their death-squad behavior is something I find jarring and inappropriate. I'm gone from being a fan of this show, or ever watching or buying it again."
5,Turned up fun and action..,As always I love Chris O'Donnell and LL Cool J. The really revealing character here is Mr. Deeks Eric Olsen and Daniela Ruah. They are such a funny combination and they look very good as a couple. Hats off to Ms. Hunt as well. She is a very convincing agent because of her size and looks nobody will look twice or even once that she has license to kill. GREAT SHOW MORE SEASON IS A MUST.
4,Great Program,"I really have enjoyed every the NCIS LA seasons. Not quite as much as NCIS, but I do enjoy how well the show has deveoped"
4,question,I want the entire 2nd season on DVD but the product package says only one disc. Does this mean there are missing episodes? Or only synopses? Help?
1,flash drive,"Terrible product, malfunction at first use and had to deal with returning it twice. Finally got refund thanks to amazon's policy."
5,Great purchase!,I was extremely pleased wth the Lenox Holiday 12 piece set purchase! It was definitely a great buy in that I did some comparative shopping and found the Amazon price to be the least expensive. The set looks elegant and will certainly add to the holiday table.
5,He is fantastic!,"Quality of music from mp3 download is perfect and having it available on the cloud player is a great way for me to ""carry"" it across multiple mobile platforms to hear it wherever I desire."
2,A bit disapointed,"I'm not satisfied with velcro on these takabichi, after bruising my arm I took them to a sewing proffessional and had him install elastic material. Not practical for weapons concealment nor as a kimono tightener. I'd rather recommend kyahans instead for a ninjutsu practicioner. I think they are overpriced as well."
2,looks nice,"While this bench really DOES look nice, it is a bit flimsy. The legs are wobbly, if you sit on the bench."
1,Grand Prix MAP sensor,"Everything seemed good. Good price, ease of delivery/order. Installation was simple. I choose to purchase a Delphi rather than AC Delco to save a few bucks. That was a real mistake. The Delphi part failed in less than a year. Now I have to replace the sensor. And you can bet it won't be Delphi!!!! But Amazon has performed as expected"
3,Different than LP release,"Just as the previous reviewer states, this CD issue contains the full original release, with ""Sugar Island"" and the single ""House of the King"". The running order and cover picture are different however. Also, the latter track was re-recorded for Focus 3."
2,why dream about da foo-cha,"not a bad album some songs are a bit cheesy and,but ranks well with tull and the like .....give it a go"
5,Love this Series,The second season is excellent. It builds on the plot from the first season. I watched the second season in two days I could not turn it off. I highly recommend this series.....and season three is even better.
4,Great Series,"Don't let the name fool you. I was skeptical at first, but Julianne Margolies (spelling?) is fabulous. This show does a great job exploring some of the motivational factors that influence a decision to stay or terminate a marriage in the face of infidelity. It explores the family stress and impacts, especially since that ""cheater"" is a public figure. The martial and family story aside, it also offers a pretty compelling legal drama. I am a fan of Law and Order, and though this show lives more on the legal side than in the law enforcement the cases are compelling, draw from current events, and leave you sometimes questioning our legal system."
1,Awful video duplication quality kills a great season.,"I thoroughly enjoyed the first season on DVD and was looking forward to seeing how things developed in year 2. Unfortunately, CBS DVD allowed Good Wife Season 2 go to the disk duplication plant with a set of video masters that look like someone had boot-legged them off a low-bandwidth channel of YouTube. And the problem isn't just in one or two episodes. The abysmal video quality ruins your viewing pleasure for all six (count em, six!) disks. Season Two brings great new story lines for Alicia, Kalinda, Will and company yet I find myself constantly distracted by the fuzziness and pixelated image quality. If these flaws weren't baked right into the brand new shrink-wrapped product, I'd have sent it back immediately. What a disappointment!"
5,Love this show!,"We love this show! We could not find this any cheaper anywhere else. It also is not available for instant viewing on Netflix (and who wants to watch 4 episodes and then wait for days for the others?), we also couldn't find it in video stores. I think it's a good idea to buy it :)"
5,EVEN BETTER THAN THE FIRST SEASON,"I am totally addicted to this second season. Excellent show, excellent season. I try to slow down to savour each episode."
2,POOR DISK QUALITY,The shows are great!!!!!!!. The disk quality is questionable . The first three played fine on my primary machine ---then the next three could not be read by the player. An older secondary player was able to play the remining disks. Quality control may be a thing of the past
1,very poor,"This season did not play all the way through....it kept skipping and there was nothing on the disk. some of the shows would play and some of them would not, so we ended up missing a huge part of what is going on.I would not buy from this buyer if you like watching all of the shows."
1,Pay for free tv????,I find it appalling that I must pay to watch shows that have already aired on free tv! Yet another way Corporate America is sucking our $ from us!!
4,"Second was not as good as the first season, but this company delivered fine.","Product arrived on time, shrink wrapped, only the final disk had a little glitch on it -it skipped & skipped, had to fast forward a few scenes, but got the gist of the show which wasn't as good as the first season in my opinion anyhow, but the first was so good, it's hard to equal or beat that."
2,"Great show, TERRIBLE disc quality","This is not a review about the show, the actors, or the storyline. All of those would earn 5+ stars. However, on each of the discs in the Second Series, the video is breaking up, stopping, or skipping ahead. We had to purchase a Skip Dr CD/DVD Repair kit and while that is taking care of part of the problems, you can still tell the disc and/or recording quality is not 100%.We were enjoying Season One so much we ordered Season Two months before we could get to it. That meant we did not know about the faulty quality until about a month ago. Because the window to get a replacement expired in August, we have to live with the bad quality disc. Yes, all other DVDs are playing just fine. So it is not our equipment that is at fault. Very disappointing."
5,Good Series,I missed this show in its first broadcast and have become hooked. The DVD includes complete shows and provides a lot of information about the characters and their backgrounds. Don't really care about the meagre add-ons. I like gag reels and there wasn't one.
5,"Believable, pacy, satisfying ....","I LOVE IT! This must rate as one of the best legal dramas we've had for a long time. The issues raised, the interplay between characters, the realism... kudos to writers, actors and director(s). Satisfying. Very satisfying :-)"
3,Great show!,"We bought this second hand to save some bucks, and did save big time. Shipped quick. The only problem was that it skipped during one episode. we got over it. The show is extremly compelling a great way to watch a series. We are hooked on The Good Wife. We are also hooked on watching a Series after its over. No Commercials and you can just watch one after another. I highly recommend this series and ordering the used copy."
3,unable to review,"unfortunately I have not been able to review season two -season one was great - due to geographical restrictions. I am living in Brazil anfd cannot download the Good Wife season two even I bought it last month. However, I am interested in reviewing the series so maybe you can send me a hard copy."
2,Doesn't come near earlier seasons,"Very disappointed in this series third season -- not enough guts, too much sex. What happened to the integrity of the characters?"
2,"great show, poor HDTV playback","Fans of the first season will not be disappointed with the story content here--BUT, after having purchased SEASON ONE and being very satisfied with the DVD quality on my 50"" HDTV, SEASON 2 is a major disappointment in its picture playback quality. Jagged fuzzy edges abound on my 50"" and my 42"" TVs( although the smaller set is a bit more watchable because the pixels are obviously tighter meaning that if you have a 32"" or smaller set it may not necessarily bother you) It does play fine on my one remaining picture tube TV which obviously means the Season 2 DVD set was NOT manufactured for HDTVs as opposed to its predecessor. Too bad--it will make me think twice about buying SEASON 3 ( or any other new CBS-TV DVD sets) until I hear or read other reviews."
3,Only Spanish subs?,"I was looking forward to this, but it only has Spanish subs. The first season had English subs as well."
1,Not as advertised,Item does not charge the elf 200S cannon power shot digital camera battery when it is advertised as capable of doing so
3,It's Flora,The performance is still stuck in the mid-70's jazz-rock fusion. Flora has a great voice and could do so much more than this
5,Why not get the best!!,Starrett is the gold standard of precision measuring instruments. You will never be disappointed with the quality of this instrument.
1,Falsely stated,"I ordered this item because it is advertised as suited for the Axim x30. It isn't. In fact, the packaging itself says X3. So I have now two completely useless batteries that I paid more in shipping for than they themselves cost.The line - Hitech - Replacement X1111 PDA battery for Dell Axim X3, X3i, X30 PDAsimply isn't true."
3,Worked but bulky,"Decided to get a Motorola Droid shortly after I bought this, so the Dell PDA never gets used anymore. Nothing wrong with the battery, just wish I didn't waste the money on a battery I didn't use.If you want to buy it from me, let me know."
4,just what I wanted,Shipping was fast and the battery works perfect. All in all it was a simple/efficient transaction.
2,It was just ok,"I dont know what all the other reviewers were raving about. I generously applied this product to my face and while it did feel amazing it didnt suck out all the blackheads as other reviews had stated. My pores did look a little smaller though once I washed it off and my skin was really soft. I felt absolutely no tingling, stinging or burning like some of the other reviewers and it took about 45 minutes to fully harden which is about average for products of this nature. I dont regret buying it, but I probably wouldnt buy it again."
2,Disappointed,"The musical transfer was poorly made. It sounds like they tranferred it from a cassette player, the voice is basically alone, the instruments are not clear, muddled, lacks fullness, conviction? The recording reminds me of when the cd's started back in the 80's. The songs don't make you want to rehear the cd. The best track is America the beautiful. Does he have any other recording of ""America the Beautiful""?"
3,Ray Charles CD,"Although Ray's music is great and timeless, this particular CD was scratchy and not very entertaining."
5,Ray Charles,I gave this to my husband for a Christmas gift and he absoultely loved it. This is his favorite version of America the Beautiful. I have searched for a long time and I finally found it. I listened to the CD myself and I really enjoyed it also. I would recommend it to everyone.
1,DAMAGED CD,"This music CD came to me opened with the CD scratched. CD case looks very worn out. No packing slip, no security plastic wrapping on the case either (like when you buy music in the store). This is the second CD I received that came to me like this. I will never order music from Amazon again"
5,"THIS GAME IS #1 . I KNOW GAMES, AND THIS IS A REAL GOOD GAME","This game is awesome, you can drive hot sports cars to rusty garbage trucks. The graphics are outstanding, the control is sort of like Max Payne. You can chose varity of weapons like the Pistol,Machine Gun and more. These missions are challenging-SO PREPARE YOUR SELF TO DRIVE-"
2,Oh well...,i should of listened. i would give the free ride a 2 out of 5 and the story mode a 3 1/2. its not as good as i expected. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! especially if your a kid who rarely gets money and rarely buys games. save your money and reserve a copy of grand theft auto san andreas. Never before have i ever been more anxious about a game more than grand theft auto and it has always been as good as i expected. read more about my review on grand theft auto san andreas titled i cant wait by jacob from somewhere.
2,Not Impressed,"After Playing the for the first two of the series, I didn't feel like the game had improved at all, it felt like I was playing the old games again and those were on PS1, granted the graphics are a little better but the physics are annoying, I know it is a lot harder to role a lamborghini than this game leads you to belive and to top it off the cops are faster than the ferrari and the lamborghini."
5,you are the wheelman!!!!!,i love and own all the driver games and this one takes the cake and the frosting too..this time you get to drive boats and motercycles which is fun....the only problem with this game is that after i play it and i drive my car it makes me want to run through stop signs and red lights at 100 miles an hour but hey thats not the games fault...
1,What?! No MULTIPLAYER?!,"I have been waiting for years for this game, because of the countless hours of intense fun Driver 2's Multiplayer ""Capture the Flag"" provided me and my friends. Everyone I have ever talked to about Driver 2 agrees: the real fun is in the Multiplayer, Split-Screen experience. Well, all my eager anticipation just deflated, when I read the new game won't offer this feature. I'm sure the graphics are great (shootouts, blah blah blah), but not worth sacrificing the game's greatest draw. Graphics be damned; I'll just stick with my old Driver 2."
1,Violence With Cars And Guns Like Grand Theft Auto Games,If you want a violent game that exposes your children to killographic material then get this but who wants that so dont get it because it'll make your kid violent and more aggresive! Get a quality E rated game if you want something for your children. I am a proud mamber of Mothers Against Videogame Violence!
4,DON'T BUY IT!,"Don't buy this game. Just rent the game from some where. Anybody can beat this game in 3 or 4 days. After that, the game will collect dust."
2,Driver Drove Me Crazy,"I'll keep it short, because I don't think this games warrants any more of my time. What a piece of junk! The controls stink and the graphics are terrible. I can't believe this is a PS2 game. Thankfully, I rented it...and returned it early. Blockbuster Video should be ashamed of having this garbage on their shelves, but they were probably mislead from the great commercials they saw on this product as well.I personally ensure I bash ""No One Lives Forever"" every time I write a review since that game really set the bar for crapness, but this one runs a close second. Save your gas money, stay away from Driver3."
4,Have not done much with it,"I picked up this game when it first came out and I guess I was expect something more. It was pretty much like the first nd second game but with new fetures like guns and slo-mo. The missions are difficult to do becuase of the funky mechanics but the driving games offer some fun times with the director mode. If your a fan of the series, you'll probably like it but otherwise, rent it first."
4,"Good, but not all it was cracked up to be.","Plain and simple, this is an awesome game but there are definately some very annoying parts in the game that bring it down to 4 stars for me in stead of 5. The worst part for me is the shooting technique. Maybe I am just too used to shooting with my mouse on PC games, however it still is a very fun game."
4,Pretty Good Game!,"driv3r is a pretty cool game. when i bought it, i spent all day just exploring. There is only about 3 or 4 bad things about it. one of them is some times the game freezes. also there is a few glitches in it, plus some of the missions are pretty tricky. There are lots of good things about it too, like the weapons are good, and the storyline is cool. All in all I give driv3r 4 stars."
4,best driver game by FAR,Ive played all the driver games and this one has the rest BEAT!!!the driving part is very cool and has a good feel.great selection of cars too.my only complaint is that the on-foot action is not as good as other gta type games go.there is no targeting aim and the character tanner looks and moves like Gumby.but over all this is a MUST HAVE for all shooting-driving gamers.
5,Excellent,I bought this and Stuntmans for my best friends son and when he comes over (almost everyday) he has to bring his games that I bought him. My son's are always fighting over the remote if he gets up to stretch or anything else. Now I have to buy them 1 or they are going to get it themselves. Which ever comes up w/ the money first .. Lol .. I highly Recommend this game.
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"Driver 3 is one of the worst games i have ever played. I wasted my money and life on this. At first it looked really appealing to me, but it didn't turn out so goo after that. The big problem this game had was it came out too late for its time. If this came out before gta III this would be flying off the shelves and would be a big hit and making gaming history, but it was a few years late, and that is what made it so boring and bad. To anyone who buys, rents or even thinks about this game, DON'T PLAY IT. it's not worth buying, renting, or thinking about it. It just wastes time."
3,GTA Killer?! I doubt that seriously....,From the moment. I started playing this game. I felt something wasnt right. From the insane glitches going in the game like for instance:cars blowing up with 2 cops next them and they dont die. They keep right on shooting me.to my car crashing into a pole and having the pole get stuck in the car with you in it.trying to get on a boat and getting sucked under the boat and dying.to very bad death animations like having a guy get shot and he flies up on the ceiling then comes back down and starts flopping in between a table and a couch.problems with timed missions. Your trying to get in the car but it takes several tries. I wouldnt care normally but during timed missions it is a big deal.These are just a few issues i've had with the game. Worth a rental perhaps but not 50 dollars no way!!
1,eWW,"This game stinx. Driving is enjoyable, trying to aim my gun and move at the same time just plain stinx."
3,i thought different but still good!,"when my mom first bought it it was 59.99$ but it was worth it cuz the damage is so realistic probally best realistic game ever to be honest. the sound sucks the graphics are top noch the gameplay is hard never really played the missions cuz its way too hard but still good cuz i used cheats to get all cars, ammo, and citys and its really fun when driving in what ever city running away from cops or just smashing into cars so i do recomend it but i think you will or wont like it its up too Ugameplay 8/10 its only good when you just drive around not doing missionsgraphics 10/10 really good and realisticsound 3/10 yawnnnn didnt feel the sound but cars are OK but not goodloading 5/10 its OK nothing goodoverall 5.1 its funn to me but might not to you"
2,This game SUCKS,This game SUCKS it's really hard to try and control the player. And the graphs look like it was meant for PS1. What the hell happened to it? It used to be good.
3,eh,"Havnt played games in a long time. I was surprised to see that they havnt got any better. If the cut scenes look better then the game itself then it doesnt make any sense to me. Though i had fun playing this game the only difficult stages of the game are due to errors in the game. Like trying to chase someone down but having your guy get stuck on something, etc... Seems all games are like this now. You can kill a boss in 5 seconds but it will take you 2 hrs to try and overcome a bug int he game.Like I said Im surprised at the lack of innovation in games. You'd think they'd be flawless by now. Ill give it another 5 yrs."
1,WHEN THE FCUK ARE THEY GOING TO RELEASE IT?,"This game was supposed to out so f*cking long ago. It is now past June 1, 2004 and the bloody game is not in my bloody hands. I'm blood ticked off!"
4,A guaranteed full 3 months of fun!,"Talk about bang for your buck. I'm stilling playing this thing months later.The awesome crash physics make this better than other gta wannabees. The story is very interesting although there are not that many missions. But still enough for you to enjoy again and again.I wish this game had more vehicles - there are about 10 in each of the 3 cities. And they are not real licensed vehicles. Also, the police are not that intelligent as they are in GTA.. always the same crashing psychos. And you never get arrested and sent to jail. The game simply ends at that point.You get to pilot boats too but, unfortunately, no airplanes or helicopters."
1,THIS GAME SUCKS ASS,WHEN I FIRST BOUGHT THE GAME THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FUN.BUT THE GAME PLAY IS SO STUPID. WHEN YOU BURNOUT PEOPLE START TO SCREAM AND RUNAWAY. COPS IS ALSO STUPID BECAUSE THEY JUST ARE STUPID. THE GRAPHICS IS KINDA GOOD BUT THE GAME BOY ADVANCE GRAPHICS IS WAY BETTER THAN THIS GRAPHICS. THEY SAID THAT EVERYTHING IS DESTRUCABLE BUT WHEN YOU HIT A POLE OR A BUILDING IT DOESNT EVEN BREAK OR SOMETHING. WHO EVA IS READING THIS RIGHT NOW DONT BUY THIS GAME CUZ IT SUCKS ASS!!!!!!!!
1,Not worth it,"This game was definately not worth the hype (If there was any). I remember seeing a commercial for it and I was thinking ""GTA ripoff"" and it pretty much is. GTA is alot better than this in everything, this game was to bland. I got bored with this really, really quick."
3,eeh,"i have been a hardcore fan of the driver series. i have all 3...anyway, not as fun as gta vice city. it is much harder and the controlls could have used a little work((my fav config is from ace combat 4) you dont have a roaming mode, like in gta, its just mission to mission, any you cant pick a mission like in the orig. driver. the &quot;world&quot; and &quot;driveing&quot; are much better, but no strippers, and not as much blood."
3,not all its cracked up to be,I saw previews and this game looked great and I rented it it's ok the shootouts suck so bad the driving is good there is a lot of glitches and there is no blood.
1,Should have read the AMAZON reviews,"I made the mistake of buying this game yesterday without researching enough. I thought it would be good enough to just get without checking into especially since I really liked Driver 1. I thought they were going to do a lot more this time around, but I was wrong.I give one star for the cool driving effects, nice engine sounds and car damage. Nothing else deserves a star.On-foot is terrible. Aiming is terrible. This game really is crappy. Very dissapointed."
4,Ok just rent it,Dont waste your money on this game after beating the levels this game is horrible. The Free run mode is not even fun the cops arn't even a challenge if you want a better game like this get Grand Theft Auto Vice city.
2,Rather Impossible,"Great Graphics, Great Sound, Great Music.. that is it. Game play SUCKS so far. Driving around is almost impossible to control. You can barely aim at anything. The second mission will drive you insane after awhile. They made the game TOO DIFFICULT. I think I will skip all Atari games after this I had such a bad experience. I love the sound and the graphics but the handling of the game will not let me enjoy it. I don't like repeating myself over and over again through the course of several days. It is definately not for the novice of for people with little patience. The only reason I got the game because, according to the advertisement, this is the series that inspired Grand Theft Auto. Please, I beg of you, do not get it because of that. Two totally different type of companies and two totally different type of playing experience. (...)"
2,Rent it before you buy it...,This game isn't that great. It does have great graphics but not as great as it was hyped up to be.
1,Buyer Beware!!!,I ordered this game from we_make_u_happy and never received it. I also emailed the company to try and resolve this matter only to hear nothing from them. Amazon needs to stop doing business with them immediately!
1,What a joke,"You've got to be kidding me? This is what you've come up with over the last couple of years? Game play is awful and clunky. Nothing smooth about this at all. The driving is horrible. Car's don't react that way and it feels as if the car nevers gets out of first gear. Shooting and aiming is dumb as hell. You get shot a few times before you can even aim at the guy you need to. Moving around is even worse. You have to use a combo of both analogs or 1 analog and the thumbpad in order to really see where you're going.Atari: Don't even go back to the drawing board. Burn the drawing board. Don't try to take an awful game and throw money at voice overs for characters on actors that people perceive to be cool. If you spent half of your talent (whatever there is of it) on the game rather then the animated sequences, you might have something worth 2 stars here. Until then I will never buy another Atari game again.Bottom line: This game sucks"
3,Short and silly,"THis game is to easy i beat it in a couple hours, the problem that i also saw was the physics of the cars, you can hit a curb straight on and get filed"
1,Bashing your head against a brick wall is more fun,"Reflections should be utterly ashamed of themselves with this flaming pile of excrement. It is repetitive, limited, glitchy and buggy. The chase missions merely serve to prolong the frustration, offering no opportunity for creativity in the way you tackle the game, and overall the whole limited universe of the Undercover mode is akin to Dragon's Lair or Space Ace. They had the excuse of being linked to a Laserdisc for gameplay; this title has no such excuses.Reflections may indulge in their little jokes about GTA, but really - Driv3r is the biggest joke of all. Do NOT buy this title. It is a real stinker. Buy GTA, and if you want something that stinks, buy Freak Out or something; at least it'll be a change."
5,Driv3r where have you been,"do get this game better than grand theft and max payen put together you get weapons,better cars,last but not least better graphics do get it the first day no time to waste"
2,The ups and downs of Driv3r,"Driver 3 is one of those sad cases whereas a game is produced of superb standard and longevity. Yet most good things can be dragged down kicking and screaming by one flaw. Driver 3 is a brilliant game, ruined to the point of frustration by it's difficulty. Many missions require days of wall punching, radiator kicking repetitive memory tests to complete. There is one mission: Tanners Escape where there is nothing but luck to aid you. It is this flaw that ruins Driver 3. If it were not for this Driver 3 would be a game of higher standard than that of Vice City, Metal Gear Solid 2. In short, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME."
4,waste of money,The graphics suck You can't watch the road while your driving because of the lame camera view the only thing you can see is the back of your car. The Veichle handling sucks and all you do is drive.I know its called driver but if you get weapons you should be able to use them and there are only about 3 missions where you are able to the game sucks don't blow your money wait for gta san andreas to come out
5,"Good game, but bad name!","my bro's friend bought Driver and he used to come over to play it like everyday in the summer. then we bought Driver2 when that came it out, and it was even better because u could steal other cars. NOW, Driv3r is coming out June 1, and i can't wait! i love the driver series cuz they are so fun to just wander around the city and crash into other cars. now there are better games to play, but not anymore. Driver is back boyz and u betta watch out!"
5,last autums dream,I purchased the lp in 1978 at a discount bin because i liked the cover. I truly made a great buy! it is one of the finest albums i have ever listened to there is nothing to compare jade warrior to 5star all the way
3,"It's ok, but not the true A.F.","Sorry fellas, some of you say that this is the real af, nah. Too metal for my taste and af is about hardcore. Only 4 guys to me are the real af...stigma, miret, kabula, colletti...for new people getting into af, stick with the victim in pain, cause for alarm, and something's gotta give..."
3,Good DVD but warner brothers...,"I love the theme, scooby,winter and Christmas. Great episodes but as usual Warner left out An Episode. Scooby-Doo Meets Laurel and Hardy has all the elements, winter,a snow ghost,Scooby singing jingle bells. It should have been included but of course wasn't. 3 stars only due to warners cheapness,other wise would have been 5. Come on Warners! I could do a better job marketing your Dvd's."
2,Stop Releasing Duplicate episodes!,"This DVD is OK, However Warner released That's snow Ghost again. They shouldn't have put that in creepiest capers. They could of put more episodes on the disc. It is nice to have the Christmas Special on it though. And I also liked how they mixed them up from all different years. They should of put another episode in Creepiest Capers and saved that's Snow Ghost in this winter one. That way Scooby-Fans could have more stories on DVD. I also didn't like the fact that it just ran into a cartoon with out the opening. They put a duplicate show on this disc and they cut off half of a Scooby & Scrappy Show. They showed 3 cartoons per half hour. I felt jipped and they shouldn't be charging this much for this disc. It should be [less expensive]"
5,If it's Scooby it's got to be good,It's halarious fun for everyone to watch. So pop the popcorn and get cold drinks and pile up for some side spliting Scooby Doo Where are you fun.
3,not like the original,this show was ok but they are nothing like the originals as I feel these are more scary for kids. Have put it away for a few more years until they get older.
5,funny cartoon,i ordered this DVD for my grandbaby.. for xmas.. he loves it.. can't put it down.. orginial case and cover excellent cover..thanks
5,GREAT VIDEO!! my kids are 4&6 and love it!!,"they watch this movie over and over-- great funnn!! not huge scooby fans, just got it because it sounded interesting.... and it is now one of their favorites~and they always want to watch it!! great price too!!!"
5,Nice quality at a reasonable cost,"I bought many of the OXO Good Grips kitchen gadgets for my wife to replace an assortment of older items that had just lost their looks, and so forth.This stainless slotted spoon as with all of the OXO Good Grips items we bought feels great in your hand, is well made and looks great.I would recommend the OXO Good Grips items to any of my family and friends, as a very nice home kitchen utensils set."
5,Good Product -- good price,"What can be said about this ... it's a spoon! But it's made of good quality SS, doesn't rust when I send it thru the dishwasher and it's big! OXO makes some great products and Amazon sells them at great prices ... win/win situation for sure."
5,Best from Scandinavia in many years...,"Second You Sleep for me stands out as one of the most important in my CD collection. This may be personal, but as a matter of fact I played it every day for a year and never got tired of it! Sren Huss is probably the best singer today, and I feal sorry for all the people who have not yet discovered this brilliant group from Denmark. Thank you Saybia for making this music! :)"
2,Didn't care for this one,"I've liked all other Gwynne Forster books I've read, but this one...I did not like. I felt Veronica and Schyler were to stiff and formal, the story plot had alot of potential but fell very short of my expectations, and I could not understand how Veronica could not openly blame her mother and stepfather for what they'd done. I'll continue to keep reading and rereading Ms. Forster's books, but will not reread this one."
4,Sweet love story,"The beginning was kind of slow, but I really enjoyed the book. This is my first novel by Gwynne Forster and I liked her style of writing. Veronica character was portrayed as a STRONG successful black woman and I really appreciate how Veronica held her own. This was a sweet love story. I will definitely read another one of Ms. Forster's books."
1,A miss,Gwynne Forster is a hit or miss author. This book was definitely a miss. I couldn't believe it took the whole book before she asked for the truth. It had ok moments but overall boring.
2,Fell flat,"This is a re-read for me, originally read 11/2010.It was really painful to read. Although the attraction was written on the pages between Schyler and Veronica I just couldn't feel the chemistry when reading it. I also think the characters were written way beyond their years. Veronica was only 32, and Schyler 36 and he said things like:""I'm a man who believes in making people live up to their notices, and I've got a fistful of yours. You with me?""and""I go for a woman who has a hearty appetite and doesn't pick over the food. It doubles my pleasure in her company""I know this book was originally published in 2000, but I don't think women would go for these lines then or now. Veronica had some awful punchlines as well. The 2nd time around I tried really hard, but just couldn't force myself to finish this one. Too bad though, because the story had a lot of potential to be a really good love story."
4,Maine Mystery,"I enjoyed this book. It is the first one in this series that I have read. I plan to read the 2 previous books now as well.I enjoyed the characters. Jacobia is a smart amateur sleuth. She and Ellie are a great team for investigating. She is a newcomer to the area but was knowledgeable about the area and with Ellie's help got the locals to talk to her.Her exhusband is an unlikeable fellow and I was glad he wasn't too involved in the story.I would like to see a little more interaction with her son Sam and her boyfriend Wade.I felt this story was very good. I did have an inkling as to who did it before it ended, but I wasn't sure.I recommend this book."
3,Okay,"While I didn't find this book to be as interesting as Triple Witch, I just wanted to comment on the much-improved writing by the author. I'd complained before about the distracting overuse of commas in Graves' other two books; I'm pleased to see that this book flowed nicely.Despite my not enjoying Wicked Fix as much as Triple Witch, I would read Graves again. She gives her characters a good amount of depth and her dialogue and narrative is very witty."
4,wicked fix,this is the first book i've read by this author. book came in excellentcondition.sallyanngolf
5,"Best ""rock bio"" I've read","This is the best ""rock bio"" I've read (and I've read quite a few). Michael takes an approach I haven't seen taken in a book of this type before . . . so personal and honest. In Pegasus he deals with much more than simply the literal history of the late-sixties underground rock group, LOVE. He uses the story of the band to give the readers a rare glimpse beneath the surface of an entire era, writing with an ""editorial"" slant and a style that borders on the ""conversational."" Great cast of real-life characters. Couldn't put it down."
3,"Good, but limited","I rate this book ""five stars"" as far as it goes. It is an excellent introductory treatment of names, naming practices, titles, gods,and geographic names in Ancient Egyptian, complete with copies of actual inscriptions from obelisks and other monuments. It is fascinating to read, but very difficult to use due to a lack of indexing of the Ancient Egyptian terms. The book is small enough to take to a museum with you, but you would waste a lot of time thumbing through the pages trying to find the particular list you want."
2,The Giant Gila Monster,Pretty cool 50's fright movie. Normal romance and plain good old fun. I have it in my collection. NOT BAD!! Count Wolfenstein
1,Utterly pointless device,"So you need to copy data onto Hi-MD minidiscs? But why?! You have to plug your minidisc player into this thing and copy the data off the memory card onto your minidisc player, but you're not done yet. You need to then copy the data off your minidisc player onto your PC using Sony's software. The major advantage is that a Hi-MD minidisc holds about 1 gigabyte, but that advantage is only economic: a 1-gigabyte hi-MD minidisc is about six dollars, which isn't bad right now, but since this device is over a hundred bucks, just get yourself another memory card and leave this thing alone.Speaking of costs, this device consumes AAA batteries--it doesn't even get power via USB. Steer clear unless you're a die-hard minidisc fan looking for reasons to keep using minidisc."
4,Monster flat screen mount,"I am very happy with the flatscreen mount, my only complaint is I had to purchase longer bolts to use the spacers with my 50 inch panasonic tv. Becasue the TV had a bump out at the bottom and a 2 inch clearance at the top, I was forced to use both spacers with longer bolts than were suppplied. With the TV plug location, I also had to relocate an outlet above the bracket as opposed to directly below it. Overall I am very satisfied with the product so far and feel it provides a very secure mount for my television."
1,"Excellent Writer,","Not an excellent economist. Galbraith's style and ease of readability is almost second to none but there is little substance in this book. I would recommend Mises, Rothbard, or Hayek to any interested in economics. I will say this however, you can't know what you disagree with, nor why you do, if you don't read their work.With that said though the rating I gave was low I do think it is a necessary purchase and read so that one can make themselves familiar with many of the flawed arguments they will come into contact with.A biased or selective reader is a limited in knowledge."
3,Review of a book delivery,The order was placed at the same time as another book which arrived 2 weeks quicker despite being shipped at the same time. More effort might have been made to keep me informed. Other than that the book arrived it was in good condition and was what I wanted.
1,Follow at your peril,"This is an entertaining read and almost certainly the most comprehensive work on the subject. But the fundamental premise (basically: the casinos will do anything to screw you out of your money, so here's how to sink to their level) is not only self-demeaning (who could consider days spent trying to weasel their way into a crummy buffet a vacation anyway?), but almost certain to fail even on its own terms. As some other reviewers here have correctly pointed out, one bad streak at the tables will completely wipe out whatever paltry ""gains"" the comp-grubber may have nickel-and-dimed their way into. Consequently, this book could be likened to an auto repair manual that destroys your car engine if you follow its instructions. Buyer beware."
4,Want to understand how casino give away free stuff?,"This book will help you decipher how you can get free stuff from casinos. I preferred Jean Scott's ""The Frugal Gambler"" however this is a worth while purchase and it gives another persons ideas."
3,"Amusing, but...","Rubin is an amusing fellow, obviously a debaucher, degenerate, and reprobate. This I admire, along with his writing style and ability to spin an ancedote. What I can't grasp is the cheapskate mentality that would have folks do almost anything for a comp. I go to Vegas to gamble and to win money. I can readily afford the cheap airfares, rooms, and food or I wouldn't go. I can't imagine making large bets into a negative deck just because the floorman is watching and I want to fool him into inflating my rating. Intentionally spill a drink on the table to stop the game for a few minutes so you play fewer hands than reported? Gimme a break. Ninety percent of average players would be far better off learning to gamble intelligently than worrying about sqeezing a few extra comp dollars. Still, some of the stories are laugh out loud funny and worth the price of the book."
3,Funny horse,It is pocket toy good when my 10 years old daughter wants to some relax from her daily activities and wants to feel like a small child.
2,Translator Review,The screen is too dark to easily see the translation. I would not recommend this unit. Everything else works fine.
2,Another overhyped title by Xbox.,"Driver 3 is plagued by horrible controls, interactivity and sub par graphics. First of all you accelerate with trigger, which hurts your finger after awhile, the sensitivity is LOW, controls are inverted. Your characters movements also seem unreal. Graphics could've been alot better. Gameplay is average. I know its a large game but what I've seen with other titles Driv3r's just plain sucks. Alot of ideas were adopted from GTA also. GTA 3 is so much better than this. It seems like Atari rushed this title towards the end."
1,Driver 3 sucks,"I rented this game from blockbuster only becuase it was out of stock and was guaranteed in stock. It was not even worth the gas to get to the store. All the ""online compatable"" feature is is just sharing replays of levels. The levels are hard and frustrating. I enjoy a hard game, but this was just stupid. Every try is ""he got away"" or ""you Lost him"" If you want a good game, get the GTA double pack for the same price."
2,Annoying,"This game would have been ok if it didn't FREEZE EVERY 10 SECONDS! The graphics were good but that's about it. I rented this game from Blockbuster and I looked at the disc.. seemed fine. But sometimes it wouldn't even start up on the Xbox, and when it finally did, it would freeze about every 10 seconds. If you like being annoyed, buy this game!"
2,beautiful game with extremely difficult gameplay,"this game has excellent graphics and physics, but that doesn't make it any more fun to play the first 30 seconds of a level 30 times because if you miss one turn or clip a tree and have to start over. Even missions that should be easy like following a police car to a crime scene are easily blown by one mistake. I've only played this game to level three and I'm already setting it aside."
2,Looks great but Falls short,"First off I have to say this game looks great, driver 3 set's the bar for how GTA 4 should look. The detail of the cars is top notch as well as the city's , but it all ends there. I enjoy playing a game that will allow me to actually play and interact in the experience of the game , Driver 3 does not do that by far. I don't want to say its a HARD game , its just poorly designed. When you play missions over and over and over constantly failing to even get close to the car your trying desperately to chase because your burn out or hit a pole that completely stops you and with in seconds the title says "" You lost him"" or "" He got away"" , the frustration is unbearably constant , I just want to play to get close not to get shut down within seconds. I can't believe the game testers allowed this flaw to get pass . Within and hour of me playing the game for the first time I shut it off and installed GTA vice city , thank you ol RockStar Thank You...."
4,Driver 3 is fun,"I must be one of the only people that finds GTA not that fun. When I played 3 and Vice City, I got bored of the game in like 5 minutes. My main complaint is the driving physics. I thought Driver 3 is a better game because the driving physics are great. People may get frustrated becuase they have to master how to do power slides and and use the ebrake but I believe it makes the game more fun. If you don't then you will never catch people. The driving A.I. is great I think. When someone is fleeing from you they are not just going to drive straight and slowly make right and left turns. They make sharp turns and weave in and out of trafic. It's just like controling the case car in a movie. I do however agree with the others that trying to shoot people was hard, but I got used to it pretty fast. Overall I would recogmend this game."
2,Driving is cool,The Driving in this game is cool and semi-realistic. The damage to the cars looks amazing. But other than that it all blows. The missions are so unbelievably hard it's not even fun. If you don't have auto-aim on then you aren't going to get anywhere because the shooting is extremely unrealistic and also hard. The cop cars are ten times as fast as yours so have fun running from them. There is no good rocket launcher except some dinky thing that shoots out little grenades and they only go like 30 feet. Overall I and it looks like many other people say save your money or get GTA.
4,Drive to live,The game is very good. The game is not as bad as other people say. The on foot is okay not bad the driving is the strong point of the game. The fmv's are realy good feels like your in a movie. so if you want to buy it buy it it's worth your money.
1,not even close,ok it is alot like gta exept for the fact that it has no features ecxept for free roam. missions are very linear. you can drive a car and that is about all the fun your ever gonna have. i can see that kids want gta. this is not even close to as much fun as some other no blod gta clones. here are a couple i think did a good job. true crime new york is the closest. mercinaries is the best graphics and gamesplay. it gives more features than even gta. one of the less popular clones is mafia. that game is just hands down the best one. u want a non vilent gta go buy mafia. the last one is probably the most different. it has everything gta has besides xxx even the mass amounts of blood. they gave it a great twist. we have all thought to ourselves at one time hey how about a tony hawk were you can kill and steal cars and stuff. the game that did the un thinkable is none other than total overdose. so my point is that driver sucks so just dont even bother renting it.
2,Sucky Game,all this game is a rip off of Grand Theft Auto: Vice City and not a very good one at that...rent this...do not buy it!
1,Driv3r,This is one of the worst ever made games....Long cut scenes....A story that jumps around too much...And when they say you can go anywhere and do anything they lie....It is very hard and confusing....
4,a great game,this game has got to be good after seeing previews it looksgreat im going to buy itit comes out the same day of me brithday
5,Great game,It arrived as described and i haven't had any issues with it. I would recommend this item to anyone without hesitation.
1,A broken game,"Just bad, plain bad the only thing saving this game is its theater or replay mode. And using cheats in this game is fun too. But the single player is the worst I've seen in a video game. Its like the developers spent more money on the cutscenes then the actual game. Because the controls handle poorly the missions are structured poorly everything in this game feels shallow and has that ""been there done that feel"". Just avoid this game and please save your money don't support badly designed games like this."
3,Hysterical!!!,"2 of the funniest & yet tantalizing sci-fi movies ever. Have a ball laughing, even with the lights off -Dale/Rock Hill, SC"
1,"Seller was rude, book was awful","I was referred by a friend to buy this book. When I got it, it wasn't what I expected. It's high level religious studies type of literature which is fine if that's what you expected. I asked for a refund or exchange, but the seller wanted me to refuse the shipment or send it back in the original packaging. Since it was a couple of days later that was impossible. She inferred I was lying to her, and said that if I returned it and it wasn't in perfect condition as it was sent to me in, that she wouldn't give me full credit. I could see where that was going, so I didn't return it. I wouldn't buy from this seller again. Very rude!"
2,Outdated book,"This is outdated scholarship that continues to be reprinted because it is trendy and publishers can make money. Raphael Patai is not a ""noted scholar"", but a learned rabbi whose understanding of the topic is based on comparative religion models from the turn of the last century. He is an amateur who has done some research and woven a popular account on a trendy topic. For a noted scholar's popular account, people should read Dever's Did God Have a Wife? A much better book by a much more qualified author. Or, get Carol Meyers book, Households and Holiness: Religious Culture of Israelite Women."
3,Try to imagine a version of Are You Experienced? without Purple Haze,"Because that's exactly what the UK version of Jimi's classic debut Are You Experienced? is. That's right - no Purple Haze. Think about that for a second or two. Then keep thinking - this version does not contain other key cuts from that album such as The Wind Cries Mary or Hey Joe. That's right. Three Hendrix classics, at least on the US version, skipped. Not only that, but this disc replaces those three classics with fillers Remember and Can You See Me. However, it does get points for containing Red House, one of Hendrix's best songs. Interestingly enough, the US version doesn't. (Who's bright idea was THAT?) Unless you're a purist, skip this, skip the US version, and pick up the combo package, which gives you the original US release plus key cuts Red House, Stone Free and Highway Chile"
5,One of the top ten rock albums ever,"Jimi Hendrix is a bonafide rock genius. During a time of great creativity in popular music he stands out as the originator of rock guitar. There are two kinds of rock guitar playing: before Hendrix and after. He influenced Miles Davis, Sting, Gil Evans, and Leonard Bernstein. No other guitar player has had such an impact on the history of music."
2,Slow postage,I'm sorry but I still haven't received the CD ! Taking a long time at 4 weeks ! Cheers Steve.
2,Did not care for it.,I ended up sending this item back. It was much to big for my use. In fact it was big enough that it would not fit in any of my kitchen drawers.
5,OXO ladle,"I bought this for my daughter and she was thrilled with it. I got a good price, fast delivery, and the product was in excellent shape (as described)."
5,Haydn and Redpath hit it off,Jean Redpath as usual sings superbly on these Scottish songs arranged by Haydn.The surprise however is Haydns treatment of the songs. One might have expected them to have had the full classical makeover but that would be to underestimate Haydn. The songs retain their rawness and austerity and there is just the barest airstroke of the masters brush to be detected
5,just a great album.,"Song of the songs are dark, some of the songs are more upbeat, all of them are great. Elton John did a great job on this album, I consider it to be one of his best, I especially love the title track. If you've never heard it, order it now. If you allready own the record, order it anyway, it sounds a lot better on CD."
3,Far from Elton's best,"This album has inexplicably been elevated to almost God-like status in the past few years which is curious because this is far from Elton's best work. He was still two years away from reaching his pinnacle with ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"" and the stark fact is that there are only two outstanding songs on this disc. The first is the incomparable opening track, ""Tiny Dancer"" which is one of EJ's greatest and most melodic songs. This was proof of the riches that were to come in the 1972-1975 period. The other fine track is ""Levon,"" with some of Bernie's best lyrics.If you are beginning to sample Elton's early work, this is not your best pick. Chose instead ""Don't Shoot me, I'm only the Piano Player"" or his greatest album, ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road."" Unfortunately this disc has worn well but never contained much interesting material to begin with."
1,Music of a real Madman,Only a real Madman could make an album as horrid as this one. No wonder Sir Elton died in 1968 - he must have drowned himself with this album!!!
1,One of the most appalling loads of dreck ever made,"With all respect to John's proficiency as a pianist, this album (and any other with his name anywhere near it) is, and will more than likely always be, absolutely inexcusable. It's like a sham that nobody's seen fit to reveal as such. Horrid. ""Levon"" is the single biggest offender, by the by."
5,Some of the Best Songs of Elton John,"The CD ""Madman Across The Water"" features, in my opinion, some of the best songs of Elton John. I thought that almost all of the songs on this CD were enjoyable to listen to, though only two became relatively well known. The songs on ""Madman Across the Water"" illustrate the excellent voice of Elton John and the writing skills of Bernie Taupin. My ratings:Tiny Dancer: 9/10Levon: 10/10Razor Face: 5/10Madman Across the Water: 9/10Indian Sunset: 9/10Holiday Inn: 8/10Rotten Peaches; 7/10All The Nasties: 7/10Goodbye: 8/10This CD is a good buy for anyone that likes Elton John's music"
5,Pure ballads,"In my opinion, Elton John peaked right here. Nothing would ever top this album in terms of musical genius, lyrical genius (thanks to Bernie) and excellent production. The front half of this album is absolutely amazing. Within the first five songs are four of my favorite Elton songs: ""Tiny Dancer"" ""Levon"" ""Madman Across the Water"" and my all-time personal favorite ""Indian Sunset.""While other Elton John albums have had bonus tracks added when remastered, I'm eternally grateful of Rocket Records for leaving this album as it was originally released. ""Goodbye"" [albeit sappy] is the perfect way to end this album. Excellent music."
3,The Tone Can Just Drone,"This is NOT one of Elton John's more varied recordings. Most of the songs are sad sounding ballads. In addition, the instrumental backing consists of piano and a string orchestra. Where is the supporting band? Razor Face and Rotten peaches add the only oomphs to an otherwise dreary collection. And the second half of this recording as three tracks which are pure throwaways. Tiny Dancer and Levon are two beautiful tracks so with that in mind the status of this record is clearly elevated."
4,Handing Tickets Out For God,"The above (from ""Tiny Dancer"") is one of the greatest lines of any song.This is the last of Elton John the serious musician. Soon to follow would be ""Rocket Man,"" ""Honky Cat,"" ""Daniel,"" etc. Good songs all, but these songs, led by the incomparable ""Tiny Dancer,"" are just, well, special.""Levon"" ""Madman"" and ""Holiday Inn"" are more great songs. If you got into Elton John later in his career, go back and discover this one."
3,Get the original if you can,"It really is a shame when a classic is ""remastered"" to make it ""better"".Why do they think it was a ""classic"" to begin with.The remastering greatly muddied the waters (pun intended) . It is especially noticeable on Holiday Inn. A lot of detail is missing or pushed to the background.I only gave it three stars because of the original."
4,review,"product was fine. HOWEVER I will not buy from this vendor again as bought 2 cds, both were sent in the same envelope but I was charged with 2 handling /Shipping chrgs. I questioned this practice and was advsed by vendor I was charged this basically because he could."
3,Hollies,God hollies harmonies but Rickfor doesn't fit with his voice on this one..Only Makes the Alan Clarke tunes stand out on the other albums.
5,Magnificent!,"A set of excellent songs capturing the true Hollies' style, in spite of Alan Clarke's departure. Though being a huge Hollies fan, I must confess I haven't heard this record before (it would be tedious to say why), except for three of four well-known hits. The fact is that after I listened to it I realized the album is just a gem. I felt overwhelmed by the whole result, I must say. So, do not hesitate, go and buy it!"
2,"Works ok, sturdy, difficult to clean.","This masher looks great, is (so far) sturdy, but is difficult to clean."
1,Mash & Crash,"My wife is a huge mash potato fan, so I thought I would purchase this product for her. Day 1, while she was mashing with family in town, it snapped at the base. Later, after complaining to my fellow 'Oxo' users, they all said the same thing...""it happened to me to"" & ""get the metal base"". I guess we got about a dollar a minute out of it (basically $5 of a product). So...in conclusion, pay the extra few bucks and get a more durable product."
1,Don't waste your money,The only redeeming thing about this product is its comfortable handle. We bought nylon since our last metal masher had to be tossed due to rusting. We spend more time getting the potato out of the narrow masher segments than we spend mashing. It is very frustrating. Stick with the wider segments. We have since replaced it with another metal one with wider spaces - an Oxo one with a comfortable handle. I will give 5 stars to Oxo's customer service. I contacted them about my disappointment and they are giving me a replacement product of equal value.
5,best potatoe masher + I have had,"I really like this potatoe masher this one was a replacement for one I had like it for years that finally gave out. I use it for more than mashing potatoes. Squash- meat that you are cooking frozen, mixing tuna salad - egg salad. Great Product"
3,a horror fan,"These movies are quite dated and I did not like them as much as I thought I would. A bucket of blood is much overated Roger Corman film I dont see myself watching again buy myself. maybe with friends it would be good for a laugh.The Giant Gila Monster was too slow not for modern Horror fans for sure.I gave these films 3 stars becauce this double feature is a bargone, if you like this films apparantly many pepole do. The transfer was not bad Hey a cartoon and all."
1,"The shoes are falling apart, I've had them 10 days","I liked these shoes initially but I am so disappointed now. The shoes are falling apart! I am even wondering if they are conterfeit or something because it is hard to believe a company would sell a shoe this poorly constructed.I started to feel a weird thing in one foot, then a day later the other foot too.. then the next day I found out what it was - the inside of the shoe coming apart. I have not been hard on these shoes, just walked in them.I've had them 10 days and they are now useless, not repairable."
1,Movie Alert,"I wanted to write a review to alert viewers as to how bad this version of ""Coma"" is! But, others have written excellent warnings. My response to this film was to buy the original 1970's version of Coma. There is not even a hint, in this miniseries, of a plausible reason why the Jefferson Institute would exist. In the original version, the most chilling part was the realization that the Institute could exist in some form!"
2,BATTERY NOT INCLUDED,"If you have seen the original ""Coma"" and were not in a coma during the first 10 minutes of the film, you should have it fairly well figured out except for some slight nuances.Susan Wheeler (Lauren Ambrose) is a third year hot shot medical student and now an intern. Her grandfather was the legendary Dr. Wheeler who is remembered by the older staff. She quickly discovers something wrong is going on the hospital, the only question that remains is who can she trust. This should have been a a movie that examines the moral and ethical questions of ""death panels"", the common good, and embryonic stem cell research. Instead it only glosses over the topic and then inanely makes a mockery of the whole thing.It is really ashamed because they had good actors to support this script and failed to deliver the goods. They managed to turn scenes which should have been shocking into the mundane.Made for TV, TV-14"
1,"Absolute, total waste of time and talent. Sad.","To call this movie bad would be the understatement of the century. The lead actress is very good, but the big name supporting cast is wasted. The original wasn't great, but it's far more watchable than this. I can't imagine ever wanting to watch this again, let alone paying for it in the first place."
1,Stick with the original...,"What a waste of time watching this four hour A&E; production; and now they actually will try to get someone to buy a copy of this?Though I haven't seen the original in a long, long time, I do remember some actual drama in that movie; while this series had none and constantly asked the viewer to suspend disbelief. What's with the nutcase guy? The whole thing was just a mess, mostly incoherent. And People magazine gave this like 3 1/2 stars? And the Washington Post even rated it favorably. Is it me, or has our threshold for entertainment gotten really low? Do yourself a favor and watch the original."
1,just plain bad,"just finished watching this 4 hour assault on an otherwise good book. everyone is entitled to a bad day at the office and this should rank for the scott brothers as their worst ever. if you like the book and like movies made from books then watch the original. this is 4 hours that you will never get back. did i mention i didn't like this effort. bad, just plain bad."
4,"ok for me, probably really great to others","i bought the reader for a class. really didnt end up being my cup of tea, but can see how it could be for others. if your into feminism and scifi this is the book for you. good essays well written by a variety of solid writers."
5,Great!,"I am very happy with my purchase. I owned this item on VHS a few years ago and lost it during a move. I find his instructions clear and I was able to follow them soon after without having to verify I was doing them correctly. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to give it a try. Once you do, you will understand why it is so popular."
2,Tai chi,I found it very hard to follow as he does not turn away from you. I will try it again but now I would not recommend it to others
3,Slow intro,"This has such a slow intro that you are sitting there thinking ""shoot me...This has to start soon"" It is a peaceful workout but after awhile you want to get to the good stuff."
3,Okay if you are familiar with basic moves,"I bought this video hoping to learn T'ai-Chi. I was disappointed in that it was not easy to follow and did not fully explain each movement. Don't misunderstand, I like David-Dorian Ross and I love his Budokon Beginning Practice DVD. This is good workout if you are familiar with basic T'ai Chi movements, but for step by step instruction I would recommend DVD's by Tiffany Chen or Terence Dunn."
3,Mistakes are confusing,"I agree with the reviews above. On the whole the video is fun but several mistakes keep it from from being the excellent product it could of been. The right/left issue was not easy for me to overcome and then there are several actual for mistakes. The biggest one is on Crane spreads wings. I had to go and reference several other sources to confirm which time the instructor did it right (The initial form is correct, the form used later is not.) If the instructor is versed in Tai-Chi how could he of not known he was doing it wrong? Nervous on camera? did he review the dvd and not catch that? or did they just say ""oh well they will figure it out.""A properly edited/corrected version could go a long way in making this an item to truely recommend."
3,I thought I knew left from right?????,"Yep, I thought I was going nuts and had no cordination until I realized that sometimes David is saying ""left"" while moving the ""right"" arm....uggg. Other than that I do like the format of the instruction minus a mistake or two. I would give this DVD 5 stars if David knew left from right."
3,T'ai Chi Beginning Practice,"I enjoy the style, tone, and pace of this video. I do wish, however, that it were a ""mirror"" presentation in which the instructor moved his, for example, right arm when he was saying ""left."" I get myself all tangled up."
4,Well done,"This DVD is well done and David Dorian Ross certainly appears to be an expert in T'ai Chi. The scenery is beautiful and it's a very easy-to-follow program. T'ai Chi is illusively difficult to do and very mentally challenging. It's not your standard workout DVD. But it's well done and high quality, so if you're looking to learn T'ai Chi, this would be a great choice."
4,A Good Intro,I bought the T'ai Chi Beginning Practice and then bought the Daily Practice by the same guy. I enjoyed both. The instruction is pretty clear. I would recommend buying the Daily Pratice after having gone through the Beginning Practice. The daily builds on what was learned in the beginning practice.
5,Great teacher - easy to understand,I didnt purchase this dvd here -but came specifically to find more by David Dorian Ross. He speaks well and sets the calm pace without being irritating.It boggles my mind that people become frustrated and do not just replay the dvd or stop and practice the move until its theirs. I have 12 yrs of martial arts training but I learn new moves slowly repeating over and over then move on to the next one. How much fun would a dvd be if the move was done 100 times before the next move was taught.I have looked for a tai chi school and not finding one have tried lots of tapes/dvds. Now that I have found DDR - I will stick with his as long as possible.
2,So I DO know my Left from my Right,"Thank you other reviewers. I thought I was going crazy there. I know there is a mirror image when watching yoga and other work out DVDS...but this really bothered me. Perhaps it is because it is a BEGINNERS DVD! I don't want to hear left and then see you go right on the screen...especially not when I'm trying to coordinate feet, legs, arms, and hands all at once! And, then I come to read that he actually does make mistakes...very, very, very confusing. I got frustrated and gave up on the beginners section.I do like the scenery better on the a.m. workout--Maui beach...but I think I might just watch it once, and then turn the sound off, maybe even put on my own music, and do it. After all, I don't need to be frustrated while doing my relaxing Tai Chi!"
2,confused 2,I totally agree with red hatter ..The intructor says one thing while he's doing another its confusingadn im not even sure which way is the right way now...
3,Confused?,I agree with the previous reviews but I would like to add that the instructor is doing one thing and giving the wrong instructions. For Brush knee and push he tells you that the left hand comes in when actually he has been doing the right side. I also was having a real problem doing Crane spreads wings until last night I noticed ANOTHER MISTAKE. The first time he did the move the weight was on one foot and the opposite foot tapped and the corresponding hand came up. The next time the opposite hand came up. No wonder I am confused. I will keep going but it is frustrating.
2,Mistakes in saying 'left' and 'right' make this confusing,"Several times on my initial run through I had to rewind, rewatch, rewind, rewatch, rewind, rewatch certain parts because I thought I was just not getting it right. Then I realized that sometimes the instructor was saying left, but moving right. He was not mirroring the entire time, however, he was just making mistakes. It was terribly confusing.This gets 2 stars (instead of one) because I like everything else about this video - the way he speaks is soothing, the music is soft, the background is pleasing. It's just a shame the instructor is not clearer."
2,Tai Chi,"This is an OK beginning practice of Tai Chi. There are two sequences you can watch. The first if a complete beginning sequence/routine. The second is more of a follow-along.One thing that decreases the quality of this beginning practice is that in the first sequence he does not use mirrored left and right direction. So if he says do something to the left, he does it too the left and you need to do it to the left as well. However, this becomes a little difficult when focusing on learning new movements.Furthermore, in the second sequence he does use mirrored direction. This makes the second sequence quite a bit easier to follow along."
2,Not good for beginners,"There are way too many cuts and edits in this video to see the whole routine through. Even playing it at half speed I'm having trouble seeing the full body positions.There needs to be static shots of the person teaching you. This one constantly cross fades and only has half body shots. Can't see his feet, can't see his other hand. Not helpful at all."
1,Need a mirror image to follow instructor.,I really like David Dorian-Ross but when you are teaching beginners they need to be able to follow the movements. That is why aerobics instructors lead the class behind them.If you are a beginner it is too hard to follow the movements facing the instructor. I have to follow the DVD in a mirror or I get lost.
2,Difficult to follow,"I tried this DVD for the first time this week. I must echo the sentiment of other reviewers in regards to the ""mirror"" issue. I find it very hard to follow his movements when they are the opposite of what he is describing. Had I read reviews, I would have purchased a different beginning Tai Chi DVD and wish I had. It is high quality video production."
5,"No Frills, No Filler","It's a shame bands like the Brandos fall into obsurity when sh*tlike 98 degrees get's all the hype and popularity; these guys were ahead of their time (any band that can cover a CCR tune and make it their own deserves airplay and critical accolades!);at 14.98 this cd is a bargain, you won't be disappointed..."
5,This American band should be heard in America!!,"I first had the chance to encounter The Brandos live, opening for INXS on their ""Kick"" tour in the late '80s. To put it mildly, I was blown away!!This is a band that never had the proper chance: bad management, record label problems and the like have kept them relegated to playing European dates (when they can afford to) for the past decade.Do yourself a favor, this CD is not very expensive for an import. Listen to ""Gettysburg"" (the first track) one time. If you can resist listening to the rest of the album, you have ice water in your veins!Other highlights are ""Matter of Survival"" and ""Nothing to Fear."" Come to think of it, I can't think of a bad song on the entire CD.Do yourself and everyone you know a favor, buy this CD, and bring the Brandos home!"
3,Dissapointed,"Yes, the sound quality is great. But the most of the songs just don't transfer very well to Goldfinger. The liner notes say they had the horn players from The Skeltones, BIG MISTAKE, that is the worst ska band in the history of music. In short, a subpar appetiser until the new full CD."
4,NEEDS MORE SONGS,"Goldfinger is great, but they are not what I would call, a good cover band.This Cd is great anyway.I loved the version of ""feel like makin love"" that they do.If you are a true Goldfinger fan, buy it, if not, try their self titled Cd first."
2,Not quite right,"Other than 3 things this would be a great watch. First the second hand on the stop watch does not index on the second marks. Second there is a pin on the clasp that has come out 3 times in 4 months. And last this is not the band it came with. For some reason it came with a plain stainless band instead of the black PVD inserts. It does keep good time and the illumination can't be beat so, I guess you pays your money and takes your chances."
3,Childhood friends who have many fun adventures while growing up.,"Interesting tale with many fanciful stories. Very descriptive writing, makes a reader feel that they could see the scenery and hear the sounds ."
5,My absolute favorite of all Montgomery's books,"The Golden Road, which is a sequel to The Story Girl, is beautifully written. It will make you laugh, and even shed a tear or too. It will bring back memories of childhood, or of the childhood we wished we'd had. Of all of Montgomery's novels, this is the one I return to most often. A true little gem, for all ages. The sotry of great aunt Eliza's visit is one of the funniest chapters I have ever read. Delightful!"
4,Read immediately after finishing The Story Girl!,"I enjoyed The Golden Road, but not as much as I enjoyed The Story Girl. I recommend you read the two novels together, one right after the other. If you enjoy reading books set in a long-ago era, the books have a charm to them. If you like action, these books will not appeal to you as much.In my opinion, it is not possible to enjoy The Golden Road unless you have just recently read The Story Girl. Not all of the characters and actions in TGR will be understoon unless you have read TSG. The characters are a lot of fun and are well-written. The adventures this group of friends have together will stay in your memory forever."
5,"Continuation of the Story Girl books, Excellent stories","This book carries the family through tweens and teens and young adulthood. There is a spread of ages in the family, so there are still enough kid's antics while the book starts to tell the issues older kids face moving into more adult roles, and looking outside themselves and how the fit in the larger community outside family and school. My sons enjoyed this book as well as the Story Girl, and if you enjoyed the first one, you should follow the continuation of the story."
5,Worked well,Held up well to my 25lb turkey at Thanksgiving. Was sturdy and the handle didn't fall of like my last one
4,Well made but dangerous for the careless,"I noted another reviewer commented the fork was quite sharp on the ends; boy was he right. The two ends are almost like the end of a knife, very sharp and dangerous if you are not careful. The plus side is they go into meat easily with little pressure. The main reason I purchased this item was for the rubberized handle which is hand friendly. It looks and feels like it will last a long time (the handle); the main steel is stainless and fairly heavy duty (it won't bend easily if at all); all in all, this is a quality item. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the chance you could be stabbed by the tool if you were careless; it's kind of like a knife, be careful with it and it will serve you well, be careless, and you may have two puncture marks on your body, and they won't be vampire bites."
3,As advertised but awfully dangerous,"This fork is just what they say. However, it is dangerous because of thesharp prongs which have an inner very sharp area. You can't jsut put itin a drawer or store it without a solid covering over the prongs or you'llget seriously stabbed or cut."
3,Deception with a bounce,"The product itself is fine. My dogs never tire of chasing it, bouncing it, rolling it. But you won't get a Pack of 2 - just 1 ball. And the freight is outragious - twice the price of the ball - and twice the price of a bigger ball from another Amazon company. Though promised the Pack of 2 will be removed, here it is at review time still misleading customers. I am sure I am not the only one to believe the PACKAGE would contain 2 (TWO). How long does it take to correct a data base in the nano second world?"
2,"""Copping a free ride on Mahler's music""","Please be careful before buying this one.I give it two stars only for the sake of the first half of the dvd: Attrazione d'amore. It is about 50 minutes of documentary on the interaction between the Concertgebouw Orchestra and Conductor Riccardo Chailly. It has some very good moments, but appears desultory, never settling down to state clearly its point.The second half, Luciano Berio's Voyage to Cythera, is like an old-fashioned analog radio, not tuned to the proper station. You hear snatches of Mahler's music, simultaneously accompanied by static, talking, and various loud noises that distract you from the Mahler.It really sounds to me like a pseudointellectual attempt to ""cop a free ride"" on Mahler's music, when one has no significant music to write on his own.If the title leads you (as it did me) to believe this dvd will expand your Mahler collection, then please borrow it from the library to try it before you buy it."
1,Audio missing. Please fix.,Audio missing. Please fix. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. Mary had a little lamb.Jack be nimble jack be quick.
1,Unavailable!?!,"Listing this episode as ""unavailable"" is not the same as actually bothering to fix it. How hard can it possibly be to reload this on your server? Likely no more effort than changing the status from ""buy now"" to ""unavailable"". It would be good if you (Amazon) would stop pushing/delivering new episodes (and billing for them) until the previous ones are fixed - I like to watch episodic series in order, they tend to make a little more sense that way. Fix this please!"
1,see the pretty silent film.,First it took a week to be put up and now no sound for a week. This is such a fail.
1,"No audio, just clicking",I have left feedback and put in a request from tech support. Now I'm trying a review. Please fix this. It really weakens my faith in the whole don't-buy-dvds-just-buy-streaming-videos concept.
1,Disappeared from ROKU,These episodes...all of Season 4 have disappeared from my streaming device. How can I get them back? This is how I watch them!Thanks!
4,"good , series, but previous seasons were better","spoilers alert!!!************Wow, how many people can they replace in one season!!! It was an enjoyable season."
3,Not a good as previous seasons,"But, it was a transition season so looking forward to next season. I have nothing more to write, but they are requiring me to make it 8 words longer."
2,not impressed.,"was very disappointed to have lost George, Nina and Mitchell. this 4th season just is not up to par in it's writing. the intensity of the first three seasons is just not there."
4,More interesting than the feeble attempt by the SyFy channel to translate to the USA,"I am a huge fan of the British version of this show. I don't want to spoil it for others so no plot details. American viewers of the entire series need to realize that the cultural references are often quite opaque to us. The colloquial languages of Britain sometimes should be subtitled when exported. The Scots do it. However, I myself enjoy listening to the various dialects and find the challenge worth it. The entire series is wildly absurd, comically serious and somewhat philosophical. Those are just the qualities which the American version does not capture."
2,Disappointing,"I was hooked on ""Being Human"" (BBS Version) with the first episode of Season one. Seasons 2-3 continued to hold my attention. However, Season 4 with the killing off of two of the three main characters and replacing them with much weaker versions was disappointing. The writers instead of trying to create the depth of the two former main characters, instead went for one episode story lines, gory scenes and a few attempts at humor. PLEASE BRING BACK MITCHELL."
3,New characters and over the top,"This fourth installment of the Being Human series has almost an entirely new cast that is less compelling than the original cast from season one. Although the story is magical, this season takes the story to a grander scale and follows an end of the world narrative. I liked the humanistic elements of the first and second season and this season just seems to be all action."
5,"Moving wave and moving my mind , it's great","I enjoy very much this band and in particular these album in the 70's ,and now the sound is very new and looks forever on these mad days ."
4,Good album by a forgotten progressive-rock band,"This is a 3-1/2 star album, but I'm happy to round up to 4 because it's good to see these albums available on CD. When I looked two years ago, I couldn't find anything by Focus for sale. Focus is a Dutch progressive-rock band that mostly does instrumentals, centered on Jan Akkerman's guitar and Thijs Van Leer's flute. ""Hocus Pocus"" is as good a novelty single as prog-rock ever produced, with its combination of power-chord guitar, yodeled verse, a vocal bridge that sounds like Popeye on uppers, and Tull-like flute solo. ""Janis"" is a lovely flute-based piece. ""Eruption"" is a long piece with several repeated riffs; in true annoying prog-rock fashion, each riff is given its own name."
1,Wrong CD in Package,"I ordered Moving Waves by Focus, and received a CD in the correct package with the correct photo on the front. However, when I played it, it was not the correct CD and did not even contain ""Hokus Pokus"", the primary I bought the CD. Somebody really goofed that one up!!"
3,pretty good,"you'll probably buy this disc for the same reason i did - to hear ""hocus pocus"" again. i can't blame you. i listened to the entire disc and it's not bad at all - a bit odd here and there, but not bad at all. i'll admitt this though, i'll probably play only ""hocus pocus"" 90% of the times i pull this disc out of the collection. but it's worth it. enjoy.space puppy, out"
2,Most Unsatisfying Album,"Aside from the classic, Hocus Pocus, and a few guitar licks in the last song, this is a really dull, derivative and unoriginal album. Not recommended."
4,moving waves... and you are still in commotion,"Very heavy. Disregard the negative unknowing , unappreciative comments of some of the reviewers. Focus was very early in""jazz- fusion"". Relisten to it, as with Emerson. Notice influences. Get Akkerman's and Van Der lindens solo lps. Hamburger lp live is OK but they were better than that live."
2,"If you wan't rock, you don't get it","If you are looking for more tracks like the ""rock"" single ""Hocus Pocus"", you won't find them on this CD. There is some good guitar work, but the cd is mostly slow and lathargic. Check out Gary Hoeys cover of ""Hocus Pocus"""
5,MOVE OVER; VIRTUOSOS AT WORK!!!,"Exquisita fusion de diferentes venas musicales en el marco del Rock Progresivo Europeo de principios de los 70'S. Great Album ranging from the sweetest ballads to the instrumental explotions on the longest track (23:04) ERUPTION, hard to describe, just to give you an idea: a blend of SANTANA,J.S.BACH,Deep Purple,VIVALDI,Frank Zappa,Chich Corea.A MUST for the real ROCKER of the world Una verdadera experiencia musical que te dejara los oidos felices"
4,pretty short but nice read,It gives another look at shrooms and growing them. It's pretty nice how the meaning is described; and the illustrations on the cover are pretty trippy on their own.
1,Very outdated method.,"Good book but it's outdated. This book uses a method that nobody uses anymore. Google for ""the PF tek"" to learn the easiest way to grow mushrooms with good yield and for cheap using readily available materials like brown rice, distilled water and jars, without the need for a pressure cooker.There are better methods like spawning to horse manure, casing with Miracle Grow Moisture Control and so forth. You can find more info on The Shroomery (google it) forums."
5,Industry Yellow Pages,Very complete information. Extremely helpful. Let's of sources and contact information. Definite must buy!
1,OUT OF DATE N A RIP OFF,I purchased this item and to my surprise it was horrible. All the hype associated with it. Then when trying to get a refund because the item was so out of date I got nothing back. It is a rip off folks. Most of the information on this is incorrect. The websites dont exist and half the clubs listed in the venues directory have been closed to date. This book is close to 3 years old and is tauted as being updated. It is not true. Save your money and find other means....
4,Bad movie vs. good movie,"The Beast from the Haunted Cave is a terrible movie. Besides the film being all washed out, the plot is long and drawn out. I could hardly stay awake for this snoozer. The beast is seen for a total of about maybe 10 seconds the entire film, and is genuinely scary looking; but not good enough to redeem the movie.The Brain that Wouldn't Die, on the other hand is a perfect B-movie horror flick. It's just so bad, it's good. You've got to see this one! A mad scientist-type loses his main-squeeze in a firey auto accident, but manages to salvage her head from the wreckage! He keeps the head alive, while scouting out the babes for a suitable body to attatch the head to! Hilarious! Although the sound quality is pretty poor, this is one classic that you CAN'T afford to miss.Skip the Beast, and buy this just for the Brain!"
5,It's what I expected,Well I kinda wanted to buy a generic but decided to pony up and get a OEM part. I didn't want to buy this hood again.
3,I guess its a good lens hood,"But I purchased it for my wide angle and I guess I'm not doing something right or the lens wouldn't make a shadow on all of my pics. I just don't think this lens should have a hood.Otherwise, it's like all of the rest of my hoods. Seems sturdy enough."
3,"Another ""great-to-have"" accessory to go in your camera bag","I bought this for my EF-S 10-22 lens. The wide-angle lens hood is pretty flat, but large in diameter. That makes it hard to fit in to my camera bag. I can't put the lens into the bag with the lens hood on. I need to detach it and put them in separately. Often, I just get too lazy to put the lens hood back on. I don't notice much difference anyway. I wouldn't say it's a ""must-have"" accessory. It does block out light and protect your lens. The build quality is excellent too. Yet, I think it's a little bit expensive."
4,Pros and Cons,"Pros:- Reduces flare and ghosting when shooting in bright light.- Helps protect your lens from dirt and scratches.- Somewhat protects the lens in case of a fall. Better to break the hood than the front element.- Makes you look more like you know what you are doing and helps to keep others from carelessly walking in front of you.Cons:- Will increase lens movement in windy situations, kind of like a sail on a boat.- Takes up more room in your bag, even when reversed they still add to the diameter of the lens.- People take more notice of you, will help to blow your cover if you are trying to keep a low profile."
3,"Works fine, but expensive","I always use a lens hood on my camera because they're cheaper to replace than a damaged lens should you bump into something. This hood works fine, but I gave it three stars for two reasons: first, it's a pretty flimsy piece of black plastic. You can buy cheaper ones but they weren't offered on Amazon at the time I bought the 10-22 mm lens. Second, the D30 camera and hood design have a flaw: you have to remove the lens hood when using the on-camera flash or it throws a shadow on your subject."
1,This lens hood is NOT for 16-35mm f/2.8L II,Under Product Description:This lens hood is designed for use with EF 16-35mm f/2.8L III got this for my Canon 16-35mm f/2.8L II USM lens but it is NOT made for it. I should have done my homework instead of trusting the false product description here. What I really need is the Canon EW-88 lens hood.
2,Canon Lens Hood EW83E,"It's nice to have the appropriate lens hood for what is a relatively expensive lens, unfortunately Canon take advantage of this desire and exploit their loyal customers with over priced bits of black plastic, this is one of those bits of black plastic that you will want but should never have to feel so ripped off when obtaining it. It fits very well,looks good, has a nice furry inner surface, but I suspect that it's shallow profile means that it will afford little if any benefit to the performance of the lens."
4,Required Accessory!,"Like all other reviewers, I have no clue why this hood is not included in the Canon EFS 10-22mm pack. Oh wait, 10-22 is not an elite ""L"" lens, right?! So, it is not worthy of having its own hood!Although this hood is expensive, you cannot use any other types of lens hood with this specific lens because of its wide angle of view. On the bright side, the plastic is made from high quality material, so at least it lasts."
3,Does its job,"It's a lens hood and does its job. It keeps out side flare and it acts as a buffer from bumps and scratches.Fits the EF 16-35mm and EF-S 10-22mm lenses.Like all Canon hoods, it always seems overpriced."
5,Amazing Lens Hood Stands up Great,"I got this Lens hood with my Canon EF-S 10-22mm lens which was an amazing lens. I got it for a trip to New York City. During my trip I had stepped out of a cab and accidentally dropped my camera, this lens hood took the brunt of the damage and stayed intact. Was worth the money I paid for it."
5,Groundbreaking,"Anyone with an interest in the emergence of Avant-Garde in Western classical music should read this book. Those with general interests in music -- in rock or jazz or ""world"" -- should also pick it up. Small's well-argued points about Western ideals and preconceptions of music -- especially its limitations -- are compelling. A classic in music scholarship!"
2,Small - an ingorant author,"Small makes a few valid points, but he seems too closed-minded. He critizes Western music too much and sometimes his arguments are just plain stupid."
5,"Suspense,action and a villain-this book has all three.",This book is full of suspense and there is never a boring moment.In fact it seems like a very well-written story until you realize that it is a documentation of a true event.I would recommend the book to people who want to see the dark side of human beings and the evil that they are capable of.
4,"""Houses Don't Have Memories"" THE TRUTH REVEALED!!!","Drug abuser and petty criminal who, in November 1974, shot his parents and four siblings to death at the family home in Amityville, N.Y. Suspected, but never charged, in the drowning death of another victim during 1972 (Not many people are aware of this fact!!!). Sentenced to life imprisonment despite a bizarre insanity defense. The DeFeo home has subsequently become the central object of novels and films in the ""Amityville Horror"" series, alleging that Ronald 'Butch' DeFeo was possessed by demons.This book presents the DeFeo case from the prosecutor's point of view. Especially revealing in regard to the suspect's lame insanity defense.I found the book to be of great interest to the student of criminology. If you are obsessed with the so called 'Amityville Horror' gibberish or are looking for ghosts, then look elsewhere, this book is definetely ***NOT*** for you. This is a 'serious readers' crime case study in line with Bugliosi's 'Helter Skelter'"
3,OSCAR WORTHY PERFORMANCES,"I bought this movie off amazon.com because i couldn't find it anywhere else. I grew into quite a Megan Fellows fan after her stint as Anne of Green Gables. She is an enchanting actress with an incredible gift. She deserves an oscar just for having such depth to go from portraying anne to Micheline, who is the total opposite of anne. She is amazing! Colleen Dewhurst was also brilliant in this movie. AS for the movie itself, it wouldn't be worth the $$ i spent, if megan weren't in it. it was a depressing story and had no real spark to help it's viewers want to keep watching it. It's worth it just to see Megan and Colleen... kudos to you both!"
4,The vibrant vision of Keith Haring,"Keith Haring, who died of AIDS-related complications in 1990, was an artist with a bold and distinctive style. ""Love"" contains many of his drawings together with the text of a poem he wrote.This is a beautiful book. Haring created an instantly recognizable style with his drawings. His portrayals of heart shapes, human shapes, and other elements have both an iconic quality and a life-affirming energy. Many of his drawings combine a mystical feeling with postmodern playfulness.My only reservation about this book involves a note on the page of publication data. It reads, ""The Keith Haring artwork in this book has been reproduced faithfully; however the colors of some works have been altered."" Huh? I see no need to change the artist's colors. I think the editors of the book overstepped themselves with that decision. Nevertheless, this book effectively captures the genius of Keith Haring, an artist who continues to inspire people all over the world."
5,The author persevered through a financial crisis,"Those new to personal finance concepts, such as young adults newly out of college, (as will many an adult in need of a financial mangement refresher) will find Let's Get Financial Savvy! by Lois Center-Shabazz to be an important and effective guide. The author persevered through a financial crisis and here imparts personal experienced based tips on how to invest, handle money, and protect against risky ventures. From online investments to mortgages, as will many an adult comes packed with charts and calculations."
3,Not so helpful,"this books has the typical info you would expect to find in any self-help financial book, no secrets revealed hear. Any person who sits down and REALLY thinks about there finances would come up with the same solutions this book would give you."
1,Thin and fragile rubber,"This rubber case is made out of very poor quality rubber: it is thin and very fragile, rips like paper.My friend has rubber case on his Berry, which feels totally different on touch, thicker and stronger. That rubber case is blah. Do not recommend."
5,Works like a charm!,"We do not have pie very often, but when we do it works great. Just right and can be used in other applications as well."
3,"Not so great, inflexible, very sharp","It is nice that the server will easily cut thru pie crust etc, but the first time I used it and was rinsing it off in the sink and slid my fingers down the side to clean it off.. I cut my finger pretty bad. So Id recommend going from the center outward (across the blades, rather than along them) when washing or drying. LATER: changing my product Title, and rating from 5 stars to 3 stars because it is so inflexible it just stabs the bottom of the pie pan and this makes it very difficult to get the server under the piece of pie, seems almost impossible to use, probably would be ok for cake on a flat bottom plate. Ive ordered a plastic-flexible server in hopes it will work better than this one."
4,"Good pie scoop, but a little spendy","I really like this, but it's a little expensive. Couldn't find a pie scoop in any stores around here, so had to buy it here."
2,Sloppy Workmanship,I received the 12 Fret Ultimate Guitar Chord Rubber Stamp and the large and mini chord rubber stamps as a gift. All three stamps were mounted crooked on their wood blocks making them just about impossible to get straight on paper. Absolute sloppy workmanship. I have no complaint about the Ink It Up! stamp pad.
4,Answers many practical questions - an important book to read,"The authors clearly explain the reality of the authority that Jesus has given to every believer. Great explanation of the difference between oppression and possession, and how to walk free of of every kind. I like how the book was laser-focused and got right to the point on each topic - a quick read, yet something likely to be referred to again and again. I like how the authors took a subject that many get ""weird"" with and simply taught and explained things as a good father would to his children. This book brings understanding to relevant questions that I think many people have. Highly recommended."
5,Dogs love 'em!!,I keep these treats handy during walks with my Sheba and Amstaff. Both love these treats and can't get enough of them!! Highly recommended!!!
3,Print Quality,"The drive-in double bill DVD concept is a good one, but the quality of the Blood Creature print is truly awful, with lots of jumps and scratches! Surely a better copy of this film could have been found."
2,Ugh...,"Note: I only watched ""Werewolf in a Girl's Dormitory.""The print was perfectly dreadful and ""Wereworlf in a Girl's Dormitory"" was a disgraceful piece of junk. This (shudder) Madacy DVD has a Popeye cartoon plus theatrical trailers, which barely manages to give this lousy disc 2 stars."
4,The Journal of Gen. Alexander,This is a very good book for those of you who are civil war buffs. Alexander has his own views about many of the generals and makes them well known. Some I do not agree with...for instance his views on Stonewall Jackson. Much of what he writes about is very interesting....for instance day-to-day happenings that others leave out. I would personally not give this book 5 stars but would recommend it for reading cw history.
5,THE reference for those who study flies.,"I am an Entomologist specializing in systematics. This is the first book I turn to when I want to identify any Nearctic Dipteran. It was written by the experts of the field, and it has not suffered much from age. The keys are very good (but with a few little errors), and each family covered is illustrated and described very thoroughly. This book has keys for identification down to the generic level."
3,"Good, but only because Gargamel is present","The dvd consists of 5 episodes. I do not understand why it takes months to release 5 episdes, at leasts with volumes I and II, there were 20+ episodes. I like this dvd better than the previous one- True Blue Friends, because Gargamel is at least one of the villians in 3 or 4 of the episodes. I would like for the next dvd to be Volume III consisting of 20+ episodes."
3,Only Five Smurfy Tales!,"Warner Bros. is continuing their lazy or should I say greedy streak in releasing The Smurfs to DVD. The could at least finish releasing Season 2, but instead they release a handful of episodes to DVD.The episodes are The Last Laugh, The A-maze-ing Smurfs, The Lost City of Yore, Johan's Army, and The Good, the Bad, and the Smurfy.Don't get me wrong, I liked all five episodes, but it annoys that Warner Bros. won't release more seasons sets."
3,Good,"I recently bought this album and its enjoyable enough but it would have been given 5 stars if it had the trippy music from Shogun Assassin, it only contains music from the Lone Wolf & Cub movies."
3,OK-old reference work,"What I expected... OK.I ordered an old reference work, and got an old reference work.No problems. Just fine."
3,Somewhat disappointed,"I am just a beginner in NT Greek, but I do know the alphabet, and have been disappointed when using this resource in conjunction with Thayer's Greek-English Lexicon, because the Greek spelling of the words (in some cases) don't match between the two. Maybe this is due to a fact that I'm ignorant of; if so, then I apologize - yet it still is confusing. Additionally, it is not coded to Strong's numbers (which is very handy if the spelling is not identical between two works)."
5,Ideal Introduction to Poetry,"This is a great introduction to poetry for kids. They selected a good combination of diverse poems. The different voices of the readers, the graphics that are interesting but not overboard, and all the kids who are interviewed are all valuable. I think that a younger kid (4 or 5 years old), who cannot quite grasp the poetry part of this yet, will be intrigued to see these kids talking about poetry and how special it is to them. That will draw them in more than anything else here, and as they get older, hopefully they will come to appreciate the poetry itself."
2,Well-intentioned but inconclusive and dated,"Chancer attempts to mediate between two sides of feminism, those arguing against potentially patriarchal-based activities like pornography and sadomasochism and those arguing that pornography and the like present an opportunity for sexual liberation and cultural growth. She successfully presents both sides of the arguments by summarizing the work of other scholars.But: That's basically all the book does. Chancer doesn't offer much of her own opinion, and where she does, she merely offers a rehashing of another scholar's work. This book fails to dive into the true tensions behind sadomasochism or pornography, and I found myself skimming sections in search of new, exciting ideas.This is perhaps a decent resource for someone studying the birth of third-wave feminism, but otherwise, the book is simply dated and fails to illuminate new ideas."
1,Turn on an episode of Survivor instead,Not sure about the author's agenda in writing the book - I just left like I was reading the TV version of a Survivor episode.There are many other books better able to offer Leadership theory.
5,One of Johnstons best collections.,"Not only did this book hold the expected humor and comedy, but also one of Johnstons most controversial stories. Lawrence reveals something about himself that no one would have guessed. A powerful series which took my breath away. This characteristically serious-with-tinges-of-humor strip is the best in it's league. It will truly go down as a classic."
2,Not particularly interesting,"eBook downloaded free from Gutenberg. Collection of short stories featuring mostly family events.While some of the stories had mildly amusing endings, none were particularly interesting. I got halfway through, thinking there would surely be a gripping storyline in here somewhere. There wasn't, and I quit. The title had NO connection to anything in the book. There were some minor spelling/grammar errors but nothing major."
4,Watch the wiring,"The plug was exactly what I wanted. BUT, when I hooked the plug up it flipped the breaker. I found that the factory had missed marked the positive and negative poles. The black screw indicates the hot and they had it on the ground side. As soon as I reversed the wires, it worked correctly."
4,pleased but not happy,"the package came in good order,good time&condition,but the flash suppressors that are shown in the photo,didn't come,nor did they respone to the email i sent them to buy the flash suppressors,poor customer service?if u see this review please get back to me re;price of the flash suppressors that come or can be bought with the ariakon acp 2.0 pistol,kind regards,gary wodiany"
5,great voice,Maura has an authentic Irish voice. I like the mix of songs on this CD. Can't stop playing it.
5,"Like the outdoors??? Hiking, camping, fishing, backpacking?","You need this book with you at all times when you are out there. It contains all kinds of life saving information that is invaluable if something bad were to happen to you out in the wilderness.The appendix features full color pictures of both edible and dangerous plants, poisonous snakes, and cloud types for forecasting impending weather conditions.The book includes first aid information, hunting techniques, shelter plans, and survival information for all types of weather conditions."
1,Not up to date,"This book does not address current survival situations (Natural or manmade). I recommend a book which would be fresh and offer tips on urban and rural survival as most will not have access to wilderness to ""live off the land"".Mr. Ron Foster offers a guide of firsthand knowledge (he is a first responder and trainer of such) that could save your life wherever you live when catastrophy hits without tons of survival gear. Just google Rural Ranger and read about it. Amazon carries it also. BE PREPARED PROPERLY!Seriously,David Highum"
2,Slogged through it,This is a very slow book. The idea of resolving two crime cases many years apart is intriguing. This book suffers from to much text. It is slow and difficult to slog through.
2,The books just plods along,"How do you rate good imagination but but so poorly related? I kept thinking it would pick up its pace. The pace picked up after half way through then settled back to a numbing pace. I loved the ideas of the two unrelated stories which combined lafer on. I liked the character depth. The handling of some sensitive topics were done well. Lets just say this story put in the hands of a different writer who could grab you off the pages and keep you compelled would be great. If you need something kinda interesting before you go to sleep this book is for you, it will not keep you up late. I fell asleep reading it a few days in a row."
3,A little cumbersome,"The author definitely has a unique plot, and I enjoyed the way he ties it all together. But there were periods where it seemed very long and drawn out. I confess to scanning these passages. I realize that all the court proceedings and legal research are necessary to the plot, but personally, I found most of this pretty boring, and somewhat repetitive. The key word in the description of the book is ""legal"" thriller. It just got too bogged down for me, but then, I'm probably just weird that way."
5,Hard to put down.,"Complex interaction of characters make this book fun to read. At times I found myself standing up reading this book while waiting for my wife at doctor's appointments. It lives up to its billing as crime, legal thriller and I would recommend it to anyone who likes that type of story."
4,Interesting,"When I started reading Past Imperfect I felt that I had made a mistake in downloding this book, but i was determined to give it a try and I am glad I did. The jumping back and forth in the 30 year span can get confusing at times and I found myself going back to earlier chapters to make sure I was following along properly. All in all I am glad I finished it and I did enjoy it even though it did take some time and drive to get fully into the story."
3,Past Imperfect,"Very slow to start,but a very exciting ending. Dominic a very passionate and interesting character. I would suggest this book to someone with a lot of patience. A long book!"
1,Couldnt get past 2nd Chapter,"I thought I was going to like this book, it has an interesting start but early in the second chapter I deleted the book from my Kindle and was glad I didnt pay for it. I was repulsed by several pages written with detailed description of the pick up and rape of young boy by a pedophile. I cant patronize an author that seems a little too intimate and comfortable writing in this way, it is not necessary. Could be a good book but I will never know."
3,Review,I gave this book three stars only because it had a lot of switching back and forth. The book got more interesting past the middle.It was a fairly decent crime story.r.sinclair
4,Surprisingly good,"I thought because this is a story based in France and involving the French criminal system I would not like it, but it was an excellent story with good pacing. There were times when I got lost in the switching between eras, but I think those plot devices were necessary to telling the story. All-in-all a surprisingly good, exciting and suspenseful read, with characters that were humanly faulty and believable."
3,Quick easy read.,"I kept expecting more. I'm sure the author did his research, but it just seemed such a simple story with a predictable ending."
4,Entertaining,"I found this book interesting since it had a ""different"" approach to mysteries. It is interesting the way the author brought in the concept of a spirit revealing itself to another person some 30 years later."
4,Page Turner,I would recommend this book to readers that enjoy a lot of mystery and suspense spread across three continents. Very well written and intriguing. A superb read.
2,Confusing,The story jumps around too much and does not connect well. I am reading it now and am having a hard time getting through it.
3,Intriguing plot/Boring delivery,"The plot of Past Imperfect is intriguing, but the author's style is so boring that by the midway point I felt as if I were marching through molassas."
3,Chevy Book,"Very nice book, however I have a 1926 Chevy and this book skipped that year for some reason. Great information on all of the other years and I understand some model year carryover from 1925, however it would have been nice to see at least a couple of 1926 photos and some data."
4,White Rashguards May Not Be Your Friend,"Please note that this rashguard becomes completely sheer once it's wet!!! Your Moobs will definitely show through it!!! That is my only caveat- if I had known about the sheer-factor, I would have gotten one with a color to it; perhaps blue.Otherwise, the product fits and works as advertised. It has been great for my swimming workouts. It also arrived in two days, which was faster than expected."
2,Small fit,"Although I did follow instructions for sizing the product, it was still way too tight. In addition, there were no return or exchange direction including in the package. I have attempted to email the company and have not received a response. It has been about 2 weeks. I am not sure what to do."
4,Fish w/out fins,Loved it...kept me warm in the pool...I suggest you do not wash in washing machine...will stretch out..hand wash in cold water.
1,JUNK!!!,"Air Compressor was defective out of the box. Could NOT extract 12 volt power cord from its retractable housing. After speaking to Amazon representative, I used as much force as I thought prudent to extract the cord and the insulation started shredding off the power cord. Also, the tire pressure guage is independent of the unit. It is simply a manual tire pressure guage that you twist out of its compartment and then press on your tire's valve stem just like any other manual tire guage. This compressor is a major disappointment."
1,piece of junk,This item caught fire and became completely useless the first time I needed it. Steer clear of this over priced piece of garbage.
5,Great Cooking,A great cookbook with unusual recipes which lend themselves well to a Mediterranean diet. And at a much better price than a retail store!
5,Songwriting at its best,"Tom Russell is one of the greates singer/songwriters I know. This cd, recorded in the late 80's in Norway, contains 12 country-rock songs, and each one of them is a classic."
5,Tom Russell Band -- not a bad track on the CD.,Can't believe it has taken me so long to find Tom Russell Band. Someone said just pick one -- you won't be disappointed. They were right. Except now I'll have to pick another one...
5,"Bialetti Replacement Gaskets and Filter Set, 6 Cup",Make sure you go on Bialetti's website to check out infor on sizes so that you buy the right size for your pot. Mine fits quite well
4,Exactly as advertised,Perfect fit for my Bialetti. Very good value. I would recommend if your coffee maker starts making bitter tasting coffee.
5,Fit my ancient coffee maker!,I have a Moka Express pot that was my great grandmother's from about 50 years ago and decided to try to use it. The gasket and filter were corroded and falling apart. I found this replacement set and took a chance and ordered it. The gaskets and filter are original-equipment quality and fit perfectly.
5,not been used,I bought this for my Bialetti 6800 Moka Express 6-Cup Stovetop Espresso Maker. So far it has not been used.
2,1940's Nostalgia,Boris Karloff certainly looks the part as the recently released convict named Gruesome. The nerve gas story is corny as is the bank robbery scene especially when one bloke is frozen just as he is about to sneeze. Ralph Byrd returns as Dick Tracy and he later starred in the early 50's TV series. People who are familiar with the B movies of the 1940's will recognise character actors Milton Parsons and Skelton Knaggs as a professor and his assistant respectively. If you feel like going on a nostalgia trip watch this.
3,"Entertaining ""B"" movie","I don't know what the prints from other ""public domain"" labels (Alpha, Brentwood, etc.) look like, but you can't beat this one for this low price. While you certainly have to lower your expectations whenever you get one of these public domain titles, this is much better than average (""average"" being washed out and grainy), so it's good enough for me. (All the Digiview titles read ""Digitally Remastered"" on the packaging. Ha!) This is an entertaining entry in RKO's short-lived Dick Tracy series, and a good example of efficient B-movie filmmaking."
1,"too bad it doesn't say how large ""large"" is. Life size? inches? feet?",I didn't buy this bc it does not have the SIZE. LARGE is not a good description. Other listings have size in inches. Too bad.
3,Spice Grinder,"I bought this item primarily for spices and have not used it for coffee. When I grind, I find that the spice dust flies out of the metal container and into the space between the plastic cover and the metal container. The mess isn't what bugs me though. Its that if i want to grind one stick of cinnamon, half of the cinnamon gets caught outside the metal jar, a quarter of it remains in pieces a bit too large for for my applesauce, and a quarter is perfect. Maybe using larger amounts of spice would help, but I don't need lots of spice at once. My solution is to take a piece of plastic wrap and cover the top of the metal jar before replacing the plastic cover.Kudos for an easily cleanable metal jar!Update: Started grinding coffee. I would say it grinds very well for a blade grinder. I have found that it works even better if you hold the lid on with one hand and lightly shake the grinder with the other while the blades are spinning. It makes a more consistent grind."
5,Satisfied Customer,"I've only had my KitchenAid coffee grinder for a few weeks so I can't speak to how well it will hold up, but as far as use is concerned I'm well satisfied. It's fast, easy to use, does a good job and (contrary to one review) makes very little mess.I don't, however, follow the recommended grinding time; I find it works for me if I wait until it looks 'about right' and then hold for another 2 or 3 seconds -- maybe 10 to 12 seconds total."
5,Awesome grinder,"This is the perfect complement to a cobalt blue kitchen. It grinds better then my old grinder, and with less effort. The press down on lid feature means I can leave it on the counter and not pick it up and hold it. The outer material proved easier to clean than my old grinder, as well. No nooks and crannies to accumulate kitchen crud, and it wipes very clean."
3,This coffee grinder is just ok .,"The cover doesn't seal well, some coffee bean powder will fall out. and the table will be a mess. But, what can I say, it's a really good looking product."
2,Pointless,"A mix of past history, plus a load of wildly inaccurate predictions presented as if this so-called novel was some kind of history book published in the 21st century. Wells acknowledges J.W. Dunne's Experiment with Time. It's not clear if this book was the outcome of Wells attempting to follow Dunne's technique in that book, or whether he saw himself as some kind of modern day Mother Shipton. Anyway, the only thing he gets nearly right is the outbreak of another war, which he predicts as starting in 1940. One example of the inaccuracies is that he states Poland would declare war on Germany and that the Poles would heavily bomb Berlin so that it would be like a primitive village afterwards. Elsewhere, he speaks highly of Lenin and goes on about the modern state being in control of life. In his Experiment in Autobiography he says he ""took great pains to make it as exciting and readable as anything I have ever done"". It nearly sent me to sleep."
3,Free SF Reader,"This book by H. G. Wells is only a sort of novel. He uses the device ofa man having, basically, prophetic visions of the future, to discusssociety at length.The discussion is about the future, and the direction that mankindis taking. Written towards the end of the Depression, this of courseinfluences the writing, as does the likelihood of further world war,also a prediction in the book.He continues on, as the book is divided into multiple parts, each looking at a different stage."
1,George Soros' wet dream,"I love several of HG Wells novels. The First Men in the Moon, the War in the Air, the Time Machine are some of my favorite literary works. Unfortunately, many of his later works were full of Fabian Socialist Utopian ideas that essentially say if the stupid masses would just get out of the way and the ""right people"" were to make decisions for everyone, the world would be a great place. Of course, in novels, these people never want anything but the greater good. Of course, in reality, everyone who espouses these ideals, such as the aforementioned Soros, really want wealth and power for themselves. As a result, this is a simpleminded and boring approach to a future history novel. If it weren't written by HG Wells, probably no one would pick it up. While the movie made from this book, ""Things to Come"", is worth watching, don't waste your time with this preachy and silly book."
5,Intelligently written,"I have read a lot of raw food books, and I believe this one to be the most intelligently written. Her style is a sort of layman's scientist, she doesn't approach the issue as intuitively as some might like, but this results in a book that appeals to the intellect and not to the part of us that are ""anti-the man"". She does occassionally stretch known scientific fact, but her speculations are educated. It is good for the person who wants to know WHY, not just how."
5,This Book May Save Your Life!,"My Natural Medicine practice specializes in the recognition and utilization of diet, nutritional supplements, acupuncture and detoxification. One of most patient's problems is understanding what to eat and when. This book COMPLETELY describes the types of food and why and how to eat them. Cancer, depression and autoimmune disease (to name only a few) like rheumatoid arthritis are the end result of chronic exposure to environmental toxins like solvents and pesticides AND chronic nutritional deficiencies from eating fast food and junk food. This is the most important book you can buy to teach you how simple it is to regain your health AND prevent chronic illness like cancer.This book forms the basis of how we should eat AND understand the life-saving principle of intestinal and liver detoxification. Read, learn, and live a healthy life!"
3,I was some what disapointed but it is still an ok book,"It seemed to me that they took just about all the health for diets out there and combined them. This is definitely not what I expected. When I saw the name ""Hippocrates"" I thought it would have taken the good things from his theories and compared them to the diets of today. But, it does have some helpful stuff about diets in there that I will keep it for my collection and not give it away. We all need to learn we have to have a little of most all diets in our diet and to use them in moderation to stay healthy."
3,Ann Wigmore,"Ann Wigmore she the best. Anything Ann does is great. Just learn from her, she knew what she was talking about."
3,Not thrilled with th is book,"I really am not too thrilled with this book it is almost impossible to to follow. I have been on health diet, not for weight loss, and this is the strictest so far.I suffer from hyperthyroidism and I am a raw foodist which helps my condition.The items on this diet are not the norm."
1,Wrong language,I ordered this book in spanish because I am learning Spanish. I received an English version of the book. I was very disappointed.
1,I don't think so,Another one of those parrot books and advice that just does not work in the real world.
2,Teaching Your Bird to Talk,"When I bought this book I thought I was buying a book that would help me teach my parrot to talk. Although I do know that there are no guarantees about which bird will talk and what method works, I wanted tips and advice on how to help my parrot learn.This books gives no such information. It covers why parrots talk, which parrots talk and lots of stories about talking parrots, but no real information on teaching my bird to talk. The only chapter I liked was the one about the Model/Rival-method, which is a detailed chapter on teaching a parrot to talk with cognition, understanding the words it uses. However, the bird must alredy be talking for this method to work.What I wanted was an answer to these questions: Do constant, out of context, repetitions work? Does plaing a casette work? Would it help to have talking sessions? Does my tone of voice matter? How can I get my bird to talk more clearly? How can I get my bird to talk in front of strangers?"
3,Good bird info but not a primer,"This book provides a wealth of information on birds but the title is a bit misleading. There is only one strong chapter on the ""hows"" of teaching a bird to talk with understanding rather than simple mimicry. The rest of the book details the funny things and the many things talking birds say(as reported by their owners), bird habits, nutrition, etc. I would have preferred a bit more in the tutorial section."
4,My parrot started to talk !,"I waited more than six months after I bought this book to try the techniques inside it before I wrote my review. Although I was using some methods mentioned inside the book but this book encouraged me to keep using them and also adds some amazing methods and ideas that were very helpful, useful and easy to imply. Simply, my old African Grey Parrot started to talk, and that was my fist experience in such thing and I really feel grateful to this book and to the efforts inside it. I am giving four stars since I feel some information are ideas need proves rather than facts. However, aiming to make your African talk, buy this book and be patient."
2,awesome when it works properly...,"Bought this for my parents and i was envious of it. sounds so good. then this past xmas i bought them an ipad and a cable so they can watch netflix on it from the ipad. this shuts off the receiver. turn it back on, a few minutes later it will shut itself off. google researched and i'm not the only one this happens to. it was working fine for a few years until the ipad was introduced, never once shut itself off. experimented, plugging into different inputs, testing voltage from the wall outlet, etc. no dice. super bummer"
4,Amazon Rocks...,Actually I bought this item for my Projector and it was not the right one I was expecting. When I sent it back Amazon has returned complete money back with no questions asked.Amazon is best for Customer satisfaction no doubt about it.I love to do business with Amazon.
1,Worst customer service ever,"Not only did my receiver break two months after I got it, Onkyo wouldn't help me at all. Try another brand."
3,The 575 does NOT UPCONVERT to HDMI,"The upconversion label on the 575 is misleading. This reciever will not upcovert component to HDMI. I bought this to run all of my electronics (PS2, DVD/Surround Sound, Camcorder, Laptop) up to my HDTV mounted on the wall, and it will not upconvert the analog signal to HDMI. It worked fine with the TV and surround sound, but not for the DVD player or PS2."
2,Beach Tent,I was not very impressed w/this product...It does not hold up well on the beach...Which was the point in purchasing it...
2,Sad Beach Mommy :,"I am sad to say this is a very cheap product. I was so excited when I ordered this tent for my 9 month old. We live at the beach, thus are constantly going. I wanted a durable tent that was easy to tote along with us to the beach to keep my daughter out of the sun. However, the first time we took it to the beach, my husband tried to put it together and one of the plastic rods that support the tent bent in half and broke. Needless to say we were unable to use the tent. I would look for a more durable tent."
4,Great for beach w/ young children.,"This item is great for the beach w/ young children. It was a place for me to let my 10 month old son, eat, and sleep while on the beach safley! It is kind of small for playing especially for two children but works great for a quick place for children to nap, snack, or take a break for the sun!! Also easy to cary and put together. I does take alot to hold down though when on the beach."
3,Beach Tent,"I like this product and would purchase it again. Just a couple of comments: (1)in a beach situation the tent needs more weight I added thee medium sized zip-locked bags full of sand and that solved the problem, (2) the mesh front works well except the ties need some help a small paper spring clip solves this issue."
4,great for infant at the beach,"used this for a week down the shore with our 6 week old...placed his whole carrier carseat in it to keep him out of sun and sand...worked great...very simple to put together and take apart...only thing that could have been a problem, but wasnt for us, was that you need somehting in there to weigh it down from the wind...the carseat was heavy enough that we didnt have to worry. but i could see this being frustrating if you have just a toddler lying down in there, so just throw a book , folded up towel, shoe, etc inside each corner and it should work like a charm."
3,serves its purpose,You get what you pay for. This unit serves its purpose for the beach days. The carrying bag is far too small so I had to get another bag to transport the unit.
2,All that glitters isn't gold,"I bought this to go to the beach, it doesn't have anyway to anchor it, so we had to use sand to try to complete the task. However, when a slight wind would blow, down went the tent. I would say that this should be rated for indoor play only. Too bad they didn't test this on the beach, then they could have advertised it properly, rather than showing it with two little kids sitting in it, on the beach."
2,better for the backyard not good for the beach,I bought this so my child could be shaded at the beach and have a place to relax. It is easy to set up but doesn't block much sun no matter which direction I turn it. We don't use it now but maybe when he is older he can play in it in the backyard.
2,not so breezie..,"the size was much better than i expected - very roomie. however, there wasn't enough air flow through the tent, it just baked in the sun despite there being a nice breeze on the days i used it, the air did not flow through the tent well. we never had the babe in it for too long (because it got stuffy) so i can't really comment on the adequacy of the spf protection of the tent."
3,Needs to be staked down,"I think the bottom of this tent would stay fully open easier if we had stakes for it. Took it to the beach for a few hours on a day trip, and even though we filled the sand bags, it kept pushing in on the back from a bit of wind and knocking the kid. When we go to the beach for a week, I plan to get something to more solidly anchor it in the sand."
3,"Good for size, not for sturdyness or sun protection","Overall, I'm happy with this tent because my main concern was size and for me, this tent is the perfect size for my 10 month old to sleep in while at the beach. However, there are a few points to note if you're looking to buy this: 1) you will still need an umbrella because the sun peaks through the screens hit the child directly while sleeping, 2) in terms of space, factor in that you will need to put ""weights"" (shoes, beach bags, etc.) inside the corners of this tent to keep it from blowing away. (The manufacturers should have included loops or tabs outside the tent at each corner so the tent could be secured from the outside instead of taking up space on the inside.) Overall, however, the tent is a good size and can keep out sand pretty well. I would recommend it."
1,Disappointed,After reading many reviews I chose this tent to bring to the beach for my 7 month old. After putting it up there was no way I'd put my daughter in there. There was no air inside the tent and it was so hot inside I probably could have fried an egg. This tent was definitely not made for hot days at the beach!
5,Perfect play tent,I chose this tent for my 9 year old daughter to play in indoors but it can be used outdoors as well for UV protection in the summer. It has extremely easy and quick assembly as well.
4,Beginner,"This is very good for the beginner, but if you illuminate or calligraphy on a regular basis, this book may be a bit boring.Does teach a lot of the basics."
5,The evolution of Californian society.,"This collection is made up of three seperately published full length novels. Each is a fictional account of life in 1) the gold rush, 2) San Francisco, and 3) Spanish land grant ranchos. My favorite thing about White is his ablility to convey the spirit of his settings and put the reader there. He wrote them between 1910 and 1920 and certainly received many firsthand accounts while preparing material. I think one can learn more by experiencing this one book than by taking several college semesters of Californian history. Please disregard the uninspiring title, the drama contained therin is increadible. Comparable to; Bret Harte, Mark Twain, Jack London, Frank Norris."
1,Alert,"Kingdom Hospital The Beginning, King Hospital Making The Rounds, and King Hospital Post Mordem are all included on King Hospital The Series."
5,Campy good watchin',"Loved it. It is funny, spooky and a great campy mini series/movie. You can tell from watching that the actors had a great time making it, too. I recommend it to anyone who thinks Stephen King is just t-o-o-o-o scary to watch. King's dark humor just oozes from this series. I'm buying my own so I wont have to rent it anymore."
1,Lied in description.,"lied about how long the dvds are. it is only 247 MINUTES. NOT 608 as is in the description. VERY disappointed. ALSO the day that i ordered this at 11.99 they lowered it a bit. and now just three days after I received it, it is listed at 8.49. VERY SAD will NEVER order from them again."
4,Kingdom Hospital,"As far as TV series goes this is quite a facinating watch, the characters are compelling, the effects are excellent, and the story is engrossing."
4,Just Right For My Cannon SX10 IS,"Like:Zippered top flap -- I don't have to worry about holding it upside-down.Clip-on shoulder strap -- no sewn-in straps!Subtle top handle -- I don't like Lowerpro's ""foam rainbow"" handles.Just enough space -- Fits the camera, spare batteries, charger, cleaning products, and cords almost perfectly.Don't Like:Internal divider -- You can only set it at 90-degreesNo storage in the top flap -- There's space! Lemme use it!Overall:I have little issues with this bag, but the price and size took care of everything I was looking for."
4,Compact bag for an HD camcorder,"When I bought my Canon HFS100 HD camcorder, I put it in my old Tamrac camera bag with other DSLR gear. But during a couple of long-distance travels, I realized I'd need a dedicated camcorder bag so I can carry my camcorder separately. Initially, I wanted to find a cylinder-shaped lens case (Lowepro) to carry my camcorder--this would have been very slim-shaped camcorder bag. On second thought, however, I realized I'd need a camcorder bag with room for extra batteries, memory cards and a power charger. So I bought this bag at a Wolf Camera store for $22.50 (the same price as Amazon). This bag is really compact for carrying my Canon HD camcorder and a few extra stuff. I'm pleased with my purchase. Highly recommended. The reason for only four stars is that the bag needs more functional divider and a shoulder strap pad. For the price of this bag, it may be too much to ask."
3,A bit too small,This video camera bag is a bit too small to hold all of the necessary equipment for today's video camera. The camera fits fine but there is no room for the battery charger and the camera manual (which you need to have on hand...unless you memorized yours!). There is also limited space for extra minitapes...I suggest you got for the bigger bag if you want to take all of your supplies with you when you travel!
3,camcorder bag is snug,"I got this bag for my new FS100 (which is quite compact, I think). I got all the stuff in there.....wires, cords, plugs, 2 memory cards, extra battery,....it all fits. Not much room to spare though,....so I wouldn't plan on using it for your digital camera as well,.....but if you want it just for the camcorder....then it's perfect."
2,Tamrac Video Bag,I bought this bag for our video recorder. It is a nice bag but way to small for a recorder. I kept it to use with my digitial camera. It is a perfect bag for a digital camera. I would not recommend it for a video recorder.
3,Pay attention to the dimensions,"I returned this bag because it was a lot smaller than it looked online. Otherwise, it would have been perfect."
3,Not King Kirby's Best,"I am a Kirby fan and was intrigued to read this - since it marked Kirby's critical departure to DC. But it really isn't for all readers - by this time, Kirby had become an acquired taste, and in all honesty, this absurdist version of Olsen just didn't feel like the right vehicle for his ideas at the time. If you want to know what Kirby was really up to - then his New Gods series is a much better work..a classic that truly defines Kirby's vision. Jimmy Olsen was just a pitstop along the way - and such an odd comic that never quite worked. Jimmy and Superman exist in Kirbyvision - but they never feel like they quite belong there. Should you get this? Only if you're a Kirby completist I guess."
5,Superb!,"It is sometimes forgotten that Roland Kirk was a jazz musician in the first place and not an entertainer who'd amuse the masses with playing, say, three saxophones at the same time. This album is a good reminder of what a fanatastic musician Roland Kirk really was. I personally think it is *MUCH* better than any of the stuff he released in the Seventies. But maybe I am a little bit too conservative - who knows? The album is a classic jazz album which features plenty of good compositions by Roland Kirk (""Three For The Festival"" is amongst them) plus a cover of a song by Charlie Parker. He uses the different types of saxophones for different songs, and it is very nice to hear the differences between their sounds. Any fan of jazz from the early Sixties will love this album."
5,Nana's Most Musical Offering,"Ma Verite is heads above her other CD's. Get this one while you can..... instead of a couple of winner types and the rest uninspired 'fillers', this one is first rate from top to bottom.By far my favorite!"
3,Pretty Decent,"Pretty decent karaoke versions of Brightman's songs.My biggest issue with this cd though is ""Harem,"" during the last movement of the song, the synthesizers are off & sound really out of tune. I can't believe they overlooked this. I'm disappointed because I was planning to use that song for a demo recording.[...] This site has some amazing songs to download instantly. The songs there tend to sound a little more instrumental as opposed to strictly keyboard/synthesizer, or at least the quality of the synth. is better.Hope this helps!"
1,Empty,"After seeing the Theatrical Trailor in Cinema I was very excited to watch this movie... oh boy, I was wrong!What's worth watching was the first 5 minutes of the movie! Yes, it all started good but then the plot turned out to be terribly weak!The best thing about this movie is the settings... but other than that there is nothing special.No suspense!No action!No emotions!No real marshal art!Nothing but flying people and boring story! You have to swallow the main myth of living in multi-verse that are copy cats of each other! If you didn't... you'd hate this movie as I did!Even the ending was weak... and if the producer is considering a part two, I'd advise him to reconsider again!"
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"This movie was horrible, I actually fell asleep during it. Even someone who can see a movie just for the special effects or martial arts will be disappointed. I felt like asking for my money back, this movie definitely wasn't ""The One"". Save your money."
1,Some Special Effects Should Be Outlawed,"Okay SOME special effects help a movie along, but when the entire movie is made of special effects that's a different story. Especially when they're BAD special effects.This movie was predictable, flaky and pathetic. Jet Li's martial art skills were diminished by this film's cheap special effects. I didn't care for Mr. Li's bland acting performance either. He is NO Jackie Chan and I mean that in every way. At least Jackie's movies and stunts move the story along. The stunts in the this film were to cover up for bad dialogue, a TERRIBLE script and even laughable characters. I got this movie pre-viewed and I'd give it away for free. I'd caterogize that part where he smashed the motorcyles together the WORST SPECIAL EFFECTS JOB I'VE SEEN. It was clear that most shots were at night so we wouldn't see the cords and strings and everything else they had holding objects up. Please!Skip this if you have any appreciation for decent films."
2,what a waste,A movie that had the right start but fails to finish properly.Not really that flash of a movie thats why i gave it two stars star.
1,Jet Li's worst movie,"This by far the worst Jet Li movie I have ever come across.Some fans are very harsh on Jet Li and say that all his American made movies are crap. I disagree, I think Romeo Must Die and Kiss of the Dragon are two of his best. This is probably the only Li movie I have seen that I actually could not stand. I think Jet Li is the best action hero we have. But this ""junk"" just lowers the bar for my enjoyment and expectations of Jet.I hope he doesnt except a role like this again. Where is Wong Fei Hung when we need him?..."
4,Good movie...Little Rewatch value,"This is a good movie but I suggest renting it first before buying it because once you watch it a few times you will not want to watch it again for a while. This movie does have very good fighting action and keeps you very entertained while watching it. It is deffinitely worht renting for any action movie fan, maybe buying."
3,lots of potential but failed to live up to the hype,"This movie has a great premise, full of all sorts of moral and philosophical questions, but it just didn't quite do it. Jet Li's acting was subpar. We all know the man can use his martial arts at a level of skill we haven't seen in a long time, but it wasn't showcased here. Instead they loaded the fight scenes with special effects, and not real great ones. And then to wrap it up in a nice, neat, sappy, cheesy ending. well, i'd say rent it and watch it, but it is not a movie that i'll be adding to my collection."
3,It's OK,"This film was originally offered to the Rock, I can see why he passed. This film has great visual effects it is totally awesome to see Jet Li swinging a motorcycle around like a flyswatter, but it seems to be lacking in the story department and the acting. That's not what you go to see an action movie for anyway right? I would recommend this for the eye candy and the sheer fun factor but leave your thinking cap home."
3,One Is Fun,"While ""The One"" is not a film that gives me a headache from thinking too much, it is a lot of fun. From the first moment, it picks you up in its action and doesn't let go until the last frame. Granted, if you start thinking too much, you might wonder what the alternate universe where Al Gore is president might be like; but if you just sit back it's a great little ride. The DVD version was not a great enhancement for me. The commentary delves into important issues like Jet Li's hair. Jason Statham who recently starred in ""The Transporter"" does a great job. In addition to these and ""Snatch"" & ""Lock, Stock & Barrel,"" he's developing a nice body of work. Delroy Lindo does a nice job trying to catch Jet. This is definitely for fans of the action genre who like interesting fight sequences. The ending sequence with sparks flying in the factory was also beautifully photographed in addition to being a great fight. Don't expect the world, but enjoy the alternate universe!"
2,if only there was less special fx and more jet li.....,"its hard for me to rate this movie, because i like jet li (kiss of the dragon, lethal weapon 4, black mask, they were all great), but the reason i liked those were because its all him doing the moves. in this movie, ..., i want to see jet li! not some special fx matrix thing. i sorta thought the story was a little too so-so as well. it didnt really make me care about what happens to the characters. i did like the jason statham chararcter tho! he's pretty much great in everything he's in, so thats a given. anyways, i really wanted to like this movie, but they didnt stick to an important rule, sometimes less is more."
2,Bring back Christopher Lambert - all is forgiven!,"I am a big Jet Li fan but I have to say that this film was terrible. It is also not very often that I say that about a film. There was not one bit of originality in the whole film. If you haven't already seen it, think of Highlander and Sliders, throw in a few Matrix style effects, mix them all together and 'The One' is what you end up with. Give this one a wide berth...."
4,Stop saying Matrix !!!,"Would you people stop saying stuff about the Matrix, please. It's hard enough to put that lousy movie out of my mind without everyone comparing everything to it. There were plenty of martial arts based movies with special effects before the Matrix, and every last one of them was better. So next time you see a character kick some one in slow motion, please, try and remember something else.As for 'The One,' it's a very fun movie. It never takes itself too seriously and avoids insulting you. I really liked the same scenes played over again with the slight differences. And when the end of a movie is clearly just an excuse to have a long shot of Jet Li kicking serious butt, how can you go wrong?To sum up; The One: very enjoyable. You: need to move on."
3,Hmmmm.,"This film uses a premise that is really cool. But it serves only as an elaborate backdrop for the action. Jet Li is an interesting actor. I did't really take him seriously until I saw Kiss of the Dragon. The idea that he actually has a wife that he cares for is unconvincing. On the other hand, this movie boasts some of the best action sequence special effects ever, like when he kicks 4 cops in the air before the first one hits the ground. Certainly a good rent."
3,Not for me,"It's Jet Li, how can you go wrong? Well with this one they did. There is plenty of action and very well choreographed fighting scenes, and the story is quite decent, but the music choice is what killed it. The movie producers decided it was a good idea to go with really generic and bad artists for the hard rock and metal elements of the songs they wanted. They really could have gone with better music, but other than that it's an ok movie."
1,"This is a parody, right?","Someone *please* tell me this is a parody. This is the same man who starred in the exquisite ""Hero"" and the well done ""Romeo Must Die""? If this isn't a parody, Jet Li should be ashamed."
3,The One,"This wasnt very a good film. It was OK. The fight scenes were pretty bad (Matrix-like with all the slow motion) and they looked VERY [poor]!But the only reason I'm giving it a 3 is the fight scene between Jet Li and Jet Li and the killer soundtrack.The soundtrack is awesome, with songs like; ""Down With the Sickness"" by Disturbed, and ""Last Resort"" by Papa Roach.But however, do not, i repeat, DO NOT compare this with Jet Li's Chinese flicks (like the OUATIC SERIES, TWIN WARRIORS, AND FONG SAI YUK, and so on) or you will be VERY disappointed, cuz this movie is TERRIBLE compared to Jet's Chinese flicks. This would be a good film to compare with Jet's American flicks, however (KOTD,LW4, AND RMD).So, if you wanna watch this expecting something like TWIN WARRIORS OR SOMETHING, well youll be very letdown. So watch this with an open mind and dont expect 2 much."
2,"Rent, don't buy...","I guess I was looking for a movie to pass the time... What I ended up doing was reading a magazine while half-watching/listening to this movie. The plot is rather unbelieveable even for sci-fi... Not consistent sci-fi. The acting is terrible... I was very dissappointed with Jason Stratham's performance after seeing him in Snatch. Jet Li should stick to martial arts, and not acting... I'm not a fan of Jet Li per se, but I do like good action. Some of the special effect fight scenes were great, and makes me recommend this for a rental... Or if you're really into Jet Li movies. Otherwise keep this ONE off your list. Seemed like it was too much of a ""promotion"" movie... Promote Jet Li since he's at a high point, Promote ""the next matrix"" style effects, and to promote ""Disturbed's"" new album. Just my two cents."
4,Don't judge Jet Li by this movie,"Even if you hated this movie and didn't like the way Jet Li acted in it, that doesn't mean you don't like Jet Li films. Go watch Twin Warriors, which is possibly the best Jet Li film ever. If you don't like that movie, then you probably won't like any other kung fu movies. Another good one is Jet Li's Fist of Legend."
2,good beginning but what a bad movie this was,"this movie was good at the beginning where Li kills himself, but another him in another dimension with some great freeze/stop effects and they he kicks them aside, mix in a little Drowning Pool and its all good, but then it just bores out with its lame pace and its wooden dialouge and characters, to the stricter sense, this should of been a hell of a lot more funner and better. though the end battle with Li and Li is great and thats what boasts it up to a two star rating. Carla Gugino, Jason Statham, Steve Rankin and Delroy Lindo also star, in which they cant save this one."
1,I'll give it One Star (and that's too many),"This movie is a waste of time. I saw it in a double feature with ""Serendipity,"" a romance comedy, which is billion lightyears ahead of this lousy movie.This movie's plot is cheap. To let two Let Li's fight each other, they used the ""parallel universe."" It's plain stupid. It does not hold a single drop of water. Now if you live in the same universe as the one I live, this movie is cheesy. I think some of this movie's praisers are actually from another universe. This movie is the worst thing ever, in this particular universe.Jet Li is a good fighter. He could fight. All the movie magics used in this movie, only weakened his supposed-to-be-solid performance. I heard one said with all the tricks used, they could get Julia Roberts play the leading role. You use so much tricks only if you can't fight. This movie wastes Jet Li's otherwise wonderful talents."
2,Dumb,"Skip this one. I mean, there's some alright action in it... but compared to Jet Li's other stuff, it leaves a lot to be desired."
3,Nice Storyline!,"I happened to see this flick y'day. What I liked was the storyline - the concept of Multiverses and the Balancing of the same excited me a great deal only to be thoroughly disappointed by the below-the-line performances. Apart from a few kicks, Jet Li is nothing in the movie. Wish they were more lines than the usual kicks and punches.Jet Li's twin in another universe is out on the run to become the one by intaking all the energies of the other look alikes in other universes. The last one left: Jet Li of course! There are multiverse cops, ways of execution, and the works.It could have been made better by a more gripping storyline!"
3,The One,"Well, I liked this movie only becouse of the special effects.The story line about 126 universes and that you live in them at the same time, well, let's just say that the story was kind of bad. I mean, what if one of ""you"" dies in an accident, or what if one ""you"" are in prison, while another ""you"" are married and stuff? The prison ""Jet-Li"" hadn't any wife, but other ""ones"" had... And that scene where Al Gore was chosen as president over America, I mean: PARALLELLS!The movie was like a fan movie, becouse the ideas weren't any good, and we have seen many of them in other movies. Anyway, I have this movie on DVD only for the special effects, none more.Bye."
3,Jet Lite!!!,"This is a very disappointing film for Jet Li.I'm shocked at how low brow the fights are,considering the talent and the huge budget they had.Too bad.I enjoyed the Wu Tang Clan's release of Yuen Woo Ping's early masterpiece `Shaolin Drunkard' much better. It had tons of extras and more believable action than this film-and that's not a good thing!"
2,Disappointing Jet,"I was fairly disappointed. Good thing I rented this ONE, instead of buying it. I don't want to own it. Oh well."
2,Stealing the power of the universes one by one.,"I wanted to like this movie, I really did....I saw a lot of hype around this movie prior to it's release, and it looked pretty good. I didn't get the chance to see it in theaters, but I saw it on DVD, and I don't think it lived up to the hype. The story involves alternate universes in that one particular individual has found a way to travel to alternate time lines, kill himself in these alternate time lines, and increase his own power by doing so. He is being persued by agents from an agency that regulates this type of travel and such. The action is great, and the special effects look amazing, but the story seemed to be lacking. I'm accustomed to this from HK action type movies, but seeing as how this was a Hollywood release, I guess I expected a little more. Lots of bang, but not a lot of substance."
1,I'm mortified,"I can't belive Jet Li came out with this load of .... it's his worst movie ever. Sure it has lots of action but it was too silly and predictable. Sorry Jet Li, stick to the real martial arts movie, you're not Vin Diesel."
3,"GOOD action, OK story line, silly movie.","GOOD ACTION, OK STORY LINE, silly movie.Get it if your action man movie.Dont get it if you dont like silly movies or ok story lines.I dont exactly reccomend it.....!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Good for laughs,"Well, I am disapointed. This is a movie to rent and watch it once but not to own. Please do not spend [the money]; for ""The One"" ! Get Shrek !!!cheers,"
3,JET LI,"I AM NOT FOND OF JET LI MOVIES, BUT THIS ONE WAS'NT TOO BAD. ACTION PACKED AS ALL OF HIS MOVIES ARE"
4,"This is, The One.....",Great action movie. Jet Li and Statham are terrific together in this multi-verse flik. The CGI effects are good and it has good story-line. Jet Li is just too cool of a fighter and yet you see him fight himself in this title. I thought it was very entertaining and action packed and would recomend it as should buy movie.
1,Poor packaging- Damaged Goods,"I ordered the dvd ""The One"",along with others,to be sent me, so that I could add them to a package for my brother in Hawaii. I noticed that the disc ""The One"" was loose inside it's case, but because it was a gift I didn't open to check it out. I realize now that I should have and I will be doing that with future orders. Once my brother reciceved it,opened it, he was unable to watch it because it was so scratched up it wouldn't play.When I tried to see about returning it, I found that I only had a few days left to return it. There was no way I could get it back from Hawaii in time to send it back to you in order to get my refund. There definitely needs to be more time for returning products."
1,awful taste,"I don't know how they did it, but this stuff tastes awful. Expiration was 2012, I tasted it today - June 2010.PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS - YECCHH!"
1,Sour,"I have to agree with the other negative reviews, and it may have to do with the 1% lemon juice added which is in the fine print at the bottom. I didn't notice this when I purchased it, but obviously when you buy something that says ""Pure Carrot"" on the front, that is what you expect."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS FOR YOUR PETS!!!,"This product contains CORN SYRUP. I have been adding glucosamine to my dog's food for the past three years and never before have I purchased a product containing corn syrup. I avoid this unnecessary additive in my own food, and would never expect to find it in a health product for pets. The industry is in serious need of regulation!!!"
5,compassionate look at an essential relationship,"While some might object to the overarching psychoanalytic tone, there is a lot to learn and enjoy here as the author incorporates personal experience, anecdotes, research and mythology into her account of the relationship between mothers and sons. I liked her early statement that having a son had moved her from a rigidly feminist position toward one that is more flexible and humanistic. The first section discusses the traits that are uniquely male, and contains chapters on male energy, male role models, male separation and love & sex. I thought this was particularly informative. The second section deals with various special relationships -- shared parenting, single mothers, stepmothers and gay sons. Final chapters deal with the mature relationship between mothers and sons.The author writes from experience and with compassion, and this is a worthwhile book for mothers (and sons) to read."
3,slightly old-fashioned psychology,"Overall an interesting read, I found Mothers & Sons to have an inordinate number of references to Freudian psychology and Oedipal situations. The book bases it's conclusions on actual psychological case studies and sometimes reads more like a doctoral thesis than a guide to raising a loving child. While definitely insightful it doesn't contain as much practical advice as I'd hoped beyond the obvious. On the other hand there is some commentary on what makes adult men tick that was very interesting."
1,Disappointing Purchase,"DO NOT go by the reviews of this product, if you search all the zorba the greek music reviews in all the different zorba the greek products, you will find all the same reviews. So the reviews are NOT specific to this product.I purchased the mp3 thinking it was the movie sound track as it is also linked to from the zorba the greek movie sound track page, and some of the reviews state it is. But the mp3's are NOT the movie sound track and do not include the movie dialog, to my great disappointment.If you are looking for just the music in mp3 perhaps the digitally remastered would be a better purchase.Zorba The Greek: Digitally Remastered, Bonus Booklet EditionAmazon is clearly using deceptive practices in their advertising and reviews submitted by users to make you think you are getting something your are not. Unfortunately I will have to purchase the digitally remastered version to see if it is any better than the faulty one I got stuck with."
1,Zorba the Greek CD Very Poor Sound Quality,"Back Biter's Zorba the Greek Soundtrack has very poor sound quality. From other reviews I expected mono sound, but the CD I received has significant static and fuzziness."
1,Zorba the Greek CD,"I first saw this movie when it came out (1963), and I was only 7 years old. Wonderful film, great music. The soundtrack on this CD, however, is terrible. I have an cassette tape I made in 1975 from my record album of these tracks, and the tape sounds better than the CD.Don't waste your money. It is shockingly bad."
1,Waste of money !!!!!!!!!,I can't believe what I'm hearing!!!This is the worst piece of music I've ever heard.I've also heard other Theodorakis Cd's and it's the same thing.Waste of my money.I think I'll stick with my good old Ennio Moricone's Cd's.I prefer real music...
3,Great Soundtrack with Not-So-Great Sound,"The soundtrack is spectacular but the CD left me with two complaints. First, I could do without the dialog introduction to every song. Second, the recording quality is far less than par. Less these issues, I would still recommend Zorba the Greek!"
4,Great find!,"I've been looking for this for years, and finally found it. The movie soundtrack is so much better than the musical/broadway soundtrack. The sound quality is pretty good for what it is- does not sound super hi-fi but does not sound bootleg as other reviews suggested."
1,"yuck, Yuck, YUCK -- save your money","Mono, thin, narrow band, with poor s/n level. I pulled out the cd and looked to see if it was a cd-r or rw someone had pirated from an old worn out 8 track or using a $1.98 microphone from Radio Shack."
5,Works better than great,"This little jewel works like a charm! Pour in just enough beans for two cups, and I have super fresh coffee every morning. No muss, no fuss, and no mess at all."
2,Could be Much Better,"I am the happy owner of a Kitchenaid stand mixer and food processor (they work perfectly). I bought this item based on my usual terrific experience with Kitchenaid - WRONG. Though its clean-up is a breeze (its dishwasher safe), its use is frustrating because all the coffee grounds leak out of the grinder. Clearly the great engineering design that went into their other products was not used here. However, I have discovered that a small amount of plastic cling-wrap placed on the grinder BEFORE the clear plastic cover goes on works wonders and prevents any spills from forming. Also, I do not overfill the grinder past the max. fill line in the cup, which, based on my Kitchenaid experience and its reputation, means it should not overflow."
3,Love Great Products!,"I have other KitchenAid products and love them but this one I am not real happy with. It grinds great and I love all the other features i.e., cover and stainless steel bowl come off for cleaning. But when grinding coffee the grinds come out of the grinder and I have to take extra time to clean up the mess. I plan on returning this one and see if KitchenAid makes another model."
1,Doesn't grind evenly--leaves whole coffee beans behind,"This product is not up to snuff by Kitchen Aid standards. The coffee grinder does not adequately grind coffee. It grinds some beans to a fine powder, while leaving other beans untouched. You can't get the grind inbetween, for a French press. In fact, you can't get any size you want uniformly. I usually put in about one inch of beans to grind enough for myself and my husband in the morning. It's disappointing."
4,"Solid grinder, sticky grinds",Nice solid construction. Grinds coffee well though my previous Braun ground the beans more consistently. Only issue I have is that the finer grounds tend to stick to the bottom of the grinder. I generally have to dislodge them with my finger.
3,"Grinds fine, but makes a mess","This is a decent grinder, but don't think you are movin on up to the cadillac with this model. While it does a good job grinding coffee, the shroud type lid dumps grounds onto your counter and more importantly onto the two little switches on the side of the unit. You activate grinding by pressing down on the lid, that is until the switches fill up with tiny bits of ground coffee. I almost threw the grinder out until I realized what had happened.Next time I think I will get a burr type with a hopper."
2,"effective, but messy","I have three other Kitchenaid appliances... a stand mixer, a food processor, and a stick blender. I purchased this because I had high expectations from the Kitchenaid brand name. I intended to use it to grind spices. Although it does grind very well, it makes a small mess. I ground cinnamon sticks into a medium fine powder. Some of the powder escaped through a gap between the lid and the base, coating the grinder and the counter. The good news is all this can easily be cleaned up. The bowl disconnects from the base so you can wash it. I cleaned the dust off the base with a pastry brush. Bottom line, this will do the job, but there are probably other units that will do it better (or cleaner)."
3,"If you like the Twins of the 60's, you'll love this book","This book makes great reading for a Twins fan like me who is starved for more information on the 1965 Twins. The book shares stories about some of the great Twin players of the 1960's that I've read nowhere else. The only reason that I rated it 3 stars rather than 5 is not because of the material in the book. It's because of what wasn't in the book. There should have been a lot more photos. Instead, there were small ""soft focus"" snapshots at the beginning of each chapter. The text is well written, but more large, clear photos of the players particularly off the field would have made the book come alive even more."
1,kind of bland writing,"I do love baseball books that look at a season especially one of a team with such interesting players as Cesar Tovar, Tony Oliva and Harmon Killebrew. Plus I thought I could finally find out just who this Zoilo Versalles guy is who won the AL MVP in 1965.Sadly, this book is beyond flat. I didn't find the writing at all engaging. Maybe it's the team itself. I mean, there really weren't a lot of characters despite many of the players who had character.I've also got to say I'm not having much luck with books on Minnesota's pro sports teams as the Klobuchar book (Knights and Knaves of Autumn) on the Vikings also did zip for me."
4,NCIS8,"Last episode of the season will not play on three different DVD players. Bummer!Otherwise, the quality was great. NCIS continues to do well in the ratings."
4,good season.,"i enjoyed season 6 & 7 better but still worth watching. Love NCIS!!!! This season did not have the same suspense that the other seasons have had. Each episode is more unique and individual than continual, till you get towards the end."
5,I love NCIS!,I would recommend this product to anyone. It is a great show and its really fun to try and figure out things with them. I would love working with them because they always have each others backs no matter what and they are like a family. If you like drama this is definately for you because the beginning and end of the season is very action packed and dramatic. I think everyone should give it a chance at least.
4,"GOOD CONDITION, WORKING FINE","Considering the item is used, the box is a little damaged, but nothing really noticeable, the DVD's are running with no problem till now (except for one of the bonus, that had some little problems, but nothing that made it impossible to watch, I suspect it might be my player), so I recommend this item for those who don't really want to pay the full price, the result it's almost the same as if it was new."
5,Excellent!,Absolutely great! I'd order again. Ordering from Amazon is easy and the shipment got here very fast. You can't do better at Walmart that's for sure.
3,Enjoyed.,I am an NCIS fan. Would recommend to my friends. I have all seven season of NCIS. It is always exciting
2,Not a Box Set,"I am an NCIS Box Set Collector and though the photo shows the normal box set, when my order arrived, it was all 6 discs in one plastic case. Collectors normally want matching box sets, not cheap reproductions. Just thought you should know. I did allow 2 stars for the value of the NCIS series and Amazon had no problem refunding my returned purchase. It was just a hassle and disappointment."
2,Crappy DVD quality,"The scripts, direction and acting in season 8 are great as usual. But what has happened to the DVD production quality? It's worse that VHS!! I bought the full set from Amazon, then to double check, I ordered the first disc from Netflix. And that one, too, had the same crappy production quality.Doesn't anyone else see this??"
4,"Great series, poor recording","I really appreciated the quickness in getting my order shipped out. I was, however, disappointed with the recording quality. The TV series is shown in HD, but this has the appearance of being a recording of a recording. Very disappointed."
5,Big Fan of NCIS,"I have all 7 previous seasons and am eagerly awaiting the arrival of this one. I watched it on regular television, but still can't wait to watch them all over again. Mark Harmon and crew are the best. Hope this show goes on for many years to come."
1,Not Pleased,Atleast the first two dvds are splotchy and only play smoothly occasionaly. I gave up trying and will have to purchase another. very dissappointing :(
5,NCIS Season 8,Excellent TV series. Something this has the other CIS programs seem notis the way it's not all blood and guts. The way the show includes personal life'sand on the job life's is why I enjoy it so much.Serious but yet comical.
5,NCIS season 8,"Great DVD, in excellent condition. I am a huge fan of this show and I love having the DVD's in my home."
5,NCIS - The complete 8th Season,The ordering process was easy and safe. I recieved the DVD set in a timely manner. The service was excellent. I will order again from Amazon. Thanks.
5,NCIS Season 8,"NCIS: Naval Criminal Investigative Service has been following an uncharacteristically intense multi-episode arc as of late. It centers around the infamous ""Port to Port"" serial killer, who the Naval Criminal Investigative Service has been looking into for the last four episodes. The CIA, via Ziva's boyfriend Agent Ray Cruz (Enrique Murciano), is also assisting in the investigation. E.J. Barret (Sarah Jane Morris, Brothers & Sisters) is a guest field agent who's been tracking the killer for months."
5,Favorite tv series,The dynamic of the relationships with characters draws you in and keeps you hooked. This is my favorite series hands down based on the repoire of the characters and what they each bring individually as actors/ actresses-
5,Love it!!,I love it! There is nothing bad to say about it! I would recommend to any die hard NCIS fan!
1,DVD first disk damaged,The first disk in season 8 was damaged. I followed instructions to return the dvd set and asked that it be replaced. I did not get a response from the seller. If he didn't have a replacement thne he should have refunded my money so I could buy another set.
2,Running out of Luck,"Really not the same quality of storytelling as the earlier seasons - the overarching storyline isn't there - or isn't strong enough - and viewers don't care about the characters like they do in Seasons 4-6, probably NCIS's Golden Age. Back then, the show was witty, smart, and creative. Now it's just same-old, same-old, and the new characters they try to introduce, we don't like.Oh well. Everyone runs out of luck sometime.(By the way, I love NCIS. If you haven't watched it, I really encourage you to see seasons 4-6. It's just lost its touch.)"
2,ncis8,"totally love this series but i had a problem with one disc. evidently it had a minor flaw or scratch and it made watching that one miserable. other than that, it was great."
1,NCIS,"I bought this season for my dad for Father's day. I first purchased it used and two of the discs would keep skipping or didn't work at all. So, I bought another one new with the factory seal on it. Again, the same issue with different discs this time. I don't know if it was just an error from the company or what is going on, but I don't recommend you buy this season from ANY Amazon seller."
5,Best Cap Gun We've Played With,Best Cap Gun we've played with because you load a round of 12-shot ammo and fire away! The hammer hits hard and the gun fires loud with 12 consecutive shots. Load properly and this cap gun will last for years. A definite favorite made in Spain.www.thecandlestickmaker.com
1,Broke in a week,"My five year old loved this gun. Regardless, the scope broke off of it in a week. It isn't made well at all but it was fun for a week!"
3,Good gift. Cheaper made.,It was a little less quality than the pistol that I purchased that was the same brand. I thought that the barrel would be like the pistol's is (metal) but it is not. It is plastic and it did not take long for my 5 yr old son to break the scope off the plastic barrel. This is a okay product I just expected a little more for he money.
2,Wasn't worth the price,"The first time grandson dropped it, the scope broke off gun. I super-glued and taped it together but it wasn't worth the price."
1,Bad quality,"This item was obviously made to fool people into thinking that it is practical...it sound practical, but it does not reel back in and it did not fit into the Palm connection port. So, I threw it away!!!"
2,You'll learn Flash alright....but it'll bore you to death!!,"It's very educational but the contents...yuck. I want a book to INSPIRE me to USE the program i'm learning, this book has text that'll put you to SLEEP and illustrations a five-year old could have done better. The only thing that keeps me from giving it an ""ABSOLUTE SUCKS"" review is that you ACTUALLY(!) learn from this book, so if you buy this you'd better be stubborn about learning Flash, otherwise i'd wait until a better, more creatively inspiring book comes along. Learning: 4 stars, Fun: 1 star"
4,The Cell Games Saga,"This DVD here lacks of fighting, but does have a certain interest leading up to the middle of the saga. It's about when everyone finds out about the Cell Games and decides to train while Goku and Gohan wrap up their training sessions in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber. This is a cool DVD and I hope that the other parts of the saga are out on DVDs soon."
3,The start of another filler portion,"This tape starts the filler episodes in which the Z fighters have ten days to prepare for the Cell Games.Content: C+Animation: B+Music: B (dub)English Version: BFight Scenes: CWell, I can't really say this is a highlight of DBZ. Probably the only good points are when Cell makes his declaration of the Tournament. We also get to see the first appearence of Mister Satan (a.k.a. Hercule). In this volume, Goku finally meets the completed Cell and Gohan meets a girl named Lime. There is also the return of Goku's old nemesis General Tao. These episodes are basically character development episodes. But if you want to watch a show about martial arts and action, what the point of these episodes? Did the writers get tired? Anyway, I would recommend buying this tape, but than wait for the Cell games to actually start for the next volume."
3,reply to review,"I agree with the first reviewer. It does lack of fighting, but it does have a certain interest leading up to the middle of the saga. What they've should've done is wish android 16 to be human instead of fixing him up. If that would've happened, then they could've used to namekian dragonballs for the wishes. by the way, why did FUNimation stop here with the DVD saga? I want to see the rest of the Cell Games saga!!!!"
4,just call it cool ll y.a kids review,"I like it. Sure it lacks of fighting,and you have 5 minutes of talking, and that sucks but yamacha and krillin train in a really funny way. And gohan has this hilarious dream but i like it because cell goes is this studio b? and then the guy goes, of course it is! Call security, hurry! And then every thing goes funny. Im telling you, get this."
1,Class A Bore Factory,"""Well, we dont have much cash left, so lets do an episode where Kirk and party make use of our empty soundstage. Lets throw in a mute so we dont need to waste money on extra dialoge, and how about a torture scene for Kirk, we haven't done that yet?""No.. I'm not kidding.. that's the plot. You simply cannot get through this episode without dozing off. Even poorer episodes such as ""The Way To Eden"" have a certian campy charm that allows you to overlook it's low budget weaknesses somewhat. This one doesn't even have that. I understand that Deforrest Kelly named it his favorite episode, but I will never get why.The worst episode of the entire series."
1,THE WORST 3 SEASON EPISODE OF ALL!!!!,"I'M VERY UNHAPPY THE STUDIO EVEN AGREED TO MAKE THIS PIECE OF JUNK AFTER WINK OF AN EYE . HORRIBLE STORY! VERY BAD ACTING! THE TITLE WAS A JOKE. AN THE VIANS SHOULD NOT BE ALOUD BEHIND A CAMERA! GEM WAS A VEY LAUGHABLE NAME. IF THERE IS ONE 3 SEASON EPISODE THAT SHOULD BE WIPED OFF THE TREK TIMELINE, THIS IS THE ONE!"
5,"Good Book, though not the absolute best...","As I very clearly stated above, this is a read-worthy book, though not my favorite or one of the best books that I have ever read. If you're in the mood for some feminist action or any politics, go ahead, pick up the book. This is, however, NOT a book for anyone who's looking for comedy."
5,Top of the line,"I was weaned on maritime espionage novels in the tradition of Alistair MacLean. ""The Blue Ice"" is probably the best of these I have ever read -- superlative in every way. Icy Norwegian atmosphere, excellent characterizations, strong plotting. Thrillers just don't get better than this one!"
3,"Not bad, but not great","The voice of MR.Conley was not what I expected. I had in mind a voice more like William Matteuzzi, but sadly that was not to be. Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy listening to it, but he does not have the high notes like I was told. Also it might be well to remember that the recordings are from the late 40's to the early 50's. So the sound quality is a little lacking."
5,The best clarifying shampoo for any type hair,"I have normal, fine hair. I use this as a clarifying shampoo when I'm going to use hot rollers or a curling iron so the hair isn't so heavy with conditioner buildup. Love it."
1,Not for me,"I have greasy hair and I was using the Suave clarifying shampoo which worked well. I thought I'd try this one base on recommendations but when I washed my hair with it, my hair came out still oily! It was like I hadn't washed my hair at all!! Ended up throwing it away, not happy with it at all"
3,Bert Kaempfert's labor of love...,"Recorded in October,1977, this was an album that Bert had looked forward to for years. It's to bad that it suffers from such a cloudy and crowded recording. I've listened to two CD's and one LP of this record and they're all the same. More soloist on this one than most, with Jiggs Whigam and Herb Geller contributing excellent solo work, unfortunately showing what a lightweight Ack Van Rooyen really is. It's not that Van Rooyen can't play, but a trumpet would have suited this classic material so much better than a his fluglehorn. This was Bert's next to last record and it features some of the most demanding arranging of his entire recorded career. A must-have for the hard-core and a good listen for the casual BK fan. If anybody still thinks that Bert Kaempfert's career ended with ""Afrikkan Beat"", this CD is only one of many pleasant suprises."
5,Fantastic renditions !,Take it from a serious Bert Kaempfert fan.This is the band at it's best and every number which is dedicated to the 1940's swingtime era is done with that terrific style synonymous with Bert Kaempfert and his stellar brass section.What marvellous musicians.Listening to this album may convince you that this was the greatest band section ever assembled to making an album.Get it !
2,Dino Thunder Sleeping Bag,"My son loved the idea of a sleeping bag but it's not very comfortable. The fabric is very slippery on the outside and sticky on the inside. His pajamas stick to the fabric when he tries to roll over and the whole thing twists around him. He likes to play in it but not sleep in it. A good ""toy"" but not very practical."
4,good for the price,"Got mine through Gold Box deal, so it was a great price. It worked like a charm once I figured out one small detail that they left out - once you find the programming code you don't check to see if it's correct by hitting the number keys, you check by using the up and down channel keys. Once you ""set"" the remote, the number keys work fine. It took me a while to figure this out.My only other complaint is that I cannot seem to figure out how to change the size of my PIP, which my old (dead) remote could do. Otherwise, it works perfectly on my getting very old Panasonic TV and VCR/DVD player."
2,learning remote,"good product, however it does not work with all TV's, I have a Sylvania and an Emerson, both digital tv's and this remote will not work with either one of them."
3,Can't control older Echostar satellite receivers,"I bought this after doing much research, but nothing I had read indicated that it wouldn't be able to control my older Echostar satellite receiver, the DishPlayer 510 (DP-510). Many sources (including the manufacturer, URC) attribute the problem to the DP-510 needing a UHF remote. But the fact is that the DP-510 can be controlled by both UHF and infrared simultaneously (i.e., there is no mode or switch you set to tell the receiver which type of signal to pay attention to). I've been using this receiver for years using primarily infrared (via sensors and flashers) to traverse the three floors of my house.Anyway, it appears that the DP-510 uses infrared signals at 57 KHz range, which this remote does not put out. I've ended up with a OneForAll 8820 remote, which is controlling my satellite receiver just fine, and which has at long last allowed me to have only one remote to control my audio/video setup."
5,MEB,"This is basically an entry level remote but has some great features. Fully Backlit and Learning, feels good in the hand lay out of buttons. You willn't go wrong in buying this remote I just bought two."
4,useing URC R7 remote,"i bought it because i accidently threw out my dvd remote and needed a preprogramed remote. the first one was defective, a phone call to amazon and a new one received in 4 days, they paid shipping on old one i sent back. great customer service. the remote works fine and have had no problem with it."
2,not universal enough,"Pros: sturdy, illuminated buttonsCons: those nice, sturdy, illuminated buttons don't do what I want. the pre-programmed codes were sufficient to get basic functions working on several devices (TV, VCR, receiver, DVD player), but when I tried to get this remote control to learn some other functions on my Denon AVR-3000 receiver and Sony XDR-F1HD tuner, it refused. I followed all of the tips in the owner's manual: I put new batteries in both remotes, I turned off the fluorescent lights, I moved the remotes closer and farther, I tapped the button instead of holding it, I stood on my head (just kidding). I tried dozens of times with no success. So I went to Radio Shack and bought the cheapest learning remote in the store (Radio Shack 7-in-1 Universal HD Remote Control); it learned those functions on the first try. I wish it had sturdy, illuminated buttons (it doesn't), but at least it works."
2,Not all functions work,"I've tried programming the R7 to control my Sony Wega TV by each of the 3 methods (and with all possible settings for the macro power function) and it always power cycles the TV when I select that component. Tech support was friendly, but wasn't able to help with this problem. Probably not good for the CRT. Otherwise it works fine."
4,Easy programming remote,"This is a very good remote (at this price range.) I just use the ""learn"" function to setup Samsung TV and Lite-On DVD player/Recorder (Yes, my Lite-on is not a PC DVD ROM and it's a standalone DVD recorder. Unfortunately, Lite-On has discontinued standalone DVD recroder.) The setup time is less than 10 minutes for both devices."
4,A good inexpensive remote.,"I had three remotes for my entertainment system and the remote for the volume control was on it's way out and I had to find something to replace it. I figured this would be the time for one remote to replace three. I did a lot of searching,reading reviews and pricing. I purchased the URC R6 first and I was really pleased with it but I really wanted a remote with back-lighting features so I went looking again. I found the URC R7 and ordered another R6 for my wife's room and I use the first R6 for my computer room. The R7 is really a good, all around, remote but I kind of liked the four ""My Favorites"" buttons that the R6 has. I've had the R7 since the end of November and I am glad I purchased it and would recommend this remote. My wife can even use it. And that's saying something for this remote!"
2,Does not work with many satelitte boxes,"If you have a dish network satelitte box the chances are slim to none that this remote will work out of the box. The problem is that code 122 doesn't work and there is no working code for dish in the remote. You will have to make it 'learn' every key on your old remote. Not all that hard, but it took over 20 try's for it to learn the info button. Quite a pain, but what really made me give this product only 2 stars is their technical support (or lack there of). After having the same problem with 2 different R7 remotes and being told several times by their technical support that it was a problem with my sat box, I borrowed an R6 (also made by Universal) and programed it with the 122 code. It worked perfectly. After confronting their technical support with this proof that their is something technically wrong with their programming their response was that I should buy an R6 instead. Dah, this is technical support?"
3,Good remote does the job.,"This is a fine, inexpensive remote that seems to work well but has minimal programming features. It does work all my equipment and most of the equipment features. One big drawback is the ""One Button"" on/off function. Once you program it to turn on/off the equipment, there is no capability left in the remote to turn off/on the equipment seperately. A rather big drawback if you are finished with one piece and not another or if one piece of equipment fails to come on."
2,This product may have reliability problems,"I was very pleased with the difference this product made in my home audio system, but about 16 months after purchase and regular use it stopped working. The repair was very costly, and the source of the trouble is still unknown."
3,not a review as such,"Since I see a lot of people complaining about these subs, I just want to make sure people are setting them properly. Before you hook the sub up, slowly turn up the volume on your other 5 channels until they are as loud as they can go without distorting. Then disconnect those speakers and hook the sub up, keeping that volume the same. For the crossover, check the frequency response of the sub, and then set the crossover to slightly lower than that to give it some leeway (like if frequenct response is 20-150hz, set it to 100hz or 125hz) This will minimize distortion from the sub since it won't be trying to play notes that are almost out of it's range. Now with the sub hooked up, start with the gain at minimum, and slowly turn it up as high as you can without it distorting. Turn the volume back down, hook your speakers back up and enjoy. Taking these steps will optimize the quality of sound, and will keep your amp and sub running longer since it won't be overworking itself."
2,Strange Buzzing sound and then it stopped working,"This subwoofer worked great during action scenes, but during the quieter scenes it had a really annoying humming sound coming from it and it made it hard to concentrate on dialogue. I played with all the dials and made sure the wires were plugged in correctly, but it didn't help. After the warranty expired, so did the subwoofer. I have to give the subwoofer a rating of 2 stars because it did perform well during action scenes, but that is the most I can give it. I will never buy KLH speakers again. It wasn't worth the aggravation and added expense in the long run."
1,"A Horrific, Disgusting Movie","I could only bring myself to watch the first hour of this horrific, disgusting movie. This movie is done in very poor taste and graphically depicts unspeakable events (young children being shot point-blank in head and graphic rape). I highly recommend NOT watching this filth. It tries to be philosophical, edgy, and artsy but fails and ends up just being gross. It pollutes your mind and the graphic scenes are scarring."
5,Definitely worth your time!,"The main character is a little slow to figure out which woman is right for her but with three women interested in you, who wouldn't be a little confused? Great story development and romance!"
4,To be what is expected,"What can I say that hasn't been said all ready. It's a classic Kallmaker story with all the goodies that come from her: steamy, realistic and trustworthy characters."
1,no pictures its a waste of time and money,"This book is without the illustrations. Useless. It seems almost fraudulent to pretend to publish a book about pictures and which references the pictures in the text, then not include the pictures.What the heck are they trying to do?Don't waste your time or money, go to woodblock.com if you want to find out about Japanese prints, Its free and complete."
4,Working great so far!,"This item was priced great and arrived quickly. The finish wasn't great, but I plugged it in and it has been functioning great! I'm very happy with the value."
3,coffee grinder,"the grider itself is just an ok grinder. I am more concerned with amazon with all of the hyoed up other charges which they do not tell you about. I am still waiting for the credits that amazon put on my card. Needless, unuseable charges."
3,Uneven grind,"I bought this grinder for a couple of reasons, based on some of the other user reviews. First, I love that the grinding chamber is removable for cleaning and emptying. It's not exactly unique, but it's useful nonetheless. Many of the reviews that I read said that this particular blade grinder had a very consistent grind. With my experience over the last month since I've purchased it, this is simply not true. The grind has been very uneven, with some very course grind mixed with parts that almost like powder. This is probably the most important part of an appliance, so if you're looking for the quality of the grind, look elsewhere.This machine does have a good, powerful (and probably long-lasting) motor, however, which is great."
5,Love This Grinder,"Heavy duty would be an understatement. Actually built like Kitchen Aid used to be. Very impressive multi-use grinder. A bit noisy, but who cares..."
3,Cool Messy Beauty,"Yes, it has a cool modern design that looks great in your kitchen. It has the Kitchen Aid name stamped on the front to give you that ""Yes, I am a cook, I know what I buy"" appeal. It cuts fast through coffee beans into a fine grade for your morning java, but what a mess. There are only 2 of us that drink coffee at our household, making 2 cups each weekend morning, therefore the size of this machine is not an issue, but there is a big major flaw with the design. I believe the clear plastic cover cup that fits over the stainless steel container needs an EPDM or Neoprene gasket ring to stop the coffee grain from spilling unto the kitchen table. We use a simpler solution; we place a napkin under the grinder to collect the dust. When the grinder is finished, we empty both the container & the napkin into the coffee machine. Compare the other brands or models before going for just the brand name."
3,"Great For Spices, Not For Coffee","If you're in the market for a spice grinder, this is it. It does an excellent job of grinding everything from pepper to Herbes de Provence.Additionally, because the cup is removable, it can be washed, thus avoiding any transfer of flavors between spice batches.NOTE: While it grinds spices well, don't try to chop fresh herbs. For that, I use the mini-Kitchen Aid food processor.Unfortunately, the grinder doesn't work so well with coffee. It produces an uneven grind for some reason and, because the cup isn't that large, tends to send grounds flying. Instead, I'd recommend the Krups Fast Touch."
