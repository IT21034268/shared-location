1,"Disgustingly homophobic, misogynistic, and vulgar","If you have even the slightest liberal conscience--if you care about women's equality, if you're disturbed at the outrageous culture that leads to so many of our young black men choosing lives of crime and incarceration, if you embrace a philosophy of love of all people as equals, if you agree with the idea that violence only spauns more violence and hatred--you will quickly be revolted by this juvenile and dangerous adolescent boasting.Embrace of this trash does not speak well for hopes of a progressive, democratic, inclusive, and deliberative society."
5,Viva La Revolution!,"Immortal Technique is the realest rapper underground or mainstream. This album is Malcom X's message mixed with the 9/11 conspiracy twisted up in the vocals of a menacing emcee not to be slept on. This album also tackles the ""corporate tentacles"" that have a chokehold on most other hip hop artists and their gimmicks. This album is groundbreaking, legendary, and classic. After your first thorough listen, you'll look at hip hop in another dimension. And your mind will LITERALLY be in another dimension. This is not recommended for the simple-minded. This is recommended for the real, from those with a doctorate degree to those on death row.The revolution is here, you ready?"
4,Wow!,"I'm glad I got wind of this guy when I did. This is one hell of an album, 4 stars because of a couple of weak produced tracks.Lyrically 5 stars, one hell of a rhymer. Controversial and deadly and you just can't stop listening to him spit his lyrics.Don't hesitate, pick this one up."
4,Most slept on rapper around,"What's this? Is someone rapping about something... that matters? Now? In the days of bling and BET/MTV booby videos? Wow.Immortal Technique is something rare to come by these days. Great lyrics, skillful rhymes, and real passion about life and music. If only the beats were a bit better, this would be a five star album. Regardless, it's still a must have CD in these times of ridiculous club hit garbage and underground dictionary wordplay.Oh and the guy rips it live like you wouldn't believe."
5,one of a kind...,"hip hop has always been an ""in your face"" genre of music. technique does a fantastic job of throwing everything he has into the listener's face. one listen to him and you know that his lyrics are not simply meant to be heard, they are meant to be thought about. i do not agree with every thing that he says but i respect his right to say it and i can see his perspective. these days it is rare to find a rapper so passionate and fiery. technique is not afraid at all of anyone or any criticism and this makes his music better. there is no one similiar to technique out there and i cannot wait to hear more.by the way, technically, this album is great as well. the beats are impressive and technique's flow is forceful and always on point."
5,The Revolution will begin now...,This man is the hidden hip hop artist that will be revealed to all. I challenge anyone to listen to this and not like it. This man is an intellectual as well as a lyrical master. On top of that - those beats are phat! Check him out now!!!!!!!!!!
5,Immortal is for real!,"This dude is definitely one of the best most political and truthful rappers that have come out that i really do enjoy, forget all the other mainstream crap, i only pump this stuff and all my 90's hip hop, there is no substitute for good rhymes and beats, unfortunately that is hard to find these days."
5,A History Lesson you'll never get from the estabishment,"Tech isn't rapping, he's teaching.Setting a foundation for liberating minds.Things that sound crazy aren't, they're real and you can see for yourself.Many of the lyrics are the keywords to revealing a truth that has been buried. Don't take his word for it, find out for yourself."
5,Without question: One of the best ever.,"This man gives you the strengthening conviction that Hip Hop is not dead. All I could do after hearing the first 9 songs was to kiss the CD case and clinch my fist. This album is so good, I couldn't tell you ""the best cut"" on it. Sticky Fingaz' ""Blacktrash.."" album as well as Akrobatik's ""Balance"" album as well ""Revolutionary Vol. 2"" are three albums that give you a sense of hope about our culture. Only a true Hip Hopper could really appreciate this project. My only advice is that you simply grip it, it's THAT good."
4,Welcome to the Revolution! (2),"I havent even heard all the songs on the cd yet and Im going to tell everyone to buy it! A Breath of fresh air in hip hop. Its been a little while since I could get this excited about a ""new"" group. I wont go into detail about the group because this disc already has plenty of reviews."
3,revolutionary? more like repetitive,"Don't get me wrong, some of these song sre very influential, but would it kill him to change his flow once in a while. Every song has something in common with the rest. The only high points on this album is when IT becomes emotional and filled with passion. Besides these moments, this album is nothing special."
3,Revolutionary homophobe?,"While immortal technique speaks to many issues affecting oppressed people, he fails miserably in recognizing his own part in perpetuating sexism and homophobia.There's nothing revolutionary about calling someone a homothug or calling the woman that aborted a child a b*tch. True revolution recognizes the value of all people.Once again, an underground artist with appeal to activists fails the test."
5,lol,"I just wanted to say I think it's hilarious that reviewer down there who gave the album a 4 thinks the album was produced by Death Row. He thinks the intro is from Suge Knight. Here's what the intro really says: ""You are listening to Revolutionary Volume 2. From Death Row, This is Mumia Abdul-Jamal."""
5,Real HipHop with meaning!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Thank God for cats like Immortal Technique and Non-Phixion who bring it with the real HipHop.5 stars for this album.
5,Death Row?,"Man, I just came by to see what people have been writing 'bout one of the illest MC's out right now and I see this review from some dumb a$$ who apparently didn't even listen to the lyrics. To say that the whole CD was dedicated to dissin' Bu$h is so off it's ridiculous, and what's hillarious is that homie actually thought it was a ""Death Row"" record. People please buy the album and LISTEN to the LYRICS, you might learn sumthin'!!!FREE MUMIA ABU-JAMAL!!!"
3,review from LA,"If I were rating this Cd on beats and flow on the mic, I would give it 5 stars easy. This dude can flow with some of the best and the beats are dope as f&^k. I had to take away two stars though for spittin' poison to the minds of our youth. Keep off the preachin' political B.S. This guys thinks Bin Laden and Bush are like brothers and they blew up the twin towers together. come on bro. But I still bump this cd just to hear the talent and beats. Just a little too much hate and false information that is stated as true facts and a lot of the conspiracies he talks about were already proven untrue long after this cd came out. I love this dude non the less but keepin it real is keepin it real not false. Anyway: music 5 stars, delivery 6 stars, content 3 starts."
4,immortal technique attacks,"immortal technique attacks the mic unlike any other rapper on the underground scene. he rips every track with raw emotion, which, most of the time, is anger and contempt. many rappers (such as virtuoso) use the same anger-battle style, and this technique usually makes for weak rhymes, as these types of emcees concentrate on being mad, rather than on the quality of rhymes. luckily, immortal technique does not have this problem. he is able to masterfully control his raw emotion and create intelligent, poignant rhymes that are enhanced by the power of his voice. it all make for some compelling tracks. technique not only has good flow but also fuses knowledge of politics into his lyrics, which makes listening to this cd an educational experience. revolutionary 2 is a very good underground cd and the only weak part is the beats. at times, they leave something to be desired, but techniques rhyming masks this slight weakness."
5,It will make you wish you could go back in time.,An exquisite soundtrack! It brought me to tears the first time I listened to it as I was reminded of the emotion in the film. I wanted to go back in time for a spell and BE Anna.
5,"So simple, so peaceful and yet so beautiful!","I am writing this while I am listening to the music and I must say this is one of the most wonderful music that I have ever heard in my life.I have seen Anna and the King twice, the first time with my Mom and the second time with my boyfriend. Indeed, when I saw the movie for the 2nd time, I didn't pay much attention to the movie itself, but rather than its music.I have grown up under the strong influence of oriental culture, and I am very impressed by the oriental music which is so perfectly comprehended into the western music. Since I like it so much, I brought not only one for myself, but also another one for my boyfriend. I am sure once you hear, you know every single penny that you spend is worthy."
5,"Wonderfully orchestrated, moving and uplifting","I thought the score was completely wonderful, not a bad thing on the CD. (Except for one song jumps, but that's not really George Fenton's fault, is it?) The songs that especially moving were: The Execution, Anna Returns, ""I Have Danced With A King"" which all have one thing in common, the main theme. It is so beautiful, I get tears in my eyes listening to it, and when its put to film, it makes it twice as more emotional. I didn't think ""How Can I Not Love You?"" was all too bad, considering how terrible I think ""You'll Be In My Heart"" is, it really put good use to how Anna and the King really felt at the end of the movie. It is the best film score I have ever heard, and I recommend it to everyone!"
5,Excellent!,Saw the movie before the soundtrack came out and I couldn't wait to buy it! Loved the movie and I love the soundtrack!
4,i saw the movie and had to have this soundtrack! Very lush!,exotic instrumental music with good melodies make me want to have it playing in the background all day long. It really sets the mood.
4,How Can I Not Love You,Good song in regards to how racism still rules some peoples hearts and minds. How the society controls how people view interacial relationships. I think it is a very good song.
5,What took me so long?!,"I can't believe I waited so long to get this Bucket Boss! Rose gardening is ever so much easier with all my tools in one place, easily transportable from bush to bush. I added the seat to the top, so now my back doesn't bother me so much....and I can stay in the garden longer! There is a convenient-sized pocket for virtually any size tool, and the pockets inside provide great protection for related items that I don't want ""soiled"" while I'm working."
5,"very useful, very handy","very useful, very handy, best deal i could find for one of these, was a good gift for my husband, he uses it alot."
4,Multipurpose!,I bought 2 of the bucket boss organizers for Father's Day gifts. I was very pleased with the quality of the material and space in the pockets: the only problem was the description of the item does not tell you that the 5 gallon bucket is not included....but the gifts were a big hit.....my Father uses it for plumbing tools and Father-in-law uses it on his boat for crabbing/fishing essentials!
2,small pockets,"I love the idea, and still use the product often, but they just seemed to miss on the product. To me the pockets are too small to get tools in and out of easily. I think I would have been much better off buying one with less pockets but more room in each pocket, I would look elsewhere."
2,Misinformed melodrama,"I really regret buying this CD. I barely got through it once. McEvoy's admirable voice and gorgeous contribution to Mary Black's song ""A Woman's Heart"" notwithstanding, this overly ambitious album is trite -- a profound disappointment. Among the chaff here is an insipid and misguided song about a girl with anorexia nervosa (""Sophie says she's really trying/Problem is, Sophie's lying"") as well as the ever-laughable ""She Had It All"" about an alcoholic (""Lipstick smudging her face/Hair all over the place/They say she's a disgrace""). I mean, PLEASE. Great voice, but the girl needs to get someone with writing ability to write her songs! If great lyrics are important to you, stay away."
3,Looking forward to beginning this project.,"Project arrived in a timely fashion. It's a complicated pattern (made a bit more confusing by segmented pages), but I'm looking forward to beginning. Directions are clear."
2,Not for beginners.,"While the author interviews many successful traders from various backgrounds, the most repeated comment was that you get the intuitive response from years of experience. This would appear as commonsense to most.Like riding a bicycle, you at first concentrate on balance. Then after you achieve a comfort level it becomes automatic or intuitive. With so many books on the market, writing a book on the premise that more experience brings on the ability to move by inner feelings is something one needn't pay for."
1,Please save your money!,"Mark Douglas's ""The Disciplined Trader"" is, quite frankly, inexhaustible in explaining the many facets of the psychology of trading, and much better than Koppel's many attempts at the subject."
4,Excellent Update of an Industry Standard,"I got exactly what I wanted--an up-to-date version of a standard to replace the one I have had for years. I particularly appreciated the section on media law--many changes have taken place in the past few years, as the media landscape has changed. Journalists or writers will find knowledge in this area to be especially helpful."
4,Must have for Communications Professionals,This is a handy desktop reference that is a must have for all who write AP style.
4,AP stylebook review,"The only reason I purchased the stylebook was for my journalism class but little did I know how much it would come in handy. I purchased it in ""brand-new condition"" and received it as so except with a small tear on the outside bind of the book. Other than that, it didn't take long and was in good condition."
5,Benefits more than journalists,"The title of this book might lead you to think this is just another grammar book--and one with only print journalists in mind. Not so! If you are looking for a guide that will ensure consistency in all of your corporate literature, I highly recommend this book and its companion ""Bible,"" Webster's New World College Dictionary, Fourth Edition. Never again will you have to wonder whether to add a hyphen, capitalize a word or use an abbreviation. To me one of the main reasons why documents can look unprofessional is because writers don't apply consistency in style throughout corporate literature or even throughout the same piece. This book is the ultimate foundation for consistency, clarity and professionalism. And from here you can add your own ""house styles,"" guidelines that are unique to your profession or business. The return on investment on this book is tremendous."
5,underrated album,"I really enjoy this cd. i got into sunny because i am fan of ayler and cecil taylor, and realized sunny's connection and influence in these seminal groups.this cd is great if you enjoy free jazz. with Roscoe Mitchell, Archie Shepp, Lester Bowie and Alan Silva, its a fantastic lineup.nothing I write could describe the music, just knowing the artists should give you a feel of what to expect. released in 1969, it was at the time when artists really pushed a new form of music.the 1960's were the best for free jazz and this makes an excellent addition to my collection"
1,"Literally, a load of noise","What is it about free jazz? Why do some people see it as artistic freedom and others just utter cacophony? I for one choose the latter. This is just one massive headache, the sound of every saxophone in history being played faster and out of tune in a waterfall factory. Its not something you can come home to, really is it? ""Aaahhh, a hard day at the office. I think I'll unwind with the sheer noise machine that is Sunny Murray."" Errm..... Furthermore, Sunny Murray can hardly be classed as a drummer. A massive wash of deafening cymbals, with no rhythm or pattern, does not a good drummer make. Give me Art Blakey or Max Roach any day of the week!For those that get off with abstract honking and go-nowhere freedom to ""make a statement"", get it by all means. Its just not music! Yes it has notes, but they're in no particular order and not, to coin Eric Morecambes phrase, ""the right notes but in the wrong order."" It is literally a load of noise."
5,Just adorable,Peedie is an adventurous gosling who misplaces his lucky red baseball cap and goes searching for it. The illustrations are just absolutely adorable. My 20-month old son adores this book. Very charming! Makes me want to take a look at related books by the author.
4,cute,Peedie is a small yellow gosling that can be very forgetful. One thing that always remembers though is to wear his favorite red hat. One day he misplaces it. Peedie looks everywhere for his hat. He finds it finally in a very unsual placethe book is small in size making it easy for toddlers to hold and turn the pages. Each page has only one sentence making this easy to read to little ones who have short attention spans. The pictures of various animals will be enjoyed by children of all ages.I would recommend this book to parents and caregivers of children ages birth to 3. The story is very simple and is one that kids will enjoy hearing over and over again.
5,Great baby book,"I have this book as a board book, which is good because it's appropriate as a ""baby's first"" type of book. I just love it and my one year old just loves the bright pictures. When I put it down to get another one, he points to it again. The rhyming text is wonderful and the pictures are really cool and artsy and bright. My 3-year old also likes it because she understands how to find and count the shapes. I really recommend this one - perfect for a baby gift or first birthday!"
5,Changed my life,Pathways to Success: Discover Your Career Potential has helped me find my career path more clearly. It is well organized and well written. As a beginner it was extremely easy for me to use. I recommend this book to anyone that wants more clarity in their life.
5,Absolute Beginner,"I know zip about astrology and can sniff a phony a mile away. I checked out Ms Geffner's book at the urging of a relative who is really into astrology. After a few pages, I got hooked, and found it straight-forward and pretty helpful. I like all the cool names and descriptions, even if I don't still don't understand everything about this art/science. Go out and buy this puppy! it will not disappoint."
5,Really striking and beautiful piece.,"I have received more compliments on this one piece--from *everybody*, even people who don't usually exhibit interest in jewelry or wardrobe--than I have on any other pendant I own. It is large, but the elongated rectangle shape coupled with the airspace inherent in the design helps to make it not appear too large. I am petite and I don't have any problems pulling it off. It's bold, but not aggressive--it has a gentleness, and though it's very contemporary, it has a primitive organic quality. It looks much more expensive than it is, too--a real *piece of jewelry.* And I like the neckwire--the pendant never hangs crazy on me and the clasp stays at the back of my neck where it belongs, and it looks graceful on, even with my short neck."
3,larger than expected,"This is a beautiful necklace, however it was larger than expected. Definately for people who want a bold look."
4,quite enjoyable,"This is nothing new and different. I liked it though. Good performances from some familar faces before they made it big. I'd recomend this for anyone who loved the movie, or is a fan of period peaces and westerns."
5,Snowy River: The McGregor Saga - A Different Breed of Cowboy,I have purchased different vidioes of series and we really enjoy watching all of them. I would recommend them for any age to watch.
2,"If I were you, I would buy (Blueprints in Peds) !","It was my mistake to read from this book, ignoring the good reviews written for (Blueprints in Pediatrics)!! To tell you the truth, I didn't enjoy reading it & I found many chapters poorly written. e.g. - Modern basic genetics - Genetic counselling - Inborn errors of metabolism - Meningitis & encephalitis in infancy and childhood (even Kernig's & Brudzinski's signs are not mentioned!!) - Anemias in childhood.However, there are few excellent chapters (e.g. Part 14: Disorders of the CNS), which are better written than many textbooks. Furthermore, it has many case discussions, and MCQs at the end of each Part."
3,Preparing for medical exam,"I want review all the subject,because this is a new edition and I want to know about the changes."
4,Great barrelhouse piano with band,"Champion Jack, one of my favorite musicians ever (any style or instrument), is here in superb form both at vocals, lyrics and at his unique, unbeatable piano playing. You'll never get tired of listening to this one. The band is OK, but in my opinion this is simply the very best Dupree's recording with European musicians (and he did ""some""). Forget John Mayall and other ""legends""!"
2,Collapse of Garrett's fame!,FULL of factual errors (see Book review in British Medical Journal from late October 2001); way too long; way too repetitive. And completely devoid of ANY constructive suggestions.
2,A well-written book for amateurs,It is a well-written book. It could be interesting for amateures and non-professionals. But I would not recommend the book for professionals working in the areas of infectious diseses and epidemiology. I do not belive it is going to help them understand the problem. It is a good book for frightening youself before going to bed.
4,Good- too US-centric,"Very interesting book, however the last chapter focuses extensively on the US healthcare system, something that wasn't of much interest to me."
4,For Doublebass players,"Nice arrangements, wonderful sound, a wide variety of songs but I wanted to listen more to Gary Karr. The interpretation of Moses Fantasy is better that the one played with the RSO Berlin Orchestra. If you are a DoubleBass player, this is a must. If you aren't, you'll hear what a doublebass can do and how sensitive it could be. I couldn't stop laughing when I heard for the first time the ""sarcastic"" version of Wannabe. This album is like a Raritie. If your're really looking for a serius album to know better the doublebass, this is not the first one that I'll chose. But it's really fun!"
4,I really enjoyed this cd,Being a bass player myself I really enjoyed this cd becuase of the variety of music featured on it! I hope other people can enjoy it and appriciate it as well!
2,"Great prints, teensy-tiny product.","I was terribly disappointed in this book, because it is so tiny, and your eyes have to have 1200 dpi scan to really see everything. Why would an art museum such as the Art Institute of Chicago allow such a one-off throw-away book be published? If you want to see anything, you have to purchase another book. Too bad."
3,Tiny book,"I purchased this book for my brother, thinking that it was regular size. When I visited him I discovered that it was big if you are the size of a gnome."
3,"Nice, but small book","I agree with the other reviews when they say that it is nice, but a very small book. I hadn't paid attention to the size when I ordered it. It is very informative, though, and I did learn a lot from it"
1,Tiny book,What a small book. Who wants little tiny hard to see illustrations. Not me. I should've. Realized for that price something was wrong.
5,Horizon Treadmill,"I found the Horizon T73 to be really great. It has many preprogramed settings to choose from, for your workouts, and also two custom settings for one to make workouts the way you want them. It is very, very, quiet and you can hear a TV with the sound very low. It also has all the features one would want for a treadmill. The company was great to deal with."
5,great treadmill,"It arrived on time, packed in a very well constructed box. Setup and Instructions are easy. It works perfect and is easy to program."
3,"ok, but not what I was expecting","I purchased this book looking for short simple poems to use for weekly poetry time in my first grade classroom. While the poems in this book promote phonemic awareness, they contain big words my first graders can't yet read and they are way too long for a first grader to try to read."
2,I was expecting a poetry book!!,"I was expecting a workbook full of poems, instead there are a handful of poems and the rest are activities and coloring pages about the themes of the poems... which are great, but I wanted more meat... I was expecting poems along the lines of the ""Goose on The Loose"" and Bob Books. I guess I should have read the description more closely!! If I wanted a coloring book and activity book, I could have gotten one for far less than $10...Maybe I am being too harsh, I will surely get some good use out of it as rainy day activties with my kids that will help reinforce some phonics. I guess it just wasn't what I expected."
3,different from anyone else . . .,"Most people are probably not familiar with the band 'Frogpond'...yet after you get the CD u will want to know more about them. Maybe i am a tad biased, seeing how i am from their area (they even thank our local DJ in the thank u's)...but they are awesome. I couldn't give them 5 stars b/c it wasn't the best CD i have ever bought, but it was worth what i paid. I advise everyone to go out and buy it.."
5,its a great follow up!!,Safe Ride Home is a great follow up to thier first album Count To Ten. If your a FrogPond fan then you should own it. And if you ever get the chance to see them live it will blow you away. I love this album and you all will to. Its a must have.
4,This long awaited follow-up will not disappoint you!,"Safe Ride Home is everything you love about Frogpond. Hooks, Grooves, Melody, it's all there and better than ever. Frogpond has come along way from the Kansas plains they formed in, personnel changes, growing pains, business decisions. Their new maturity shines in this Columbia/C2 release. If you're not familiar with Frogpond you better get on the bandwagon soon. It won't be sitting still very long. Don't forget to fasten your seat belts either, when it does take off it's going to be moving pretty fast."
5,My dad Loves them!,"Initially, I bought them as a joke since my dad was turning 50 but he really likes them so much he wears them all the time. When I was searching for some suspenders, I did want to make sure that the ones I did buy for my dad were of good solid quality. Like I said, he loves them!Speedy shipping, great price. Thanks!"
3,suspenders,"The suspenders are wonderful. their the sturdyest I've ever had, but their too small. I'm not sure if I had a choice or not. If I did, it wasn't plain enough for me to see. If anyone orders these, I would recomend them making sure their getting the right size. I am 5 feet 7in, and 140 lbs, and the pair I got are adjusted to the longest setting, and are still a little small."
5,Keep your pants up!,This will do the job nicely and very comfortable and easy to use. The tool belt gets a little heavy at times and this will really help you
3,okay book,I bought this in preparation to become a midwife but after plans changed I didnt need the book anymore. It was a good book and a good read. If you are interested in pregnancy and childbirth.
2,Oooh the early days,Yes the early days when Timo Tolkki was on vocals. Perhaps in a more forgiving time I'd love stuff like the ripping lead cut which psychologically is pretty mature stuff for a young rock band. And lets face it - these guys were just starting out at this point.And that's just it - there isn't much here to tell you that these guys would later write stuff like Black Diamond or Hunting High & Low. And without the signature vox of one Timo Kotipelto it doesn't feel like Stratovarius to a later convert like me. And a poor mix doesn't really help but they probably had to hide the vocals a bit.... sorry Mr Tolkki.
4,Takin' It To The Streets,This would be a fantastic cd rather than a great one if it included Takin' it to the streets. How can a Best of The Doobie Brothers cd be missing that song? Other than that this is a great selection of tracks from the Wildlife Concerts which did include the song. Buy it and play it loud!
3,For the hardcore business user,"A decent attempt at a business-oriented PDA application. More like putting a HP financial/business calculator's functionality into a PalmOS handheld. It has several built-in functions, handy for anyone involved in the savings and loans, mortgages, or leasing fields. If you're involved in any of these fields and have a PalmOS-based handheld, then I would recommend it; otherwise there's really no need for this particular product."
4,Kara's Flowers=Maroon 5,"For those of you who don't know or don't research your music, Kara's Flowers was formed by Adam Levine and his friends back in the 90's. They have blossomed, so to speak, into the best selling band, Maroon 5."
3,Cute!,"I picked this up from the discount rack and it ended up being a very pleasant read. Your standard story about relationships, no real exciting twists for me, but good nonetheless."
2,Graphic SF Reader,"Asterix and Obelix are sitting down telling a bunch of the Gaulish kids about when they were little Asterix and little Obelix, complete with a little wooden Dogmatix.Apparently Obelix was a kid that was picked on all the time and a bit on the sensitive side and not violent at all.Asterix has the idea to nick a bit of magic potion so Obelix can get confident and belt a few of his tormentors up.Getafix coming back early means their plan literally slipped up."
2,WARNING --- this is not a comic book (graphic novel)!,"I'm a big fan of the Asterix series, but I kind of expected this to be a typic Asterix ""comic book"". Instead, it's a text with illustrations! Yes, it's a nice story about when they were all kids, but I like the comic book format! This is more like your typical children's book! I was disappointed with the overall result! Besides, all through the series they mention how Obelix fell into a cauldron of magic potion when he was a baby, and that's how he got his permanent strength. But this book implies he was more like a little boy of 6 or 7 years old --- NOT EXACTLY A BABY! Anyway, I can't recommend this one!"
3,I bought it just to complete of Asterix collection.,"Before purchasing I already knew that this is not a comic book, but more of an illustrated story. So I really did not expect much. I often buy books merely to complete my collection. This is one of those books. But still, if you enjoy the art of Uderzo, you won't be disappointed."
1,Not the exciting adventures we're used to!,"I've been an Asterix fan for about 35 years- the plots and movie versions are so good, but I was disappointed by this rather sketchy effort! Too short and unimaginative in content, this short piece should rather been included in ""Asterix and the Class Act"" for instance, instead of as a publication on its own.DISSAPOINTED!"
5,Appelfeld's Master Work,"Alongside Tzili, The Age of Wonder is Appelfeld's most fully realized novel. Somehow he writes about the impending Holocaust without mentioning Germany or Nazism. The first part of the novel, narrated by an unknown boy, chronicles the slow and steady decline of a Jewish intellectual family. By the time they are sucked into the vortex, there is very little of them left to pluck.In the second half, we meet Bruno, the narrator of the first part. It is years after the Holocaust and he lives in Jerusalem. He returnes to his home town, and in a series of very evocative encounters, finds that nearly everything of that former world is gone, and what is left is only a sad and shallow reminder of loss.The Age of Wonder is Appelfeld's most successful novel; it is both bold and restrained at once, a taut testimony of a family's decline and the death of a people."
5,"Excellent readibility and examples, did well in class","I purchased this book for a class where it was required, but saved $ by purchasing through amazon. I paid about $120 and see that the price has gone up in the last 2 months. This book seems long but is filled with examples of calculations and process. I found that reading the book gave me a clearer and more thorough explanation than even my teacher could give. I have learned a lot and would highly recommend this book to anyone trying to learn finance."
1,Fundamentals of Corporate Finance Standard Edition + S&P Card + Student CD,"I cannot give you a review both items were returned do to a mishap on my professor's end. The item was returned about three weeks ago and I have not received a return as of to date.. Truthfully, I'm unhappy with your service and will tell other individuals not to purchase items from your company :( Still awaiting refund."
3,finance,"i only looked at the book once because the professor didnt require us to use the book for studying purposes. im sure it's a useful book, i just didnt get to use it."
3,Not very good book about rapunzel,"I didnt particularly enjoy this book. It is pretty much a rendition of rapunzel and it is told in 3 different perspectives. Count Konrad, Zel and her mother. Zel ""Rapunzel"" was named after the lettuce that her ""real"" mom love to eat while she was carrying her. The book tells about Zel meeting Count Konrad. After she tells her step mom about Zel, she locks her in a tower. Count Konrad spends years trying to find her. There is a rather graphic sex scene in this book so I would advise no one under 13 to read this book. It was okay. And it was just that okay....The ending was not very good and you don't get an idea about what happens. This book could have been way more better."
5,Exuberant,"This book facisnated me! It is a great book for people who love Fantasy&Science Fiction! This book has a very interesting plot with just a hint of suprise, you will have to read it to find out more!~BookLuVa67"
2,"it was good, but confusing at times","i was eager to start this book. the details made the setting very vivid, and i liked that. however, sometimes it was confusing to understand what was occuring. it basically centered around the fairy tale, but the fact each chapter was written by a different character (zel, konrad, mother) really added something. i plan to read more of the author's words as well."
2,Not Very Promising,"Zel started out as a good book that I couldn't put down. The story is about an almost 13 year old girl who meets a handsome count named Konrad. Zel's mother is afriad that Zel will chose to live without her and imprsions Zel in a tower, the reasons for this are a little unclear. As the story goes you learn that Zel's mother sold her soul to the devil in order get her daughter. It was hard to understand the Zel parts of the book when Zel was in the tower and some parts of the book were TOTALLY inappropriate. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
3,Warning,"Do not give this to your daughter as I was about to do, unless you want to encourage premarital sex. I was very disapointed that a potentially good story had to be ruined with values I so strongly disagree with."
3,"Good, but not great","I have just finished reading this book, and I must say that the story was not as satisfying as the previous book read over the summer by Napoli, The Smile, which was based around the story behind Mona Lisa's smile. Unlike The Smile, Zel was much darker, something that probed the depths of human ""love"", both the dark and light aspects of it. Honestly, I was looking for a light summer read from Napoli because of my love for the previous book, although I should not have expected that from the book flap... The beginning really grabbed and intrigued me, as it was really sweet and light, but as the book progressed, Napoli served us something rather dark. Even after finishing the happy ending, I still felt that this book lacked that little ""oomph"" factor which makes books a thrill to read and truly savor."
5,Perhaps my favorite book ever!,"I love this book. Zel is Donna Jo Napoli's best book, in my opinion. It is a retelling of the fairy tale Rapunzel, but it is much better. Rapunzel had always been one of my less favorite fairy tales, until I read this book. Donna Jo Napoli creates a vivid story about a mother's love and how far she will go to keep her daughter near her. This book is full of sacrifice, romance, and sadness. Napoli was genius when she wrote showing Zel's mother's point of view, which makes your heart ache for her, while normally ""the evil witch"" who locks Rapunzel in the tower is to be hated. Napoli also did a WONDERFUL job at depicting the gradual decline of Zel's state of mind while in the tower. Some bits are even a bit gruesome. Buy this book (it is not expensive), and you will be very happy you did because you will read it many times (I have!). After reading this book, I was very pleased because it let me have a good cry, and it left me a good feeling."
5,An Excellent Book,Zel is great book! Donna Jo Napoli pulls off a successful retelling of Repunzel. This book matains the classic fairy tale but has modern realism to it.
4,great book!,"this was a good book, and it gave me a different poitn of view on the old fairy tale. it's cool, because at first you don't know what story it is unitl later on. it's a little wierd, because zel goes a little crazy in her confinment in the tower and begins talking to animals and stuff. there is some evil in this book, too, so i would recommend it to no younger than 11 or 12."
5,A dazzeling book for mothers & thier daughters,A dazzeling tale that will leave you spellbound.I recamend for anyone.It touched me with it's devotian.I am 10 so I think this is for people ages 9-90 or higher. It is a truley touching story. Read it now for splender & amazement this summer.
3,Not for young readers...,I have to say the story was good but some parts a little too much for young readers. The parts of her mother selling her soul to the devil should be erased completely! and (i hate to sound dowdy) when the prince finally climbs up to her and ...well she gets pregnant. To many graphic details that were inappropiate for I'd say under 6th grade.
3,Zel,"This book was another version of Rupunzel and it did not impress me. I didn't like how her mother lied to her when she put her in the tower and told Zel that someone was tryng to kill her. And when Zel was in the tower she basically went crazy! I wouldn't really recommend this book to anyone, and hardly got throught it myself!"
5,Review,"Firstly, I want to ask why people seem to make such a huge deal about Zel sleeping with the prince. They exchange marriage vows, and nothing is actually said. It was implied, and the only part the story tells is when Konrad wakes up, the next morning. From the way people seem to carry on, you would think it was graphically detailed. I didn't even realize they'd slept together until I skipped back and put two and two together.While I still wouldn't recommend this book to anyone under twelve, that's only because of the descriptions of Zel's madness in the tower. It was very disturbing, and I cried when I read it. People younger than me might have found it more traumatic, but I think teenagers and preteens could handle it, because it makes the story more emotional and realistic. Overall, it was a great book, disturbing and very romantic toward the end."
5,MUST-HAVE Accessories and a Good value,"This kit complemented my new DC4800 camera perfectly. Most of the accessory items I wanted came together in this one kit: extra battery, international battery charger, PREMIUM camera bag, and lens pen. (A sample pack of inkjet photo paper is included.)The charger is great because I can use it outside of the USA since it is compatible with power in most foreign countries. However, you will still need a plug adapter outside of North America. Perhaps the greatest of all is that a completely drained battery is COMPLETELY recharged in one hour or less with this charger. The DC4800 camera itself can recharge batteries; but it takes up to 4 hours and the camera cannot be used during that time.The Lens Pen helps keep your camera and lenses free of smudges and fingerprints; and the nice padded bag will help protect your camera and accessories. This kit is cheaper than buying the items separately. ( Kodak item# 1174770 )"
1,Don't buy this,"The camera case is worthless - it doesn't seal at all so pieces can easily fall out and dust can go in.Of course, the battery and charger are very useful, so simply buy the charger individually and then purchase a REAL camera case and a lens cleaner. You won't miss those 5 pieces of paper."
4,Great charger. Bag is nice but could be improved a bit,"A great deal overall. The charger is super and the spare battery is a necessity.The bag is big enough for the camera, instruction manual, spare battery and USB cable, but the fit is a bit awkward. I would have preferred a snug, molded fit for the camera and a bit more room for the manual. As it is, I had to insert the manual diagonally in an oddly sized pocket, wasting some space."
5,Great Speakers,"I purchased the Alpine SPR-69C to replace my stock Clarion speakers in my Nissan Altima. I have them hooked up to an aftermarket Kenwood unit and overall the speakers sounded good, but not great. They had good mid's and highs, and you can position the tweeter to the preferred position to maximize the sound in your car. Highs were good, but the bass was minimal at best. Given that these are Alpine, Type R speakers, I figured I did not have enough power pushing them to get the true sound and performance that the speakers are made for. I then hooked them up to my 4 Channel Kicker Amp, and the sound was night and day difference. The bass was deep, sounds almost like mini subs, the mids and highs are out of this world. If you buy these, hook them up to amp and you will not regret it all. You will hear sounds in a song that you have never heard before. Great speakers and I would recommend anyone to buy them if they will hooked up to an amp."
5,Best 6x9 full-range speaker available?,"Installed these in the front of my Nissan Frontier KingCab, with Alpine SPS-600 6.5"" in the rear. These complement those speakers very, very well. Highs and mids are sharp and clear, yet will thump and rattle the mirrors with only 20-watt RMS power. For the type of music I listen to -- classic rock and country -- I don't need subs nor even an amp -- these speakers are VERY efficient for something that will handle 100W continuous...Alpines simply provide the best sound reproduction over the full spectrum -- and in this price range they simply blow away the rest..."
5,Great Speakers,"With these the mid level frequencies dont have as much as a noticable differance than last years version, but the highs deffinatly. Alpine completely redesigned the tweeter so highs are much louder than before and over all they have a great SQ."
3,Excellent bridge between Welcome 2 Detroit and Champion Sound,"Dope, not his best work though. A lot of the Stones Throw/bandwagon Dilla fans say it's this AMAZING classic gem. It's dope... but not that dope. The one really cool thing that this EP does is bridge Welcome 2 Detroit to Champion Sound. It really helps put the dots together as in his progress and movement with his production style.Although in my opinion this release isn't his best work, I highly suggest checking it out. It's some dope ish you can just pop in the jeep and ride to. (in the same vein as Sittin' On Chrome)Choice cutsMake 'EM NVThe $Chrushin""Nothing Like This (which was also released on Chrome Children)3/5"
5,bump this in your headphones or while you're cruisin,Just copped this cd and I have to say its bangin. The beats are real hard and the album has a real nice flow to it. I cant think of one track that i skip over. I really liked donuts and welcome 2 detroit and this is simply another great dilla album. I am feeling his flow on this too-some people aren't and thats cool. And if you happen to just want to bump the raw beats your in luck my friend cuz stones throw got you covered with that instrumental cd included too. Bravo. Isn't it refreshing when you buy an album and you just love the whole thing? Not an eveyday thing.
4,Dilla Always!,"I got the album about 3 months ago. Honestly my first impression was not good but the album steadily grew on me. Dilla continuosly changes his style as a producer and keeps me guessing. His latest style is much different from his Slum Village days but I still like the vintage era sounds creates. Ruff Draft is a good album nontheless.I found this great companion piece!J. Dilla (Limited Edition) 18"" X 24"" Inch Poster"
4,gooodness 2 the max,"R.I.P. JDthe whole cd was pretty bombmy favorites tracks on it were ""nothing like this"", ""crushinn YEAAA"", ""wild"", and ""take notice""this cd is a classic...definitely cop this album"
4,Dilla is that dude,"Being from Detroit I would support anything that Dilla does. My favorite track is ""The $"", that track shows J can spit better than most of the cats out right now. Not his greatest work but better than most bull ish out right now. Thank GOD for Dilla, RIP dawg!!!"
4,She Has Done Better,"""Boy (I Need You)"" will never be regarded as a Mariah classic along the lines of ""Dreamlover"" or ""Always Be My Baby"", but it's a decent song. Mariah's vocals aren't particuarly strong, but they don't have to be for this sugary little pop song. Everyone complains that she doesn't use her full voice anymore. Well, FYI: it would be ridiculous if she used her ""Vision of Love"" voice on this mindless little ditty!"
2,very average,Mariah Carey use to do songs like these as Album Filler but nowadays with not much to select from Mariah is stuck with having to Cover tracks on the spot&still trying to sound hip&happening.this song is boring aside from Mariah's vocals.but even Her voice can't save this song.Her version nor Cam'ron's does much for me.give me the Original Rose Royce Version any day.
3,Doen't fit to DCR-PC55,"This battery, NP-FA70, is not compatible with Sony DCR-PC55 camcorder. It doesn't fit into the camcorder. The battery DCR-PC55 uses is the NP-FA50 which is thinner and has lower capacity.Another NP-FA70 equivalent battery (identical to this one but more expensive) sold on Amazon confused me, because it states that NP-FA70 is compatible with DCR-55, which is not correct. (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A6XAT2/ref=pd_cmp_rvi_2_a/104-6220992-2388731?n=502394)This battery is thicker than NP-FA50 and does not fit into DCR-55's battery bay."
4,Who loves you?,"Moonpie and Ivy by Barbara O'Connor is realistically sad. The main character Pearl is left with her Aunt, whom she hardly knows, when her mother, Ruby, abandons her. Pearl and her Aunt Ivy consider Ruby's action as selfish.While Pearl questions who loves her, how to love others, what love is, and how to be loved; she sees how Moonpie, an ugly neighbor boy, is loved by seemingly everyone. Hoping not to reveal the ending, many of Pearls questions are answered in this heart-wrenching realistic tale.Sadly, children all over the United States are left with these same questions, when they are abandoned by their parents."
2,Sweet But Unsatisfying,"Gordon makes gooey pop in the tradition of Jellyfish or Loud Sugar. Fairly innocuous fluff, but grating if listened to repeatedly."
2,wrong year,"I ordered the portfolio for my brother as a gift in the year of 2002 and the calendar inside was for the year 2000. He loves the gift, but I have no idea where to get a calendar for him for the right year. Something I should not have to worry about when making a purchase."
2,"Great idea, poor execution.","I really wanted this little organizer to work and for a few weeks it did... after a few weeks though the plastic stiffiner inside the fabric cover shattered. Floppy and filled with broken plastic between the layers of fabric, it was useless to me. I think the cause may have been the cold weather in Colorado but contractors work outside... should be durable enough to stand up."
1,No Bueno!,"Bought this portfolio for the lower price and larger size. Photos make item appear to be made of quality materials and rugged construction,like the Orvis Battenkill portfolios which are no longer available.It's not by a long shot. Only lasted 6 months before coming apart at the seams. Only carried it to and from work once every two weeks. What a piece of trash!"
2,Contractor's Portfolio Review,"The enlargement pictures of the portfolio are great, but no where does it state the size or what is included. Does it come equipped with paper, etc? What size and where can paper, indexes, etc. be purchased. More information would be helpful in making a purchase decision."
3,Very light cream,"Not sure if this is one of those creams where 'a little goes a long way'. It is very light, which is nice but it is unclear if it's helping my eyes at all."
2,Kenroy Home 30742ORB,I like the style. The packaging was terrible. The packing material disentegrated all over my floor. It arrived damaged. The neck was bent in several places and it took my son and I about three hours to straighten it and put it together. I wanted to send it back but my son insisted on fixing it. I would not recommend to anyone.
4,Stylistically Perfect,"I own the six-light chandelier, the pendants, and the ceiling lights from this family of lighting, and this lamp matches the modern craftsman style of our house perfectly. I agree with other reviews that I read that the floor and table lights do not always appear perfectly straight or square, but all in all, they are great. It takes some careful inspecting to notice un-square or un-straight flaws."
2,Disappointed,"Like others - I was surprised that the shade was rectangular, expected round, but I like it. I had to return the first lamp b/c it was defective -the holes in the base werent large enough for the center rods to fit through. The second lamp's workmanship wasnt as nice as the first - there were cracks and defects that seemed to be repaired shoddily at the factory, I guess. The packing styrofoam makes a MESS! Lastly, I too expected the bottom panel/insert to be a different color from the top one which it appeared to be in the picture -the reality isnt as interesting. Buy something else. Side note: Amazon's return process was easy and painless!"
3,floor lamp,"This lamp is beautiful and emits a warming yellow light, however, the base is small and it is very unstable. I'd recommend it be place in a corner or at the very least against a wall. Mine has fallen over once, and while nothing broke, the top part under the shade bent significantly."
1,do not buy,"this item came broken also with missing peaces, and i'm not able to return the product because i live in jamaica, DO NOT BUY"
5,Good but watch the price,"These work well, and are cheap. However, watch the price here. Individual sellers instead of amazon are selling one at a time (instead of a set of two) for more than a complete set should cost. If you are seeing more than 4.00 for A SET OR TWO, you are being ripped off. One business is selling them for 3.00 a piece + 2.00 shipping (5.00 for half the set! - TOTAL RIP). Amazon might eventually sell these themselves and offer a reasonable price, until then, watch these sellers. You can pick these things up almost anywhere, it is worth looking elsewhere at these prices."
2,"Interesting subject, badly written book","This book has all the flaws of a poorly written biography - unsubstantiated claims to understanding characters' thoughts and motivations, lots of irrelevant details, broad generalizations, inferences treated as facts, and amateur-psychologist diagnoses. Perhaps with serious editing, this could be a decent book. As it is, learning about the people and the times keeps me going, though my annoyance at the author's careless approach to a serious story makes me want to stop. I am not surprised Kathy Boudin did not cooperate."
4,entertaining 60s social history,"This story of a leftist/progressive family and their radical daughter is a microcosm of the intertwining social and political trends that helped shape the 60s. Nice insights into family dynamics and generational friction, the search for ""authenticity"" (black panthers, bomb-making) by white, middle class kids, and a glimpse of what life was like among the radical fringe. For a West Coast take on the same period, look at Peter Coyote's ""Sleeping Where I fall."" Both explore the confluence of the personal and the political in a volatile era."
1,Pooly Written & Poorly Researched,It's a shame such an interesting and important story should be so awkwardly written and so badly researched. I'm waiting for another author to carefully write the book that this period of time in our history deserves. There are so many inaccuracies in time and place that one cannot trust the writer.
3,One piece only...,"Keep in mind this is $10 for one piece...it sounds great, but this is just one single piece of work."
5,Great DVD!!!,"In present day every more or less talented child has recording of almost each minute of his life. Unfortunately there is not much left from the great time of truly God`s Fiddler, therefore materials from this movie are absolutely priceless! This DVD is great gift for all musicians who respect and deeply feel unique art of the GREATEST VIOLINIST -Jascha Heifetz!!!"
3,My teenage boys like it because of the thrill of the icy roads.,We discovered this show through my teenage boy. I think it is probably geared towards that age group and gender.
1,Ice Road Truckers,"Wanted to cancel this order, but they still shipped it. Horrible service. Never use them again. Can find better one."
2,Soft but too thin,"This pillow was wonderfully soft, but was way too thin for a back or side sleeper."
2,Very Thin and not very comfortable,This pillow was diappointing. It was too thin and did not provide much comfort. I did not end up using it.
3,Just okay,"I was not really impressed with these pillows after reading the reviews. I would only recommend purchasing them if you like a soft pillow. They flatten out quite a bit after you lay your head on them. I will say that the quality is very good though, and we have never had problems with feathers sticking into our heads."
4,Fatboy Slim meets Henry Rollins,"Techno brits fuse techno with spoken word and arrive at an album that really works. ""Battleflag,"" is the catchiest, musically, but I also enjoyed the rest of the album. Lost of ""prose"" meshed with techno. Great if you are a fan of Fatboy Slim, Chemical Bros., or Underworld."
5,A must-have for DC4800 owners,"If you have the Kodak DC4800 camera, an extra battery is a must-have addition to your equipment, especially if you take this camera away from convenient accessible electicity. I love the camera, but it is a major battery hog, like most digital cameras with an LCD.Having an extra battery is ABSOLUTELY essential, but I also recommend getting this kit for the charger, which will charge the DC4800 battery 3 times faster than the camera's built-in charger. Plus, you can actually USE the camera with one battery while the other is charging. The camera's built in cahrger does not allow you to use the AC adapter to take photographs and charge a battery simultaneously, so without an external charger you are guaranteed some down time.With this camera, it is a MUST to have an extra battery, but this kit (battery and charger) well worth it simply for the convenience."
2,Flimsy,"This charger is speedy and compact -- necessities for effective picture-taking.But the plug (which pivots out from the unit to plug into a wall) is flimsy. After only five months of occasional use, the pivot came loose and now the plug doesn't carry power into the charger. So I can waste time getting warranty service, or I can spend $80 for a new charger."
2,Poor reliability,This item broke after 6 months. This is a very handy item to have especially since you can charge batteries while you are using the camera. You have to be very careful plugging and unplugging into the ac outlet or the unit breaks easily.
2,Not worth it,"I bought this for this small price and got what I paid for. It worked good for about 6 months, then just stopped. The power light comes on, but it doesn't recognize my cards anymore. Cheaply made, in China, what else would you expect?"
1,Piece of junk do not buy it,"Mini All-in-1 Memory Card Reader Black Compatible with: Secure Digital: miniSD (with adapter), microSD/TransFlash (with adapter), Compact Flash: CF I, CF II, CF Ultra II, MicroDrive, xD Picture Cards, Memory Stick: Memory Stick, Memory Stick Pro, Memory SI just bought last week. It did not work. It not worth even taking risk of pay $5 for shipping. I do not recommend buy this. Do not buy it waste of money"
1,It works as designed - NOT!,"Simple review - this thing sucks!I guess someone bought this in bulk from China and now trying to get rid of it through amazon. Maybe this was $10/100 pieces wholesale.As for why it sucks. Plug it in - get's recognized, then after a few seconds it disappears. It disappears whether it's gathering dust or you're trying to get data from a memory card. My guess the chip overheats or some timing issue or bug in the firmware."
1,Garbage from China,"Don't waste your money or your time on this quirky poorly designed product. If you are expecting any support or descent drivers, forget it."
1,Worked for a few days,"Worked fine for a few days, then the reader shows ""unknown device"" and ""malfunction"" when connected. Junk."
2,Does not work with Vista,"Vista will put in the drivers for the device, but soon as you try to put in the memory chip it freezes up - over and over again. I tried looking for solutions on the internet and tried some Microsoft fix solutions for SD memory, but I could not get it to work with this product. However, it worked great on a Win2000 machine, and - no putting Vista in compatibility mode for Win2000 on this device did not work either."
4,Superb story,"This series has one of the most engaging plots of any book or series I have ever read. The plot was fast paced, making an easy, but interesting and fun series to read. I highly recommend it."
5,READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!,"I read these books and immediatly put them at the top of my top ten list. Garion is an orphan, peacefully growing up on a farm in the care of his Aunt Pol, when one day she takes him away on a quest that he knows nothing about, with people he's never met, to places he's never heard of, to be part of a seven thousand year old prophecy. I won't spoil it all, so I'll just say this is one of the best books ever written"
4,Young man discovers his destiny to save the world from evil.,"In David Edding's Belgariad, we follow the life and adventures of Garion, a young farmboy that discovers that he has been chosen by prophecy to rid the world of the evil god Torak. Along with his very distant ancestors (Belgarath and Polgara), and several close friends that he meets along the way, young Garion travels half the world on a quest to kill a god. As the ""Child of Light"", Garion discovers many remarkable things about his family and himself, as well as about life, love and responsiblility. The Belgariad is an artful fantasy that will capture your heart, mind and imagination"
3,The BEST Fantasy Series I Have EVER Read!,"I am from Singapore, and I'm 11 years old. Some scenes in these books may be considered too ""graphic"" for my age, and I started reading this series when I was 9 years old! Yes, but I was hooked on it ever since. I felt like crying when I couldn't find anymore of his books to read because the library had revamped itself and a lot of the old books had been thrown out. But I saved up and bought the two novels, Polgara the Soceress and the one about Belgarath. READ! Good buy..."
3,not sure,"it is a lot bigger than I thought it would be. My daughter liked it but hasn't used it yet due to its large size. It has lots of room for the mutes, well cushioned area for the trumpet and room for music. But if you need to carry this around all day with a lot of other stuff such as a backpack full of schoolwork, it is large and not as convenient to use as a smaller gig bag."
4,protec trumpet case,I bought this so I would not have to carry an extra bag with mutes.As other people have have commented it is very large. Larger than I expected. Will continue to try it. Very well constructed. It holds all the equipment needed along with music in the side pocket.
3,"A great case, in theory...","It really is a great case. It's got a hard shell with a padded canvas cover, so lots of protection and still pleasant to carry and looks great. I bought it because I wanted the room inside to carry mutes and other gear.The reason I say ""in theory"" is the cover has ripped at the seam and the inner wooden shell is exposed at one corner. I've only had my case for a year and I'm not particularly rough with it. It should do better than this. It's also a little heavy - not a big deal if you're only carrying the instrument, but a huge deal if you have it, plus a backpack, plus other gear. I found myself wishing for my gig bag again."
2,"Lots of information, bad editing, bad story telling.","This book, has lots of information. It's useful. However, it's a terrible read and by far the worst history book I've ever read. I highly recommend that people interested in the history of brazil choose another book on the subject. The editing is sooo bad that entire paragraphs are hard to make sense of. The book does not flow well at all. It's terribly slow and almost uncomprehensive. I'm about done with the book now.. but I'm reading the damn book at about 10 pages an hour because it's such a bore.Choose something else.2 Stars for trying."
1,Possibly the worst film I've ever seen...,I have seen a lot of very bad low-budget horror movies before but this might be the worst. From the horrible inconsistencies to terrible props and acting it's hard to know where to begin. I guess all I can say is that if you even have any desire what-so-ever to see this film suppress it. It's not worth the hour and ten minutes of your life. I can only hope that the makers of this film decide to call it quits. There isn't one thing in this movie that shows that they have any promise for the future.
2,Strange...,"I was hoping for a story (my baby is named Zoe) but instead it is another standard Alphabet book only featuring children with names that try way too hard to be diverse. Maybe my baby will grow into the illustrations, but right now she is confused by them."
4,AN ARTIST TO KEEP YOUR EYE ON....,"Although this album leans heavy on Contemporary Gospel, but has several tracks that could have easily graced Billboard's Dance Charts such as: ""Can't Stop Praisin' His Name"" & ""Shelter"". Even includes tracks that could easily went Top 20 on Billboard's R&B Charts like: ""He'll Make You Wanna"" & ""Happy"", So was it fault of the company? Bad Timing? Or someone simply didn't know how to Market/Promote it because of the strong Gospel Overtones?. Whatever the reason(s) may have been this Compact Disc should be a most welcome piece to add to your collection. Expect Bigger & Better things from Ann Nesby......Believe me, it's just a matter of time."
4,definite diva gospel sound,"I love Annes voice on every track, and I like most of the production. The last track, ""Make me better"" is a really nice bouncing hip hop piece with great guitar melodies. I wish more of her songs were like this, but still well worth a spin."
4,Tim Wendel captures the flavor of Havana,"Castro's Curveball provides fascinating insight into a city that few Americans have visited, Havana. Tim Wendel skillfully weaves a compelling story about an aging baseball player's romance with a fearless female photographer in Havana during the rise to power of Fidel Castro in the early 1950's. While the book captures Castro's single-minded ambition to change Cuba's political future, it does so without becoming bogged down by the details of a complex and volatile political revolution. Rather, the author focuses on the romance between the two main characters, and the romance of Havana. His detailed descriptions of the sights, sounds and smells of a beautiful but troubled city makes you feel as if you were there. Well worth reading even if you are not a baseball fan."
4,Baseball in Cuba in the 1950's,"If you enjoy baseball, history, and like good writing, you will enjoy reading Castro's Curveball. It is set in Cuba during the 1950's, tells the story of a U.S. ballplayer who plays winter ball in Cuba and meets a young Cuban, Fidel Castro, who is a would-be pitcher. It is a well written and intersting story about baseball, about the players, about the Cuban people, and about Cuba in the 1950s."
5,Hits it out of the Park!,"I found Castros' Curveball a wonderful ride through an amazing journey. Whether you are a history buff, a romantic, a sports fan or just an avid reader, there is a strong enough story to keep those pages turning. Tim Wendell should be comended for bringing these characters to life. I found myself wordering throughout the book -- is this fact or fiction?I HIGHLY recommend it. An excellent Bookclub selection!"
1,Cartoon characters in a non-existent place called Cuba.,"Intrigued by the plot synopsis, I purchased this book with high expectations. After reading it I felt cheated of both time and money. The real-life Fidel may be a ruthless dictator or a heroic leader; in either case though, he is a charismatic figure who transcends time and enemies. The author's Fidel is a one-dimensional, cliche-speaking, cartoon like character. Worse can be said of the other two protagonists, ball-player Billy Bryan and the love of his life photographer Malena Fonseca. Nothing in this novel seems right. In real life people don't talk or act in the simplistic way the author presents them. Descriptions have no depth. No real sense of time or place develops. Halfway through the plot loses direction. In sum I intensely disliked this book and don't recommend it."
3,Wanted: More please,"It was nice soothing novel by Tim Wendell but, it needs more... Not another book with the same plot, just more events for all the HYPE."
5,nice summer read,"Nice book to read at the beach. I liked the love story, it was unexpected in what I thought would be purely a baseball book."
5,Castro's Curveball,"I found this book to be very enjoyable. It cleverly tied together historical fiction, baseball, and a love story. It was easy to read, and kept my attention. I would highly recommend it."
5,Refreshingly Honest and Encouraging,"If you are looking for a great gift for yourself, or someone else, I suggest the new book, ""Romancing the Buddha - Applying Buddhism to Everyday Life"", by Michael Lisagor. I just finished reading it and it was so refreshingly honest and encouraging. I am so glad that I read it."
4,Design changed,"The toolroll is slightly different than the photo. The socket clip is replaced with 3 baggy edge pockets that are velco-sealed via a single long flap... a nice feature. The outer tie strings are replaced with web straps secured via plastic friction buckles. You must feed each strap through its buckle, then back, and pull it snug... it's a little cumbersome. The main area has 22 pockets."
1,VERY poorly made.,The interior lining started to tear and crack almost immediately. Better to keep it all canvas than this rubbish. Shame on you Bucket Boss!
2,Very poor workmanship and Quality Control,"I just ordered three Bucketboss Toolroll Classics (Item #07004REV2) and found all three with threads hanging out and two of the three with the stitching coming undone. The pockets on the items with the stitching coming undone are useless as the internal pockets are now non-existent and the loops have come off. All 3 products exhibit very poor workmanship and QC. I contacted Bucketboss directly and a lady there was very nice to refer me to Amazon. I can't seem to find a number where I can speak to someone at Amazon and express my dissatisfaction with this item, therefore I'm doing it here. I chose this item because I have another from a few years ago which I still like very much and was soundly made. Sadly, the new three were not."
3,It's an OKAY tool roll,The tool roll has space for a lot of tools....the only reason I gave it three stars was because the straps to open and close it are not convenient.
4,Good Value.,"Although I have not had a chance to use this product yet, it appears to be priced about right for the quality of the product. I rate it as a good value."
4,Very Good Product,"I got this item to store a slightly expanded beyond the basics tool kit behind the seat of my Ford Ranger truck. Space is limited there and every thing else I looked at was either too big and bulky or it did not have enough individual pockets to do the job. The tool roll seems to be constructed pretty well. I have about 20 pounds of tools rolled up in it and it holds together nicely when moved around or carried. I figured out additional larger tools such as a claw hammer and pipe wrench can be carried in it as well by laying them lengthwise with the roll when rolled up and securing them with the straps on the exterior. Storage for sockets, both short and deep well, could be better so I gave this item 4 stars rather than 5 stars for the short-coming. Overall, a very good product."
4,Gets the job done,"It's just what I wanted. I can put my metric wrenches on one side and my SAE wrenches on the other, and it still leaves room for some screw drivers. It's simple and gets the job done."
2,Well made but unrealistic,"Can't argue with the quality construction, but not very practical once you load it with tools. A slightly smaller profile that was meant to hold half as many tools would be handier. And offering in two colors would allow you to grab the roll you needed. And frankly I'm not fond of the buckles either. For tool rolls as with tools -- simpler is better. I wish I hadn't bought it."
3,tool roll,"I BOUGHT THIS FOR WORK TO HELP KEEP MY MISC. TOOLS TOGETHER, IT'S STURDY BUT THE POCKETS ARE A LITTLE SMALL, BUT OTHER THAN THAT I WOULD BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN."
4,WORKS GOOD,WORKS GOOD IS WELL MADE AND HOLDS ALOT OF TOOLS. ALSO BOUGHT ARSENAL BRAND ROLL-UP AND BUCKET BOSS BRAND IS MUCH NICER.
4,Patrol Box Utensils for Scout Troop,We use these to keep our troops patrol box cooking utensils organized and together. Works great for that use. Sort of a different use but clearly works well for that.
4,Its pretty good,"Bought this tool roll to carry some loose camping equipment on longer trips. It fits my tent stakes, pop flares, 550 cord, tin snips, cable binders, knife sharpener, knife/fork/spoon, etc. that often get lost due to lack of proper organizational pockets in larger rucksacks It also fits matches, wire, methanol fuel, etc. in the 3 pouches. Material is pretty decent and has a plastic coating on the inside, making it easy to clean. The cinch-up straps use a cam buckle, which holds it really tight, but can be cumbersome when opening and closing it often. If space is tight in my ruck, I can attach it to the outside MOLLE webbing using the straps. The handle is tough and durable, and the elastic strap down the middle of the inside keeps items from falling out Overall, I haven't found a better tool roll in this price range, and I just ordered another to use as a tool roll for my truck."
3,Essential to One's Crime Library,"Worth viewing if only for the fact that this is the only videotape which factually documents the criminal career of Vincent ""Mad Dog"" Coll. Included are interviews with T.J. English, best known as author of ""The Westies,"" New York Daily News reporter Michael Daly, and several other authoritative sources. This video also contains rare newspaper footage and photos, among which what I assume to be a mug shot of Coll taken shortly after his arrest for the Harlem baby murder, in which he is still donning the mustache and eyeglasses he wore to avoid detection by the police while ""on the lam."""
3,"Really Cute ""Christian""","This was a fun movie to catch a glimpse of. My favorite kind of Christian movie, namely ones with really cute guys are in it. And believe me, mostly that is mostly NOT what is being offered, as severe moralizing rarely goes together with cute, it seems! Anyways, Jay Roberts Jr, who apparently appears in ""Christian"" and vampire movies as well, is here showing that cute and cool can be religious hip. He is sooooooo cute. He finds Jesus while skiing. Apparently being around people rich enough to ski is a crucible that brings on religious conviction for such cuties, with the help of moralizing friends. He actually takes time out from the slopes the query about the bible, with terrific hair. How cute!"
3,Decent cases for the money,"For my use, these cases work well. Most of my CD's/DVD's end up on a shelf and are not subject to a harsh environment. If you need durable cases, I would look away from cheap slim lines and more towards ""mailer"" quality cases."
3,The Little Things,"Even this review will be little. Only a few pages within the book, I was dismayed to see that the editors, proofers (and author) apparently did not understand the difference between it's and its. While this might be laughed off as a delicious irony in a contemporary book on consciousness, my sense of cosmic humor was on the low side, and before proceeding any further, returned the book. Since I didn't read the entire book, I can only be fair and rate it somewhere in the middle."
5,Five Stars are Not Enough!,"This is the legendary 1937 HMV Beethoven Fifth with the Berlin Philharmonic. While there are a number of truly great recordings of this work - Klemperer, Kleiber, Solti, Weingartner, Nikisch - this one tops them all for sheer drive and passion. Likewise, the ""Coriolan"" Overture will terrify its listener with it shattering climaxes, and the ""Egmont"" Overture likewise will carry the listener along with its tempestuous course. The transfers are exceptionally lifelike. In a pinch, I still consider Furtwaengler to have been the greatest performing musician of my experience."
4,bigger than expected,"I ordered this hopping ball because we already have a green gymnic with a 55 listed on the ball that we found at a local store 2 years ago. My daughter loves her ball and my son is finally big enough for his own. I bought a spongebob one from Target and it died within a couple months. My daughter has bounced on hers for a full two years and it is still going strong! I ordered another 55 in red assuming it would be the same size, but it was actually much larger. I don't know what happened over the past 2 years because 55 is a size and shouldn't change but maybe there is something with the color too? I'm not sure. We just swapped- my son has the original smaller 55 and my daughter has the new one. We still love this ball!"
5,Really fun!,"My 6 year old twins love their hop balls. Note that the yellow plug has to be removed before inflation (instructions were vague about that). These balls are on the large side for my (tall for their age) six-year-olds, but are still fun, and they will grow into them."
2,Disappointed,"Our active 6 year old grandson loves to jump and bounce. We bought him a similar small ball like this when he was 2 and felt he had outgrown it. This ball is way too big for him. Putting less air in it, doesn't help with the large handle he has to still try and hold. The ball was covered in an oily film, and even after washing it with soap and water, it felt weird. I was very disappointed and I am sure it will be in the next garage sale."
5,Perfect for six-year-old boy,"My son loves this. Believe it or not, it actually motivates him to do things like put away his laundry and toys because he bounces around the house and his room to complete those chores. The bouncing has really helped him with coordination, too. He's a big six year old -- well over four feet tall and sixty pounds -- and the ball is the perfect size for him. Even his twelve-year-old cousins were bouncing on it with no problems. Don't buy the cheap hand pump, though. Piece of junk. You'll need a better pump or an air compressor to inflate the ball."
4,2-stage dust collector for Small Shop,"This is a well engineered tool for the function it serves and I am very happy with its performance in my small shop.I just don't undersatnd why Jet decided to mount a relatively heavy motor on such a light plastic base!! Every time I need to move the top, I am all so fearfull that I am going to break the base plate (and I know I will one day!).Another easy improvment would be to add a few dollars to its cost and provide a few extra feet of hose."
2,Product seems defective,"It worked the first two days. Now it comes on and off. It I would have bought it from a store, I would have returned it."
2,"""Defective by design""","The item has a place to insert the supplied ice capsules, however, once I placed them in the compartment, I couldn't remove them because the opening was to small for my averaged sized hand! In addition, the unit did not cool as effectively as I would have liked."
3,Reasonable performance,"Pretty much a nice fan. Cooling is so-so, but better if you load the unit with ice (better with dry ice).Downside: noisy, somewhat flimsy construction on side panels.Upside: lightweight and provides reasonable airflow"
3,not cool,This item is not satisfying as i expected. its just like an ordinary electric fan its effect.dont recommend to a friend.
1,Not what I expected,"I didn't buy this product from Amazon, but thought it was so bad I should warn people. Like other previous reviews state, this product is little more than an over sized fan. I have another swamp cooler from a different manufacturer, and it actually cools, but this one is literally no different from my normal cheap circular fan, just louder. Except my fan doesn't leak water all over my floor. This swamp cooler came with a hairline crack at one of the wheels, obviously some kind of design flaw. It's not the only design flaw, I don't know what they were thinking about having the water volume meter impossible to read, or the place to put in the water hardly large enough to stick a straw into. It looks kind of cool, but it doesn't cool, which is all I want it to do."
2,Evaporative Air Cooler,"I purchased this thinking it would be more powerful than a fan, but less expensive than an air conditioner.You get what you pay for.The evaporative air cooler does blow out cool air, and if you are in the stream of the air, it is cool and comfortable. However, it does NOT cool the overall temperature of the room. The less expensive oscalating fan seems to do a better job, and does not have to be refilled with water or ice."
1,WHAT A PIECE OF CRAP!,"I bought two of these, and boy what a waste of money. Neither one of them works! The company needs to stop making this crap! Please save your money and don't buy this product."
2,"Fine as a fan, but doesn't cool","It has everything you want of a fan - timer, 3 speed, variable direction, remote control, but don't think this will in any way reduce the temperature in the room - at best you get a fan with built-in humidifier.It comes with ice packs, but using these doesn't make any difference either, and good luck getting them back out after using them - the hole you have to drop them in is the same size as the ice pack, so once you get your hand in there and get a grip on them, you can't get your hand back out.Update: Died after less that two years."
1,Completely useless,I completely agree with the prior reviewers regarding the blatant design flaws of this 'cooler'. It's basically a badly designed under performing room fan. If you are looking for a real swamp cooler do yourself a favor and buy another product.
1,Ineffective cooler - SPT SF-610,I purchased the SPT SF-610 from a local retailer on 1 July 2009 and returned it on 5 July.This item has many nice features but it is not a good cooler.I used it at different times of the day with the temperature ranging between 75F and 106F; it did not offer any cooling effect when the temperature was over 85.The motor is quiet but the fan running at medium or high is rather noisy.
3,Lacks Cooling,"I know I shouldn't expect much because of the price but this is more like a fan than a cooler. After adding water and the ice packs, you really don't notice the cooling and it's a bit loud. Save your money and buy a ""real"" room air conditioner if you need cooling."
3,"OK, But Not Classy and Kind of Cheap-Looking, A Few Issues...","Although this works OK, there are some issues: it won't hold CD packages that are even slightly larger than a typical jewel case, and the outer frame edge is somewhat flanged, so they don't look that good next to each other. It's basically just hunk of cheap black plastic, and looks like something a college kid would hang on a wall. All in all, I am not that impressed, and we'll probably try to get rid of the few we bought ASAP and look for something nicer-looking."
4,Definition of Love,Good piece of music!!! I want to find more music like this but know were to find them!!!!
5,TIME,THIS IS A NICE BOOK... IT EXPLAINS WELL AND SIMPLE FOR A CHILD TO UNDERSTAND................ DID NOT TAKE MY GRANDDAUGHTER TO START TELLING TIME.......................
5,Great Deal,It was bigger than I thought. I know that this is one tool belt that I'm going to be using it alot because of its size and I know that it's going to last for along time because it's from Bucket Boss. I would recommend it to anyone.
4,Good Item for the Price,The Bucket Boss Brand Tool Holster is a good item for the price. It is sturdy enough to hold your tools while you work and has decent sized pockets. The only reason I give the product a 4 star review is because the plastic clip to close it could be more durable. It has not given out on me yet though and my husband uses this product on a regular basis for home repair and projects.
4,"Great, Page Turning Read","Tom Dolby's novel was a very compelling and enjoyable summer read. I kept finding myself putting down Elizabeth Kostova's HISTORIAN to pick up Dolby's novel. They're EXTREMELY different books, but some nights I couldn't deal with the Ottomon Empire and its association with Vlad The Impaler (Dracula) and wanted something fun to read. The author clearly has (or had) his hand on the pulse of what it was (or is) to be young, gay and trying to make a name for himself in New York. (Wait, Dracula may be more closely related to the subject matter than I realized) Seriously, in several instances I found myself not liking some of the main character's (Toby) choices. Of course this is not the author's fault, he allowed his character to take his appropriate journey and we as the reader (whether we liked Toby's choices or not) got to watch from the outside in -- even if we ocassionally cringed."
2,The literary equivalent of a snack ...,"... pleasant enough but not much substance.Yet another ""coming-to-grips-with-being-gay"" story, ""The Trouble Boy"" should keep you entertained for the duration of a plane journey but you're likely to forget it pretty soon afterwards.Tom Dolby's style is uniformly journalistic throughout, i.e. punchy, and at times even quite amusing. This enables him to sustain the pace but somewhat prevents the characters from being much more than cardboard cut-outs. The flash-back to the university episode did not gel with the rest of the novel and managed to be artificial instead of adding depth.Some readers might also treat ""The Trouble Boy"" as a ""roman a clefs"" and engage in a spot who is who game that may add piquancy to this otherwise rather bland concoction."
3,Coming of age novel,"This is a coming of age novel so subtle that the main character does not even realize it. ""Toby"" has led a shelter life in the cloistered parochial school world and the provinicial Manhattan club scene, and has very little understanding of nuance in the way people communicate with each other. The trick is, and no small trick is: the reader understands the main character's quivering naivete without the author having any understanding of it himself. This gives the book a nice comedy touch.The one drawback is the rather bland writing style. If Toby can polish his writing skills a little, he might be compared to a middle-aged Jay McInerfee in the future."
4,Perfect-- if you're a 23 y.o. 'mo,"If you're in your mid- to early 20s and a gay male... this will be the best book you've *ever* read in your entire life. Otherwise, it's just a nice read with some great situations. Either way, a perfect ""beach book"" and an entertaining read."
4,Excellent,Goes deep into the pysche of the main character without getting too over the top. Excellent read.
2,"Quick fun, but nothing remains","The novel is a fast read with moments of fun, but the author seems unable to create a memorable character. Toby neds a lawyer at one point, but worries he can't afford one, even though his parents pay his rent in Manhattan and his mother just sold her company for $200 million. Huh? Many moments like this make the novel seem rushed.Alos, why does this novel have to be shelved in the gay section? It seemed pretty mainstream to me. I hate this hyper-classification."
3,The Trouble Book,"The best part of this book is the inside back dust jacket where there is a really hot picture of the author. (Unfortunately, his website is pretty bare bones with no additional hot pics.) As for the novel, it's good but not great. There's just not much substance to the story. A plus is that the book is free of the continuity mistakes, typos and grammatical errors frequently found in books of this genre, as it was published by a professional house. (The fact that I'm even making this comment relates back to the minimalist substance of the story.) But it is a first novel and we can hope that Tom Dolby will grow and grow. The potential is certainly there."
4,Simple with a Great Message,"As a child, I remember reading books about the United States that began with ""Columbus' discovery of America."" I am very happy to see a book for children that talks about the ""first discoverers of North America"" (8). The drawings are very simple and the text is good and clear. The story is divided up into four parts: The First People, Early Basketmakers (1-450 A.D.), Late Basketmakers (450-750 A.D.), The Pueblos (750-1300 A.D.). This small book could lead to some very good conversation about Native Americans and using archeology as a tool in learning more about America and its past."
2,"Yes, the examples don't work","I agree with Mr Harteveld. I typed in one example (OLEDBDepartmentATL its called, chapter 9). Typed in to better understand. First it didn't compile, then vars hadn't been initialised - several lines are omitted from book. Once working it almost but not quite works.I copied it from CD and built it unchanged. It still doesn't quite work. It nexts thru the DB ok but once you Add a rec then you keep getting error HRESULT = -2147467259 when you next, first, last, prev, ... error is way down in the atl template.This book is easy to follow as far as it goes (which is not far). Nallet's is better but very unclear. I haven't found a good book on OLEDB yet."
5,Fantastic Childrens Book!!!,"After reading Nose to Nose, I only imagined Barry would create such a touching account of Moritz's life for children to understand. These dogs have deeply enriched my own life and his book helps for children to understand how much an animal can help to change their life too. All animals are special and deserve such recognition that Moritiz has received. He is helping to bridge this gap!! Thank you for the wonderful book. We have read it almost every night since we bought it!! Looking forward to more of Moritz's adventures in the future!!"
5,Good book for kids,I ordered the book for my two young grandsons. My daughter liked it very much and said that it would help her teach some good things to her son who is high functioning autistic. She said the boys love it!
3,Read the first page,"The first page is available here. I read it, and discovered that if I was to buy this book, I would need to explain ""kidnap, rape, and killing"" to my 9-year-old. I prefer not to find that kind of detail in a book listed for 9 - 12 year olds."
4,Great for children,"Here's a way to get the young ones in your family interested in history. ""The Bill of Rights (Cornerstones of Freedom)"" is an introductory 32-page book that discusses the first ten amendments to the constitution and the rights which they are intended to protect and touches on Miranda rights, written in a language that children understand."
3,What sizes are they?,"One of my pet peeves is when basic specifications are missing from product descriptions.Looking elsewhere on the net, I find that these are for 3/8"", 1/2"", 3/4"" and 1"" internal diameter applications."
4,rain rain go away!,Get ready for the rain with Galoshes. The little boy in the story gets his rain clothes on and plays in the rain. This is a perfect book for babies and toddlers. There is one word and picture per page. The pictures are bright and colorful. Pick up this book to share with your little one on a rainy day!
2,Not an Optical Zoom,"Warning: This product has fixed optics. Although you can ""Zoom In"" from a window in Net Meeting, all it does is blow up the image. As a result, you can not get fine resolution with Zoomed-In images. I feel this is border-line misrepresentation of a product because the box indicates that the camera module itself is a zoom camera. If you don't want zoom, it's a fine camera."
2,Subpar on Mac,"The Logitech Quickcam Zoom has been a pain in the neck to use on my Mac (iBook G3/700 running Evocam webcam software). On most days the video ouptut is jerky or nonexistent until the cam is unplugged then replugged, the ""snapshot"" button on top is prone to accidental pressing, the lens cover doesn't attach securely and tends to fall off, the screw attaching the camera to its malleable base comes loose too easily, and the image quality is average at best. It did work with Evocam, but caused more grief than I figured it's been worth these past few months, so I'm selling this off and getting me a Unibrain firewire webcam instead."
4,A document of historical importance,"I guess it is about time people started looking back at the development of the trends of modern music by gathering together documents like this one. A collection of the BBC sessions of Joy Division and New Order. Nothing overly new here - it's all been released before in one way or another but it is nice to be able to see it all together in one set - rather like looking back over history.Sadly, I write this before the set is released so my thoughts are based on my presumptions - I would hope that some great cover notes are included which look at the development of the music rather than rehashing the JD/NO story yet again. A hope, I fear, which will not be realised.If you are one of those people who found New Order when you heard Crystal - then maybe this is a way to swim through the waters which brought them to the shore of the new millenium."
4,alright notebook if you are on the go!,"This is a smaller notebook computer, but mine features 512mb ram, 30gb hard drive (tiny), and a 1.4mb pentium r processor. I recived this as a gift from my mother in law secondary the her not liking the small keyboard and not getting the wireless network working. It turns out her router box was bad, and I now have had this working on a network for month now, no problems. The keyboard is a bit small, but the screen is more than adequate. Watching dvd's on here also works well, but I have had not reason to burn a cd or dvd with this yet (since I have a burner on my desktop computer).Perks: portable, resonably fast, dvd burn and play, easy wireless set up.Downfalls: small keyboard, anoying mouse pad, occasional hickup opening programs (that is why I like amd processors, just smoother), small hard drive (30gb)Still, I this is very comparable to more recent models, a price around 400-500 used is fair. Overall a very functional and solid unit."
5,"Excellent Laptop, Super Fast!","This laptop is faster that any other laptop i have been on, my 30gb hd is 75% full and its still cruising, i personally think its faster that the new dual cores that are out. 1.6g mobile processor = around a 2.6 desktop processor..fast fast fast"
3,Mr,Great computer for the price. I had to return the 1st one I had because of two minor problems. The replacement laptop works like new. I'm very satisfied with my purchase so far. Thank you
4,Thoroughly enjoyable,"It's been said before, but bears repeating that thesefolks are verrry talented musicians and the leadsinger does a great job with these tunes. Also, if youcan believe it, they do a fair job of harmonizing ...If you have any punk or contemporary rock leanings at all,this band does not disappoint - check out their otherreleases as well. My personal favorites are Stand By YourMan and Sloop John B on the 'Blow in the Wind' album,but they're all worthwhile.By the way, I Sing The Body Electric is a musicaladaptation of a poem by Walt Whitman and was first (I think)feature in the movie FAME."
5,rad brodway punk,"I just got the are a drag cd and it is the best cover cd I have ever heard. MFATGG is an awsome band. If you like punk, you'll adore this album"
4,Eased the pain,I heard this for the first time while I was getting a very painful tattoo - the music made me laugh - the song choices they cover are pretty brilliant. I was distracted from the pain and liked it enough to want to get it.
4,Punk's humorous side,"All I have to say is that while playing ""Rainbow Connection"" in the stereo system, my fiance took a listen to it, remembering the original, and saying ""that's awful!"" I knew I had a winner.The only reason I say 4 stars and not 5 is that the beloved 5 star rating should be saved for the classics, but 4 isn't bad either. Not only do they cover the songs well but their clean, crisp style makes it all the more joyous to listen to. But I can imagine the band playing in a bar and having the crowd slam to songs from the movies ""Annie"" and ""The Muppet Movie"" just because it's a good punk sound."
5,buy it buy it buy it!!!,i love me first and the gimmie gimmies! every 1 should...i'm a huge fan of musicals and one of my favorite songs is tommorrow so i bought this...i had only heard one of there songs before which was i believe i can fly(buy that 1 to)and know im in love.. fat mike is great on bass so to all u fans of nofx lagwagon and no use for a name... buy it instantly! i cannot say enough good things about this CD and me first and the gimmie gimmies...its one of my favorite cd's ever! buy it buy it buy it!!
3,It's Ok,"but not more. Their first CD is the best CD I've ever listened to, but this one is just average. Maybe not even that."
4,not a bad attempt,"this was pretty good, much cooler, better songs were remade, but cmon-summertime? and the phantom of the opera song? boring. its just ok, and dammit peoplo they arent a band, they ar guys who get together, go ahead youll see, they arent a band, the members keep changing anyway how can they be? the first gimmie gimmies had billy joe from green day for crying out loud. i love mfatgg, but this is nothing compared to their first disc, they have been out much much longer than you all think"
5,Great album!,"This time the Gimmes cover musical hits! The Sound of music, A Chorus Line, Phantom of the opera, it's the gimme gimmes for crissakes! Do we need an explanation?! Anyway, it rocks and will be in your CD player for months! Best songs are, ""What I did for love"", and ""Raining on prom night"". You should get it if you're into good music!"
3,Nice helpers for the money.....,"These transfer plugs worked pretty good with lining up the holes for the dowels, just be sure you have the work pieces on a perfectly flat surface when aligning the dowel holes. Maybe it would save a little time if there were more than just 2 plugs for each size, but they work pretty well..."
2,"in terms of picture quality, it sucks","the purple rim, hard to focus, hard to take even a clear picture...i've been a photo bug for years..... can't take a clear picture... disappointing..."
1,Don't Even Bother,"What a terrible product. I spent countless hours trying to get this thing to work. At best, I got a fuzzy TV picture and never got the computer to recognize the capture driver. The install software that came with the product is useless. You have to install multiple programs from ATI's website, if want to have any chance of this thing working right. I recommend going to their frequently asked questions section of their support area before purchasing. It provides a good idea what your in for. I finally pulled the plug on this experiment and returned it."
1,Very poor drivers. Looks great on the package but no TV.,"I am amazed at the bugginess of the drivers, even the latest ones on their web site. After a full day on the phone with their tech support guys, and a new computer, the graphics display works, but NONE of the features for which I purchased the card actually work. No TV, No FM, none. The tech support specialist with whom I spoke for some time acknowledged that these were commonly occurring problems, and gave me a scripted e-mail solution. After that did not work either, the support guys said I could keep the card and wait for an e-mail when ATI develops a solution. NO THANKS. I have never had this experience with NVidia-based cards."
5,very cute!,Very cute and easy to use. Perfect size. Goes well with my acorn cookie cutter. Also a cute idea for dog cookies
2,You get what you pay for,"Wow...what a letdown. Most of the time I have good luck buying cheap stuff on amazon...this wallet wasn't one of them. It's cheap in price, but it's also cheap in quality. Good for a kid or anyone who doesn't have much to carry in their wallet. Seriously - two inside pockets? The velcro coin pouch is cool as well as the velcro enclosure, but not for the person who more than 6 cards to carry. Handing this over to one of my kids...NOT an adult wallet."
4,"Works well, but slippery","This wallet has the functions I like, simple, foldover, space for all the credit cards in one slot. The one thing that doesn't work is the fabric. It's slippery. It has slipped out of my back pocket a few times (never all the way) and all my cards have slipped out of their slot a few times as well. Frustrating. Also-my mistake, black is hard to see inside a black purse."
5,Good Wallett,I bought this as a first wallett for my 6 yr old Grandson. It is perfect. It stays closed and holds some pictures and cash. I think it would also be fine for a much older person.
4,Exactly as expected,Good value. Bought it for my son for his first wallet. It has a nice velcro pocket for loos change also.
4,simple and light,Thin and functional. I added a picture holder and it still works great. Not fancy but fits my lifestyle fine
3,"good, but not a long term solution","These wallets work fine. But with overuse, I can see how the velcro will easily come off eventually. I am therefore careful when opening the wallet to not tug too hard."
5,Good wallet and great price,"I tired to find a good wallet that is not leather, and this is a good wallet. For folks who carry lots of bills, this wallet may be a problem for them. For people like with me who use credit cards and only take a few bills, this works great. It goes well with outdoor activities like white water rafting or even swimming. You can't beat the price!!!"
4,Works for an 11 year old,"My son wanted a wallet for Christmas, and knowing how he loses things, this looked like it fit the mark with a reasonable price. So far everyone is happy with it."
3,the wallet could be more to it,I got the wallets in good time when I inspected them I notice that the bill area was opened at one end and no space for pictures. I didn't see one online that was opened to see how it would look. a little disappointed with that.Richard A of MA
1,Sorely Disappointed,"I have not been able to find a replacement for my 2-fold nylon wallet by Rolf's. Based on the good review this wallet has got, I went ahead with my oder. It turns out that the wallet I just received lacks a secured compartment for storing dollar bills. This is because one end of this comparment is entirely open and the compartment for the dollar bills is secured only when the entire wallet is folded. I fail to appreciate how this product can even be called a wallet when there is no secured compartment for bills. Granted, commados may never need to carry dollar bills or they are trained with special skills to secure them in this product. In all fairness, it would be good for the seller to fully disclose this particular feature and let the fully informed buyers decide if this product fits their needs."
1,Do not order from this sellar,"I ordered this product on Dec 12, 2007 Had a ship date of Dec 18 or 19. Recieve between 12-22-07 and 12-27-07. Well today is Dec 28 and it has not even shipped. And two emails to sellar to inquire with no response."
5,Great New Sound,"I bought this CD a few months ago and it hasn't left my CD player since. They have a great sound with catchy rythyms and great lyrics. This CD is highly reccomended. You will not be dissappointed. Also look for their second album ""Palette World"""
3,Punk Belt,"Perfect for Halloween costume and received in plenty of time. However, it broke rather easily."
3,Just in case you wanted to know,"Just in case you wanted to knowDimensions are:4-1/2x3x1-1/4""Without such essential information, how do they expect to sell anything???????"
3,not as shown,I have been selling similar gages for many years in very low volumes as part of a reed making kit for Irish bagpipers. I am always on the look out for good prices on quality gages since the price on these has gone up quite a bit over the years. I prefer the one pictured to the Chinese made one they actually deliver. This is misleading and dishonest. The one delivered is functionally not all that different from the one pictured but it is a significant difference to me nonetheless.
3,Disappointed,"I bought the book because of the good reviews below and the low price. I was a little disappointed with Bohm's explanations and wordings of concepts that I already know. I think that it'd be difficult for someone to learn anything from this book unless (s)he is already familiar with quantum mechanics. Anyhow, the book is still a good buy considering it is at least 5 times cheaper than textbooks on quantum mech."
1,"A good topic, bad mechanics","Like a previous reviewer said, while the book is pretty insightful, it doesn't address the issue of multiple inheritance out of the box. However, it's certainly helpful for domain specific solutions. I did, as well, feel that the book did give a great deal of discerning hints."
4,Desdemona A Whore?,"This play is an intriguing retelling of Shakespeare's ""Othello"" in which Desdemona is a bored young wife dabbling in prostitution and Emilia speaks in an Irish brogue. Some might call the play feminist but it is too complex for simple labels, as it addresses many other issues, including class. ""Desdemona: A Play About A Handkerchief"" may be too racy for high school performances, but it deserves to be read and performed. It is well written and held my attention as I followed the balance of power and the handkerchief, shifting from character to character and hand to hand."
1,Instantly Forgetable,"I wanted the story to be good. I wanted to like it. I kept telling myself that the next page would make it all fall into some kind of sense. The next page will make it worth reading. That never happened.Though well developed, the characters are just not likable or engaging. The book jumps, seemingly randomly, from one scene to the next and the reader can easily lose what little focus this story provides."
3,heartbreak,"This album is very bittersweet for me. It's wonderful to hear anything new from Streetlight Manifesto, they are by far my favorite ska band ever. However, I really honestly feel like I've been gipped out of a real new album by recycling the old Keasby Nights album by Catch 22.Yes, Streetlight does do it justice, and it is just as good as the old one (although I'm not sure I'd say it's better), but they really should have made this a double album and waited to release it with another brand new album.While the music is good, it is obvious that the lyrics, while still very nice, are nowhere near the quality of Everything Goes Numb (understandably, seeing as how this was written years beforehand).Bottom line, it's worth a listen, but they could have done better. buy Everything Goes Numb instead (although if you are reading this, you probably already have)."
3,I am mildly disapointed.,"I thought Keasbey Nights was nearly perfect as it was, and if you think the original is perfect, its unlikely that you're going to like a remake.There are quite a few differences between the two albums.Theres a Tenor Sax which in my opinion stands out too much and makes the horn lines sound a little cheesy at timesThe basslines are more complicated which as a bass player i really respect but at times it seems like the bassist is just trying too hard to do something impressive while not taking into consideration the characteristics this takes away from original album.Mostly the vocals just arent as good. It's alot harder to get into.. not only has Tomas's voice changed since the original keasbey nights but he just doesnt sing with the same intensity.Overall, if you love the original, dont bother with the imitation.I love streetlight Manifesto but i think this was a bad decision."
5,Blows the Original out of the Water!,"This album is leaps and bounds above the original (by Catch 22). It contains everything you could ever hope for from a truly talented 3rd wave ska band! There are several wonderful solos that really show off the musicianship of the band's members and the album as a whole just really comes alive. There's a quality and depth to the album that is rare, especially in this genre of music.This is quite possibly my favorite ska-punk album ever, and certainly my favorite band!Enjoy!"
3,"Purchased as a gift, but the cover broke.","It arrived on time and in seemingly perfect condition. I left the plastic wrap on and prepared it for Christmas. Once the giftee unwrapped it in front of me, the front case separated from the bottom and the side broke into 4 pieces.Considering that I was very gentle while wrapping, did not drop it (or smack the case or even lay anything on top), and the giftee unwrapped with equal care ... I'm guessing it arrived that way."
1,If it ain't broke don't fix it.,"I had a very long in depth review written, but it could have been summed up in a few sentences:The original was an incredible album, but it should have stayed that way. If you want a flashier mix and a crappier rhythm section buy this, if you want an all around fantastic album, throw in the Catch 22 version that you've been listening to for the past 10 years."
3,Meh...,I guess the album was ok but to me the sound was a little bit too high school band but overall is was good
1,Very lame,"Streetlight's remake of Keasbey Nights is a total waste of everything imaginable. This remake is virtually indistinguishable from the original. There are no obvious changes to the songs, except some horn solos differ in ""Kristina...""- yet, even the guitar solo in the song is the same. This remake proves how childish and immature Streetlight has become."
2,Mediocre tunes with few musical highlights!,"Good musicians playing watered down Spyro Gyra/Yellow Jackets.They are the most expressive/comfortable playing the latin stuff, which there was not enough of."
4,Good book,I am an Industrial Electronics Tech and this is a great book to learn from the first reviewer was correct I agree with him completly..
4,Great pick holder,The only complaint I have about this pick holder is if you put 1 too many picks inside it makes them a little difficult to remove. Comes with an adhesive strip so you can attach it to whatever you want and it sticks well. If your bad about misplacing picks then you need one of these.
5,Very cool!,Outstanding product! Very handy and compact. My son was very pleased with this gift. I would recommend this to anyone who plays. Thanks for the fast shipping.
3,Just okay...,"I didn't know when I ordered this that it would have a little sticker on the back to stick the pick holder to things, and it doesn't hold very many picks. I think those are the down fall of this product. It works just as it is meant to."
4,Can't hold that much picks,"this is a great item, but it can't hold really much picks, maximum around 5,6 or 6,7 depends on how thick your picks are! but it's a great functioning item with a reasonable price! strongly recommended."
2,Plastic Holder,"I received this pick holder, and was a little bit disappointed with the construction. On the image, it looks like a one-piece, but in reality, it's made out of two plastic pieces put together. Well worth the $1, but is simply too cheap to be of much value. In hindsight, I wish I would have bought one of those more expensive leather pick holders."
1,it broke to fast,would not buy againI would try to find some thing better that worked the same waythank you my friend.
5,Great guitar pick holder,This is great when trying to organize various guitar picks. It keeps them tidy and easy to find. It comes w/picks but I was able to add several more that were hanging around the house.
5,Great service and product,A pick holder that attaches to the guitar is a great idea. It saves being overly interupped from playing when a pick gets dropped or broken.
1,No Bueno,"It is OK, but it does not compare to the ergo holder.Which you may find here:Dunlop Ergo Pickholder.The main problem with this pickholder is that it is very difficult to get your pick out, and it is extremely fragile."
3,Compare The Advice and Make Your Own Decisions,Christopher Whalen gives a good basic planning device for a Thru-Hike and the information can be applied to any long trek. The area that brings me some concern is the divergence from accepted advice regarding clothing. CW recommends cotton underwear and most who hike now advise that a quick drying material be utilized. If this is a result of the book being written before the implementation of new materials then the later editions of the book should provide up to date information rather than to just crank out additional copies of out of date material.Another way that this book could be improved is to put it in loose-leaf form so that pages can more easily be copied since that is a recommendation of the book for certain pages.There is much in the book that is very helpful but there is room for improvement.
4,Thorough Advice,"While this workbook is not as inclusive as Wingfoot's, it is more current. It also addresses some issues that are not covered in Wingfoot's. If you are planning on hiking the AT, I would recommend purchasing both..... Happy hiking. Its always an adventure..."
5,Liquid Zud and Ceramic Cooktops,"I am a landlord and ran into a white ceramic cooktop with heavy dark stains. I could not remove it with standard ceramic cooktop cleaner and many other cleansers. Liquid Zud did the trick. I had to apply it several times, and let it set for a few minutes, but each time the stain got lighter until it finally disappeared. Plus - no scratches! Zud might not work for everything, but there are certainly things where it will clearly work better than most cleansers!!!I can no longer find it in major stores, but am thrilled to find it online, and will be ordering several containers."
2,A Bust,"I thought this would be a good product, but it wasn't. Well at least for me. Someone-else might find this product useful to them, but I couldn't. I guess I like my products filled with chemicals that I know will shine, sanitize and leave a clean look."
3,zud,"I used to love this product. It would clean my shower walls really good, (have really irony water), looked every where for this, finally found it on Amazon, but it just don't work like it used to,, I wish they wouldn't change things. when you have a good product,, leave it alone,,"
1,Not worth it.,"I have only ever had luck once with this device. There is no certainty in the way holes are lined up. The drill may have a tendency to walk which will result in an offset hole. If you keep trying to use this tool and keep a swear jar, you will soon have enough for a decent biscuit joiner."
3,not quite the product it promisses to be,"I have now used the Dowljig for 2 weeks and must say that it is not quite the tool it promisses to be.seeing that it is made out of Platic, the accuracy leaves it in the 70% range.the only good part of the ""package"" is, that it comes with a range of Wooden dowls (most of them to short for my likeing) and some drills.other than that it takes some time to get in use to it.I give the product 3 out of 5 stars.Manny"
1,Very poor results,I have found through several tries that this jig just does not have anywhere near the precision results needed to be able to successfully use dowels to join wood. The drill bit tends to go in at a slight angle and can be off center. The holes just don't line up.
1,cheap price and not worth it,"Largest problem is that it is aluminum and has no hardened inserts for drilling thru. What happens is after about 6 holes, the guide hole is worn out by drill bit itself. Get a jig with hardened drill busihings to guide the drill bit."
1,Horrible,"Horrible. Flimsy, doesn't stay tight, no bushings so metal of jig immediately gets sloppy, creating goofy drilled-out holes. So frustrating. buy a better one."
1,not worth the fustration!,"this is a piece of junk, nearly impossiable to drill matching holes, Measurement scale is stamped in black, on black on the rod can not read. JUNK, JUNK."
1,more chinese JUNK,"Nothing like wasting $35 on more junk from China I agree with the sloppiness stated in other reviews, but the bits supplied with the kit are just as crappy as the rest of it, I drilled 4 holes with these bits in cherry, and they look like I drove them into a sidewalk with a hammer.CHINESE JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Wobbly piece of junk.,"I purchased mine years ago for a project that I did not want to use biscuits on. I QUICKLY found that this jig lacks any real positive stops. The workkmanship is so sloppy that the bit guide simply wobbles around as you insert the bit through it, causing misalignment of the bit, and potentially throwing off the drilled hole. Out of 10 sets of matching holes, 2 in my work piece were badly misaligned. Avoid this tool if at all possible.If you read my other reviews, you will see I rarely slam a product. I own other General tools as well and have been satisfied. I just hate this one."
2,Sander looks better than it performs,I bought this sander about a year ago. I have been disapointed with it's performance. The housing is plastic and the cast iron table mount into the plastic base lacks rigidity. this makes it hard to sand anything square considering the attractive looking table with it's 90 degree slots. The attachment bolts for the belt table are difficult to work because of he lack of clearance. You also have to remove the belt table in order to change the belt. In hind sight I would have bought a more exspensive sander with a cast iron base. Consider what plastic does if you were to sand metal. The graphite on the belt platten wore off right away. It seems a wasted addition.
3,Jet Disc Belt Sander,I thought this would be A heavy duty sander. When it showed up I was disappointed.All guards were Plastic.The disc sander table was not as sturdy as I thought it would or should be.It works ok but for the money it is pretty disappointing. This is not much better than the small portable bench top model I got rid of . I would think twice before I replaced this with the same.
2,Small Jet....,"After looking the Jet belt sanders over for a bit I decided on this model mainly due to price. Well, you know what they say... I sent this one back, ordered the big Jet belt sander and haven't looked back. This unit would be good for small woodworking or trimming your finger nails. If you want to get serious look at the 1 1/2 hp model and spend the extra coin, you won't be disappointed...."
2,in addition...,"It appears it can't convert from digital optical to coaxial, so all the devices you want to use with the switch have to be the same, or whatever you connecting the output to has to be willing to accept coaxial audio sometimes and optical other times.I'm also not a big fan of the way it switches devices. You have to teach it an IR command, but what if you are using it with a device that doesn't have a remote (say a game console, for example). Now you have one more device to adjust because they didn't want to include a remote.I haven't noticed signal degradation, though I haven't used it much yet. Over all I'm pretty disappointed because what I got doesn't match the description very closely. I should have done more research.Though I"
1,poor picture quality,"I was not impressed at all. I have more components than jacks on my television, so I eagerly awaited the arrival of this switcher. After following the directions and installing the unit, I noticed severe degradation in video signal. It is now sitting somewhere in my closet."
2,"Nepotism, Pt. 2---Electric Boogaloo","I'm not sure if Molly Jong-Fast thought that joking about the nepotism that allowed her second (and second rate) novel to be published would endear the few wary-yet-game readers she may have had left to her, but if that was the case, the joke is on her. She is not funny. She is not interesting. She is not talented. She comes across as spoiled, self-indulgent, and, most horrifyingly, BORING. She not only steals her mother's material (Material that had already been used by her mother, the actual writer)but she sucks in the retelling of it. For a bragart who talks so much, Molly Jong-Fast has very little to say. This book blew. As did 'Normal Girl'. Get a real job, Miranda."
4,"Light-hearted, spirited and funny....","If you read Jong-Fast's book in the light-hearted, spirited and funny vein in which it's written, you will find it just that. In her take on a memoir (at 26-years-old) Jong-Fast's Sex Doctors in the Basement is as good as its catchy title suggests by a writer who does not take herself, her famous literary legacy, or her upbringing - filled with therapists and celebrities - so seriously."
5,this movie this great,Every who have not seen this. i really recommend it. My husband and i stand in the movie from beginnning to end and i keeps you focused.
4,Doubled the price?,"This is a wonderful show that excites the imagination. The viewer can't help but be drawn into the interpersonal relations and become invested in the characters' fates. That said, I bought two episodes at 99 cents just 17 days ago. Now they are $1.99 per episode! Amazon, have you heard that there is a recession going on?"
5,Great story telling,"Once again, much like Firefly, and so many other fantastic Science Fiction drama's, another great one bites the dust. Great television takes time to build steam, but once it does it becomes a part of a cultural experience, i.e. Lost and Battlestar Galactica (The Ron Moore years). Defying Gravity was purchased by ABC, but at the last moment and never had time to for the regular Fall TV lineup promo's that saturate late summer viewing.According to the shows writer, James D. Parriott, the show was going to explore some incredible ideas and thoughts about existence, exploration, faith, and alternative choices. By all means, do some research on the writers vision for the show. Mr. Parriott reveals, in an interview, the direction and the outcome of the voyage of the Antares, the visions of the crew members, and what ""Beta"" is."
2,Not as good as it should or could be...,"It's 2001 - 2010 space odyssey meets Solaris and nothing more...Characters are predictable and lame, sex plays too large a role...Music is lame as you can get... Another Science Fiction let down...Is there anything original out there??Perhaps they can bring Firefly back??? Please bring Firefly back... : )"
5,Flying thru space and under the radar,"New great show. It has been a little slow but very enjoyable. Good mix of story, science, and characters."
2,"Grays Anatomy, in space.","I want to say at the onset, that I love SciFi. The only reason you could call this Scifi is because of the setting. It was a very slickly glossily produced show, but like a beautiful plastic apple, it had not taste, nor substance. It was little more then a soap opera, in space. I watched it, but was not sad to see it go."
3,Is there an RID number?,Very frustrating when the product information is incomplete and there is no one to contact. Could the sellers PLEASE specify whether or not the receiver has an RID number?
2,Not satisfied,It did not include the remote control which is necessary to operate the equipment. It was shown in the picture but did not arrive. I requested expedited shipment but it took a week to arrive.
3,not exactly what I expected,"most speeches are not in full length, so there are often the cutting you get in all other documentaries. But all in all not bad - not bad at all."
4,I never knew so much about the finger,This book is truly comprehensive and funny. It's amazing how much stuff they cram in here. I liked the weird pictures best. One odd thing I noticed was that the cover of the book is different than the graphic here on amazon.com. My book has a 3-d finger on it that actually flips you off! Much cooler.
1,not working tv tuner,I tried all 3 computer but never work for me .my opinion no rate for this product bottom line product .In short skip this product
1,Don't look for support.,"Directions were terrible and when I tried to call for support and when I finnaly found an email, It took days to get a 3 word answer back. Thing still does not fully work."
1,"DON""T Buy","I bought this looking for a ""Good""Tv card...I got this.I thought it was a Good one...READ...it was a waste.I got the Coaxial Working once then it Won't work.Pulse the audio support is horrible.It only works with the crapy program it came with no media center Support."
3,good for the money,product installed well and for the money is a good buy but you get what you pay for with this item
2,Sabrent PCI-RC Capture card,This card has a few issues with device drivers for XP. Turns out it's a Philips SAA7130 and the TV-Expert software is a minimal offering. Nothing special about the product. Device isn't listed in thge Windows HCL. Actual manufacturer's page link here---> [...]
2,ok,this tv card good ok. but i can't get the sound to work!! i try to change some setting but it still doesn't work. i guess you get what you pay for!!!
1,No Support,"I have asked the maker of this device for help and received a email that gives me access to tv software that works but is crap. I asked them for help getting the card to work with Windows Media Center. They never replied except to ask if I had the same problem with the software they sent me. The problem is that the sound does not match the video. Microsoft has tried to help, but after days of fustration I will be returning the card."
1,You get what you pay for,"In short, this tuner just plain sucks. While it was easy enough to get it installed and tuning in the cable stations, forget about recording. No sound on recording. The recording audio drop-down in empty, so no options to change anything there. Stay away from this card."
1,Sabrent TV-PCIRC TV Tuner - do not buy,Shipping and handling was greatProduct arrived; software and hardware installed easily.Video is fuzzy and audio does not work and I have done everything I can to improve this.Internet search - others have the same claim.FYI - I am a trained TV technician and worked for Compaq/HP for 10 years.
4,So far ... so good,Easy to install. Haven't done much with it yet but what little I have worked with it ... it seems to be ok.
1,Not Good,"only a few channels worked and were fuzzy,sound never worked,remote worked once then never againcheap product dont buy it"
1,"Cheap, Not Inexpensive",The principal benefit of this product is in the valuable lesson it teaches not to buy the lowest price item without first taking a good look at the product reviews. I was never able to get the card to do anything. I tried removing and reinstalling the drivers. I tried getting assistance through the web site. I tried contacting the manufacturer and they never returned my phone call. I've decided to cut my losses and buy a different card.
1,It doesn't work,"It's cheap, but I couldn't get it to work. It seems to be a problem with the drivers. I wrote to the company for help multiple times but couldn't pin them down on any clear instructions (e.g., they'd tell me to download the drivers from the internet, but when I responded that I allready did so and it still didn't work they wouldn't tell me where to go from there they stopped responding to my e-mails). I'm pretty computer savvy so if I was unable to get the thing working after several hours I don't think anyone else will be able to either."
1,Buyer Beware,"I purchased this item and was very excited about getting it... I had a previous version of WinTv and I liked it but wanted something new... as I read the specs for this program and card it looked as if I had found what I was looking for. When I installed the card and program nothing happened, I re-installed and the card began to work but the picture was terrible none of the channels matched if something was on 21 it would show 22.... half of the channels wouldn't even come on... I had to do a system restore 3 times to get rid of the program but now there is a warning that comes on when I boot my computer about missing .dll files.... Buyer beware, this is a worthless item... I have tried to get in touch with the seller and I have recieved no reply...BUYER BEWARE !!!!"
1,Not Working Yet,"I received and installed this card yesterday. It was not recognized by Windows 2000. Neither was the driver included on the CD. Sabrent's site didn't have any driver for the card, either, but did have a wonderful FAQ link about it... Well, I'm assuming that it was wonderful, since the URL was broke. I'm giving them a chance to respond before I send it back."
3,"Paid 35$ for wrong model, got this one.","To start, this card is very difficult to get working right, tried several drivers only to find that one wrong setting can lead to system recovery. Recording with it was very nice for the first week, after that every time I recorded something the sound had a loud machine noise to it.Recently I've looked up the actual model and found that in fact the model I paid for I never recieved, I got this one instead. I went for the 35$ card because of the port structures on audio were not metel, also that it is built better. I hope I can get the right model I paid for."
4,Underappreciated (agree with other review),"I agree with the other review that this is underappreciated.I did not get the remote to work and FM didn't work on mine either, but the video works well. The built-in software works, but doesn't work for digital TV (Over-the-air TV in the US). I connect my digital converter box to the RCA jack (yellow) and the picture is quite good.The included drivers worked fine.Install dscaler as well, as that software gives better control of the card's features."
1,This product fails in every way.,"I have dealt with many tv tuners that may be quality hardware bundled with crappy software, which is an easy fix. This product matches such crappy software with even worse hardware. Do not buy, this is junk. I have tried several different tuner software packages to no avail. I repeat do not buy!"
3,works awesome,it works well except the remote connection quite working after an hour and hasn't worked since.
2,Not what we expected...,"This wasn't what we expected - it gets very low quality reception and it is difficult to use. There were no instructions with the equipment when it arrived, not even how to use it. It works, but we aren't completely satisified. I wouldn't reccommend this product to others."
3,it works ok.,"it works ok;but when I installed this program in my pc, I was very confused because there is no detail direction for this. (there is no specific model name in the product; so, I did not know what to choose when installing this program)"
3,wow,finally got it to work. picture quality is terrible though. this card is cheap so it's quite expected. look else where if you want a decent picture quality.
2,You get what you pay for,"Looking through the lists of TV tuner cards, this card definitely falls into the category of cheap. I was able to get everything running properly. Took me a long time to use the mandatory program to tunnel the audio from the card to the system soundcard to the speakers.Got to work the remote but for some reason, when I activated the card via remote, it would open two instances of the program even though I pressed it once.The video looks pretty laggy and doesn't support resolutions better than average internet video clip. Definitely not a card you would want if you plan to play games on, for instance, plugging in your PS2 to it.Overall, foot the extra 10-20 dollars for a nicer one. It'll be worth it, as with most things in price."
3,not so great,"It was scratched up REALLY BADLY, so I had the surface cleaned and it was fine after that.But all in all I bought it in used condition and i think it said it was used-okay. so that was my bad.always buy used-like new or used-good condition."
1,"Terrible message, thanks again Disney","Stitch does indeed have a glitch. Poor little guy cannot help what is wrong with him, he cannot help what he does, and is labeled as ""bad"". Not a lesson I want my little daughter to internalize, that if she screws up, she is bad. Stitch isn't bad, his behavior was, through no fault of his own. Made me think of mental illness, and how we label people with it. If I hadn't gotten this movie from the library, I would have thrown it in the recycling."
1,DVD does not work,The DVD worked once. Now it will not read. I am not satisfied with this product at all.
2,boring,Didn't like this one to much starts off ok and take a nose dive. The ending was crapping were stitch all of a sudden is well when he was dying. I like the first one much more than this one.
3,Not as good as LILO And Stitch,It was a pretty good movie but not as a good as LILO and Stitch. Did not hold my 3 year olds attention like the first movie!
5,My review on a animation Sci fiction !,"Lilo and Stitch 2 was the greatest bouns features and excellent visuals ,great storyline of a funny scifi carttoon !"
3,Impressed,"I was impressed because I've never seen a Disney sequel. I loved L&S, so I wanted to give this try. The animation is great, and there are some funny parts (especially from Pleakley) also Fanning (who I dislike with a passion) isnt bad in it (mind you I didnt realize it was her until after the movie.) The one down side is that the movie is simple with no real plot line that hasnt been done before."
3,A Good Sequel To The Original,"Just got back from seeing a sneak preview of the movie on the large screen in a theater in New York. L & S2 captures a lot of the flavor of the original film, much better than 'Stitch the Movie', which was pretty much a pilot for the current Disney TV series.The plot is a little more simpler than the first film and more accessible for kids. I didn't think it contained enough of the cleverness that made the first film a favorite amoungst adults, but it does have it's own little fun touches, and Elvis' pressence is felt in the film, though not as strongly as the original movie.I won't give away too much, but do have tissues ready towards the end of the film, it's very reminiscent of the climax of 'Beauty and the Beast' and may have the same impact of the infamous Bambi's mother scene.Lilo & Stitch 2 will keep the kids entertained, and maybe a few adults will reach for the tissues as well."
5,I'm very very proud! I love this movie!,I love the original Lilo and Stitch. I also though the sequels they've been making wouldn't live up to the original. But they are great! I can't wait for the next one that's supposed to come out in 2006. I definatly reccommend this movie!
4,Good Second Act,"This one has the aliens, however, teaches about friendships too. Lilo has to learn how to handle things without her friends as they go off on to their own lives. They all struggle to some degree and ultimately all end up together again."
3,laugh a lot,"I love Lilo and Stitch, my favorite, watching this made me laugh and thats a good thing when a cartoon can do that, the kids love it"
4,Very good album by this italians!!!,"Very good power metal album with interesting twists thrown in. The guitar player is a shred maniac and play extremely well. The keyboards is also proficient, the drums discharge a tons of double bass. If you like Lost Horizon and Edguy(Hellfire Club) this is for you!!"
3,I'm surprised so many people disliked this one,"Gorgeous location, attractive males, and beautiful, NATURAL women--not the scrawny, bleached, fake breasted bimbos normally featured in softcore movies.The acting was pretty terrible. But I thought this movie was very sexy. Maybe it's because I saw the unrated version (yellow boxcover)?"
1,Absolute garbage,"This movie is absolute garbage. Why is it called Emmanuelle in the first place. Compared to Emmanuelle with Sylvia Kristel which is 7/10, this movie gets 0/10 from me. In a movie entitled Emmanuelle in Rio, I expect to see a beautiful actress with the body of a goddess and hopefully an actress who can act a little bit. There is none of that in Emmanuelle in Rio. In Rio, one would expect to see the beautiful women on the famous beach. There is none of that in Emmanuelle in Rio. What there is a lot of, is boring conversation, boring people and not so beautiful people."
1,NOT ENOUGH EFFORT WAS PUT INTO THIS ONE,"THIS TIME, EMMANUELLE GOES ON A VACATION WITH HER BOYFRIEND, WHO'S A MUSICIAN. AND AS ALWAYS, PLENTY OF SEXUAL ENCOUNTERS OCCUR DURING THEIR VACATION. BAD STORY, NOT-TOO HOT SEX SCENES, AND A VERY WEAK FINALE MAKES THIS ONE OF THE WORST ''EMMANUELLE'' MOVIES OF ALL TIME. (...)"
2,almost not quite,Possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. Rio is gorgeous. Brazilian girls are beautiful. Seems like an impossible scenario to screw up. Dialogue is terrible and the sex scenes aren't all that sexy. Music video is ridiculous but awesome. This could have been so good. Someone please send me to Rio to reshoot this.
1,Not Worth the Money,The highlight of this poorly produced dvd was the scenes of Brazil and the coast of Rio. The plot line stunk and the dialogue was atrocious. The sex scenes were marginal at best. Any romantic inclinations you and your significant other might have will be soon lost under the repetitive dialogue. Spend your money on some of the older Emmanuelle movies and skip this one.
5,Swizz Beatz The MONSTER!,"This CD is a absolute banger! All the trackz are brilliant and even the interludes are great and also funny as hell. Only negative thing is that even though 'We Did It Again' is a good and hard song I feel that it doesn't fit into this album as well as the other songs, which are awesome and I can't name any favorite trackz cause of that. Monster beats and hot lyrics make this album a must have! Swizz Beatz is here 4 eva!"
4,Sweet Beats,"Swizz Beatz really doesnt rap that much on this album, mainly is guest appearacnes, that is what brings this albums up and down. Swizz got guests with different styles form all over the place. The Big Snoop Dogg from west coast, luv u better lover LL Cool J, Young Project Cassidy, Ruff Rider Chick Eve, LOX gangsta Jadakiss, R&B Ron Isley, Down South Bling Bling Baby and his singer TQ, the fast rappin inventor Busta Rhymes, the MURDA Ja Rule, and the High time Holiday Styles. He makes all of them sound good on his album and does very little but produce, which is okay, Bigger Business is one of the hotter songs.Production: A++Lyrics: A-Delivery: B+Overall: A-"
4,Swizz Beats delivered,"I am satisfied with G.H.E.T.T.O. Stories by Swizz Beats. The whole cd is solid with the exception of the annoying intro skit, and the LL Cool J song. Swizz displays his unique style with his beats and his rhymes. Although it lacks the one song that will make your eardrums bleed, G.H.E.T.T.O. Stories is a good cd and it is worth the money."
3,"lacks something, but overall okay.","This cd feels like it lacks alittle something. It has a bunch of good star features like Busta,Nas,Ja Rule,LL Cool J, Styles P,and even Lil' Kim. The songs are okay, overall not a bad purchase but like I said seems like it lacks something. This is a cd with great artists making appearences over some good beats from the beat master Swizz Beatz."
3,You better know what your doing...,I'm very new to Maya.. This was not the book for me. It's a great book if you have had some experience with 3D in general. There will be terms that will be used that is not covered in the book.This is not a beginner book. So beware.
2,Kind of a Dud,"I think the sheer bulk of this book was the problem the author was having. He over extended himself. He tried to write about too much.The instructions are not specific enough. You can't utilize this book. Maya has way too many buttons to speak in generalities.I want specific examples. What screen will pop up? What button do I push? How exactly is my hypershade supposed to look?I think he knows what he is talking about. But I don't. Next time, pay attention to detail and do better."
2,Mastering Maya 3,Maybe thoses other guys who wrote reviews of this book work for the company but it is a big book with not much substance. Its like a 1000 pages of add copy for the software but does little to show you how to actually use the program.
3,"Biased, easy, but maya 4 comes out next month anyway","This book is pretty much as basic as you can start off (considering you already know how to use your computer)...the first 3 chapters tell you what the buttons do & when to use them (it even covers a little bit of MEL). The rest of the book has you apply it, whether it be in character animation or particle effects. keep in mind there's 28 chapters. However, the cd is just about useless. One important (and biased) aspect is that THE AUTHOR USED TO WORK FOR ALIAS WAVEFRONT...so he is very eager to say ""isnt this feature neato"" and ""wow-wee to this program"". By the way, if you have Maya Unlimited 3.01...this book isnt gonna teach you how to play with your extra $8,000 worth of toys. Sorry, one last thing...you might wanna save your money Maya 4 comes out in 1 1/2 months. (check www.aw.sgi.com if you dont beleive me)"
5,badleesgruven in central pa!,"Fantastic collection of songs by the world's most under-rated rock and roll band! This collection of wonderful music was written, performed and recorded by the badlees entirely on their own, in their own studio! Anyone who really likes creative down-to-earth music, will enjoy this cd. Song writing and lead vocals are shared by four of the band members. From the U2 sounding title track to the Grateful Dead sounding Appalachian Scream, all these song show the musical talents these 5 musicians are blessed with. You will keep this cd with your favorites for a long time."
5,Great CD! Talented songwriting!,"It is great and fun music, mixed with talented musicians! What could be better? Go buy the CD"
4,the jellybricks rock,"Okay, so these guys are pretty good. Who's to say if thegroup will ever make it outside their hometown or not, but their music is entertaining and makes a great way to help pass the time on long car trips. What more can you really ask for from a record than that?"
1,Bad book very dry and a little outdated at times,"Don't waste your time, seriously. I bought this book for a psychiatry rotation during medical school and after reading other students books from different authors, I'd wished I spent $5 more and purchased another text. From what I have seen, there are many other psych books that are better written and more current."
5,Challenging workout for intermediate yogis,"I was looking for a more challenging workout, similar to the Vinyasa Flow class I do at my local yoga studio. I did this workout this morning for the first time after downloading it to my Kindle Fire. It was great to have the instructor right next to my mat! There is not much warm up, but once you get going there is a lot of strength work for legs, standing twists, and good variations for easier levels of the more challenging poses. I will be doing this on a regular basis. Haven't done the core workout yet, but I've looked through it. Looks like a good combination of yoga and pilates. It's nice to have the two workouts to do together, if I have time, or to alternate between days."
5,Day one,I am in love with this video. I am on day one of my 7 day trial and I definitely buying it once this is over.Not for a newbie but wonderful!!
5,Great addition to my home practice library,"I love this video, I watch it at least once a week. Great workout! During my initial viewing, I could barely make it through the first segment. (I'd consider myself a beginner, only practicing a few times a week for 2 years.) It still continues to be a challenge, which is why it is in constant rotation on my video playlist."
3,Not a Compact Flash Card,I just received the item ordered and it is not a Compact Flash Card as shown in the picture and description. In fact it is called a 128 MB Picture Card on the Invoice and return document. It is physically much smaller than the Compact Picture Card in my DX3600 Camera. This needs to be fixed as I really need the Compact Flash Card and this must be happening to others.
5,Kodak Digital Camera needs Kodak Picture Cards.,"I am using a Kodak DX 4900 digital camera. I found that if you use Kodak compactflash cards instead of others for your camera, the pictures are more beautiful. Other picture cards may be a little lower price, but the pictures are not so sharp, so bright and so beautiful as Kodak's.The cards are worth for the money."
1,wrong card sent,"I purchased a Kodak DX4330 3mp digital camera and docking station along with this card on Nov. 9, 2002. The card is the wrong card for the camera. can i exchange it for the right card and/or get a refund?"
5,Great for teaching poetry to upper elementary students,"I teach Language Arts to fourth and fifth grade students. They are very intimidated when poetry is mentioned, especially writing poetry. This book makes writing poetry very practical and interesting, even for boys. It took some of the fear factor out of teaching poetry as well."
2,armrest pads,"Pads do not provide the amount of side support which I had expected.. My wife's arm still contacts the stiff armrest of the wheelchair, causing bruising of her sensitive skin."
1,Buy Craftsman Instead,"I bought both, but will be returning the General. The Craftsman equivalent, #967173, is built better. Unlike what a previous reviewer says, this particular Craftsman unit does not require you to remove the chuck from your drill.The bushing run out is similar on both units, with the Craftsman probably a little tighter - at least comparing the units I have. The Craftsman is also made of cast aluminum with much thicker and heavier support bars. There is also a spring return that should help press the unit against your work for added stability. There is a handle and more surface area on the base for holding the unit against your work and applying clamps. The General is made of injection molded plastic, and lacks all of the above features.Plus, I bought my Craftsman for the regular store price of about 27 bucks.Pretty no-brainer on this one."
1,"If you like cr*py things made in China, you would love this tool","Thing has arrived in a good looking box. Parts were not packed but just thrown in the box. Started assembling the damned thing, a nut and a bolt were missing. Vertical guiding rods had to be forced in place, in general manufacturing was using the best technology from 1870.This drill will guide you only if you don't care where you will end up.Save your $30, buy yourself a good drill bit."
1,Jams up,"Seemed like a good idea but the axel jammed up quickly after only a few uses. Also, lacks a clamp to hold smaller objects as you drill. Needs to go back to the design desk."
1,crappy,made of plastic and not accurate at all.the head is floppy so no way to get it right. might was well just freehand.
3,Saves time drilling multiple holes,"I received mine with a factory defect and returned it. I need one for a job in two days and purchased one locally for $29.99. I have used this type of jig many times over the years. These jigs are not perfect but do add speed and accuracy especially when drilling hand rail for spindles. Most of these tools look the same except for different knobs. I like the keyed chuck as it holds the bit tight, keyless chucks sometimes loosen up and the bit wobbles. Also like the on board key storage."
1,Pay Close Attention!,"What a mistake! I needed it to guide larger than 1/4"" shank bits and they advertise this to be for 1/2"" drills, but the largest bit it will accept is 1/4"". False advertising! It left me in a bind and they wouldn't do anything about it. Stay away from this company! I'd like to know what they meant when they said it is for 1/2"" drills."
1,Precision Drill Guide,"I sent this drill back , although there was no charge. I did have to make a trip to the post office and repackage the item which was annoying and time consuming.Vertical guides would not line up with scale on sides unless forced. However, when forced the bottom warped so guide would not drill a perpendicular hole for which it was designed. It also would not drill said hole in original position with incorrect scale position.I went to Sears and am happy with their model, which is made much better, has a cast metal bottom (not plastic)is spring loaded which is a great asset. Plus it was ten dollars less when you include shipping."
1,POOR CALIBRATION,"EMBOSSED CALIBRATIONS ON SIDE ARE HARD TO READ OR DESIFER. I HAD TO MARK THEM WITH BLACK MARKER TO BE ABLE TO READ THEM. YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW WHATANGLE YOU HAVE UNLESS YOU CHECK THEM WITH GUAGES. OTHERWISE, THE PRODUCTDOES THE JOB WITH IT'S LIMITATIONS."
2,Effective uses are too limited,"Like others writing these reviews, I thought this small press would be enough for my limited and just occasional uses to avoid having to buy a ""real"" drill press and save a few dollars. But after trying it on several projects, there were more projects on which I could not use it than those that I could. It is not stable unless it is secured on a larger base. This takes away from the portability. I still haven't figured out a practical use for the built in V shaped base. I'll be putting this ""press"" in the ""rarely useable"" box and get a mini drill press (available here on Amazon) for a few more dollars but will be much more useable and stable."
2,Meh,"Cant positively set tool for degree. 90 degree setting might just get you a 85 or 100.Slide bars too tight to let carrier work freely and needs too much pressure to push through.I install doors and hardware and this tool promotes a ""blasting"" out of door veneer due to the effort required to use it.Not a good buy for the professional.If you have a job that doesn't have to look good then this might be for you."
5,"Sure Lenny's no Dylan, but he still rocks.","I read the reviews for this CD and bought it anyway. I'm glad because I love it and and my toddlers dig the funky beat. These pompous critics who complain about his lyrics need to show me examples of lyrics they've written. Stone Cold Player is an instrumental song, duh. You ever heard of Green Onions? Or Tequila?"
5,I don't care if I have to buy his music a million times,"Lenny's ability to be able to write the lyrics he does, I could never do and appreciate the words he has to say. They are at times inspiring to me. I would buy this album again if he had another song to put on it and reissue it. He's an amazing artist. I wish everyone could see him for the artist that he is"
5,Lenny is supa groovy!!!,"Lenny's music is soooo cool. It has funk, pop, and a little alternative,in the song fly away. It has a neato groove and you can dance to all of the songs. I love it!!!"
4,Keep it coming Lenny!!,"This is by far one of Lenny's best in years! I don't think it could ever take over ""Are You Gonna Go My Way"" but who cares. Check out songs like ""Thinking of you"", ""Little Girl's Eyes"", and ""Black Velveteen"" to see what I'm talking about. Lenny mixes in '70's funk, '80's pure pop magic, and just enough of '90's reality to make this work. Rock on Lenny!!!"
4,"Four Stars for ""5""","In my opinion this is Lenny's 2nd best work.""Mama Said"" being the best of course.It shows his deep understanding of funk/dance/rock/pop music.He has got to be the most versatile musician I've ever heard.Sure his influences are obvious,but everyone had to hear some music first before they developed their own.What I like most about it has got to be how unashamably he does the funk thing..""Super Soul Fighter""...The first time I heard it I was blown away.I literally laughed with delight.It was like listening to a Fat Albert soundtrack.Then move on to something like ""Fly Away"" and you're doing the head bangin' air guitar thing.Mellow sounds abound with ""Thinkin of You"" and others.I could go on but suffice it to say that if you like to hear different sounding stuff from the same artist on the same CD with soooo much soul you want be dissapointed with this one!"
2,so/so,this is one of the many overrated albums of this decade.are you gonna go my way is his best&mama said is a close second.thinking of you is great.but he has done this album already.he still can't write lyrics.he is trying to be more groove oriented on this release.this album was dead until he got down with tommy hillfinger.and then fly away blew up.so much for anti-corporate sponsership? hopefully the next one will be better.
1,"Lenny ""Terrence Trent Darby"" Kravitz","Lenny is over. FLY AWAY is by far the most monotonous, unimaginative, talent-less song I have heard in many years. For Hanson fans only. I give no credit to anyone who covers somebody elses hit (AMERICAN WOMAN), except maybe Hendrix for ALL ALONG THE WATCHTOWER. The rest of it is more of the same. See ya, Lenny..."
1,Screwing the fans,"I think that Lenny and his record label (Virgin) are really screwing the fans by re-issuing this album with bonus tracks. Now, every one of us who bought it when it first came out are getting screwed out of these bonus tracks. They are more like ""bone-us"" tracks. I would have liked to have owned a copy of this with the bonus tracks because I like his version of ""American Woman"", but do they really expect us to buy a second copy of the album? I've always like Lenny and own all his cds. But, I think this will be the last one. It is not nearly as good as his earlier albums, and this little bone-us tracks fiasco is end of my being a Lenny Kravitz fan."
5,Overall Best Album,This is Lenny's best work. I enjoy this classic and timeless CD. A must have for Lenny fans all over.
3,This is okay.....,"This c.d is okay with okay tracks like ""Fly Away""and ""American Woman"".But,I do think Lenny is a cool guy and I watched this neat biography about him and I just wanted to say I think it was so sweet that him and his mom were best friends and I cannot even imagine how he felt losing his mom and his best friend.And,I do think this c.d is pretty cool!"
1,Pop,I bought this cd because of Fly Away and American Woman thinking it was a rock album. Boy was I wrong! It's funky and slow pop.
2,This album is a mild disappointment.,"I think some artists have to realize that their true talent lies in performing and not songwriting. The music throughout is quite good. But Lenny's lyrics are absolutely horrible, full of cliches and painfully repetitive. He thinks a chorus makes a whole song. I'm almost embarrassed for him. How many times in one song can you repeat ""when i look in a little girl's eyes"" or ""you're my flavor""? I mean, really. He needs to perform songs written by other artists on his next album.I really want to say Lenny is a great artist. I hope he can become one because he's got some talent. But he's not there yet."
5,vanessa toledo #1 fan of lnny kravitz,"I'm from Puerto Rico and i love to listen to your CD Lenny cause it just makes me fly away from reality and that's exactly what I wanted and needed.Thank You Lenny . Love, Vanessa from Puerto Rico"
1,AWESOME,This Cd Is great. From the 1st song to the last thats why i give it 1 star it is a masterpiece
4,Not A Big Rock Fan But......................,"After seeing the video ""I belong to you"" and hearing ""If you can't say no"", I had to give Lenny my 13 bucks for his CD. The man has been around for ages. My uncle remembers him in Cali when he was in a 3 man bar band just getting his start back in the 80's. The production on this CD is great. The new American anthem: ""American Woman"" was a big hit of his that I like and has had air play on all radio station across the U.S. and the dedication to his mom that past is very heart felt and moving, plus a great song. There were some songs that were a little too loud. But over all I don't think I wasted a penny on this one.oNe"
1,1 Star for 1 good song,There was only one good song on this entire CD. I should have bought a single if there was one
3,3.5 stars-definitely a step in the right direction.,"5 is an album that initially sounds better than it is. Three or so years ago I would have given this disc four or four and one-half stars. But unfortunately, some of the material does not age well. Don't misunderstand, this is still a good album with some outstanding material on it, but a classic? Don't make me laugh. There are definitely some ho-hum moments here. While the album as a whole may not be classic, there is no doubt that great songs like ""I Belong To You"", ""Little Girl's Eyes"", ""You're My Flavor"", and ""Can We Find A Reason"" are some of Lenny's best tunes ever. So forget the abysmally boring ""Fly Away"" and listen to some of the other tunes. What you get is a nice mix of r&b-inflected funk songs, rockers, and slo-tempo blues. An intriguing, if flawed album."
1,not good,kravitz has got the right direction in music style but he just is not smart enough to pull it off this time. fly away is too simple and boring and repetitive. his other songs are even worse. he peaked on are you gonna go my way. The only way this album makes it is if you are on some drug. even then it puts me to sleep. i write better songs and lyrics in the shower.
4,This CD is a great piece of music! It has style and ROCK!,"He is a great artist and "" Fly Away"" is a blast. ""American Woman"" is good. Some of his other songs are o.k. and some just plain s**k! It is a good CD!"
5,Lots of Groove,"5 is perhaps Lenny's best album to date. Instead of continuing in the tradition of the rock albums that he has done, he gets a little funkier this time. There is a lot of fanfare on here. The music is catchy, soulful, groovin. Highlights include Live, I Belong To You, If You Cant Say No, Thinking Of You, Fly Away, Its Your Life, Little Girls Eyes (tribute to daughter Zoe), and more. Go out and get it!"
4,Upbeat Lenny,"I've got two other Lenny Kravitz cd's - love 'em both for different reasons, but this one is best. Production value is great, very interesting songs. Great 70's/funk/soul/rock vibe. It's been in my cd player for three days straight and I'm still diggin it."
5,Better than ever!,The re-release made a great CD even better! Thanks Lenny for the music and inspiration.
5,Awesome musicianship!(collector's item w/out bonus tracks),"Everyone keeps talking about his songs. Yes, his songs are great and there is more variety on each of his albums than his peers, but what about his instrumental prowess? I'm surprised that a great number of musicians aren't declaring him one of the most talented artist of the decade. Listen to his funky melodic bass lines on this album. Any serious bass player would benifit from learning those bass licks. Overall, ""5"" is a CD chock full of excellent funk-rock w/ techno-style retro soul.By the way, I want to thank Lenny and his record company for rewarding the true fans who bought ""5"" w/out the bonus tracks. By reissuing the CD so soon after its initial release, the hardcore Kravitz fans were the only ones lucky enough to own what will become a collectors item someday. THANKS!"
1,I sold it to the store.,"I wanted the CD for the track ""Fly Away,"" which I thought rocked. The other songs were just plain stupid...I felt like I was listening to one of my parents' CDs. Track 5 showed promise, but ""Fly Away"" was the only one worth listening to. I later (1 day later) got bored of that song and it turned out none of my friend's wanted the CD. I'm glad I didn't buy it myself (I got it as a birthday gift) cuz I certainly didn't lose anything when I turned the CD in for credit towards the purchase of real music."
4,ithink lenny has an outstanding melody and percussionareas,overall a great album some songs a little too soft maybe he could beef it up a little next time alittle more power behind it as a fellow musician i can tell you power says it all this day and age in the music business but lenny your still tops in my book!!
3,NICE SURPRISE FROM KRAVITZ.,"Lenny Kravitz shows some great talent here writing, producing and arranging all the cuts here. With standouts like ""Fly Away"", and ""Its Your Life"" the album has some substance. But there cuts like ""Straight Cold Player"" which rips off ""Pick Up the Pieces"" from the Average White Band, and some of the songs gets so slow you find yourself nodding off. Other wise a good album with some good songs, but don't look for a fantastic masterpiece."
3,"Ok, not superb","Give the guy credit for keeping the style alive through the 90's, and even making it somewhat popular again. However, this isn't nearly as good as his earlier stuff. One great song, Fly Away, is being quickly ruined by overplaying on the radio stations."
4,HARD TRIP,"This is a new style emerging which has elements of earlier work! This is full blown FUNKY! All the songs sounds distinct yet very very LENNY. There is also a song dedicated to his little girl, which is just beautiful! The drums and guitar are reminiscent of the best parts of the 70s mixed with the feeling of the ultra modern focus. Loving it!"
3,Disappointed,"I should have listened to this CD before buying. I bought it for Fly Away and ended up disappointed in the remainder. As a casual fan, I should have waited for the Greatest hits."
5,Lenny Kravitz at his best,"For people wanting a unique blend of rock and funk, this album is your dream come true. If you have never listened to Lenny Kravitz before, start with this album. From the funky ""Supersoul"" to the soul-searching ""I Belong to You"", Kravitz takes you through several genres of music, a successful experiment of his talents. I must admit I was at first skeptical when I heard his remake of ""American Woman"", being a classic rock purist, but Kravitz covers this song with that same creative energy and spirit that makes this CD a must have in your music collection."
5,"Great CD, treats true fans unfairly","I have loved all of Kravitz's music thus far, but I am so disheartened that this CD was rereleased with 2 bonus tracks that I don't have on my CD. I believe that this is a cheap marketing strategy and denies the true fans (those who bought it before the release of the songs) 2 singles"
5,Explosive with FUNK!,I love this CD with all it's properties of funk...it's easy to blast in my car and not so easy on the ears but it's very cool! I like the way the words come out. Great CD!!!
5,wow!!! its a great one really!!!,"This is a great CD.I recommend it to anyone that like Lenny Kravitz music and to every one that love great and electrifying music.The songs are geting you to a new energies and it's really makes you smile when you here the beautiful lyrics and the great music with the electric guitars. Kravitz playing all the tools by himself and he does it better than any one else. Run and buy this one and you'll thanks me later, i promise you!!!!!"
1,A whole lot of nothing,"What a waste of money! I bought it because of ""Fly Away"", hoping there'd be some other good songs. i was very wrong. Don't get me wrong, I still liked ""Fly Away"", but the other songs were terrible"
2,not what you would expect it to be...,"I got this C.D. after hearing ""Fly Away"" and ""American Woman"". When I listened to the rest I must add that I was kind of dissapointed... the only track, w/ exception of the two I named, that was good was # 5 ""If you can't say no"" . Don't get me wrong Lenny is a VERY talented guy...its just that he puts out these songs that rock and the rest are almost disco...i don't get it.."
4,"Good Album, but unfair","I have been a huge Lenny Kravitz fan for about 1 and a half years, and I have all of his albums. I bought 5 soon after it came out and it took some getting used to, but now I really like it. However, I think it is selfish and unfair that Lenny reissues this album, especially because his most loyal fans bought 5 when it first came out. Virgin put reissued 5 to bring in more money for the album, and whether Lenny wanted to or not, he is either dissapointing or losing his most loyal fans."
3,Lenny Kravitz-5,"This album contains good and bad songs. I found that there were only 3 good songs to it. However, I love Lenny Kravitz, especially ""Fly Away"", ""Live"", and my favorite, ""American Woman"". The others are OK, but people have different tastes."
2,Is there a 2 and a half star rating...,"I bought this cd because of Fly Away and American Woman thinking it was a rock album. Boy was I wrong! It's funky and slow pop. It's not that bad though. Thats why I gave it 2 instead of 1. 2 and a half stars is what I'd really give it. Don't buy it because of Fly Away or American Woman, buy it if you are a fan of Lenny Kravitz from before."
2,Must Try Harder,"Very tame and repetitive, lacking drive, muscle, originality or entertainment value. There is only a hint of talent, much is pure formula and pedestrian. Overall a negative experience. I listened to it twice. It didn't improve."
1,what happened?!,I do NOT recommend this CD. The only songs worth listening to are Fly Away and American Woman. I don't know what he was thinking with all the other songs. I'm disappointed in Lenny Kravitz.
1,pointless,"This re-issue is pointless because without the two new tracks, the album is already awesome. Songs like ""Fly Away"", ""If you can't say no"", ""Thinking of you"" and ""it's your life"" are already destined to be Lenny classics anyway. Of the two new songs, ""American Woman"" is already available on the ""Austin Powers"" soundtrack, and ""without you"" offers nothing special, so there's no point in getting the reissue."
2,FLY AWAY? when this repetitive turbulence makes me vomit?,"Concerning Lenny Kravitz's ""popular"" song FLY AWAY; I've never heard anything more repetitive and annoying in my life!! If you want to hear the same stupid lyrics sung over and over again, check out The Police; at least their monotonous lyrics are tolerable. Even though I haven't heard the rest of the album, I'll never in my right mind buy it, because I know FLY AWAY is on it. I'm rating this 2 stars because I know it is unfair to bash an entire album because of one song. I'm sure it isn't too good. After all, FLY AWAY is the only song from this album I've heard on the radio, so why should the rest, that have not been on the radio, be any better?"
2,Lenny's no Jimi Hendrix (but he desperately wants to be!),"Let's face it--African-Americans doing rock music is a extremely small group. You had Jimi Hendrix, Living Colour, King's X (lead singer Doug Pinnick), and let's throw in Prince for the heck of it. As for Lenny Kravitz, he tries very hard to be a cross between Hendrix and Prince, but his songwriting skills (or lack thereof) slam the door in his face every time. Little digital tweakings aside, ""5"" sounds remarkably similar to his previous albums--one or two really catchy songs (here being ""Fly Away,"" which will stick in your head like glue and is already the soundtrack on an car commercial) and the rest tired-sounding psychedelia. But he plays an instrument--he's a decent if uninspired guitarist--and writes his own songs, and those skills are getting rarer by the day in the current pop music world. Eventually he will come out with a greatest hits album--wait until then to spend money on a Lenny Kravitz album if you're a casual fan."
2,The old Kravitz was better!,"I have been a big fan of Lenny Kravitz for a while and I appreciate the fact that on 5, he was addeing new studio sounds and trying to change his sound a little bit. Unfortunately, it seems to me that Kravitz is heading in the wrong direction with songs that go on so long. Almost every song has a decent melody which you get quickly tired of after he plays it 10 times. Every song seemed never to end. Also, the lyrics seemed a bit corny, especially on ""Fly Away."" You'd think somebody of his artistic talents could conjure up at least half decent lyrics. The one's on this album are bad. Still, I like his cover of American Woman and it's one of the two good songs on the album. All of this is to say that I know Lenny is trying to change his sound a bit but I don't think this is the best way to do it."
5,Good Quality light.,"2-18-13. I ordered this Sylvania H6054 Standard Rectangular Halogen Headlight Bulb (Low/High Beam), (Pack of 1) from Amazon.com because I didn't have to go ""shopping"" to the local automotive store. Yes, I paid a bit more for it on Amazon.com (Walmart is $8.88), but the service from Amazon is very good and the product is one I have used for many years. The service life of these lights is very good and they do not require replacement very often. I keep one at home for a spare, since it assures quick replacement when one does fail on my 1986 Nissan pickup."
5,Fits Probe I '89,"Now my good old Probe shines ""bright like a diamond"" again! Very easy to change, super fast shipment USA -> SUI!"
5,So much cheaper than anything else I have found,We looked online for a really long time for a replacement headlight for my daughter's 2001 Jeep Cherokee. This was by far the cheapest solution and worked and fits perfectly
2,"Good Performance, Poor Longevity","I have been installing (and installing and installing...) this lamp in my 2000 F250XL 4x4 for 3 or 4 years. I have analyzed the problem upsidedown and backwards. I have no voltage spikes, overvoltage or any other conceivable electrical issue that would contribute to reduced life. I can get about 4 months max out of the low beam afterwhich I operate on high beams aimed a hair low just to get some value out of the purchase. Local prices are awful but I see online pricing is much better. I have polled other owners but no one has these lamps, nor have they experienced premature burnout. I expect to leave the 6054 on the shelf in the future in favor of any alternative I can find."
5,cooking with the other coke !!!!,"hi i gave this book as a gift to someone and they love it ,but after recieving it in the mail i was looking at it and will have to get one for myself the reipies look great .thanks"
5,Great fun,"For all children with imaginations and anyone who could learn something, this is a great little book about exaggerators and how to catch them, with a whimsical side to a mythological fact of how the armadillo got his ears. As a children's librarian I love this for storytimes."
2,On the bright side the illustrations are sumptuous and rich.,"Unfortunately, the book has only unsympathetic characters. The armadillo while he repeatedly tattletales, doesn't learn how to improve his behavior, despite the grief it causes him and others, instead he is physically stopped by having his large receptive ears chewed down by the alligator. All his friends are mean, they throw ""humongous hissy fits"" ,they don't allow him to drink at the watering hole and they gang up on him. The writer lapses into using vague words like ""what-for, how-come and why-not"" that weaken the text and meaning.My 4 year old boy overall found it a bit sad.On the bright side the illustrations are sumptuous and rich."
4,All Programs Considered,"We're a middle aged couple who carefully research large purchases and long term contracts before we commit. We think cell phone contracts, as a group, are terribly unfair to consumers, but, in that group, Verizon may be the best - you need to look for coverage areas and what's best for you - if you live along the East Coast and do all your calling in that area, then Verizon is the clear favorite, look out if you live in Northern Oregon or in Appleacia, roaming changes there are real high - we almost never go over our allotted minutes and are satisfied with Verizon. Other companies have poorer (less) ""free time"" and more add-on charges (buyer beware)"
4,Nice book,"Nice book, helpful. Nice pictures. I had to buy this book for a college class. Expected a slightly different book, but its nice nevertheless."
3,Very sturdy and well constructed,"Very sturdy and well constructed, but the pockets are not deep enough. I use it for plein aire painting and the pockets need to be deeper to keep some ""painting stuff"" from falling out. I will use it in the garden where it will work great."
2,POCKETS TOO SHALLOW!!!,"I was really looking forward to receiving this to organize all my tools and was very disappointed. The majority of the pockets are too shallow to hold real tools. It's like its made for tiny baby tools. I really wish I had read all of the reviews and come upon the ones that mentioned this fact. Very, very disappointed with this product."
3,Shallow Pockets!!!,"Only three stars because the pockets although plentiful, they are very shallow. I do really like the overlap design with inside pockets. I don't have to worry about the velcro strap coming loose or the weight of my tools making it slid down. I use this for going to the back of my yard and my volunteer garden projects. I wanted something to hold my hand tools on the outside. This doesn't do that. I still have to put them inside where the pockets inside are too shallow as well. On the outside, I do use some of the pockets for alcohol swabs, hand wipes, sharpies and ink pens. Even the pen slot pockets seem shallow as well. If I figure it out, I'll post a picture so you can see what I mean. I would return it but it's spring time so I need it every day. I'm definitely buying another one but at the store so I can check the pockets before I buy it."
5,awesome ep,"just like all of the other reviews, when i first listened to the cd i was skeptical..after listening to it for a couple of days it quickly became one of my fave's! although they stick to the old sound in ""sixteen"" and track number 4(i forgot the name! oops! :) the rest of the songs seem a little harder and it sounds great! i definently reccomend this cd! i am a BIG homegrown fan and have been for a while and this cd just makes me love them more! :)"
5,Wow....addictive after a while,"like the others who previously reviewed this, after the first listen, I wasn't too impressed by EP Phone Home. But after listening to it 6 times in one day, I can honestly say that this is a great ep. Adam's basswork is improved on this ep. The biggest difference on thnis album though is the improved harmonies. On every track, the harmonies are unbelievable. Watch for the re-worked version of no way out. First time I heard it, I thought it was horrible, but now I realize how damn good it is."
4,polymer processing and structure development,this book helped me with my mst project in chemestry i hope it will help other people in school and other places too.
4,85%!,"Thats as much as Arthur would give me, the 15% was genrally knocked off for spelling or grammer, and thats coming from a Geordie! Good book full of factual processing techniques detailed with structural formations of various polymers in various procesess. If your looking to find something to help with polymer structure formation throughout the various stages of a process from the melt to shape stabilisation, youll find some answers here."
4,A good fantasy read,"The setting takes place on earth and the Greek gods on high. They decide to play a game with vulcan making twelve swords, each with a special power. The swords are given to humans who are spun in a fantastic plot of world domination and even god killing. At times a bit of megalomania comes in but it is such great read, you won't be disapointed."
1,gag,"read several of these, could not finish the omnibus. Awful awful. Husband finished it so he could feel DONE, and ""the ending is good."" The rest is poorly written with a wandering plot a poorly described action. I was rarely sure what characters' motivations might be, as the characters barely existed."
5,Excellent,This is a truly excellent yoga DVD. The description of the poses wonderful. Jason has a very serene voice and the DVD is very friendly to someone just beginning yoga.
3,casual listeners can skip it,"Fans must have it. Obviously there is some filler here and a lot of stand out mixes of already amazing singles. It is really fun to put these in your CD changer and hit ""random play""."
3,DJ's and Techno Purist Need Only Apply,"I'm breaking rank with the rest of the reviews. Is it because I think it's an awful collection. No, it's just that it is so unlike the rest of the CD's they have put put out. It is like being in a club hearing the same song over and over again. If I was on a budget I would buy the DVD ""Everything, Everything"". That is an experience which it is impossible to watch sitting still- ya gotta dance! But let's say you're a DJ, this box set is a MUST for the beats."
4,Excellent technology review of the promise of optics,This book provides an excellent review of the present and future application of optical science. I found it useful in providing reference points and applications for optics in the real world. Several policy directions should be taken note of by the US government. I am especially interested and doing research in the direction of LEDs for energy efficient white lighting.
5,every other review says it all,"I can't add anything new about this product, I just feel like I need to add my 5 stars and spread the word. This stuff works! After we used it we felt foolish for how long we put up with the thick white film that our hard water leaves on dishes and glassware. Absolutely a must have."
5,Glass Magic,Here in NE Wisconsin our water is hard and our old dishwasher was leaving mineral deposits on everything. Our new dishwasher was installed a few months ago and the installer recommended Glass Magic... we tried a couple of boxes and found that it worked great! The local price per box was high... Amazon provided a better deal when buying a carton and getting free shipping!
1,hard as a brick,"I have ordered this product before and it was GREAT. This time the product quality was POOR. I blame the distributor of the product, not the product manufacturer. In the package of 8, 3 boxes were granular as they should be. The other 5 boxes were as solid as a brick. Checking the numbers on the boxes, the 3 boxes had the same number and the other 5 were of another number. So evidentally produced at different times. I am suspecting the 5 ""hard as a brick"" boxes took on some moisture in a warehouse and totally set up. I have already notified Reckitt & Benckiser, the manufacturer of the product and they sent me $5 worth of coupons for the $25 worth of poor product. Not much of a compensation! R & B suggested notifying Amazon - thus I am writing a review. Anyway, I received 5 boxes of product that I cannot use and thus far feel ""ripped off""."
1,One solid lump,"The powder is completely stuck together in one big hard lump. It's either old or it got wet I'm not sure, but it's not usable!"
5,Simply Wonderful!,"I knew that I would love this book, but I did not know how much. The format is great. The pictures are nice and clear, and BIG. This book makes me wish I was alive in the 20's and 30's. Well worth the price."
5,"Vionnet, A designers sourcebook","This lovely book describes Vionnet's life and creative process. The author examined various garments from several museums and created diagrams and directions to recreate them. Though many styles would not be worn today,The process of design could easily be adapted to todays fashions. This is a valuable sourcebook for clothing and costume designers...Beautifully photographed and produced."
5,Read this book NOW!,"Meg Wolitzer's The Position is worth the read if only for the retro seventies references. However, that is only one of many delicious parts. The characters are incredibly well drawn - Wolitzer can reach into the minds of children, young adults, middle aged ""adults"" and seniors with ease, transitioning perfectly from one to the other. On top of that, the story is equally compelling. The Mellow children have to deal with parents who made an unusally bad judgement call by posing for a sexually explicit book when their children were young. The impact this had on each of their lives is what drives the story. Wolitzer never hits a false note."
4,"""electric forgiveness""","Sex, irony and subtle tragedy reign throughout the novel with sadness and love intertwined. This book was certainly entertaining but not life changing. I would recommend it for a 'light' read; it's a good beach read with a little raunchiness. Funny that 'electric forgiveness' was the trademark of the parents sex guide yet forgiveness was not the families strong suit."
4,Our Bookclub book for October,"A bit risque, but actually quite fun to read. It is the book of the month for our neighborhood bookclub and our meeting is on Monday, so will be interested in seeing how the rest of the girls felt about it."
4,A QUIRKY NOVEL WE ALL CAN RELATE TO,"Parents can be embarrassing but usually it is average childhood embarrassments - an odd nickname, washing your face in public. But the parents in the book take it one step further - one big step and it makes for very neurotic siblings.The Mellows (the word Mellow is quite in contrast to their love for each other), the two write a book on sex and their love in it - in great - very great detail. Naturally, their children are totally embarrassed. Thirty years later - the Mellow couple has divorced and remarried several - quite contradicting from their love. The book then shows how the children have grown and coped in their parents' world and shows ""you are what you are."""
4,Warm and Wonderful,"Jesus is all about love and women were quick to realize it. No matter where they came from, they came away from an encounter with Him changed. Horrocks did a warm and wonderful job telling their stories."
5,Amazing,I recommend everyone to read this book!!! I loved the detail and the emotion and getting to experience each woman's time to be with Jesus Christ!! I was sad that the book had to end.
2,a little disappointed,"When I picked up this novel I expected some depth. What I found was a story that did not quench my apetite. I felt that it lacked real meat. The bones where there but I was not satisfied. I almost felt that wolfe was trying to be the next Dan Brown. However, she did not get to that point because there was not enough substance. Sorry Ms. Wolfe, I am sure (as your students inform us) that you are a great professor, but your book left me wanting more, and not as in a sequal."
5,A passionate and powerful novel especially recommended for readers of faith.,"Written by English teacher Suzanne M. Wolfe, Unveiling is a Christian novel about a divorced woman working on an art restoration project. As she removes layers of grime from what may be a lost Flemish masterpiece of the Crucifixion, she gradually uncovers the misery that has been obscuring her soul - repressed emotion concerning not only her divorce, but also past sexual abuse and a forced abortion. The burdens of the past weigh upon her, but the dawning of faith and understanding help her in her search to restore what time, neglect, and harm have defiled, both externally and internally. A passionate and powerful novel especially recommended for readers of faith."
1,Not Impressed!!!,"This book is sold by a ""Christian"" Publisher. I did not find any Christian value or interest in this novel. There are even outside of marriage-sexual-undertones, definitely not characteristic of a Christian novel.I found Rachel, the protagonist to be flat, dull and without personality.There is also a major discrepancy in the book. I can't remember the exact chapter, but at one point Rachel's assistant Pia once again goes away from Rome to perform research in a different part of Europe. A few pages later, Pia, the assistant that went away to perform research is standing in Rome as part of a conversation. Did the editors and author not catch this? This bugs me in a published novel, such a simple mistake can make abook seem ill-written.Definitely NOT a must read!Just my 2 cents"
3,factual mistake,"In the beginning of the book there is a factual error that has me questining the validity of the rest of the information. It is impossible to fly direct from NY to Rome from LaGuardia Airport. LGA is a domestic airport in NYC with the shortest major commercial runway in the US. A direct flight to Rome would leave from JFK or Newark.The rest of the book was interesting, but a bit thin."
3,Does the job,"Not a bad apron for the price. I broke the plastic buckle where it attaches to the belt. Now instead of an adjustable belt, it has a knot tied in where the buckle is. For a hard working individual, who uses their tools in an agressive manner, look elsewhere for metal buckles. For the weekend warrior, this works fine."
3,Good as long as you don't have to bend over.,"I bought this so that I could use it to carry some small tools and a bottle of glue when I need to install wood moldings on the job. It has good sized pockets, as well as some small ones for things like pencils or nailsets, but there is a flaw. I only used the apron for a few weeks because I could not stand that every time I needed to bend down, a nail set would poke me in my stomach, or I would get glue on my shirt from the glue bottle. The pockets just sit to high up on the belt for me."
4,tool belt,"Like the tool apron, wish the waist belt was wider, when the apron is full, the small belt digs into your waist."
2,Buckle comes loose.,"I am in the construction business and work with a tool belt on most days. I received this as a gift and was happy to give it a try. The problem I had constantly with this belt is that when I would bend over the pressure exerted on the buckle caused it to pull loose. Now if I were a person with a huge belly then maybe I could blame it on myself, but I weigh 136 lbs. and am fairly trim in the waist. Doing trim work, baseboard, casing etc. almost every time I bent over (which is constantly) the tines would pull from the buckle and the belt was on the floor. Not productive, and a hammer or tool hitting a finished floor is quite counter-productive. Didn't work for me, but I like some of their other products."
4,a good tool for the finish carpenter,the Bucket boss gives you enough pouches to do the job without you having to worry about bulky tool belts scratching your work. Perfect for the finish carpenter
4,Best of Scott Joplin: 50 Ragtime Favorites,"If you like ragtime, you should like this CD. Although the sound quality seemed a little inferior, the quality of the songs was above average I thought. The tempo of the songs was superior to that of Joanne Castle's songs which I think are played too fast. I think the CD was definitely worth the money."
5,"Informative, entertaining, an excellent read!","How kind of Dougall to be sooo generous in sharing his personal life with us on such intimate detail. The book was actually fun yet gave me insight into the life of a psychic. Even though I have been psychic all my life, I have met very few people like myself so it was comforting to read about his story and his life being psychic. It isn't the easiest thing being psychic where you have to live your life just like everyone else but also have a window that is constantly open adding alot more to the picture. It was nice to know that there are others who share the dilemma of living with the added dimension of extra sight or vision or whatever you wanna call it. Dougall does this with humor and is able to laugh at himself and I thank him for that. Great Read!!"
4,A Good Read,"I bought this book during my summer vacation into the wine country where I booked a room in a B&B; for a couple nights. I was thoroughly entertained.It is an excellent autobiography by psychic reader Dougall Fraser. It is a story of a young man as well as a story of a psychic. The author vividly illustrates the world in his eyes to us, a world in which people come with an aura that can be read. It is a life story that is full of everyday struggles and joys, but with a psyhic twist to it."
4,Great organizer!,"This product was actually less expensive than buying it through Duluth trading post, which is where I have gotten these before. Its a great product. The best part about it is that the lid is very tough to open without actually lifting the plastic tab. I have no fear of losing all my parts and pieces if it goes on its side which the very handy handle comes in very useful for. The different compartments have curved bottoms and sides so that its easy to slide the tiny screws or parts or whatever that can be hard to get out of sharp corners. The other plus is that it doubles as a seat! Used in conjunction with the bucket stackers, and the bucketboss type outside organizing pouch, these products turn an ordinary bucket into a very handy, versatile toolbox.Bucket Boss 01056 Bucket Boss 56-Pocket Bucket Tool OrganizerBucket Boss Brand 15054-CS04 4-Piece Super Stacker Kit"
4,"Good fit, holds a decent amount of weight","Sturdy bucket cover, decent quality. Note that it doesn't cover the entire edge of the bucket, so if you work around water or dust, it will find a way in to the main compartment."
4,All I could ask for,"I have owned this product for several years and anyone needing small hand tools easy accessible could not ask for more. Very pleased, I was concerned the lid would fail after extended opening & closing but so far so good."
3,questionable...,"If you are looking for something you can place on top of a bucket, look no further. This ""storage bucket seat"" is easily placed on the top of a bucket. It will not go inside the bucket, or hover over the bucket, although one could (theoretically) place it next to the bucket with predictable results.This ""storage bucket seat"" does not make a good lid. It does not seal, and it has no mechanism to secure itself to the top of the bucket. The item's carefully calibrated gravity-dependent engineering may be disrupted by activities such as moving or transporting the bucket. You'll be best off if you move the bucket where you want it, and then place the ""storage bucket seat"" on top of the bucket.The lid to the storage area is well designed as well. It covers the storage area completely! Not one of the compartments was left uncovered when the lid is closed. The lid even sits in a slight recess, so that when the ""hinge"" breaks due to fatigue, the lid can still be placed above the storage area."
3,Not a true cover,Everything about this item was as I thought it would be except the handle exposes the inside of the bucket. You don't want to accidentally leave it out in the rain or sprinkler as it will fill with water.
3,Bucket Pro(?) Seat,The cover for this item just doesn't close properly. It's left and right edges will not stay tight to the base.
5,SPREAD MORE LOVE AROUND,"This CD came to me almost at the same time as the tidal wave 'Tsunami' hit South East Asia, including my hometown country of Thailand. All 6 provinces in the South were ravaged by this mother earth's wrath. Thousands of people were killed just in Thailand alone. So I'd like to take this opportunity to express my deepest sorrow for those who lost their loved ones. And after I got a chance to clear my head and listen to this CD, I found that it contained the very message that can be passed on to those who're less fortunate than us, let's spread a little love around as Mr. Worley told us to do. And for you 'Jam' who almost lost your life at PP Island, I miss you. I MISS MY FRIEND!"
4,unexpected delight,"After seeing ""I Miss My Friend"" on CMT, and thinking this is pleasant but bland, I was utterly surprised by the album has a whole. What a lot of great musicianship, humor, and bluesy-blue grass/country! Plus he throws in a country western tune ala Django Reinhart on track 9. This guy, and his band and arrangers, are no ""Achy-Breaky Heart"" pablum-pushers. What a delight!"
1,Did Marilyn French REALLY write this?,"Formulaic, tedious and stereotyping. The subject was compelling and intense, but the way the story was written detracted heavily from what could have been a powerful novel. The characters were incredibly one dimensional and stereotypical. Their behavior time and again came as absolutely no surprise. Very disappointing, especially since the Women's Room, and Her Mother's Daughter were both such powerful and compelling books!"
4,BSE is notorious also in Japan,"I wonder why no American reviwed this novel in this site.In Japan a few cows with Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy were found recently and the fact that it could be transmitted to human was not officially announced AT ONCE from the Ministry of Agriculture. The Ministory also concealed importing bone meal (used for livestock) which might be contaminated with BSE.In this story bad fellows, not the government, conceal an outbreak of mad cow disease in their ranch. The author will explain to you the history of BSE, Kuru, or Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease. I don't buy the treatment of CJD by a person not-licensed to medicine. That's the reason I rated this book 4 stars."
4,"Good Story, Very Good Illustrations","Similar to Dr. Seuss' ""The Sneetches"", only instead of removing stars, the main character in this story (Shoeshine Whittaker) starts out by selling shoeshines. Set in the old, wild-west, Shoeshine Whittaker rides his wagon into dirty Mudville and smells opportunity in shining the townspeoples' shoes. But Whittaker finds himself in trouble since the townspeoples' shoes won't stay shiny. He then proceeds to clean the town. But, the townspeople are then upset because the shiny town is hurting their eyes! The clever Whittaker figures his way out of trouble, and leaves with a pot full of money.Interesting Story for 3-8 year-olds that will leave children amused."
2,"I agree with ""Sentimental Sludge""","Another Amazon reviewer said, ""It contains no foul language, no overt sex, and no violence."" That's true, and that's maybe why it was so mind-numbingly dull! I love Christmas-themed stories, so one has to be really bad to disappoint me this much. It's the only David Baldacci book I've read, and I thought maybe it was an anomaly, since he seems to be quite popular. But I think I'll take ""Sludge's"" word for it and not read any others."
4,Take the Trip!,"David Balducci takes a break from thrillers to take the reader on a Holiday ride on the rails. Most of the characters on this cozy cross-country Christmas cruise are kinda cardboardy, and we all know the genre and seasonal requirement that they're all bound to Live Happily Ever After The End. But there is a refreshing relationship to Mark Twain and even a mystery mixed in as a sidecar. This is recommended fare - why not book a train trip and read it then? Take the time to relax and enjoy civilized transportation. Also, check out Friends of Amtrak to see what you can do to help preserve this endangered mode of mobility.Reviewed by TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer"
4,A good holiday romance,"A very good holiday romance. Don't want to say more than that and give it away! A book light and warm and wonderful. It didn't take long to read because the pages flowed so easy. I haven't read any of his other books, but enjoyed this one every minute!"
4,Fun,"David Balducci is a truely gifted storyteller. Like all his books this is a great little story. It dosen't pocess some of the intrigue, deception, and something I enjoy, a little violence. Enjoyable book but not quite as good a my favorite Balducci - The Winner."
2,This can't be Baldacci's work.,"I won't repeat the comments made by other reviewers, because I agree with them that this book is a big disappointment. I have read all of his other books and enjoyed them. I have the sneaky feeling that his 14-year-old daughter wrote this, and as a loving Dad he wanted to make her happy. His name got it to the publisher's, but it's still a book written by an adolescent."
2,The Derailed Christmas Train,"This book sounded like a third grader wrote it. The plot changed directions every other page. I agree with the other poster who said that maybe Balducci's kid wrote it. The train travel information was good and thankfully it was short. I can't bring myself to ever read his work again. I came on this site to see if it was just me - and it's not! Maybe those of us who didn't dole out extra stars are just too cynical but I, for one, could not wait for this to be over!"
2,"Trains, no planes Movie script not a book",The train history was interesting - the characters were believable especially the amtrack employees.It seems everyone who reads this book thinks it was written to be a movie. The insights you get from 'reading the book' just are not here. Could have used more depth of emotion instead of just cute character sketches.Nice holiday feel good reading is also predictable. But I would definately see the movie.
1,Awful!,It's a good thing I got this book as a freebie through my book club because it is certainly not worth the cover price. I thought it would be a nice read for the holidays but I only made it through the first 100 pages and finally decided it was not worth the time. I've enjoyed several other of Baldacci's books but the Christmas Train was hardly worthy of an amateur.
2,Least favorite Baldacci book.,"I have read many books by David Baldacci and had high expectations since I enjoyed the others. However, that was not the case with ""The Christmas Train."" I did not enjoy the stereotypes that plagued the characters. I did not want to hear about how 'large' one of the passengers was and how tight her pants were so many, many times, for example. I also found many parts of the book predictable. I did enjoy hearing about the character's unique personalities when they were not being steretyped but that did not happen regularly enough for me to enjoy the book."
1,The Christmas Train,"So Awful that there are no words to decribe how awful, even painful, reading this book really was.It was as if some one who was a fan of AMTRAK and train travel kidnapped Baldacci and submitted this ""I CAN READ BOOK"" for fourth graders in his place. I have enjoyed almost all of his work even though a few might not be prize ""Winners"", but this can't be his.At least the others had plots, characters and interest. So many cliches,corn and just plain bad writing. How could this be possible? Loved ""Absolute Power"", ""Wish You Well"",""The Simple Truth"". Liked ""Last Man Standing"" and ""The Winner and ""Saving Faith"" were OK.This new peace of dribble was just sad!!!!!!too. Does Nicholas Sparks know you attended his writing class???A friend had the audio copy and the narrator (a good actor who plays the VP on West Wing) did a dredful job as well."
1,The Christmas Train,"Very predictable. I kept hoping for something really extraordinary to happen, but it never did. Baldaccis' other books are much , much better."
2,Really Baldacci!!,"I like this author. His other stuff that is. This story was predictable, juvenile, boring and just beyond annoyingly stupid. If you like his other character driven books, then skip this. I found myself speed reading everything tenth word just to get through it."
2,Everything But The Kitchen Sink,"This tried to be everything: a romance, a mystery, a travelogue, and even contained several references to Mark Twain--but in the end failed to live up to this reader's expectation of anything but a Christmas story, and not a very well thought-out one at that. The train lore and geography were its saving features. From the author of ""Absolute Power,"" I would have thought there would be more action, but no--this too fizzled out after straining the limits of believability. Way too much coincidence and sappiness, even for Christmas. For a Christmas suspense novel in a snowy English country setting, tryChristmas is Murder (A Rex Graves Mystery), which at least doesn't try to be serious."
4,Charming,"I don't know what took me so long to find this little gem. I read Baldacci AND read him while I ride trains! What an oversight on my part.This book has it all: A cross country train trip, star crossed lovers who rediscover each other, a film crew, a boy's choir, an avalanche, crooks, men of the cloth, sage car attendants, circus folk, young starry eyed elopers, Amtrak lore and a big dose of holiday cheer.OK, this is not university level literature but it sure is a good yarn. bg"
5,Cozy Christmas Journey..,"The Christmas Train is a pleasant read at any time of the year although especially at christmas.You feel like you are reading a cross between the warmth of 'Polar Express' and eccentric Miss Marple. From almost the first page you meet unusual characters and as the train journey travels on you are drawn more and more into the lives of everyone on board.Helpful staff, gusty carol singers, eccentric old women and a priest (to name just a few) all come together for a journey of a lifetime.Sit back relax and enjoy the ride,as that is what this book is all about. The story begins slowly idling along perfectly for the beginning of the story,then toward the middle of the book it picks up memento and there you are hurtling towards the stories final destination! A heart warming light read, great lovable characters, engaging tale and surprising twists......Enjoy this book for what it is a sweet, warm, cozy, Christmas 'Journey'"
3,"Fun, but fell flat","This book had fun characters, but little done with most of them. It would have been better to have fewer characters involved, and get really intense with them. Also, I think it would have read better in first person, with facts revealed gradually in dialogue or thought processes, instead of reading like Amtrak's biography and travel brochure. Who cares about that stuff? Way way too much of it. There were individual sections that were good, and made me laugh. Agnes Joe, for one! But overall, the constant forays back through Amtrak's history, Tom's history...and even Mark Twain's history... was distracting and boring. The characters, like I said, were fun, and had potential, but they were left just short of becoming believable. It was a fun read if you aren't expecting David Baldacci. It was more one-dimensional like something in a Harlequin or Silhouette book. I agree with another reviewer...this could be a made-for-TV cheesey Christmas special."
4,All aboard,"I'm not a regular Baldacci reader, though I have enjoyed two of his books. The Christmas Train, however, is a major departure for Baldacci. This is not a mystery, and there is no villain to nab....just good warm hearted storytelling about a train journey. The book has a lot going for it, love, confused passion, and the inevitable romance trains seem to exude in novels from decades back. If you're a lover of trains you'll want to experience this story. If you're a sucker for heart warming christmas story, you'll also want to read this book. If you're both a lover of trains and christmas stories, then you're doubly in luck. Get this book and read it."
5,a great ride,"Tom Langdon, a burnt out journalist who is trying to discover what went wrong with his seemingly ideal life, is forced to travel by rail to california to meet his sometimes girlfriend for the Christmas holidays after being banned from air travel for two years. Along the way he encounters the most bizarre group of fellow travelers, the most talented and loyal train crew imaginable, a blizzard, an avalanche, a film crew and a wedding party. His travels become a journey of self discovery when he encounters Eleanor (Ellie) Carter, the only woman he ever truly loved but lost many years ago. I haven't ridden the rails recently but my cousin has and she assures me this is not typical, but this is fiction. Baldacci treats us to a fascinating history of train travel and some very amusing stories while establishing his plot and introducing all his characters. The story is heart warming holiday fare and I enjoyed the ride immensely."
1,1 star -only cuz it can't be lower,"The only suspense - could I make it to the end? Well, I did, but only by skipping every second page. Every ""scenario"" he concocts is more ludicrous than the previous.Don't even pick this one up at the library."
4,The Christmas Train,"And now for something entirely different. Baldacci is an excellent writer and he proves it with this lovely tale of trains, snow and Christmas. Totally unexpected from his ""thriller writer"" side, these characters are fully developed to a point where the reader actually cares what happens to them. Worth a read at this Christmas season."
3,An Enjoyable Holiday Novel,"The Christmas Train, by David Baldacci, is an enjoyable read with some interesting tidbits about the history of the railroad. As a holiday novel, it is worth about three and a half stars. As a read at any other time of the year, or for the ""mystery lite"" portion of the story, it is less effective. There are some nice elements regarding the main character, Tom, running into a former girlfriend. To me, the book lacked sincerity. Portions of the end left me feeling a little cheated, but for the most part the book was fun to read. A have appreciated Anne Perry's Christmas stories a bit more. The reviews on this book seem to be split, leading to an average of 3.5 stars, this seems to be about right."
3,"Ok, But Not Quite Up To Speed..","Hmm.. something tells me that Amtrack's PR department had a little something to do with this book! This book reads like an ad for Amtrack. Having never read any of David Baldacci's other works, I bought this book because of the Christmas theme. I was really hoping for a heartwarming story about the holidays. Although it is set in a christmas setting, it's mostly about the train! A little bit of Amtrack history would have been interesting, but it feels overdone to me.I did enjoy the love story aspect to it, but it really wasn't as developed as it could have been. All in all, The Christmas Train was an average read. A nice read for the holidays, when concentration is at a minimum!"
4,Not what I expected,"I was so impressed by David Baldacci's, The Winner and Split Second that I couldn't wait to get more of his stories. With the holidays approaching, I thought The Christmas Train might help put me in the mood to start my shopping early but...I don't know. It wasn't a 'bad' book. It was well written, and all of the information about Amtrak was very interesting. It just was hard to read. Not exactly boring, but it didn't draw me in or hold my attention the way the other two books did...surprising since I love romance novels. Frankly, I can't remember the last time it took me more than a couple of days to read a book. This took me about ten days.Maybe I'll read it again someday and see if my first impression changes. And for those wondering, I read it in October of 2011...I'm just catching up on posting some reviews now."
4,Wonderful break from the norm,"Others have said it better. Baldacci is a very versatile writer who can work a mood. I read this a few years back when I needed a break around the holidays. It's wonderful, relaxing, fun and not too complicated."
5,The Christmas Train,The misunderstanding regarding the purchase of this used book was dealt with professionally and to my complete satisfaction. Sheryl
5,great gifr,I loved this book. I bought six and gave it to all my girl friends for Christmas. It was a nice gift that you didn't have to dust or find room for.
1,Was this a children's book?,"Wow, what a disappointment. This book reads like a children's book. Contrived, simple minded and sticky sweet are the first adjectives that come to my mind in describing this book. It was a painful read and if not for the fact that I just can't make myself quit reading a book once I start it, I would have it put it down early on. One very good thing, it wasn't a long book.David, I love your past work, but this one ran ""off the tracks."""
3,Trying too hard,"DB tries too hard on this one. It's meant to be a light hearted Christmas story, but the laughs are forced and come off as too cliche.The Christmas spirit is the only thing that got me through it, and the fact that it's only 250 pages."
1,"Weak writing, strong disappointment","A dismally weak effort. The concept of trains and Chritsmas sounded fasinating, until I started reading. Contrived, slow moving plot combined with routine characters and insipid dialog make this a giant disappointment. Are publishers this desperate for material?"
4,"LIKE A GOOD, LATE NIGHT MOVIE","Reading ""The Christmas Train"" is pretty much like watching a good, old movie late at night. You don't ask much from one of those movies. You just want a good story with some decent drama and maybe a little humor,even if the plot is predictable. There doesn't have to be great acting, just performances that let you believe the characters really exist while you are watching them. And you need a more or less happy ending, even if it is a little sappy.Well, there's the book. Predictable, sort of sappy, and not a sentence of brilliant writing in sight. BUT, you get the rest of the ""movie"" , too: a fine story, interesting people, and a happy ending.All of this out of a train ride on which the main character meets up with the woman he loves after years apart from her, while, of course, his current gal suddenly shows up to get between them. There's a thief running loose. There's a deadly blizzard, blocked tracks, desperate....Well, you get the idea. Just like a good old movie."
1,Not worth it,"I was hoping for a nice story to read on vacation but what I got instead was a headache. It was so unrealistic. It felt like the author was ""trying"" too hard for a romantic, feel-good story.Pass."
2,I don't know why I kept reading...,"I don't know why I kept reading, but I did. I guess I hoped the story would redeem itself. I agree with every negative review here. Please don't read this book thinking you've got a cute little Christmas story to take you into the season. It is a waste of time!"
1,Sponsored by Amtrak,"I generally find David Baldacci to be a fairly middling writer of second rate, though enjoyable, thrillers.And I love books about trains. But the Christmas Train is a third rate book which reads like it was written by Amtrak's publicity department.It is boring, trite and an insult to all good Train books.Don't buy it."
1,crap,After a brilliant book like absolute power i do not believe an author could think of a crap like christmas train. It was like reading a Mills and Boons
1,Just bad it took alot out of me to keep reading,Just bad!! I dont know how I keep reading this book. It went no where and the charactors where bad. Then there is an avalanceh that happends out of no where. It's a horriable christmas book that you should skip. Maybe the only good part was the person who was stealling stuff from people and even when we find out who it was it's still bad. Just bad.
1,Crazy Train - All Aboard,"You would be crazy to waste your time with this book. I picked it up as an audio book rental from a cracker barrel on a recent trip and what a horrible book.The book itself was bad and the guy they got to read it was even worse. I would have rather listend to NPR in pig latin vs. this book.For those giving this book rave reviews...are you serious?? Are you being paid by the baldacci's? The train engineer didn't think to back the train up until the engines ran out of fuel. They blew the snow off with a helicopter. Dumb - Dumb - Dumb - Dumb - Dumb. Did I mention that it was incredibly dumb?Sorry, I don't write reviews but this was so horrible I couldn't let anyone else make the same mistake I did."
2,story dragged on for too long,"The core of this book is a love story, surrounded by a passenger cast on a cross continental Amtrak train. Overall the novel is a disappointment. Basically the first two thirds of the book was a painful read. It drags on and on with dull and what-is-the-point subplots that prompted me to give up reading several times. But I managed to endure until the part where the train was hit by the avalanche. So it finally got to the climax of the story and it gave me a reason to keep going. The union of Tom and Eleanor is sweet, though the love story itself is so contrived and unreal. 2 stars for adding some twists at the last couple chapters of the book."
3,It's ok.,"Ok, I will admit that David Baldacci is not even close to the best wordsmith out there. I lamented to my friends about the beginning of chapter three: ""Outside,the air was very cold..."" If you don't understand what my issue with that phrase is, you will probably have no problem with this book.I was pleasantly surprised that, despite its slow start and Baldacci's often lackluster prose, it was a decent book. I wasn't upset that I gave a few hours of my life to it. The story is fun with a few interesting twists at the end. If you don't go into it expecting literary greatness, it's worth a read."
3,Parental Guidance Suggested,"My family listened to this book on the way to Grandma's for Christmas.A little stilted at times, the kids laughed out loud and we all enjoyed the happily ever after ending with the surprise twist.HOWEVER, other parents, be warned: there IS some repeated bad language and while there may not be overt sex, there are plenty of references to it, including a discussion of performance enhancing herb and ""naughty teddies in Christmas colors"". Thankfully my four year old thought these were teddy bears. The tooth fairy and Santa may also be ""exposed""-we turned the volume down when the discussion headed that direction."
4,A Nice Christmas read,"A great story about people doing nice things for each other! A definite ""feel good"" read! This book was recommended by a local book club."
2,Boring....,"Boring and predictable.... read it because of book club, and most of my friends agreed with me... only plus, my desire to travel in a train at one point in my life."
5,Awesome short book,"It has humor, romance, adventure and a twist at the end that will leave you saying ""I never saw that coming"". An adventure on a train. It's an exciting feel good story/book. I've lent my copy to a friend and purchased two more as gifts."
2,Wanted to love this but...,"I really wanted to like this book. I enjoy Baldacci's writing style, but it seemed like he tried a little too hard with this one. Think about every cliche and far fetched idea u can imagine, and try to sell it as a Christmas story. Look, i understand the concept of a Christmas book. Something sad happens, then something nice happens and you feel better. However, this book seemed like too much went wrong, and felt like it had no soul. It certainly didn't warm me up at all. The characters lacked any depth and i felt no empathy towards any of them. There are plenty of better Christmas books out there. The only saving grace was that its a very quick read. If you want a warm and cozy Christmas story, look elsewhere."
4,"Nice diversion, a ""feel good"" tale of second-chance love...","This is no masterpiece you will need to own or to read a second time, but it is worth reading once if you are a romantic at heart, or are curious about what a cross-country train trip is like these days. Tom and Eleanor are the main characters, lovers who broke up several years before the book opens, and who are reunited (to the astonishment of each) on an Amtrak adventure. There are fascinating details about how the passenger train crews do their jobs, and how train travel, usually safe, can have its perils. Many of the secondary characters are delightful. The novel ends with a couple of surprises I did not see coming, which is always nice."
2,Easy read,It is an easy but boring read. Story is slow & characters aren't that developed. I only read it because it was the December selection for one of my book clubs.
3,"An entertaining, though familiar, story with good humor.","Tom Langdon is a Journalist who is banned from flying after an argument with overenthusiastic security personnel and who sees a story opportunity, as well as, a journey into self discovery with a cross-country train trip at the holidays.Aboard the train, he meets up with many interesting and likable characters and also with his lost love Eleanor who he was close to marrying many years ago. To spice up the story Tom's current girlfriend surprises him by boarding the train and asking him to marry her and raise 8 kids with her.The train with the passengers is the perfect setting for the Christmas Holidays and the author knows how to bring the magic of Christmas to his paragraphs and with the snow avalanches they go through on Christmas Eve, this is a train ride no one will ever forget."
3,Froth and bubble,He must have been in need of some loose change -- pleasant enough but eminently forgettable -- can't think why he bothered .
5,A fun story,"I just finished listening to the book, and it is a fun read! It may be not be as deep or developed as his other books, but it has fun characters and a wonderful surprise ending."
4,Original and interesting storyline,Romance with lots of twisting and turning mystery--all wrapped up in a long-distance train ride at Christmas time...one could almost feel the rhythm of the rails and taste the bourbon in the lounge car. I appreciated the scattering here and there of history lessons about the passenger railrays and loved how the author acquainted me with characters who exuded both originality and real human warmth; I hated to say goodbye to them.
1,Love Boat Rides The Rails,"There are two good things about this book: the dustjacket and the title; everthing else is as flat as roadkill and a lot more stinky. This book should be flushed down the toilet because it's a load of crap. It's as if someone took a Love Boat script and exchanged the boat for a train. Agnes Joe, a large and at first, bullying female, is actually an undercover railroad police officer, and the priest who steals and returns other people's property isn't a priest, just a poor man who lost his wife and two sons. After reading this book, I know how high school English teachers feel after spending the weekend grading term papers. I returned the book to my bookseller. If you loved the Love Boat, you'll love this book."
1,Just Terrible,"I cannot believe this book got published. It reads like it was written in about 15 minutes - at the most. We passed it around during the holidays and it got to be a big joke - we all agreed - it was one of the worst books we'd ever read.The charactors are predictable, the outcome is obvious, the ending makes no sense.Where do I get my money back !!"
1,Pass on this one,David Baldacci has some good books (ex. the simple truth) but one has plot holes and poor writing.PASS ON THIS ONE
2,Not What I Was Expecting,"When I settled down to read ""The Christmas Train,"" I thought I was going to read something that would put me in the spirit of the season: A book with a little charm, a dash of whimsy, and maybe a warm-hearted character or two who would add that extra something to this holiday tale. Sadly, I couldn't find any of these elements in this book. Two of the characters, Ellie and Tom, seemed more annoying than endearing, and even the choir boys didn't tug at my heartstrings as I think they were supposed to.I enjoy reading David Baldacci's thrillers, but I feel that he could have had a little more holly in his heart when writing this Christmas story."
3,Christmas story that warms the heart,"Get back to basics with a thriller after reading this. Last Man Standing is pretty good. Sovereign Rule and 4 Blind Mice look to be good too. Okay not your average Baldacci. This isn't a thriller it's a Christmas story. Sort of like David Baldacci is following John Grisham's footsteps. Grisham has Skipping Christmas, Baldacci has Christmas Train. The story's good. It'll touch your heart. It's not great though."
1,The Worst!!!,"This book was such an incredible disappointment - If I could rate it lower than one star I would.I bought this as a Christmas gift for my mother. She was nothing less than polite, but I - having forced myself to finish it - could do nothing more than apologize for having wasted her time and my own. This was drivel at it's worst. It was boring and predictable with dreary characters and a storyline that evaporated after the first few pages. If you're looking for a preachy, smaltzy ""lesson"" story from the not quite religious right this may interest you. If you're looking for a good book with interesting characters and a plot, do yourself a favor and pick something else."
2,The Christmas Disappointment,"Boring, dull, predictable, uninteresting, unrealistic....the list goes on. Obviously, this was conceived and written under the heading of light reading and is not meant to be a timeless literary classic, but still, the author could have put a little more thought and effort into it. A five-foot boa constrictor on an Amtrak passenger train? Really? And the protagonist, a Pulitzer prize winning journalist, thinks it a good idea to release it into a fellow passenger's sleeping compartment? You get my drift; don't waste your time or money on this one."
5,delightful Christmas tale,"what can i say about this wonderful book? it is perfectly lovely!it is about faith and romance and love and Christmas and trains and adventure. it's about finding yourself and your life, it's about knowing who you are and deciding what you want and settling for nothing less. it's about maturity and true, commited love.on the first page it says that this book is for anyone who loves Christmas and trains. that just about says it all."
3,The Christmas Train,"The Christmas Train story moves along nicely with a good surprise ending but not his best work. More like a ""learning along the way"" attempt. I enjoyed it but it was also easy to put down and do other things too."
3,Cheesy Christmas Fare,"This was all right. I like to read a cheesy Christmas book during the holidays, and this fit the bill. I did enjoy the details about traveling by train. That part was fun."
4,"More than just ""sentimental sludge.""","I normally am not a big fan of books like ""The Christmas Train,"" but I have to say I was hooked from the start. The main character is extremely likeable and Baldacci keeps the action moving at a very crisp pace. There are several colorful characters and the novel reads just like you were walking around on a train ride, bouncing from one character and scene to the next. The ending is a little much with one twist too many, but I thoroughly enjoyed the book and would highly recommend it to anyone this Christmas season."
2,Incredibly badly written -- not nearly as good as his others,"Admittedly, I had high expectations, having read almost everything Baldacci has published, and after browsing reader reviews here. But this one just doesn't cut it for me.The plot is straight from the Canterbury Tales, without the depth of interest. The style is circa Mark Twain, but (in this book at least) D.B. lacks Twain's wit or his wisdom. The novel is so badly written I didn't care about the plot or the characters, just wanted it to be over. So it was, about 2/3 of the way through."
1,Not for me,"This book was the most boring and mundane book I have read in a long time. I didn't read it through; I couldn't. To me, it is for someone with a limited vocabulary. I'll never pick up a book by this author again."
3,Ho Hum,"I didn't NOT like it, but there certainly wasn't anything memorable of my reading of ""The Christmas Train,"" except that I read it on a train. If you're able to skip this one, you won't miss it."
4,Light Christmas reading,"Where did all the ""Bah Humbug"" in all these other customer reviews come from? The Christmas Train is light Christmas reading that doesn't present itself to be anything other than that, and thankfully so! I've read Baldacci's other novels and enjoyed them but I certainly didn't want to read a murder mystery thriller set at Christmastime! The book cover, book flap and length of the book make it obvious that what you're going to get is a little bit of fun, feel good Christmas reading. I enjoyed the book, it even had a few good laughs in it. It did however seem an awfully similar to Jerry Jenkins Twas the Night Before."
3,"A good read, but.................","A typical Baldacci thriller, kept me enthralled but he ran out of plot ideas and finished it rather hurriedly and a little bit 'over the top' - to put it mildly!"
1,Pay Attention to the Bad Reviews. They are Right On!,"I picked up this book immediately after reading Grisham's ""Skipping Christmas."" When I first started reading this book, I thought it was going to be a lot better than ""Skipping Christmas."" I was soon disappointed. It ended up being as insulting to the intelligence as ""Skipping Christmas."" I would have to think really hard to figure out which book was worse. I'm trying to figure out if it was part of Grisham's and Baldacci's book deals to write really lame Christmas stories and that they waited until the last minute and threw this crap together in order to meet a deadline. I really can't understand the good reviews that this book got. This book is not worth your money or your time."
1,A poor showing for Balducci,"Many of the reviews were better written than this book. It is insulting to pick up a book clearly marketed to adult readers and find it to be so woefully adolescent in every possible aspect, and that is being kind. How does such pap get past the editor's desk?"
5,Like a 1940s Movie...,"This wonderful book reminds me of the kind of story you'd see in a 1940s movie...romance, suspence, great dialogue--attention grabbing and vastly entertaining...Bravo, David Baldacci! When the reader is finished with this book he/she will have the Christmas Spirit.Also recommended:Christmas Gifts, Christmas Voices--inspiring and heartwarming!Christmas Jars--another 1940s movie type of story. Excellent!"
4,Makita 18V Metal Cutting Saw,"Got this tool for a great price, it came with out a box or original packaging, not that it matters because that would just create more trash. Came new and works perfectly. Love this saw I used to have the older 18V metal saw with the Ni-Mh batteries that worked great too. The reason it got 4 stars is because Makita changed the metal collection system and it does not work as well as the older model. But it works just like its supposed to, cuts like butter, deburs the cut and has no sparks when cutting or dust. I would definitely recommend this tool to anyone doing light metal work, like angle iron, conduit, pipe, channel, and square tubing. Again I don't cut 1/2 steel with it, but I do cut 1/8 and 1/4 steel."
4,A good album for those who want varying tastes....,"My favorite track of all is the bonus track DJ Spinna Remix of ""What Am I Gonna Do"". This remix is slamming! Definitely popular with the New York style House music crowd."
2,Not in the same style as 360 Urban Groove,I was disappointed in this album versus the previous one and don't recommeend it unless you've listed to it.
5,Simply the best.,"This is the best book on medal collecting out there. Period. Combining detailed, color pictures, specific award criteria and a comprehensive thoroughness it easily outdistances any other medal collectors guide in *any* field (Third Reich, British, American, Imperial German (would that there was one even half as good as this)). Only Previtera's ""The Iron Time"" can match it in quality and ""The Iron Time"" is limited to investigating one award (The Prussian Iron Cross) so it has a very narrow focus despite it being a five star book in it's own right. Schmitt & McDaniel's book has set a very high bar that any ""comprehensive"" medal collector's book issued in the future will have a struggle to match. Not only that the publication of this book helps legitamize the collecting of the ""evil empire's"" awards unlike any other publication from the past. Well worth it's price."
4,WOW!!!,Love this large poster of Gerry....how can you go wrong with an almost lifesize picture of him hanging on your wall???
3,Worth It For The Shirt,"Unfortunately, I did not learn my lesson with Synergy Entertainments other release of 'ATOM AGE VAMPIRE', this release of Roger Corman's classic from 1959 'THE WASP WOMAN' looks like a second generation transfer off of a 16mm print. However , the purchase is worth it for the tee shirt which is a stunning transfer of the original one-sheet poster for the film with rich colors so that's why this review has 3 stars. Go for the shirt and use the DVD disc as a coaster as you wait until the Shout Company ,hopefully, will release a proper digital transfer."
4,Explore another time and other cultures,"The author's descriptions intice you to see and smell all that is experienced. Thought the protagonist is a little irritating for a while, she develops as you will hope she does."
3,Could have been better,"For anyone who enjoys historical romances, this is definately the book for you. It is set in British India and openly discusses the colour issues of the time. The main character is an Army wife who comes to India but is quickly dis illusioned about her husband. Then she falls in love with an Indian doctor who has been brought up in London. It gives a great insight to the mind set of both sections prevelant in the Raj in India. Worth the read although can be a bit slow at times and it doesnt seem like the author has researched India enough to set the book there. Enjoy it!!"
5,Fast shipping from Amazon,It works and so far so good. Half the price from Kragen/Auto Zone.Thank you.Tony
2,"Not the expected artists, beware","Not the expected artists as you might think. It's more of a modern version of all these songs with a D.J. mix. Still sounds alright, but not even close to the music you would expect"
2,Worth what you pay for it.,"The apron showed up quickly,that was a plus. It fades quickly when exposed to sunlght,not a big deal . Within a week of using it around the shop,the fabric where the stitching attaches one of the pockets towards the center of the apron, started to rip. Not the stitching. It stayed intact,the fabric it was attached to was tearing loose. It appears to have been from snagging it on something while moving around the shop. Still,I expected better.Otherwise otherwise its an ok apron for the price."
2,Better ones out there,"I love Microsoft but this product you can only use with Microsoft XBOX and it costs a lot more for similar features that a Linksys wireless ethernet adapter would do. Compare this product to the Linksys wireless game adapter. You don't have to go in the Xbox and setup anything with the Linksys. With the Xbox you have to go through setup on your Xbox and on your router. With Linksys, only setup the router. I bought the Linksys WGA and it's awesome.Also if you ever stop your xbox live account you can only use this with xbox. What if you bought a Sony Playstation or PS2, you won't be able to use this one on it. With the Linksys, you can use any game console. Just my opinion :)"
1,4 hours in - still not working with xbox live,"I'm using this adapter with the MS MN-500 802-11b base station router (cable modem). The xbox is upstairs and 1 rooms (about 50 feet away - 1 ceiling [wood] and 1 wall). I find the network with a low (to very low) signal strength (I cannot connect to XBOX live since my IP address cannot be located (tried both automatic and manual address entry). The nice people at MS have no answers - waiting for instructions to their database. Waste of time (3 hours) and money so far. Anybody else have this problem - if you figure a patch email me please - is running a hardline my only option - despite spending money - using the optimal MS hardware configuration - still no opportunity to pay MS my money for xbox live. Dopes,"
2,not that great for the 360 or the original,"the reception on the original xbox was horrible even with a network extender, it was always dropping the connection.but on the 360 it had one bar but it never dropped a connection, but it was a little lagy"
1,NOT COMPATIBLE WITH WPA ENCRYPTION!!!,"Based on other reviews I had high hopes for the Microsoft Wireless G Xbox Adapter. Unfortunately this model MP-740 does NOT support WPA encryption standard. While it does support WEP encryption, WEP is extremely insecure & crackable thereby putting the entire network at risk. While WPA is susceptable to dictionary attacks when the encryption key is weak (less than 20 characters), keys between 20-63 in length are (for now) considered the most secure way to go without installing a VPN server. For anyone truly concerned about the security of their network, this product is unacceptable. If all you do is play Xbox games & you have no other computers connected to the network, then this product would be fine."
1,was not compatible as stated,This product only works with the first generation xbox. Alot of these are over the internet and say they work with xbox and xbox 360 but i could not find a way or anyone who knew how to make it work. It has been returned and I am waiting for my refund as promised.
2,Save your money. Buy the B variants,"Don't buy this overpriced adapter from microsoft. The reasons for the extra $50 is the microsoft brand and the g format. You can play online without either of those. Buy the logitech 802.11b (wga11b). its half the price and does exactly the same thing. Don't worry about what the sales rep at best buy said, hes just trying to get you to spend the extra money."
1,this is not the wireless device you want,"Don't waste your money on a single purpose device. Instead buy a Cisco Linksys WRT54GS and install the latest Sveasoft Alchemy firmware to use it as a multiport wireless ethernet bridge. W42 supports WEP while later versions are sure to support WPA or better. Since the Cisco Linksys firmware was released under GPL anyone is free to distribute the firmware so long as it includes the source. Google for ""sveasoft theindividual"" to grab your legally-free copy today."
3,Once Connected its Great but Getting there is the Problem,I bought this product under the impression that it would work right out of the box. In some ways it did and in others it didn't. It connected to my network and then ran into a road block. After spending a few hours with custormer service the problem was finally iorned out. It turned out to be that the channel on the router needed to be changed but that was not in the troubleshooting guide. After setup it worked fine but after buy plan a few hours to get it up and running.
2,All work and no play,"After hours of customer service chats (customer service is very nice) and long conversations with my broadband and microsoft router customer service, I could not get this product working. I have the mn-700 router so it should be a no brainer. My computer it less than 50 feet from my xbox, with a clear line of sight. My signal was low, at best, and sometimes it didn't pick up the signal at all. However, even with a signal I got error after error.I bought a 50 foot cable, and within minutes I was gaming, so I know it was the adapter. The adapter was shipped back today.While it's a great idea, wireless for the xbox isn't really up to par yet. I envy those who got this to work, however I can deal with hooking up and taking down a cable rather than dealing with dropped games and unreliable signals. Hope this helps with your purchase."
2,Not WPA,This adapter works OK but it should be made clear in the description that it is not WPA compatable.
3,I just saved $90!,"You can, too!!! This product is totally not needed if you have a laptop (which is why most people have wireless in the firstplace). From my Mac, all I did was go into system preferences > sharing > internet > and click ""start"" to share the internet access. Then I used ethernet cable (cat-5) and connected my laptop to the back of my xbox. Im sure you can do the same if you're running windows. Im sure this product is great, and it works right out of the box, but why spend the money if you don't have to? Hope this helps save some of you some cash."
4,Microsoft Wireless-G Xbox Adapter,Expensive but it is easy to setup unlike the D-Link adapter that burned itself up in short order. Recommended.
2,"no WPA, no PSK",does not support WPA PSK so is not very good.somebody upgrade the thing. Typical microsoft problem.
3,I Need to Amend My Previous Review,"I need to amend my previous review. If you are going to use this as a Media Center extender with the XBOX, take note that MSFT reccomends that you do all of that on a seperate network (Wireless A), while you do your computer functions on Wireless G. Therefore, it might make sense to get an A/G gaming adpater if you have future plans to get a computer with Windows Media Center and you intend to connect wirelessly."
1,Unless you have a lawyer stay away from this seller,I ordered from this seller and while I received my item on time the packaging was horribly torn. The item was not compatible with my system as the item description stated. I sent the item back for a refund. After a MONTH of rude e-mails I finally got a lawyer involved and was prepared to go to small claims court if I had to. This guy is a sleaze who obviously works from home and couldn't give two flying craps about his customer or his business ethics. My advice is unless your willing to have a lawyer on stand by just in case don't do business with this guy. He's a crook and a thief and I'm going to let everyone know it
2,wrong product,"my mistake but my system is an xbox360 and this adapter is for xbox. I need to sell it, so contact me if you wish to buy."
3,"Not perfect, but gets the job done.","I bought this to use with my 360 (you have to set it up using an Xbox, so be warned, if you don't have the original Xbox, do not get this for the 360). It works and works fairly well. It's a bit slow, but I don't game online with the 360 as much as I use Xbox Live for downloads and whatnot, so I'm not needing anything all that fast. This is probably not the best product if you're looking to bump up your multiplayer gamerscore on Rainbow Six: Vegas 2, but it'll do fine if you want to merely download a tv show or the occasional demo."
4,Works as a network bridge too,"Please read all of the comments and then take these points into account as well:* This can function as a bridge for other devices (i.e. other computers), not just for the Xbox 360 or Xbox. Setup may require an Xbox though (not sure about that). I'm actually writing this review while connecting wirelessly with my laptop using this adaptor as a wireless bridge.* I've had this for about 3 years (if memory serves correctly), and I am happy with it. I used it on my Xbox for a couple of years and now I use it with my Xbox 360.* It isn't future proof if you are looking for advanced security (beyond WEP) or looking to upgrade to 802.11n. That's the only reason that I dropped a star.* You might get a better price using a network bridge (i.e. a general networking product, not one explicitly labeled as a gaming bridge), but this adaptor has better compatibility that the bridges that I've tried. Setup is easy with this product compared to others."
4,Great Device...WORKS FOR ALL SYSTEMS,"Easy to set up adapter that works fantastic. It's great being able to play wirelessly without dragging cords! Fast connection, even without direct line of sight. Also after you program it using your XBOX all the connection info is saved to the adapter, which means that you can connect it to your PS2 (or other computer) and it will connect to the network. Only downside is that you can only program it using the XBOX dashboard, but do that once and you're all set for all of your systems. I use it with the MN-700 wireless base station so I had no problems with compatibility. Great buy for anyone looking for wireless fun!"
3,"Pretty interesting, but don't take too serious.","I read this one without a lot of expectation. I had already picked out my school. However, I must say that the author is right on with the information about Dallas. There is actually a skyscraper about a mile from where I live and there is a horse pasture about a mile in the other direction. I can only assume that either the author is from Dallas,TX or has done his research. For fun reading only."
5,Highly Recommended,"This book explained 18 commodity futures seasonal trades and use simple breakout method to capture that trend.Each strategy has it's own entry time, stop and trailing stop level. Author provided detail example on each strategy using pretty long historical data (most of them has 20years). Similar to author first book ""Ultra-Reliable Seasonal Trades"", most of those strategy may not work due to structural / seasonal change, but the logic behind is solid.Therefore, reader should find a way to understanding seasonal change and use breakout to capture the seasonal trend.Overall, some strategies may be outdated but the logic behind is tradeable. (i.e. in terms of profit, nowaday, it may not worth 5 stars. It has no fancy chart, no complicated formulas, but the idea behind this book (and author first book) is over 5 stars)."
2,seasonal trade,"This is a second books of Mega-seasonal trades. Most of the trades are repeated or updated based on the first book. Money management is the only new topic included. If you are not interested in money management, you may just review trades from the first book."
5,A must read!,I only just discovered this author about a week ago and I've now read three of her books. They have all touched me deeply and I am eager to read the next!
2,Not as good as the authors other books,"Didn't finish. I have enjoyed other books by this author, but didn't like this one. I downloaded this after reading ""When you were Older"" which I loved, but I didn't find this book nearly as interesting or as engaging."
5,Beating a Dead Horse,"What a book, read it twice in a row. While the religion is a bit heavy, the story is fantastic, if you like dark stories. This book explores the fringes of madness. It seems to explain borderline personality syndrome quite well. Do not read this book when you are depressed, it is a good trigger. A very good read."
3,A good place to start.,"The book How to Solve a Murder is a good book for those looking for the basics of how homicides are solved. It delves into issues such as witnesses, finger printing, and other evidence collection and analysis processes. Though a bit boreing at times, the presentation, a story form, is well done and the information useful. Not for in-depth study needs."
2,O.K.,"I liked the title, and the cute cover, and the idea behind the book (to walk you through an imaginary murder, from beginning to end). The concept was good, but the actual delivery was not. The text is written in what I thought was a very fragmented type thinking process. The train of thought seemed ""zig-zag"", for lack of a better phrase. It skipped around from one thought or point to another, then would flash sideways, then try to return to what the original story was. The writer probably needed help putting his ideas down on paper in a more interesting way, and in a format that was easier to follow and that held the readers attention. It was hardly intriguing enough to finish, though I did use sheer will power to get to the end."
2,Best sleeping pill I ever had!,"Very elementry and boring. The book spends much of the time jumping from a crime set up in story form to the history of the techniques used to solve this fake crime. About the time you get into a chapter it jumps back to some early crime solving story. In the words of Joe Friday ""Just the facts mam"". Stick to why people bought the book....MODERN crime solving. As you may guess by the price, this is basicly a pamplete not a book...very short!"
5,usefull,"just what a low vision person needs to write, the best contrast, and good space between lines, also good material"
1,TOO LOUD!,"We received this item as a gift and thought a toy that can make bubbles would be pretty cool. It would be cool if: The suctions stayed on the side of the tub, if it wasn't so stinking loud and if it produced better bubbles. The noise on this thing is actually so loud it scares my 2 year old. The buddles are really pathetic - if I could return it I would and just stick to old fashion bubble bath. Waste of money."
1,"Read the reviews and tried it anyway, BAD IDEA","Even though I read the reviews that said this product was not worth the money I tried it anyhow. Everyone was right. It does not create lots of bubbles like it said it would and it is incredibly LOUD. I thought the loudness would only scare the kids, but didn't realize it annoying to parents too. Don't waste your money. I took mine back!"
1,Do not waste your money!,"I AM SURPRISED THIS TOY EVER MADE IT ON THE MARKET! IT IS SO LOUD, YOU CAN'T HERE YOURSELF THINK. I WAS SO STRESSED ABOUT NOT LETTING IT GET SUMERGED ( A BATH TOY???) WE REMOVED IT THE FIRST FEW MINUTES, AND BACK IN THE BOX IT WENT. I FELT BAD FOR MY TWO YEAR OLD WHO WAS SOOO EXCITED WHEN WE BOUGHT IT!"
1,Worst Bath Toy Ever,I bought this for my daughter to make bath time a little more fun.....my mistake! This toy is horrible. It's so loud!! It makes only a few bubbles and the suction cups don't stay in place. It fell off the bath tub the first time we tried it and it hasn't worked ever since. Don't waste your money on this!!
1,What a JOKE!,My husband and I wanted to buy our 8 month old son something neat to play with in the tub. This toy is not worth buying it is so loud my hubby had to yell to talk to me when it was on because I could not hear him. Plus it scared my son he started to cry. I am taking this toy back and I am warning others DO NOT BUY IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY!
1,Do NOT get this toy!!!,"All I can really do is say 'ditto' to the other reviewers. The only thing I'm grateful for is that I removed the toy from the bath before I tried putting our 1 year old boys in the tub. The motor is obnoxiously loud and the suction cups kept the fish out of water for an astounding 30 seconds. As soon as it dropped in the water, it quit working. What kind of bath toy are you not supposed to get wet?!? Don't waste your money!!!"
1,Horrible Bathtoy,"I bought this bathtoy for my 2 year old daughter. This is the lamest toy I have ever purchased. I would not recommend this item at all, please save your money. Toy makes very little if any bubbles. Very loud!!!Very tempermental!!"
1,Should have read the reviews....,"Really a waste... Unfortunatley we threw away the box so can't return it.. Made too much noise, the girls got scared. Really really loud. It's been collecting dust for a while now. don't waste your $$$."
1,not worth the money,"This toy worked for about 5 minutes and has never worked again. I am still not sure exactly what it was supposed to do, but it is useless."
1,Noisy Toy,"This toy is very noisy for a child under 12 mos. Tried it twice in bathtub with him and he was not happy at all. Had to shut it and discard the toy.Regards,Joe"
1,Disapointed :(,"I was very disapointed with this toy. It is suposed to make bubbles and it does not, all it makes is a whole lot of noise. My child used it once, the day we got it and ever since it has just sat in a pile of old unused bath toys. I would not recomend this item to anyone. I rate it a -0"
2,Not impressed,"My daughter is a little over 2 years old and loves things that make bubbles. This toy is incredibly loud, only makes decent bubbles if you put tons of bubble bath in, the suction cups are mediocre, and if she bumps it and knocks it completely underwater, it stops working for several days. I wouldn't recommend it."
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!!,"This is the worst thing I have ever bought for my daughter. It scared her so much that I had a hard time getting her back in the tub for a few weeks. Everytime she sees it now, she says, ""No fishy.""It does not stay suctioned to the tub which doesn't make sense because it says not to submerge it. It is unbearably loud. Worst of all, it doesn't even produce any bubbles.I would not buy this product. You would be better off burning your money and showing your child a scarey movie."
1,Scared my son,"This toy is really loud - enough that it actually scared my 16 month old son. He refused to go near it and started clinging to me. Plus, it barely generates any bubbles."
1,I cannot believe their quality assurance dept let this thru!!,This is the worst bath toy I have ever seen!! It doesn't bubble. There was hardly any air coming out the holes and the knob broke before I could even get it out of the tub!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!
1,Waste of money!,"I bought this toy thinking it was a fun idea...boy was I wrong.The minute I put the batteries in it and started it up, it was LOUD!!! So loud you can't hear yourself think. My son was staring at me wondering what it was and when I placed it in the bath thinking maybe it was just loud cause it needed to be in the water, it sunk!!! Then it stopped working.I'm amazed to see so many parents who had the same experiences as me. I am also amazed this toy remains on the market. I wasted my money...don't waste yours!!!"
5,Dinah Washington CD,I have had the lp for years. It is an amazing cd ..duets with Brooke Benton as well. Decided to get the cd and the transaction was quick! Thanks.
4,"Not long enough, but...","Kind of a no-nonsense, bare-bones hits package, including her biggest hit, ""What A Diff'rence A Day Makes,"" along with similarly swank, pop-oriented material such as ""Unforgettable,"" ""Baby, You've Got What It Takes"" and ""Baby, Get Lost."" Sure, there's plenty more Dinah Washington worth checking out, but for a quick, inexpensive look at her best known stuff, this overview of her later years is pretty darn efficient."
1,Inaudible Dinah Washington,"I just ordered this CD and it came promptly in the mail and that's the best I can say about it. I would love it if I could hear Dinah Washington. I can hear some songs but the ones, What a Difference a Day Makes and Unforgettable, are unhearable, if that's a word, which I know it's not. Who ever mixed this put backup singers in front and Dinah Washington must be out in the alley. Sometimes there is just silence or a barely audible voice singing, which could be anyone. I am so disappointed."
3,You get what you pay for.,"The item functions as needed. Not a bad product. The knee cups on the exterior are made of a hard plastic, not cushioned rubber like others. Can't say, ""Pleased"", nor ""displeased"". It works."
2,These work but become uncomfortable to wear quickly,I bought these to wear while gardening because I have landscaping rocks I need to kneel down on. They do a great job at protecting my knees but if I don't tighten the straps tightly enough the pads come down eventually. If I do tighten them enough to prevent the pads from coming down the straps bunch up and pinch the back of my leg uncomfortably. I think these would have been better if they had had larger straps at the back. I'm going to use a foam kneeler from now on instead.
5,Hard-Nosed Introduction to Practical Catholic Ethics,"I should stress, at the outset, that I am not a Catholic and that I find many of the arguments in this volume mistaken. Nonetheless, the book is absolutely invaluable in thinking about everyday morality, in that it presents, in clear and easily comprehensible form and language, principled solutions to genuine everyday moral problems. Fr. Grisez is not one of your guitar-strumming priests; he does not try to fudge or obscure. If he believes that a given line of conduct is a sin (or, as he puts it, ""grave matter""), he says so openly and unequivocally. Even where you may disagree, his arguments are so strong that they force you to think about your own position much more deeply. I have learned an enormous amount from this book, and I recommend it warmly to anyone interested in practical morality."
1,not as pictured,"The shirt is nothing more than a white t-shirt with a Steelers applique haphazardly sewn onto it. The one I received looked positively deformed - the logo was not a circle but ""blob""-shaped - poor craftsmanship. Very disappointing."
4,compact atlas,"This atlas is slim and lightweight compared to other atlases, making it easy to pickup to look something up. The maps are clear and easy to read. Each of the maps in the world map section have scales of elevation and distance printed next to them. A great bargain..."
4,Educated guess.,"Since I have yet to read this book, I am just guessing,or actually hoping that this book will live up to my expectations. Based on the quality of the books in this series, I would say that ""4 Stars"" is a safe bet for this book."
5,Why Goodkind is better than Jordan.....,"Ok..there are certain reasons that Terry Goodkind has Robert Jordan in the fantasy writng industry these days. One: Goodkind introduces actual feelings and emotions which mix greatly with the magic and fantasy elements. I had never read fantasy before and Goodkind grabbed my attention like no other author could. Two:Goodkind started the story nice and simple so that it could be easy to follow, I tried to read the first Wheel of Time book and found myself looking to the glossary in the back {yes a glossary for a book )often. You shouldn't need a glossary to read a story. Finally my opinion here folks. Mr. Goodkind's books, i think cater to the first time and not so often fantasy reader. Not to the legions of dweebs, nerds, role-players, and other assorted weirdos out there. Most of these hard core fantasy nuts feel contempt towards Mr. Goodkind because he wants regular people to read his work and not just those of the pocket protector class."
2,BOOK IN THE FIRE,"THE FIRST TWO BOOKS HOOKED ME BUT THE LAST THREE ARE LIKE A SWORD THRUST IN THE BACK. GOODKIND IS A GIFTED WRITER BUT I DONT THINK EVEN HE KNOWS WERE THIS SERIES IS GOING. SOUL OF THE FIRE LEFT ME FEELING BETRAYED FOR A THIRD TIME. GOODKIND SHOULD DO US AND HIMSELF A FAVOR AND NOT PUBLISH HIS NEXT BOOK UNTIL GETS HIS PLOT STRAIGHTENED OUT. ALSO I AM GETTING TIRED OF RICHARD GOING FROM SUPREME MASTER TO WHIPPING BOY. IF HE CANT DO MAJIC THAN TEACH HIM. QUIT FLIP FLOPING HIM FROM MASTER TO NOVICE. I HAVE DECIDED TO GIVE FAITH OF THE FALLEN A CHANCE WHEN IT IS PUBLISHED, I HOPE GOODKIND REGAINS HIS FORM OR I WILL BE ONE OF THE FALLEN."
4,still moving,How do you spend 4 books developing great characters and then not use them? Goodkinds skills at developing characters quickly are great...spending more time developing new characters and letting the main characters become one demesional and stale is a weakness though. It is a trade off that without the books would be much longer though so it is understandable. I still love this series and will continue to read it!
3,I hope the next book is better.,"I enjoy this series greatly, however I thought this book was not as vivid and exciting as the others. It seems like they confront and solve their problems too easily."
3,Soul of the fire review,The product took a month to arrive. It had no jacket cover and the cover had a little damage but the book itself is readable. I didn't read when I ordered it that it was missing the jacket cover.
3,Soul of the Fire,"This book was not as interesting as the first four books of the series, I could not put the first four down until I finished them. I do not think enough was focas on the main characters, the author strayed from the main characters and this is what I though made the story interesting."
2,very disappointing,"This was one of the best series of books I have ever read. . .except for this book. It seemed like about a third of this 700+ page book was taken up with the two ""main"" characters bickering in a meadow (and i quote main because i'm not really sure who the main characters were in this book).The plot was pointless, I (and all my friends) could care less about Fitch or Beata. They were irrelevant. Terry, where were all the characters we all wanted to read about? I hope you are not simply filling space with ""braid tugging"" as the not so great Robert Jordan is doing in his ""Wheel of Time"" series.I see this book as a very poor edition to a very remarkable series. Hope the next one is better, if not he has lost a very avid fan!"
2,What the ^&*((*&% happened??,"In the beginning the introduction of new characters seemed refreshing but as the story line dragged on I became less and less interested in the characters and there seemingly useless contributions to the storyline. Really, most of the whole Ander/Haken storyline seemed monotonous and unnecessarily. Unless this somehow seriously contributes significantly to the next book I really will be disappointed. For the first time I found myself skimming and skipping to keep from falling asleep."
2,Excellent writing but May not be worth your time.,"A well written book that does not add depth to the main characters. You can skip this book if you want to find out what Richard, Kahlan, Zed, Cara and the rest have been up to. If you just want to read Terry Goodkind, then you will enjoy it, but you will feel empty once you have finished. I may or may not buy the next book, I feel that I just paid for a sidebar in a great series. I and all the rest who enjoyed the first four parts were not given a continuaton of a great saga, just a book to fulfill a contractual obligation. After finishing, I re-read the first four to make sure I had not deluded myself into thinking that Terry Goodkind was a great writer. I only hope that, along with Robert Jordan, he doesn't extend this stroyline beyond its natural conclusion just to keep the series going."
5,Soul of Fire (sword of thruth Bk. 5,"I've read all five in this series and anxiously await #6! Passed on the first Book to my 22 yr old son and his new wife (amazinly enough!) they were at my door within a few days asking for the remainder. Anybook that can make me laugh out loud is amazing, any book that can make me cry is something to be treasured, these book are to be saved for reading again and again !"
1,Among the worst fantasy I've ever read...,"Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth series started with more fire and imagination than it's continued with. Story lines are often rehashed varieties of the same ever increasingly dangerous plot, and Soul of Fire is no different. One eventually wonders how the author never thought to himself ""wow, this is incredibly boring and repetitious, I should scrap it all and start over."" The plot is so paper thin that the reader can easily guess how the story will end. I would recommend the book only if you're a desperate fantasy reader and have extensively read (and re-read) your current collection and need something else to read, regardless of how stultifying you might find it."
3,R. Jordan should sue...,"I give this book four stars because, as I wait for the next installments in Robert Jordan and George R. Martin, the Goodkind series has been welcome filler. And I must admit, the story is interesting, though I wish for dark things to happen to Kahlan so the dialogue that makes me feel like I've been dipped in Molasses will stop. And Richard is so goody-goody he's simply not believable; I wish for dark things to happen to him also. But above all, my jaw drops as each element is introduced, cribbed straight out of Jordan. To set forth the evidence would require more space than is allowed here, and I think you all know what I mean anyway. I know imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but Jordan hasn't even finished his series yet! Still, it's a decent read. Given the paucity of good fantasy on the market, I would even have to say that Goodkind is one of the best currently available. Worth reading, after you're caught up on Martin and Jordan."
2,If your following the series. I guess you'll have to read it,"I found that the build up of the characters in Anderith were sort-of pointless because they just died or just gave up hope. Though it was interesting to find about they're lives, it just lacked humour, action and deeper/sinister thought. That relates to the chimes aswell. The build up of the chimes being a horror etc, was dissapointing. The idea of Kahlan being pregnant will the chimes being existent could've been elaborated, but..... Overall, the book was interesting to read. But not as good as 'Wizard's first rule' or 'Stone of tears'"
2,A Let-Down,"Unfortunately, this book does not compare to the rest of this great series. After being blown away by the intensity of books 2-4, this seemed a bit pointless. The plot seemed to be thrown together from one line at the end of book four. I love the characters in this series...maybe in book six we'll get to see them again! Richard without his sword for the entire novel? PLEASE, I wish I had waited for the paperback. That being said, it's still a fine series and I will get book six."
3,"very slow, ending was forced","It was disappointing to read this mediocre book from such a great author. Please Mr.Goodkind, do not go the route of Robert Jordan, slow long books that really go nowhere. I enjoyed your previous books so much. Richard and Kahlan are great characters, however in Soul of the Fire they seemed almost brainless. I implore you not to drag this next book along so slow, and then hurry up and end it. Your action writing is great and i missed it terribly in this book. Your character description is great, Jagang is a terrifying presence, even in this book."
4,I LIKED THE BOOK,EVEN THOUGH I LIKED THE BOOK I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED BUT FOR ALL THESE PEOPLE TO SAY THEY DID NOT LIKE IT IS SILLY FOR THEY GOT SO DETAILED IN WHAT THEY THOUGHT WAS WRONG WITH IT. ITS OBVIOUS THEY WHERE EXCITED BY THE BOOK OR THEY WOULD NOT HAVE REMEMBERED SO MUCH OF WHAT THEY CALLED TRIVIAL.I MYSELF CANT WAIT FOR #6 THANKS TERRY FOR ELEVATING MY IMAGINATION.
3,Soul of the Fire,"Though I agree with ,what seems the majority of, the readers that this was kind of a disapointment I read it eagerly, wondering how all of it would come into play in the next book. I have impatiently awaited each book after the third, when I caught up to Terry Goodkind. I'm sure I will enjoy the upcoming book and remain an immence fan of his books and the characters in them. Terry Goodkind is very skilled at getting his readers involved in his writinhg. Never before have I laughed, cried, and literally sat on the edge of my seat, while reading a series! I strongly recommend the Sword of Truth series to all fantasie readers."
3,"More of Richard, Kahlan and the big pig sticker","This book seemed to drag. More action and a lot of weird stuff going on. As the series progresses, the popularity of the series gives the editor less license to edit/cut page consuming description. I suggest that the editor needs to use the red pencil more."
3,SOT series #5,I am hooked on the series and look forward to next books but this one is kind of hard to get through. They seem to be chasing a lot of rabbits and reviewing what we already know for people who have never read the series. Get to the point! I hope the next is better.
2,too much talk and not enough action,"I have really enjoyed Goodkind's books until now. The first 4 were exciting, had good character development, and plot. In the Soul of the Fire I felt like I was reading a completely different author. The plot seemed shallow and the characters were not the same people we have gotten to know and love or hate. Kahlen was constantly doubting Richard's feelings and ideas, and then they would talk about it for about half a chapter, then they would finally go and do something. By that time -after the talking about it and reasoning what they would do was not very exciting. We did not see the strength that we saw in Kahlen the first 4 books, nor did we see the same sweet and brave Richard. Cara, the mordsith, was the best character in this book. She was developed very well. I certainly don't think I could produce a book as well as Terry Goodkind, but compared to his last few books it was kind of a let down."
2,Sorry,"Alright, i retract my original opinion of the sword of truth, i reviewed the book ""Wizards first Rule"" as a wonderful book and an required read, well that was five books ago, and the plot,or anything at all, has changed from the original book, the sword of truth series ""came in like a lion and out like a lamb"" this lat book was so weak and tired, i havent finished it, i have simply put it onj my bookshelf, and hope that maybe a couple of months later i might have enough motivation to finish the damn thing, i got too bored of the series."
3,Throw-Away,"By the end of the series 5th book, it's obvious that Mr. Goodkind is just as tired of his characters as readers should be. With about 650 pages of buildup followed by 3 pages of resolution, I was left more than a little dissatisfied with the pat-ending, it more resembled an acute case of librus interruptus! I've enjoyed the series immensely to this point and hope this is the only throw-away book in the series. I had a sneaking suspicion when he went off the dark tangent of introducing the new characters that the story was not going to advance the main plot in the least and was coldly satisfied to see it play out so. I'm sure readers will be able to pick up number 6 after reading number 4 with little difficulty. Mr. Goodkind is capable of delivering the best misogynistic high-fantasy out there; here's hoping number 6 reverts to his innovative and absorbing style and not to more stretching this gravy-train out longer than post-Thanksgiving turkey surprises."
2,Sleeper,"Transitional or not, this book was slow and boring. The first four were excellent! Must have been a push to meet a contractual novel clause cause it just doesn't stand up!"
2,This book was VERY disappointing,"What a shame! The first 4 books in this series were excellent, Soul of the Fire was not. Who cares about Anderith? This book did not get going until chapter 52 and I certainly hope book 6 is much much better than this. This series is by far the best in publication, I would hate to see this book bring down the rest of the series. Book 6 needs to be dramatically better."
2,Not worth the wait,A great disappointment compared to the last four books. Seem to me T.G. has spent more time on the marketing plan for his books than on putting thought into writing them. It's a great story and deserves better.
4,GREAT BOOK! Goodkind really outdid hinself this time!,"What a great book. It is second in the series only to the first, Wizard's First Rule. I do not want to spoil the series, but i would recommend you read all of the books and in order. The Soul of the Fire is a great ending to the series, maybe. The book had a rather slow beginning, but being himself, Goodkind could not have a had a better ending! This book deserved the four stars I give it!"
3,Disappointing versus the previous volumes in the series.,"I found this disappointing versus the previous books in the series. It starts well, but bogs down in the middle with too much talk, some of which is even repetitive. The end ties up lots of things in just a few pages. There was plenty of potential for spending less time meandering in the middle and using that time to add drama and color to the end."
1,crap.,"This fifth book in Goodkind's series is crap. Nothing more. Hmm... let's see... could it be a rehashed story written only to make some money and tide over fans until he feels like writing a real book? I would have to say yes. The same storytelling ability Goodkind has demonstrated in the past is still there, but that's about it. The main characters that were developed through 4 books are practically missing from this fifth. TG: I got your point, but you didn't need 500+ pages to make it. Perhaps make your point, then tell some more of the story? Oh, wait, but then you couldn't make as much money..."
2,I CANT WAIT UNTIL REAL SWORD OF TRUTH NOVEL APPEARS,"I'VE BEEN DUPED! THE COVER SAID ""A SWORD OF TRUTH"" NOVEL BUT, INSIDE I FIND THAT THE STORY FOCUSES ON CHARACTERS THAT AREN'T RELEVANT TO THE SERIES. THESE CHAPTERS FELT LIKE FILLER, NOW I HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER TWO YEARS FOR THE NEXT ONE. IS IT JUST ME OR IS ANYONE ELSE READY TO SEE A CONFRONTATION BETWEEN RICHARD AND JAGANG. I HOPE THE NEXT ONE IS ACTUALLY ABOUT RICHARD AND CO."
2,READ THIS; ITS FROM A BITTER PATRON,"do not get me wrong, i thought goodkinds books were good.... but he totally ripped off robert jordan. seeing as how robert jordan was published first, terry goodkind took the same idea and watered it down. take the names for example...richard, and rand? hello. these books scream rip off. no one can beat robert jordan. his books are by far superior. TERRY GOODKIND IS A RIP OFF!!!! HE STOLE HIS MATERIAL!! if you want to e0mail me and discuss this further, please do- i would like to see a good defense set up for terry the cheat goodkind. fletcherama@yahoo.com"
2,What happened to this great writer.....,"I mean, why on earth did he write this fifth novel? I gave it two stars becouse it lacked everything that made The Sword of Truth a great story. Why would he write about people who have no impact on the story at all? And what is it with the sex thing? When I first read the readers reviews I thought that it was just an American thing to be so shocked by the sex in the novels of Terry Goodkind but they are right. There is absolutely no reason to write the things he wrote in the fifth novel. I will wait until the sixth novel and I will definetely read it because I totally loved the first couple of books (book 1 was far out the greatest) but when this sixth novel is just as bad as the last one, I will quit reading this series before it will change my view on the Sword of Truth story. Please take some more time to develope the end and please don't give me any chicken-who-is-not-a-chicken stories anymore Mr. Goodkind....Camiel Lentjes the Netherlands"
2,a dissapointing read,"This series started out so good it's a shame to see it sink to the level it has with this book. I think Terry Goodkind has finally lost the plot and is doing a Robert Jordan on us. Wandering all over the countryside, and putting elaboration in for the sake of it.This book could do with some serious editing. I would have liked to see a tighter story, that progressed the plot more than one millimeter.This is the last book I will be reading in this series, it seems never ending."
2,If...,"If you can ignore the 300 to 400 middle pages, this book is OK. I felt the beginning and the ending were fair and served to illustrate the struggle Richard is going to have convincing people his cause is just. Cool. The extensive descriptions: detail of the city and the characters in it was a complete waste of time and space. I do not need to know the eating habits of characters who I will not see again, or would care to if I could. I could justify it as trying to give the reader a detailed look at a ""average"" city, but it was waaaayyyy too long. The advice I gave my friend who read this book, ""read it if you really want to keep up with some story plot, but skim or skip as much of the city detail as possible and don't expect too much."""
2,Blah!,"The First 3 books of this series were very good. I thoroughly enjoyed the 1st especially. With the fourth, however, there was pretty strong indication that the following works could be sliding. Unfortunately that was the case with Soul of the Fire. I was truly hoping never to hear about the ""Mud People"" again. But we get 100+ pages about the ""Chicken that's not a chicken"". Kahlan is becoming very high maintenance - what happened to the testical eating babe we came to love in Book One?! And what happened to the Gar and the Dragon; I have an idea, bring them back to wipe out the Mud people!...Well anyway, I'm going to bite on Book 6...I just hope the Mud People are completely and utterly destroyed for all time by the Order."
4,great storty,These books tell a great story the only issue i have run into is the massive amount of back story i dont really need a paragraph refresher for every reference.
2,I only put up with this to get to the next book,"I can't belive it; usually Terry Goodkind is on the mark with his punctuation, but not this time. I haven't seen punctuation that bad since I was in high school. It was even hard to follow this book sometimes, but I did my bestThe story itself is interesting.Whatever editing company he uses REALLY dropped the ball this time. I can't totally blame them though, he bears part of the blame for letting it get printed after he read that CRAP.I am about to read something else, then come back and read his book Faith of the fallen (because I already own it) I hope the punctuation is better.I am very dissapoined with this book."
1,Soul of Fire gets doused.,"The concept for this book is one of those that probably looked great when he was outlining it. But hundreds of pages about some fledging kingdom did not interest me considering the previous four SOT novels. But I soldiered through hoping for some payoff in the end. What I got was robbed,ripped off and cheated.If you are hoping this kingdom plays a future role in the fate of the D'Haran Empire? Don't :(If you are hoping Richard finds some clever way to defeat or dispel the Chimes. Don't :(If you are hoping Richard has some awesome battle with a powerful wizard. Don't :(The ending was such a paste-on that I'm left wondering who really wrote it.At the end of the day, you can skip this book and miss very little in plot advancement. That's the real tragedy of it all."
3,not what i expected,I have read all the other sword of truth books and i loved them. However they were much better then Soul of the Fire. The over-all plot was good but i just didnt like the parts including the Minister and his advisor because i thought they were very bording and could have had much more action. but i would still highly recommend that you read this book befor moving to the next ones.
3,"Get ON with it, will you?","WHY YOU SHOULD READ THIS:If you're enthralled with the Truth sequence, go ahead and read this book. It satisfyingly extends some of the characters and one might find revisiting them refreshing. As scifiguys noted, though, do not expect serious advancement in the sequence. Do not go out of your way to buy this book in hardcover. Save it for some sort of ""rainy day"" when nothing better is going on and you're looking for reasons not to clean the house.WHY YOU SHOULD PASS:You want something more than a new episode in a soap opera? Then pass. If nudity, sex, violence, and Murphy's Law realized in several coincidental cruelties across hundreds of pages are not, by themselves, going to do it for you, then definitely pass. Goodkind, despite imaginitive flaws, still has plenty of that to offer.READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM"
1,Very VERY disapointing,"I really like the previous four books, so when this one came out I was really excited. Then I started it. This was the first of the books that I had to struggle to finish. It was completly boring. Iread this a while ago so I don't remember all the details, but I remember as I was reading it being completely fed up with hearing about the Chimes. I DIDN'T CARE what they were doing because he didn't make it interesting. I would recomened the other four books to anyone who likes fantasy but unless you really want to I'd SKIP this book. I just got the sixth one and hopefully that will be better...if it has a lot to do with this one I take back the thing about not reading it but..."
2,What happened to this series?,"First of all, I am a fan of the author and was (until now) enjoying this series. This book really let me down. It was lacking in all the elements that made the previous books good. It wasn't enough to turn me off of the series completely, but it was close."
3,It's okay,"Possible spoilers below:To me it seemed as if the author wanted to write a book about these haken and anders folks, and as an after-thought, tried to figure out a way to plug in this book into the SOT series.I trudged my way through this book in the series mainly to get to the next one.While reading the book, and now afterward, I really don't care about any of the people in that large city/town.And Richard saying he's done with it all? I agree that it's so far out of char that it's a cheap gimmick by the writer to end with a cliff hanger.The writer does have a tendency to drone on and on and I often feel his any one book in the series I've read (this one included) could be several hundred pages less and still portrayed the same story he wanted to tell.Tony!"
4,"Good book, Bad fans","I really enjoyed the book. Albiet it wasn't the best he's written it was still a good book. It kept me engrossed till the end and left me wanting the next book to come out, which is exactly what a book should do. What i didn't like was checking out these reviews and seeing all these people knocking Goodkind. There was no way in hell he could have kept every one of his books going as strong as the first four were. First of all it's not possible, second if it was it would be boring cuz the last thing i want to read is a series of nothing but sword-play and magic. One other thing that gets me is the fact that people could so blatantly insult the man's hard work. Writing books is what he does best and if you think you can outdo him then let's see it."
2,QUITE A DISAPPOINTMENT,"Although I really liked the other books in this series I was really disappointed in this one. It is not often that I consider not finishing a book, but it certainly happened here.Also, what is the huge obsession with sex in this book? Do we really need to know these kinds of things to read this? I usually read a different type of book if I want to know about peoples sex lives."
2,The book starts good then it fizzles out.,"Oh boy was I dissappointed. Are we sure that the same author actually wrote this book? The first few chapters are written in the manner that we are used to seeing, and then all of a sudden your asleep. Word of Advice, don't purchase the book, check it out of your local library and save yourself $25.00."
2,This book was not on par with the other four books.,"I am dissappointed. The author spent to much time and effort developing characters I did not care about. The series has been about a number of main characters. Those characters,while present in the story, really do not progress or develop to any significant degree. The underlying story does not move at all. The Midlands are still at war with the Imperial Order and nothing really happened. Jagang makes a brief, meaningless appearance.I did like the fact the magic dissappeared. It was creative. Magic still had to be addressed but in a different light.In short this appears to be a book written soley to meet a deadline and pick-up a check. Before I buy the next book, I will wait for the paperback."
3,Not really worth the wait,"This long awaited installment to the Sword of Truth series seems to have fallen short of expectations. Goodkind makes many small mistakes, in descriptions of events that have occured in previous books. It almost seems as though a different author wrote the book. In Temple of the Winds he seems to promise an intersting development between, Chandalan and Cara, as well as Ann and Nathan, then leaves Nathan out of the story completly while leaving Cara and Chandalan acting as complete strangers.It is decent addition the series fleshing out an interesting world, but not quite up to par with Goodkinds previous books."
3,This book falls short.,"I felt that this book fell short of Goodkind's previous books in the series.Nothing much happened, and there didn't seem to be the same struggle for victory as in the previous books, there was always some great hurdle to bypass to allow victory. This time, Richard just goes to where he is needed, and happens to think of the answer.Also, in the previous books, Richard was never left without hope, he never fully gave up, but this time it ends with him calling it quits. It feels like Goodkind stopped the story in the middle. I hope Terry returns to what made his story great in his next book in the series."
5,An exciting collection to own.,"Terry Goodkind captured me in the very first book I read. They are so exciting and adveturious that you have a hard time to put them down. I have all four of the books in the set and have now orderd the fifth in the series and can't wait to recieve it and get started reading.If you want a real adventure, purchase this set,for it is a great collection."
4,Another great book!,"I've read all five of the Sword of Truth novels. All were excellent fantasy novels, with engrossing characters, and intelligent stories. This is not the best of the series, (that's Wizards First Rule), but this addition left me with the same longing for the next in the series. Many authors face the challenge of retelling the struggle between good and evil. Goodkind succeeds with style. His novels, like many others, are great reads."
2,TWO WORDS: WHAT HAPPENED?,"In ToW, and indeed, all of the SoT books, the reading has been intense, but also had a restraining sense of steady progression that made the book ""feel"" real. Now, in Soul of the Fire, Goodkind rushes through the events with the haste of a high-schooler writing his first piece. Then, what irks me most of all is that he has given his characters (and readers) what they want most: happiness. An in the space 500 short pages, he snatches it away. I, for one, am totally and utterly disappointed, and hope that Mr. Goodkind will make an effort to amend his mistakes in future installments."
2,It wasn't that good,"Here's the bottom line. Goodkind didn't have the same influence on this book as he did on Wizard's First Rule and Stone of Tears. Goodkind might be losing his touch as some authors will, occasionally. I just hope his next book will be better than Soul of the Fire. His first two were awesome. He just needs to stop putting in his own political ideas and just move the story along."
3,"doesn't hold a candle to Tad Williams, Robert Jordan et al.","Terry Goodkind posess obvious talent in terms of his prose. The scenes in all of the Sword of Truth books are vivid, descriptive, and well written. This book is an entertaining read. However, Goodkind seems to have neither the ability nor inclination to write a true epic fantasy series, and he would be better suited to write shorter more adventure styled novels. The Sword of Truth series lacks a main thread. Secondary characters and plotlines are picked up and discarded at will (Nathan Rahl, Chase, the Keeper, the dragon, among countless others). There is no unifying history throughout the stories and magic seems at times ubiquitous and at times pathetic. If you want a book to read on the beach, take Soul of the Fire. If you want high quality epic fantasy that makes you think, read Tad Williams or George R. R. Martin, authors to which Goodkind cannot compare."
3,Ayn Rand for people who only read fantasy novels,"Terry Goodkind is clearly trying to model himself after Ayn Rand. But it's Ayn Rand-lite with respect to everything good about Ayn Rand (philosophy), and Ayn Rand on steroids with respect to everything bad about Ayn Rand (long speeches and unrealistic dialog, absurd political situations).Goodkind attempts to bludgeon us with the message of The Fountainhead over and over again. Those with talent are hated because of it. There are zillions of Ellsworth Toohey characters running around, and the average regular person is easily duped by them. Richard Rahl/Howard Roark/Dagny Taggart tries to explain to the people the truth, but they are too stupid to see the truth.There's also a fantasy story in here somewhere, but that's only about 25% of the novel.The writing style is way too juvenile to take any of the watered-down objectivism stuff seriously. So why do I bother to keep reading Goodkind's books? As some other reviewer said, it's inertia."
4,another good book,this is a very good SOT novel. If you read this book you will enjoy the whole thing. Though i must say the ending was not as strong as it could have been but it is still a very good book. If you have never read one of these books i urge you to start from the begining or you will be lost. All in all a very good book
1,Disturbingly bad.,The morbid sense of curiosity that I have propelled me to continue reading this series. This hurt to read.
1,Terry Goodkind can't write.,Terry Goodkind can not write and it boggles my mind that he accumulated such a following. He by no means competes with the greats of Robert Jordan (RIP) and George RR Martin... I bought this book when I had no other option at the airport... and returned it upon landing. I would have rather enjoyed my time with the Twilight series... and I suffered through the Twilight books so I could have a leg upon which to stand when I said they were AWFUL. I don't suppose many educated people enjoy Terry Goodkind... they seem like fantasy for the illiterate or juvenile.
1,The Emperor Has No Clothes!,"This book was awful. It was not a deep dissertation on the human spirit, or complex human conditions, or anything else. It was 100 pages of Richard chasing a chicken-monster, 50 pages of recap from previous books and about 250 pages of Kahlan pouting and whining. Oh, and Richard finding out he has yet another woman who thinks she's married to him, something that occurs in each book and has become a source of great merriment among Goodkind's former fans. What started off with some promise in Wizard's First Rule has fizzled into a boring, endless, pointless episodic melodrama which even the author admits has no plan for a conclusion. Stop the Madness! We've all made Terry Goodkind very rich, and this is how he rewards us? I'm insulted."
5,"""well I thought it was masterful and had great emotion""",well I thought it was a masterful tale that had great emotion and shows to me what true fantasy is about i've read all the foodkind books so far(exept legends) and have loved all of them but Goodkind still comes at us with more stunning story the more he writes the more amaginative he gets and the better he gets......
5,You're going to love it!!!!,"Ok, I'll be brief. I got my hands on a reader copy of SotF a couple weeks ago and I plowed through it. You're not going to believe some of the stuff that happens. As to wether the two lovebirds get any peace or not, well depends on the kind of peace you're talking about. Watch out for Anderith. If anybody wants to hear more gory details email me and your questions will be answered :-)"
4,"Goodkind is good, Jordan is good. Stop comparing.","I love fantasy. I have read The Wheel of time 5 times. I have also read the sword of truth twice. Goodkind was refreshing with his new style of magic, but still followed basic guidelines. Yes, he expanded on the old guidelines, but didn't stray far. Jordan had a completely new style of Magic that I personally have never seen the equal of before or since. I enjoy reading both authors, consider them both at the top of the list of great authors. But please. Don't put either one down while praising the other. if you have any respect for fantasy fiction, you will know that with THESE authors, it would be almost impossible to place one above the other."
3,"These books are pretty good, but not that good.","This is really in response to all of you nuts who keep saying that Goodkind is better than Jordan: Shut up. Goodkind's books are excellent, but they are rather simplistic and can get boring. Jordan on the other hand, writes greatly involved, very detailed books, which can also get boring. The difference is, one has more detail, thus better describes the setting/characters, thus is better. And to the guy who said goodkind shows more emotion: you're wrong. Goodkind expresses basic ideas over and over, while Jordan introdcues character development, and other good stuff. Plus, his characters act logically. So, I say again: shut up."
4,unfairly disparaged,"This installment in the Wizard's First Rule series is taking a bit too much of a beating from some of the reviewers. It's true that the book diverges off the mainstream of the plot from the first four books, but it's a pretty interesting digression. In the fifth book, most of the action takes place in Ander, and the bulk of the book is only loosely tied to our main heroes, Richard and company. Nevertheless, the political machinations and the social structure of Ander were really compelling reading. If anything, I'd say book five returned to some original thinking (which was hugely in evidence in the first book, despite some opinions that it was derivative of Jordan's series). I think books three and four dragged badly, but Soul of Fire is a worthy installment in the series. If you're new to Goodkind, start with book 1 --Wizard's First Rule -- which is wonderful. Don't expect too much from the subsequent books, which are merely okay."
1,forgetable,the pages not spent re-hashing the previous books were used to repeat actions done by the characters in them
2,A 'little' story lost and in search of an end...,"Terry Goodkind takes a major detour into the realms of parochial politics and loses his way. In 'Soul of Fire', Goodkind attempts to recreate something of the charm of earlier instalments, but fails because he does not have a story to tell. The plot evaporates about half way through and he spends most of the second half desperately seeking an end, which unfortunately does not come soon enough. I was left bewildered by the sudden conclusion. Is it really so necessary to link this story to the sequel in such an obvious and clumsy manner? Does this book carry the taint of 'contractual obligation'?"
3,The fire lost its spark,"TG's first WFR was great and he had a strong sequal with Stone of Tears as well. Blood of the fold was kind of iffy. TotW was a good read because of high tention and betrayal. Unfortunately where all his previous books actually drove the plot forward Soul of the Fire merely succeded in holding the plot together. The tention that would have been caused by Richard's loss of his sword was squelched by the fact that he never came it to any situations where he REALLY needed it. Also, the book tended to linger on Fitch, who was strong in character but tended to not really make much of a difference in the greater scheme of things. The book wasnt a total loss Terry did a great job writing and the chimes were as bad a foe as Richard has faced. All in all with a little more of the main plot woven into the story it could have been prefect... maybe next time."
3,What happened?,"After reading SotF, I was left with a feeling of longing. A longing to keep on reading. I'm sorry, but after reading WFR, SoT, BotF, and TotW, Terry left a lot out of his fith instalment of the Sowrd of Truth series. I was expecting mabey a confrentation with Jangang, or that mabey he would learn a little about how to use his magic. Or terry would write about the old wizards and tell more about the wars between the old and new worlds. But all in all, it was still Goodkind and I liked it to a certain extent. It had the flare and action and depth like the rest of the books to make it good enough to be called a Sowrd of Truth novel."
1,"Please, no more!","Goodkind has quite an imagination if he can imagine something worse than this. Will these people never die? It's hard to find plots so obvious and characters so wooden in B movies, much less in a book of this length. Here we have a failed attempt to explain away all the inconsistencies of the earlier books, and again, the characters are conveniently either omnipotent or fragile. Make them go away."
2,Terry is running out of gas,"His first and second book were GREAT but they have gone down hill from there. I suggest you start this ride, but get off before the end."
3,exciting as always.but a bit drawn out at times,"As always a thrilling and exciting adventure.For me Terry Goodkind has captured the good and a little of the bad aspects of fantasy writing.At times the story-line was a bit drawn out and focased more on background and past series info,instead of the characters(pity),but im sure book 6 will prove an even more level-headed book.thanks for everything Terry,an enjoyable series."
3,Lack of Courage!,"As someone who is a great fan of Terry Goodkind and Robert Jordan, this book I must say falls short of my expectations. After reading Temple of the Winds I had high expectations for Goodkinds next book. Goodkind starts off weaving an excellent tale, but seems to lose sight of creating an exciting and thrilling ending! So, if you love hearing about a great thunder storm that is supposed to be headed in your direction and being dispointed by light rain then read this book! If you would like to get lost in a story, read ""Wizards First Rule"" or ""Temple of the Winds"" two books deserving of Goodkinds fine name!"
1,Dissapointment too Kind,"After reading through the incredible first in the series, the Wizards First Rule, I quickly ordered all succeeding books including this one. Incredible also describes the way the author has progressively erradicated all elements of the first one which made it so successful to culminate in this last series, whose description as ""page turner"" merely refers to skipping through 50 pages of dull text at a time consisting primarily of meaningless dialogue. One could do better by reading the first 50 and last 50 pages without the disappointment and tediousness of wrestling with all 600+ pages. Alas, I will still have to buy the next one, if only for a reduced 50 pages of good reading."
3,But now you're stuck . . .,"This book introduces a bunch of new characters with long stories which I enjoyed (but others might not) and the story still is progressing, though slowly.If you've already read books 1 - 4 of the SOT series, and you really like them, you're stuck. The characters are lovable enough, and the story is interesting and fun enough that you're still in and you have to stay.But, I warn that the series starts to decline after this book. If you're not totally enthralled by books 1-4, don't bother to read this one."
4,Maybe,"I love Goodkind and he's easily my favorite author, but this book didn't have the magic of the first 4. It was boring the first time I read it though liked it the second time. For those of you thinking of reading this book, or the whole series if you haven't already done so, bear with this book. The first 4 are wonderful and the sixth book is my favorite book of all time. And the seventh book is good too, even though it's quite different. My advice is to read this book even if it does seem rather boring. It's worth the read."
3,The weakest of the series so far,"I recently finished SotF, having been reading the series in order. In short, this one was a big disappointment coming on the heels of Temple of the Winds, which I think was the BEST of the series. There is WAY too much droning on and on about the odious Anders and Zed and Ann's feeble do-nothingness, and the disjointed ending appears to be an acknowledgement by the author that the readers finally need to be put out of their misery.I struggled to finish the book - a problem I never had with any of the other Sword of Truth books. I finished it mostly because I wanted to get to Faith of the Fallen, which my wife assures me is much better (she's how I got hooked on the series). I've started FotF now, and so far, I agree: it is better."
3,The worst of the first five by far.,This is the fifth book in the series and for me by far the weakest of the first five. A lot of time is spent slowly building up to what feels like a rushed ending. It was an OK read but really did not progress the overall story line very far at all. That said I still want to get straight in to book six as I am still keen to see how this part of the overall story line (that was setup at the end of book four) plays out.
1,Bad enough to stop reading the series?,"No other characters have been added in such a long, dry way. How do you stay away from the three main charters for chapters at a time? Our typical characters are not acting like themselves. There is no passion, no intrigue. It is stagnant and I find myself flipping page after page trying to find something worthwhile about it. Am ready to put the book down altogether and either archive them in kindle or try moving to the next book if the next book starts off as bad, I will be done.This book is almost like someone else wrote it.Thoroughly disappointed."
2,Kindle Edition is Missing Content?,"I just purchased this last night & discovered some problems. If you go to the Copyright page (location 45 according to Kindle), at the bottom, there is a section that says: ""eForward to the electronic edition copyright 2011 by Terry Goodkind c/o Revel Studios, Inc."" In my copy, there is no eForward by Terry Goodkind, nor is the entry from Kolo's Journal (which appears in the print version of the book before the beginning of chapter 1, which I borrowed from my local library) included in the eBook.EDIT: I have sent eMails explaining the problem to Mr. Goodkind's people & they so far have not answered. The only thing I can get from Amazon is that they will look into the matter. I am not the only fan of this series to notice this missing content. I am still waiting for the issue to be fixed."
1,First book of the series I had to force myself to get through.,I've invested so much time and energy into these characters to have half of this book filled with the intricacies of another lands political system. The characters of this other land take up so much time and I found them uninteresting and just plain lame. I loved the parts with Richard and Kahlan but the reason I gave this one star is because I felt as I was being punished for liking them. A really great chapter followed by 4 or 6 chapters of drab story that might of well of been another book.
3,Beware of Chicken-thing!,"I agree with a lot of the reviews for this book: The Haken/Ander subplot is boring as hell. I can't stand politics, and this book is all about politics. But I love the first few chapters of the book. They were as hilarious as they were terrifying. And boy was I happy when Fitch died, that annoying little bastard."
1,"Much worse then the first four, WHAT HAPPENED?","Soul of the Fire was an incredibly plodding and slow book. It doesn't start out necessarily badly, but once it starts with all the Fitch nonsense, you wonder ""Why is this in the story?"" The first four, WFR, SOT, BOTF, and TOTW were good and well written. This one was a large step down. If you are going to read it, get it in paperback, it's not worth the money for the hardcover."
3,The best is yet to come,"Fellow T.G. fans please understand that Goodkind is actualy the GOOD kind of writer. All this seemingly boreing stories and unimportant characters (who mostly just died) will probably have some big role in the next book. Everything (I hope) will fall into place in book 6, maybe this was just a side novel to set up a great story for #6. Terry, if you read this, you're the best out there, as far as i'm concerned."
4,Phsycological synopsis,"Okay I was sort of angry and dissappointed at T.G.'s latest book. I think that *all* the other books were very good and exciting, but this book made it seem like he was reading the reviews too much and only focusing on what is considered exciting and popular for readers today, basically mindless dribble. It was better than many books I've read lately but I just expected more from Terry. I was also dissapointed when more of the Mord Sith didn't come into the story, they were in the ending of the last book. The beginning was pretty good but it basically went down hill from there, maybe Goodkind had sometype of traumitizing event in his life, we can only hope. But I will be reading the next book that comes out."
2,Ho Hum.,"This series grabbed me and hooked me good right from the start. That being said, wow! What a let down. I will continue to read this series but I really think the next book needs to pick it up a bit.In 'Soul of the Fire' we spend time getting to know new characters which could have been great.TG really can bring characters into the story in a masterful way. You want to cheer for them. The problem in this book is that all of them are basically discarded like they were never important anyway. So I end up wondering why did we spend half the book on things that didn't matter anyway. Maybe I am missing the point that these are examples of the futility of the Ander people in general or something but I was left wanting more.I started reading the series because of the magic involved. This book had little to none and I was disappointed.Right now I feel very much like TG is getting lessons from Robert Jordan.Ho, hum."
3,Lacks the depth and intensity of the previous books,"I just finished reading this book. I have to say I am a little disappointed. The story seems flat and rather one-dimensional. Many of the characters to which the author devotes so much time seem rather incidental to the full story. It is almost as if someone else wrote the book. It's still worth the read, but it's not as good as the first books in this series."
3,"Well, in for a penny...","I found this book to bea good read, a bit dry, but all in all, very decent. It was refreshing to hear about topics other than war (although a bit more action couldn't have hurt). The Haken/Ander history was intriguing, although some characters were overused, i.e, Fitch. I'm eagerly awaiting the release of the sixth book. Hopefully, there will be a ""Duel of the Fates"" in which it comes down to one on one with Jagang and Richard (I can't beleive he gave up!). That's another thing; why on earth did Richard give up? was it to give an excuse to re-incorperate Chase and co.? Hopefully, Kahlan or Cara will talk Richard into getting it together. For those of you who rated the book 5 stars, well, it's not that great. For those of you who rated it 1 star, reconsider, at least until the sixth installment comes out."
4,"Good addition to series, but not the best of the series","I love this series, but I was somewhat disappointed by this latest installment. I am eager for the next in the series and will buy it immediately upon release. Terry left the climax to almost the very last few pages, and seemed to summarily wrap it up. I had to re-read the last part of the book several times to truely understand what was implied for resolution. I find most of Terry's work very gratifying in the detail of atonement, this ending was rushed. I still give it a 4 star due to the rest of the series, but alone this book would not merit this rating. I do actively recommend the series, and can't wait for the next book."
2,Better luck next time,"I am a great fan of this series, unfortunately I didn't like this book as much as the others. I would have like a better developement on Richard with is new found powers. When I finished his previous book, I thought that in the next, he is going to find Zedd and will be able to control his power now, that's gonna be cool. Nope, they found Zedd, talk to him for a day (nothing relevant) and then they're off walking...for about a month or so. Why don't they invent car or something, it seems to me that they are doing a lot of walking lately. We do have a wonderful introduction to the Haken and Ander people...I DON'T CARE! I didn't buy this book for a story on someone who's getting a disease by a prostitute of all this. If your like me though, you won't listen to what I say and your gonna by this book, and the one after simply because your a fan."
4,Terry's stepping stone,"I believe that this book is slow, but I agree with some of the other reviewers. This book is a stepping stone into the next. yes, it was slow in some areas, but his style is still ""Terry"". His next book should by enlighting. I don't agree with most of the reviewers, he is still one of the best authors i have ever read, and I have quite the library, all of which is fantasy. I say, ""keep the faith"", he is not done with Richard,Kahlan,Cara,etc. Mr.Goodkind, if you read this, may I ask one favor? please include Zedd more. I miss his humor."
4,Enjoyable..,"Reading a lot of the reviews before actually diving into the book I thought I was going to be disappointed. I'm not. While this may not be the Sword of Truth novel many were looking for, I for one, still found it a good read. I liked Fith and I enjoyed all the information on Anderith and the culture there. I found myself caring for the Hakens and I was flipping the pages anxiously waiting to see what would happen next to Fith and Beata. A little more Zedd would've been nice, but there's always the next book. Not to give it away but after learning more about the Chimes and how they operate I didn't find the ""chicken monster"" section all that hard to believe. Overall I liked the book a lot.."
4,A delightful entrance into a war yet to come.,"Fantastic reality thrown into the saga of Richard and Kahlan has certainly created a new begining. As new characters were introduced and dissected, it was easy to become friends with them and even relate to their obvious evil intentions -- as if they were for a greater purpose. I truly believe that a lot of readers are missing the big picture here. This is one tale that pulls the entire story back on track and perhaps creates the setting for a much longer story.This was the best in the series to date, solely because of the change of pace and the anticipation of whats to come."
1,What the heck happened?,"Goodkind really screwed up. The end was really, really rushed. It seemed like he was getting bored and so decided to skip a whole bunch of important stuff. Fitch and Beata were useless and served no point in the story. All the political manuevering just distracted from the real story- the Chimes. I did not care about the Minister of Culture- I want to know about the chimes! Zedd kinda was gone, but the scene where he vanished was superb. The whole end was stupid. Richard ""quits"". Stupid. Is he ending it here? Cara couldn't stop two boys? Stupid. All the sexual content? Stupid, unnecessary. It was also boring. It left too many loose ends... Read some Jordan and enjoy an excellent fantasy."
1,Terry's tired,"It's clear that the passion Terry Goodkind had in the first few books of the series has dissipated. The fun stuff, the clever stuff, is gone, replaced by the rantings of a sour disposition. It's really sad when an author doesn't know when to stop. It's time to bring the series to a head--go after Jagang--and then see if there is anything left to write. This book was boring and it took the story completely off course."
3,A disappointment,"This latest book seemed to do hardly nothing for the existing story line of the series, and only developed new characters which did relatively nothing but add length to the book. Also, the book ends extremely fast, and leaves way to many loose ends. Overall, the book wasn't on near the same level as those before, and I was rather disappointed by the story, and it's conclusion."
1,Goodkind took two years to write this?!,"I must say that the Sword of Truth series is one of the best I have read. However, Soul of the Fire was just horrible; over half of the book was devoted to a developing a new group of characters who were boring and really had no effect on the ongoing storyline and it felt like he just threw in the returning characters to say it was a Sword of Truth book. My opinion, read the first four, skip this one (just find someone to tell you a Cliff's Notes version) and wait patiently for the next."
1,I can't recommend you purchase this disappointment.,The series seems to be getting darker and darker in tone. The main characters have become petty and lacking in the spark present in varying degrees in the four previous volumes of the series.
2,Very Disappointed,The Soul of Fire was a major disappointment. The returning characters had absoultely no new development. More pages were devoted to new characters who ended up to have no significance. Kahlan was nothing more than a nagging and jealous wife. Hardly any pages were from Richard's perspective. I kept hoping it would get better as I read along but it didn't. Even the end was a disappointment.
3,Not up to Par,I have to admit that ever since I happened to pick up Stone of Tears in an airport I've hungered for these books. I could hardly contain myself as publication day drew near for Soul of the Fire. I was in for a disappointment however. Half of the book is spent on characters that were anything but sympathetic and as far as I can tell just served to illustrate the impact of ignorance and power mongering. There wasn't nearly enough of the casual interaction among characters that I so loved in the other books. Soul of the Fire lacked the same sense of urgency that the other stories had and this instalment seemed to do very little to advance the overall storyline of the series. I guess I'll just have to wait a year or so for the next book and hope for the best (which is what I've come to expect from Mr. Goodkind).
2,The magic is fading,"While Richard battles to restore magic to the world of life, Goodkind battles to restore magic to his writing. I am not entirely sorry I started the series -- yet."
2,"A page-turner, NOT!","I had to remind myself to keep pressing through this book. I was not challenged at all by this book. It is words on paper. I like the series, but what was this? The whole book was invalidated by the next in the series. Goodkind spends an entire book building up a civilization and several new characters then abandons the whole group by the end of the story.What was the point?The book picks up at the end.I found this story bland, uneventful, and dissapointing."
3,"Good, but a notch behind rest of series","Having just finished Robert Jordan's latest, which I avoided for awhile due to the bad reviews, and having been horrified at the meandering pace and pointless novel, I was a little afraid to go back to this series, too. I originally thought the Sword was a more traditional, not as enriching series, but Robert Jordan has sure begun to get annoying as the series meanders and the characters do often incomprehensible things that seem to relate only to male-bashing. This latest Sword episode is also a step back from the quality of the rest of the series, but on ly a small step, unlike Jordan's fiasco. I still enjoyed all of this book, and in fact, I wanted it to continue longer. my only complaint is that very little of the plot lines were resolved. It is very much an ""interim"" book.I will say one more thing: these guys need to resolve these series SOON."
3,Expected better,"Let me say this is one great series and T Goodkind is a terrific writer,but this episode dragged too much on side characters for me. I want Richard and Kahlan to dominate book and they didn't. Also i found dialog between Richard and Kahlan a little sophmoric at times. Jeez he is the Seeker of Truth so why ever doubt the guy. It was a nice read, but I expected a little more action . Also Zedd should be around more, hes so cool and funny. Hope next ones a bit better."
3,The book was good but the ending was not.,"I found this book ok, there was a lot of explaning and it just wasn't all that interesting. There forth book, Temple of Winds was excellent. I think that should have been the end of The Sword of Truth series and Mr. Terry Goodkind should start a new series of novel. I mean, the Soul of the fire was just so, plain. It didn't really draw you into the novel like the other four before it. It was indeed not one of his best work, he's a great author and all but the ending of the soul of fire, it was like he was in a rush to finsh it or something."
1,AWFUL! RIDICULOUS EVEN,"Despite the obvious ""ripoff"" nature of this series I enjoyed reading the first four books. But this book was TERRIBLE. Goodkind totally lost his focus when he wrote this book. Somehow the characters have changed completely and we are suppose to accept it. I have no idea who the RICHARD or KAHLAN are in this book. They lack all that made them interesting and fun to read about.I gave this book every chance possible, but I couldn't even finish it. After about 400 pages I was so tired of trying to like the book that stopped reading it completely. It is clear that this series has hit a dead end. If I could give this book a rating of 0 stars I would have. I feel sorry for all those faithful Goodkind readers out there that ponied up the dough for the hardcover.P.s. I didn't find the ""tongue in cheek"" humor in this book at all! If anything the book is RIDICULOUS!"
4,One of the better,"While my husband and I have different feelings about this chapter in the soap opera saga of Richard and his wife, I found this instalment to be one of the more enjoyable reads."
2,Doesn't stand on it's own.,"Soul of the Fire the 5'th in a great series is a bit of a let down. The chracters have become too emotional. Richard would work better as a darker character with a bit more of a sence of humor instead, we get him crying all the time. Of course we don't put up with much of this because the main characters are hadly in the book. Instead we get chapter after boring chapter on new lifeless , dull characters who end up being irrelevent. I felt all most cheated by this book. It doesn't answer any of the questions we have from the last book and takes us into all these new people we'll never see again. It's only worth reading in hopes that the next one will be better and since the last one was so well done."
2,Two books too far,If people purchased this book thinking it would be about Richard and Kahlan I'm sure they were as disappointed as I was. The preceeding book was just poorly written but this one is almost a deception. I think the motive here was to see how far they could stretch the series. I'm very disappointed in Mr. Goodkind. The first three books in this series were among the best I have ever read.
3,A Little Less Soul in this Fire,"Temple of the Winds was my favorite book of the series, so I was really pumped when I began this book.I have the impression TG was rushing this book. The whole chicken thing fiasco was ridiculous to say the least. The character depth was not there, and the characters' responses were inconsistent with both their personalties and the previous books. The villains were flatter than normal (exception - Dalton), I never got the impression that anyone was in mortal danger, and the overall plot did not progress. The climax of the book was rushed, and I felt unrewarded.The Goodkind parts - When Fitch was first introduced, I thought we might be getting a glimpse of the next Seeker, I was into it and enjoyed the twist. The other thing I enjoyed was the way Dalton took care of business at the end. That left my jaw hanging.My faith has not fallen - book 6 will come back strong. Despite the flaws, if you are reading the series don't stop! You will be rewarded."
2,Few refreshing moments don't compensate for repetition,"It took me three months to read this book. It was a trial getting past the sappy first two chapters after that things picked up. As is the authors trademark we had the pointless rape-du-jour that does nothing to advance the plot, we have a few grimly detailed mugings to round out the bit-o-ultraviolence too. The method by which Richard bansihes the chimes comes completely out of left field. Not enough of the favorite secondary characters like the Mud People, Mord Sith bondage babes or even smelly old Gratch. The final ending left openings for another book naturally but was tied up too neatly."
2,Seemed like Mr. Goodkind himself is tired of this series.,"I was very impressed with the previous Sword of Truth Books, I loved the conflict between Kahlan and Richard and the conflicts within themselves. The ideas were new and the storyline complex enough to leave me pondering. However, Soul of the Fire (where did this title come from?) was a major disappointment. Chicken monsters? CHICKEN MONSTERS??? Where were our heroes? We spent a goodly time learning about corrupt politics in Anderith while we followed the antics of an unintelligent slave boy who has no character and regularly engages in gratitous violence. I felt that the book ended without any closure...Richard was never told that his soul belonged to the chimes and Zedd never found out about Du'Chaillu, Richards 'other' wife. I truly felt that Mr. Goodkind himself was tired of his characters, and perhaps tired of his genre all together."
4,Master Thon: Thou Hast Been Wrong!!,"I Have Read ALL Books Of ""The Sword Of Truth,"" And Find Thy Remarks About Goodkind's Latest, ""Soul Of The Fire,"" As Well As Things Said In The Past.Some Claim That Book 5 Was A Poor Quality For A Goodkind Novel. Have You Ever Tried To Write A BooK? Book 5 Is What Is Known As A Transition Novel: Meant To Carry The Current Story Line To The Proper Place To Raise The Level Of That Story Line. There Will Be A Book 6, No Doubt, And I Feel That It Will Be The Most Quickly Intensifying A Book Could Ever Be. Just Wait.Goodkind Is A Great Writer, And Shall Not Abandon Such A Great Story.-Master Ignasyo Thon, First God Of Realms"
5,Just the best!!!!!,I have just finished reading all four Sword of Truth books for the second time in preperation for book number five. Any one who wants to be swept away into a world of magic should read these books. Terry Goodkind has lots of strong women in his books and shows that some times women can have courage in the face of evil. Can't wait till the end of the month to get his new book and sit down and spend the time to read another exciting chapter in the life of Richard and Kahlan.
1,"I'd give this zero stars, if I could.","I enjoyed all the Sword of Truth books prior to this one, and the Faith of the Fallen was a remarkable comeback. Soul of Fire lost me as soon as the Killer Chicken showed up. I only finished it because my sister assured me it got better after that. She lied.Do yourself a favor, and don't waste your time. I agree with the reviewers who suggest skipping straight to Faith of the Fallen."
2,"Starts good, ends bad!","This book started out with an interesting new cast of characters and culture that made me hopefull that Goodkind was going to change it up a little. Unfortunately there is way too much in depth analysis of what people are eating or wearing and a lack of substance to the story. All the new characters end up (after 600 pages of reading) being irrelevant and a basic waste of time. The main character Richard then pulls some unexplained magic trick out of his [...] and saves the day,just like every other book in the series so far. I hate to stop the series after this many volumes, but ""tired"" is about the best way I can describe this series."
4,Very good book,"While reading the first book of the series, ""Wizard's First Rule"" I couldn't help but notice that their were many similarities between that book and Robert Jordan's WOT series. This book I thought really broke away from the WOT series, and I enjoyed all the plotting from the different characters. What I did not like about the book was all of the Republican ideology put in the book. If Mr. Goodkind could concentrate more on the characters in the book and less on the ideology in this world he could be a fantastic writer. Overall though very good book, and I can't wait to read the next one"
3,Kind a liked it.,"Granted, it led the reader into a new direction. Away from Richard and Kahlan but it also tied the entire series together. We now know what is the next pivital event that must take place in order to save the free people."
1,Could it get any worse?,"I've followed this series from the first book. And from the first book I knew what to expect from a Sword of Truth book: an awkward, overwritten, unlikely yarn with flat characters, tired themes, and hackneyed magic. Other than that, I could expect a pretty good story. The one thing I never expected was dull. Soul of fire achieves dull."
1,New Goodkind book thin to the point of non-existance,"The fifth volume of the Sword of Truth series is so thin, I can't even see it. I have been able to ascertain no plot development, no action, and - strangest of all - no copying of the Wheel of Time series whatsoever. In fact, now that I think about it, I haven't even read it. I couldn't. It's not published yet, you see. Still, just like everyone else, I thought a review would be well appreciated."
2,What happened?,The sword of truth started out great (book 1 was awesome). But unfortunately it has all been downhill from here... I couldn't even froce myself to finish this book. Martin has become too obsessed with pointless sexual violence and has strayed too far away from the plot. Read Wizard's 1st Rule. Stop there.
3,"Unlike most of you, I've actually READ this book","Soul of the Fire is a good read. It's not as good as Wizard's First Rule or Stone of Tears; it's better than Temple of the Winds and Blood of the Fold [but then, anything would be.] It has some interesting surprises. There is way too much ""catch up"" material and references to things that happened in the earlier books. Bill and Hillary Clinton probably will be very upset to see themselves mocked out in a fantasy novel.I think Goodkind is running out of steam with these characters, but not necessarily the world. If he would concentrate on some of the other aspects of the story, and get off of Richard and Kahlan for a while, it would be worth it. Kahlan is becoming even more jealous and whiney, and Richard is growing more and more cardboard by the day. [How many woman can one man marry, for cripe's sake?] I say this as a fan who wants to see the series continue, but not like this. And even after 508 pages I STILL have no idea what SOUL OF THE FIRE means."
4,good but bad,"Richard finally realizes the secrets of the universe, only to lose it in a bargain. What a disapointment. He should stumble into a book of secrets, learn what power really is, and destroy the world. That would be great. Hopefully book five will swing this way...as for the rest of the series: so far so good..."
3,Need better maps!,"What kind of a fantasy series has such cruddy maps? When I read the first book, I had to laugh at the map there: two vertical lines of bumpy mountains with plains in the middle. Boooring! Finally, by the fourth book, terry finally added a couple more terrain features, thank God! Overall, despite the map problems, these are enjoyable books, even though he keeps wasting time on poorly-written sappy stuff. And the fourth book was a waste. Did you realize, it didn't advance the plot AT ALL?? In some ways, I wish I'd never started reading this stuff, cuz now I'm stuck. I HAVE to find out what's happening. Please, finish the series already!!!"
2,Blaaaah!!!,I think the book doesn't take you anywhere..... It's just a little event in the line of time.... It shouldn't take a whole book to write about it.
1,Character development=Incessant Bickering...,"Dear Mr. Goodkind: PLEASE stop reading Jordan. Character development is NOT merely describing tedious arguements between the reluctant hero and those who STILL dont believe him when he says that the sky is falling. I enjoyed the earlier SOT novels, but it is really getting creepy how this is all turning into Wheel Of Time Lite."
5,the book was a social commentary,"Am I the only one who noticed the commentary on conditions in the US by the events and people of Anderith? Bertrand Chinboor and his wife seemed to me to be characters much like Mr and Mrs Clinton. The whole idea throughout the book of not being able to trust a liar, of the manipulation of the population of Anderith for selfish gain, the sanctity of life as we watched Kahlan struggle with whether to keep her baby, and the efforts of many in Anderith, along with the hordes of the Emperor Jagang to destroy magic seemed to me a fascinating and refreshing story, putting things and people in position for what is to come, but also making a statement. I was enthralled with the book."
2,Fade to Black,This book really disappointed me. No depth and no continuation. His first books have all taken a slight turn for the boring. I hope his last picks it up again. :-)Hopeful fan...
3,really 2.5 stars...,"Aside from the last sixty or so pages of the book I wasn't even sure that I was reading a Goodkind novel. It was not so much that the story line changed so, THAT I thought could be interesting but turned out to go no where. It was more that the book was very very flat. The characters seemed wooden, dull, the dialog boring. I almost gave up on the book, but the last part did make for enjoyable reading.Books 1,2 & 4 are excellent. This one I could have done with out. But I will read 6 if there is one. Terry did set the stage for what could be an interesting story and a new departure... ."
3,Not all that bad but the end seemed an imploded soufflé...,"I like Mr Goodkind's SotF, though it is not as strong as his earlier books. I felt somewhat let down at the 'grand finale'. The series might just as well end here ... not even a hint for a sequel this time. Should he decide to write a sequel though, I fervently hope he recovers the spark that characterized his earlier books."
1,very very disappointed,"Who the hell cares about some stupid ignorant people like Fitch, Dalton, Franca, Teresa, etc... The real fans want to know about Richard, Zedd, Ann, Nathan, and even Jagang, but we don't get any of that here. This book stinks! I really wished I would have waited to check it out from the library, instead of putting my money into Mr. G's pocket! I agree with the fans that say that Mr. G has gone the way of Jordan and is only dragging his series on to make money. And isn't it about time for Zedd to teach Richard something about his gift instead of lying to him and sending him off on some false erand like as if he was a little baby. Please Mr. G don't do this to your fans."
3,3 stars is a bit much isn't it?,"Oh why oh why do they always have to have the hardcover out before the soft??? If you're planning on spending the money don't bother - but you might consider borrowing it from a library. I found it remarkably disappointing that this book could have come from such a brilliant writer. But, i still haven't lost faith, i'm hoping for a more than average storyline for book 6. And truly, Mr Goodkind if you read this comment pleease spend a little extra time on the ending - and just ignore your publishers if they have a deadline i'm sure everyone wouldn't mind if you just spent a little extra time making up a good ending!"
4,A good read!,"While violent, certianly not unimaginative. I quite enjoyed this book. The concept was quite interesting and definately a bit different... I liked it overall."
2,Anderith too much of it,"I loved the first four novels. I could not put them down. However with this fifth installement, you have 300 pages of the lives of anderith people. They're not important and they disappear in the 6th novel. There was no need to write so much of their story while the only peopple we care about are nathan, richard, kahlan, zedd, anne, verna and all the magical creatures we met through the first novels. The chimes were a great idea but there was not enough magic in this book.One advice you can fastword on all the chapters concerning Anderith. They add no value to the book. If you do that, you will definitely enjoy the book."
1,What an awful pile of dung !,"I liked the first four books. They were definately gory at times and certainly frustrating but at least they held my attention. The new characters are completely unsympathetic and boring. I can't stand how the old characters never seem to learn from their mistakes. It's like a bad episode of Three's Company. You know the one about the misunderstanding ... TG spends three books convincing us that Kahlin is an intelligent, capable, strong woman who really has her sh-t together and then she is replaced with Lucy Ricardo. I almost crawled out of my skin with the whole Marlin business in the begining of book 4 and don't even get me started about the whole ""Chicken that is not a chicken"" bit. I actually put the book down (something I never do) and I may never finish it."
2,At least they are getting better,"Wizard's first rule was amazing. I stayed up all night reading it because the characters were dear to me, and the plot was simply exciting. However, the sequels that have followed have not had the same edge that the orginal had.But if you fell in love with the characters in the first book, like me, you have HAD to read the sequels to know what happened to those poor souls fighting to save the land from certain destruction. So, you are forced to read this book, as I was, out of curiosity.The good news: I felt this book was quite a lot better than the other sequels. Less twisted violence, and honest plot development. Its not a completle waste of time. But don't buy it in hardback."
3,Not enough of Richard or Kahlan or Zedd and so on and so,"I liked the book. It was excellently written, with an imaginative plot that was complex and well thought out. But where on my favorite characters, Richard and Kahland and Zedd and everyone else. I waited a whole year to read about them, but instead I got a book about Dalton Campbell and Tess Campbell and Fitch and Chanboor. Not that I didn't like them. All of them we very good bad guys, but more than half the book was spent on them, and I didn't wait a year to read about them. I waited a year to read about Richard and co."
4,Could have been better.,"If not for the last 200 pages of this book, I would have given it only 3 stars. Goodkind took the first 500 pages of the book to set up the last 200, which I couldn't put down. This seems a little excessive. It probably could have been done in half of that and still been as effective.As usual, however, Mr. Goodkind's writing is very compelling. Even though most of the book was spent on introducing new characters and a new country in the Midlands, it was still a book that was difficult to put down. I just wish more time had been spent with Richard and Kahlan.One other letdown was that the resolution was pretty quick and not explained very well. I just finished it last night...I may have to go back and re-read that part, just so I can understand it better. Goodkind usually does a better job than that.I am just hoping that the next book is back up to his usual level of excellence."
5,Had To Read It Twice,"Wizard's First Rule was possibly one of the best books I have ever read. I had to read it twice, because the first time went way to fast. I could not put it down. The way Goodkind makes his characters come alive, you could almost head down the street and talk to them. READ THIS BOOK"
3,Maybe Terry should slow down...,"Terry Goodkind seems to be falling into the same trap that Robert Jordan did - albeit not as far. It's a decent book, but it's not the fantastic work that Wizards First Rule was. The plots are seeming more and more contrived - it's always the same formula of the thing saving the world turns out to be some horrible nasty menace in the next book. And the sex is getting kinda overboard, too. I realize the Order is supposed to be evil and horrific, but I think that a less 2-dimensional villian would be better."
3,Not as good as the others...,"The book is well written, as Goodkind's books always are, but I missed the main characters. We have to wait so long between books that I get excited to meet up with the main players again, but this book doesn't use them much. Only at the very end do we get to see everyone again. Good new characters, though."
5,A MUST BUY,"Terry Goodkind has a wonderful, enchanting, earth-shattering fantasy series! BUY THIS BOOK!"
3,"Goodkind is a great writer, but he needs originality","OK all you Goodkind fans, have any of you ever read Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series? Have you ever noticed that Goodkind's Sword of Truth series is so curiously similar that the characters are interchangeable? I agree that Goodkind is a good writer (tho a little warped in some of his sinister characters) but I really wish he'd venture into unchartered original waters."
1,Could we wait just a bit??,Here is a thought. I am a Sword of truth fan and have all the books but I think reviewing the book b/4 u read it is.. how do i put it? STUPID!!!Walk with me thru this logic sequence. Pre-order book. April 13- Get book. April 13 to 16-Read book fervently. Think about book. Review book on Amazon.comAnyone took a look at the Path of Daggers review page b/4 the book was out?? At least 70 reviews all gibbering about how great the book is or is supposed to be. Pre-hype anyone?? Let's wait and see if Terry keeps it real like he should. Anyone think it is about bloody time Richard learnt to control his gift?? just a thot.
5,Go! Goodkind Go!,"SOT series ROCKS!!! I can never imagine how Goodkind comes up with books like that! I have read every single book in the series countless times. Even my friend, who hates all that fantasy stuff is hooked on Goodkind's books. HOW DOES HE DO IT???!!! For all you Jordan fans out there, I read the first chapter of Jordan's ""Wheel of Time"" I can honestly say that it was rather dull, BUT you can never judge a book by its first chapter. From all the reviews I've read, I'm sure that Jordan's books are pretty interesting. No matter what, SOT series will always be my favorite books. =)"
3,Questioning,"I have so far, read each of Terry Goodkinds works. And I have found them to be entertaining. His writing cannot be described as genuinely creative. There are plenty of outside influences that can be seen in his writing. There are indeed gaps in his writing and in the worlds that he has developed. However, if we are going to pull every work of fiction apart and examine it from cover to cover under a microscope than I guess it would be better to read a biology text. I read fantasy because it is fun and care free. I enjoy a well-told story and can avoid getting caught up in needing too many details, yet Goodkind spins an excellent and very entertaining tale. His books are well worth the time to read. I have not yet received ""Soul of the Fire"" but look forward to reading it."
5,Goodkind is a genuine marvel!,"I have been hungrily devouring Goodkind's novels since they came out (and am even rereading them for the third time) He manages to capture a depth of emotion and character that is rarely found in other books of the genre. I can hardly wait to see how Soul of the Fire holds out, and am expecting it to be better than the rest!"
5,One of the greatest books written,Terry Goodkind is the master of fantasy. I was captivated by the adventures of his charactors and am anxiously awating the sequel. Over all his sword of truth series is compelling and I recomend anyone who has not read this series to read it.
2,worst book in the series,"I have to say I have been stedily getting more dissapointed in this series. I had hoped he would wrap it up in 3-4 books, but like 'the eye of time' series it is dragging on and on and on. Very little progress really seems to have been made by the end of this book and I doubt I'll be buying more in this series. All in all a dissapointment."
4,Very good book a page turner,Goodkind's new book Soul of the Fire is like his previous Sword of Truth series. There are some slow parts in the middle of the book but they are nessessary to the plot and it will all come together in the end. He has created a real page turner and in the process left the reader wanting for more. The character's are well thought out and very detailed it make the reader feel like he is part of the story line.
2,Doesn't work. Either should the author... anymore.,"The first thing you notice is the seemingly gradeschool-esque tone of the book. The first half of the book is essentially, ""See Richard run"", ""See Kahlan jump"", ""Oooh, spooky chickens"". And how poor the transition between feelings... ""And so, Zedd cried!.. Then he was happy!.. now mystified,, alas, he cries again.."" Gime a break. The book rambles endlessly on, seemingly with no true regard for the existing storyline. What a terrible book..."
2,Who wrote this book?,"Richard gave up. A whole book where Richard doesn't fight. We here about a bunch of people who die in the end for 350 pages of the 500 page book. But hey now that Kahlan lost her baby boy I guess they can have another child without fear of it being like that, even if it is a boy it's not the one shota had the bad dreams about.I didn't like this one it was to much about stratigy. I liked it when there was action and now the only reason I put up with it is cause I want to know what happens to Richard and Kahlan. Richard GAVE UP. Does he even read his own books??? I read a review for the fourth book, I don't know if it was really him but it was here in amazon and it said author review and in it he said something along the lines of people who didn't like his book being dumb, and that the temple was his best book. I disagree and so do most the people who reviewed it. Don't take offense like that just fix it!"
4,Well written book to set up an even better one in the future,"Terry Goodkind has once again shown his mastery in the realm of Fantasy. I think that Soul of Fire was a little slow, but that Goodkind does a marvelous job in setting up the forthcoming volume. My only negative critisim has to do with the lack of information on Chase, Gratch, etc. BUT, I do think that they will come into play in the next book. All I can say is that anyone who enjoys fantasy would love this series and that I'm impatiently waiting on the next...and the next...and the next..."
1,Book not yet received,"We did not yet receive this book, although we ordered it end of May.We still hope to receive the book after all."
3,Not sure what to think about this,"This book, while well written and fairly solid, has a little bit of a strange story line to it. The three chimes are funky to say the least, but if nothing else, at least we know the author has a good imagination and can come up with some whacky things to keep a story building, growing, and expanding."
1,"Really There is not Much to say but, Terrible","This is one of the worst books I have ever read. I really liked the first one. The second one was a little bit childish, but I could live with it. The third was great! The 4th book was bad, slow and boring.This book amplified and expanded on all that was wrong with the 4th book.Half the book is about new characters who die at the end in very lame and anti-clamic ways. It makes you say, ""what the %&* did these people have to do with the story at all?""Really you could read a one page summary of the book and you would get all you need out of it and then you could move on to something better, in fact I don't think I have read a worse book. Skip this one if you want to read the series, very likely it will make you abandon the whole series if you read it anyway."
3,A big disappointment,"I greatly anticipated the release of the 5th book of The Sword of Truth series only to find myself let down. It took me about a week to finish. The novel itself is great, but lacks the qualities that made the rest of his books a success. In the beginning, Goodkind repeatedly includes paragraphs detailing characters and events. I felt that this made the beginning of the book extremely boring. Goodkind seemed to get off track in this novel. He left out many important characters and developed many others that were insignificant and a waste in my opinion. In the end the conclusion was pathetically written and very brief. Goddkind tells briefly about how Richard solves the problems of the chimes and left me felling empty. There was little to no magic use and talk in the entire novel which made me all the more unfulfilled. Overall, the book was decent. I hope that the next novel will be a little more thought out and not drift into so much detail."
3,something you can read,"I guess the main problem lies with the fact that there is lesser mysteries and intrigue dealing with the story. there are no more mysterious places or obscure prophecies. no big surprises, but if you ask me, it is quite a good continuation. But I agree that certain characters are very dready like Fitch and all the people in Anderith- quite whimpy lot. it is good that he has brought back the Baka Man people after such a long time. What has happened to Nathan, Adie, Verna,Warren and all? Their stories would interest me more, like what mysteries is Nathan hunting down, etc? Hope to have all these answered in the next book."
2,I had to stop reading,"After reading about 150 pages of this book, I just had to quit. Terry Goodkind seems to have fallen into the same trap that has snared writers like Robert Jordan. He seems to have decided to keep the series opened ended and just kick out as many Sword of Truth novels as he can. The focused story that was present in Goodkind's earilier works is no longer there. This book is just something to bridge the way to books six, seven, and eight. The writing itself is not bad, but much like the Wheel of Time series, the Sword of Truth series is picking up a lot of dead weight. We see an ever multiplying cast of characters and the story itself just gets bigger and no end is in sight. I will waste no more time on this series. I like stories that have an ending."
5,Soul of the Fire,"All of the books from Terry Goodkind's series including the Soul of the Fire are captivating, spell bond books that once you finish one of his books you want to read the next one. We are in the process of buying the hard bond books to re-read these books over and over. If you enjoy action and adventure this series will full fill those needs and more."
3,"Solid story, but weakest of the series","Soul of the Fire takes much longer to get into than the rest of the Sword of Truth series. The plot is more in depth, and the extensive background information on newly introduced characters is overwhelming at times, especially when considering the outcome. The book does pick up near the end, although I couldn't help but feel that the climax was rather rushed after the lengthy build up. Overall, it was an enjoyable enough read, and I would recommend it to anyone who is familiar with the series. To those who haven't read previous novels in the series, start at the beginning (Wizard's First Rule) before picking up this book."
2,Meandering babble,"I've thoroughly enjoyed this series but this, the 5th in the series, was a mess for me. I had a very hard time making my way through it. It meanders all over the place for almost 500 pages and then in the last 17 pages he ties everything up quickly in a neat little bow."
2,I've read this somewhere!,"The Edgar Rice Burroughs style is growing tiresome. The main characters being cut off from either one another or thier power is the plot line of each of these books after the first. I found myself skipping through this book in a way that reminded me of why I stopped reading Stephen King. Goodkind keeps making references to the first books and explaining them as if any of us would start reading a fantasy novel at the 5th book. I know my fantasy brothers well enough to know that it's book one or nothing.....anything else would leave you confused. Kahlan is starting to get so tetchy that I'm begining to wish she actually did get her head cut off.(see I know I don't have to explain that sentence, because if your reading this review I know you've probably already read the book I'm refering to) I'm giving book six a chance anyway and if I'm still dissapointed then I'm through with Goodkind..."
5,New installment to the SOW series is the best ever!,"I have almost finished this phenomenal piece of literature and I must say that it continues in the tradtion of quality in all of Goodkind's novels. To those of you who say that his books are no good, and that he takes his ideas from the Wheel of Time series, you a wrong. I am an avid fan of Jordan, and I fell that he and Goodkind are at a par. Once again SOTF is great, and I hope the 6th book is as good."
3,"Okay, but not quite up to the standard of the other books.","I have read all of the books through multiple times, and im not to sure i want to read this one again. I was first hooked onto the SoT series because i found it different from others by not explaining the characters' attitudes and thoughts, like most do.But now with the fifth book, he explains to much in the begining.I didnt really feel anything exciting about it i was over three-fourths done( somewhere between page 425 and 500).It also confused me the way it ended.It is a book worth reading, if u truly like the series, but dont waste $30 on the hardcover.It aint worth it.A series i found to be up with that of SoT is the Wheel of Time.I strongley suggest you read it."
2,Wait for the paperback version,"While still a good read, Soul of the Fire isn't in the same league as the first four SoT books. Nothing really happens for the first 400 pages or so and the ending is decidedly anti-climactic. I wish I'd waited for the paperback. Now I have to wait another year to two years for Mr. Jordan's and Mr. Goodkind's new books to come out. Even though I was sorely disappointed with the last book in both of their series, I know I'll buy their next books in hardback too. I hope I don't regret it again."
2,This book was a mojor dissapointment for readers.,I think the first two books of the series were the best. I thought Blood of the fold was O.K...and Temple of the Winds was not too bad. But this book was terrible. The book had no action in it. I found myself flipping ahead as I read through the pages looking for an intersting part to read but never found one. And what confuses me is that the Series name is named after an object that only appears once throughout the whole novel. This was a major dissapointment indeed. I surely hope Goodkind is not running out of ideas because I think he is one of the most talented fantasy writers I know about.
3,Question...,"Is it just me, or do Kahlan and Richard seem to be growing apart from each other, cuz it seems to me that they use to be more in love than they seem now, and richard seems to be obsessed with his job as seeker and more so as Master Rahl, that he has no time for the ones he says he loves. And, it I would think it more exciting if Richard actually learned to use the gift instead of always being sent away from Zedd or Nathan. I dunno, have not finished the book, but doesn;t seem to have a great story line so far, too many new characters coming at me to quickly, and am having trouble telling who is who, other than the main characters thats about it |BV| Capt. Rahl (CO)"
1,"Hopefully, this series has breathed its last...","Clearly Goodkind feels he has run out of Robert Jordan's material to re-write. The first 4 books in the Sword of Truth series lacked any original thoughts or ideas, but it would be difficult to blame the convoluted and messy plot in Soul of the Fire on anyone but Goodkind. My suggestion is that he use the Sword of Truth to hack apart any further notes or manuscripts dealing with this series."
1,Worst book in the series,"The book started slow, ended abruptly, I skipped most of it. Jordan's latest book is much better than Terry's one. And Jordan's latest book was mediocre. What's happening to major fantasy writers, are they getting too big for their own good, no editors? Terry I used to love reading your books, almost as much as Jordans, now I will buy paperback. This was one of the worst books I ever read, and I have read plenty of fantasy, from Jordan, to Eddings, to Salvator, to Terry Brooks etc. This book was about a killer chicken, how laughable, and characters who had nothing to do with the story! Three chimes indeed."
3,"No Comparison to book one and two, two being my favorite.","From the very beginning this book dragged. why did it take the first 200 pages of the book for Richard and Kahlan to figure out the Chimes were loose. The whole next 100 pages about the political activitites of Anderith were even more boring and to end it with so many un-answered questions was extremely Jordan style writting. I have come to know Goodkind is a much better writter than this. It is so obvious were this story line is going. I don't know what Jagang will do to Zedd but it will be extreme to get Richard to return from Westland to finally battle and triumph over him. Whatever was done to Cara while there was no magic will be Richards weekness. After such a long absence from Adyndril, the newly arrived Mordsith will seek him out in Westland to assist him in his battle with the Sisters of the Dark. Come on Terry you can do better than this."
2,Not up to the standard set by previous books,"I was disappointed in the Soul of the Fire. I very much enjoyed the first two books in this series (Wizard's First Rule and Stone of Tears), which were characterized by imagination, interesting plots, and attention to detail. The second two books, while very entertaining, seemed hurried and lacked the depth and level of detail that I found appealing in the first two books.Unfortunately, the Soul of the Fire continues this downward tend. The book seems hurried and superficial. Aside from an amusing (though obvious) parallel with recent political scandals and trendy notions, this book just goes through the motions. The ending is particularly dissatisfying, arriving at a momentous change of attitude with insufficient provocation.In summary, fans would be interested, but I would not recommend the book to first time readers."
5,Goodkind doesn't dissapointe,"I have eagerly been anticipating this book for a year. I ordered it a month before it even came out, so you can imagine how exited I was when I received it. I'm glad to say the Terry Goodkind has been able to keep this series interestig. I would have liked to have seen Richard do more with his new found power. I know the story line was about magic failing, but Richard didn't get the Sword of Truth in his hands until the last paragraph. Oh well, I'll impatiently wait for the next book!"
3,A little off,"Quite good, but it does tend to deviate from the main plotline. And my biggest complaint is that the main characters always seem to create their own problems, often through stupid mistakes. Judgement isn't their strong suit shall we say. And as for Jordan vs Goodkind, everything has been said., but personally I'll put my money on Jordan. Really people, its not that hard to keep track of his characters provided you have an I.Q. over 90."
1,This Guy MUST be paid by the word,"An amazing display of filling up the page with obtuse and obvious statements, combined with hyperbole, only to be repeated again and again and again. ""The Mud People had much in common with them..."" and 2 seconds later... they shared the same values..."" and then ""they were very similar in their dedication to protecting their people.."" and nauseatingly detailed description of things that lend nothing to furthering the plot or character development. Clearly someone just going through the motions for a paycheck. Characters so thin ...Sorry if that sounds impolite or overly critical. Only because I am stuck in traffic and currently have nothing better to listen to (although silence is a close second) was I able to finish this disaster."
2,New Direction,"I LOVE this series!! That said this book was a tremendous dissappointment. It seemed like the whole writing style changed, and the way the plot layed out was predictable and boring. While the other books in this series were just as long or longer, I considered them quick reads. I had to struggle with this one. I hope he goes back to the style that got him here. A mixture of extreme action and interesting character development.I will look forward to reading the next book in the series knowing what Goodkind is capable of producing. If not he might want to consider wrapping this storyline up!!!"
2,This book stinks,"This book, even with the progressively worse 3rd and 4th books, was very disapointing. The plot diverts early in the book, and at the end it seems like Richard is exactly where he was at the beginning. I was looking forward to events hinted at in Temple of the Winds, and they didn't happen. Also, I feel the events have disapointing effects on future books about the Midlands. If you have to read it,(book 6 is really good), get it from a library, don't waste money on it."
2,horrible!,"The first novel, Wizards first rule, was an awsome book packed with everything anyone could ask for in a book. As i read on throughout the series...well it seemed the books kept preaching and sometimes goodkind would explain things that went on for pages at a time. And Richards abilities just started to seem a little too much. He seemed to gain a whole lot of abilities like the whole additive subtractive magic a little too fast. I just have plain stopped reading the books it might sound strange but i have lost interest in them. Its the same plot over and over and over. It really let me down."
1,LCD fantasy,"The number of 'reviews' on this page, and the slavering commentary, is really quite hilarious--but it is a mirth spiked with sorrow. Terry GoodKind is LCD fantasy: lowest-common-denominator clap-trap drivel that insults the intelligence but certainly appeals to those that like to read large books (""Wow! 800 pages!"") that in 'truth' do little to challenge the cranium. The SOT world has shallow depth, stolen creativity, and virtually no insight into the complexities of relationships or the historic and mythological details that make up a good world. I would say that the characters come straight from a comic book or sitcom, but I've seen/read far better on puply pages and the 'eternal society screen.' And to those thousands of Goodkind fans reading this, unfurrow that brow and ungrit those teeth: this is just a viewpoint, no more, no less. My only suggestion is to READ the book before cobbling together your love-letters..."
5,Sword Of Truth is BEST of ALL TIME!!!!!,I have read all four Sword of Truth books and they are the best books. You can never get bord and all the rules of the Wizards apply to every day life!Trust me read them!!!
3,makes a nice pillow......,"I found this book the worst of the lot. The first books were incredible, but they are deteriorating at an alarming rate. Its really time that the story starts advancing, I am sick of reading explanations for people who have skipped books. The Books as you all know are finished off far to fast. I always say to myself ""there is no way he can finish off all this plot with 100 pages"" and the story is VERY idle. I am still anxious for the next book because I am full of hope that his story line will get better, The potential for this series is great and I know for a fact that Terry can make it a memorable series.Until then, Have a nice rest...I mean read."
4,Wonderfully insightful CD,"I purchased this CD from Denis. He came into my office in Gainesville, FL and sold it to me! I have had it for at least a year and a half. It gets quite a bit of use. As the other reveiwer stated it is somewhat Dylanesque. But quite different! Spiritually deep. He was a very pleasant gentleman and I enjoyed speaking with him. The music is quite varied, but it is all wonderful."
1,Terrible....,"These three papyrus plants looked as if they'd just sprouted from seed about two days before shipping. They died within two days of planting and for that you charged $19.99! The Elephant's Ears on the same order from Hughes were the same--seedlings with no developed root bulb. Only one of them is still alive. I ordered a papyrus plant from another online nursery and they shipped a full-grown, 1-gallon can plant for $12.95 and about $5.00 for shipping. Too bad Amazon is providing a marketplace for this kind of deceptive selling."
5,The best story of the Green River Killer ever!!!,The other reviewers weren't wrong here. I saw this movie a couple of nights ago and it was the most in depth study of all the hard work and perseverance it took to catch this psychotic maniac who was also a coward killing girls as young as 15. I think people should watch movies like this even if they are adverse to violence to see what kind of sick demented people there are in the world. If they did they would probably take more precautions to make sure they and their loved ones are more secure. The acting in this movie is excellent and the side perspective from one of the victims makes it feel more like it is happening to you. This movie will definitely make you appreciate the hard work our law enforcement officers put in to catch these people. Outstanding!!!
3,The Capture of the Green River Killer,I wish the story hadn't been narrated by one of the victims.It seemed to distract from the investigation which was moreintense than depicted in the movie. The movie was longenough whereas this could have been accomplished.
2,I guess it didnt matter,"To me persoanlly it just seem like this album was just put togehter. Its just boring. I do like "" It Matters To me "" and Am mans Home Is His Castle. But the rest of the cd just does go anywhere with me. Im sorry Faith"
5,A Wonderful Album!,"I recently purchased this CD because I heard how great Faith Hill's second album was. It's wonderful! Each and every one of these amazing songs on here is unique in its own way. ""A Man's Home Is His Castle"" deals with the tough subject of a wife being abused and ""Let's Go To Vegas"" is a very upbeat song. ""Keep Walkin' On"" is a surprisingly fun, fast-paced gospel song, featuring Shelby Lynne. ""I Can't Do That Anymore"" is about a wife being taken advantage of by her husband. Overall, ""It Matters To Me"" is a superb collection of songs that deals with all subjects. A must have for any Faith fan!"
4,Good Country Album,"This album has some sassy songs along with ""It Matters to Me"" and ""I can't do That Anymore,"" which are plaintive and lovely. ""A Man's Home is His Castle"" is a good story song. Basically this album has everything good about country on it."
3,The CD was ok. Faith could have done better.,"The songs I like on this CD: ""Someone eles dream"", ""Let's go to vegas"", It matter to me"", you can't lose me"" and "" I can't do that any more"". Are the songs I like. Faith you can do better than that. I like the song ""Let's make love"" with Tim. It not on this CD it's on Breathe, but I like the song anyways."
3,Condition not quite as advertised,"Book was advertised as being in ""very good"" condition by seller ""BASEBALL8"" . It does not, however, fit that description. The cover is in ragged condition and the pages appear to have been wet. Since most of the text is legible (some highlighting and ink marking), the book is still usable and I did not return it."
4,Good Algebra II/Trig High School Math Book.,"A pretty decent math book, but I only bought it because my school uses it and I wanted an extra copy to keep at home so I didn't have to lug it back and forth w/ 8,000 other books a day. But it is lightweight, thanks to its lack of unnecessary graphics, and according to my math teachers, it's packed with problems, including extra practice. It has a good amount of examples.It also has a few random biographies of mathematicians and scientists that are interesting, but mostly pointless, and have little correlations to the sections. There are also small sections about math careers. Additionally, there are computer exercises for students with programming experience. Answers to odd problems are in the back, which is a major plus. ~A. Brown"
1,Very Unhelpful book,"This book does not explain itself. It does not explain its sample exercises, and I have barely been able to do any of the exercises without googling a more explanatory online source."
1,This Book Is A Hot Mess,"This could well be the worst textbook I've ever seen, in any subject.The text itself is laid out very poorly.Paragraphs seem arbitrary, the typeface is difficult to read and examples/sidebars seem randomly placed.The printstock itself seems nearly onionskin in its thickness making it difficult to note in the margins, highlight, or heaven forbid you need to erase in the book.The concepts are poorly explained with very few step-by-step examples. Even in the student solution guide, the answers make large leaps between steps.I'll be quite happy to resell this book at the end of the semester as any college algebra book + Gelfand & Saul's Trigonometry will help you far, far more than Cohen's book ever will."
1,Overpriced piece of junk,"I was a bit hesitant to buy this and justly so. I've never received a product that was in such bad condition that I had to send it back. The two side panels were completely cracked, the wood was horribly warped and the pegs to put it together with the glue were too small for the holes. I just can't believe that this is going for $100. It is totally not worth it. I could build something myself for way less money with way more quality. Speaking of quality, the manufacturer could use some quality control."
1,Forget it.... Overpriced,Forget it.... over priced ....self assembly....falls apart...even if itwere $29 dollars which it should be ....I would think twice
2,Easy to read but not very useful,"I used to think this book could tell me some ""Strategy"" of how to win this game in different difficulty levels, while this book is not such a book, although to read it is quite relaxable.Almost all the content of this book can be found in the cyclopedia of the game which is very convenient to check when you are playing the game. This is just another vesion of the cyclopedia. The begining part may not be in the cyclopedia, but can mostly be found in the Instruction Manual.SO if you want to know the game but not play it, just buy this book; while if you wanna play it, no need to buy the book."
2,Expanded Instruction Manual - Little Strategy,"I bought this manual hoping to quickly get up to speed with the new game. I knew enough to play at the more basic levels but wanted tips on how to improve my playing level. What I found in this book was a nicely complete instruction manual, and very little in the way of strategies, tips, etc.While I did read the book cover to cover and learned a few rules and features that I was unaware of beforehand, it did little to improve my level of play. This is a very complex game, and knowing a few basic tips/tricks can be immensely helpful. Most of the tricks I've learned came from extensive playing (it's easy to get [pulled] into this game) and message boards online - Yahoo groups, civfanatics, etc.If you have money to burn and want a comprehensive instruction manual buy this book. If you are looking to improve your level of play, you won't find it here."
1,Not very helpful and sometimes misleading,"This strategy guide is not very helpful at all. It contains little useful information, and some incorrect information. For example, it says that one needs 80,000 culture points for a cultural victory when in fact one needs 100,000 points. A buyer has a right to expect that people who write strategy guides will at least know the rules."
2,Not worth the money,"There isn't much in this book to make it worth buying. A few tips, most of which you'd learn on your own after playing one game of Civ3. I consult the manual more than I do this book when playing. Skip this book and use the money to buy caffeinated drinks so you can play Civ3 all night long."
1,complete waste of time,"Some of the earlier guides offered usefull stratagies for the rooky and experienced gamer, this is less usefull that the game maual. Don't waste your money. This has the feel of a book rushed to publication, and plagiarized (not really, it just has that feel) from the rule book. There isn't anything in the way of truly creative strategy to this book and the game deserves a much better guide, especailly since this is the most complex game to date (*****)."
2,Nothing you wouldnt find on the Internet,"I have previously bought guides about other games (AOK, Conquerors) and they were somewhat helpful. This is different. It tells more or less the same than the manual itself and gives you a hint of what technology research according to your playing style (Warmonger, Peaceful, etc).I regret buying it."
2,Knowlegeable Civ players must pass on this,"This guide is only for those people who don't know the difference between a spearman and a warrior, or for those who get eliminated while playing the Chieftain level, which isn't an easy feat.Otherwise, it does the job it's supposed to."
5,rare great live lp,"This album sounds similar to Television's Marquee Moon in that songs appear built around a solid drum foundation (David Robinson). Great songs; subtle, but effective guitar and horns. The inspiration for some of the Cleveland, Ohio sound in the late 70's/early 80's (AMG bio tells you all you need to know). Narrative lyrics with an edge. I wish 70's era music was all this good."
3,affords little scratch protection,"The clip is mimimalistic and elegant in design like the iPod itself, but it affords no protection from scratches from normal everyday activities. The iPod is a scratch magnet. The clip is sturdy, but unless you never brush up against anything, EVER, this is a clip that's begging for iPod damage. Note that this clip only accommodates the 40 GB iPod, not the iPod photo which is physically larger than its monochromatic screen counterpart."
5,Its been a top favorite of mine for years!,"This cd, especially Disc 1, creates the perfect atmosphere for a chilled out environment. It can set the tone for a nice drive in the car or is awesome for creating a mood in the bedroom. A roommate gave it to me in college, and I listened to it so much that I had to buy another copy over the years. Love it!"
1,A poor and disorganic collection,"There are hundreds of cd's like this. Many of them are actually better. It is a poor, very disorganic, useless collection of songs. The idea that stand behind the realization of this cd is unclear. There's no need to spend money on it."
4,Carnival of Souls (Psychorama Editon),"After surviving a car accident during a drag race with a bunch of friends, Mary Henry (beautiful Candace Hilligoss) travels to Utah to begin work as church organist. When she begins seeing a mysterious tall man and experiencing moments of non-existence, she starts to fear that she is trapped between the world of the dead and the world of the living. ""Carnival of Souls"" was made on a shoestring budget, but still remains to give me the creeps with its spooky organ music and otherworldy performances and direction. The edition I'm reviewing contains an effect added to the film in the late 70s for its re-release. It's called Super-Psychorama and adds green tint and strobe effects to the scenes with the spirits."
2,simple earrings,nice earrings - delicate earrings; good length for a person who is not sure they could wear dangling earrings
2,Cake decorating Simplified,NOT at all what I thought it would be. For the money this was really disappointing. I am just thankful I did not pay full price for this book. In my opinion simply NOT worth the effort even.
2,not applicable,I bought this book as a gift and had it mailed directly to the recipient. I haven't seen it so can't write a legitimate review.
3,"misrepresented at 4 X 5, it is actually 3.3 X 5","I received the rug today and although the design and quality is good, I am very disappointed that it only measures 3.25 feet by 5 feet instead of the advertised 4 X 5 foot size. The size was a major consideration when deciding to purchase the rug. Therefore, I am very disappointed in the inaccurate advertising."
4,I like this but thought it was going to be bigger.,I thought I selected the larger option and expected a bigger rug but the colors are vibrant and the picture on the rug is nice.
3,Okay product for the price,I bought this for my grandson's room. It is a little small for the space it is being used in.
5,lots of fun,This rug is great for small toy cars and trucks and provides hours of fun for my grandson. It has a great layout that provides a nice city layout with roadways - great for encouraging the imagination!
3,"In 3'3"" x 4'10"" size, picture did not match what arrived.","Not a huge deal here, but the picture at the time of purchase showed a country landscape with gray roads. What arrived has blue roads. I can probably live with it, but the fact is that the picture is all the customer has to go on when ordering online, so it is important for the seller to get it right, and this one didn't in my case. Just something to keep in mind when ordering this product from Spectrumrug."
3,Cute at first but...,"Was pretty cute at first. Less than a year later, the rubber backing has fallen apart. Careful, it will stick to hardwoods."
1,As thin as it could be,"The rug is as thin as it could be. I bought tons of things from Amazon and normally have very good experience because I read review carefully before I buy. I don't know where these positive review came from. I am totally not a picky person and do not like to leave reviews, but this rug is totally a garbage and do not waste your money to buy it."
4,Great play rug,Wish it was bigger but great for the price.Love that bottom is non slip. The pile is shprt but not scratchy.
4,Great little rug for the little ones,"Purchased this rug for my 2 1/2 year old grandson. He loves the rug. Loves driving his car to all the different places. Little smaller than advertised, but for the toddlers it works great."
1,"Be sure you get an ""X"" and not an ""A""","I, too, received the lower capacity 49A instead of the promised 49X. Four times! Three by Amazon and once by Target. No amount of explanation by me could persuade them to check that large ""49A"" on the package (see my image, above) before boxing it and mailing it to me. On the fifth attempt, by phone, Amazon simply refused to try again. Yet, as of today, the product is still offered for sale at the attractive $71.99 price."
3,"Amazon screwed up here, might be fixed now","I ordered the 5949X, Amazon sent the 5949A. I sent it back, they sent another 5949A. The third time, the rep told me Amazon's SKU is probably messed up on this item. Take your chances ordering this here, but I would recommend ordering somewhere else for this, because Amazon has had difficulty managing the inventory info properly on this item."
4,"Great product, minor issues.","At first, the printer would not accept the cartridge. Was able to override that issue, but the printer then gave a low toner message long before it ran out."
3,What could be special about toner?,"Toner cartridges are so amazingly overpriced, you'd think the industry was being run by petrolium, health insurance, or cellular communications executives. Whenever I have to reorder one of these cartridges, I get that same feeling when I get when I pay my health insurance premium or fill up for neary $4/gallon.The cartridge is fine and all, but why do they have to be so dang expensive? The printer itself is magnificient and puts out beautiful documents in a very short time. My laserjet 1320 is a great printer and it hooks up beautifully with all of my macs. So despite the outrageous price of the ink cartridge, I am always happy when it fits so nicely into the printer and I get some of the great documents it produces."
1,Never received it nor a refund to date.,"I paid for the cartridge, and tracked its delivery. Because it was ""free"" delivery, they sent it the cheapest way possible, which is a hybrid delivery that starts FEDEX then changes to the local Post Office. However, since they used the physical address instead of my P O Box I never received it. And, they would NOT give me a refund until they received the cartridge back from their carrier. They could see I never received it, but would not give me the credit. Neither the provider nor Amazon would do anything, and I didn't receive it for the large printing project I needed it for. Bad service from Amazon. Bad service from the provider. Would never buy from either again. Then wouldn't even give me the credit and reship once they knew it was never delivered. Instead, both of them asked me to just pay for a second cartridge. Poor business practice."
1,OUCH! whose brainchild was this? It has no use ever being made or produced!,"The 49A cartridge gives you about 2,500 pages of print.The 49X gives you about 6,000 page of print, for ONLY about 4 dollars more in price!The 49A costs about 33.5 cents per page printed.The 49X costs about 12 cents per page printed.Why would anyone buy the 49A cartridge and pay almost 3X as much per page of print?Where I work, I made sure our supply folks order ONLY the 49X cartridges."
2,Toner Defective,Toner was 49A as expected but had an unmarked chip and cheap labels with a markings on the generic label itself. The toner also had a puncture hole and several scratch marks in the thick plastic body. The ink was fine and probably would have 2500 pages as described. The unit I received printed smudges on both edges of the page. Marked it as defective and returned it. Nice thing is Amazon fulfills the order. Price was nice but realize your gut and know this will be a cheap product.
4,Wish there was a high capacity catridge,Everything works like it is supposed to.Order filled correctly and shipped on time.I only wish HP had designed a high capacity cartridge for the HP 1160 Printer.
2,"Fits my printer, and it ends there",It prints light on ink and leaves a streak on the side of the paper. OEM HP product does not do this in my past experience. I guess I get what I pay for...
1,Leaves Roller Streaks,It leaves roller streaks on every page. The box says 100% performance guarantee but does not list a company name anywhere or point of contact if the product is defective. You get what you pay for.
3,HP Q5949A,I had a problem getting the printer to acklowledge the cartridge was installed. Finally turned of printer and restarted it and it worked.
1,Leaves marks on the side,"This cartridge fit my printer and prints. However, it leaves incremental black smudges on the side of every page it prints. I tried cleaning it, but it didn't make a difference. I thought I'd save money with this, but it definitely wasn't worth it."
4,It is a good deal,We all need to replace these from time to time. This was the best price I could find for this toner.
4,Works adequately well,"I have used this type of toner for years for my 10-year-old HP laserjet printer. It's the major expense of operating a printer. This brand never seems to provide as many copies as it advertises, but the various times I've used off-brands, it's about the same, so I don't bother shopping around much anymore. The past 3 years I've done my best to print information on paper as little as possible and go paperfree as much as I can, so over time this product has become something I rarely use. Which means that these days, a cartridge that previously was used up with about 2000-2200 copies in a year, now lasts me for 3-4 years."
5,"Ink Toner, Used",I received the ink toner as promised and it works great. Good price compared to a new one at HP.
4,Non-technical and readable,"No footnotes, and all based on secondary research, but this book I found fun to read. The accounts of the 8 generals profiled are consistently interesting and this book makes for good light reading"
2,Not so good; sorry,"The sound is authentic, the recording has fidelity, and the cadence is perky.But this album is not the match for some of my older calliope collections on vinyl (I know: I'm a dinosaur, but I'm trying to evaluate the music, not the recording technology).While trying to collect some newer calliope CDs, I purchased this. But all the tunes seem to be played in a single octave, with a few notes below that.Alternate recommendations are welcome. Most reviewers seem to like this CD, recorded 1973+, so don't take me too seriously. It's just food for thought."
4,"Fun Music for Kid's Parties, Likely Won't Listen to it again",I purchased this compilation because we had carnival themed birthday party for our daughter. It did the job. Not much in this collection that's going to make me listen again.
4,If you like Calliope music.......,"If you like calliope music, this is a great CD to buy. Of course, after a while, every song sounds the same, but they all sound good."
3,Serta Memory Foam Pillow,The foam insert emits a chemical odor that is bothersome to me and the foam cannot be machine washed.
5,A Great Escape!,"This is my all-time favorite book by Susan Branch! The recipes, the ideas, the personal stories all bring it home. When the dog-days of summer hit I reach for my copy and escape ~ she has so many ideas that don't take a lot of pre-prep. Her recipes are great (try the potato salad or the pacific coast peelers). A great addition to anyones cooking library and a must for those soon-to-be-brides! I have even given this book as a hostess thank you. You won't be disappointed!"
1,Very poor quality silver.,"This ring is on a par with what you might get from a bubble gum machine. The silver is of very poor quality, and you can actually bend it with your fingers.Very flimsy, and it is definitly going to be returned."
2,disappointment,"I thought this ring looked interesting in the photo, but in person it is flimsy, flexible and relatively cheap looking."
1,Cheap-looking,"I went with the positive reviews on this ring and ordered it. When it arrived, I immediately packed it back up and returned it. It is cheap looking and thin. And what is worse, by the time I paid shipping and the restocking fee, it cost me almost $10 NOT to buy this crappy ring."
1,Worst Twista Album to Date,"Time and time again....it almost seems that success kills the musical passion for something better. This sounds like any other club music out today. Nothing original here. More of the same. I was really disappointed with the last one, but this is even worse. Twista really had my hopes up with the Adrenaline Rush title to the album and everything. I thought he might just come back with something special, but it turns out to be just more of the same sounding radio junk. Maybe cool to play in the club, but nothing I want to listen to in my spare time.For the youngsters or people who are new to Twista; go get the original Adrenaline Rush, it's a straight classic."
2,aight,"Twista is a cat that i dig,but he has settled for the sideline role on his own albums. after coming back in 2003 thanks in large part to ""Slow Jamz"" with him and Kayne West and Jamie Foxx, Twista got another life. thing is, he is riding backseat on his own albums since then. this album follows the same formula over the previous few albums. I dig Love Rehab with Twista and R.Kelly. that track is a banger. the rest of the album is hit and miss though for me. nothing that he hasn't already done before. and unlike a decade ago Twista is making his songs more toward airplay which for me at times takes away from that rush and vibe he spitting a decade back. this album ain't bad,but it is more about a cut here and there then a overall album that is a straight play all the way. but to Twista's credit he has survived the game and can roll with the modern day punches.re-inventing yourself to stay in the game."
1,same old shi$^#%,"dont get me wrong I like twista, and this cd is ok, but definely nothing special. theres nothing on this cd that i havnt heard before. theres just no groundbreaking material on here. mabye twista's style is just getting played out?? to me it's just not much differnt from any of his other releases. by far his worst effort thus far."
2,What Happened?,"Twista was one of my hands down favorite artists ever since the original ""Adrenaline Rush"". I nearly melted that disk in my old Sony CD Player and have since bought AT LEAST 4 new copies of that album (I tend to lose CDs).Unfortunately, ever since the original A.R. Twista's albums have gotten worse and worse (except for Mobstability which wasn't a solo effort). They say the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. I must be insane because I keep buying Twista's CDs expecting tight beats and his unique flows - instead I get watered-down beats and flows that are mediocre at best.I hope his next effort is even half the CD that the original Adrenaline Rush was, this one wasn't even a tenth. If I lose this CD - I'm definitely NOT buying another."
3,Well it's a hell of a lot better than Kanye's,"After being so disappointed with that Graduation[...], it was good to hear Twista. Maybe that's why I'm feeling this cd so much. After his last cd which I still bump I took a chance getting this one and thank God out of buying two cd's that one was straight. This isn't a classic but I can play this cd straight through and enjoy it."
1,Everybody Makes Mistakes..,"This is a waste of money...To be honest....this album has only one acceptable track ""Jenny from the block"".It is too bad when people use their looks to support their career....AND THAT'S WHAT SHE DID IN THIS ALBUM...Not STYLISH....Not ARTISTIC...NOT CREATIVE...AND WAY TOO BORING..thats what this C.D. is all about.ALTHOUGH I STILL AGREE ABOUT THE SUCCESS OF LOPEZ...still,not good enough as a singer....She is only suitable in screen...And one more thing:Please dear fans,don't make out of yourselves a bunch of lawyers...by critisizing peoples who don't support your Jenny...She is only oneJenny from the block-AS SHE SAYS-Not the Virgin Mary..She is a human...like us...Who makes mistakes...and have bad thoughts.."
1,what is this?,"I bought this cd beacuse all the PR jennifer is getting. I haven't liked her singing, or acting for that matter. I really don't understand how a bad singer and a ""almost there,OK"" actor have reached the stardom that she has. OK Britney did it to, and now she is out of the picture. Anyway, I listened to it and went back the next day and changed it to Charmbracelet, and boy am I glad. I love that CD. Mariah Carey is truly talentet, both at singing and writing. I think Jenny is a bomb ready to explode and in a few years she will be long gone. Im sorry but I really think so. The ballads is a joke. :-("
5,Im Very pleased i bought this good job jen,I believe this is some of her best musical work yet and that she has really improved as a singer i love most of the tracks and can listen to the album all the way through tracks such asStillLoving youThe oneIm gladAll i haveAgainAre very good and all have potential to be singles she has done a great job. Well done with all your success jen you will be recieving a lot more if you carry onlike this.
1,Sappy collection of pop lovesongs....BORING!!,"I was SO disappointed by this cd. I love the song ""Jenny from the Block""...fun, hip, danceable. I hoped there would be lots of that style....but there isn't. This is a collection of sappy popcorn lovesongs that is ridiculously disappointing. And to boot? They all sound the same!! BORING!! I'll be selling this cd to the first buyer...."
1,J-Lo or J-hit the low,"""Jenny from the block"" is an ok song, but I am getting sick of it already. However, the rest of the album is just [weak]. Are we in second grade? She just lacks the depth and singing ability for her to be doing those type of songs. ""Dear Ben""...Please! It's just ridiculous how much she wants publicity with her now 3rd hubby-to-be. ""I'm glad"" also lacks the flow and just her voice makes it even worse. ""Still"" could've been a good song, but again, her voice makes it seem to be missing it. Her previous albums were good, but this one just makes it clear that Jennifer doesn't know how to sing, however, nobody has told her so because she is trying to. Ballads are just not her type, she should leave those to Whitney, Celine, and Mariah. She should stick to more RnB and Hip Hop songs. Sorry JLO, but you really hit the ultimate low with this album."
2,Nice....,J.Lo is the best of her.... but This... I refuse myself to say about this album.... Is better to you buy just the single of Jenny fron the Block....
1,Pleuuuzzzzze,"This is perhaps the worst cd of the year! Unlike her last effort, most of the songs are horrible. There are no stand-outs like ""I'm real"" which was actually pretty good. And what's with ""Jenny from the block""...man, I want to blow my ears out after listening to that pretenious song."
1,The worst album of the year.,"looks like J-low has really reached a new low with this album, both musically and vocally. Most of the songs sound the same, and discuss her relationship with Ben.However the biggest let down for the album is j-lo's voice. in the past, her voice was well produced and it's weakness was well hidden, however on this album, her voice seems to be stripped and put bare into the mix. this ruins what would otherwise be acceptable songs, such as 'still' 'loving you' 'i'm glad'.YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED- get Mariah's 'charmbracelet' or Christina's 'Stripped' instead for some real quality music."
1,Horrible,"This is the worst one yet - With all her success & money you would think she would hire decent songwriters and producers. There is nothing remotely close to decent singing on this album - she falls way flat - and w/ a song like ""Dear Ben"" come on you can do better than this."
1,I'm not allowed to rate it 0,"you would think that having different writers on your album/back up singers (with better voices than the actual singer)singing most of the chorus'/ a good prodecer/ some of the best rappers on your albumn it would be a good albumn. But with THIS IS ME THEN that is NOT the case.Its a load of s#!t. she really cant sing but thinks she can. shes too overated coz shes pretty (no doubt) and seems to be in the way of the people who can really sing. i would recommend charmbracelet by mariah,love and war by jerzee monet or amerie's new one. REAL MUSIC REAL VOICES!unfortunatly she doesnt take the music seriously. she cannot be called a diva if she cant sing, do her own back up vocals, sing her own chorus; ect. The back up singers (including NIVEA) and the editors are the people who should be on the front cover of her CD"
1,Syrupy Slop,"This album is a complete dud. If you think ""Jenny from the Block"" is bad, believe me, it gets much worse. Her voice is too weak to sing ballads. If the ballads were good she might could get by with her limited voice, but no such luck. This cd will make many music fans remember Paula Abdul and think, ""Hey she wasn't as bad as I thought."" People thought JLo could be the next Madonna, but to me she's not even good enough to be the next Paula Abdul. What's with all the divas releasing bad albums? Mariah Carey, Whitney and now Jennifer Lopez have all seen their latest albums trashed. There is a reason for this....they all are bad albums!"
5,A great cd,"This cd's is one of the best cds when listened to in detail. I have come to realise that the strength of a voice is not as important as artistry. Sure whitney mariah and most other female singers can sing but have you heard their last albums? They were horrible.J LO has given us a worthy album that everybody in the hood bumps daily but on the down low. Everyone has this cd but wont admit it because as a package its a great albumAlbum highlights are the brilliant""still"" which when listened becomes more and more intoxicating. Why this wasnt a single i have no idea.Other highlights include ""again"" ""the one"" and the ll cool j asisted ""all i have"". ""i'm glad"" is also great. ""Dear Ben"" is not that bad either. All of my girlfriends love ""you belong to me""Put this cd on a sunday morning when you are reading the paper and fall in love. The whole 70's mood music worked.A classic!!!!!"
3,This CD is boring,Oh My GOsh. WHat happened TO J.Lo. This CD was not good. I don't ever listen to it. If I do I only listen to Jenny From THe BLock and All I Have. All the other songs have good beats but it does not seem her voice is for the music choices she has. Most of the songs seem the same and they are much to slow for me. I gave it three star because I like Jenny From the block and All I have.But I'm sure glad I did not waste my money on this CD because I copied it from a friend.
1,Beware! Is not worth buying,"No offence Jennifer Lopez is very talented and is better when it comes to acting, on this last production she has songs that are not her style, like come on is no secret that J.lo cant sing she sounds ok on songs like ""Jenny from the block"" but like on dear Ben please. I recomend Charmracelet by Mariah Carey or Stripped by Christina now with there voices you will be satisfy."
1,Just Plain Bad,"I don't know what happened with this cd, but it is not what I would have expected from Jennifer Lopez. She has done so well with her past albums, usually with the help of others, but something just wasn't right about this. I like ""All I Have"" with LL Cool J, but only because LL is on it. I think her use of ""Very Special"" in the song is shameful.Instead of venturing out for a new sound like this in the future, the future Mrs. Ben Affleck should just stick with what works. Either that or stick with acting, period."
4,GREAT ALBUM,"Jenny has now become more from the block with this succesful album. I really love this album, with the exception of some slow songs such as ""Dear Ben"". My favoite tracks in this album are ""Jenny from the block"", ""I am glad"", ""The one"", and ""All I have"" w/ LL COOL J.Jennifer Lopez knows how to make the world rock with her music, movies, and music video, and her sexy silhouette."
2,Aaaahhh! What a waste.,About album has about5 decent songs but they are wasted on someone who couldn't sing her way out of a paper bag.
1,She Loves Ben,"First of all, I must state that I like Jennifer Lopez. I think she is a talented singer, dancer, and actress. Now that I said that, I HATE this album. I love ""Jenny"", but all the other songs are so obviously about her trying to convince the world that she loves Ben. Well, I am happy for her, but I don't want to hear 10 songs about it. One would be plenty. The whole album is a love song to Ben and how he has changed her life- blah...blah...blah...I am all for love and happiness, but I like JLo best when she is spunky and perky-not all mushy-mushy. I just hope her next album is more JLo and less Mrs. Affleck."
5,J Lo Scores Another Big Hit,I thoroughly enjoyed this cd. I am a big fan and most of the songs on this cd really hit home. Go J Lo Go. You go girl!
2,stop torturing ameica,seriously J>LO CAN not SING. And what makes this album even worse is taht she is tryuing to prove that she is an alright singer i like only 2 tracks which are still and alli have which can be downloaded from itunes insteda of wasting money on this gabage
5,cool cd,This is a great CD. THe girl has talent! Let her be! If you dont like her music dont listen to it! I think all songs on this album are great!
3,Decent CD,I have all of her other CDs & I got this one for Christmas.. I like it... it's easy to listen to. It's a little cheesy with the lyrics & all the songs except Jenny from the Block are love songs.. but I like it.
4,JENNY TONES IT DOWN,"While it's certain Jennifer Lopez is no Mariah Carey (or Madonna for that matter), she has decided to tone down what she's famous for, catchy computerized noise and all-star producing. Only the bare essentials are evident on this record, a neo-soul filler album that it seems only devotees could love. Being one such devotee, I loved it. The ever-catchy ""Jenny from the block"" is extremely dancable, while her blatantly bland ""Glad"" falls just short of boring. She brings a more earthy feeling to a Carly Simon classic, ""You Belong To Me"" and records one of her best tracks yet, the smile-inducing ""Baby I Love You."" While this record isn't nearly as polished or hit-worthy as her past efforts, ""This is me...then"" seems to be a stepping stone to something better."
3,JENNY FROM THE BLOCK,"She's gonna go straight back to the ghetto block after this CD. I'M GLAD is the bomb track, but there's only 3 other good tracks and the rest of the CD is...let's just say it's not even good enough for her neighborhood. Okay CD, has a couple jams...but there are too many weak tracks, very rushed and unprepared."
1,ERICA HANSON IS A DUMMIE :D,"My girlfriend purchased this particular album and honestly I reefed it out of my car stereo after about 3 songs snapped it in two and tossed it out my driver side window, and then handed her 20 dollars for her loss. I felt it would be fun to share this story and couldn't help but snicker at a review posted on this album by one ERICA HANSON. I read it and saw what she said about FEELING everything in jennifer lopez' music and was tickled. Get a clue girl, she's rich you aren't you have no idea what it's like to be her but keep dreamin :D"
1,How low did J-LOW go?,"Low enough to steel from every accomplished artists music i can think of on this album. Lets start with Mariah. J-LOW quickly re made and hardly re arranged Mariah's song Boy ""I need you"" feat. camron on her new song "" all I have"" feat. LL cool J, and so many others, not to mention that most praise her as the latino Janet jackson, which she is deffinatly not.....hmmm, I wonder were she got the title "" again"" from....And we just love those re-cycled dance moves to. Now lets go back to Mariah's song called ""The One"" from her new album ""Charmbracelet"" oh wait...J-LOW has that same title....hmmm. Maybe she was never taught 2 sylibal words, because she sure cant come up with her own. Tommy Mottola sure has his little mob fingers in every orophis of her career."
2,We get it...you're in love with ben affleck!!!,"on all of her albums so far, there are a couple songs here and there that are catchy and have a nice beat...she can carry a tune every now and then, but mostly you can tell that she is trying too hard to let the notes out. she's not a real singer and most people just buy her cd cause of her past dance songs or r&b duets with rappers or probably cause she's pretty. otherwise, hearing her sing songs of love to her ""dear ben"" gets annoying, especially since the lyrics are kinda lame and cheesy. but its cute, i get it, if i had ben affleck id probably be as lame and cheesy too. the point is...unless you want to hear a cd full of love songs clearly about ben, sung by someone who is as bad a singer as britney spears, then you should get it!"
1,Boring,The only good song on this cd is Jenny from the block. It was also the only fast upbeat song. Has she/ or the record company not notice that her best song's are upbeat remixes. In my opinion her voice doesn't sond her best when she sing's slow songs.
1,Soapy,"J.Lo and R'n'B fans will be VERY disappointed. ""Jenny From The Block"" is the only interesting track on the album, the rest being all ballads about how much she loves Ben Affleck.Might as well have called it ""Till The Next Husband"""
3,JUST ALRIGHT,"Even though Jennifer Lopez is not that good of a singer, she does deliver okay songs. I can say that she never really released a single that was really ""da bomb"" but they held up very good. On this album, Jennifer experimented with a lot of old school beats and blended in her vocals. My favorite track is number 4 which is ""The One"", a song she wrote about Ben Affleck who's now history in her eyes. Jennifer Lopez albums will only sell because of her popularity. This album is just okay but could have been better."
2,not as good as her first 2 albums,"While I thought her first two albums were still quite nice, dancey and interesting in Latin styles, this album turns out to be rather weak. You really hear that her voice is not the strongest and so are her tracks. The beats are ok, but don't expect to find anything that goes beyond the single tracks."
1,TONS of songs about Ben and one about being from the block,"Out of all the albums she has out, why did I have to buy this one? I was torn between Aaliyah's CD and hers. I should have gone with Aaliyah's. I got this one mainly because of the song ""All I have"", but now I don't like it that much. ""Jenny from the block"" was okay when I heard it the first few (or more) times, but then it started to get boring. A lot of the tracks on this CD sound the same to me. It's unbelievable (and not in a good way). ""I'm glad"" is an okay song, but it's just not that great. Plus, there are ONLY 11 songs? You might as well download them. Or just download the songs I mentioned. Why is every song (except ""Jenny from the block"") about Ben? Don't get me wrong, I like J-Lo, but this CD is terrible. And what's with the title (This is me...then)? Huh?"
1,What the ....,"I dont know , but its all bad bad bad bad. the girl cant sing at all, because of selena and pdiddy shes nothing anyway, I know shes a pretty girl(only now) but back in her fly girls time? Oh no! dont even ask. Oh well money can buy anything, especially cream de lamer LOL."
2,What happened to Jennifer...Now?,"Okay, I am normally the type of person to give someone props even if they don't deserve it, but this album is just too much. About half the tracks are decent. By far, the best tracks are ""All I Have"" and ""Jenny From The Block."" Her voice is not strong enough to carry the ballads like Mariah Carey could. ""You Belong To Me,"" ""I've Been Thinking,"" and ""Loving You"" are worth a listen."
2,singing lessons needed,"This girl has got some great producers, they gave her some great beats...unfortunately she doesn't have the vocals to back them up. her idea of singing is talking with a lil' bit of force. one of the songs ""Jenny from the block"" is a pop fave but actually very annoying after you hear it for the 43rd time in one day. ""i'm glad"" has one of the worst choruses ever, i've never heard a line written as bad. i was recently most disappointed though when i heard her song ""baby i love you"" which is actually very catching except for the horrible lack of singing in it."
1,She should stick to acting.,"The sound of her voice simply makes my ears ache. she has no vocal range, and she lacks in originality. She needs so much sound equipment to give her a somewhat decent voice that her ""fans"" fail to realize the woman can't sing. When she tries to belt out a song it sounds like nails against a chalkboard. Hopefully this will be her last album."
1,This Was Pretty Bad,"SHe doesn't have the greatest voice, but at least with her previous albums she had a few catchy songs, this one didn't have anything."
1,Still Undefined,"With this CD, it becomes even more apparent that Jennifer Lopez is not only a victim of the corporate machine, but a victim of her own creation. Given the number of producers on each track, you'd think it'd be possible to come up with one song that isn't simplistic and bad. Well, that premise would be wrong.She is still unsure of what direction to take musically and that makes her come across as some sort of artistic mish-mosh as she tries a bit of this and a bit of that. Add to this the fact she still doesn't use her voice properly (she needs to take it down a notch).""Jenny from the Block"" is a hypocritical tank of a song and yet it does have a nice background beat. It's a shame she didn't more with the lyrics. No one's buying the ""don't be fooled by the rocks that I got"". Instead, what she should have done was added lyrics in which she's got the heart of the Bronx and the bling of success.Horrible. Just absolutely horrible."
2,It left me asking...Is this J.Lo...now?,"Excited by the new single ""Jenny From The Block"" I ran out to buy the cd ""This Is Me...Then."" But after listening to it in its entirety, I was left asking myself...Is this J. Lo...now? What happened to our favorite R&B senorita? Has love cast the sappy song spell on her? I liked Jennifer better when she teamed up with Rap heavy weights and produced slammin' remixes we could dance to! ""This Is Me...Then"" is one long love song to Ben, which leaves me gasping, ""Get a room!"""
1,Don't buy it people!!!,"This has got to be the worst album of 2002!!! Whereas in her previous releases, 3 or 4 of the tracks were bearable to listen, this one has even the first single, Jenny From Da Block a nightmare to the ears. I can't believe I really bought it. Jennifer Lopez should stick to acting or dancing or whatever fits her but singing is definitely not her speciality. Oh and I almost forgot, Dear Ben is probably her worst song ever. Um, let me rephrase it, probably the worst song ever. So corny, so bad. Go buy Mariah Carey's ""Charmbracelet"" instead or i don't know, but take my advice and stay away from this poison."
1,Don't even bother...,"Seriously speaking... I have her first album.. not bad had some nice songs.. but this one is a waste of time and money.. the songs are all sappy, JLO is one of the most overrated celebrities out there.... and she seriously thinks she can sing. I've heard her live and she can't carry a tune.. I had a friend let me borrow it first before I even went and bought it.. She needs to get over herself.. too bad for who ever spent the [money] on it. I recommend better albums out there like Charmbracelet from Mariah Carey & Norah Jones Come with Me. Who I feel are true artitst.. in every sense of the word. They write their songs, produce, etc..."
1,Not so good enough,nice but somehow similar dances. ballads are the same....not so good. To evryone who wants to buy this album......THINK TWICE! or MORE!
2,Not quite what I was hoping to find...,"I was anticipating hearing all the songs on this CD after I heard Jenny from the Block. Most of the songs on this CD are mushy and good for cuddling with the man next to the fireplace. But if you're looking for a CD filled with rhythm, beat and fun stuff to dance to, keep looking..."
1,This is music?,"Nope; this is hype, just like her last 2 albums. Jlo is beautiful, true. But she's an abysmal singer (all her CDs are so techno-enhanced it hurts) and an extremely mediocre actress. But once again, hype can sell anything and make anyone a star. And all those who say Jlo works so hard? When people out there are willing to pay you ridiculous dollars for being completely average, it's pretty easy to look like you're working hard, because you really don't have to work as most of us define the word."
1,What's this [trash],"This CD is terrible on every level. There is no artful chances being taken, no substance, and no sense of style at all in any of the songs on this awful CD. What this album is just TRL-oriented hip-hop junk aimed at simple-minded suburbia kids. ""Dear Ben"" is sickeningly sappy to an unbearable lever. I don't mind a little sappiness from time to time but ""Dear Ben"" is just stomach-turning! This CD almost sounds more like a 10 year old who has a crush on someone and I can't believe that this is coming from a 30 something person. Stay far away from this album as much as possible. I haven't heard such horrid sludge in many years!"
3,J Lo's New Album is Lukewarm,"Though I love Jennifer Lopez, This Is Me...Then is a watered-down version of On the 6. Her vocals, while stronger than on past albums, still leaves much to be desired, especially when compared to her contemporaries who are currently charging up the charts: Christina Aguilera, Missy Elliot, Michelle Branch, etc. The best song from this album is Jenny from the Block and without the catchy hooks and old school samples, this album wouldn't see the light of day had it been released by someone not quite as famous. I expected more."
1,Give me a break!,"I thought this album was BORING and SLOW! I mean, give me a break a song titled ""Dear Ben"" She's addicted to love and seems to fall for every guy she works with. Her voice is sounds like she's got a cold. There are no songs that are catchy or fun, they're all slow and boring. This album [slow]."
1,There should be a new title for this CD,"This new and most anticipated CD of Jennifer Lopez' should have a new name...let's call it ""THIS IS ME....WITH BEN"" This is a collection of slow love songs...which painfully shows just how weak her vocals are...she should stick with ""Jenny from the Block"" type hits...and steer away from ballads...which is what this entire CD is made up of...there are 12 songs on this CD...and only one decent track...not worth the Money at all...there is nothing to dance to and certainly nothing to clean your house to..."
3,"Not that bad, but not that great either","A lot of people have trashed this cd as saying it is the worst of the year. I have to admit this isn't like anyone of her previous cds. There are no dance numbers here(probably ""Jenny from the Block"" only). I have to admit it is kind of slow, but there are still some good songs. My favorites are: Still, Loving You, The One(Version 1), All I Have, Jenny from the Block and Dear Ben (the song is not that bad; only the name). Next time I hope she seeks a balance between the kind of music her fans want to hear."
2,Hmm...,"I really like Jennifer Lopez, but I don't see any originality in this new album. She samples so much of other people's music throughout the CD. I'd like to hear more of her own style. Does she have her own style?"
4,It could of been better,"This Jennifer Lopez CD, is more melow then her past CDs. Most of her songs were talking about love and it got kinda boring. I think that CD could have been better and she needs to rock out a little more."
3,JLo's 3rd Studio Joint,"This CD is actually pretty good, in my opinion. It has a very thick R&B vibe, as though she's trying to totally abandon any trace of her pop roots. I thinks it's very short, as well as most of the songs. Almost all of the songs hover around the 3 min 40 second mark. Jennifer has become more of a personality that is famous by just being herself (i.e. Janet, Cher, Madonna. None of them can sing all that well, but they have the looks and charisma that works for them. If you liked Jennifer's past stuff, you'll like this one!"
2,Go back to the real J.L.O. Jennifer!!!,It's kind sicking to hear Jen um um like being so stuck up over Ben. HELLO JENNIFER THIS ISN'T YOUR FIRST BOYFRIEND!!!!!!!!!!!! ever since she and were dating All she ever tALKS IS BEN ALL THESE SONGS ARE ABOUT BEN!!!! sHE HAS HAD OTHER RELASHINSHIPS!!!!! aND WHAT'S SOOOOOOOOOO GREAT ABOUT BEN ANYWAY??!! i DIDN'T THINK SOOO.
5,Relaxing and Soulful,Jennifer's CD is the best she ever made. This really expresses the way she feels about Ben. I really love this album and i recommend this album to anyone :).
1,Better buy something else,nice dances and nice songs! thanks to the backup singers of jlo. Sorry jennifer Im a fan of yours.......all i can say is that......better act. You cant sing baby. You cant be Mariah or whitney. the dances are nice but some of them are alike somehow.....while her ballads.......! Ballads are not your line. Just focus on latin dance songs! ... :( I regret buying this Cd!
1,Jennifer Can't Sing,"I bought this Album because it was a top seller. Unfortunately people have been wasting their money on junk. I wasn't sure wether it was a dog, cat or a human being singing. Not only are the vocals hideous, but the lyrics were very elementary. What educational background does JLO have. She didn't complete high school or what. This Album is ghetto. I strongly believe Epic should terminate her contract. Epic has brought us very talented and creative artists in the past. I strongly believe Jennifer Lopez is a failure and dissapointment. If you are considering buying this album I urge you not to."
1,Was this written by a 13 year-old with a crush?,This is probably the worst album I've ever bought. My only consolation is that I got it used for less than ten bucks. The only good songs are Jenny From the Block and the LL Cool J song. Really it's pretty pathetic!
2,Singing lessons indeed recommended..........!,"One of the worst singers i've heard.......... frothy throat, strained vibrato, not to mention very thin and not well together. Pinched coloratura- strained above the passaigo, to sum it up: tortured, twisted, abused and resigned vocals."
3,"Bad Singer, Good Album","Jenny is a painful singer to listen to. However, she is smart enough to leave it to her producers who do a great job. The melodies and production values just overshadows everything else that you are willing to forgive her vocals like how we did with Paula Abdul. This is a great pop album which fuses old-school beats with new pop melodies. I can hear all the producers who worked on this album sigh in relief and gratitude for Pro Tools and Auto-Tune."
1,When is she going to give up?,"Geez, how can anyone find any of her songs good?! I got tired of hearing ""Jenny from the block"" on the radio every two seconds so why should I buy the album? Thankfully, her trick of getting #1's (i.e. collaborating with Mariah Carey's rappers) has tired out so now everyone sees what an untalented 'singer' she is: the third single, ""I'm Glad"" and the new one, ""Baby I love you"" both flopped miserably. And rightly so. Let's just hope all her poor victims will wake up in time and won't buy her next album. If you wanna hear how a REAL singer sounds, pick up Mariah Carey's Greatest Hits, you can't go wrong there.P.S. even her new film with Ben Affleck, ""Giggling"", flopped at the box-office."
1,"Jenny, please go back to the block","Oh my God, I can't believe I wasted my time listening to this album. Did she go crazy or something? Her second album had some good songs but this album is trash. She's beautiful and a good actress but when it comes to music, I hope she retires."
1,BORING!,"This record is sorry. All of the 11 songs sound the same. ""All I Have"" is overplayed, ""Jenny From The Block"" is down-right [awful], and ""I'm Glad"" is very hard to listen to. The entire album is bland. ""This is Me - Then"" ...OK. What is that supposed to mean??? ... J.Lo's previous two albums wer 2-3 star material, but ""This is Me - Then"" is down-right [awful]. I DO NOT RECOMMEND PURCHASING THIS ALBUM. (Overall Grade: F)"
2,What happened?,"On hearing this album I was shocked - J-Lo has turned into Faith Hill! The urban vibes and attitude that define J-Lo have been limited to one song, 'Jenny From The Block'. This song belongs on the 'J-Lo' album, 'This Is Me...Then' sucks the power out Of the song. The other songs are just to slow and mushy for someone so fresh and fiesty. Even hard-core J-Lo fans shouldn't buy this album without having heard it first."
2,Better off on the Big Screen,"Jennifer Lopez is a fine and talented woman and there is no question about that...the problem with her music career is that she tries to cater to every audience at the snap of her finger. It just doesn't work that way..This album is like her last album to me...she tries to please her ricans, BET and MTV and it comes out confused. Yeah, Styles and Jadakiss sound good on her lead single ""Jenny from the Block"" but the video looks as if she still wants to show that there is life after Puffy....who cares..Jennifer Lopez should concentrate more on her acting career and leave the music to more focused artist..."
1,Wait before buying--people will be returning their copies!,"I liked her previous CDs because they were light-hearted and fun... Someone fooled Jennifer into thinking she was a ""serious artist"" able to belt out a ballad--WRONG! The only reason Jennifer even had a somewhat successful singing career is because she sang silly tunes you could sing along to on the radio. She had Latin-pop, dance tracks, and some R&B; influenced tunes. But with this CD she tries to sing slower songs and the results are horrible. She has a very, very unpleasant voice and her lyrics are laughable. When she's not talking about how ""real"" she is, she's going on and on about Ben. *Snore*Either you have the goods or you do not, and now that I hear how she really sounds without all the studio trickery, I know she DOES NOT HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO BE A REAL SINGER. This CD is awful and I will be taking it back for a full refund! So, if you want to buy it, just wait and pick it up used."
2,Latin Spice,"I have always had a weakness for the J Lo. Bought 'On the 6', cuz ""Waiting For Tonight"" was a great song to look at yourself in the mirror to while getting ready. Even 'J Lo' had great pop nuggets like 'Play' and 'Ain't It Funny"" , cheesy fun. The Remix album, i thought was a bit of a stretch, but we all know those Ja Rule songs were manipulatively charming. 'This Is Me...Then' is not good. 'Loving You' and Jenny From The Block' is the best the album has to offer, only because it downplays Ms. L-O's vocals. The woman can't sing. This reminds me of how bad we thought all of the Spice Girls (the one's who cant sing...4 out of 5, i think it is) solo albums were gonna be. My advice for Jenny Lo-Lo: if u wanna be a somewhat respected musician, just release a few singles. No album. I feel sorry for her when i hear her try to hit the high notes. We all do. Fingers crossed for 'Maid In Manhatten"". Sorry Lo."
1,Stick to dancing...and learn how to be a wife,"This album is definitely a collection of mushy tunes, that come off as unexperienced as her vocal talents. It seems her view on love is blurred into her songs, in turn making them as unrealistic as her marriages. She should call her next album ""true to myself"", because she really needs to be in order to rise up from her unrealistic approach as a musical artist.The album also samples without crediting the source, her catchy beat which holds her ""Jenny on the Block"" song together, comes from the group, ""Beatnuts"", from their hit song, ""Watch out now"". Shame on you J.LO...Good Luck Ben!!"
1,This sucks,"This is the most pathetic attempt i have ever heard, if i didnt have to give it at least one star i wouldnt. i cant believe i wasted money buying this piece of s**t. Her voice sounds so pathetic on this cd and it is nothing like JLO, which i thought was really good because of all the up-beat tracks. This album only has about 3 good songs on it, Jenny from the block(but the lyrics are so up herself!, and it was way overplayed) Im Glad, and All I Have. Dear Ben made me sick. I dont recommend this album to anyone!"
2,I like J. Lo but...zzzzzz.....,"It's not that this is that bad, it is that it is so catastrophically boring. She has eschewed the dance-latin-pop vibe that had an irresistible ...-shaking quality to it, for an impossibly bland, mid-tempo sound.The worst thing about this album is that when you try to hum or recall the tunes afterwards, you will most likely end up humming a different song done by somebody else. These are too generic.""On The 6"" and ""J. Lo"" are much better, with much more personality, and some catchier-than-hell tunes."
2,Jenny Jumps The Shark!,"I will admit i have been amused by these reviews! A few comments: 1) Didn't Mary J. or someone already use the ""You Are Everything"" notes in a song? 2) While ""You Belong To Me"" is a good choice, what is with the dog yelping sounds on it? Yucky. 3) A song like ""Still"" is really a good pop song, but I agree that her voice just starts to grate. 4) What was she thinking with ""Baby I Love You""? Did anyone have the nerve to tell her she can't really pull that off? At least put some more reverb on that voice.Oy, Miss Lo. Start again. 2 stars and I'm generous."
2,Do I Hear.... REMIX 2!!!,"When I first heard the single 'Jenny From The Block', I was anticipating for it's release and wondering if the rest of the cd sound just as good. I was also hoping she'd produce another dance tune like, 'Waiting For Tonight' or 'Feel'n So Good' since they were hits at the clubs. Instead there were a lot of bad ballads with awful lyrics and songs with the same beat. Overall this cd sounds like a really long, and may I add 'BORING', love letter to BEN AFFLECK. Hopefully her collaboration with Hex Hector, Thunderpuss, David Morales, or anyone can help her revive some of the songs in this cd.The only songs that stand out are:1 Still (cool intro, but they should've spent more time on this song, hopefully there's a remix radio edit in progress)2 All I Have 'featuring LL Cool J' (i really think this song should be in an LL Cool J cd and should read ""All I Have, featuring Jennifer Lopez"")3 Jenny From The Block (cool first single, she looks HOT in the video)"
3,"Not her best, but not the worst","we've all seen j-lo do better than this, but it wasn't the worst thing i've ever heard. though most of the cd is slow songs, a few of them aren't too bad. i think her new look is by far better than any of the songs though. better luck next time?"
1,A Pathetic 10 Tracks.....And Boring,"I thought Jenny from the Block was her worst single yet, but listening to the whole album, it sadly is probably the best single. The whole album is very slow and very boring. Her ballads are not powerful, since she doesn't have the pipes to pull them off. ""The One"" is okay and she will probably release it for a single. Jennifer...next time spend a little more time and effort instead of rushing the album out to hit at a time with all your publicity and new movie! This is her worst album yet, and one of the worst that I have bought. Don't waste your money!"
2,What Was Up With This CD?,"This Was Me...Then...just a sappy love sick high schooler, or so it would seem. This CD should have been titled A Love Anthem To Ben! I'm only giving it two stars because of the two singles she has out that aren't dripping with I love Ben this and I love Ben that. I hope the next one isn't so sappy!"
2,Big Disappointment!,"After hearing Jennifer Lopez's new single ""Jenny From The Block"", I had expected her new c.d. to be filled with cool and catchy songs like that. So I decided to check it out. It was just a big let-down. The only reason I rated it two stars was because of the song ""Jenny From The Block"". All the other songs are slooooow and syrupy. I'm not a big fan of slow ballads and songs, and I liked Jennifer's second c.d. better. Hopefully she will put out a better CD next time!"
1,''i am me'' ''this is me'' ''me is me'' ...........,"horrible cd titles from even worse performers.why is j-blo famous ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? her voice is similar to that of my gf when she screeches in the shower.her acting is similar to that of my 10 year old niece.her backside is similar to that of any,AND I MEAN ANY,latina(or any woman with a little meat on her bones)you see on the street.so again i ask,why is j-blo famous ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?(the answer probably lies in the ''blo'' part)"
1,Hype - thy name is JLo,"She has great marketing with little talent. Way better actress than singer. Perhaps she should have had Ashanti sing these songs too like she did on ""I'm Real"". Hope she will eventually take music as serious as she does her acting. Very silly songs and video. Now she's a hip-hop-urban street thug chick. I can't wait to see what she is next week."
2,it stank!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"it was about love and it was so boring, it had nice tunes but the name of the song ""dear ben"" the name sounds so desparate and the song ""i'am glad was very poor, ""all i have"" got very old. the only songs that sounded good were still, loving you, the one, and again, i am a huge fan but this album was just disappointing"
1,Boring,"Girl, I am sorry but this album is just weak! Where is the drama, the heart, the style? It is no where to be found on this album, this album is so bad I counldn't even give it away, even the library said they had too many copies, and I was like what am I supposed to do with it now? Needless to say I finally just through it out."
1,What Happened?,"DO NOT GO BUY THIS ALBUM! Now I am a J-LO fan and i have all of her cd's...I am even re-buying them because they are all scratched. But I do not have her new album ""This Is Me Then"" (Thankyou Lord!). I have heard it about 2 times all the way through and all I wanna know is what happened? I loved ""On the 6"" and ""J-LO"" and even the ""Remixes"" but this one should go back to the music warehouse and be locked up. I wanna know where the *PUERTO RICAN* Jenny went. She has absolutely NO latin songs nor beats in any of her songs. Has she forgotten that she's puertoriqueña? I don't know...but if yall thinkin' the same that I am, buy her old cd's or go out and buy some REAL latina artists...SELENA, THALIA, SHAKIRA, & OLGA TAÑON. Well thanx for actually reading this...PEACE!~SIEMPRE SELENA!"
1,Jenny Around the Block,"A new man, a new BAD album. Has J.Lo ever thought about just concentrating on acting? Cause her voice is horrible, ,,, The first single, Jenny From the Block, is poorly written and sung...It's no wonder she wrote it. Even her one of many love songs, ""Dear Ben"", displays her poor vocal quality. This album is the WORST of 2002! If you want to listen to good quality music, with a great voice...Try Mariah's Charmbracelet album...EXCELLENT!"
1,"Oversampled, and a whole pot of lameness..the Pics are NICE!","No Jlo. I am so disapointed in her. Although i didn't expect much, still this album is NOT enjoyable to My ears. I mean i like Divas who can sing. but i can make expections...(Janet, And Madonna aren't the best vocally yet have great music)Go back to the studio NEXT YEAR...get some Original beats, take a couple of voice lessons (i'm not joking) and write some better lyrics and i think Jenny will be in better shape."
1,Horrible,"What a joke this album is. First the girl can't sing and second the songs are just hilarious. JLO, girl your done!"
1,She needs help BADLY!,"Her last album ""J.Lo"" was good.......but this album is terrible! Her voice sounds so different! I asked for it for Christmas coz i thought it would be like ""j.Lo"" but it's just completely changed for the worse. I think it might be because she tried to write some songs(that went horribly wrong!)... her voice is really bad in this album.....don't waste ur money!"
3,not so great....,"I just started getting into Jennifer Lopez's music, i heard ""Jenny from the block"" and i though it was awesome...so i bought her latest CD. I like music that i can turn on, and feel the beat. This CD is for peeps that just sit down and listen to music or have some kind of slow hug dance. I found this cd boring. Don't waste your money."
2,Just buy the single - pass on the whole album,"I was really disappointed with this album. I liked the fun upbeat tempo of her other two albums and this one definitely does not continue that trend. I wish I had just bought the maxi-single for Jenny from the Block. My opinion is J Lo shouldn't be writing all her songs. While she is talented and beautiful, writing music is not her best suit. If you're interested in a more mello Jennifer, then you -might- like ths...but it's not real deep or lyrically interesting."
2,Disappointing,"This Jennifer Lopez cd is not very good. All of the songs are about ""Ben"" which gets on your nerves. The lyrics are all about "" how we are meant to be"" blah, blah, blah. I bought this cd for the song ""Jenny From The Block"", which that and about 2 other songs I like. I will not listen to this cd often, for just 3 songs. I would recommend not spending your money. The ballads showcase J-Lo's weak vocal chords. She should be doing more dance songs with rappers! The one thing that was nice about this cd is there are lyrics."
1,THIS CD IS TERRIBLE,"Jennifer Lopez cannot sing slow love songs..PERIOD...She has a weak voice and I think she is being a totally overboard with saying she is from the Bronx and she used to have nothing and now she has it all.... I own her last two cd's they are great. Writing a Song to BEN AFFLECK, and actually putting it on the cd is hilarious..."
1,this is boring... then,"please.. I can not believe i ever liked her. The first time I heard ""jenny from the block"" i loved that song.. I started singing it so much. When her cd came out, I couldn't wait to get it. but no. All her songs sound the same. repetion. repetition. all her songs sound the same. I can't even remember any of the song names except ""still"" and Jenny from the block. I would get Christina aguilera."
4,A Great Fourth Effort,"After three great albums, here comes another fantastic masterpiece, but it really isnt as good as the other three. Here's my take on it:STILL - 98% ExcellentLOVING YOU - 90% GreatI'M GLAD - 95% GreatTHE ONE - 82% AverageDEAR BEN - 78% Poor (we've seen enough of Ben & JLo!)ALL I HAVE with LL COOL J - 85% GoodJENNY FROM THE BLOCK with JADAKISS & STYLES - 90% GreatAGAIN - 85% GoodYOU BELONG TO ME - 85% GoodI'VE BEEN THINKIN' - 80% PoorTHE ONE (Remix Version 2) - 82% AverageAverage - 90% GreatJ TO THA L-O - 100% (i reccomend!)J.LO - 100% (i reccomend!)ON THE 6 - 85% (worse than this)Buy it and see if you like it!"
2,ABYSMAL THIRD EFFORT FROM J.LO,"I never thought she had the strongest voice, but at least Jennifer Lopez had catchy material and, of late, street-cred in the form of an urban reinvention.However, this album proves to be both a musical and career setback for Ms. Lopez. Her voice is shrill and bland in many of the songs. Of course, it wouldn't have mattered much if the songs themselves were any good. Bland, 70s' -inspired R&B production on boring, unmemorable tunes. The whole thing feels rushed, uninspired, and unfun. Only her collaboration with LL Cool J, and the current JENNY FROM THE BLOCK are noteworthy.Dont trust me? You'll see what I'm saying when the very first track plays..."
2,Get bored with the only rythm in,"This new album is more of J.Lo's rap, hip-hop, R&B style. All her songs are basically the same boring tempo and rythm. If you are expecting house music, freestyle or, even, latin music in this album, this is not the one. I have to wait one more year to see more of her latin and freestyle (house) music style. ""Still"", ""I am glad"" and ""the one"" are okay, but all songs sound the same. There is no variation in her songs, probably only in ""Jenny from the block."" I think this is not the best album of J.Lo. All her fans, like me, expect some house, freestyle, and latin music in all of her albums. I hope she thinks to make an album of her real latin roots or nuyorikan style like Lisa Lisa, Safire, Brenda K. Starr, The Cover Girls and much more. That was definitevely an era of freestyle puertorrican divas. As I said, wait one more year!!!"
3,"A good album, but definitely far short of what it should be","I will admit to being of two minds about this album. Personally, I think that many of the scathing reviews are pretty wide of the mark. It's a good, solid album that made it to number 2 on the Billboard 200 list, and spawning four hit singles. A lot of musicians dream of that kind of success.On the downside, it is true that it is somewhat dull album, and shows a J.Lo still searching for her own sound. I mean, it's a mix of really good songs and unimaginative ones. It's a good album, but definitely far short of what it should be. I give it a guarded recommendation."
3,eh...,"This CD is not what I expected at all. It's very mellow and mushy. I love J-Lo, but...yeah. None of the songs are anything like Jenny from the Block. I even made myself listen to it repeatedly, hoping it would grow on me, and it did-- a little. I'd say about 4 of the songs are somewhat good."
3,Oversampled,"This is a catchy album, but her latest 2 singles (Jenny from the Block and All I Have) though catchy are heavily sampled from previous hits by other artists. So far, J Lo's last 5 songs have beats that were sampled by earlier artists...isn't that how J Lo's ex P. Diddy almost lost his fan base a few years ago?"
1,Swine,"Absolute Garbage. Riding the coat tails of greats Gloria Estefan, and Carmen Miranda. get another job!"
4,Pretty Good =),"I expected more from this album, but it is actually pretty good. If you enjoy slow/R&B/Pop songs then..this is perfect for you. There are some good songs and some not so good songs. I recommend this album for the Jennifer fans."
4,Jennifer Lopez......Now,"Jennifer Lopez's new album is slightly different thanher previous albums. She has a deeper meaning into hersongs. She has co written more of her songs on this album.There are not great dance songs, however they can bedanced to. I think that this is a good album and showshow she is now."
1,Enough !!!,I have never admired jennifer s work over the years. But she has deliver some pretty good tracks that you dance to and j lo is her best album yet. But this one doesnt even have a glimpse at being good. The only people who could love it are Miss Lopez fans. But other then that music lovers or guys if you love jlo for her body dont buy this record because you gonna come to hate it !!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Dont listen to the negative reviews!,"Jennifer Lopez and her third album ""This is me...then"" is not as bad as people are making it out to be. Yes she got a away from her latin roots in the music, but still this album is really good.The album has some really stand-out tracks. Also Jennifer's vocals have improved majorly. Listen to her latest single ""Baby i love u"" the vocals are GREAT. Theres no doubt in my mind that Jennifer cant carry a tune, because she CAN!Dont listen to the negative rude reviews! Give this album a chance, you will enjoy it!"
5,great,i think that this cd is really good the only bad thing about it was the jenny from the block song. beacuse it was played out all like all last year. i was really surprized at how great these songs are beacuse iam not usually into slow songs or love songs. but its a great buy so dont pass it up.
2,"Definitely nowhere close to the album ""JLo""","When I bought her album ""JLo"", I fell in love with it! Then she released ""This Is Me...Then"", and I expected similar to ""JLo"". It came nothing close. The entire CD, with the acception of three tracks, are all samples of other songs. Therefore, almost the whole CD is really not her own. That doesn't really impress me much. The only two catchy tracks are ""Jenny From the Block"" and ""I'm Glad"". ""All I Have"" with LL Cool J got very sickening after about two weeks on the radio. I'd prefer to watch her on ""The Cell"" or ""Selena"" over this album. I think the only reason this album is such a success is because of the millions of dollars she has. This success is very much NOT deserved."
3,Hello,"To tell you the truth, I do like this album, but I think she should have released it in maybe a year or two. She's released an album after the other, after the other, after the other. She should have taken a break and come back to singing in a year. Other than that I love the album!"
1,This girl needs to GIVE UP and BACK OFF,"Her first album was fine-""Let's Get Loud"" and ""Waiting For Tonight"" were so much fun-but J. Lo and This Is Me...Then are CRAP! Why is she trying SOOOO hard to shove down the planet's throat that she's 'real'? Jesus Christ.....first the original ""I'm Real,"" then a remix, THEN she friggin tells us again in Jenny From The Block. Someone trying so hard to say they're real is obviously NOT. J. Lo, you should do a song called ""I'm Not Real."" That would be far more accurate. You're just a figment of the music world's imagination, and nothing more. You're a puppet. You're a fake. The last thing you are is 'real.'"
1,Jenny from the block? my foot,"Its simple and straight forward,the babe can't sing.No skills,plus,she can't kill a track the way mary j.blige,Tamia,Mariah carey,Alicia keys,Deborah cox&Amerie do.She can't hit hgh notes and she sells because of her body"
1,Don't buy it!,"I love JLo's movies and loved her JLo CD and her remix CD but I totally hated this album. I bought it thinking it would be a good CD and after listening to it once I realized it was a waste of money. I should have listened to it before I bought it. She really disappointed me. The only good song in her album is her first single Jenny From the Block. The other songs [are bad]. Mostly because she CAN'T sing! She's doing songs that only people like Mariah Carey, Toni Braxton or Whitney Houston could do. These are ballads for singers with good voices. J-lo doesn't have an amazing voice like those other singers. She does good with songs like It Ain't Funny, Jenny From the Block, Play, but not with ballads. I'm gonna sell my copy on ebay because it's not worth my money. I expected better from Jennifer. If you are thinking of buying this CD DON'T! Instead get Mariah's Charmbracelet, that's a great album! JLO should definetely stick to fast songs!"
1,Best comedy album of the year!,"If you are ever in a clutch and need to entertain a large crowd of people, just run over to K-Mart, search thru the dollar bin and grab a copy of This is Me...Then by J. Lo, oh I'm sorry, Jennifer Lop.... sorry again, I mean Jenny from the Block!This album will keep you and your friends laughing for hours at end and by the time you reach ""Dear Ben"" get some napkins because somebody will most likely pee themselves!Whoever told Mrs. Affleck she could pull off a song all by herself, without collaborating with Lil' (Insert ANY Name) helping her out should be forced to listen to this album!Somebody who can't keep a marriage together for more than five minutes should stop putting out mediocre albums filled with love songs devoted to her current fiance.This album proves Jen can NOT sing, but it is sure fun listening to her try!"
2,Simply Weak,"Jennifer Lopez's a good actress and have some charisma. She's also beautiful. But nothing more. It's so offensive the fact that she's been called a Mariah Carey's rival. Tommy Mottola can try, but Jennifer will never be a new Mariah. ""Jenny From The Block"", the lead single from the album, is a radio-friendly but a weak hip hop song. The ballads only shows even more her weakness as a singer. The fact is that Lopez's isn't original, unlike Madonna or Mariah, she's only making what has been done.Jennifer Lopez needs more attitude. Lopez's growing but far from greatness."
2,"Where did the real Jenny go? All I can say is ""this is Ben""","I have just listened to my new J-LO cd and am somewhat disappointed. I understand she is in love (yet again) but if this is the new ""Jenny"", I am not sure this will make it. Maybe its one of those cd's where I need to listen to it more, but it is very ""love"" oriented not much of what her fans love about her. She says this is for us, but I can honestly say after buying everything else she has done, this is not for me at all. I guess its nice to just ""chill"" with, but I am very very surprised/disappointed with this cd. I was not looking for a ""Celine Dion "" cd, even Celine's cd was in my opinion better and more upbeat.... sorry Jenny ! I hope Mariah delivers better."
4,J.Lo ROCKED!!!,"I liked this cd so much! I love the song Still, All I have, Jenny From The Block, Again, The One (version2). J.LO did sucha good job on this album u wouldnt be able to believe it. Any pop-fan would luv this cd!!"
3,Ok album,"This is not the best album I have heard, but it is not the worst either. Dear Ben is too mushy. Loving You is the best track on the album because of the beats it incorporates."
1,Mariah Wannabe!! Go back to bad movies and get out of Music,"J-Lo, Jennifer lopez, Jenny..whatever she is calling herself should really use some of the money she makes to pay for my Tylenol medication..I have to use it every time I hear her voice..No offence but who told her that she can sing? I havent heard an album this bad since I listened to the last one she put out!!! JENNY..U ARE JUST FROM THE BLOCK....thats why your music sells...your body...not your talent!"
2,it's ok,"i think we all established that jennifer lopez can not sing to save her life, but this album is better than her previous. a different side of her came out (at least it's not for the worse). the beats are nice if your into the slow mid-tempo style. lyrically it could use some help but all in all it's okay."
3,Terrible...,"This is Jennifer Lopez's best album, but it's still awful. This was her attempt at an R&B album, I think she succeeded with cheesy samplings and cheesy features by LL Cool J and what not. I think that J. Lo needs to continue her dancing and acting and just call the singing quits..."
1,"As Bad as Mariah's ""Charmbracelet""","Another album in a pop music market that bites big time. In no way should you buy ""Charmbrcelet"", you will be be disappointed you wasted your money. On both albums, there is nothing but dead air. Where is the soul, the depth, the deeper meaning!? For great Pop music, look to Australia, Europe & Central America & the Carribean for better music. Get music from real latina vocalists like Judy Torres, Nayobe, Breada K. Starr, Tina B, Cynthia, Safire, & Alisha."
3,Fashion Album,".... This is Me..Then is more of a fashion album than a work of art. By this I mean none of the melodies or lyrics are anything substantial, yet the album as a whole is undeniably chic. What could define the shallow and materialistic culture of 2002 more than ""Jenny from the Block""? There are also some hollow love songs on the album to please fans. Problems aside, this album is a very pleasant, friendly listen. It's good if you're out cruising or at a party and want to feel cool. But don't fool yourself in to thinking this is quality. Undoubtedly, Lopez is capable of a quality (Alive), but until then we have this."
2,J. Who?,This album has a nice flow to it and there is a consistency that is surprising. Unfortunately the singing is horrible. Her voice is weak and off-key through out the whole set. I like the music but the performance has me shutting this one off 2 songs into it.
1,oh I'm really going to keep it real and hurt with the truth,"truth be told, people need to know this album recycles and ruins every good r&b classic to have come out in the 80's. The beats are only good cause they're not original at all they're rip offs from Mary Jane Girls and other artists from that time. J lo's voice is totally weak and stale and gets lost in the production. If you really must get a j lo CD then get j lo from 2001 at least she got it right then and made a half decent album."
2,JLo's downfall.,"O gosh, Jennifer Lopez' career is road kill. This CD, is purely crap. It lacked the spunk of her previous works. This CD is so lovey duvy all about Ben Affleck when I am pretty sure they will break up before getting married. THis CD is full of weak songs, trying to be 70's but ending up as garbage.Even the videos here are getting cheaper. After I'm Glad, maybe JLo thought ""gosh, no ones liking this CD, the video for my next single should be shot cheaply so i won't lose to much money"" so with that, her Baby I luv You video was like a stupid video showing JLo having an epilepsy attack on the bed.After a CRAP album, there came the CRAP stink bomb movie GIGLI. Whats up next? Shes falling apart. Funny. Her career is definitely roadkill."
1,This is me...With Ben,"The title of the new... and highly...anticipated Jennifer Lopez Cd...should be named ""THIS IS ME....WITH BEN""....this is a collection of THE MOST Sappy love songs....you have ever heard....each song (Not including Jenny from the Block) shows just how weak her vocals are...""Jenny from the block"" is the only upbeat Song on this album...This Album is nothing to Dance to....and certainly nothing to clean your house to...."
2,JENNY FROM THE BRONX,""" You Belong To me"" ""Baby I Love U"" ""I'm glad"" ""The One"" are the reason to support this sad try of the latin diva to sing..I hate the others songs like ""Dear Ben"" ( C'mon!!), ""All I Have"",and of course her first single ""Jenny From The Block""(is So fake)....So, Jenny, Try harder or come back home,sis."
4,"A great, classic CD","These days, it's definately difficult to find an album in which you can listen to every song. Generally, an album will have 2 fantastic singles and the rest is, well, filler.Maybe I'm biased because I'm a J.Lo fan, but this album is her best, ever. Yeah, ""J.Lo"" had ""Love Don't Cost A Thing"" and whatnot, but honestly, did you make it past track three? I didn't think so.""This Is Me...Then"" I got when I was in grade 9 and it has remained one of my all time faves to this day. It has a nice slow, but somewhat upbeat flavour to it and you can listen to the entire thing. It's especially nice for something like a dinner party (for a CD) or just relaxing, even driving.Notable tracks (aside from All I Have and Jenny From The Block): Still, Dear Ben, The One (second version I like), Again, Loving You. But really, they're all pretty good.Definately a must have!"
1,"Disgusting, irratating and oh well I have to say anymore!","Oh Dear,Do we have a ridiculous looser in our midst, perhaps I msut be dreaming seeing her on TV nearly a whole time. Anyway, this Album is so sucky. I hate it and it doesn't even suit her voice anyway. Plus she can't even sing like Britney. How can you people call her a ""singer""?. What? Just because of her nice butt?! Oh please! she may look nice but her singing is crap. TOTAL GARBAGE!!! I Tell you. The only songs I actually liked was ""jenny from the block"" and ""still"". I have to give her some credit though. Not everyone that loves someone would actually write a whole album for their beloved. I just think she would come up with a more worth while album rather than an all night haunting spree. Better try next time Jenny. I ""still"" think you can do better!!!"
3,Not Her Best.. Not Her Worst,"There's no denying that Jennifer was not at her best on this album. Its too bland unlike the ""J.Lo"" album which I actually liked. It has Ben Affleck written all over it, and it gets corny after awhile. The first two singles released were pretty wack but it didn't matter cause the CD sold over 3 million copies. The album is definitely a filler album but the most decent tracks would be the first 2 tracks and ""You Belong to Me"". I don't recommend this album get J.Lo instead."
3,ehh?,"2007. (Last day of 2006)I was looking in my box of CD's, looking for something to listen to, something pretty recent. I found this CD and I remembered it. I liked the first song, kinda...liked the song and instantly by the 3rd song I turned it off. It's NOT the most fantastic album and I appalled by the fact that she talks about sex so many times!"
2,Jennifer Lopez is a thief!,"Anybody out there heard the song by the Black Eyed Peas called ""Say Goodbye""? The guy singing at the beginning of Jenny From The Block is the same guy singing in that song. She stole that from them. And also her new hit ""Get Right"" is stolen from a track that Usher recorded but never put on his album. He made the track with a beat just like Jennifer's but it's because she stole it from him. I don't support artists that steal beats or whole verses from other artists' music."
1,Wretchedly horrible....,"After the two semi-good albums, ""J Lo"" and ""J to tha L-O"", this disc reeks in horridness. What happened? I tell you what happened! She fell in love! Eck. Except for the great tune, ""Jenny From The Block"", this whole album can only be described using one word: BAD! I even regretted buying it after I heard it...which is something I rarely do. I try to find the silver lining in most anything, but even my attempts could not come up with any fruitful reason why this album should be rated as anything but awful. Please, save your money...and if you have to buy SOMETHING....Kelis' new disc is a good choice.....but stay away from J LO!"
1,Very poor vocals and bad song writting = a BIG MESS!,"Each one of the Jennifers releases has been less and less interesting. I am so tired of her including rappers on her songs, this is just a gimic to get the song played on radio. Her first album remains her best. Don't waist your time with this album, I did not enjoy even one song on it. Like her acting this CD needs help!"
1,Worst CD Ever,How can people in their right minds call this a Great CD? They are either deaf or hard of hearing. Jennifer Lopez cannot sing to save her life and she is not even that great an actress. Only God knows how she became a STAR. Please do not buy this CD. It's not worth the money.
1,this is bad...realy bad!,"i hate this musik.Jenny was better before...For me she will never been like eurodance stars(dr.alban,masterboy,la bouche-i miss you Mel).songs like ,,all i have'' or,,one''are sooo bad,realy bad songs,it can be only in top-200(200 pos.).,,jenny from the block''is only for 2 stars,but others...no!"
3,boring,the cut jenny from the block is tired already with a boring sample to go with it heard this all before jlo please stick to acting.
1,She transfered her ANACONDA performance to music....,"Actin like a skilled business woman, Jennifer Lopez went to music to take advantage of the ""diva"" phenomenom that is making millions of dollars to them... So, she went for music and was born another talentless ""star"" to plague the music market and make more millions and millions of dollars out of the pockets of naive customers who buy anything the media advertise overwhelmingly... That's all about this ""record""."
2,Dissapointed,"I'm a J.Lo fan and I was excited to buy her new release but not for long... What a dissapointment! Jennifer Lopez being Jennifer Lopez, I thought she would release a better CD. There is no way to distinguish one song from another since they all sound pretty much the same (with the exception of Jenny From the Block and All I Have). YOu would have thought she would have better songs to put on the album! If all her albums will sound like this, then she should just stick ot acting.Anyway, if you're debating whether to buy this or not, listen to the clips available on her website and here and then make up your mind. I was stupid enough to buy before I listened. Don't let yourself make that mistake."
2,This Is Her...Trying To Be Someone Else,"Compared to her other albums, Jennifer Lopez has taken a turn for the worse. When I first heard ""Jenny From Da Block"", I thought that she was trying to hard to justify her reasons from divorcing her ex-husband and getting with Ben Affleck. Now, when I listened to this latest album, I noticed that almost every track had a sampling from someone else's work. The only songs worth listening to are ""Again"", and ""All I Have featuring LL Cool J"". Other than that, I advise you not to waste your money on this album."
2,THIS IS ME....ANNOYED,JENNIFER LOPEZ HAS NEVER BEEN KNOWN FOR HER BIG VOICE OR GREAT SONGS...THIS CD HAS NONE OF THE FAST PACED SONG YOU ARE USED TO FROM HER..JENNY FROM THE BLOCK IS THE ONLY RELATIVELY GOOD SONG ON THERE..DOWNLOAD THAT SINGLE FROM KAZZAA AND LEAVE THE CD AT TOWER RECORDS.
1,J.Lo is a Joke!!!!,"The funny thing about J.Lo is, its a known fact that she can't sing worth a lick. But she is in the top 10 since her album drop. She and Shania are examples of what's wrong with the music industry. You put a pretty girl with a weak voice to sing third grade material, but get a great producer to put the tracks over the top. Of course it doesn't hurt to show how ""sexy"" you are in your videos and pictures. What's even worst is neither J.Lo or Shania cares about growing as artists. They both have other agendas for their music. Its a shame that the generation after me, will never know what ""real"" music is when there's J.Lo and Stankia (Shania) running around and thinking they are hot stuff. Avoid this trash and then burn it."
1,Have you heard Jennifer sing?,"If anyone wants to hear someone with a beautiful voice, this is not the c.d. for you? Jenifer is an example of another overrated peformer. As far as the singing goes, of course she can sing. But, can you honestly say it sounds good? The only reason Jennifer Lopez got a record contract is because she is Jennifer Lopez. If I walked into an record company wth her voice and songs, they would throw me out of the place. Let's stop giving Ms. Lopez credit she doesn't deserve. As far as the sampling goes, se murdered the original songs. Someone with such a lack of talent should not be allowed to sample anything."
1,she's trying to be mariah,"jennifer lopez is trying to be mariah , using rappers in her songs, the ONLY PROBLEM ABOUT HER IS THAT SHE CAN'T SING and obviously mariah songs are a lot better and she is a writter, a producer and an AMAZING SINGER."
1,Bad Album,"Beside that J-Lo cannot sing,yet release another album is just awful. She should stop singing and leave the Selena era behind her. She should stop trying to be something that she is not. I have listen to her latest offering and it is just plain bad. And we wonder why she don't sing live and go on tours"
1,I think this album is overrated,"I LISTENED TO THIS ALBUM , AFTER A FRIEND OF MINE BOUGHT IT YESTERDAY, AND AFTER LISTENING TO A FEW TRACKS I WAS VERY HAPPY I HEARD IT BEFORE I BOUGHT IT! ""JENNY FROM THE BLOCK"",AND DEAR BEN HAVE GREAT BEATS, BUT THATS ABOUT IT!""ALL I HAVE "" A TRACK FEATURING LL COOL J, WOULD SOUND BETTERIF LL HAD DONE IT ALONE. THE ALBUM COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER, IF MORE TIME, AND THOUGHT , HAD BEEN PUT INTO THE LYRICS INSTEAD OF THE BEAT!!! THE ALBUM WILL PROBABLY DO OKAY, BUT I'M NOT SOLD."
1,J to the ellO!,"If ya know what I mean *wink*. Oh yeah, uh sorry, I forgot I was writing a review for this abomination of a CD. Ah, we all know Jenny makes the worst ""music"" on the block. She used to have a little, now she has a lot... yay... I really care too... man, the talent is just STREAMING from this young lady. J.Lo, how low will ya go? Hmm? I'm shocked. Ah, just read my stupid review for Nelly's worthless CD (which, by the way, has upset a lot of 9 year old girls, I think). So, yeah, check that out. I think you'll get the point. It's all the same. See ya."
1,OH MY GOD,"Please, please, PLEASE make this torture end. Never before (with the exceptions of the ""Kidz Bop"" series of albums and Aaron Carter) have I heard a CD of more useless ... than this. Simply put, ""This is me... Then"" is terrible. ...I can't say anything good for it. The worst track has to be ""Dear Ben"". ...I thought my ears were going to start bleeding. This CD now has a good home... as a coaster with all those free AOL discs I get."
2,Not As Good as I thought..,"Man, when I got this Cd for Christmas, I thought it would be awesome, filled with songs that were as good as her other CD, ""J.Lo"". Jennifer never let me down in the past, but this time she did. The only really good songs are the two singles out. Why dont you just download ""Jenny from the Block"" if you like it so much, since that is one of the few good ones. Jennifer, do better cause you are losing fans!"
2,¡Burn It!,"I really do like Jennifer Lopez's music, or so i thought. But this CD very diffrent from her other CD. Almost all the songs are too slow to dance to. Luckly I didnt BUY this, i got it burned from a friend so before you think about buying it, see if one of your friends have it....Holly Rudolph"
1,"boring, boring, boring","First of all, i bought the album because i heard jenny from the block and i think that is a good song.when i put this cd in my cd player and started to listen the first song(still) i thought ""it really [stinks]"", the whole album is soooo boring, today i was trying to listen it , without skip songs, but i just CAN'T, i was listen the fourth song , and i was almost sleeping i think that she's trying to be too much r'n b and the songs all have the same rhythim and definitely she CAN'T SING, SHE'S JUST BOOTIE, then i read the credits( i always do that) and i saw that 8 of 11 songs(without the bonus) have samples from another songs , so that shows that she CAN'T make music without samples."
2,What Happened??,J.Lo has gone really bad it seems nearly all of the songs relate to ben affleck (Her So Called TRUE LOVE). WE DONT CARE ABOUT HIM SO SHE ShouLDNT SING ABOUT HIM. HER PAST ALBUMS WERE REALLY GOOD BUT THIS ONE IS BADDDDD!!!
1,All About Ben!,"If it weren't for ""Jenny from the Block"" this album would be a total waste of money. However, it comes very close. Every other song on the album is a ballad and very much not in J Lo style. It seems as if every ridiculously sappy love song is directed right at Ben....with lyrics such as ""I love how you make love to me, I love how you make me feel"" save your money. Download the MP3 of Jenny from the block you will be much more satisfied and ...richer."
5,THE BEST J.LO ALBUM EVER !!,"THIS IS THE BEST J.LO ALBUM EVER, HER VOICE IT'S AMAZING, MORE STRONG .THE SONGS ARE MORE R&B, SHE WRITE FULL SONGS AND WAS THE EXECUTIVE PRODUCER !!THE BEST SONGS ARE:JENNY FROM THE BLOCKTHE ONEI'M GLADLOVING YOUALL I HAVEYOU BELONG TO ME (in this her voice is amazing)DEAR BEN (one of the best j.lo song that she written)BUT THIS CD GONNA BE RE-RELEASED IN FEBRUARY WITH A REMIX OF ""LOVING YOU"" FEATURING NAS OR JA RULE !"
1,get a band you sell out,do not buy this album. It is bad for your health. Go home and listen to the Allman Brothers Band you musical heathens.
