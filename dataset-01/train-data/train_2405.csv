5,Not for the faint hearted!,A book about serial murder crime scenes and how forensic analyses have lead to psychological profiles that eventually helped to capture the killers.Graphic and hard to put down - even though the subject matter is so shocking!
5,Very cute,"I played this game years ago and was happy when I found it. So I purchased it and was exited to get it...well I received it today and I have to say I'm very disappointed in the seller that I received it from. First off, the listing started that the game was in good condition, well it's not. It is so scratched and it doesn't even play. WTF buyer beware of this seller(Dean Sullo). I seriously want a refund."
4,Great game. Wish it was a bit more open-ended...,"This game is incredibly fun and creative. Unfortunately, it's not as open-ended as I would have liked it to be. There are definite steps you have to take in order to unlock certain things and move the story forward (which, unfortunately, only progresses along the one path).Once you finish the game, it lets you continue, but since you've already achieved most, if not all of your goals, it's mostly about seeing how much money you can collect. This would be fun and interesting if the game designers would have incorporated a plot line involving you, as Chibi Robo, being able to help the family with their debt or something. Unforunately, that's not the case.Overall, this game is great, the graphics and story are fun, and the puzzles are adequately challenging. People looking for a nice, quirky game will enjoy Chibi Robo."
1,Not what I expected based on reviews,"I bought this game for a variety of ages (7-14). Other than my 7 year old saying that ""it's cute"", there really isn't much here for most kids (or adults). The graphics are pretty lame and the sound effects are worse (the characters speak a unique language so kids would have to be readers to understand the game).Bottom line, if you're trying to program your kids to be anal retentive cleaners, maybe this a is a good programming device. Otherwise, I say... stay away.My nieces, nephews and oldest daughter are thinking I'm pretty lame for buying this game.Good luck getting ""Happy Points"" & ""Mullah""."
5,Good picture,Great picture of 3 great comedians and it got here in great shape and in a very timely manner. Thanks.
5,Geox Men's Oxford is good,"This is a good-looking and comfortable shoe.However, I found it is important not to tie it too tightly or it will hurt because its top is higher than most American oxfords. (Tie the knot tight, just don't lace it too tightly.)I was concerned about the European sizing, but my best guess turned out to be fine."
5,"OWN IT, LOVE IT RECOMMEND IT!!!",IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT THEY ADVERTISED AND WAS SHIPPED AND DELIVERED ON TIME...WHAT MORE COULD YOU ASK FOR? WILL BUY FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN IN THE FUTURE.
1,Attractive for a cheap belt,"The belt looks nice, but is very thin and lacks substance. I guess you get what you pay for, in this case an inexpensive belt. My iphone case slides arounds because the belt is so thin!"
3,"Handful of good songs, too expensive","Hey I love sambomaster, but just a couple of their good songs are on here, I would say 4 of them. Some of the other songs on this cd is just really hard to listen to... the guy just screams the whole time. Like most japanese cds it is super expensive so it isn't really worth it... but Sambomaster all the way!"
2,Not great.,"I'm not giving this book a low rating because I love Peter Sellers so much that I can't stand reading anything bad about him. I'm giving it two stars because it is a rather uninspired biography. Sikov's writing style is somewhat annoying. He sometimes seems to be trying to be funny or he makes stupid political statements that are not called for or needed in the book. As far as I can make out his portrayal of Sellers as a complete nut is accurate. My favorite work of Peter Sellers are his Pink Panther films. Too much is written about what the movies Seller's worked on are about, then details of the making of these movies. It was interesting to read what Herbert Lom and Burt Kwouk had to say about him, but all in all it is a sad portrait of a very bizarre person who had a great gift and ability."
3,"Too much career, not enough personal","I really enjoyed this book and I'm becoming a bigger and bigger Sellers fan. Being that I'm 20 everything I watch of his new to me. The book just really really yammered on about every movie and I mean EVERY movie he did. I could have taken a little more personal stuff; more stories of eratic behavior, drug taking, and sex. I got through it quick, but by the end it had worn itself out and I was ready for it to be over. I recomend watching the movie, ""The Life and Death of Peter Sellers"" I really enjoy it."
1,Big disapointment.....very big,"I love Peter Sellers and all his movie work. This book does a great disservice to my memory of him. I really wish I hadn't started to read it. Did not finish the book and have no intention of doing so. Sometimes ""warts"" are best left alone!"
5,"Finally, someone got it right","I'm a HUGE fan of Peter Sellers, so I've read everything I could find on him over the years. But this is the first biography that really captures the comedic genius of Sellers' legendary radio broadcasts and classic film work while delving equally deeply into the actor's tragic personal life. The author unearthed all sorts of tidbits that were new to this fan, too. What really surprised me, though, was how much information was transmitted without bogging down in the usual mire of biographical facts and dates. It's really a lively read that's true to Sellers' spirit. Sikov is a new name to me, but once I finish buying all of Seller's movies on DVD, I'm going to check out his book on Billy Wilder."
3,"Juke Box Hits of 80s brings back memories, but...",The selection of songs is good but could have been better. I would have loved to see some favourites like La Bamba by Los Lobos etc.One of the CD's had the order of songs all jumbled up in the listing.
3,Montoya recordings are great but....,"The description of this two disc set is somewhat misleading. These are vintage Ramon Montaya recordings, but we are lead to believe that, because he was first to divorce flamenco guitar from the vocalists it usually accompanied, these are recordings without vocalists.Oy. So untrue. Most of disc one is indeed Montoya without vocalists. All of Disc Two features vocalists. If you enjoy the highly distinctive flamenco vocal style...then don't hesitate. If, like me, you find it very hard to take after a few minutes, skip this set."
3,A short story that never finds its stride,"In a future where ""death"" has been conquered via cloning and cerebral back-ups, one man struggles to save his beloved Disney World from suspicious innovation.The premise is a bit pedestrian, and the themes of the superficial utopia only shallowly explored (though I suspect that was intentional.) This ""book"" comes across like a short story that the editor had fluffed out to novella length. I suspect it was supposed to be ""funny"" though I never laughed, chuckled, or even smirked.*At best* worth reading once. Although it's ultimately forgettable, it's quick enough that it could make a decent beach read or time-killer if you're stuck on a long flight. I didn't hate it, but it never really grabbed me, either."
3,Cheap way to spend an afternoon.,"All in all, a pretty interesting book.Like the other reviewer noted, it isn't up to par with Snow Crash, but then it is free, isn't it?Think twice about buying the book, as the author has posted it for download on his website."
3,"Eh, not too bad","An interesting idea, with well-thought-out themes underlying the story. The concepts surrounding a ""reputation economy"" are particularly timely considering the emergence of the blogosphere and robust collective filtering and collaboration mechanisms on the Net today. It's a shame that the characters and plot couldn't carry the message particularly well. The thoughts were stronger than the characters that voiced them, and empathy for the protagonist was a bit lacking. This book would have made a good non-fiction essay where the ideas could have been examined in more detail. Props to the author for the innovative concepts and the novel licensing terms."
3,Down and out in the Magic Kingdom,"I purchased this book based on other reviews and I am a big disney fan. I was not impressed. I found it hard to follow and although the background on disney was great I couldn't make heads or tails of half the ""features"" in the future that were discussed."
3,Bland and Shallow,"The characters and conflicts in this story are too ordinary and shallow to make the book interesting.The idea of a reputation system replacing money is interesting enough that if done well, it could overcome the book's other drawbacks. But Doctorow's description of how it works smacks of utopian dreaming. There's too little detail to help the reader guess whether the system is subject to inflation, whether it enables charismatic demagogues to grab more power than under our current system, etc.A more realistic way of evaluating reputation systems would be to look at the attempts we have today, such as the one used to allocate money for academic research, or the one used by Ebay. They produce some benefits, but leave plenty of opportunities for exploitation by jerks."
1,really [weak] story that goes nowhere,"First, the good news about this book. It's a very quick and easy read. Unfortunately that is about the only good thing I can say about it.This story has no plot. The author seems so in love with his vision of a Utopian Networked Future, that he doesn't want to get it dirty with anything so mundane as real conflict. That is fine if you're building a dollhouse, but if you're a reader looking for a good story, look elsewhere. It is hard to care who care who controls DisneyWorld in the future. I kept hoping that the struggle for control of the Magic Kingdom would be about something bigger, more sinister. But if anything, this story is just a snapshot of what one guy hopes the future will look like."
3,"Different, Entertaining, but Predictable","As a recovering Disney Employee (16 years removed) I did immensely enjoy the concept of Future Disney. Cory Doctorow's writing is different and anti-mainstream and for that he gets 3 stars. Character development is good and the reader is rewarded with a great deal of insight into the main leads.Did I mention that I am an avid Mansion fan? So, of course making the Mansion a part of the secondary conflict was, in my opinion, cool.I strongly believe that Doctorow's future work will only get better."
4,A Great Read,"This is a great read. If you dig Jim Munroe or early Neal Stephenson, then Doctorow is your man. A really solid first novel (and that alone is a rarity!)"
1,Over-Hyped,"Unfortunately, I went into reading this book with high hopes. That, I think, led to my ultimate dissatisfaction. Other than whuffle (spelling? - i.e. eBay ratings applied to people, which I hope was meant to comically appear as technology gone awry), there are no really new groundbreaking ideas here. The storyline wasn't all that interesting and the characters were fairly one-dimensional. In the end, I really didn't care what happened to anyone. The book seems to be trying to combine the fantasies of a Disney and SciFi fan. Overall, I just felt it wasn't that interesting of a plot and just not all that well executed. Maybe that's just me though. I wouldn't recommend it unless you're a big Disney fan, and even then, I wouldn't get your hopes up too high."
3,"Wild premise, immature writing.","'Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom' is Cory Doctorow's first science fiction novel. Set around 100 years from now, the main character, Jules, lives in Walt Disney World in Florida. Jules has died a few times and been rebooted from a back-up each time. At Disney World a power play ensues between ""ad-hocs"" over the control of the Hall of Presidents and the Haunted Mansion. Jules has to deal with this while also dealing with the fact that his inner wiring is failing.Doctorow's writing shows signs of a first-time endeavor. It shows undeveloped characters, glaring editorial mistakes, and somewhat adolescent viewpoints. It also shows tiny bits of brilliance. I really enjoyed the premise of Whuffie, the barometer of a person's respectability, which one can use, in a sense, the same way one uses money today; the more Whuffie you have, the better position in life, the nicer living arrangements, etc. For me the ending was unsatisfying. Overall, this book is 3.5 stars."
4,Creative Romp,"I couldn't put this book down! I laughed out loud, gasped, and raised eyebrows in surprise. The author's creative exploration of the reputation economy--and all its implications--are wonderfully appropos in today's world of credit ratings, eBay feedback, & Amazon.com reader reviews--where clout is king.Just as people today become corrupt in the pursuit of wealth, this story explores the temptations that befall a good man who wants to increase his ""whuffie"", or reputation score: the measure of worth in the new economy. Without spoiling the book, I will simply say that this novel is a must-read for anyone who enjoys vieweing life through different lenses.I hope Doctorow writes sequels, as the colorful world of his imagination deserves more exploration. The book is a creative and irreverent romp through socioeconomics, technology, and amusement park crowd control. I highly recommend it!"
2,Concepts better than the plot,"There are some good concepts in this book, but the plot was so flimsy in comparison I ended up not caring. It would have been a much better book with something grander than a power struggle over who manages the Haunted Mansion in Disneyworld."
2,"More Story, Less Concept, Please",Nothing like reading a book that feels like the middle chapter of something. Too many out there concepts that were never explained so it was hard to care about what was happening to the characters or their choices.
3,Muddling About in the Magic Kingdom,"As a longtime fan of [...], it was inevitable that I read something by Cory Doctorow. He must have had the same fantasy of hiding out and living in Disney Land that I had as a boy. That premise hooked me.However, I found this novel to be good but not great, and perhaps not hugely memorable. The premise of ad-hoc factions within the Magic Kingdom is cool, and I really like Doctorow's ideas about a post-death economy that is entirely reputation-based; that seems like a realistic extension of what we are starting to see with digital life.But, despite a few good ideas, I did not find the plot itself or the characters in the story memorable. So, this became, like many sci-fi books, a passable presentation of some cool ideas via serviceable but also forgettable plot and people."
2,Ultimately Unsatisfying.,"This was three stories in one. The first was the story of where technology is headed. This part of the book is fascinating and thought provoking, even if some of the philosophical implications are dismissed too quickly. The second story is just a long-winded, fawning tribute to the Magic Kingdom. I like Disney World as much as anybody, but this just went on much too long without any real point. Finally it is a murder-mystery. While there is a bit of a clever twist here, it is extremely contrived and difficult to follow, and ultimately unsatisfying."
3,An entertaining read with some fascinating concepts,"I think the strength of this novel is that it delivers some interesting concepts to the reader in ways that never require a great deal of exposition. Concepts like a reputation-based economy and ""whuffie"" unfold with ease as the story naturally progresses. In light of Twitter and Facebook and other networking devices that allow people to ""like"" and ""follow"" others, The idea of ""whuffie"" seems particularly prescient, which is always a good trait in speculative fiction.My only complaint is that the story feels a bit too perfunctory, too quick, and the setting overall didn't feel as fleshed out with sensory details as much as it did with concepts."
4,Near-future story about the impact of a global reputation system and immortality,"Cory weaves a thoughtful story about the impact of a reputation system on an immortal society.A thought provoking story about how capitalism can be supplemented with a gift/attention economy.The protagonist is buffeted by the forces of the ""whuffie"" reputation system as he tries to compete against other ""ad-hocs"" in Disneyland. Various ad-hocs took over Disneyland (as well as the rest of the world) after the powers-that-be were ousted due to their inability to keep up with the creativity of self-selected enthusiasts."
1,"Poor, Poor Writing","The thing with Cory is that he's a surprisingly bad writer, and he doesn't seem to know it. His writing is stiff, amateurish, and uninspired, and it sucks the life out of his (somewhat) interesting ideas.I am really not sure what kind of drugs critics are smoking, or what kind of payola may be involved. But regardless of what Entertainment Weekly says, whatever this newspaper or that magazine says, you shouldn't waste your money. Download it for free from Cory's site, read the first page, and look away in disgust -- this book is for people who think Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code is great writing."
3,Well Written; But So What?,"A very interesting basic idea, but so what? Some of the reviews make this sound like a great book. Great books are suppose to be about great things, big ideas, grand topics. This is about taking a bunch of bored immortals fighting over who gets to run an amusement ride.I was looking for a lot more here. Nothing specific, it is well written and it has some interesting ideas, but it's still a trivial topic."
1,It's cotton candy for the mind!,"Pretty cover, catchy name, but no nutritional value. Junk. Or, rather, I should say, ""garbage."" I threw this book in the garbage after 100 pages (the book is a slim 200 pages total, and 12 point type and wiiiiide leading...more like a novella).Science fiction has another Chuck Palahniuk: a writer with great ideas but no writing ability whatsoever. If you don't mind stilted writing, weak narrative, lack of character development, awkward syntax and bad punctuation (who hyphenates ""sea-floor""?) -- then this book is for you.Mr. Doctorow's book reads more like a sketch than a real novel. That's unfortunate, because in the hands of a good writer (or a writer who cared enough to write a good book), the book contains the seeds of an excellent story.If you're looking for futuristic adventure, stick with Gibson, Sterling, Dick and Stephenson."
3,Free SF Reader,"I will admit to being biased, I can't stand Disneyland, so that left me predisposed to dislike this book. As it turned out, that bit wasn't too horrible, but plenty of fetishising of a place you have to pay me to go to.The society parts are interesting, where reputation is everything, and there is no need to work for subsistence as such, and you can check people's reputation on a network as it ebbs and flows.Personality backup is also available, and there is the odd slaying in this book.It also seems a bit like ghosts of ex girlfriends are haunting Doctorow here."
5,Nice and slim,"I've been wanting this book for awhile, because it's very slim and it's translated in the New King James Version. It makes it much easier for me to read. I like the KJV but somestimes the old english gets too thick for me, which causes me to miss the point sometimes. This book is much more portable than my other bibles. I also bought it because it has good references."
2,Blu-ray???,"I really can't see myself paying this much for this set when I already own seasons 1-8, waited on season 9 to see if they put out a complete Blu-Ray collection. Until it comes out like this on Blu-Ray I'll take a pass. If they can go back to '05 and put out a complete Blu set for Lost you'd think they would put the effort in it for Smallville. This just seems rushed to me. Feels like they just wanted to hurry up and have this available by Christmas time this year."
1,no bluray?,sorry WB really no bluray box set? this sucks big time i am not going to waist all that money on standard definition
1,smallville complete series,"ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS I WHAT SMALLVILLE ON BLURAY DVD ASAP SEEN THE EARLY SMALLVILE ON HDNET HD THEY LOOKED ALMOST NEW WON,T BUY THE SD COPY GIVE ME MY BLURAY PLEASE THANKS"
5,Smallville complete series,Great series if you are a Superman fan! This show has it all! Highly recommend it to all ages. The complete set or individual seasons.
5,I love it!!,I am very happy with it. My girlfriend and I have been watching it every night we can. We are both smallville fans and we both love it. it was a great buy. It wasnt to much and it also came on time which is a great thing to me.
4,want it on Blu-Ray!!!,"This was a great show, and am excited that they have already announced a full series box set. While I own the first 7 seasons on dvd, I am contemplating selling those of ebay or craigslist in order to buy this collection. The only thing holding me back from pre-ordering is the fact that it is not available in BLU-RAY. I just bought a PS3. Now that I have one, if I buy a movie or box-set, I want it in Blu-Ray when ever I can.I know that the Smallville has been available in HD for some time, and if they did not shoot all 10 seasons with 1080 resolution they can al teast re-master those seasons so as to include them in a Blu-Ray release of this box set...It really would be a bad bad business decision not to do it."
5,Desperately needs a blu ray set,Almost everyone I know loves this show and would buy the set if it was on blu ray. Most geeks (including myself) only watch blu ray now... it's the reason we all bought expensive HDTVs 5+ years ago.
1,Warning must buy more with this!,Warning...you must buy other cases or something safe to put your DVD's in. It is a horrible designed cardboard sleeve with no protection that is sealed too tight. I've had to tear the cardboard to get DVD's out and it scratches your dvd too. Some have even gotten deep scratches on the first time taking the DVD out causing it to skip. So know you will have to tear the sleeves the DVD's are in and put them in something that won't destroy them.Other than that its great!
1,Bad Design,I got this box set for chrismas and got all the way to 6th season and then had problems with the disc. I'm sorry who ever designed the package was an idiot. This is why I have reverted to downloading shows and movies. It is utterly rediculas to spend 200 dollars on a box set to find a disc so scratched up that it is unable to watch it. Beware before you buy this that chances are you are going to end up with disc that are scratched.
2,Awesome Series,"Smallville is a great series thats not why i give this product review 2 stars it due to the fact that whoever had the idea of packing 64 discs in a tight cardboard book wasn't really thinking. The idea was kinda of cool but that fact every disc gets scratched no matter what, unless you cut each disc out it is inevitable. If you are planning on buying this entire series just buy all the discs separately.Hope this helps!!"
2,The Worst Packaging i ever seen!!!!,"If you want excellent condition discs,dont buy this set for the discs are so tightly lodged in you cant even get them out without scuffing them and when you do get them out the glue from the packaging is stuck to the disc! Its a real nice looking set,but they should have made it like the individual sets with disc snap ins."
4,Waiting for Bluray,"Loved the show, most of the time, disappointed in the release of the entire series on normal DVD. The only way I would buy this complete set is on Bluray.Smallville: The Complete Series"
3,Missing a disc,I had ordered this and session 1 was missing the second disc was kinda disappionted . But everything else was still there
4,Alright...,"I am an avid Smallville fan. When I received this in the mail. The box holding the disk booklets was tore at the closed end, so the booklets slipped through the tear. I used scotch tape to fix that problem, so it wasn't too big of a problem. The booklets' designs were a little confusing. The disks are held tightly in the sleeves, and if you try to hard to get one out, it may become heavily scratched; therefore, I bought a $10 disk case and transferred the entire collection to the disk case. I am fairly satisfied with this purchase because I have all 10 seasons now. So, if you are looking for the show and not the extravagance, this a great space-saving item--compared to having all 10 individual seasons."
2,Problems with this item,"this item was shipped to my PO Box and the box arrived open. Upon further review of the gift, the outside of the series case was damaged and a few of the dvd would skip upon playing. For the price of $150, I would not reccommend this item to others. It was a christmas gift for my wife and she would like to exchange it if possible."
5,LOVE,I gave this to my boyfriend for his birthday. Best gift ever! I love watching this with him! Yay! Woo!
3,Blu-Ray plz - dvds not worth this price,"Awesome series. Got the first 9 seasons on dvd Black Fri. 2010 for 10 dollars each for a total of 90. Would be worth 200 on blu-ray, but not dvd..."
2,No Blu-ray = No Buy,No Blu-ray = No Buy. We have seasons up tell the last one and have been getting the new season on Blu-ray. So why would we back up and get a DVD? We will just get the las season on Blu-ray when it shows up and then maybe replace the older seasons with Blu-ray. Whe somthing like this shows up it is could a double dip and is all about the money Blu-ray will be out before long.
1,Its great if you like scratched up discs out of the box,"Its great if you like scratched up discs out of the box. The design of this box is terrible, for starters it is hard to even remove discs from sleeve as it is. To add insult to injury The discs get scratched automatically from there own case that is suppose to protect them. All it takes is a few views and your disc is rendered unreadable"
4,My problem wasn't with the show,"I was psyched to get the complete series, but that changed when i started to watch season 10... The First disk i placed in the dvd player and it started skipping, and had massive errors. I took the disc out to discover that the item was scratched up. Thinking that it was the one disc, but nope, several of the disc's were damaged."
3,Only on Blu-Ray,"I already own the first 9 reasons on DVD, and will get the 10th. Unless the full collection is released on Blu-Ray, there's no reason for me - and, I suspect, many other Smallville fans - to spend money for this. Give me a full set of Blu-Ray, and I'll gladly spend the money."
3,Must be in Blu-ray,"I would very much like to buy this spectacular item....in Blu-ray. Their is no reason to buy it in standard definition nowadays, it's not worth the price. Extras look good, but I wont buy unless it's in blu-ray."
1,GREAT SHOW !!.. TERRIBLE RELEASE WARNER !!,Why would a fan want to double dip all their dvd sets for these extras ? I am so mad that WARNER BROTHERS would decide to not release a complete BLU RAY set. I have all the dvd's and in this economy I sure as hell am not going to re buy the same discs all over again. They should of included all the extras in the final 10th season dvd set...poor release and a slap in all the faces of the people who dished out $50 for each these season sets in the past!
4,"Braun KF180-WH FlavorSelect 12-Cup Coffeemaker, White",It's quick. Makes about the best coffee in the least of amount of time. Had an early model without the digital clock stuff that lasted about 8 years until manual on/off switch quit.Arrived at my door via UPS in excellent condition. Very satisfied.
2,DISAPPOINTED,"I am very disappointed in the coffee brewed in this coffee maker. It is either too weak or too strong...very difficult to adjust. As for the carafe, I agree with the other reviewers. It broke just by placing it on a drying rack. The coffee maker is not what it's ""cracked up"" to be. My old Krups of 15 yrs. is more reliable and certainly better tasting."
3,Ir is OK,"In my neverending search for a decent coffeemaker, another just ok maker. The top opens from the back, hard to reach and annoying. The unit should be sold with a permanent filter, or, beter yet, the filter should not have that unique niche, so that a universal filter would fit.Coffee itself is decent.It will be interesting to see how long this small appliance lasts."
1,Leaky Coffee Maker,"Upon running a test pot of water through my brand new coffee maker I discovered a water leak coming from the base of the water reservoir level indicator. After further examination I discovered that the plastic nipple that the connecting tube attaches to on the reservoir was cracked. Probably due to poor assembly technique rather than a design flaw. That aside, I was surprised at the amount of steam generated by this coffee maker. It was so great that I had concerns about operating it under my kitchen cabinates for fear of damage. My previous 10 year old Braun never genertated this much steam. Because of my unit being defective and seeing how much steam it generates, I decided to return my maker and will look for another brand."
5,Makes great coffee FAST!!!!,"After having several coffeemakers: Mr Coffee, Proctor Silex, Betty Crocker (UGH), and getting tired of waiting forever for an ""OK"" pot of coffee, we purchased the Braun KF180. What a fantastic coffee maker! It's lightning fast, makes wonderful coffee and has a carafe that's darn near leak proof! I'm looking forward to a long relationship of happy mornings!"
4,Excellent coffee,"The flavor select switch can make even harsh, acidic coffee taste good by setting it to a weaker brew, which two other coffee makers couldn't. Easy to program, no bells and whistles overkill. I like that it filters the water, that it has a water level indicator and auto-brew timer, and that I can program after how many minutes/hours it shuts itself off. To improve it, the filter should be easier to lock into place. Sometimes it takes a few tries. Sometimes it swings back open in the middle of the brewing cycle, and that can get messy. I've tried locking it in gently, slamming it into place, and variations inbetween, but it's unpredictable. Looks locked into place, but may or may not be. Still, fabulous coffee."
1,Decent Coffee maker until you use it a few times...,"We have had nothing but problems with this coffee maker. The coffee leaked out all over the counter on 2 separate occasions. We have to stand over it and watch it to make sure the filter doesn't come loose on its own. The filter does not lock correctly, it is loose and allows the coffee to spill all over the place. Now the pot will only make half of the coffee, it just stops in the middle for some reason. The meter and the carafe are not ""in sync"" so you never know how much water is in it. I found the ""flavor select"" feature to be misleading, it is really just selecting the difference between stronger or weaker coffee. This coffee maker was OK in the beginning, but if you want a coffeemaker that will last, you probably shouldn't buy this one, unless you don't mind replacing it in a about a year."
2,Machine is great - carafe is a nightmare,"I've owned the KF180 for two years. I have been satisfied with the coffee quality and features of the unit. The carafe, however, has made an otherwise positive product experience a negative one. I've had to replace the carafe 4 times due to cracks caused by water temperature differentials. I've owned several other units that use glass carafes and never have had to replace them. I've already spent as much on carafes for the KF180 as I spent on the unit."
1,Carafe too Fragile,"The carafes are definitely not dishwasher safe. We've had two break in the dishwasher (yes, someone is a slow learner). Great coffee maker, but they need a carafe which can take just a little everyday abuse."
1,"Very poor value, buy extra carafes, they break frequently","Very poor value for this coffee maker by Braun. Since Gillette bought Braun, they have subscribed to the razor blade method of making money...lose money on the initial coffee maker order, but make it up on replacement carafes. I have to replace at least one of these per year...sometimes two. I am very careful with hand washing etc. They are just made very, very poorly. Wafer thin glass. I will not buy Braun again due to this philosophy...nice move marketeers!"
2,re: braun KF-180 review,"I have this coffeemaker not worth the price at all, the glass is so thin on the carafe that it broke off in my hand while washing it; had to send away for a replacement which cost...- there are much better coffeemakers on the market - keep shopping around - dont bother w/ this one!"
1,LOOK FOR ANOTHER BRAND - FIRST,It worked fine BUT its biggest drawback it that it is almost imposable to find the water filter for it!!!!!!I would strongly recommend trying another (similer type) FIRST!!!
4,Braun KF180-WH,"BuyHardware was prompt in their response to ""non-stocked"" item. AceHardware never did let me know, but you did for them.Both credits were quickly entered. Only reason I give them a 4 is that neither had the product in stock.I did go to another vendor who had the item in stock and shipped the next day."
4,The best,We have had our Braun for almost 7 years and no matter what new product we have tried we have always pulled out the old FlavorSelect within a few days. It consistently brews the best cup! Now that we really need a new one we will be ordering another one of these. The gold filter is also the best way to go as far as ease of use & impact on flavor.
4,Good Coffee,"I bought this based on a Consumer Reports review. I like strong coffee and keep the flavor adjuster set to strong all the time. Not sure it makes a difference, but coffee tastes fine. I do like the timer feature so coffee is waiting for me in the morning. One caution: coffee maker does not take the flat bottom filters, so the more expensive cone shaped filters are required. I have a reusable gold filter from a previous coffee pot that does work with this pot."
2,Hmm...,"Wow, there are a lot of people who've enjoyed this album to my surprise. They have talent, I will admitt. But aside from the first song there's not much that sticks out for me here. Actually, what truly bugs me is the vocals (for the most part). He often sings like a little girl. And I'm down for female fronted metal, don't get me wrong. But when a metal vocalist sounds like a pussy, it's time to move on. The thing that pisses me off the most is that he DOES have talent but doesn't use it (often)! Rarely will he change it up and then you'd be like ""whoah, that's tight.""I am a fan of Sonata Arctica, Stratovarius, Dream Theater, Primal Fear, Edguy, and other power/progressive metal bands that have beautiful clean vocals, but this album just gays it up.The instrumental is pretty alright, though. Nothing super special but not bad. Like I said, they do have talent, but I just can't get over the frilly vocals, they're so... Disney."
4,Very Good........A Small Band's Best!,"Soundtrack Mind came to my middle school and played for the band students because our band teacher was a friend of Soundtrack Mind. They were very good, I even think they will go big. But,they lacked the energy! I am a big fan of U2, and U2's lead singer Bono can put energy into his music. Still pretty awesomeand their 2x as good live. Buy this album, I guarantee, you will like it!"
4,A Good Book on Pasta,"Not your classic cookbook; dedicated to pasta, this teaches you about the culture around pasta and all its uses. The instructions on how to make pasta should be more detailed. But everything I have cooked from here has been well received."
5,Amazing both in looks and recipes,"Back in 2002, this won an award for best Best Food Photography by The James Beard Foundation and I'll kid you not, this is one stunning, stunning book. It's good enough to leave out as a coffee table book and let people salivate while you're making the dinner!As far as the recipes go, all the ones I've tried have been spot on and I've made time and again.The cooking instructions are clear and, best for those of us who love exacting measurements, list both Metric and Imperial (aka the measurements we use in the US). This helps replicate the recipe exactly as she had intended it.This is not a beginner's cookbook. Many of these ingredients go beyond what you might want to shop for and may take more time than you're willing to devote. That being said, if you love to cook, and love Italian pasta, you can't go wrong with this book."
5,Archery Mechanics,Make sure you buy this DVD and watch it before you spend $100's of dollars on a bow and equipment. The DVD sets out very clearly how to go about choosing not only a bow but all of the basic equipment you will need & haw to set it up. There is a really imformative section on shooting for beginners which I found invaluable. The naration is clear and concise as well as being easy to follow
4,learn archery,a good dvd to start out with. the sound could be better but the info and exhibits are outstanding.
3,Not what we were after,"This DVD is an overview of technical gagets available for compound bows.. moves quickly and may be just what you need. It was, however, not a ""basics of archery skills""that we were after. Not to say it was bad, just not the basics primer we anticipated."
2,Not enough details,This DVD is just a very quick overview of the mechanics and does not go into the details like I was hoping. It was a complete waste of my time and money.
1,bhuibregtse,"Very little information, very poorly presented. The two gentlemen in this video display good mechanical knowledge re: archery, but little knowlege of archery form, and what was presented was mostly outdated, such as the ""bent arm"" technique. The topic segments were very brief, with little detail, and the terminology used was very poorly defined and did not consider the types of questions consumers may have. Nice job on the graphics, but lttle work shown on the presentations themselves. Chalk this video up to a couple of guys trying to make a buck."
5,Good book for Beginners and Professionals alike,"I am a new writer and found this book to be really useful. =-) Here's why: it has over a hundred pages of great synonyms and dialog suggestions and an excellent 'quick reference guide' in the back. I've found these useful for creative writing, and great for when I'm stumped for new synonyms to use!Koz St. Christopher and Victoria have compiled a thorough selection, certain to help new authors and veterans spice up their dialog with great synonym choices... Plus, it has a `quick reference' guide in the back, with all the words included in the over 100+ page book.Use this book in conjunction with the Creative Writer's Phrase Finder by Prestood and you'll find your dialog turned up 100 watts!"
4,"One of the better ""Thriller"" episodes.","""The Terror in Teakwood"" is a typical horror installment of ""Thriller"" in every regard. The horrific and supernatural elements are presented in a matter-of-fact, Jacques-Tourneur fashion, with the primary emphasis placed on telling a good story. Such an approach renders the frightening moments all the more frightening. Whatever happened to this approach?The story is an imaginative variation on ""The Hands of Orlac,"" with a dangerously obsessed pianist stealing the hands of his dead rival from the graveyard. The pianist is played by none other than Guy Rolfe of William Castle's 1961 ""Mr. Sardonicus."" Not the scariest ""Thriller"" episode, by any means, but scary enough."
2,"Very flaky, contrary to Viking's reputation for quality","I've owned various Viking branded memory cards in the past and have always been pleased with their performance, until I purchased this 2 GB CompactFlash card.It's possible that this card works well in other uses, but I found its performance unacceptable as storage for RAW images shot with my Canon Digital Rebel SLR. Anywhere from 1/5 to 1/10 of the images were corrupted, particularly bad in continuous shooting mode. Contrast with my Lexar Media 512 MB and 1 GB cards, which were able to shoot reliably with no corrupt images under the same conditions, and without as much of a lag time as the Viking card (often left waiting 15+ seconds after shooting as few as 3 continuous images while the card to ""recovers"")."
3,Wished this book was bigger,"Very good photos, but could have been better. Measures under 10 x 9 inches. Only 32 pages. I am looking for more detailed books. Hoping that Grummam A-6 Intruder: WarbirdTech Vol 33 has what I want."
4,Worth Buying and Reading,"You may quibble about some of his point ranges but this is a good book with a large number of examples and bidding sequences.Not only does the author address the Negative double, but he discusses hand evaluation and some other bidding.Good value for the money."
1,DVD MISSING IN ACTION,I WAS SENT THE SET WITH NO DVD. VERY DISAPPOINTED. I ORDERED THE ONE WITH THE DVD. CAN THIS PLEASE CORRECTED.
1,Doesn't work with Windows 7,"Tried installing this on a new laptop with Windows 7, the installation program said that it was not compatible and stopped the install."
4,Great Strategy Game but OLD,"It didn't occur to me to look at the dates on the reviews when we ordered this game. We have Windows ME, which the game works on, but didn't work on newer operating systems and even crashed one of grandpa's computers, causing him to comment, ""Wow, this game is reallly old."" Well, that's relative, but once we got it loaded on the ME computer it has provided endless entertainment for our 10-year-old genius and battle strategizer. He figured out the controls and rules quickly. When I sat down to look at it, I couldn't find my troops and gave up! I especially like the different bugle calls b/c I spend most of my time ""listening"" to my son play the game rather than watching/playing. It's wonderful battle history and tactical instruction. Very cool and educational -- from a mom's point of view -- and not bloody or gory, which detracts from the realism but makes it more palatable for younger kids."
4,Great,"The controls are somewhat hard to learn, but it has excellent graphics, ai, and repeat playability."
5,awesome,I have many of Card's tapes from his early years. This is the first time I have bought one of his cds and I am amazed at how awesome he has remained over the years. Scribblings in the Sand is a very touching song and I highly recommend the cd to anyone. The old favorites on the cd differ from their original recordings but lack nothing for entertainment and a drawing close to God.
5,Scribbbling in the Sand,Wht a wonderful song = really adds to the wonder of Jesus' forgiveness towards all us sinners. Thank you Jesus!
1,sucks,"I bought the game knowing my computer covered all the requirements. But when I try to play, the game crashes. I sent the company, and by the looks of their technical support list, it has a lot of problems."
2,don't expect much,"Electronic Arts simply isn't known for putting out good games of this type. Their money seems to be on sports games. Anyway, I got Nox at the bargain bin price. The game is solo action pseudo-rpg. Buy this game if you want to help Amazon out."
4,Nox: An Old School Favorite,"I randomly thought of this game, and when I wanted to buy it, I came here. It was well-priced, and I enjoyed playing this game."
2,"""Better Wait....""","I bought Nox since it looked decent, but was not happy with the game. The reasons are that it brings almost nothing new to RPGs, and does not have enough innovation to keep me playing. Sure it has dynamic lighting, but the pixels are as big as a ultralisks aft orifice. After playing the game for two months I could not understand why some many magazines gave such a average game tons of ""above average"" reviews. Totally linear gameplay combined with a pathetic disney sense of humour make this game a 'bring me back'. Considering the amount of time Westwood took to get Nox to the markets many people who bought the game will soon clear some surplus space of their hard drives since you will not get obsessed with it. Tough Luck Westwood..."
2,Am I missing something?,"After reading rave reviews for this game I was very eager to buy a copy and play it. Unfortunately I found the game did not live up to my expectations. I found Nox to be little more than a mouse ""click fest"". Much too linear and repetitive! In single player mode the protagonist is delivered to an area and the player clicks madly on their mouse until the area is completed. If you are looking for a CRPG I suggest you look at Planescape: Torment or wait for one of the upcoming offerings from Black Isle."
2,It is a good game but doesn't work with WinXP and up,"It is a good game but doesn't work with WinXP and up. If it was actually playable on a current system, this game would have gotten more stars."
5,Brooke is off tha Hook,Brooke Hogan is one off the best singers today! to bad u cant find it in stores! o wel u should buy this cd everything to me & Believe are stand outs !!!! Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
2,Only for the die-hardest of the diehard fans.,"What's weird is that this album does have three completely stellar tracks: ""Motorhead"", ""Iron Horse"" and ""The Train Kept a-Rollin'"". These are absolutely worth having, so get them on No Sleep 'Till Hammersmith**. If you do, you'll not only get much better versions of these three songs, you'll have a great live sampler of early Motorhead. A debut album can be a good place to start for a collection, however the other tracks on Motorhead are nothing like what you'll find right after, on Overkill or Bomber, and the recording and production are as bad as it gets. Even ""Beer Drinkers and Hell Raisers"" on this album just makes me cringe. You should be a rock solid veteran Motorfan before you consider buying this one. **Double check the edition. ""Train Kept a-Rollin'"" comes as a bonus track on the 2001 metal-Is Records edition."
5,Intermediate Robot Building,The only thing I can say is I bought it for my 16 year old grandson and he said it is awesome.
3,Packaging not as shown,"Like the other reviewer, I was expecting grease in a tub with a replaceable lid. Instead I received grease in a long cylinder with a pop-top lid. I'm using this for bicycles, so I'm not using very much at a time and I really wish I had a replaceable lid!"
3,Container was different than what was in the picture,"Picture showed grease in a Jar. I received grese in a slim cartridge that looks like a tall coke can. I kept it because I didn't want to go through the hassle of returning so I kept it... I think ""what you see is what you get"" is very important with internet shopping since the picture is the only way you can judge the product."
4,"saving money, living better and loving it","Since reading this book, I have begun to spend less money and manage my debt. With all the helpful advice in the book, I plan to be free of debt very soon. It is a wonderful book!!!"
5,How to live better on less,"This book pointed out some of my extravagant ways and helped me to re-evaluate how I could live better on less money. I learned of all the places that you really can save money, besides the bigdiscount stores that advertise so much, but are not really saving you as much as Ms. Hartt points out."
4,"Very good, a bit too light for some songs","Sylvia Mcnair has a pure, simple, yet enchanting voice. There is nothing simple about her coloraura though, which is just out of this world. The melisma's and runs are so clear and vocally supported. Like ""Martern aller Arten"", which arouses thoughts of other coloratura roles. The high notes in this piece, which are astonomically high mind you, are the most powerful I've ever heard. Of all pieces, this, unfortuanetly, is the only true one of coloratura proportions. She needs to record more!! I see a possible ""Caro Nome"" or yes even a ""Sempre Libera"". The ""Porgi Amor"" and ""Ach, ich fuhl's"" are both too heavy for Mcnair, this is why I only give four stars. The ""Deh Veni"" and ""Dove Sono"", though, are just perfect for her voice. All-in-all a pretty good CD, but could have been put together a bit better."
3,A better selection should have been considered and recorded,"McNair's light soprano shines in some of the selections on this album, but the Countess and Constanze are not her fach. She may have the notes, but the voice lacks the depth to penetrate these characters. She also sounds a bit bland as her voice 'colours' cannot give enough of an interpretation to the arias"
2,"Thin, strained singing","All of the items on this disc are Mozart warhorses that have been sung with more color and nuance by other sopranos. Some of the items, particularly K369. show the singer straining at high notes, and wavering in her control."
4,Nice light evening music,Maybe it was the nice cool breeze through my window but her voice and Mozart was such a nice touch. Talk about relaxing!This one is a keeper.
2,Ill fitting liner makes this an awkward item,"The plastic liner that keeps the ice insulated and cold was malformed & extremely ill fitting making the item appear poorly crafted. The copper seemed scratched already, perhaps by the coating that is supposed to keep it from tarnishing? I've ordered other copper pieces from Old Dutch & been thrilled with the quality. This was not."
2,Damaged product,The product came in with obvious scratches on the lid. Not worth time/effort to return.
1,This is junk electronics,"I bought this for my 5 year old granddaughter's birthday. Took it to California. Everyone was excited when she opened the package. Turned it on....nothing. After 30 minutes of tinkering, I got it to work. I don't have a clue what caused it to start working. The next day, it didn't work and hasn't worked since. My daughter-in-law is stuck with trying to get it to work. Don't waste your money or your time...this is a loser and a big disappointment."
3,The Story is Confusing,This movie is cute... Elmo is cute... the fairy godperson steals the show... but... Elmo's dream is to dance with the princess... not to marry her... the whole story is about the princess needing to pick a husband now or her and her parents get tossed out of town... I didn't like the whole idea of the forced marriage when Elmo's dream was only to dance with her... not to marry her... and then she asks Elmo to marry her because he was a good dancer? please... what century is this? and then they have an issue because Elmo is only three and he CAN'T marry her... if these were real people this kid would be freaked... Cinderella's dream was to marry the prince... Cinderelmo's dream was to dance with her... they went too far with the forced marriage thing and made a cute movie kinda creepy...
3,Not for my 1 year old....YET!,"My daughter, who just turned 1, has been an Elmo fan for a little while now. This is the only thing with Elmo that she doesn't like. She wouldn't watch more than 5 minutes of it. It's much different from other of his videos. It's more scripted and less animated than his normal segments. I think it would be more popular with 2 or 3 year olds, especially if they're familiar with Cinderella. I loved it and am saving it. I'm sure my daughter will warm to it in the upcoming months."
5,Great present,Got this for my daughter for xmasbut of course I had to watch first. Love this movie it is so cute just don't expect it to be a replica of cinderella expect a cute elmo movie and it fully delivers.
4,Great find. Great movie. Great shipping.,Love this product my son watches it over and over he loves Elmo so much and will recite the lines as if he were in the movie. He is only 2 1/2. The product came quickly at a great shipping cost.
4,Great for toddlers and preschoolers,"Cinderelmo is a great film for toddlers and preschoolers. Kathy Najimi is wonderful as the ""wicked stepmother"". The Sesame Street characters add a different spin to this classic tale (Cinderelmo is a male who wants to go to the ball to meet the princess).The lesson in this video is very clear. You don't have to let others control your life. You can be whatever you want to be!"
2,Don't waste your collective time,"If you are reading this by yourself, chances are you are the parent-type. Let me save you some time. Though this movie is an ""Elmo"" movie, it was very lacking of the red guy. If you want one Elmo movie to play over and over and over, stick with Elmo in Grouchland. It is very similar to Labyrinth (from the '80's and not soo much for the pre-school crowd) which was good for me. It was cute and there were some good songs and decent acting. Also, on a totally ""awwww"" level, I love hearing my 2 year old daughter sing ""Elmo's best friend"". I doubt you'd get a song like that in most of the other films. Cheers!"
3,It is a good fill-in,"This video gets you by in a pinch. The music is passable with the ""human stars"". My son is a Elmo fan but will choose other productions over this one. Like I said, it will get us by in a pinch. I rate it average for a Sesame Workshop Production."
2,Too slow,"on transferring pictures to computer. Yes, it's cheap,got mine for $5 after rebate. It can capture at a rate of about 1.5 fps for up to 20+ pictures before bogging down. By comparison the San Disk Ultra II goes at 1.5 fps up to 45 pictures without slowing. The main problem is it takes a long time to transfer pictures. If you are fine with that, it's a good deal."
2,"Have to agree, poorly made toy.","I expect a better value from Hasbro than this toy has offered. For anyone purchasing a kitchen set, please hit the back key now! This toy is made to fall apart-- it doesn't matter if it is a child or an adult that tries to set it up, it breaks into two pieces and the sink area pops off. It's really too bad, since it would be terrific if the concept and the application had worked out. I will be looking into purchasing a better set for my daughter and son to play with."
2,Don't BUY,"I bought this toy at a gararge sale. I thought it would be fun for my 23 month old, but it is not. She has to struggle just to get it around and it falls apart all the time. On top of that the doors are hard to open. I would suggest just buying a kitchen set ."
2,poor design,"The idea is great, as others have stated. My girls loved the idea of taking the kitchen with them to play. The bad part is it doesn't stay together at all! It constantly falls apart, it won't stay latched together, and it is very frustrating. My almost 4-year-old can't open the oven door by herself--ironic that is the only thing that stays shut!"
4,It's Not Worth the Time or Money,"My daughter go this as a birthday gift. As stated previously, the plates, utensils and pretend food are great. The lack of durability makes it worthless. She gets so mad when it falls apart and constantly has to ask to have it put back together. I too dread the days when she finds it and wants to play with it. Maybe a shopping cart with pretend groceries is a better idea."
3,BIG MISTAKE,"I was thinking to get a big kitchen for my daughter, but decided to try this small, but fun looking portable kitchen set. Big mistake!!! You can't fold it and roll - it just won't stay shut. Once you open it, it's not stable, all the pieces are falling apart.I am glad i still have my receit - it's going back to the store tomorrow. And we will by a big kitchen, as originally planned."
2,Cute idea - needs alittle work,"My 3 year old daughter received as Christmas gift. At first, I thought it was great because of its portability (yes in theory). Unfortunately, in our travels, the unit does not stay securely shut. When you open the unit up it often comes apart rather than swinging open and staying on the hinges. Once you open the unit and the flip out the sink, the sink often falls off. When you try to fold the sink back in, it will not shut unless you place to sink attachment exactly in the basin. My daughter does like playing with it (in two pieces). She likes the little pretend Mac & cheese, plates and utensils but it is more hassle than it should be."
2,Cruddy.. not worth your money,"My 18 month old got this for Christmas from Grandma. It's so poorly made. It was fine that day.. she enjoyed it, but it constantly falls apart. The sink that is supposed to close up just falls off all the time, and my daughter thinks of it more as a vacuum since it is useless when you open it. The door in the fridge is hard to open for a kid her age, but if she was any stronger, she'd have broke the toy by now."
1,sucks,this toy does nothing but fall apart i had to cut the string to the sponge just to let me daughter wash the dishs that never changed colors by the way over all this kitchen sucks
3,Ok but not great,"I bought this toy to save some space, and that is about the only feature I like about the toy. It is awkward to open and keep set up. It falls over a lot when my 2 year old is trying to play with it, and it is a pain to try to keep the sink and the doors on while he is playing. The hinges just don't work well. The colors and the accessories are interesting to my kids, but the toy just isn't easy to play with. They play more with the accessories than with the toy itself."
3,Fold N' Roll Kitchen,"I bought this for my 1 1/2 year old daughter. She really enjoyed playing with the food, plates, & utensils but would get frustrated when the kitchen sink would come off or the oven would come apart from the fridge. We ended up laying it down a lot to lessen her frustration and now it's outside in her playhouse. I wouldn't buy this in replacement of a big kitchen set. It would have gotten better ratings from me if it didn't fall apart so much as my daughter does play with & enjoy it."
1,Very DISAPPOINTING!!,"I bought this for my son since I did not want to buy a Big kitchen for him...and he loves to pull things on wheels. BIG MISTAKE! It fell apart EVERY time he opened it! It does not stand up well and the overall function is very poor! I would not recommend it to anyone. I have it hidden in the back of my closet, because we were both frustrated by it!"
3,Great idea - poor design,"I was estatic at the thought of having a portable kitchen to take to Grandma's or wherever. It's a great size. The overall design is good, but ""push down and pull"" to open the appliances? Are they kidding? Yeah, let's get out the medicine bottles next and try push down and turn. This is not for a 2 year old to do as it frustrates my daughter that she needs my help to open the appliances. I even have trouble with the oven. You have to really push down hard and then pull (on ours). I don't think she will be able to do that one before she outgrows it. Great idea -- needs work."
3,Great idea but has some flaws,"I bought this for my daughter's second birthday. She was really excited to get it and didn't want to play with anything else. However, she got frustrated because it doesn't stand up on its own. It just isn't shaped right to stand up by itself with a little kid playing with it. She got frustrated with the fridge door because it was hard to open and the little flip out sink keeps popping off. Overall it is a great idea. I loved the idea that it was compact and didn't take up a bunch of room and could be stored. They just need to make it more user friendly for the really small kids who are just getting into this sort of thing. She still plays with it, she just has gotten to where she will prop it against something. I would say it is cute and very well made. Comes with some cute accessories."
2,If you've got enough space buy a more durable kitchen set,"I bought this for my daughter when she was 2. She's almost 3 now and she still plays with it occasionally, but the 3 main pieces fall apart every time she uses it. The whole thing is very flimsy and gets knocked over all the time. We are short on space in our house so I liked the compact size and the wheels on this product. I purchased it despite negative reviews. My daughter does enjoy playing with it when it's in one piece, but she gets frustrated with it quickly."
2,"Great concept, horrible execution","I bought this for my daughter's fifth birthday after seeing it in a magazine. She had been begging me for a kitchen, but I told her no as we didn't have the space for it. When I saw this toy, I thought what a great compromise,a kitchen for her and space for me! Boy was I wrong! It will not stay together at all. Everytime she opens it, I have to snap it together for her. She has had it for less than two weeks and hates it now. On the upside my 16 month old son loves carting it around so it's not a total waste of money. For christmas, I'm just going to make room and get a regular kitchen set for her."
2,don't buy,i brought this toy for my daughter she is 2 years old. It would be fun if it didn't fall apart. It falls over very easy and the parts fall off very easy. Every time she opens the toy it comes apart. She would like to play with it but she can't because everything comes apart. Same your money!
4,Could Have Been a Great Toy,My 2 yr. old and 5 yr. old cousin loved this toy...until they finally got too frustrated with everything falling off/apart. It is a nice idea...I wish someone would make a more durable kitchen this size in a portable design...
1,Terrible!,"My daughter received this for Christmas. We were very disappointed! She is 18 months old and loved pulling it behind her, but when it came time to open it up it was all downhill....It was hard for her to open because the latch was pretty tight. Once I would get it open for her, she would get frustrated because the drawers are hard to open. You have to press on the drawer and then pull. The product was not sturdy at all. It would constantly tip over. When it would fall, the sink would fall off, and the fridge and stove pieces would fall apart. We ended up taking it back because of the poor construction and durability. I refuse to have to put a toy back together over and over again!I wonder if Playskool every tested this product with children before rolling it out on the market. It is a shame because it is a cute idea and my daughter seemed to really be interested in it."
2,Frustrating toy,Big waste of money!! I bought this for my twin daughters for a small kitchen since we are limited on space. It has got to be one of the most frustrating toys they have. It is constantly coming apart and falling over. None of the pieces will stay connected. You can't glue them in place because then you would not be able to fold it up. I say save your money and invest in something more sturdy.
2,don't like it,My baby takes it appart and I spend a lot of time putting it together every day. Actullay pieces fall appart all the time. I regret that I got it.
3,Not as unique as it looks!,"I first saw this portable kitchen when it first came out and decided to buy it for my daughter who is 20 mths. When I got home and started checking it out, I noticed that when you try to fold the sink; the brush gets in the way and you have to hold it in order to get it shut all the way. Also, when my daughter tries to play with it, it always falls over and has to be propped against a wall. It's great, if you want a play kitchen that is both small and afforable."
1,Very Poorly made toy !!,"I bought this toy for my 22 month old daughter thinking it would save space of having a big kitchen set up, but still give her the play of a kitchen. So she loved it, until it continuously fell apart, and we have hard wood floors, and every time she would try to pull the oven door open(which is hard to do,even for me) it would slip and fall backwards and fall into 10 million pieces. It was a great concept but very poorly made, in my opinion. We will be purchasing a big kitchen for her 2nd birthday. I would not reccomend buying this product."
1,I want my money back,I thought this would be a great toy. I have found it is very very frustrating! It falls over. I thought it would have something to help the stability - seeing that it is made for kids. I think saving your money for any other kitchen play toy will be the best use of your hard earned cash. It looks cool - but does not stand up in real life play time.
2,Flimsy terrible toy that only frustrates,This toy is poorly constructed and constantly falls apart. My toddler was very excited to have this toy but any interaction with it would end in tears and frustration. The kitchen doesn't stand up very well; the sink falls off as do other parts.
1,READ THIS REVIEW-dont buy this!,"OK- I had seen this in both Wal-mart and Target and thought it was adorable and knew my 2 1/2 year old daughter would just love it. I went to amazon.com and read all the reviews, all of which I read stated how hard it was for little children to open the stove, and fridge- also that it tipped over all the time. I went back and forth on buying it, and finally did purchase it anyway deciding to brave the reviews...well guess what? When she opened it on Christmas morning, it tipped over within seconds, she could not open any of the doors by herself so was very frustrated to say the least. The thing comes apart in 3 pieces, does not stay together at all! I didnt listen to the other reviews...Listen to this one! Don't buy it! This toy was a great idea or would have been if Playskool worked out a few things first! Don't waste your time with this prduct because you will waste your time putting it together over and over, and picking it up over and over!"
4,Pleasantly Surprised by how good this was.,We were pleasantly surprised how good this was...funny and in line with the first movie! This is one we would watch again.
4,solid 4 stars...and even more,"Enjoyed this movie. Good plot, good morals and good acting. In my opinion it does not repeat first one's plot at all, just the same family few years later. it stands on its own good feet. Will become our favourite as much as the first one."
3,Like the original better,"It was ok, not too terribly corny. It had some funny moments but nothing comes close to the original.I would suggest renting before you buy."
1,Not worth the time,"I thought this would be as funny as the first movie. My expectations might have been too high. In my opinion, it's the kind of movie you won't regret watching as long as you don't pay for it and had nothing better to do with your time."
2,Painful,"I absolutely love Christmas Story, and I try really hard not to be a movie snob. This is over acted for sure. And, the costume/hair of Ralph is ridiculous. Someone should have fixed his hair color. I don't get that.The movie does have a good moral story, and if you haven't seen the first one, it's okay. Kids will like it.I think on it's own, it's okay. And, if you like any kind of Christmas movie, it's worth having. But, I don't think I can handle a 24-hour playback like the original."
5,Great!!!,Way better then i thought it was gonna be. Especially for a straight to video sequal made thirty years later. It has the sam magic as the first one:) i recommend this movie!
4,ho ho ho,"im a christmas story nut ! 7 differ leg lamps ..countless rr bb guns... bunny suit .. autographs , hell i even have a Pink Nightmare Tattoo! ... when i saw this was coming out i had very very very little hopes of anything . but i tell ya it aint half bad . so go into to with idea of haveing some fun . it is bob clarks original , not close ... but it is enjoyable if ya allow your self just to have some fun . it blows christmas vacation 2 out of the water , i know that aint saying much . at least they didnt try to remake the original! merry christmas ra ra ra ra ra .... ra ra ra ra"
3,"Not great, but worth watching","If you compare this to the classic, you would be disappointed every time, because it's not the classic!! It's still pretty funny though, there are a couple good laughs. And Daniel Stern is great as the father"
2,Hard to follow a classic...,We powered our way through this movie...wanted to stop after 20 minutes. To forced and contrived--trying to cash in on the first movie's gags.
3,Good but you won't ever beat the original!,This movie was better than I thought it would be. It was entertaining but you can't beat the original. This probably shouldn't have been made with such a high bar set by the first movie.
2,A Poor Reflection,"I tried to be as open-minded as I could watching this. The idea and intention may have been honorable paying homage to the original; however, the writing is as corney as its script. It reminds me of how Saturday Night Live may have written it for a Holiday skit."
2,dull,Dull but still a bit funny as a family classic for families. I will not rewatch this movie for a few years.
4,Nice follow up.,Nice follow-up to A Christmas Story. Doesn't have the original charm and laughs but watch with an open mind for an enjoyable experience.
3,It had some good parts,"Didn't like Daniel stern in it, and the dialogue for the dad was portrayed much more unintelligent as the first one. I would not watch again as I do the heartwarming and classic first one!"
3,Ok movie,"Definitely was not as good as the first Christmas Story. I think just because it is such a watched movie (A Christmas Story), it was a little hard to watch with different actors. Had some funny parts. Sort of thought that the parents were acting ""too hard"" to sound like the original parents."
3,A little over the top.,"While the original movie relies on comedic understatement, this movie takes an in your face over the top approach. We enjoyed it, but there's nothing like the original."
1,Waste of $$,Don't was your money!! Horrible. They should have never made a second one!! Don't waste you time watching this movie.
2,This movie was horrible,Would not recommend at all. They should have never attempted to create a sequal to such a classic holiday film.
1,STICK WITH THE ORIGINAL...,"WELL...AFTER THE FIRST TEN MINUTES AND HEARING THE CURSE ""SOB"" 5 TIMES....I SAID ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. I TURNED THE MOVIE OFF AND TOSSED IT INTO THE GARBAGE. AND THAT'S THAT..."
1,Why?,"Why on earth would anyone make Christmas Story 2? What was wrong with the original? That movie is a classic, how dare anyone try to profit from it! I know I won't be buying it!"
1,Terrible!!,I would not reccommend this movie. This movie is nothing like A Christmas Story 1.... A total waste of money!
2,Not anything like the first!,This movie was a disappointed. They should have just wrote the movie as an entirely different movie basis because we went into the movie with the expectation of it being like the first and it was nothing like it. Not that funny either.
1,First one was way better,Kids are all grown up from the first one. I just personally didn't care for it but loved the 1st. One.
2,Should not have done a sequal,"This movie is a lousy sequal. Do not spoil A Christmas Story by watching this. On its own it is cheesy, but in comparison it plain stinks. Ralphies best Christmas he ever had or WOULD EVER have was the red ryder gun, NOT his first car. Come on people!!"
2,Not good,this movie was lame and Boring. I loved the first and this one doesn't compare . Ralph little brother is only funny character.
1,OMG,NOTHING COMPARE TO THE FIRST CHRISTMAS STORY .. I SHOULD HAVE REVIEW IT ON LINE BEFORE I PAID 17.00 FOR IT.. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS
3,"Definitely not the original, but still funny in it's own right.","First off, let me say that my family is one of the ones that watches ""24 hours of a Christmas Story"" that runs on one of the major networks on Christmas day. So, to say that we like ""A Christmas Story"" may be an understatement. To that end, this movie is in fact not the first one. In fact, my expectations for this movie were really low. The premise of the story is that Ralphie is now a teenager and instead of the ""Red Ryder BB Gun"" he is now in pursuit of a car.The movie does a good job of portraying Ralphie as a teenager, and all of the woes that come along with it. However, it seems to be lacking in several areas. Even though the movie itself is fun and whimsical it isn't nearly as entertaining as the first. In my opinion, you can enjoy this movie independently of the original, but if you try and compare the two it isn't as likely.I will give this movie 3 stars. It is enjoyable, but slightly underwhelming if compared to the first one."
3,A nice family film.,"Fans of , A Christmas Story, might find it amusing. Ralphies aren't going to ""Shoot their eye out"" over this one."
3,RALPHIE REDUX,"A sequel to A CHRISTMAS STORY is really doomed from the start. The original has become a Christmas classic, the trials of young Ralphie and his quest for the Red Ryder BB gun indelibly etched in cinematic history.Nat Kauldan's (sp) script doesn't have the whimsical charm of creator Jean Shepherd and Daniel Stern and Stacey Travis are pale replacements for Darren McGavin and Melinda Dillon. Braeden Lemasters is okay as 15 yr old Ralphie but Peter Billingsley is the quintessential embodiment of Ralphie.Your best bet is to catch the original on TBS yearly marathon."
2,It's OK,"Most ""Sequel Movies"" are made because the original was very good. As such, they usually suffer by comparison and Christmas Story 2 is no exception. It this were a stand alone movie I probably would have enjoyed it more."
2,What a shame!!!!,Very disappointed with this movie. How could you take an american classic and ruin the sequel. There were so many other ways this movie could have been made. Sorry to say this will not be watched every Christmas like the first Christmas story.
3,A Christmas Story 2,I absolutely loved the first movie. This one was okay but not as good as i expected it to be.
3,Not a good sequel!!,"It kept the family entertained, barely. It had its funny points and it had a good lesson but it dragged some."
3,christmas story 2,Nothing can beat the first one. Liked to of seen the original actors but done when first film came out.
1,I tried to like this movie but could not.,"I tried not to expect the same greatness as the original, but found it hard not to compare these characters with their original counter parts. The actors had zero screen presence, a big contrast to the original movie where every character seemed to steal the scene. Nearly every joke was a rehashing of the original, but this time flat and predictable with no flavor. This movie had so much potential but they blew it. I was left disappointed and wanted my money back."
3,Not as great as I thought,Sequels never really make a great movie and they really I think should of just left it alone. Overall it was a cute movie.
4,interesting....,I thought it was cute ... dont go in thinking its going to be the same as the frist one a sure disappointment..It is a cute movie to just to watch and yes i admit i will watch again from time to time. maybe it will grow on you .i had to watch because the frist one was just so awesome and my curiosity sparked a interest glad i did though.
4,Cute,"Very different from the first, but still really cute. Trying a little bit too hard to be what the first one was, but hey, did they even know that one was going to be a classic when they made it? Scenery is great, if you have an old soul like me. :-)"
3,It's okay!,"This is a far cry for the Christmas classic; it was just ok for not funny kind of weird at times. The little boy that plays Ralph’s baby brother was the only thing cute about this move. All I can say is it was ok, not the worst thing I have seen. I cannot see myself sitting to watching this each year, as I do with the classic Christmas Story."
2,Really Bad,"This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I watched the whole thing, so I gave it 2 stars rather than 1. It is horribly overacted and the story is a caracature of the original...like a poor copy of the original. There was nothing clever or new...very predictable and just a waste of time."
1,Stupid,"Terrible stick with the 1st one only, the dad is corny and they made ralphie like 5 years older then original but left randy young lol"
3,A Little more of the original,"I liked it. I've been a fan of Christmas Story 1 for years. This movie followings in the same style and chessy-ness.They could have written a fresher story. There were too many repeats or references to the original. If you a fan, you still need to watch this."
3,Not as good as the first,But defintetley worth at least one watch. I know I always had a wonder of what would happen if that movie had a sequel.
2,Disappointing,"If you think this is a good sequel to the original Christmas Story, forget it. Slow, boring and not entertaining."
1,Not worth the time.,"This movie was a terrible sequel to the original. Nothing new, they are just older. No real point, just made to make a buck."
1,Made for TV debacle,"I was hoping after reading some of the positive reviews I would find some pleasure in watching this, nope. Not even close to the feeling of the original, the production value was bad, the over acting was bad and it completely relied on using old stunts from the 1st movie. Don't waste your money like I did."
1,Christmas Story II,This was a very bad remake. Movie was terrible. Not worth the money. Somethings are better when left alone. The original was so much better.
5,Worth the time & money!,"I was reluctant about this movie after all of the negative reviews. First, this movie is not rated for children! If the cursing did not offend in the first one, why rant about it in the second one?! Secondly, there are FEW movies that top an original, that being said, our teen son and our grown children in their 20's enjoyed this movie. We laughed as well as them at many parts of the movie. This was a nice Christmas Eve movie for us! Lastly, I would definitely buy this movie again!!It's hard to please everyone all the time.... we had 6 people watching this and we all loved it!"
2,Not worthy of the title.,It was clear from the beginning that this was one of those low budget direct to DVD titles. This resembled more of a low budget Nickelodeon movie and wasn't worthy as a sequel to one of the best family comedies of all-time.
4,Great Movie,A very cute holiday movie!! I don't think it will become a holiday classic like the original but it was a cute movie with a good story!
1,Did not like it,Couldn't watch it for more than ten minutes it was so bad. I did not like it at all. ...
3,This Movie has Heart,"I must admit I was beyond skeptical, if not horrified, when I saw that there was going to be a sequel to the beloved classic film, A Christmas Story. After watching it with an open mind, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that it was NOT awful. There are definitely a few cringe worthy scenes in the movie. Flick getting stuck again being the most awkward. However, the creators of this film stay pretty true to the original look and feel of the movie. The characters are portrayed alright, a little over the top (Daniel Stern), but you can tell they all studied their parts well. As someone who has been watching the original since Christmas of 1992, after 20 years, it was nice to see what, hypothetically, happened with the Parker's after Ralphie falls asleep Christmas night on good old Cleveland Street. It's not trying to recreate the original. It never could. I don't think anything can!"
2,"It's ok, I guess....","I wouldn't call this film a classic compared to the original ""A Christmas Story"" but I think it might become a classic in a whole different light. I give credit to the creators of this film for putting forth a seroius effort to make this close to the original. It doesn't have the same magic as the original though. This might become a classic for the younger generation. I was born in the mid-80s so the original is classic to me. It a generational thing, really. You be the judge guys."
3,Should be rated PG13 because of Language!,Kind of a dumb movie for adults. It attracted us only because of the sequel thing. Kids liked it (sort of) but you know things are bad when they cover their ears because of the language.
2,Stick with the original and you won't be disappointed,"My family loves ""A Christmas Story"". When I heard there was going to be a sequel released directly to DVD, I knew I had to buy it. When looking at the description on Amazon, I noticed several negative reviews. Upon reading them, I noticed some were written even before the DVD was released, so I figured we would give the movie a chance. Boy, were we disappointed! None of us liked it. The actors tried too hard to be like the original characters and, bottom line, it was poor acting. Some scenes, while a little funny, were too far-fetched to be believable. And considering it was a family film, the profanity was unacceptable. Unlike the original movie where the father was always humorously spouting off obscenities (and you really couldn't understand them), the swearing here seemed forced. Save yourself time and money. Don't bother buying or even renting this movie; stick with the original and you won't be disappointed."
4,I enjoyed it!,"They really stayed close to The Christmas Story. Is it a spectacular movie? No not at all. Is it a movie worth the watch? Yes indeed and I really think you have to be a true blue fan of Christmas Story to find the heart to enjoy this movie. I think they did a wonderful job of making this movie for the ""TODAY"" viewers. It carries a lot of heart to it. I even got tears in my eyes. It is corny, caring Christmas classic. If you go in with no expectation you will enjoy and it will just make you want to watch the Christmas Story! I am not going to NIT PICK and over anaylize it all - I just truly enjoyed it. It is how you are suppose to be with movies. I don't think anyone involved in the Classic would be offended, if anything they would be honored! :) I recommend it!"
4,A very decent sequel!,"As a major fan of the first ""A Christmas Story"" I was very reticent about a sequel especially so many years from the first. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and story line of this story. Daniel Stern does a good job filling the shoes of Darren M. Braeden Lemasters is a very believable 16 yo Ralph (good job Braeden!) Nate Maulid as the Narrator is as close to Jean Shepard's Adult Ralphie as one could hope. The story as well as acting are a very good match to the original (which did not do well at the Box Office itself). I have read reviews from people who refuse to see #2 which I find idiotic and anyone who heeds to such reviewers is truly missing out on another fun and nostalgic Holiday classic!"
3,A Christmas Story 2,Difficult to meet the standards of the original but a good follow up. It's just like how child actors a cute and then they grow up.
3,Nothing too special,Sent this to my Brother for one of his xmas gifts....he loves the original christmas story and wanted this one too.......well after the whole family watched it he texted me and said it was nothing special and could have been done much better. But for the price it was worth a try
3,Ok but wont make the yearly Christmas must see list.,"Had some good lines but no where near as many as the original. Something strange about the movie, the characters just didn't seem to fit the time period or something. Also it was very hard to accept the new characters especially the father. It was worth seeing one time tough just to see."
2,Original is Best,This was a gift for a true fan of the original movie. This was cute but not as fun as the original movie.
3,EHH....,"I was excited to see a sequel to my favorite Christmas movie. If you hadn't seen the first one, you would probably LOVE this, but as a sequel, it seemed to try a little too hard to bring back the old spark. Although the actors did a good enough job, it just didn't have the appeal of the first movie. don't get me wrong.. it was a very fun movie. it just dulls in comparison to the first one. It's difficult not to compare the two because there are so many references to part one. This is ok as a rental, but I wouldn't buy it."
2,Not like the original,Bottom line they tried too hard to jam old jokes in the movie even where they don't fit. I'm glad I rented this instead of buying it
2,Not impressed,Not impressed especially since I HAVE to type so many words as s requirement to rate this video. So not impressed
3,ok movie,Has some really funny moments. do not buy it if you are expecting anything like the orginal. Lots of puns etc.
1,This is a SIN!!!,"Let me just say, that there are certain movies that should not be remade and there are movies that no way should there be a sequel. This movie is just bad, there is nothing else you can say. Warner Brothers should be ashamed of themselves for attempting to reboot probably one of the BEST Christmas movies ever. And for Danile Stern, Darren McGavin has to be spinning in his grave after that W C Fileds performance of The Old Man. I give it one star and and a 0 on a scale from 1-10."
2,"wow, where to begin","i wasted 5 bucks renting this on amazon and it wasnt worth it. wish i could get it back, but we suffered through it. ok there were a couple of places that were funny, but being a movie that came out this year the picture itself was terrible. fake backgrounds, the worst acting in decades (i've seen barney the dinosaur episodes with better acting in it), and too many references to the original movie.this should not have been called A Christmas Story 2, it does a complete injustice to the original which will live forever in our hearts"
1,christmas story 2,"nothing to say......,,, cant say enough about it on here or there far as that matter goes ...there is just nothing i can say about it."
3,Ehh!!,Not as good as the original.tried to be like the first but wasn't. Not the same caliber as the original.
2,To be expected....,"The kids liked it, but it was what I expected. You just can't make a second on a classic movie!"
3,The original was better,"Its cute, I know it's supposed to be part 2. But it seemed kind of dumb and they need to get better actors"
1,Foul Language!!!,"This movie was shockingly foul. This isn't a family story. The language is deplorable. The first movie suggested the father's profanity, while this one lets loose. Terrible acting, raunchy language, we couldn't even finish it. Tomorrow it goes back!"
1,"""IT'S A KLINKER""","I gave this movie a 1 star rating only because I couldn't give it zero. This is the worst movie I have ever seen. It shouldn't be allowed to share the same name as a classic like A christmas story. Horrible acting, and stupid and predictable story line. In the immortal words of ""the old man"", ""IT'S A KLINKER""."
3,Cute but falls apart rather quickly,"This bag is really cute and I certainly stood out on campus. I got a lot of compliments on it. However, the should strap broke after about 9 months of use. Thankfully, my dad was able to fix it, but everytime I use it now I'm really nervous its going to break again. To be fair, I put a lot in it - heavy books, my laptop, etc - but I still felt it should have held up to the challenge. It also only has enough room on the inside for one textbook, a notebook, and your laptop. So if you're planning on going from class to class with this and you need to carry multiple books, I wouldn't go for this."
4,My son loves this game.,We bought this game for my son after he meet another child with it at summer camp. He played non-stop for 2 weeks straight.
5,Awsome !,I'm a HUGE Kirby fan so I got it for Christmas.I love it!I think its cool how you have to explore to find items and stuf.It's also fun to play as as different colors.it's the best of gba Ive ever seen
5,great game,"i got this game for my bday. my sister tries to train the others kirbys. they are too dumb. my file is at 97%. i cant get this certain treasure chest. good for kids who need to get used to using the controls. it can gt boring, though.very fun!:) call me A."
4,puzeling but good,This game is a long game so it keeps me buisy. Some of the levels are hard others not.
4,Truth,"I did enjoyed TC Carson's Truth CD. The songs were original and his voice ranges are wounderful. I personally would like T.C. to record ""My Funny Valentine"" and to sing some songs of that nature. T.C. you will go far. God has bless you with a velvet voice."
2,I thought this was MILO,"Wasn't TC on Living Single? My only question is where's Max? couldn't TC and Latifah pull some Duo album? that would hit the charts faster than that UNITY did. SET OFF THE ALBUM. At least he got rid of Overton, moved to the HUGHLIES, what a career move"
1,O.K.,One of the worst moves that an already mediocre actor can make is to try and go from music to screen and vice versa. Need I say more?
4,Real Music!,"Great album. Full of soulful sounds and great instrumental backgrounds. If you like Eryka Badu and Al Jarreau you'll like this album. He has a deep soulful voice that creates moods of love, romance and play. This is what real music sounds like!"
3,Cute toy chest!,"Hinge malfunctioned - We wrote to the company and received a new one right away. Their customer service was right on the ball. There wasn't even a phone call needed....They handled our issue all through e-mail. We're still having issues with te hinge, but we don't need it until our daughter is much older.Although we experienced trouble with this item, it's still really cute and would look really nice with any room decor. It looks even better in person and fits lots of toys!"
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"I also ignored the other reviews and purchased this box. The weight of the lid pulled the hinge right out of the wood, which didn't install too easily in the first place. The press board was too weak to drill new holes, so you're left with a heavy lid that slams down if not held. We'll be taking this back to the store tomorrow. Sadly, it looked really cute in the nursery but my daughter only recently started walking and showing an interest in it, so the hinge problem didn't become obvious for a while. If I could give zero stars, I would!"
4,Great Size and Easy to Put Together!,"I was a little nervous ordering this based on a couple of the reviews, but this is truly a GREAT little toy chest! It arrived to me undamaged and will all hardware enclosed. The directions were VERY easy to follow (especially for someone used to putting IKEA furniture together!)-All of the pieces were labeled so there was no question what went where... The only loss of a 5th star was that the paint job could've been a little better-I noticed that the edges had a ""peeled & painted over"" look to them, but not severe enough to worry about. A great deal for the money."
1,Disappointed and Frustrated,"I bought this toy box for my daughter and it came without instructions, which made it difficult to put together. Even so, I managed to figure it out. However, the safety hinge didn't work. The spring in the hinge literally had no give, therefore, the lid wouldn't close no matter what we did. The wood sounded as though it was going to snap. Since we didn't have instructions, my husband and I tried putting the spring on in every way possible. I had to return the toy box because there was clearly something severely wrong with the hinge. Needless to say, I was very disappointed and frustrated."
1,Very dangerous and unsafe toybox! Please do not buy!,"When we first bought this toy box, it was perfect. Until the lid suddently slammed down on the head and arm of my 3 year old, and onto the arm of my 6 month old daughter. They were both injured by this toybox when the ""safety"" (ha!) hinge gaveout without warning. If you own this toybox, PLEASE remove the lids for your childs protection. If you are considering purchasing this toybox, please don't!"
3,Problem with Safety Hinge,"The box is cute, but the safety hinge doesn't really stay open. You have to press it in to lock it and it closes really fast if it's bumped."
3,Safety hinge problem,"The toy box is a beautiful easy to assemble toy box, HOWEVER, it's biggest flaw is its much advertised safety hinge. We had the toy box all built and the last piece is the safety hinge. We put it on and tried to shut the lid--the bottom part of the hinge came out. We tried again, and again it pulled itself out. Since we received the toy box as a present, we decided to visit the local Babies R' Us and sure enough the two display models also had the safety hinge on, but pulled out at the bottom.We have since gone out and bought a slide hinge to install. The chest is nice, but be prepared to go to your local hardware store to buy a new hinge."
1,extremely unsafe!,"I bought it despite the reviews. It looks great... my daughter has gotten hurt so many times w/ it, we put it in basement for storage. THe top lifts and falls without any resistance. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,AWFUL TOY BOX,"We bought this toy chest to store a few toys in. I saw it in the store and both samples that were out were broken, that should have been a sign, but I thought it was cute. Anyway my husband spent some time putting it together and the minute it was put together it broke when we tried to close the top. Also the back of it did not stay on we had to nail it in. I do not reccomend this toy chest at all, it is a waste of money."
1,It stinks..............literally,"I love the look of this toy chest and was pleased when I received it off of my registry. However when my husband and I were putting it together I was overwhelmed by the paint fumes. The smell was so bad I made my husband open up the windows and air out the room. Needless to say I may have been hypersensitive to smells because of the pregnancy, but it took 2 days before the chest stopped stinking up the nursery. Also the safety hinge is a joke. It does not work and ripped right out of the wood as soon as I opened it to place toys inside."
3,Comprehensive but tedious,"My main interests are Social Psychology so I am somewhat biased. This book is extremely well regarded in the U.K. and indeed it is a very good reference for Cognitive Psychology. Where it falls down is in the writing style. There is unfortunately a view on this side of the pond that if you write in an engaging and reader friendly way that you are guilty of dumbing down. Consequently, U.K. textbook writers frequently have a humourless and inacessible writing style. When this applied to a subject which is difficult for many people to grasp then the results can be stupifying. This is coupled here with a very dense typeface and a lack of illustrations. I think when complex experiments involving colour stimuli would benefit from good quality colour images. Here we have a book which is extrmeley uninviting. A little investment in improved visuals would be benficial."
3,Durable and easy to clean,Just as my title says. The brushes are durable and easy to clean. Worth the money! Great for painting small model car parts.
2,"Not the best, but does the trick","For crude pain jobs or cheap models these will work well. They are rather course but will get the job done. You may see some brush strokes or even have a bristle come off while painting. If your not wanting to spend alot of money on a high quality brush, these will do the trick. Not a BAD brush, just not great."
5,Great addition to a CD collection.,This cd contains some of the best Choral selections I have ever heard. Rich long tones and wonderful compositions. Great for the Easter Season.
5,My favorite Russian Choral Music,"This is my favorite choral chant CD's. Although the orchestration in the background is not exactly kosher, I think it brings it into the 21st century with a enhanced richness and proper flair. Sit back, cut off the lights, light a candle, and Dream through a cold winter's night."
5,Fabulous singing,"We recently heard the St. Petersburg Chamber Choir in The Netherlands, and were amazed by their quality. Incredible piano's (barely audible, but beautiful!) and fortes (loud and impressive!). On this CD we hear many of the same songs, in the same quality! Makes us happy. Please go on."
4,A Classic Sim game,"Sim Farm is a great simulation for people who love to buy, sell, manage, and predict outcomes. In this game, you are in charge of a agricultural plantation, growing crops, raising livestock, playing the market, and developing the land. You have to watch the weather carefully. And, like all the famous sim games, it has the exciting disasters. For this game's day, the graphics are good. Right now, though, they aren't top of the line.I definetly recommend SimFarm for everyone who enjoys a good, classic game."
3,Kiwi perspective,"Yes sheep really ARE that stupid! not a bad game in its day, Having grown up on a farm i can relate to it better as well, very addictive game like the other sims & dont give up on the crop duster it is easy when you know how to land it! (with a bit of trial & error I might add!)"
2,A little confusing and somewhat silly,"My friend lent me this game knowing that I have an interest in--but almost no practical knowledge of--farming, and I was totally overjoyed that such a game exists. But I'm the type of person who prefers to sit down and just start playing the game. For some reason, however, I just can't figure it out. Besides that, the game is obviously intended to be ""simple fun"" kind of entertainment. I'd prefer something more technical where a person can try their luck at really managing a farm. I'm not a big computer game person, so if such a game exists, I really don't know; but my guess is that I'm one of very few people who would like to play such a game, and therefore doesn't."
1,I reckon this here game's only for hillbillies,"phh, what an insult to PC gaming.... the only people who would enjoy something like THIS are hicks out in the sticks of Montana or South DakotaHORRIBLE HORRIBLE graphics(I know the game was made in the early 90s,, but there were games out then that had better graphics than THIS!), and well, the animals claim that they ""cant reach the food"" when it's right next to them! and then eventually they break out of their pen and eat your crops, or just wander off till they die...also, the spray plane is 6 thousand bucks,,, and you can't even land it.... and it keeps saying that your crops need to be sprayed cause of bugs and then when you spray them they get toxicated... yep.... ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ....like I said, only buy this game if you live in the following states: North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Alabamba, or West Virginia"
3,Good for two weeks,"This is a good game, but it gets boring after a while. In the beginning, it's kind of exciting, because you have to make sure you have enough money for fields, machinery, irrigation, etc. But after a while, you're just doing the same thing over and over again, and it can really get boring. It's neat when the house on the screen gets bigger, but it happens rarely, so by the time it happens for the fourth time or so, you get really bored, and it's time for a new computer game. The good part about the game (or, for some people, the bad part) is that it's really addictive, and you won't want to do anything else. It's the kind of game that you play for a week or so, get bored, and then maybe play it again in a couple of months. It gets boring too fast, so it's probably best to play it until you get bored, and then give it (or sell it) to someone else."
3,Semi-Good Sim Game,"At first, I'd reccommend you to try building your own farm from scratch, even if its a failure, just so you get a feel for the game. Then try a scenario. The graphics are pretty bad on this one and its sorta hard to understand at first, but if you are up for the challenge of a farm then try out this game. It gets boring quickly so be sure to purchase this one from the bargain bin. Try new things to keep gameplay interesting, like terrible conditions, having animals or buying more and more."
1,Bad Game,"This game is boring! And your cropduster ALWAYS crashes. No controls. It just flys around 'till it runs out of gas. Don't be fooled, it's not worth the money!"
1,sim farm dissapointment,"This was purchased as a gift. For the price I paid I thought it was a ""new"" game. It was not only a used game but beause of something done to it it can't be loaded. Since I can't find the packing slip I'm out over $50 and my son in law got screwed out of a gift"
1,Not Compatible on newer Mac computers,"This game only works on older apple computers - it needs a ""classic"" operating system apparently, and the newer mac laptops etc don't have that. So even thought I'm sure it's a good game, do not purchase it if you have a mac computer bought in the last few years. It will not work, and then you're stuck with a $50 game that you'll only get $25 back for because you had to open to package to test it out to learn all of this in the first place...!"
5,Daughter Aqquires mom's old obsession!,"I was utterly delighted to see that Hasbro finally released the My Little Ponies with body styles very close to the originals. I have since bought my daughter nine different ponies, including Moondancer! She is, I think, one of the most beautiful ponies. The little radio is really neat, since it actually plays music. I definately like the accessories for My Little Pony (as opposed to other toys that seem to have nothing but cheap paper accessories). A+++++++++++++"
2,Interesting but not ABB,"This is an interesting experiment to emulate the ABB. These are all classic ABB songs. However, it is not the ABB and does not even come close. Some performances are rather flat, they lack this southern spririt, and southern rock! The good thing is it just shows how great ABB was in the good days."
2,Synbat,To far out there. Yes an okay mystery but it crosses the line with even being remotely real. I expect my readings to at least have a potential for being real.
3,If you are hard up for a book!,This book I would consider as a 'fill-in' book - one that you read when you have nothing else to read on a wet day or on vacation and there is nothing to do.It was sort of okay but nothing I would rant and rave about.If it is wet and you are bored silly - maybe this book could make the day go a bit ...slower!
4,SynbatVery readable,Very readable. Quick paced. Enough technical stuff to add lots of credibility. The plot was believable and could happen or maybe it has already happened. I had to get more of Mr Mayer's books after reading Synbat. David Potter
1,Not Pfaltzgraff quality,"Within the first two weeks, one cup and one bowl cracked. Very poor craftsmanship. Not what you would expect at all from Pfaltzgraff."
5,Are you serious?,"Okay I've had this game for a few years now and still play it on occassion. It is that good of a game.In fact in my opinion its the one flight sim worth playing. But I was looking here on amazon and two seller's were selling Freespace 2 for 149.00! Yeah it's a good game but is it that good. do people really pay that much for this game? If they do, or you are reading this and are interesting in buying it I have a copy that I can part with for a price and it won't be 150 bucks (100 sounds good). Contactme if you are interested"
5,Fantastic!,"Look, there's nothing I can say that can do this game justice. Saying that the graphics are groundbreaking, the sound is excellent, and that it has an honest-to-<insert deity> plot that would actually make a fairly decent SF novel just doesn't capture the magnitude of this game.Go to the Interplay website and download the playable demo. Afterwards, pick your jaw up off of the floor so that you can buy the full version."
4,"Still great game, but come on, not worth $70-150!!!","Like so many people reviewing this game, I heard all the raving about this game. I heard some comparisons to the Wing Commander legacy, and at that point, had to get it. I was a huge Wing Command fan back in its day (1989??). But after looking around, was totally discouraged. People asking over a hundred bones for used copies. However, there is a way to get this game for free. I'm not gonna say where to look, but its out there...available in one big file. (Hint: Google Hint: Abandonware) I've been playing it the last couple days, and yeah, its grrrreat, but I'm glad I didnt spend $70 for it. Go find it and maybe the price will drop to a reasonable level."
3,"Ok, but not the best","The book has usefull information, for example the steps you should follow in washing your dog or cat, but is very vague in the cuts for specific breeds. This book is perfect as an introduction for a more complete guide to grooming pets."
4,General Health & Grooming for Pets,The book provides information on many of the various ailments that can aflict your pets and gives some general advice. It guided me to many of the issues of both of our dogs.
4,Latino Love songs,"Would like to order another, but you have been out of stock. Please advise when you have it in stock."
5,WOW!,"Well, reading the other reviews, I see I won't have much of anything new to add to the praise this outstanding collection is getting. I just had to express how wonderful it all is.Bach's music is so enigmatic and mystical, and the complexity of a Bach fugue is a joy to try and decipher.Yet many also have memorable melodies, some sublime, some pronounced, all developed with perfect precision and harmony, never too long or too brief. Furthermore, many of these works are INTENSE. Whoever says Bach wasn't a man of passion the likes of Beethoven hasn't heard these epic pieces.I suppose the only negative thing to comment on is that, seeing how these works were recorded using analog technology, occasionally on some of the quieter pieces there is a notable hissing noise, but all in all, 95% of the time, recording quality is excellent.Anyway, this is complex,beautiful,and often earth shaking music that will enhance your life."
4,It was such an improvement,"Some of the books before this one seemed to be dragging on and on, but this book picked right up. Especially with the opening lines. It was very coincidental that I was writing an essay on Camus' and his existentialist perspective. I really liked how Gaia was enjoying herself with Paul, although all the miscommunication between Sam and Gaia was getting irritating. I love Ed, and it is so great that he is walking more and more. Heather shows her true colors and how she was the real cause of all of Ed's problems. I am so glad that was revealed. I can't wait until the next book."
5,I don't see Pascal's talent diminishing at all,"This book was great. For those of you who don't think it's up to her ""usual standard"", you try writing like that. She keeps you on the edge of your seat, and even though I had my doubts about this one at first, she's managed to make each book a ""gasper"", as they say. Kudos to Ms. Pascal- and I'll keep an eye open for 'Flee' to make sure it doesn't ""pass me by""!"
3,Another book like this and I'm giving up on 'Fearless'.,"I'm sick of Gia always thinking of herself. She's getting really self-centered. And the books are the same old crap. Maybe you could think of a new plot...like maybe in stead of her running FROM someone...she might run TO someone. I mean, she needs to let people in. I didn't like the plot or the ending. It didn't go anywhere. Oh, wow! Sam is ONCE AGAIN in trouble, and ONCE AGAIN Gia doesn't care. Her 'Uncle Oliver' is back. How did he get back? Her dad ran away. Geez...her life seems to get uglier and uglier. Hopefully Fearless Number 17 is better."
4,"I'll say it once, I'll say it a million times","Gaia and Ed should just dump the losers they're chasing after and GET WITH EACH OTHER! Ed likes that Gaia's real towards him...good. Gaia likes that Ed's the only one that hasn't abandoned her (and he's a HECK of a lot smarter than Sam Moon!!)...good. I've felt this way from the very beginning. I would love to see them two together.The book Naked was okay. Same things happen that were in the first few books, only you hate Heather & Sam & Uncle Oliver more."
2,All heroes must die.,"Lets be honest here... F11 sold out by there 2nd album under their new name. No one complained because the album was stellar, but it was a complete 180 turn from where they were before. There is definately something to be said for a group maturing, but they are actually on a steady decline. If your a Finger Eleven fan, do yourself a favor and stop buying them after Greyest of Bule Skies."
1,Seems like most bands change for the worst...,"Most rock bands start off real good and then drastically change their music causing crappy albums like this. This album compared to greyest of blue skies sucks REAL bad. Other artists that are following this trend are Taproot, Staind, Creed, and some others. Why cant more bands be like Disturbed and just make good music every album they made like on their first album?"
1,What??,Rock is Dead! I going to put these super songs in my Ipod and see if my shadow will disco dance to it.
3,"Not the worst, some great Riffs","I thought this was better than their last release. The raw power of their music shines through, but the lyrics are somewhat elementary. If you like hard music this album is for you."
2,A great departure,"I rarely take the time to write a review for an item, but I was so surprised when I heard this cd I felt compelled to write a warning. As another reviewer notes, this album is nothing like their previous work. You can call it ""reinvention"" or ""selling out"" or pressure from their label: it's all the same. This cd is chock full of ridiculous poppy backbeats and obvious, trite lyrics. If this cd tried any harder to gain mass appeal, they would have had to change the title to ""Radio Friendly.""For all the effort made to boilerplate this album, there isn't a single song I genuinely liked. There are a few places where it seems like the old Finger Eleven is going to come out and temper the new, top40 Finger Eleven, but it never quite makes it. Needless to say, I'm very disappointed."
2,Just lacking something...,"It's not that this album doesn't sound like anything they've done previously - I enjoy creativity and variety in everything I listen to. However, this album is just really lacking something and seems very derivative, especially when you consider how interesting their other three efforts were. All the soul seems to have gone out of this band, they're going through the motions but it's just not registering or breaking through. Let's hope the next album has something worth listening to."
2,No more paralyzers?,"I love Paralyzer.. it has a harder sound to it which I was hoping to hear on the rest of the album. Unfortunately, I only liked the first track and found the rest to be a bit of a disappointment. Seems like ""Paralyzer"" should have been done by Disturbed. The only reason I gave the album a 2 was because it has one song I can't get enough of. Otherwise, it's a zero. Generic and poor lyrics = radio friendly. Not what I'm looking for."
2,F11 lost their edge,"So these guys are getting older, more mature, and lighter. This wasn't a huge problem with their last album, which is WAY lighter than their previous efforts and a great collection of songs. However, the boys from Canada seem to be moving away from rock altogether. Don't get me wrong, the album has a few good songs on it, but it also has an equal amount of filler tracks, a problem they never experienced on their first three records."
2,2 songs i like,"This was an okay album only 2 songs i like and thats falling on and paralyzer the rest did'nt interest me, so this was an okay album."
2,never meet expectations,"All I know is that finger eleven made one of the best albums ever in 2000 greyest of blue skies. IN 2003 i was hoping for the same but hugely let down even though the masses when retarded for this band. it was ok, and then even more let down when i saw them open for Cold in dallas. NOw they release this. i did not buy it but my buddy did becasue he really liked the last cd. Personally i see this album of 3 or 4 hits if that even. stay way or be let down!!! this band will never please you when you want them too."
4,Finger Eleven Rocks Out,"Finger Eleven has always been a great Canadian band, and Them Vs You Vs Me is a great example of their work. The songs all have a different sound to them from Sense of a Spark to Easy Life to Paralyzer. This is a great CD and I hope they keep coming."
3,Finger Eleven - Them vs. You vs. Me,"I love the first song on this album, which is why I ordered it. It is getting a lot of radio play. The rest of the album, I hoped would be just as great. It's not, but it is still good."
1,Not so good ...,"I've listened to this album many times, and just can't get into it. It's very generic, and sounds like everything else nowadays on the radio. If you're looking for something better, try Chevelle's newest album, or even old Iron Maiden. In my opinion, Finger Eleven is a waste of your precious listening time."
4,what's wrong?,"I don't get why everyone hates cd's that are ""radio friendly""! Why is a cd or song not any good if it's mainstream/radio friendly???? Who cares... if it's good music, it's good music. Everyone seems to think it has to be some kind of underground, outlaw stuff to be any good. Whatever!"
2,Buy Greyest of Blue Skies Instead,"If you want to hear Finger Eleven at their absolute best you have to listen to ""Greyest of Blue Skies"". There were so many modern rock songs on that cd that should have been radio release hits it's not even funny. They never got the exposure they deserved when ""Greyest of Blue Skies"" was out. Their first cd under the name Finger Eleven was ""Tip"" and it was great as well. I caught them live with CREED back in the ""Greyest..."" days and they were great. I just don't care for the new sound that these guys have developed. They are a super band but I am stuck on the ""Greyest of Blue Skies"" cd!!!! It's totally different than anything else they have done."
3,A different Finger Eleven,"The sound has mellowed out much since the last 2 ablums. The vocals are still great, I miss the edgier guitar rifs."
1,BORROW A FRIEND'S!!!,"I have, with this purchase, bought 3 dogs in the past month. I fell for A song, (Paralyzer) bought what I thought would be a rockin' album only to find emo in every direction!!!! (Saliva's Blood Stained Love Story - for Ladies and Gentlemen - and Linkin Park's Minutes to Midnight - for Bleed it out - were the other 2 dogs.)DO NOT buy this album without sampling to all the tracks...go to your local Borders if you have to!! Save your money!!! I wish I had."
1,"One hit wonder, as everyone should know","The only valid reason to buy this disc is for ""Paralyzer""; it's the one semi-original, decent tune on the entire disc, and if you're familiar with how the mainstream record industry works, you'll know that's all you should expect. They'll milk one song, push the record on the strength of that given song ad nauseum until not even the one song is listenable, then move on to the next victim. The only reason this album as a whole would be a good buy is if you're expecting extremely substandard, dime a dozen mainstream rock that's as uninspired and unoriginal as the thousands of other sound-alike bands polluting the airwaves at this very moment."
5,You can't waste $$ on great music!,"This CD has many great New Age type songs that can be very relaxing or very upbeat and full of energy. The performances are wonderful, and the music is incredible! I will back up this CD 100%!"
4,It's really good!! My daughter loves it!!!,"I bought this for my daughter when she was 3 months old... She really love it !!...It's was very difficult make her to sleep... but the first day that we bought this I turn on the toy on her crib, and when the toy turn off I came to the crib and she was REALLY sleeping....I recommend to use this just one time a day, and when your daughter (son) is sleepy...but if you use it more than 1 time a day, BELIEVE ME, she or he will get tired of it quickly. The only reason that I didn't put the 5 stars is because the images have poor quality, and now that my daughter is 7 1/2 months, she doesnt like it that much!!"
4,It works great and is very lovely but....,This crib companion is great and really keeps my baby busy for quite a few minuets. I however did experience some problems with attaching it to my baby's crib since my baby's crib is a sleigh style crib it was harder to attach due to the thickness in size.
2,Eats batteries,"This crib toy has several nice features and options, but it goes through batteries like crazy. We need to replace the batteries every two or three days. I don't know if we got a defective item, or if they are all like that. I have emailed the company, but have not yet received a reply."
2,"Ok at first, batteries don't last long","I bought this for my little girl, she loved it. Unfortunately, the batteries only lasted 2 days the first time. I thought I would give it another shot, and put fresh batteries in. They lasted 10 days. I was really disappointed, because it seems like such a great toy and helped her fall asleep. I am going to try something else."
3,eats batteries like crazy!,"This is a cute toy but if you buy it, I would recommend buying 4 C rechargeable batteries because they only last for about a week."
2,Looks Attractive but very unsoothing......,"This looked very attractive toy to me and I couldn't wait to buy but.........the dreamscapes soother has not been attractive enough for my 3 month-old. Being a toy for the crib ,it does not have enough distance for little eyes to notice the moving object so clearly, only thing he enjoyed was the one and only sung poetry ""Twinkle twinkle"", the rest was different music. The story was good but with the dying batteries the same scenes kept repeating.. Requires bulky batteries which wont last for more than a week.Also after a few months we had to remove this as it kept hurting him since he started to move around in the crib."
3,Baby loves it but be ready to buy batteries,"Our baby really enjoyed looking at the screen and listening to the music and stories, however it just seems to drain batteries very quickly."
3,drains batteries fast!!,"My daughter absolutely loves the dreamscapes soother....the only problem is it sucks all the life out of a set of brand new batteries in about 10 days. With batteries being about $5 a pack, it gets very expensive to keep this toy operational."
5,"Great Product, Poor Company","I absolutely love this product, but the Leapfrog Company is not at all family-friendly. My daughter is reliant on the Soother to fall asleep. I had difficulty with the turning mechanism and the batteries running down too quickly. I called Leapfrog and they told me that in order to get a replacement (I've used this for only 2 months), I would have to mail in the product, at my expense, and they'd send a new one in 10 days. This is not at all helpful to me, since my daughter needs it to sleep. They let me know this is standard policy for their company and there is no way around it. This product is no only available online, so I had to pay to replace it myself. I would recommend this product to anyone, but I will never again buy an item from Leapfrog company."
4,so far so good,I have this and the fisher price wonders aquarium. My son likes both. I do like it that the music plays longer on this one. He listens to the little breeze story and then after that it plays about 10-15 minutes of soothing music. I also like the volume option and the option to turn off the light if I want. My son is 5 months and just now starting to sleep in his crib. This sooths him.
4,Great for sleepy time,I wanted this toy because I'm no good at singing or telling stories. I have had my child yet but my nephew loves it (7 months). He staresat the pictures and snuggles up and is off to sleep. The story is very sweet. But the voice could be quieter.
1,Have to change the battery too often,"I do not know why so many people give it a 5 star. I've been using the soother for almost a year now. It was ok at the beginning, but when she can turn it on an off, it drains out the battery too often. We end up changing battery almost every week - not only wasting money but also causing us trouble. My daughter is so attach to it and got annoyed when battery is running out. We have to rush to change the battery and put her back to sleep. Drama happens every few days and it's driving us crazy.If I know what's going to happen, I would choose a simpler sleeping assistent toy for her."
4,Still a great soother...,"Sure, it eats up batteries like crazy, but we have figured out a way to save the batteries, while having my son still enjoy the music; we turned off the sights and left on the sounds! He loves the lullabies and it totally puts him to sleep, but he never really paid much attention to the pictures. My son has had this since he was born (he is now 2 1/2 months) and is already accustomed to the music, we figure that in a few months he will soon discover the pictures portion of the Dreamscapes and be just as happy with it! We still love this soother, and maybe we'll love it even more when he gets older."
2,1st time mom,This is a big waste of money. I bought this to help soothe my little one to sleep but he would put his fingers up to touch the light and kept on turning it off. The play switch is right at the bottom. It also uses up quite a bit of batteries. Don't bother buying this item!
1,"Not happy, returned toy. Not worth it!","The idea is nice, but it drained a fresh batch of batteries within a couple of days and not that much use. Features were not that great either. Totally not worth it in my opinion. Very dissapointed.I have tried other products by LeapFrog and have been very impressed by them, not sure what happened here."
4,One Problem,My 2 year old Loves this toy. The only problem i have with it is Its a battery sucker I have to change the batteries every 4 days! And that gets old!
2,Poor image quality,"We love LeapFrog products and thought we couldn't go wrong with this crib toy...however the image quality of the scrolling pictures is murky at best, not at all vibrant or appealing. We returned and opted for the Fisher Price Flutterby."
3,Uses a ton of batteries,"My daughter enjoyed it, however - it uses batteries monthly and if you forget to turn it to off, you are spending a fortune on batteries. I wouldn't recommend it unless you purchase rechargeable batteries."
2,not up to par,"I am a faithful Leap Frog buyer. I own and love all of their products...except this one. We brought the first one home and after one day the thing must have shorted out or something because it would drain brand new batteries in a matter of minutes. So that was returned and on the second one we brought home, the screen stopped moving after two days. This toy was not getting strenuous or unusual use, it was strapped to the crib, so I cannot explain the malfunctions. I do know I returned it and got the trusty aquarium one I had with my first two children. I am extremely disappointed as I have never experienced any trouble with any other Leap Frog product. Hopefully they will work out the quirks and bring us yet another wonderful toy in the near future."
4,Bedtime Routine Must,"This has been a great addition to our bedtime routine. I like that you can have the light on or off. There are only 2 problems that I have noticed. First, the big red play button is very easy for my daughter to push, which is nice in the middle of the night when she wakes up, but sometimes she just turns it on and off over and over again. Second, the batteries don't seem to last as long as they do in other leap frog products."
2,Not what I thought - SCARED my baby!,"This isn't for all babies. My baby loves to watch TV so I was hoping that this would keep his interest and lull him to sleep while he was in the crib. The first time I turned it on he screamed and cried. He was terrified! I tried holding him while he got used to it, but he just hates it. Some babies may not mind, but I think the the voice is pretty scary. The lights dim and it has good volume control, but the quality of the picture is not what I expected from Leap Frog. Buy with caution."
4,"Great item, my son LOVES it!","My son is almost three and still has this next to his big boy bed. He loves to see the animals pass and it's works great as a nightlight until he falls asleep. The button is big enough so that he can find it it even in the dark to turn it back on. BIG DOWNFALL: this thing eats batteries (4 C's) like no other toy we own. On average they last about 3 weeks. We finally got rechargables but those last less, about 2 weeks, but at least we dont have to keep buying new ones. Overall if you dont mind changing batteries every 3 weeks you little one will love this!!!"
2,I should have bought two aquariums!,"i bought this thinking it would be so great. First of all it did not fit on the end of the crib so we had to put it on the back side and at the time we still had the matress up high, we thought that would work until in the middle of the night my baby rolled into it and turned it on! uhggggg what a nightmare. It woke me and both babies up ( dad slept thought it all of course ). So the next day I took it out of the crib and put it away. Now the boys are 11 months old and the matress is lowered so I put it up again. My other baby has the aquarium one in his crib and has a blast with it in the mornings and my other baby just stares at him because his toy is out of batteries. Also the aquarium one has little buttons that they can play with and the soother doesnt. So even when the other one is out of batteries it can still be played with."
1,this is awful!!!,The light on this is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too bright. There is no way to adjust the light. The music sounds funny. The woman signing has a scarey voice. I returned this item immediately. It is not worth the money at all. I've told people at stores that I've seen with this item to not bother.
3,Eats the Batteries,"I got this as a gift for my second son, it matches his nursery and the other leapfrog toys in my house have been a hit. The soother is great, the music, the stories. You can turn off the light and just have the music playing, I love it. The only downfall is this thing eats the batteries! I have tried turning it off when not using and I still have to change the batteries every few weeks.... in my opinion, not worth it. I bought a Fisher Price aquarium crib toy for my first son and it was great for 2 years. I think I have to get that one again."
1,"A Leapfrog fan, but I hate this soother!","I have several other Leapfrog items and love them, but this one had to go back. The music selection is good, but the quality isn't there. My biggest complaint is that every time you turn it on, the light comes on and starts the ""slideshow"" which is run by a very noisy motor. You can turn off the slideshow once it's on, but it's still enough noise to startle my sleepy baby. My older child had a crib toy that also had a motor such as this for another purpose, but was nowhere near as loud. This proved to be too much of a distraction for me and my child, so we are now off to find a new crib toy/soother."
2,Not what I expected from Leap Frog,We have the Leap Frog Discovery Ball and Baby Tad. Our little guy loves both of them. The Baby Tad nighttime sequence with the blinking lights and music is pretty good unfortunately 6 minutes it is too short. I thought that the Dreamscapes Soother would be of the same quality but it is NOT. The sound is of poor quality. The light does not dim as the instructions state. The brightness is too much of a distraction for baby to fall asleep.
5,Dreamscapes soother is a dream for my 2 1/2 month old,The play button is big enough that my child can use his feet to turn it on. He listens to the music and then falls back asleep. I love that it has a volume control too. That way it is not blaring through the monitor at 1:00 am! I would recomend this toy to anyone with a child. My child stays in his crib from 9 pm until 5 am and can quietly entertain himself.Additional comment:My son is now 10 months old we still love this toy. I would HIGHLY recommend purchasing rechargeable C Batteries. I waited to buy them and have gone through around 48 C Batteries. That is around $40 in batteries. It would not take long for the batteries and charger to pay for itself.
3,A Lifesaver,I have not found anything else that puts my 6 week old son to sleep so relaxed. He is so peaceful wen watching and listening to the dreamscapes soother. In his almost most irritable moments he is calmed by the soft voice.
5,Velvet Voice,"My parents had ON THE WAY UP when I was a kid of 6. (My dad had the hots for AM - who didn't? - so our beautiful high tech ""hi-fi"" played this album a lot.) If there could ber a female version of Elvis - she's it. Her voice is like velvet. Moon River, Could It Be?, His Ring and all of the mellow tunes on this CD are like silk. Sweet, smoothe and syrupy but VERY SEXY."
1,NEVER BUY THESE!!!,"I paid full price for these at Best Buy, and I have already returned one pair to the manufacturer that literally fell to pieces in my hands for no reason. Now my second pair has abruptly stopped working too; the sound cut out for no reason in one ear. They were working fine 24 hours ago when I was wearing them in bed to watch something on my computer. I put them on my desk, put them on last night to wear them out of the house, and all of a sudden Houston, we have a problem.Not only are the headphones themselves awful; the people at the company are awful too. I got into a fight with the guy who was in charge of orchestrating the first replacement because they forced me to pay my own shipping to get the headphones replaced.I simply cannot say enough terrible things about this product and this company. I will never buy Phillips again as long as I live, and I heartily encourage others to do the same."
1,Dont buy!,"Really awful headphones, this is my third time replacing them! The connection to the mini jack shorts after awhile and the swivel where the speakers attach to the head band breaks apart.. Happend three times to the same model.."
5,I love her as much as my kids!,We have all of Johnette's CD's and we are collecting her books. I love the music and the lyrics are fun. We have seen her perform many times and it's always a blast! This will be a great addition to your (child's) music library!
4,Sim ant is cool!,"Basically, you are a yellow ant in a coliny of black ants and you are trying to rid the yard of the red ants and run the humans out of their house.Or, you can play expiremental mode, where you can do almost ANYTHING you want!(bombard the yard with food, make ants, make walls, rocks etc.)Maxis should make a ""sim ant 2"", with more yards (and possibly have something special in the doghouse, such as, mabey, a dog?)"
3,I am a tester for maxis and EA,This game is fun for the whole family with easy learning for the kids and adults but this game could have been better at the start it is very hard to get use to but in the end it is very fun but after about a 2 month period it can get boring if you like simulated games go check out SIM CITY 3000 and THE SIMS they are great games!!! PoPkOrN
4,Pretty awesome. 'Nuff said.,"I've played everything from Earthbound to Zarklon, and everything in the early ""sim"" series will always rank towards the top of my list. This game (among many unknowns, but that's for another product review)provides a certainly welcome diversion from the grimy massacre seen on most systems these days. I've had enough Call of Duty. let's play some Sim Ant!As for the gameplay itself: It's tough to understand at first, but once you have it down, then it's quite easy to have fun with it, while also giving you quite a challenge. I don't think maxis really gets much credit, what with Nintendo and other more short-lived corporations such as Atari being the frontrunners. But personally, I think that what they created started something of a quiet revolution. If you enjoyed this, also pick up simcity-simcity 4, Rollercoaster tycoon (not a sim game, but amazing,) and Sim Farm."
4,pretty cool....,"except my nest ALWAYS got taken over by the stinkin' red ants!!ugh i went to experimental mode after that sprayed the queen ant and connected both nests to eachother cause it was so annoying to get killed all the time but i know there's humans i saw them once but where the heck is the dog? i don't get it the instructions said watch out for the dog,the reviews said there was a dog but i got in there and...where did he go?"
3,Satisfies one's love for digging,"This is the ultimate ant farm for those who can't afford one. You get an ant and you dig a nest. You bring green food to feed your queen. You avoid the spider. You repeat. You can while away hours and hours with this game, digging away happily, but then you will suddenly realize that you were digging for naught. Why?- When you switch between yard quadrants, all you work is replaced with a randomly-generated nest.- The ""warp spot"" is always in the same place.- The ants do just as well with your control as they do without such.- The ultimate secret - tell to no one: you can win the game by setting it to max speed and just waiting. The ants will oust the reds, the humans, the dog and the lawnmower completel without your supervision.This game gives you the illusion of being an ant. It also gives you the feeling of how worthless a single ant is. Try this game. It grows onto you."
1,No good,ok this game stinks the graphics are not great you usually get overtaken by the red ant colony and i only played this game once because i got bored.
1,Couldn't Do It,"I ordered The Assassins' Gate after seeing the author interviewed on The Daily Show. It sounded like a great book for learning the inner workings of the Iraq Debacle. Unfortunately, after the first few pages I was dazed and confused. Too much information. Too many names, dates, etc. Too many trains planes and automobiles. I almost always finish every book that I start. I feel ver yguilty if I don't finish a book I've started. So this one sat next to my bed, and I dreaded going to back to it, because I knew, deep inside that I wouldn't be able to get through it. I just knew it. That realization brought up feelings of guilt and embarrassment. Was I not smart enough to read a work of historical non-fiction? Am I just a novels guy? The book sat there and sat there until finally I came to a resolution in my head and said, ""OK, I am putting this aside. I'm not reading it."" I felt bad, becasue I really WANTED to get teh inside story on why we're in Iraq."
5,Be informed,"""You are not entitled to your opinion; you are entitled to your informed opinion. If you are not informed on the subject, then your opinion counts for nothing.""~ Harlan EllisonEverybody has an opinion on Iraq. We've all heard them. Well, after reading this book all I can say is - unless you have read this book your opinion counts for nothing."
5,The Definitive Book on Iraq,George Packer has written a masterpiece that speaks volumes! The book details the events that contributed to America's entering the War in Iraq and portrays the keyplayers involved. I even got a chance to hear him speak recently and he is extraordinarily down to earth. Enjoy!!
5,Should Be Required Reading for All Americans!,"I first saw George Packer on the Daily Show and was so impressed, I decided to read his book. What a great read it turned out to be. Having a first person pro-war (at first) account of the US invasion of Iraq told in such a level manner is refreshing. All the news ""pundits"" in the world can't compete with someone of Packer's experience and knowlege of the inside of this war.The scary part is that this all happened, in my lifetime and it couldn't be stopped. I can only hope this book is widely read and people start to talk about the issues that led us to this mess the Bush Admin now calls ""freedom""..."
3,Weak HDMI connector,I installed two of these and both of them had the hdmi connector screws crack loose. I still used it by flipping the hdmi connector so that the longer connection piece was on the outside of the plate. This allowed me to connect the hdmi cable without putting as much pressure on the screws that hold the connector to the plate. I highly recommend considering doing this prior to trying to plug in the cable because if the screw crack loose the hdmi connector does not sit tightly in the wall plate.
1,A Huge Disappointment,"I have always been an avid Sim player - SimCity (the original one), SimPlanet, SimTown, SimAnt... I've played them all (some only in teaching my nephew the fine art of being a SimAddict). This particular game was dull (there's so much stuff that could have been done with it - but wasn't). You only get a single perspective of the building and the main challenge (rather easily mastered) is to manage elevator service. I could think of a variety of perks that could have been put in to the building to make this game more interesting... but in the end you end up feeling like a slum-lord as you create this monster tower with no character to it. (Needless to say, there is no architectural element here... since the building is just the shell.)"
3,i agree with stamphers,this game is really fun in the beggining you get to build stuff and people move in.but towards the end it gets boring because like everyone moves out and your down money and cant build anything. so theres nothing to do but stop the game. but i did find a souloution for this that rarely works in the night every time build a bunch of condos for people to move into because some mornings people move out otherwise i would rate it a 5 but i couldnt really reccomend for you to buy it or not. if you like short games buy it.if you like to finish games to their full extent i strongly reccomend that you DO NOT BUY IT! but ill leave it up to you
1,Sim Tower ... !,If you don't have this game don't buy it. I bought it. It's impossible to not go bank rupt. Every time I tried to build a good tower I went bankrupt. It's the most stressful most frusterating game I've ever played. If you want to get a good game get Spider Man for Windows 95 + 98/2000.
3,A Semi-Good Sim Game,"Definately not the best simulation game put out, but still, this offers some addictive gameplay, until you reach ""tower"" status. There are different levels and your job is to build a sucessful mall complex, with shops, movie theatres, rec halls, condos, business offices and more. With rare VIP visits, bomb threats and Santa Claus this game doesn't have tooo many unexpected twists. You have to do a lot of waiting to get to new levels and to earn more money. I'd say if you like sim games give this one a shot if you find it at a cheap price."
4,Another one of those Sim Games,"This game is very fun for a long time. but eventually it gets boreing. Newer, faster, more popular games come out and then you set it aside. But while you're playing this game, you learn lots. You have to make it just right and position all of the offices, condos, fast food joints, hotel rooms, resteraunts, lobbies, parking spaces, and elevators in the right place to achieve a ""tower status."" This game is very addictive and I recommend it for people with lots of time(and who like games from the Sim collection)."
5,Great games,This is a very good game. You will naver get boring with this. I whish EA remake this game and make it compatible with XP.
4,Warning: Game might make you forget EVERYTHING ELSE,"This game is great for a break from writing a report or studying. My aunt owns her own caffe and loves this game. I guess to say if you have any intrest in buisness you will love this. Its easy to pick up and the only thing you have to worry about is ""what time is it ?!?"" or ""how long have I been playing this!?!"""
3,A tough go at it!,"This game presents a challenge. I struggled for hours trying to get my tower to the tower rating and wasn't able to defeat the challenge. If you can more power to you, but I was disappointed that my struggle didn't pay off!"
1,Don't bother,"My daughter quickly lost interest in this program. The fact that it still has some bugs did not help. It locked up on several occasions and during some of the games she selected the correct response but the game would not accept it. While this is cheaper than Hooked-On-Phonics, don't waste your money."
4,"A very good, basic ""statistics cook book""","If all you want is an easy, straight forward ""how do I?"" book, then this is about the best around. It's basic, but clear and SHORT (no wading through page after page to find the answer)."
2,Teaching for Dummies,"I am a high school English teacher, and I ordered the CD-ROM, expecting a polished unit, or at least some intelligent lessons to use with my Seniors. No such luck. I am terribly disappointed with the low-level ""study questions"" and the vocabulary lists. I was expecting something more stimulating. I can only use the quiz questions-- which, in reality, I could have written myself in about ten minutes per chapter. I am saved the trouble of typing them up, but I could have had a TA do that for free! I also found, mixed in with the guide, several pages which related to FRANKENSTEIN! I don't get it!!!It seems like this CD-ROM is one of a series of shoddily thrown together cookie cutter lessons which reflect very little intelligent, well-informed pedagogy."
4,Nice but over-priced.,"I liked the fact that the scent was long-lasting and that you don't need but a quarter-sized amount to get a good lather, I found it to be a bit ""pricey."""
4,Still one of the greatest underrated/undiscovered bands,"If you like the Thrill Kill Kult but want something a bit heavier, this is for you.same goes if you would like death metal without the cookie-cutter garbage throaty ""singing"".Seen them live in about '93 or so, bought the shirt off the singers back in Milwaukee, haha. Best $10 I'd ever spent."
4,Litewire made my season bright!,I recently purchased 14 feet of the white Litewire. It arrived just in time for Christmas and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. When I saw this wire I thought it would add a nice touch to my Christmas decorations so I decided to order it and give it a try. The Litewire is so much easier to work with and manage compared to my other strands of Christmas lights. I am already going to place an order for the red and green as well.
3,Only two (2) pieces.,"Bought this from Amazon, the package was delivered as scheduled but has only two (2) pieces for REAR windows.Contacted Amazon for replacement, but the new one came not different - has only 2 pieces.For the price of $55 for only 2 pieces, isn't it too expensive?"
2,A waste of money,What were these people thinking? It's yet another pitiful game title from Interplay. It has far too many bugs to be anywhere near enjoyable. All the facts about the ships and weapons is out of date and incorrect. The Interface is also far too complicated. I strongly recommend that you don't buy this game.
1,Does NOT work in Win XP,"As I'm unable to ""fully"" review this game, let me just say, the game is not compatible with WIN XP. If you are lucky (or foolish) enough to still be running Win 98, then you may be able to get the game to load."
2,Very Disappointed,"I'm not sure what the game designers were working towards when they designed this game but it reminded me of something you might come across on Sega Genesis (that is to say, low tech and predictable)."
2,"Good idea, Bad execution","The idea behind this game is spectacular. Get a fleet of ships or even a single ship, control it, kill stuff, whatever. A true Capitol Ship Combat game. This is not. Maybe its supposed to be. The controls are hard to figure, the instructions read like something from a TechEngineer, and it has more bugs than an ant hill. Example: going into combat, no damage, red alert, etc. MY WEAPONS WON'T FIRE! Or better yet, I take a hit reported to be only sheild damage, no hull damage, then I try to make a high-speed turn so I can fire back, AND ALL SYSTEMS FAIL! Not to mention, I still can't tell the other ships what to do except ""attack at will"" or ""run away"". Even after following the instructions, letter by letter! Good idea for a game, but almost a waste of money. But the graphics are spectacular! Try again Interplay! But next time, try a game that doesn't need 6 fix d/l's 3 weeks after release."
1,PLEASE MAKE IT STOP!,"This is the worst game ever! They make up weapons and races to try to make a stupid game interesting. It has no relation to The Star Trek Series. The missions are boring, take forever, and then you loose. If you are able to stay awake through a mission the rewards are rather lame. This game is sorry."
2,I'm one of those weirdos who likes this game...,"Starfleet Command (SFC) is an incredibly deep starship combat game-if you can call it a game. I think of it as more of a simulator, it's so complex. Star Trek nerds will love the many references to Star Trek's realistic technology and those technologies' application to galactic warfare. So I would recommend this game to Star Trek or science fans who like highly technical gameplay...like me! But most games these days are shallow, so new talent beware-this is a SIMULATOR, not a game. Space, the final frontier..."
2,Starfleet Command,"This was ok, but you keep repeating the missions over and over again. The game play could be better. The graphics were ok too."
4,Errrrrrr,"Well, bugs, bugs, an more bugs ! Fun game to play.....a little bit on the boring side at times. Game play is ok, interfact is good ( read the book!) But it a WAY TO EASY to ""win"" I give this a high rating because it is fun to play, an I am a big fan, but this is a game that people should take a little time with an make sure that they get the updates."
3,I wouldn&#65533;t recommend it until the bugs are fixed.,"The game of shear strategy is totally awesome. It is intense and may be as obsessive a game as Diablo 2. With the variety of characters available for play, boredom is not an option.Though the graphics are fantastic and real to life, don't get too obsessed in any one mission, or game play, as some unfixed bug in the program will undoubtedly crash and/or lock up your system.I have downloaded the update patch available from the online SFC2 site, but the program lock-up remains.That in my opinion is the major pitfall of playing this game at all...the game has potential, but I wouldn't recommend it until the bugs are fixed.After all, what fun is a game if you have to reboot your system just about the time things start to get interesting?"
3,An update...,"You may have read my other review giving this game a wonderful review. Well, to be honest, after about a week this game gets very old. The battles become predictable, as does the AI. Now that I have had this title for a while, I think it was a wast of my money. I do love Star Trek, but this game get old really fast, so beware of spending the money for this game, and don't just buy it for the cool graphics, either."
1,TOO SMALL!,"Do not WASTE your money. If ever a book needed to be large format, this is the one. I was extremely disappointed with the quality and size of the aerial photos. The dot-resolution is so low (about 85 lpi) that the detail is deminished in these already small images. Most photos are on average 1.5 to 3 inches on the page making if impossible to see the subject that is highlighted. Some photos are scanned from other books and have a pattern morray showing the dot on dot distortion. I would have done better to spent my money on the History Channel DVD."
2,Humbug,Am I nuts or is this toy almost IMPOSSIBLE for a small child to operate on their own? I can hardly use the crank to wind up the cars myself! The crank sort of slips around like it's stripped or something. Half the time I'm cranking the thing FOREVER and the car doesn't go anywhere! By the end of Christmas Day my hand was throbbing and my 4 year old was wondering why Santa brought him such a lame toy!!
5,A Parent's Dream!,"Finally...no batteries!! I have two boys, ages 5 & 3 and they both love this toy. We got it for Christmas 2003 and they still play with it almost every day. Nothing's broken on it. (I wish I could say the same for the other, more expensive toys they got!) I just got the loop accessory for my 3 year old's birthday and that's cool, too. My older boy's getting the vortex for his birthday next month. We get so frustrated when they want to play with a toy and it's either missing a piece or it needs new batteries. We've never had that problem with the racetrack. Everything's always there when you want to play with it, ready to go! We even like winding up the cars and running them across the floor, they really fly, even on carpeting! Excellent toy!!!"
5,Best track for young ones,I just got this for my son's third birthday. I'm thrilled with how easy it is for him to use. He loves race cars and we have been disappointed by the usual ones available in the store. The cars are bigger so they are easier for the little ones to handle. It is very durable and easy to set-up and store after use. I would highly recommend this.
5,Fun for all ages!,My 4 year old sons loves this toy! He was able to learn to use this toy all by himself. Very simple assembly for the parents. Even our dog has fun with this toy! You can go wrong with this one.
3,Great toy for the older children,This is a great toy when you talk about durability. However...Maybe because of the age of my children it doesn't keep their attention. They have difficulty winding it so I spend a majority of the time doing this. I am hoping when they get older( currently they are 2 and 3) they will find more of an interest in it. I would definitely recommend it for older children.
5,Best race track out there for a three year old!,We purchased this item for our three year old son and he loves it! It is so nice that you don't have to put batteries in it and it folds up flat and you can purchase additional cars for the track. My son can wind up the cars himself and set up the track by himself. We highly reccomend this to anyone with a three year old. It's very durable and portable (it even holds two cars when folded). We honestly don't think you won't be dissapointed.
3,"It's fun, but Big","It's really big. It does fold up, but it's still hard to store. Under the bed or closet are the only places for it. The car tops wouldn't stay on and eventually were lost.BUT... it's one year later and my son pulls this out once a week to drive his tractors and other cars on. It's sturdy. It was inexpensive, though shipping costs might outweigh value of toy.So the kids seem to like it enough, but it still seems pretty bulky to me."
5,fun for the whole family!,"I just bought this for my son's 3rd birthday. He loves it! It was nicer quality than I was expecting. Really durable design. My 11 y/o son thinks its fun too! He said he would like to have one :o) Fun for adults to play along with the children. Only took one time showing my little boy how to crank the handle to wind the car, counting to at least ten so it will run longer. No batteries to worry with.So many toys these days are junky cheap plastic that fall apart. This racetrack is definately nice in my opinion. I'm very pleased.The only thing I see to be a problem, the tops come off the cars. I guess if this happens when they crash this would make it more fun for older kids, but my 3 y/o gets aggravated cause he can't put them back together. We will have to work on this. If all else fails, I could tape or glue for the time being. Its just they way they are made."
5,"1 of my all time favorite books, inspriational,entertaining","Great story about the world of tennis, but more about people working towards a dream and what they are willing to do to acheive it. A wonderful story about honor, courage, humor, love and freindship. Highly recommended. I read it every time I feel down."
5,Three Investigators Books are Fantastic!!,"I used to read my older brother's Three Investigator books when he borrowed them from the school library. I so wanted to live in a trailer with a secret escape hatch like Jupiter had.I have bought as many books as I could find for my son who is eleven and loves reading about Jupiter, Bob and Pete's adventures. We look in every secondhand shop we can find and are slowly getting the entire series."
2,"Should not be called ""universal"".","Doesn't fit on Pearl Hi Hat stands, or at least the one I have. That being said, the build quality seemed fine."
5,A very well built shirt,"I received this as a gift, and intended only to wear it as a rugby ""fashion"" jersey, as I already have several real jerseys. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that this shirt is actually pretty heavy duty, and could actually be used in a game or a scrimmage if necessary. The Guinness logo is embroidered on the front of the shirt, and I believe you can customize the order to have a name on the back, if you wish. Recommended for fans of Guinness and/or rugby."
2,interpreting and using regression,"I need to find how to do regression analysis on SPSS with many different kind variables (how to prepare for analysis e.g. preparing dummy variables, selecting variables, selecting type of process <enter, forward, backward> and interprete them.I am not a statistican, I don't need statistical explanation. I only need practical way to use this method appropriately, but I can not find my needs.It would be helpful for reeders if there is short summary of books,"
4,Good Read,"Yes that's right I decribed a text book as a good read! It is also an easy read, no falling asleep here. It is informative and thought provoking. Dont skim through enjoy it."
4,Intercultural Communication in the Global Workplace,"This book is very informative worldwide view of how we have to be more aware of each others traditions, beliefs and cultural differences etc. We must learn to get along, work together, respect each other and take responsibility for our ever changing environment. By understanding our differences and finding solutions to our problems as a whole. We can make this shift together where we all can benefit and not just some."
1,Horrible Software,"Says that it works with Windows XP. Well, that's a load. I actually left the computer on overnight so this stupid cd could load, but it was ""thinking"" all night. As soon as I loaded the cd and clicked on ""start"" in order to load it, it just froze. I tried at least 5 times before I just gave up and sent it back. What really sucks is that we are leaving for Paris in 4 weeks and I can't even think of what to get that would give me the basics fast enough. So, save your money if you have Windows XP."
1,Cheap product,"I had these canisters for a few months in my kitchen, then they started wearing - pitting, staining, - the finish simply wore off. They do not seal tightly, but keep mice and bugs out. Don't waste your money. The photo may look good, but the product is garbage, which is where mine ended up this week!"
1,Awful!,"These canisters are such a disappointment. They looked beautiful when I first bought them, but the finish has worn off just from sitting on my counter, and now they look terrible. I finally bought canisters after many years of not having them, and I thought these would last. But they look dreadful."
1,Looked great at first,"They looked great at first. But over time the lacquer finish started to look bad from grease splatters etc. This I could overlook, however over time they started to rust. Sure enough I placed a magnet on them and it stuck. They were only copper plated!! I had the impression when I bought them that they were solid copper. I threw them out in disgust."
1,OLD DUTCH COPPER CANISTERS,"These look beautiful when you first get them, but after awhile the finish wears off and they are ugly. Would have been better if they hadn't put the lacquer on and you could polish them. Too expensive to last only a few months."
3,Not that bad....but not that good either!,"They look really good in my kitchen! However, the lids are not vacuum sealed as it states in the description, I had to use Ziploc bags to make sure that the coffee and tea stays fresh inside. I'll probably just keep them for a while until they start to look ugly, then replace them with better quality ones. If you're considering copper canisters in your kitchen, I suggest just going for the more expensive, better quality ""solid copper"" ones out there that you can keep for years..."
2,didn't wear very well,"They looked great for the first few months. But any hint of moisture on the bottoms made them lose their finish. The typical grease splatters and other messy situations you'll find in a kitchen make them look bad pretty quickly. Plus, as other reviewers have mentioned, the plastic liner/seal is worthless. Don't plan to use these as functional canisters -- they're decoration only. After a year, I threw them away. What a shame, especially because they seemed so good at the beginning."
2,Not to be confused with quality copper,"These canisters are sort of decent, I suppose, just not anywhere near the quality I was looking for. If you've invested in quality copper cookware like Mauviel or Falk, don't even think of buying these to match. The laquer coating on mine started to show signs of wear by the second month, and the bottoms had started to rust from the occasional wet countertop. The biggest one doesn't even hold a 5lb bag of flour, so nearly worthless, in my opinion. I wish I'd saved my money. Even at $29, they are about $20 overpriced."
2,Polemical racism is still racism,"This is a right wing attack by a right wing author. This is an author who minimizes Japanese' hideous crimes in the interest, as in the mode of Ishihara and other latter day absurd rightist politicians, of Japanese exertion of its right to assume a paternalist role in Asia while committing outrageous violence. In the process, he repeatedly instrumentalizes Japanese murder and assaultive crimes against Korea and China. It's excusable in the author's eyes, to support your country in its moment of extreme crisis. Minimize and disregard that the ""extreme crisis"" was one of all-out assault and mass murder. Grotesque."
1,LEGO Creator not created well,"Very disappointing piece of software. The working area is about 1/2 the screen size. It is difficult to navigate and use. The ""OFFICIAL"" activity book is also useless. It gives you projects to do that don't work the way they are supposed to. Definitely not worth the money."
1,Frustrating,"I agree with the reviews I have read. Unfortunatelly, when I read the reviews I had already bought the product. I think it is boring,very complicated and frustrating."
3,"Complex, Slow, and Realistic","This is good for people who like to build Legos, but don't have the pieces, but has some significant downsides. The creation inevitably takes long and is fairly complex. It's difficult to get a good view of your creations with the tools provided. It's slow and choppy for outdated computers (mine's 200 megahertz). On the plus side, this is realistic (compared to actually making a lego creation) and has some neat fun things (like dynamite). Ultimately, I only recommend this for people who like to build and have a computer with at least 500 megahertz."
1,A game not worth it,"Lego fans are always interested in a new way to use legos, in this case, the computer, with Lego Creator. The cover it seems all cool with the nifty features and good graphics. Along with ""ease-of-use."" Well that all changes when you actually play the game. With it's half screen viewing, and not ""easy to use"", you think again weather you just lost 19.95. And guess what, you did! The game is stupid and boring, along with very hard to use. I thought it would be easy. Click to add a piece. Well no, it's hard. It's basiclly a challenge to get the piece in place. You could make a game, ""Get a Piece Connected: Brought to you by Lego Creator, the Ripoff Software!"" The graphics are hidious, and sound is not what is should be. And everything else, well, it's bad. That's all I can say. It's bad.A reviewer from NY"
1,"""Complex"", ""NOT User-Friendly"", and ""A Real Drag""","This software takes forever to load and once loaded it is painful to use. My son and I, both thought the program is overly complex and not intuitive. Time passed quickly while trying to build simple structures, which made the user loose interest and become bored. It also appeared to limit the users imagination & creativity that you typically have when using the real blocks. It definitely did not meet our expectations."
1,not worth it,"i got this game a while ago and i rarley play it anymore. this game doesent deserve half a star. there are no boats or planes, only helicopters. the only good part was playing. it's slow and the graphics and sound are bad for a PC game. Ther are very few good parts to this game, it is only worth about 7 dollars."
4,i like elliott,"the debut lp for the band from louisville is a great one. filled with emotional, personal lyrics, and hard sounding guitaring, its an essential album for indie lovers. the difference between elliott and other hardcore/emo/punk (whatever) band is that instead of ur nasal, obnoxious, raspy voice, frontman chris higdon uses beautiful sounding soft airy vocals (although sometimes incomprehensible.) the second lp of elliott's is far better than this, but think of U S songs as a blueprint for the fantastic band elliott would become."
2,Wasted Money on a toy that only works for 8 months,"We bought this toy for our 3 month old to give her last Christmas. Now that she is 1 she is still playing with it, too bad the electronics went out on it! Nevermind the fact that you have to change the batteries in it every 3 weeks! My daughter didn't use it that much as an infant because she couldn't reach the toys or do anything with the mobile except watch it spin slowly in a circle. It was great as a sitting up toy the few times it actually worked. We wasted $30.00 on this, I now wish we had just gone with the much cheaper and more colorful Fisher price version."
4,Fantastic toy!,"Friends of ours gave this to our daughter right after her birth last year. When she was quite young, she liked to lay beneath it and watch the mobile turn; then, when she was a little older, she liked to play with the interactive parts. The music and lessons are wonderfully done, and while the music WILL get lodged in parents' heads, you won't mind. ;)The only reason I am giving this a '4' instead of a '5' is that I agree with other reviewers, that baby needs to be a little older to really be able to use it. I, too, had to support our baby in order that she could play with it. This wasn't a huge inconvenience, but it is something to think about."
5,leapfrog learning gym,"My son received this from my mom for christmas ( he was born Oct. 11th so he was very young when he received it but now he loves it! he climbs all over it and uses it as a balance to stand himself up. he spins the little globe around and leans back and pulls on it, thus moving it across the floor it is so durable and easy to move from the laying dawn to the sitting up position and the volume can be adjusted to a fairly high but safe volume, the songs also are not to bad as far as annoying goes they are tolerable!! we love this toy and would reccomend it to anyone!"
1,Not Age Appropriate,"I was so excited when I purchased this toy at Toys R Us. I thought it would be perfect for my seven week old son who is beginning to bat and kick at toys, plus he LOVES the dreamscape soother, also by leap frog. I was misled by the suggested age on the packaging (birth +). The gym sits very high from the ground making it impossible for him to even think of reaching it. My husband and I really liked the spinning globe part, but our baby could have cared less. The light up part is VERY weak and not at all interesting. The mobile part comes off too easily for a baby that could reach it and it looks like the kind of toy you get in a Happy Meal. We took it back the very next day."
2,there must be better gyms out there,"this was one of four gyms that I received as gifts, and I decided to keep this one and return the rest since I trusted LeapFrog as a company. Big mistake! Even though this was the priciest of them all, I'm convinced that it wasn't the best. It only plays one song, which is short, and then turns off by itself, so I have to keep running to turn it back on. I think it'd be much better if the light display was better or if it had more toys to bat at than just the mobile. My son is only three months old, so I'm hoping he'll like it more once he can play with it sitting or standing up."
4,"Very cute, but",it didn't hold his attention for long.. it really is cute and very educational.. it is worth it.. I think my little man is just too active.. lol.. but he did like it!
3,Not for Lying Down,"This is not a great activity for a child laying on his back. There is nothing to physically interact with. However, my son at 5 months old, is able to sit up and finds it somewhat amusing. I am hoping that in the coming weeks he will be more interested. When he was younger, I would somethimes push it up to him while he was laying in his car seat."
3,She may grow into this...(not for newborns),"While I do like this toy, I am not too sure if it is for a newborn, even at 4 months old, there really isnt too much interaction available, and there is no possible way, even if sitting in her bouncy seat that she can reach the mobile.I do like the music and the idea of the different languages (although, the sound quality is not too clear) - I will try again in a few months. I am not giving up just yet"
1,Disappointed!!,"We were very disappointed with the gym after we put it together for our 5 month old. There is not enough lights or action going on for him. My son just holds the mobile with his feet or hands. We bought this item over the fisher price piano, we are going to return the gym and get something else."
1,A dud!!!!,"This is okay for a baby who can sit up...maybe a 7-month-old. But, you'll have to take the top piece off of the base and lay it on the floor. As a matter of fact, don't bother putting it together. A young infant's interest is not held by the very, very small light green lights. I've had other toys meant for babies to lie on their backs and enjoy...this is NOT one of them. They can't reach the hanging objects and it really is too boring for them. Again, an older baby of 7 months or so can enjoy the unit as a floor toy."
3,not one of leapfrog's best products,"Though my son watches the mobile and likes the music, it is not as exiting as I thought it should be. It does not grab his attention for as long as other toys we have for him, but it keeps him satisfied for 10 or 15 minutes at a time. I hope once he can stand up and play with it that it will be more interesting for him."
2,My daughter don't care for it!,"I'm the one playing because my daughter ignore it. She only like the music thing but the other features, nah!"
2,More infor needed!!!!,"I would like to see some more information needed on how this toy works, how it is used ie: can they use it while on there tummies?, can it be used while they grow up? This info would be great before i buy it and waste my money!!! Thanx"
2,not that interesting,My son gets bored very easy. This toy just doesn't do that much. I will sit him up to play with it(he can't fully sit on his own yet). I'm still hoping maybe when he gets older he'll like it more. If I knew this before though I would never had wasted the money.
1,Leapstart is a disappointment,"We bought this for my daughter for Christmas when she was 2 months old. She hated it then, and now 8 1/2 months later she still hates it. It doesn't do much and all my daugher uses it for now is to pull up on. The toy is boring and just not active enough. A total waste of money and will be put in out garage sale very soon."
2,not a good buy,"The toy needs its music to last longer w/ particularly with YOUNGER infants. Itty bitty babies don't do a whole lot physically, so the machine should do more FOR them. It's also confusing for an adult.. much less a child to figure out. Not the best use of our dollars in my opinion."
2,A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT,"WE BOUGHT THIS BECAUSE OF LEAP FROGS' REPUTATION AND FOUND THAT OUR SON WAS JUST NOT INTERESTED. AT FIRST GLANCE IT APPEARS TO BE ENTERTAINING, BUT ITS ACTUALLY ANNOYING. IF WE WOULD HAVE KEPT THE RECEIPT, I WOULD'VE RETURNED IT"
2,NOT AGE-APPROPRIATE: Great idea but VERY DISAPPOINTING,"Great idea on educational front but it looks like Leapstart failed to do some testing of the product on real babies. My daughter is almost 6moths old and she can't reach any of the controls except for the moving mobile! And this is branded as a ""Birth +"" toy?! We might have to put this away until she's either bigger or until she can sit upright on her own and use it in sitting position. Hopefully the sit-up position is better designed so she can reach the controls on her own. We'll see. PS: I just read reviews of my First Touch Leap Pad for 6months+ and it looks like the product is not age appropriate either. Very disappointing, Leapstart!"
3,Like but not age appropriate,I like this toy but it not age appropriate. My daughter is 5 months and she loves listening to the music but of course cannot reach the globe or anything else except for the mobile. I was not that impressed with the mobile either. It's definately good for a 7-8 month baby.
2,Not a gym,"This toy is not interactive in the infant mode. My 5 month old can kick the mobile, but that doesn't really do anything. She likes the music, but I could buy a single cd that does better."
3,Disappointed,"Someone gave us this toy and my daughter enjoyed it in infant mode- she liked lying on her back watching globe and listening to the song. I put it away for a while but now she sits up and LOVES her leapfrog learn and groove table, so I thought I'd pull this back out for her. She can sit up and push a few buttons, but for some reason she HATES this toy! Every time I try to show her how to play with it, she looks at it for a minute and then starts crying, especially if she spins the globe. I'm disappointed because I like the different languages and songs. I wish she enjoyed it more- maybe if she plays with it more, she'd like it, but I can't bring myself to watch her cry with this toy when she has others that she clearly enjoys playing with more."
4,Fabulous Learning Toy!,"I give the Learning Gym 4 1/2 stars! I may be a bit prejudiced (I love LeapFrog products) but my son adores this gym. In the beginning he was content to listen to the songs and watch the mobile. He cracks up laughing whenever we sing the &quot;Hello!&quot; song to him. As a bonus, his big sister also enjoys sitting with him, playing and singing along. It's given them another way to bond. As he's grown, the mobile encouraged him to reach and excerise those tummy muscles. Now that he's sitting up it's as if he has a new toy since you change the learning mode. The only reason I didn't give the product 5 stars is because if you have a very active baby this product may not hold their attention for as long as you'd like. However, we made sure to purchase an activity gym for that purpose."
2,It's a nice thought,"I have to agree with the other reviewers - - in the lie-down infant mode, this one is a little disappointing. The mobile moves really slowly, and there's not a great deal my 4 1/2 month old can do with it when he's lying down. He can't reach the other knobs and things on the gym, and the mobile doesn't really do much else. The music and words are nice, but they only hold his attention briefly. I was hoping this would be something that he could have been more interactive with, but it's not. For this kind of money, I wish I'd researched a little more and found something more appropriate for him."
1,not entertaining for an infant!!,"We recieved this as a Christmas gift for our 4 month old daughter. I would rather have gotten the Little Tykes 5-in-1 Adjustable Gym. But, I have been pleased with all of our other LeapFrog toys. With much hesitation we opened it and put this gym together.The only part she really likes is the mobile, which really isnt all that exciting. The lie down setting plays an obnoxious song that I found singing to myself all throughout the day. Another problem is that the mirror can only be seen if you can pull it open and then it closes again. Babies seem to prefer a mirror that the can look at constantly. The box boasted about teaching other languages. That is true if you count 'hello' and the number 1-5 as other languages.All in all, this product isn't geared toward infants. There aren't colorful flashing lights and various up beat songs. If I could I would take it back and get the Little Tykes one."
4,A very satisfied aunt,"I bought this item for my nephew and absolutely love it. The lights and sounds really intrigue him. He especially loves the moving mobile and of course, I love that the mobile will stop if touched. Little hands could get hurt if it continued to move. Once my nephew is old enough to sit on his own, I know he will love playing with this toy in the ""sit-up"" mode. For the time being he is happy and content listening to the wonderful songs played to him by the gym. As I expected Leapfrog made another wonderful product."
3,Seen better things from Leap Frog,"i got this for my then 3 month old daughter. She enjoyed staring at the mobile and listening to the music. My son who was 15 months played with the ""book"" part of it and the globe. Now shes 7 months but doesn't sit so she still has to lie on her back to play with it which makes it a boring toy for her. My son likes trying to climb on it. And for the $$$ you'd think it would do alot more."
4,"If your baby doesn't sit yet, use a bounce chair with!","The music is great, and the globe is cool, but the mobile? Take it right off, and put your baby in a bounce chair underneath and watch 'em go!!! This worked best for us...now our son can reach the globe, play peekaboo, punch all the buttons, etc...We have been using it this way since he was 4 months, he is now 6 months and sitting on his own under it, and still loves it!!!"
1,Boring....,"We bought this when my son was 1 month old - he never really seemed too interested in it. He couldn't touch any of it and we had to move things to get it to change music (which is very limited) or actually get it to do anything. Now he is 6 months and even with the new adjustment to the sitting position it is awkward for him to push the buttons and the globe. It is like he is sitting in the front row of a movie theater with his head leaning back, but he has to be that close in order to reach the different buttons - which he has no interest in. Don't buy it - it really is not fun and although I did learn how to say hello in other languages, I don't think he really cares about that."
3,great for when he's a little older,"my baby is two months old and he finds the mobile very entertaining. anyone who is upset over their baby not being able to reach the toy is pretty silly to me. of course they cannot reach it, and even if they could reach it at this age they wouldn't play with it anyway. it is a very educational toy and i look forward to the things he will learn as he gets older. a down side is the lights dont seem to be very entertaining i'd recommend this to anyone with a baby who can already sit not a baby that cant. i'd reccomend the fisher price aquarium take along swing."
2,Fun for a while,We bought this toy when our son was 2 months old and he loved it for a while now that he is four months old he does not want to play with it at all. Hopefully he will play with it when he is a little older.
2,Not worth it!,"We received this toy as a gift for our son. Considering the money that you pay for this, it is not worth it. The mobile is boring and there are only 4 lights for the babies to look at. The day we put the frame together it came apart and has not stayed together since then. If I could take this toy back, I would."
2,Disappointed!!,"I bought this toy for my 2 month old for Easter. It seemed like a great product with many features. I was really disappointed when I put it together. The mobile provides very little entertainment since it is just plastic pieces that spin in a circle. There is nothing for them to really bat around and get any amusement from. It plays the same song over and over. I was hoping for more of an international mix of music. Also the color wheel has very light colors, which I think would make it a little harder to teach your child colors. The orange and yellow are almost identical. I thought that LeapFrog was supposed to have such great products, but this product does not make me want to purchase other LeapFrog items. It is not worth the $40. Hopefully I can return this product and get something that offers more entertainment."
4,Age recomendation needs to be upped.,"Like all LeapFrog products, this is very nice, and the voice is so soothing.The main thing is that an infant would not be able to see the beautiful spinning globe, and that the baby would have to be able to sit up by themselves in order to reach it.A little design tweaking by Leap Frog would make this the PERFECT toy!"
3,Disappointed...,"I received this as a gift for my 4 month old son, and I have to say I'm somewhat disappointed. It's not interactive at all, as the globe and the buttons are not within reach, and the mobile doesn't interest him in the slightest. He kicks at it, but it doesn't look as though it's intentional. The music is okay, but it doesn't entertain him very long. Spend your money on something else. Hope this helps!"
2,Disappointed,"I saw the ads for the Fisher Price Activity Gym and when I went to purchase it, I came accross the LeapFrog version....being impressed with the sophistication and learning potential of other Leapfrog products, I opted for this toy...made the wrong decision! Although the gym entertains my 3 month old son, I can see his boredom growing....he likes to reach and interact with toys. At this stage, all he can do is kick the mobile and that does not cause any effect. I do like the music and the influence of other languages and the globe, but for this age, think a more interactive version would have been better."
2,disappointed,I am starting to wonder what all the Leap Frog hype is about.The music is nice on this gym and it is colorful but the only thing my baby can reach in the infant mode is the mobile and that doesnt keep him occupied for long. He cant press the sun and moon or flip the mirror down or touch the globe or spin anything. The way the box discribed it you would think that it did more than it does. For the most par the toy is durable but the stand is a little flimsy. So overall it is pretty educational mostly durable and not much fun.My son likes his gymini better and now Fisher Price has a play mat called Link a doos and it looks much more fun.
5,Nice Book,Bought this book for a class and it allows me to get an “A” and I only attended half the classes. And the class I did attend I mostly surfed the internet.
4,Great looking watch,"Great, sporty looking Baby G. This is my third Baby G. My others are the jelly band or dolphin research model. Though the picture for this one isn't great, it doesn't disappoint in person. If you're looking for an all- around watch that looks similar to the men's basic model G-Shock, this is a good choice."
2,Casio watch review,"While I found the instructions for the Casio watch not user friendly, once my husband was was better able to access the instructions than I, I did keep the watch and now enjoy using it when I swim."
4,SIM SAFARI ROCKS!!!,"I'm a computer hog. My mom thinks I spend to much time on the computer. When I got Sim Safari it came in a game pack. Suprisingly, I really enjoyed it. You can:1. check animal pop.2. build a camp for incoming visitors3. capture animals if pop. is to highI gave this 4 stars because the camps barely have any people and the money goes away too fast! For ex. the amphitheater was $15,000! I still like playing the missions, like the one where you try to keep the cheetah pop. up! IF YOU LOVE ANIMALS AND THE SIMS OR OTHER SIM/TYCOON GAMES YOU WILL LOVE THIS! If not wait till it goes on sale!"
3,"OK for an old game,but not for fans of new games","This is an ok game for the time period it was released in. The graphics aren't great by today's standards though. The game play is easy and not very interactive,but it can be relaxing to just sit and watch the animals. Basically, all you do is place the animals down on the land and then you can click on them and see videos of them doing 2 or 3 different actions. It's kind of fun to click on the animals and watch them for a little while,but gets old after a bit.It of course has famous african wildlife like lions, zebras, and girraffes, as well as not so famous wildlife like African Wild Dogs which I was suprised but happy to see. Overall, I think it was a decent game for the time period it was released in,but not that great of a game by today's standards. I gave it three stars because I took into account the period it was released in. If this game had been released in more modern times though, I would have given it one, maybe two stars."
2,Average Game,"I like games that people do not get bored of even if you have played them many times and this game did not give me this feeling! After one hour of playing I got so bored I accually just shut down the computer and watched TV.I will say that the graphics are nice and the game, for the fist hour is pretty fun! Anyway, I would say that you should not buy this game!"
2,Sims are over rated always,"SimSafari involves building an managing your own Safari park,add animals,huts and more.It's ok but soon bores."
3,Be aware with NEW iPod Nano's,"I have been using this product with the older style iPod Nano and it works great.However, be aware that the new ""colored"" iPod Nano's WILL NOT FIT in this product. Turns out that Apple has shifted the connector such that it will not fit in the base of this product due to the plastic housing around the unit.I called Belkin and they are aware of this and told me to use the FULL iPod version of the Tunebase with the adapter for the Nano instead of using the version for the Nano."
2,Love the look but can't get it to work,I tried by darndest best to get it to work but the static was way too much! I ended up returning it.
5,awesome product,"We live in the Denver area, and have not had a problem with static. This product tuned in with ease once mounted in the vehicle. Located a weak FM station, and then tuned the ipod into the same station and you are done. We drove around our city and tested it, and it sounded like a cd player but with the flexible video ipod we could listen to a variety of music or video. I was surprised how well it functioned and sounded. Our vehicle is 10 years old and has the original radio/cassette player in it."
1,Non Compatable,I have several friends that have had similar items in the last few years that have worked nicely. I'm sure this is a great product. Having said that... this product is NOT and I repeat IS NOT compatable with the new ipod nanos. The new Ipod Nanos are slightly wider than the original and will not connect to this product. I really hope amazon puts up a warning soon and I will do my best to try to get that done. Again this does not work with the 4GB and I assume the 8GB nano as well so do not buy it unless you have the older model Nano.
1,Not compatible with 2nd generation Nano's,"Be aware, the Belkin F8Z063-BLK TuneBase FM for iPod Nano is not compatible with the 2nd generation Nano. I am returning mine to Amazon, and buy a compatible one from the Apple store."
1,Not such a good product,I bought this device as a solution for my Nano in my car. It does not work well at all. I live in the Washington DC area and all the vacent channels I tried had loud static whenever I used the device. I made a trip up the east cost and had static all the way. The device is not worth the money I paid. I will try to find a different solution such as cable to the aux jack of my radio.
2,TuneBase FM hits sour note,"The good news: product us attractive, fits nicely into the aux power outlet, holds the iPod Nano out of the way but accessible. But I expect it to do that and still provice a pleasant listening experience. Didn't happen. There was no way to reduce the static (perhaps only in our part of the country?) to an acceptable level. We checked with Apple, and as they instructed we made sure the sound was at less than 50% on the Nano. Same problem. At times, it would seem to get better but couldn't hold down the static for long. Tried numerous resets and new stations with the same result. It's a great idea that, for us, didn't pan out. We stopped using it when my wife informed me that ""I've had enough of that NOISE."""
1,Connector not matching,"I can't review a product I can't use however... its connector just doesn't match the new Nanos (mine is the 8gb), hence its marketing is misleading. And I am stuck with it."
3,Seems great...but not for LA/Pasadena,"I loved the idea of this...but in Pasadena? NO LUCK. I could get no station that would pick up. The guy at Apple told me when I took it back that these FM transmitters don't tend to work well in LA. Well? We are a HUGE market, could someone please invent a new product that works from our CD players or something? (I have a recent model SAAB--no cassette, not iPod ready.)...ah headphones while driving...!"
2,This is for the old Nano!,"Read carefully. This adapter is for the first generation Nano, not the new ones."
2,will not fit,"This unit works great with the older 1 gig nano, however, the newer 2 gig nano will not plug in. The opening on the nano is slightly closer to the middle and therefore will not make connection. I have contacted Belkin several times and they will not respond."
2,Poor transmission,"The product was easy to setup and use but the sound quality was horrible. Even with a nice clear frequency you can still hear a significant amount of static, the sound quality is way worse than what you would get from any radio station. I sometimes even had a hard time getting my car sterio to register the frequency that I would pick because there was so much static it wanted to just skip to the next station. What's more interesting is if I wrapped a piece of aluminum foil around the top of my ipod and sort of formed a small antennae with it I would actually get very decent sound quality, just slightly worse than what you get from most radio stations. However, for an $80 piece of hardware, you should not have to resort to ridiculously looking antennae ad-ons made out of aluminum foil to get it to work right."
4,pleased with the Belkin Tunebase,I want to say that all I heard was the Monster Cable FM transmitter was far better than any other models. I want to clarify this statement with this review. I purchased the Monster Cable version last fall(2006) and found it akward to place in the vehicle and found I was always laying my IPOD on the passenger seat. Do this I found my reception was very poor! Maybe because I have an internal antenna in the back window I am not sure. But just to the contrary my BELKIN works very good. I rated it 4 out of 5 as i still think there is room for improvement but to this date it is the best I have seen!!!
1,2G Silver Nano Users Beware,"Just to reinforce, this product DOES NOT work for iPOD Nano 2G. I bought one for my wife and did not realize the interface is offset on the Nano, but is center set on the Belkin. If you like the design, you need to by the one for the 30G, which then has an insert to cradle the 2G Nano. DO NOT BUY this product if you have a 2G Nano."
1,What he said...!!!,"""Please be aware that although the product description specifically says that this unit is compatible with the Nano 2GB it is not. The connectors do not match.""I copied and pasted another reviewer's copy for my review, specifically because I experienced the exact SAME problem. The new 2GB Nanos will NOT fit in the holder despite the company's online claims...which remain unchanged as of this writing.I have no idea of the thing works well or not...might be the best transmitter ever invented...but it doesn't matter if I can't get the device into the transmitter's base!I am waiting for a response from the vendor that sold it to me through Amazon to see if they will refund my money. No response yet. I will give it one more day before becoming concerned.If they do not respond or refund, I will attempt to use Amazon's ""A-Z"" gaurantee to seek out a refund. Fingers crossed."
4,"Does what it says, don't expect concert sound","This product is working out fine for me. The only problems are not the fault of the TuneBase. It works best when you can find an unused part of the FM band. In the Baltimore-Washington corridor, there is literally an FM station every other frequency stop on my cars FM dial. Some are weak and remote but even that can affect your reception. Cars with FM antennas nearer the cigarette lighter will probably help the TuneBase break through easier.There is a signal boost feature that I have not yet tried.If you carry your Nano around in any sort of silicone or other hugging type case, you will have to slide it up to fit the nano into the tunebase. This can block the controls, but again that is not the fault of the TuneBase.This is the only device of this kind I have tried, but I have not found a need to try any other."
2,Not a good transmitter for big city,I live in the Atlanta area and was never able to get a good sound quality coming from the Belkin FM transmitter. It seemed like I was listening to a FM station that was not coming in good.
1,This things sucks,"Every time you hit a bump it drops connection with the base. This is not a universal fm transmitter problem, it's a huge flaw in the design of this piece. DON'T BUY IT."
2,wait for a while,"Con:1). No auto-scan function to search an unused FM band, so that would easy to cause car accidents while drivers were trying to find an unused FM channel by manually operated----2). Sound's quality worse then car CD player.suggestion:The idea of this product which is good , but if you are thinking to buy this product, wait for a while!"
1,media's new angle,"My high school has been using these books for a while now and my brother, cousins, friends, some teachers and I all agree that these books a farelly low quality. Our teachers are constintally telling us were the books are misstaken.One of the things that I consider to be a great dissapointment in these books is that they tend to be more of an advertising tool than a text book, quite frequently my friends and I feal that the authors of this book were more conserned by their fiancial status that our learning ability.After consulting my peers we have come to a conclusion that it is a pitty that 1 is the lowest star amount for we ALL agree that this book deserves a ZERO!!!and FYI our school's spelling is pretty bad too so forgive me."
5,"Well, I'd like to say her Brahms is 'Way Cool'!","Is it Okay if I say Viktoria Mullova's Brahms is Cool? And I also think Mullova and Anderszewsky are 'Cool' musicians. Mullova's violin has got something transparent and the melody line is transcendental. Anderszewsky,although less known than Mullova, makes a good music partner as a pianist. His playing is so rich and deep in emotion and detail that it almost mesmerizes me. The Two Cool Musicians are a perfect match. There are other recordings by Mutter , Chung, Zukerman, etc. But I strongly recommend this disc. Mullova is 'TRULY HERSELF' in every piece of music she plays. And she explores areas of emotions and rhythm that were never found by any other artist. She has a great intuition as a musician and this recording shows it all."
3,Support Italorap.,"Neffa is a credit to italorap, his last album was amazing, however this album is only very good. The beats are getting a little more jiggy and though the guests are on the whole good, especially MC mello. There are a couple of guys who ruin the album a little bit for me. Dre lover is awful, his rhymes sound like something an 11 year old would come up with, and Sean should really think about rapping in his own language, cos it certainly aint english! Apart from these two guys the album is really good, honest!! If you like italo rap, or just want to see what it's like I can recommend this album, also check out Neffa's track on the brilliant Novecinquante album buy fritz da cat, it's super dope."
3,Inconsistent Units are a Pain,One very aggravating part of this book was the mixture of English and Metric units in the problems and tables. This is supposed to be a text on learning thermodynamics. Not one of learning unit conversions. Trying to understand and apply some of the examples was very tedious because the examples used English units while the tables were all done in Metric.
5,A perennial favorite,"This issue marked the last that Elizabeth Pepper, founder and editor, was at the helm. She died in July, while the issue was nearing print. It's a tribute to her and her friends and staff that this issue shows no sign of the turmoil and grief that the staff must have felt at her passing. It's still the charming compilation it ever was, with astrological nuggets by Dikki-Jo Mullen and numerous fascinating articles by other authors. A treasure."
5,Witches' Almanac 2006-07,"When I see it, it's bought. The format is basically the same every year, but it has a way when you read/look at it, you find what you're looking for. The cover has a way of drawing a person to it. Plus I always learn something new. Everyone of interest, should just have this book."
2,Not an easy read,"This is the main textbook for my analysis course in a Religious Studies major. As an introduction to anthropology it seems to assume quite a bit of prior knowledge. It is also unnecessarily heavy on the anthropology and light on the religion. Certain chapters offer almost no mention of religion.That said, some chapters were captivating such as the one on Ritual.To sum up, if this book were not required reading for a course I would have skipped it."
1,worst star trek game ever!,"this game totally ruins the star trek name..please, i beg you, for your own sanity, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!"
3,very well made.,"Overall, I liked this game. good smooth graphics speaking since it doesn't require high-end expensive graphics card. Only thing i hated was I can click tricorder map and go directly to the spot, i have to scroll slowly to the spot. There is no cheats to this game either unlike most games out there. You cant save games during missions, only between them. I don't mind this but you might. I have AMD K6-2 500mhz computer and It hasn't crashed on me yet. It seems pretty stable to me."
2,Disappointing,At first it looked very cool but as I started to play it I realized there is no way to save except after completing a level. Considering how much time it takes to complete a level and how much time I have I can't play. It really stinks!!!!!
2,No roda no Windows seven,"O jogo instala mas no inicia , aparece uma mnsagem de erro.Acho que ele no roda no windows seven."
2,A flawed game.,"Sure, when you read the features on this game, any sane Trekkie will have their mouth watering, but when I bought the game I noticed it had a lot of problems. The missions are way too complicated and take hours to finish, and if you screw up when you've almost finished it's very frustrating. There's no way to save or minimize so it takes forever to do anything. While it's cool to see your colony grow and to see how the different races handle different scenarios it's not a great game."
1,This Game Sucks,"The controls are hard to use, it's almost imposible to order your units to attack enemy units because they move to fast. The 3D graphics are terrible and the sound is mediocre. The game says you can play multiplayer on 56K or better but you realy need DSL or something. The so called tricorder is imposible to use. The missions are way to hard and you can only save at the end of your mission so you'le end up playing for hours trying to finish. If you want good 3D strategy dont look here."
2,A bit of a letdown,"I guess I'll never learn about the latest incarnation of ""Star Trek"" games. I had earlier complained about ""Klingon Academy"", and now it's time to complain about his game. It was great at first, with the graphics and all, but now that I've had it for a while, it just about stinks. It took me forever just to complete the first mission. I've been on the second forever! I've managed to build the colony, mine the dilithium required, but I can never find that archeological area you're supposed to run science scans on. They need a strategy book for this game. It's just too hard to understand."
1,Worst Trek game made,"So, what was the point of this game? I never could distinguish the baddies from the Feds during alien battles. And, I could never finish the second mission. In my opinion, don't waste your hard earned money on this one. Total waste. If you're looking for fighting on a starship or beaming down to hostile worlds, this is not the game for you. You're better off with ""Bridge Commander"" or ""Elite Force""."
1,Only if you want to change cooler every year,"This product seemed great for 1 year. Has a date monitor, changeable filter. Hot and cold water dispense, and each has 4 temperature setting for both hot and cold. After 1 year the adjestment for temperature stopped working. That means no hot water nor cold water for both side of dispense. Only room temperature water for both side. I do not think this product should last for 1 year only. I understand that we had pleasure with this machine for 1 year, and since so many people is having similar mal disfunction on this product, I think the company should reinburse the consumers or in exchange for other models for a discounted price to keep the good name going."
1,Uses Replacement Filters that can't be bought,"You can't buy replacement filters for this device. That is, purchase the same filter that you get with it new. Instead you're supposed to use the standard pitcher filters...which you need a special adapter to make it work.That is, a free adapter, that brita does not have in stock, and is backordered on for an indeterminate amount of time on. We've had two different conversion kits on backorder since may 05 (that's 4 months).Two E-mails to the website went unanswered. Phone calls to the ""no customer service"" desktop say ""supervisors hope we'll have an answer to when we'll get them in in a couple weeks"". And this is how a multinational company does products? Makes a product, changes the consumables type, and doesn't make enough conversion parts to supply existing products."
3,Does anyone know where to get the filter conversion kit for this?,"I purchased one of these a few years ago and have been unable to find the replacement filter conversion kit.Brita stopped stocking them 3 months before I called them. I've been looking for a kit ever since. I've always used a jug so this was great while it lasted. Now I've been filling the bottle with jug water a few times a month.If you know where to find one please leave it in a review or something on the web with the phrase Brita water cooler conversion kit in it, I always search. Thanks."
1,Great 'til it leaked & ruined my wood floors!,We loved the delicious water - just heartbroken the slow leak ruined my oak floors. Hope the can fix that pesky leak 'cuz we'd like our nice water back.
1,Stops cooling after a year,I own two of these units and they both stopped cooling after a year. I looked for online trouble shooting but it only says to replace filters.If you only need something that works for a year this is the product for you.
1,"After 1 year, It LEAKS","This is the second Brita Water Cooler, both developed a slow leak after only one year. You will note that BRITA no longer sells this product. I understand why, product liability is huge. Do not buy this product unless you want to invest on a product that will leak in one year."
2,Well...I guess I'm a little luckier than most....,"We've had ours for probably 4-5 years. Soon after we purchased it, the bottle developed a leak. I tried to buy a replacement online but couldn't find one, so my son called Brita and they sent one out free! Was really pleased!!! But, now, several years later, it's leaking. Not the bottle, the actual cooler. I've taken it apart as much as I can without totally disassembling it and see the area where it leaks cannot be reached without totally disassembling. Also noticed quite a bit of rust, so it has probably been leaking slowly for awhile. It is no wonder they no longer make these. Will try to tighten the bolts inside the reservoir to at least slow down the leak while I save up to shop for another similar product. Too bad---we really liked it!!!! Anyone have any suggestions for a similar product?"
5,A Year Later & Still Loving This Water Cooler!,"Aside from looking like Darth Vader (& it's cousin looking like R2D2) -- I am very, very happy with this purchase! It's just perfect! Had this for a year now & have had zero problems with it. I love how easy it is to have great tasting water by simply using 2 replaceable Brita filters every few months. A prior reviewer is confused about the filters. The item comes with two start-up filters -- when it's time to replace them you just go to your local store & purchase two more regular brita filters. No biggie! Just that simple!I highly recommend this item!!! :-D"
2,Brita Bottle Leaked Caused Damage,"The water bottle that fits in the top of our Brita Water Cooler leaked and a full tank of water flooded our entry room and leaked down the wall into our finished walkout basement causing sheetrock and paint damage. This bottle is not durable, which makes me question the entire system. The cooler itself works OK but we are afraid to use it and we don't want to sell it to someone who may have the same problem. I would say keep it in the garage or do not buy one at all."
3,not much of a cooler any more,We really enjoyed this water cooler for a good year but soon after the cooling system seams to have stopped. The water is barely cool. I wanted to find a child safety lock for the cool side so the water doesn't get all over but since they stopped selling this system I most likely wouldn't be able to get this feature.
1,Broke immediatly (TWO TABLES)!,We purchsed this for our 5 and 6 year old daughters. Within 1 hour the table leg broke off and was broken. WE then purchased another...within 30 mins that table leg was also broken. My girls were playing tea party with their dolls and I was there so I know there were not at fault. TERRIBLE PRODUCT. Not worth the money and too bad becasue it is so cute and my girls LOVED it.
1,zero star product,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!! Table broke the minute my daughter used it. Exact same problem as all of the other reviewers--the base legs broke off. This is a defective product. After all of the negative reviews and complaints, Target should be ashamed for continuing to sell this product."
1,Poorly made table/ 0 stars for durability.,"The table legs broke off immediately. My daughter was very disappointed in her toy and her sister felt bad because it was a gift from her. Two sad girls, one lousy toy."
4,Stirring Scenes from the Life of Luther,A good two hour read for children ages 12 to 18. Adults get reaquainted with the hisory of the times and the stirring events that marked the start of the reformation. Enough detail to engage the most serious reader.
2,It's ok..,This did not work for me. it was supposed to be numbing and i just kept waiting for it to kick in....it never did. so basically i just got an extra bottle of lube
4,It works..,"This is good for the first timers and those who find it hard to receive anal.. I was one who could never get used to my husband's size.. but after using the anal lube along with graduating butt plugs, Im know taking his size like a pro.. I wouldnt suggest you use this with your man as it could desensitize him and prolong all the fun, unless he is using a condom.."
3,meh...,"I don't know if it's because you are supposed to wait before going through with what this lube is supposed to make more comfortable because The first time we used it, it was nice. However the second time- not so much. But I gave it 3 Stars because it is a velvety lube and not too sticky. Overall a decent product."
1,Just buy anal ezy,"The product is sticky, and non numbing or desensitizing. Only plus is you get a lot, however any store brand lube sold at Walmart would be better then this stuff. If you want less pain and longer erection get ""anal ez"" comes in smaller tube, but very very powerful stuff."
2,disaappointing product,"It is slippery and does a great job lubricating but, contains a desensitizer and as used reduces the feeling around your prostate. I am back to KY."
4,Good product,"The product works as advertised. But it is oil based to you will feel some irritation if it gets into a cut or sore. I highly advise to take strides to not get this product on the penis for it will numb it and you will become desensitized, and no this is not a good thing when you need ""attention"" for hours for something that should take a fraction of that time."
1,it don't work,"i would not waste to much time on it,let say i am still waiting for it to work.very disappointed for me i would say."
3,its alright,Its very sticky after a short while and doesn't ease enough of the pain for her so I gave it away but it helped a little so 3 stars
4,First of its kind!,"I got this game when it first came out. Compared to more contemporary games that take full advantage of the latest graphics cards, many people may be disappointed... and yes, it has a lot of bugs, but the creativity and the thrill of adventuring in a wilderness full of dangerous AI is awesome! There are moments when you will panic! They need to let Bethesda or Ravensoft do an update or sequel to work out all the bugs. They don't have to change much else!!!"
5,BEST GAME OF ALL TIME!!! WAS DELIVERED FAST!!!,This game is a must heve. It is so much fun to hunt dinosaurs. This is a must have.
1,Ug.,"I'm just writing this review so customers won't be confused by other reviews into buying this product. Maybe you (for some reason) enjoy stacking boxes into precarious staircases for hours and hours only to have to start over when they fall over, or perhaps you like fighting dinosaurs with buggy AI every half hour or so that you aren't stacking boxes, or maybe you think it's really funny that the dinosaurs frequently get their heads stuck in hillsides or fall from the sky or just stop their attacks for you to pet them. In any of these cases, you may consider buying this game. But otherwise, for your sake, please don't buy this game."
1,i feel kinda sorry for the people who made this game,"is the review writer ""Software User From Wisconsin""(the first review)being sarcastic? because the graphics are aweful, and dont get me started about bugs. they say that the dinosaurs came out of the movie, its ""the lost world"" not the spice girls music video.i dont know what an AMD is so i cant talk about it. anyway, it sucked so dont buy it."
1,Same as S53K (Only in Silver),"I got this product (S53K) after a long research. Put the first CD (The lord of the Rings) and image quality was disappointed. Up-conversion was the worst.Returned this product quickly and got and Oppo 981HD. What a difference!!If you are looking for a good DVD player don't buy this, instead buy an Oppo 981HD."
4,"I Never Felt This Way Before, etc. al.","This is the movie I could not get enough of when it was showing in the Tennessee Theatre and later on t.v. It is a great Christmas movie. ""All About Love"" and ""Someday Soon"" were the standouts of the movie, but ""I Never Felt This WayBefore"" showed an innocent Eddie, which was the opposite of what he actually way at that time. Debbie out-acted him as she was experienced (my, was she ever!) but she could not out-sing him ever. ""Tammy"" was a fluke. I have all three original albums, but I actually wrote to the movie studio wanting to buy the movie, was told they did not sell them to individuals. My, how times have changed! Eddie was so loveable, it's a shame it was all a sham, but so was their marriage on and off the screen."
2,Disappointing,"I read quite a few reviews before purchasing a gamepad. I haven't used one in probably 8 or 10 years but I recently went back to a simple 2D space combat game I used to enjoy and remember it was much better with a good gamepad than the keys on my laptop.I stayed away from the poorly rated ""super cheap"" gamepads out there and when I saw the decent reviews for this one I hoped it would be a happy medium.I can't imagine there are gamepads out there that feel ""cheaper"" than this. My biggest problem is the D pad, it seems to be a 4 way only directional pad, pressing a ""corner"" produces no movement in my game at all.Worse, even when I simply press left or right I have to REALLY press HARD for it to take sometimes, it is not nearly as responsive as it needs to be.Going to put this in a drawer I guess and buy one of the $40 pads, seems like that is overpriced for something like this though."
1,cheap but not worth the mone,"While it is inexpensive, if you play any games that need quick reaction forget it. Tried it on 3 PCs and 2 different operating systems. The buttons work fine but yiu can not turn right or left smoothly. If you play sports or fighting games don't waste your money"
4,Only reason is doesn't have a 5 is...,...doesn't have vibration function.Light weightCheapDurable (I've had mine for at least 2 years)Works great with emulators
4,"Cheap feel, but works good!",It functions well but feels a little cheap. For basic game play it works good.
3,It's What You Pay For,"On my computer I tend to play old NES, SNES, etc games so I don't need a joystick on a controller. If you want to play any games for PC or N64 and beyond, you'll need a more elaborate controller."
1,Shockingly bad....,Yeah this controller was alright for a few minutes but then started electrocuting me on the 3 button. I thought it was just my thumb but it happened several more times. It felt like touching an electric fence.I am returning this for I am not gonna be making a trip to the hospital. Anyone with a pacemaker do not buy this!
3,"Beautiful, not perfect","This is a good set of the piano concertos. However, the main problem is in the Fifth (Emperor): the second movement is extremely slow and faltering. This is one of the most beautiful pieces ever composed and the second movement MUST be perfect, as the version of Perahia: astonishing sensible, rhythmic.Having problems in the Fifth is almost unforgivable in a concert like this, and is the main reason to give only 3 stars instead of 5."
3,wished it was not a set,"All I can comment right now, is the performance of the Beethoven piano concerto 1 with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra was poor. The playing was stiff, the orchestra was below what they should be. I thought I even heard some off key notes from the band! Disappointed. Maybe I am just so used to how Martha Argerich plays it... However the rest of the discs are fantastic, what a contrast!!!!!!"
5,The perfect ingredients to Beethoven's piano concertos!,"Yep, we have super-conductor Georg Solti with his powerful Chicago Symphony Orchestra, and soloist Vladimir Ashkenazy, all teaming up to bring out a well orchestrated set of Beethoven's piano concertos. With crisp London/Decca sound, you can have the volume on your stereo at full blast and experience nothing but the clear powerful sound of Ashkenazy's innocent piano and Solti's devilish Chicago Symphony Orchestra pumping out great bursts of beautiful Beethoven sound. The star of the set here is Piano Concerto No. 5 in E flat major, op. 73 ""Emperor."" Most considerably to be the finest account of Beethoven's concertos. With it's fine translation of royal beauty, struggle, and heroics. Experience it for yourelf at the bargain of a price!"
2,Didn't think they were going to be this bad,"I had my warnings from the below review but bought these for their price and style. They sound terrible, no bass, and muffled highs. I didn't think they would sound that bad with ten but I guess I was wrong. I don't even think five would be a good price for this garbage. They don't even fit right. Just avoid and get the Philips brand."
5,"please take a look at the price 9,999.99","9,999.99 for some ehadphones please fix this errer and please let me know when u fix this problem"
1,Awful.,The sound quality is terrible (no bass and grainy trebble) and they hurt if you wear them for longer than 30 seconds. I bought these headphones and returned them the following day. Avoid at all costs. Spend a few extra bucks and buy the Sony MDR-G42LP Street Style Headphones. They are far superior.
4,Useful guide to understanding building process,"I got this book from the local library, decided it was well worth having to keep. Full of useful tips on what the architect and general contractor really do, and may of the process pitfalls that can lead to delays, higher costs and unpleasant surprises.You want this book early since it even helps determine the right professionals for your project."
4,limitless possiblities for flights,"With a few simple codes, you can fly any thing from 'Air Force One' to 'V-22 Osprey' to a 'B-2 Stealth Bomber' to a forward wing design aircraft to a Tomcat. It even has a reference section with so much information on aircraft and other machines that it has be on a separate disc from the rest of the game!"
4,Anthology,"STRAP yourselves in boy's and girl's cause the G's are pullin at ya....and if that ain't doin it then the game will.Have fun, I know I am......."
2,Go for Armored Fist 2,I found that Armored Fist 2 has better controls. It is also better for beginners. The console in Armored Fist 3 has been hidden and it is hard to play.
4,A pretty decent armored cav sim,"Armored fist 3 is a fairly decent game based on the M1A2 Abrahms tank. The game's controls are very easy to understand and the inside of the tank looks awesome. The amount of detail is fairly well displayed seeing as different enemy units require differnt types of ammuunition. Also driving the tank is very important in combat because the enemy can taget the back of the tank and take you out with one shot. The requirements are fairly low, I run it on windows xp and an Nvidia geforce with 32mb and it runs with no problems at all. The graphics are so so if you can imagine the graphics from the first Delta Force you have the graphics from armored fist 3."
3,Pretty cool game,"It's not bad as far as graphics go and it's pretty fun, but some levels are so easy it gets boring rather quickly. Some levels are rather difficult and it gets somewhat addicting. 3 stars"
3,Not that great,"Not the great quality I have seen from Novalogic. Check out the Delta Force line of product for some great fun and hours, and I mean literally hours of entertainment. I would like to see them do some major overhaul work on this one."
5,Coltrane's best? Prestige Profiles # 9,"I read that when this recording/show ended, Coltrane was on his knees on the band stand, tears rolling down his face, the audience left in stunned silence. I had to order it....it is everything advertised and more. It is my second favorite Coltrane, behind only of 'Kind of Blue'. Jim, Nashville."
2,Mediocre,"With so much outstanding Coltrane music available, it's disappointing to listen to the Prestige repackaging of their archives of the major talents of the 50's. Some of the tracks here are really quite nice - Russian Lullaby and Trane's Slo Blue stand out - but these are overshadowed by the sessions that put Coltrane in a quintet/sextet grouping with such dim bulbs as Sahib Shiab and Idrees Sulieman. Lackluster performances also come in from Donald Byrd, Cecil Payne, and Pepper Adams. The best cuts are the quartet with Red Garland, Paul Chambers, and Arthur Taylor. The big problem, however, is the ""house band"" feeling to the album, with Coltrane just one of the front men. That's disappointing."
5,Great toy!,"My 4 & 3 year olds received this for Christmas last year-they love it! There's 5 different 'mini cd's' which the child can switch to. Once again, Leap Frog has outdone themselves by creating an extremely educational, entertaining toy."
4,great learning toy,I finally found this toy at a store on black friday! I have been looking for it because it is made by leapfrog and every toy that my son has from them he loves. My 2 1/2 year old loves it. He already has the leapfrog letter factory DVD so he really enjoys the letter songs on the karaoke machine. It is a very well made toy. It is a great buy!
4,great toy for preschoolers,"I bought the learning screen karaoke for my 3 year old son. And he loved it when we first got it. He still plays with it, but the initial obsession with it is over. I do not like the fact that there is not a setting for them to sing with their own voice, the button just makes their voice sound funny. Which is cute, but sometimes I would like for him to hear himself naturally. I would def. recommend this toy. I really like leap frog products & this one lives up to leap frog standards. I would also buy this toy as a gift. Esp. for the cost - it is a good buy!"
4,Great fun for the next American Idol,Great fun for the little entertainer. I would recommend removing the microphone (long cord) if your child is under 3 years old.
4,My son loves this toy!,"My son received this toy for his 3rd birthday and he loves it! He carried it around with him all day and even brought it to bed with him that night. The songs are great but I do wish they sang the words to the popular kids songs. Although I don't find it especially educational, it's a great toy for a child who loves to listen and sing along to music."
5,Another great leapfrog product!,"I found this for my 3 year old daughter and thought it would be perfect since she loves music, boy was I right! she loves performing her favorite songs for everyone and she has learned her days of the week and is counting backwards just by singing these songs! I recomend this to anyone. The only drawback is it is a bit loud and the kids have to remember to press the button on the microphone for it to work, but overall it was well worth the money!"
1,My daughter couldn't hear herself sing.,The volume for the microphone is so low that it is hard to hear the child singing. Also the microphone cord when moved causes static and if the mic is too close to the speaker it will cause high pitch noices. Lastly the voice comes out sounding muttled and that is not when I was using the voice effect.
3,Its only okay,"This toy seemed to have a lot of the qualities a 2 year old would need. Durable, learning and fun. The durable part is okay, but the microphone and speaker quality is not good. There is no true learning quality to this toy. I know my son is a little young for this toy, but he has figured out my cd, dvd, and television including remotes so electronically this toy is not a challenge. Learning music might be a little better, but you really need a song book to be a true learning toy. My son has a very long attention span for toys that challenge him and unfortunately this is not one of them. He plays with this toy for about 5 minutes and then moves on. The only great part of this toy was the price as it was on sale. This toy is only okay."
3,learning screen karaoke,"It was an ok machine, the girls were young when i bought it and loved to sing but they soon tired from it for it wasn't as exciting of a toy for them so sorry i had to give it a lower mark we soon gave it away to a church for the children to play with in their nursery."
1,Received a LEMON,"I bought this item from Amazon as a Christmas present for my niece. It arrived broken and I believe they have sent me a returned item!!! The reason I think they have sent me a used item is because it arrived with batteries already installed. From my past experience, if a manufacturer is kind enough to include batteries they would include unused batteries packed inside the box with the toy and not installed in it becuase anyone with some sense would know an installed battery would drain quickly and if left in a toy long enough it would ruin the toy completely. I feel so bad having to have my busy relative to go through the trouble of returning a Christmas present."
4,It takes some getting used to,It is amazing how much pounding that this piece of plastic can take. At first I was afraid I would break it but as I went on pulling bullets it withstood ever increasingly hard strikes. While the process was slow at first I quickly established a pace that sped up the process. I pulled everything from 500 Smith and Wesson to .223. Some reloads I tried to pull had extreme crimping and those got pulled in my loading press. The only glitch I had was that the little rubber strip that held the collett together worked loose but a call to Hornady fixed the problem. This little gadget soon pays for itself.
4,Young Child in the Family and the Community,"I received the book that I ordered, which arrived in good condition. However, I was a little disappointed, because I paid for two-day shipping and it arrived in the same amount of time as if I had selected either the Free Shipping or 3-5 day shipping. But, I did receive the item, and it was in good condition, so I was happy that it did in fact arrive."
4,12 Steps to a Healthier Life!,I am a 23 year old adult child of abuse and addiction of all types...recently I have looked to many different outlets for help...including addiction myself- when I realized that I was starting on the same path (Thank God I caught it early!) I picked this book up at the store. I started reading it a little while ago and since then have a whole new look on life...I am now getting the help I need and seeking some friends with the same issues that I have so we can lean on eachother if needed. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is feeling lost and has had the same or maybe (God forbid!) worse experiences than I have had.
5,Escada Magnetism perfume,This perfume smells so good and thank you Amazon for having it available and shipping it so fast to me.Thank you again for all your good services.Lynn
2,Put Ashkenazy aside,"Ashkenazy lacks the feeling for Chopin's music. Behind all of his quick fingerwork and clean passages there is nothing. For those of you out there looking for some referance recordings of Chopin I advise you to listen to other pianists such as Rubinstein, Cortot, Gilels, Kapell, Kissin, even Richter (I would be more careful, but damn is the Fourth Ballade sublime) or Rachmaninoff (his recording of the B flat minor Sonata has never been surpassed). These pianists pour much more emotion and beauty into their playing, and their interpretations are backed by a technique that would make Ashkenazy's seem like nothing. Maybe Ashkenazy should quit his table-strumming and just stick to conducting."
2,Gum Drops,"I was very disappointed in the Gum drops that I recently purchased. They were hard and really not the ones that I thought they were. I thought they were the small ones. I can only purchase the small ones here in Huntington, In. that are spice, not the plain ones. The ones that I purchased did't say that they were spice, so I assumed they were the plain ones. I guess that what they say about assuming is true. Even though they were the Big Gum drops they shouldn't have been as hard as they were, they were uneatable and I will not buy any candy over the internet anymore."
4,Foot note to alan brain review,"The DDG cd Ancerl's Czech Philh. version is more intense, but no longer available. Amazon has it on another label,under Ancerl gold edition vol 13."
5,Boys and Girls,"Respectfully recognizing previous reviewers, of this two-disc set, the Requiem is done by mature women singing at full throttle.The Mass in D is done by a boys' choir. Quite a contrast."
2,A so-so product,"Purchased for crimping spark plug wires. For about $18 delivered one might expect a fairly robust construction, but the metal is thin enough so that the resulting flex causes the two arms to misalign. This is expensive in my opinion for an el-cheapo, and it's not good enough to compete with better crimpers. There are no instructions on usage and one has to guess how to use it for crimping spark plug wires."
1,disappointing,What a disappointment. The Escada for men is wonderful and I hoped to find the same with the women's. Not the case. This smells like something left out in the sun too long. Wish I had saved my money.
1,Don't Bother With This Book,"Don't waste your money. Buy one of the other more reputable repair manuals on the market. This book tells you all kinds of things that you should worry about doing, but VERY LITTLE about how to actually do them.Please note that the company, Buster's Marine, was great to deal with, very fast shipping, but this book is virtually useless.Very Disappointing!!!"
5,The best investment for a good night sleep!!!!!!,When I bought this I was so happy to see that it had a timer where you can choose how long you want the music to play. The peaceful aquarium we had before this never played long enough to put him to sleep. The music and screen is adorable! You have to buy this for yourself or as a gift. You will not be sorry!!!!
5,Great for Both Children,"I originally bought this for my son when he was one year old, and his original musical toy broke. He absolutely loved it then and still does at 2/12. I bought a second one for my daughter before she was born. This toy helps soothe both children to sleep, and lessens the bedtime hassle. I absolutely love the fact that you can choose between 3 different time settings, the longest being 20 minutes of play (most toys only offer 5 or 10 minutes). This means that I don't have to keep entering the room to turn the toy back on. I would highly recommend this to any parent who is having difficulty at bedtime. It certaintly helped me."
4,It put my daughter to sleep,"I got this as a gift when my daughter was born. at first only the sound put her to sleep. then as she gets older the light start to get her attention. I love that it has a sound volume. and a 5, 15 and 20 timer on it. not a must have but it does put my little one to sleep"
5,Can't live without it!!!,"This is one of the ""must haves"".My baby is 7 month now and she has loved it ever since we bought it (she was 2 month). We turn it on every night and she'll fall right asleep. If she would wake up in the middle of the night-- we turn it on and she will fall asleep with in 5 minutes.It has 5, 15, or 20 minutes playtime-you can also turn off the ""TV monitor"" and just have the music playing."
5,Great for children scared of the dark.,"We purchased this toy for my one year old who won't go to sleep with the lights off. He love to watch the pictures stroll by as he likes the toy lighting up his crib. Bedtime goes much smother with the Slumbertime Gloworm on. The music is very comforting and find myself falling asleep to the music. We liked the timer so that if he need the full 20mins to get to sleep and other nights the 5mins are fine. The only thing is that it ""eats"" batteries fairly fast and they get pretty expensive. I would recommend getting some rechargable batteries as you will be going through a lot of them!"
4,Wonderful,"I bought this because I could not find the Aquarium for the crib, and boy am I glad I did. First of all it can stay on for up to 20 minutes, sometimes it takes that long for my daughter to settle down. Second the picture constantly moves, this keeps her interested longer. And third, the music is actually nice to listen to. My daughter just loves it and she tries to turn it on herself now when she wakes up at night. Unfortunately I still have to do that for her. Definately worth the $."
1,Unsafe,"My daughter is 7 months old and today was able to unhook one side of this toy from her crib. She was still going at it when I checked on her. Thank goodness she didn't get the other side off. It would have fallen on her head. It is a fun toy, but unsafe."
3,"OK, but not great","My daughter likes this but doesn't love it. Some of the songs are a bit creepy, I wonder why they picked such strange songs. And she doesn't fall asleep when it is playing, so what is the point? The lights and 'moving screen' is a bit cheesy, I recommend buying a CD player instead."
3,Daughter loves to fall asleep to the music,"We received this toy along with a gloworm, when our daughter was 4 months old. She is now 18 months old and can turn the music on and off by herself. If she wakes in the night, I can hear the music playing from her crib and she goes back to sleep. My main issue was that the pages don't light up anymore(we even got a replacement bulb from the manufacturer, but it only worked for 1 day) but now I'm glad they don't work because they were pretty bright. The glow from the face is just enough light in her crib and the music is very soothing for her."
5,my boy loves this,"I got this as a gift and the glow worm scared me when it was lit. I thought it would frighten my boy, but I was wrong. He loves this. It calms him down when he's riled up and it entertains him endlessly. I love this gift now, as it has been a life saver many times."
1,Not durable at all,"The slumbertime gloworm was given to my baby as a gift together with the new gloworm doll. The light was not working so we could not see the pictures from the screen even if we could hear music playing. Since it was purchased abroad and sent to us, we could not replace the bulb. So, we purchased a similar bulb in the hardware and it worked for a few days before the lights went out again. Now it's sitting in our closet almost never been used! The new Gloworm doll was ok though."
4,Almost Perfect,"From a production standpoint this has to be one of the best albums I have ever heard. Lyrically, is where this album comes up short. Don't get me wrong, the lyrics are far from terrible and i'll be going into a second straight summer playing the album regularly. All the beats on Popular Demand are very refreshing and doubt that this would be a disappointment."
2,are you kidding me??,"this has got to be the most overhyped record i've bought lately. this is so bland it's unbelievable that it was put out by such a good label. if this is the direction people want hip hop to go in, than you all deserve the crapfest you're going to get. the beats are sooooooo weak i have no clue why people compare him to jay dee. on top of that the rhymes are just total garbage.if you want to listen to GOOD hip hop, just go pick up some one.be.lo."
5,Outstanding Performance and Recording,"A potential cornerstone of any Beethoven collection, this DG recording of the Emerson Quartet provides not only technical brilliance in recording technology, but also reveals a performance by the group that is not only faithful to the score, but is also simultaneously heartwarming and intellectually stimulating. These artists have obviously polished their form to a high level of sophistication, and anyone interested in string quartets in general and Beethoven in particular would likely rate this set as a valuable addition to their personal collection."
1,Defective Disks Make for Poor Listening Experience,"Play ALL of your disks immediately if you purchase from this seller! This seller doesn't appear to care if your merchandise is defective. This is an eight-CD set received as a Christmas present. Two of the disks are defective and have places where the get ""stuck"" and the same short phrase plays over and over necessitating skipping the track to listen to the rest of the quartet. I filed a complaint with the seller as soon as I was aware of the defect, and the seller responded saying simply that I was ""outside of the return window"" (although according to Amazon, I was inside the ""window""). Buyer beware!"
2,insensitive and unfeeling,"This set of quartets is very well played indeed, but somehow one can feel a strange indifference and coldness in the interpretations. Everything seems so insensitive and unfeeling and even the most beautiful Cavatina lacks the romantic anguish that is so wonderfully produced in some other recordings. There is a feeling that the only goal Emersons have here is to show how well they can play. I can't recommend it."
2,Too Analytical,"Maybe I'm not the most qualified person to be writing a review on these works. I have to confess that after hearing these quartets performed by a number of ensembles, I just can't hear what all the brouhaha is about. Maybe I'm listening incorrectly or something, but to me the string quartets are simply not on the same level as Beethoven's symphonies and piano sonatas. (I can hear a collective gasp from music-lovers around the world.) That said, I'm not so ambivalent that I can't prefer one performance of these works over another. Alas, the Emerson's quartets would not rank highly on my list. Technically the Emersons are amazing and their sonority is perfect. And yet, their playing seems to lack any kind of emotional attachment to the music. The performances therefore come off as rather cold and analytical. I like more passion in my music, particularly in these works. But like I said, maybe I'm not the perfect judge."
5,cotton candy is so sweet!,"i have set this aside for my daughter for christmas, she is only 2 and a half but i know she will like it, (and i do too, hehe), at first i hesitated because it looked like there were lots of small parts but the only small parts are the 2 teacups and the 2 cake slices (i plan to put these away till she's a bit older) the other small things shown in the picture here are just stickers/decals. this toy is incredibly cute and like another reviewer said, its not flimsy. the magnetic feature is a good idea and i know my daughter will love it. the set also comes with 10 my little pony points (see MLP website about what you can get free by collecting these) 10 points is pretty neat i thought considering the individual ponies come with just 2 points. i cant wait to play with this, oops i mean i cant wait for my daughter to play with it."
4,My daughter is thrilled with this!,For Christmas she (4-3/4 yrs old) wanted My Little Pony. Anything from the line would do as she had nothing previously. She received this as an early holiday gift and is just crazy about it. It is the last thing she plays with before bed and the first thing in the morning. She took it to school for show and tell. The cardboard pop out things are weird to me but I'm not a 4 year old. Seems durable enough.
4,ok,"my three year old daughter likes this toy. it is fun but the the railing falls off and my daughter and i get fustrated with the oven. the oven on ours will not stay shut, none of the other reviews have said anything about this so it must not be a commom problem. my daughter really likes the tea cups and cake part and has pony tea parties so over all it is a good toy."
3,Very Poor Quality !!!!!!!,"My twin daughters are very frustrated by the turrets falling off every time they touch the castle (they do not ""snap"" into place). The crown and the plastic heart never stay on and my daughters can't move the elevator up with out me. I struggle to get the elevator to move my self. I was EXTREMELY disappointed with the quality of this toy!"
4,Accessible and Comprehensive,"The majority of the essays are well-written in an approachable rhetoric that can be understood by a reader with relatively limited knowledge of the subject-matter. It also serves as a concise anthology of essays written by some of the leading critical thinkers in this area, making this both an excellent introductory book as well as a collection worthy to be on the expert's shelf."
3,"""Quick! What the hell is this PoMo you speak of?""","Collection of essays on postmodernism and various examples thereof. Consumed this particular text during my 2000-2001 stint at SMCM, working my way through my SMP, trying to create reasonably plausible art students in my novel."
5,"Great Game, Excellent Sound","Delta Force is a very good game. It's gameplay is extremely fun, and it has a short learning curve. Multiplayer is also extremely fun, and I've had no trouble participating on the Novaworld Network. The sound is just plain wonderful, you litteraly don't need to look at the screen to see whether a bullet just flew past your right or left side. The only downside is the graphics, and they're still okay. It's not Rainbow Six quality, but 800x600 mode is fairly descent. The gameplay is probably the real reason why the game is so addictive, if you want something more complex then a shoot 'em up game, and a little downsized from the extreme complexity of Rainbox Six, this is your game."
4,Good Game...coulda been alot better,"Of course, it was a good game, fun, and even addictive. Some interesting improvements include the more advanced AI of the enemies than was the case in the first ""Delta Force"". It's also more realistic than the first one: i.e. hiding inside a canvas tent won't protect you from the cannon fire from a Hind. Using several parachute sequences made it much more enjoyable and interesting. A big problem, however, was that when you looked at your GPS map, you could still move you man but you couldn't turn his direction. This proved to be a major irritation all throughout gameplay. Furthermore, inclusion of a shotgun was nothing but absurd, unrealistic, and totally unnecessary. Also, the manual and Help screens are very unclear on how to climb down ladders. As the heading says, it was good, but by fixing only a few minor details they could have made it a lot better."
4,Finally!,"Finally I found a 3D commando soldier simulation with an interface that can be mastered in 2 minutes without sacrifizing realism.I love it. The graphics, the gameplay, the missions, the controls and different objects, vehicles, weapons and so on.Four stars seems a little bit cheap for this great game, but the fifth star is missing because I would have liked to see a greater variety of campaigns, for example with different identities/themes. But still it is worth every penny."
2,Maybe I'm Nuts....,"It seems that most of the people who played this game liked it. And I must say that when I got it, I was expecting a better experience than I got, something along the lines of Rainbow Six with more running and shooting. However, as opposed to most of the reviews I saw, Delta Force was a huge dissapointment. With horrible graphics (Maybe it's my computer, but they didn't even have a strafing animation or realistic grass) and stupid extras as weapons (see the pathetic explosion from a strike) the game was a massive waste of money. I'm beginning to think that everone likes it because it's so cheap."
1,Bad Graphics,"Let me start by saying that I'm a loyal Delta Force (DF) player. I've played every one in the series so far. This is the only game in the series that I've regretted purchasing.DF1 was a software-rendered game. It didn't rely on OpenGL (hardware) and other stuff like that. DF2, on the other hand, is the first OpenGL game in the series. It seems very dark and kind of slow. Maybe it works better on some video cards, but it didn't work that well on my TNT2.I'd recommend getting Land Warrior (DF3), which also has hardware support, but none of the issue of DF2. Or, get one of the newer ones in the series. As of the time of this writing, Black Hawk Down (DF5) is what I'm currently playing (and the newest in the series)."
1,"Stick to Rainbow Six, Soldier of Fortune, If you want good.","Really. This game is not that good. The graphic are choppy, the gameplay gets kind of boring after about thirteen minutes, and its about the same as Rainbow Six or even the original Delta Force. So, don't waste money on this. Spend it on Land Warrior, or Soldier of fortune. Not this."
4,Could Be Better... Get Black Hawk Down,"Delta Force is a mostly a good game. The gameplay is very fun, the sound is realistic, and the graphics are ok. However, if you have a good system, then don't bother. Black Hawk Down is a better game, and it's beautiful. But if you like FPS, have a lousy machine, and don't mind a one shot kill (even if you shoot someone in the scope of their gun), get Delta Force 2."
1,The best game I have ever played......NOT !,"Get it through your head THIS GAME stinks First of all the graphics suck,boring gameplay(I usually like realistic military games), coudn't acess campaign, takes forever to install.I would give this game 0 stars. I just bought it about 1 hour ago played it for 15 min. and then got bored... Try the Unreal series , half life or rainbow 6"
2,AARRGGHH!,"I think that if you have a super-fast PC, and you dig this stuff, get a demo. I don't have a 32 MB video card, so the frame rates were very choppy. I'm just pissed. I'm going to return it ASAP and get something else."
3,okay game,"Delta 1 was an awesome game. This follow-up was okay, the graphics were average, but the missions were sooo easy. I beat the entire game in 3 or 4 days. The really frustrating thing was that i couldnt control my teammates. The commands are like something like ""Cover fire"" or ""resume mission"" which gives you no options at all. You have to singlehandedly beat the missions."
4,A GREAT ADDITION TO ANYONES COLLECTION,"This game is a great game to own because the graphics are great and the missions are great because I think there's 41 missions.Each mission you have to be on the look out for bad guys and hostages. The game hardly freezes-up and multiplayer is the best. Novalogic is the key to multiplayer. The arsenal of weapons is superb and shooting them are cool. When shooting with a sniper from a distance you have to cock your weapon up so the round can go up and come down on your enemy. If you buy the game and are a cheater and cheat in multiplayer, beware. Over all the game is awesome and I suggest who ever has the time to read this should diffenalty conseder buying it."
4,not very fun but awsome weapons!,"I play a lot of first person shooters, and this isn't a very good game but it is ok. First I will tell you about the good things. The best thing on this game is the AI. For example if I accidently fired my gun you will hear yelling and shooting in the backround. One more good thing is the weapons, even though there aren't a lot they are awesome. The weapons avalibale are: M4 with shotgun, M4 with gernade launcher, Heckler and Koch MP5 sub machine gun, M249 Saw, M40a1 sniper rifle, Barret Light .50 sniper rifle, and 5.56 underwater assault rifle. As you can see these are some pretty cool weapons!! One more thing that makes this game grreaat is the multiplayer The bad things are the audio. For example i fire my asault rifle and 5 seconds later it makes the sound!! And this game takes forever to load!!But over all, this game is ok"
4,"Good game, but Short",I really enjoyed this game but it was over before I could really enjoy it. Very limited number of missions in the storyline and the individula missions are the same as the story.
1,Not worth it.,"The FPS genre isn't in danger of have greatness redefined by DF2. The graphics and controls are decent, meaning that you can generally distinguish targets and terrain and the movement isn't difficult to master. The fundamentals of the game are sound in that the solo missions are satisfying, the campaigns follow the same theme as the solo's, but it's the multiplayer that is the biggest let down. Unfortunately there are cheat codes that find their way into the multi-play. So, for example, if you are playing flagball and someone is using speed-cheat, forget it, the game is over. And there is almost always at least one person cheating. Artillery support in King of the Hill is equally ruinous of any fun.I definitely wish I had picked up another game. Once you get tired of the solo work, which is quick, the multiplay is so dissappointing that there is no long term value in the game. Wait for something better."
3,Somewhat Disappointing,"I really enjoyed Playing Delta Force, and I thought that DF2 would be a souped-up version of the first. The graphics are ok, and the campaign missions are original, but the game is so incredibly laggy. It ruined it for me, because the game simply doesn't run as smooth as the first. If they can get rid of the bugs with this one it will be awesome."
2,Disappointing,"As a huge fan of the original Delta Force, I was eagerly awaiting the release of Delta Force 2. I must say that I was sadly disappointed. I expected some improvements over the original. Granted that you have new weapons and a little more functionality, the game falls far short of what I was expecting. This should of been an expansion pack to the original. I have shelved it after only playing it a hand full of times. My advice, borrow a friends copy and check it out before wasting $$ on a retail version."
2,"Umm, wtf","(. . .) The graphics are less than mediocre, internet play is nearly impossible with the lag. Plus there are so many cheaters, it makes it horrible. Plus if you have pre- Pentium 3, you'll encounter this uncontrollable error that you can only fix by Disabling NETBIOS. The other opinions are probably from people paid by Novalogic. Bottom Line- Don't buy this, buy something half-decent like Rainbow-Six, or R6-Rogue Spear. Hope this honesty helps."
2,Notice to pet lovers....new data has shown severe allergic reactions by some dogs to D-Limonene.,"New incidental data coming in shows that this chemical, made from citrus peels, can burn the skin tragically, and affect internal organs of dogs who may be bathed in this as a cleaning shampoo homemade mixture. It does work wonders on pet odors but at least two dogs have almost died from coming into contact with this serious cleaning solvent. Check Youtube for story about a Pomeranian named Ginger, whose plight started the alarm posts coming in from around the country.Pet groomers are advised NOT to clean their equipment, tubs, tools, etc, with this cleaning solvent and NOT to mix it with shampoo to use on pets. The damage to skin and coats are chemical burns but internal damage can affect the kidneys and the blood system."
2,"fair, but not exceptional","Although Tchaikovsky intended his liturgy for church performance, it is given a rather secular performance in this recording. The singing is in tune, but the basses are barely existent and the sopranos are consistently overpowering. Even though the entire liturgy is not complete on this CD, it does, however, feature 7 of Tchaikovsky's ""9 Sacred Choral Works"" which are not often recorded."
3,Good but not incredible,"First of all, I'm amazed that Damnation ADs whole catalog is now on Amazon. That's incredible. This one is cataloged wrong however. The jade tree albums are attributed correctly to Damnation AD and this one to just Damnation. Searching for Damnation AD won't bring this one up.But anyway, about the album. This album has all the production value and sense of purpose that No More Dreams of Happy Endings should have had but the songs just aren't as powerful as the songs on that album. Also, on a couple tracks the vocals are obnoxiously over-produced and in general Mike DCs voice doesn't sound as good as it has on other records. That said, this album does have a few gems. ""The Mortal"" sounds more like the Damnation AD that I love, it's also the only one of these songs that I've heard live. ""Circles"" is just amazing. If you're already a fan, this album is probably worth it, if you're just getting into Damnation AD, I'd probably go for Misericordia first."
2,Math Skills,"I bought the DVD because the reviews were good but was disappointed. The students thought it was ""boring"". The speaker did just that, speak. He drew diagrams on a whiteboard and they were not as clear as they should have been. The DVD is informative but not exciting."
5,Good for both young and old fans,"This book collects the first four issues of the excellent X-men:Evolution comic. Unlike some other books based on TV series, this is not a rehashing of what you can watch on the DVD, but independent stories (namely the origin stories of Storm, Wolverine, Cyclops, and Jean in this volume) which complement the series.What I liked best about this book was that it appealed to all ages. On the surface it's a kids book - bright colors, clear lines, and nothing objectionable in its content. There was also a surprising depth to the writing and characters as well as good pacing and comic timing which will appeal to adults. It's a light fun read with enough depth to be satisfying."
4,Enjoyable,"The first volume of this series is quite enjoyable, with good art, colors, and stories. However, the second volume is not nearly as good as the first. The art is of the same quality, but the story lines are muddled and confusing. I can truly recommend only volume 1 of this pairing to any but extremely hard-core fans. Save the money you would have spent on Vol. 2 and use it to buy one of the Evo DVDs."
5,from the WB's series,"If you liked the WB series X-Men: Evolution (which was rather well done) you'll enjoy this as well. It covers the origin of all the characters. That is, how Prof. X found all of them. It's a nice start to the comic series."
4,"Very good, but","I think Schiff plays these sonatas very well, though personally I find them a bit on the dry side. My choice for this music is Eschenbach, but that is an admittedly biased position, and anywone interested in this area of Mozart's work should listen to all recordings if possible. However, please beware of ANY reviewer or publication that claims that a particular performance is ""perfect"" or ""definitive."" That's just nonsense - there is no such thing as a perfect or definitive recording; some of course are better than others, but there's always a chance that an even better performance is waiting in the wings. Listen and decide for yourself."
3,lacklustre and dry performance!!!,"listening to three of these sonatas(k331,k332 and k333)on an ELOQUENCE label by Schiff was a dreary and dull experience.i thought of sampling Schiff's performance after going through the rave reviews but it was disappointing to say the least.No joy,no playfulness!i have listened to some excellent recordings of these pieces by the late Clara Haskil on the radio-very graceful and playful.I also like to draw attention to some excellent playing by the Soviet pianist Mikhail Pletnev (perhaps on a melodya label)of mozart's sonatas.they are a joy to listen with adroit twists and turns typical of Mozart!"
4,"this is a collection, not a selection...","So you can't argue for it. For being what it is, it's quite nice. Don't forget that this has nothing to do with Beethoven sonatas, and the present conception that we have from Beethoven is that should sound sharper and in a more mechanical way, like an organ. This Mozart interpretation was concieved and thought more or less in the original way (more or less because this is played on a modern piano but Schiff is playing like a period instrument, from my point of view). Some people likes earlier sounds, some others prefer modern ones. So, i repeat, this is a collection and it has consistent quality, which is basic for a complete cycle."
1,Dreary Sonatas,"After listening to the first CD of the Schiff set I knew that he really disliked Mozart. The piano sonatas of Mozart require a light touch and very little use of the sustaining pedal and that is not what I have heard in this set. Many sonatas have also been played either too fast or too slow, like the Durnitz sonata. If you are looking for a good recording of the Mozart piano sonatas I recommend Barenboim's set because his style conforms to the change in musical feeling in Mozarts time, the beginning of the change from late classical to early romantic."
4,One of the longest toys running in my son's collection.,"My son is 15 months and still figuring out that the song changes unless he is holding the one side straight up, but his favorite is the peek a boo parrot and he can sit and play with it for at least 15 minutes at a time a few times a day. He loves that he can make the music go on himself and doesn't need us to push it (like other toys) he giggles constantly while playing with this. My favorite is the African Lion and he knows it, so when I come in the room he will turn it that side, look at me, smile and try to dance to the music."
5,One of my twins favorites!!!,"My twin girls received this as a Christmas gift when they were 6 months old. They are now 9 months, and they play with the Melody Block daily. The music is much better than the other electronic toys we have, and there is always the option to turn it off (hallelujah!) They both get the biggest smiles on their faces when the music starts, and they love turning the block over and over to hear all of the different tunes. Definately a must-have for the under 1 crowd!"
3,"Annoying, yes, but not sensitive to touch","The block plays a rhyme or song based on which side of the block is facing up. If this toy were truly ""birth +"" it would be better if it WERE sensitive to touch! That way a baby who is still too young to sit up can hear the song or rhyme of the side of the block facing her, and it would continue to play as she explores the features of that side of the block!"
3,"argh, this is annoying!","This seems like a great idea, but in actuality its kind of annoying because if you touch any two sides of the block at once, you hear bits and pieces of two songs. When my son holds the block, he uses two hands and if he turns it at all, you hear snippets of the other songs as well. Its really, really sensitive to touch. Otherwise, its cute to look at, and it has moveable fabric pieces that are also attached, so they arent a risk for swallowing. I turned the sound off, but for $20, its a lot for a block."
2,Rubbish.,"If you want to hear some of the finest in Italian progressive rock go to PFM, Banco Del Mutuo Soccorso, Le Orme, Locande Delle Fate and Museo Rosenbach. This recording is a vastly overated piece of rubbish. The vocals are overblown and grating. They come across as pseudo-operatic bombast. The musicianship is competent but definately not inspired. They sound as if they are a group of assembled studio musicians attempting to record progressive music. The compositions and production are dated, stiff and uninteresting. Don't bother with this one...Simon"
2,Good but not great,"This book is good--certainly better than many college admissions books--but it's far from being great. First, while much of the advice seems solid, the details are sparse. We could use more facts and examples to back up the advice. Second, while the author has some opinions on colleges, he doesn't explain many of them. Allen, in College Admissions Trade Secrets, has loads of strong opinions but usually explains them and gives facts to back them up. Third, what about the kids who just want to go to Harvard or Princeton? Taylor's advice is often more ""why do you want to go to Harvard?"" than helping kids understand how to get into Harvard. Once again, if you want insider tips for getting into a top college, you'll need to buy a book by Allen, Hernandez or perhaps Toor. Taylor's book does a great job of convincing applicants that being rejected from Yale isn't the end of the world -- but other books do a better job of explaining how to get admitted to Yale."
5,Noooooooooooooooooooooooooo,Very end sad but her excitingYou should read it. To good to not readThere is more battles and it is better
5,"Forest of Secrets by ""Lightstar""","They're all sooo good! Fireheart is still struggling over Tigerclaw's treachery, Graystripe's passionate affair with Silverstream, and Cinderpaw's lost future because of her injury. Oh, and the mischievous Cloudkit/Cloudpaw. Still, the ending's sooo good. Even though poor Silverstream who just HAD to die! At least her kits (later on Feathertail and Stormfur) survive. Anyway read this one. It's soo suspenseful! And it's soo cool that Fireheart became the Clan deputy."
5,THIS BOOK RULES!!!!,"Warriors- Forest of Secrets is an awesome book! I own every book in the series so far and this one is the best so far!For one, the prologue in the beginning-well, I thought Oakheart had still been alive. But, we all uncovered secrets with Fireheart.The saddest part? At the end. Poor Graystripe and Fireheart.My favorite part? When Fireheart is finally talking to Bluestar.This book rules and I totally recommend it to all ages."
4,warriors a great book,"If the clan was attacked what would you do? When the ThunderClan is invaded by rouge cats Fireheart is fighting with his life to protect the leader,Bluestar from...tigerclaw?Why would he try to kill his own leader. Can he do it or will he be stopped find out when you read Warriors Forest of Secrets."
5,WOW,"Another great book by Erin Hunter.This book combines action, mystery, and romance to create one of the BEST BOOKS EVER! All the books in the WARRIORS series are amazing, so READ THEM! Woohoo! (Go Sandstorm!)"
5,Loved it,I love this book. Anyone could read this book. Its so good. There's nothing bad about it. Everything's good.love it
5,The ONLY ONE THAT's GOOD!!!,"If you love book 1 you hate it when you read book 2 and hate that when you read book 3. I am so, so, so, so, so glad that Fireheart finally beats Tigerclaw. The other great part is that Fireheart gets to be deputy of Thunderclan!!!!! The main sad part is that Graystripe leaves the clan. Also, read book 1 first. You get to understand more things then. That's all the main things that are in the story."
5,Warriors,Is the best book I cry for foreheads pain and suffering.skunk 's nd k banks Jana Jana Janis Janis ish hahaha jabs
2,Not for sensitive people!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I read the first and second books. They were great and left me dying for the next one. When my mom got it, I was so excited! Well, I should have read reviews on the third book, because it was a tear jerker. (I'm very sensitive) I got to the part where Graystripe's mate died. I didn't think the book would be so descriptive when it came to the whole ""a beloved character is dying"" thing, but I was wrong. This book can be VERY descriptive, and I really would not suggest that any kid under the age of twelve read this book unless they are sure they can handle a book much like Redwall......"
3,Playful Introduction to Zen,"I picked up this book a little skeptical. Hardcore Zen? Punk? What?? Then i started reading it and was like ugh, he's gonna preach about his life. Then i kept on reading and as pleasantly surprised. I enjoyed how this book is down to Earth. It's not over the top Buddhism, i feel it relates to average people. I feel he gave me a good idea of the importance of ""living in the now"" and enjoying empty space. Overall, it's written in a way to relate and make readers understand. However, sometimes it seemed he gets TOO much into his own life and off the track off zen. I was also surprised to see he was a monk and with hair! As far as people say ""he shouldn't be bashing others"" i pretty much disagree because let's face it. Some things other people do SUCK. haha, we should all be able to express that view and why it sucks. but yes definitely worth the read."
2,Not for me,"I think the author was genuinely trying not to be irritating, obscure and pretentious, but for this reader, he didn't succeed."
1,Strange viepoint,"Really off the beaten track, I only read a small portion of the book. It seemed like a distored viewpoint to me."
3,do not read as your first zen book. or your second.,"the book is a bit disjointed, and the marriage of life story and exposition on zen is rough. throughout the book the author guides the reader through his version of zen, speaking against drugs and for other things, which makes me think he doesn't completely get it. all of these things are zen. there is no distinction. but is book is heavy with his opinion, and he doesn't do enough to distinguish this from the truth."
5,"Buddhism, Schmuddism!","This is not like any book I have ever read on Buddhism or music! It is funny, candid, believable and helpful. There is no flowery feel-good stuff in here, but you will read it and you will feel good."
5,Nice take from a different perspective.,"I enjoyed reading this book from a non traditional point of veiw, so much of what was said is true, hardcore and right on."
5,A great place to start.,"If your new to Buddhism or just curious this is a great place to start. He writes in a way that is conversational and easy relate to. Instead of reading like a textbook or deep philosophical tome it's more like talking to someone you know - a real person. He also relates the basic teachings with his own life which makes it a lot less abstract. Even though his life experiences are different than mine, I still found a lot of similarities and useful insights."
2,BEWARE THOSE WHO REVEAL THE TRUTH ABOUT REALITY,"This arrogant author questioned his credentials as a Zen Master writing this book. Good question. I wondered how he could report Zenhood while claiming he could explain the sound of one hand clapping in the reality of hardcore punk, monster movies, and the synthetic embellishments of the virtual world we often live in. It is my problem that I distrust the fantasy makers, like David Stoctman who congered up Reagan's Supply Side Economics, or pudits who espose knowledge of TRUTH. The very claim arouses empirical disbelief; on one hand, while promising something emotionally higher.Compared to D. T. Suzuki or even Alan Watts, who delivered experience through literature, or Richard Gregg, who wrote ""The Power of Nonviolence"" who influenced Martin Luther King, this Zen is banal.I bought the book because I have created a garden I experience of as ""Nearly Zen."""
5,"Direct, funny, profane, challenging and a bit irreverent","I thoroughly enjoyed Warner's writing style - direct, funny, profane, challenging and a bit irreverent. I think his books will appeal to a whole generation of younger people who don't want to read the stuffy, esoteric Buddhist books."
1,I cannot stand this book.,"I'm on page 85 right now, and it's been a challenge just to get that far. There's nothing difficult about the text; however, I cannot stand the content. This book may be fine for someone else, but Brad Warner's personality irks me and makes it very hard to get through. I'd love nothing more than to throw this book in the trash, but I just cannot start a book and not finish it."
3,"Interesting, but","The author had several excellent points. And relating his life in Zen to punk rock and monster movies was a good read. However, the one thing that he did really did wrong was to call some people with opposing beliefs ""stupid."" He did this on several occasions in the text. That goes against Buddhism to the core. Buddhism is compatible with all other religions and can be used in conjunction with other religious practices. To call someone ""stupid"" because of the way they do or don't believe in reincarnation is unacceptable. He needs to meditate a little more on that topic and maybe do a rewrite."
2,"While Mr. Warner has insight, his personal lack of emotional maturity is distracting","Brad Warner SHOULD be compelling for me. I loved the punk movement and was deeply in the entire hardcore scene in my twenties. I found the Dharma at 33, so I was a late bloomer compared to Warner. I should be all over this guy's teaching! But, I just couldn't get over Warner's ego and immaturity. He has clearly seen the absolute, but he clearly has done ZERO work on seeing himself. Come down off the mountain dude. You aren't in the marketplace; you have a couple of steps to go on the ox-herders path. I'm not a zen teacher so what do I know, but I wonder what enlightenment is worth if Warner still seems angry and bent on alienating people."
3,Good introduction to zen,"I really enjoyed this book. Brad does a great job at explaining Zen and the practice of Zazen. Also, I liked the author's sense of humor. :)I really like that Brad stresses to question authority including one's own ideas.Another thing that I liked that Brad talked about was recognizing that we all have a dark side and that we can learn self control and do what is right.However, the only thing I really disagreed with him on is that snagging a nap is a time waster when one could be practicing meditation. Personally I think if more people took more naps the world would be a much better place. I think taking a nap is more constructive then meditation any day. Actually this has got me thinking maybe I'll start my own ""religion"" where naps are a commandment! LOL! :)"
4,a fantastic story,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this book because I have the stereotype bias that it may not be good because it is self-published. I was proven wrong. It is incredibly intriguing and I enjoyed every page of it! I also expected the main character to be a ""hero"" type. But all the characters are real, flawed and interesting. It makes me think of a mix of a Stephen King psychological thriller and E.R. (only with accurate medical scenarios). I am recommending this book to all my friends, I enjoyed it so much! This book has outshined many of the ""bestsellers"" I've read recently by large publishing houses."
4,All in good fun,"Sometimes you might get the urge to blow up huge space battleships flying around as a little fighter pilot like in the Star Wars movies. This game maybe a little bit dated by now, but I still enjoy watching the pixelated fireworks. In the game there are ultimately two sides you can choose from. Depending on which side you choose offers different sorts of missions as well as alternate endings to the story. Play and enjoy! Oh and by the way...the main character doesn't like cheaters much."
4,Great,In the realm of Wing Commander comes Tachyon. A very good space simulation that has very difficult missions sometimes. The storyline is great because you can control the outcome of the game. The graphics are very good although could have been a little better. Bruce Campbell voices pilot Jake Logan. A very fun game.
4,Great graphics! Great game!,"I got this game some time ago as a gift and even though I was never a fan of this type of game - I loved it. The graphics are great, gameplay is challenging but not impossible and there are several tutorials that take you through the basics of the game. Another big plus is the game doesn't take itself too seriously. Using Bruce Campbell for voiceovers was a brilliant idea and brought a spark of life (and humor) to the game.They also created a backstory for the game - a consistant well thought out one. It's nice to be able to choose your missions and who you want to fight for. One of my biggest beef with these types of games is the lack of choices, you just jump through the hoops. There's still a little of that in this game but not enough to detract from the positives."
2,Bite Off!,"Sure the graphics on this game might be nice, and have creative ships and characters, but in the long run this game is just a big bite off of Mechwarrior: Mercenary. For example, the Main Menu looked all too familiar. I thought I was playing Mechwarrior. Again, the plot is relatively similar. In my opinion, just a little close to Mechwarrior, and it's not what I would spend my money on."
3,i give a low rating because i don't liek Simulators much.,"well first off, i am not a big fan of simulators, infact i hate them all, except for this one, its got awseome graphics and is very fun, but difficult at times."
1,My review of this software,"I think that it stinks. I have contacted support three times and they never get back to you. Also, the software keeps crashing and locking up my computer. In my opinion it is a waste of time to buy this trash. It doesn't even deserve any stars. Don't buy it you will be disappointed. A DISSATISFIED CUSTOMER...."
2,Beware of defective sets,"I got this set and started to listen to it. I liked the music on it, but thought it was strange when I got to the 3rd disk and it said ""6"" on it. There are 2 disk 6s and no disk 3. I arranged to return it to the seller and they accepted the return, saying they have had a problem with a lot of these. Either a lot of them have no disk 3 and two disk 6s or else a lot of them have other disks mixed up.I'm going to try the Naxos Jando collection, which I've heard some parts of on the Naxos Web site. (Naxos points you back to Amazon to buy their CDs.)Fine musically, but bad mechanically."
1,the greatest penny a note composer,"I have listened to all 62 sonatas for keyboard and perhaps 3 of them rise to the level of wonderful composition. If you listen to them you hear he doesn't really ""get started "" until about sonata 32, compared with say Beethoven who except for 3 or 4 composed 32 of the greatest piano sonatas the world will ever hear. I have attempted to give Haydn a fair hearing for symphonic ( boring ) and keyboard works but for the most part he must get the award for not really being able to put 2 consecutive asthetic notes together. The Nelson Mass is very nice. And I know in his last years, Europe just adored him. He was earning upward in todays dollars of $85,000, which just galled Mozart.Finally the sonatas are performed and recorded well.Before purchasing these sonatas listen to the clips and see if you dont want to run screaming into the night, but if you are a boring person with absolutely no musical asthetic, these sonatas cant be beat!"
1,Utter Garbage,"Awfully written. Every five minutes of reading someone gorges themselves on sugars and other carby junk food and yet everyone is slender and healthy. The author must've been on some starvation diet while writing. Annoying. Weak plot line,dumb dialogue, unlikeable characters. I wish I could've given it negative rating. I was hoping for a light summer read, but this is just disappointing. Nuff said."
5,SANDRA BROWN DOES IT AGAIN!,"As usual, Sandra Brown succeeds! I could not put the book down after the 19th chapter. No way could anything interrupt me from finishing the book. Now that I'm done, I am glad to say that Sandra Brown once again fooled me with her multiple storylines. Great job, Sandra! I also recommend THE SWITCH. My all time favorite book by S. Brown. Get The CRUSH, you won't regret it!"
4,Suspense to the nth degree,I bought this book at the airport when my flight was delayed. It was my 4th Sandra Brown book so I new I was in for a treat. I finished it in 4 days because you never find a good stopping point for a Sandra Brown book. I thought the storyline was great and very suspenseful but the romance started too late in the book.
1,Free Lunch: How the Wealthiest Americans Enrich Themselves at Government Expense (and StickYou with the Bill) [Abridged] [Audiob,"More whining from the Liberal Chattering Class. I get it! Bush bad! Capitalism bad! Channey, EVIL! For a few chapters I had to fast forward thru to avoid throwing this heavy on accusation, light on analytic thought, CD in the trash. A perfect fit for those that think that there is always a wealthy person somewhere in the country planning to steal from the poor, honest, workingman.Great read for Trotskyites, Limousine Liberals, the Black Helicopter crowd, and most of today's Democrat Party."
1,Zzzzzzz....,"Oh. *blink, blink* is the book over?Sandra disappointed me with this one. Slow, boring, predictable. I love Sandra, but couldn't get into this one at all."
1,"A tired plot, a thoroughly unlikable heroine","Sandra Brown is a favorite author--I always buy her books as soon as they are released. I wish I had waited on this one. The plot is old and tired (A criminal fixates on a juror at his trial--haven't they made a movie or two with this plot line?), the heroine is unlikable and unbelievable and I am sick to death of maverick cops. Can someone write a book where the hero isn't a tortured loner? Ms. Brown is far more talented than this book. Take a pass, borrow it from a friend or the library if you must, but save your money for her next book. I'm sure it will be better."
2,Not the best,I usually love Sandra Brown books but this one took me forever to get though. I didn't really care one way or the ohter about any of the characters. A very average book.
3,Most implausible but quite entertaining,"Story credibility 0 stars (out of 5)Story plausibility 0 starsHumorous situations 3 starsKept me entertained 4 starsA cop killer on the loose who does anything he wants and the police can never nail him. A former whorish teenage who is now the mother of virtue. An ex-cop who obsesses with her even after learning her extremely lurid past. A long and silly story that with some intelligent editing could have been terrific and much more credible.I don't understand how a famous writer could come up with such a contrived and flimsy plot. But even so, this spicy romance story disguised as a cop novel kept me entertained all the way, even though I could never set aside my disbelief to get really engrossed. I am definitely going to buy more of her books hoping that this was not one of her best."
3,Not up to her recent standards,"I am a big fan of Sandra Brown's romantic suspense writing. I purchased 'The Crush' as soon as it was available and read it immediately. Sure I had high expectations, but even considering that fact, this book is not up to Brown's recent standards. 'Envy', 'The Switch','Exclusive','The Witness','French Silk' and 'The Alibi' are well written and have much more carefully crafted plots. Try those if you want a good story. This story was reminiscent of Brown's earlier writing, using the story just to get to the romantic conclusion."
4,Audio book review,"This is not as spellbinding as some of Sandra's earlier romantic-suspense novels and I was tempted to rate it 3 stars. However, I must say I thoroughly enjoyed Tom Wopat's reading skills as I listened to this on audio CD. He has good voice inflections and made a mediocre story come to life. On a long car trip, it sure beat listening to radio stations with poor reception.Rennie Newton was a hard person to get to know and like. She was so controlled and emotionally suppressed that her true character did not show until the end. Wick Threadgill was a cowboy - likable, goodlooking, but a real loose cannon. There was good chemistry between the two, but at times it was a bit forced.The story was interesting enough, but not up to her previous standards."
4,Good one but read better by Author,"I have been an avid fan of Sandra Browns since September. Meanwhile, I have read all I could get my hands on. This book is very good but I recommend Mirror Image, Exclusive and Breath of Scandal as my favorites by this author. Read it and enjoy!"
2,2.4,"This was my first Sandra Brown book....and my last! Enough said!However, as Amazon requires me to express at least 20 words, let me add that this was an extremely predictable and cliched book. Creepy hired gun, heroine with a mysterious sordid past and a maverick cop. Put them together in a large metropolis (this time, Fort Worth)and weave a thin thread to come up with this weak, unbelievable story.Yes, I did finish it, but in no way was I reading a novel story. It has all been said before in movie and book form."
2,Dumb and dumber,"Contract killer Ricky Lozada, who'd been on trial for murder, develops a fixation on Rennie Newton, the medical doctor who served as jury forewoman and got him off. He starts stalking her. Enter Wick Threadgill, the troubled, brooding, mentally unstable police officer (are there any other kind?), who hopes to protect her -- and score with her, and not necessarily in that order. The relationship between the cracked-up cop and the troubled trauma surgeon, never too realistic to start off with, just gets stupider and stupider as the book goes on. SPOILER ALERT. When you get to ""the evil man just killed my beloved horses so why don't I make love for the first time in twenty years,"" you've touched bottom in dumb-ness. I just hope my I.Q. can eventually recover from having read the book."
3,Not one of her best,I waited on this book to come out and rushed to the book store when it did . Boy was I in for a let down . I buy S.B. books for the mix of steamy romance and suspense.This book had lots of suspense very little romance.I would not recommend The Crush if your looking for normal Sanda Brown romance.
3,"Really hard to get into, but once it gets going, it's pretty good.","My title pretty much says it all. It's very slow to start, but once the plot opens up, it gets really good."
2,nowhere near Brown's previous works,"I have enjoyed most of Sandra Brown's previous books - The Switch, Envy, and even her older titles. So I was not only disappointed but surprised with The Crush. It was painfully slow and Brown dragged out the suspense to the point where it simply got tiresome to turn the page. I finally abandoned efforts to finish it when I could not get the image of Wick - the most unappealing hero in a romance! Sorry but I don't find anything romantic about a man who doesn't like to read and so burdened by his problems he doesn't care about personal hygiene and the state of his living conditions. I hope Brown's next book won't feature another [character]."
5,I loved this!!!,"I thought that there could not have been a better narrator for this book.. I loved the story, plenty of suspense, plenty of humor and just a great story plot. I caught myself laughing a couple of times while listening to this. Although, I was suspicious about whether or not she really actually shot Ray Collier, to finally get to the story behind it, I really felt for Remi. She was to sensitive to be able to actually murder someone, her life is helping people not hurting them, I loved to hate ""Ricky Roy"" because he was just a great villain."
5,Love it!,"I loved this book so much that i had to go buy the hardcover so i could have it forever.This book is amazing and has the best element of mystery,romance and everything.I recommend this book to anyone interested in mystery or romance or just anyone who wants a good read that will keep you up late and hooked.Happy reading."
3,"Good start, unbelievable love making, bad ending","I must say that the story did intrigue me and ignoring the bad words I could say I loved it, but when it got to the most important part, that is the ""sex scene"" I became disgusted.First of all the sex scenes are supposedly to be the most important part of a relationship with the two main characters since once it is done their attitude toward each other changes.Well I found this part of romance rather silly and umbelievable in this book, can a woman do it after being hard to get just because her horses were killed? Oh, please!For the entertainment and good laughs there 3 stars but for the romance in it, forget it Ms. Brown"
5,Page Turning Suspense !,"Oh, I loved this story. I thought it was one of the better Sandra Brown Stories. A real page turner! I started the book and couldn't put it down until after I finished the whole book, it was that compelling."
1,Do Not Buy,I'll make this short and sweet. I've gone through two of these (took one back) bought at Home Depot. The on/off valve is defective. Called the company and they stated they were aware of it and was working on it but had not fixed the problem as of yet and weren't sure when it would be fixed. After about a month a could hear water running although it should of been in the off position. Not reliable. I spent a little more money and bought a Liberty backup sump and that is worlds apart in quality.
4,Pretty good,"It took me about four or five tries to get the hang of the routine presented here, but once I learned it, it was no problem. The routine is led by one woman, and there are two non-speaking women in the background who follow her lead. At times, the cues the leader gives are a little off -- she says them slightly after the fact when it's too late to follow -- and her assistants, particularly the one on our right side, get confused. Which brings me to the subject of left and right-- I appreciate it when a video instructor means ""the VIEWER'S right (or left)"" and not HERS, so that we mirror-image each other. That doesn't happen here. But as I said, after a couple tries, these points became trivial. Slightly dated exercise costumes, but that doesn't matter either. All in all, if you are looking for a half hour of moderate aerobics, this could be for you. I play mine about once a week."
1,Programming garbage; error ridden book,"This is an absolutely horrible, error ridden book. My college uses this book, with the knowledge how bad it is. The woman can't even get a logical true and false table correct! She does not even use the standard programing format in Javascript. If you want such garbage go ahead and buy it! There are other books that are more informative and without such numerous errors in the text."
5,Speedstar Loop,I bought this piece thinking it connected to the Speedstar Raceway .. if I does ... I can't figure out how. It is still very cool. Comes with it's own car and crank ... spins around the loop. Only Flaw .. without connecting it to something (maybe there are additional speedstar racetracks) it just zooms across the room. You have to go chase after the car.
2,Disappointment,"The toy is quite easy to put together and is durable, but the best thing about it is the car. My 3 year old got this for Christmas and plays with the car but not the track. The car never makes it through the loop. It could have been a winner, but was quite disappointing."
2,It's OK,"I agree with the other review that this is very flexible plastic and not as sturdy as expected. I also found that it needed to be a little bit longer. Because they aren't very long, we have a problem latching it on our rounded cabinet hardware. I wouldn't recommend this product. It does the job though, just not sufficiently."
3,Doesn't stay latched,"While we still use this ""lock"", I wouldn't use it to keep your baby or toddler away from anything harmful. We first used it to keep our 10 month old out from under the kitchen sink, but after a few attempts he was able to unlatch it quite easily. We are now using it to keep him out of our food cupboard. We moved the chemicals out of reach."
3,Get several Back- ups.,"This product works very well for keeping younger toddlers out, however, older kids and husbands seem to forget it is there and break it once a month. We have a side by side and the product was great and worked very well and served its purpose. Although it could be annoying and my husband hated it, the latch did keeps eggs, milk and anything else off my floors or under beds. Hope this helps!"
1,Useless,"This latch was completely useless on my cabinets. The handles went completely through, and the plastic itself is flimsy enough for a strong toddler to break it anyway (even if it fit). It's not worth returning it and paying for shipping, so I ended up throwing this out. Too bad - great idea, horrible execution."
2,Latch,Good in theory but these are not good for all knobs. They were too big for all but oversized knobs in one bathroom. Waste of money for us.
2,"Maybe, maybe not","The product looks and functions more or less as expected, well much more like less. Unfortunately, the plastic is weak and overly flexible, whereas it should be strong to resist bending it off. Also, the locking mechanism is too easy. The product doesn't work well on straight knobs that don't have anything to hang on to. I don't recommend this product for a cabinet you really want to keep secure. If a child is incapable of removing this then it also means s/he can't open a door either, because it is so easy to remove, so don't get it.After using this product for over a year as an infant has grown into a toddler, my opinion of it has gone down further. The plastic is so flexible that it is very easy for a child to take it off. If anything, this product is more of a toy than a barrier. I have tried it with several kinds of drawer knobs and it doesn't work with any of them."
4,Keeps baby OUT!,"Fantastic at keeping the baby out of his ""favorite"" cabinets and is easy for the adults in the house to use. Great product."
4,"A little flimsy, but works","These aren't very rigid and seem like they could break easily, but they have kept our 1 year old son out of the cabinets so far. Easy for the adults to get in and out of the cabinets without too much hassle."
2,Cheap feel and doesn't work with knobs,"These are basically a waste of money, the plastic and locking mechanism is very cheap. Unfortunately, it is bulky enough where it basically will not work with any knobs, only enclosed handles. Basically most knobs are tapered and it is so thick that it can only be closed to the thicker part of the knob, where it can be slid off easily. I tried the KrisCords which actually work as it is a cord so it can be tightened around the middle thin part of a knob."
3,Good for the price,"These work well (my 22 month old son has yet to open them), but I did drop a couple on a hard surface (kitchen tile), and they did break due to how brittle they are. But then again these are priced relatively inexpensive.I like how they fit handles that are far apart or handles that are close (where some latches can't accommodate).Although some have broken due to my dropping them, I have purchased some more given the low cost of replacement.Notwithstanding how brittle they are, given the price I would recommend."
2,Ugh...,"While this isn't the worst romance I've ever read (that would be Charlotte Lamb's The Marriage War), it isn't nearly the caliber of book that I have come to expect from Penny Jordan. Adam is an unpleasant, arrogant man who sleeps around, and Brooke is the beautiful, kind heiress who seems to fall in love with him despite there being no indication of anything being in him that is worth loving. I wouldn't recommend this at all. Try some of Penny's other novels, like The Ultimate Surrender or A Savage Adoration - in these you will find men of values who are worth the heroine's time."
2,From the back cover,"Love has no price.Brooke Beauclere was under no illusions. To Adam Henderson she was an object of fleeting desire - upper class, stunningly beautiful, elusively tantalizing - a suitable conquest for an over-confident male with a fortune at his disposal.Oh, how she longed to teach him a lesson for his arrogant assumption that she could be purchased - at any price! Why, he was no more feeling than the high-society snobs who'd once humiliated him for his working-class roots.Against all reason, Brooke was attracted to him and running from the time when she might reveal her love and risk losing Adam completely."
1,Horrible product.... Horrible customer service from the seller,Horrible product...delivered broken.... tried contacting seller but he did not respond.Amazon has not done ANYTHING about it.I have never been cheated like this earlier.Do not waste your money buying product from this seller....my sincere suggestion
3,Higher System,"I received this game very fast. However, when I went to install the game, it would not run on my system. The installation setup screen informs me there is a part missing. I was very disappointed and have not been able to get it working."
3,"Great writing, literary quality---but for the most part not Sci Fi","There are some good SF stories here. ""Merchants Of Venus"" being the best. But---and it's a big one---if you're hoping to find some exciting science fiction here you may be disappointed.""Greensleaves"" is a story about prison life.""The Kindly Isle"" is about a widower meeting a new friend.Anything science fiction like in these stories are incidental and might easily have been tacked on rather than being integral to the stories.Even the science fictiony stories---those about space travel and aliens---are really very tame and mundane in the telling.""The Middle of Nowhere"" is an example. Though it's subject is hostile aliens, life and death struggle and the hostile Mars environment, there is very little real conflict in it.Pohl may be a giant, but he's not for this reader."
5,This book is the coolest!,"When Sandys and Dennys are transported back into Noah's time, they are encounteredwith danger, excitement, love, confusion, andsadness. It is humorous, even though when theyhave to say good-by, it is so sad. This bookis so great! I loved it and I'm sure you will,too"
2,not a good children's novel,I read the first three books in this quartet and I really liked them so I decided to read many waters. I was in grade 5 at the time and unlike the other three books it had a mature theme to it it really grossed me out when I was in grade 5. I don't think this book should be considered a childrens novel and it doesn't belong with the other books in the quartet.
5,A Great Novel,"The Murry twins, Sandy and Dennys,were just trying to get some food when they are blasted into a time of many waters,the time of Noah and the ark...In this book a serphin once said ""Many waters can not quench love nor can floods drown it."" Sandys and Dennysmust hope this pretains to them and their love Yalith also because when the rains comes and their not on the ark they can only hope..."
1,"Ha ha ha funny, this book sucks!",Were do i start. We had to read this for school and th 8th grade and My parents read it to me sometimes when we had reading time. Sometimes my mom put the boo down and was horrified with the amount of sexual relationships. The two twins in loin cloths getting in the nude and coming close to actually going to home base. The story concept was slow and horrifying. Do not recommend this book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Fantastical,"When I started reading Many Waters I was in awe! The different characters and the settings jumped out at you, and I liked that. The characters seemed to interest me as well. The fact that the boys were able to help people so much and catch the errors of the families was amazing!That is why I have the book 5 stars."
4,L'Engle's best book to date.,"The way this book combines so many adult things (morals, religion, science fiction, and fantasy) into a children's book is truly magnificent. As a seventeen-year-old reader, I can definitely say that this book is not just for children. It's a triumphant and intellectual journey into adulthood, and very clever at being so. I especially love the personalities given to Sandy and Dennys, who previously in the series weren't given very much thought. This novel stands on its own from the rest of the series with the integrated aspects of religion and adventure... it's definitely the least sci-fi. The other books are not required reading beforehand, and I dearly love this novel."
3,"Very, very good.but not for young readers","I agree with the other reviewers, that it isn't for young readers. It is for teenagers--this book should be checked by an adult before giving permission to read. I actually give it three 'n' a half stars, though, because it is very good. It is an amazing Bible story turned into something rich and deep. Although I think L'Engle was a little too heavy on the religious factor, it is a very good book and you are drawn into it right away. It is placed before the flood, and just like in the Bible, people were ""eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage"" until the day of the flood. But can Sandy and Dennys get back to their own time?"
3,Well-thought-out and knowledgeable,"Many Waters by Madeline L'engle was very well-thought-out and scientific. It was wonderfully clever, and held a very unique point of view on time and religion. The story gave an excellent picture of how the main characters, Sandy and Denis, tried to find their way home from a strange desert world before it is flooded.I enjoyed Many Waters very much. The only problem was how slow it moved. The book took so much time describing some parts that it missed describing other parts. This made it seem like a failed attempt to make something exciting. Otherwise, Many Waters was a very interesting book to read. I recommend it to people that like slow, well-described, and knowledgeable sounding stories."
4,about two twins that get sent back to the story of Noah'sark,This book to me is very good but it is not the best book I have ever read. Though it has a good story many characters and interesting. It's not too hard to follow. I liked this book very much and I plan to read the whole series. The reason I want to do this is because of the plot of this book I hope the others are as good as this one. The best thing about this book is it bounces around from one character to another and dosn't stay with one person the whole story. This book was a little bit too long and drawn out even though it was good there was a little bit too much detail. I recomend this great book to everyone.
2,Don't Judge a Book by it's Cover.,"I read Many Waters because I had read the books before it and loved it. When I was in a bookstore I thought oh... that cover looks intersesting so I picked it up and bought it. I brought it home and after the first three chapters I couldn't read anymore. The book was dull and slow moving. I forced myself to read more thinking that it would get better. Maybe it got a little better, but not much. Some people loved this book, but I think that it was really dull."
4,A Good Book,"If You've read Wrinkle in Time & the others...don't expect this to be the same type of book...although I certainly enjoyed it, It's not as magical or amazing, its more of an everyday story unlike the others...but read it anyway...its very good."
3,ideal for the religous type,"Madeleine L'Engle combines unicorns, a desert, and Noah's Ark into one book. Keeps you on the edge and hard to put down at times."
3,Not for the younger reader!,"My eleven year old daughter and I have enjoyed reading the Wrinkle in Time books together as ""out loud"" bedtime and long car trip reading. The story lines and display of imagination have been wonderful. I am by no means conservative or narrow minded in my critique of children's books, but I felt blind sided by the blatant sexual conversation in Many Waters and really don't understand the gratuitous insertion so different from anything in the other three books in the time travel series. My daughter actually said ""I don't think this is a children's book..."" after reading the explicit language which would be more appropriate for my two high school students. This left me disappointed and disturbed by a book that was otherwise very entertaining."
3,Many Waters Cannot Quench Love,"When Sandy & Dennys Murry mess up their father's experence with virtual particles, it's their turn for the adventure. They go back in the days of Noah, before a terrible flood that only Noah & his wife, Matred, his sons, Shem, Ham, & Jashep, & their wives can live through. Before that, however, 'The Sand' & 'The Den' must bring Noah & his father together, build up the ark, get thrown between the fuide between the good sephim and the evil nephilim, and learn to love before they leave."
4,Reacquaintance,"I have known this book fairly well since I first discovered it in the library. That was how I'd adventured through all the Quintet books too. After so many years, I jumped at the chance to own at least two of her books on my Kindle. I'm 60% of hte way to owning the whole series, since I have A Swiftly Tilting Planet on paperback. I'm glad to own some of the books thhat have walked me through adolesence. Madeleine L'Engle's words became my friends as Meg and Charles Wallace sojourned through worlds and their lives and Sandy and Dennys went back in time. It's been fun, for keeps."
3,Pleasant tangent,"It's been a long time since I read the first three books in this series, so I have relatively vague memories of the various kids. Still, I recalled enough to know that this is the first time the twins Sandy and Denny get to enjoy the spotlight. In this story, the twins are sent back in time to live with Noah and his relatives, pre-ark. It's a pleasant read that nicely straddles both the line between child and adult, and between religious faith and scepticism. It is by nature a religious story, but not so much that it hits you over the head. The twins themselves seem unconvinced by the end of the book.All in all, a nice read that doesn't so much continue the Murry story's family, as send two of its characters on a tangential adventure."
5,Wonderful Book!,"This book is one of Madeline L'Engle's best! I loved it. Sandy and Dennys Murry are are identical twins. They have a younger brother Charles Wallace Murry and an older sister now in college Meg Murry. Their mother is a scientist and their father experiments with space and time travel. The twins walk into their mother's lab not noticing a sign sayin ""EXPERIMENT IN PROGRESS. PLEASE KEEP OUT."" Dennys types into a computer in the lab: TAKE ME SOMEPLACE WARM and the twins end up back in the time of Noah. Anyone who liked A Wrinkle in Time should read this book! It is one of my favorite books by Madeline L'Engle!"
5,One of the best ever!,"I've read A Wrinkle In Time and I liked the book. When I looked for the other companions of Wrinkle in Time, I accidentaly got Many Waters. I started reading it and to my surprise, I could'nt let go of the book anymore. The story can actually work in you. The book is very easy to absorb and I was impressed with the characters. If you were to ask me what Madeleine L'Engle book to read, I would say ""Many Waters"" right away. I love the book and I know that alot of people will love the book to."
3,An interesting read,"I really enjoyed this book, but it kind of drags on after awhile. The book is about twins Dennys and Sandy Murry who long to be in a warm, sparsely populated place in the middle of a cold winter. They are transported to biblical times, right before Noah begins building his ark. They meet several characters from the Bible, including Noah himself, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, and a few miniature mammoths as well. They also encounter strange creatures called the Seraphin and Nephalim, who are not human but huge beings with wings. And they meet a girl, Yalith, whom they fall in love with. Then they realize that there is going to be a flood after ""El"" tells Noah to build an ark, and Yalith will not be saved. They struggle to survive and wonder how they will leave this place. This book is good, although it has some sensual content in it, and I found the last seventy or so pages slightly boring. However, overall I really liked this book and how it focused on the lives of all the characters."
2,"Exciting, but...er...mature matter","This book is not the genteel book that L'Engle readers are used to...it contains some mature matter. Nothing bizzare or vulgar, but not for young children, more for teens. It is very exciting. That's all I will say, except that the adult's form didn't work. I'm 15."
4,Cool book,"I must be honest - I actually liked this book better than 'A Wrinkle In Time'. Sandy and Dennis - Meg's younger twin brothers - find themselves whisked back into an ancient world that is pre-Biblical flood. Noah is one of the supporting characters in this book, and you also have the Seraphim, some of who mate with human women to create the giants mentioned in the Bible. This is a really cool and unique take on the Biblical story of the Flood and I found myself enjoying it a LOT. If you didn't like 'A Wrinkle in Time', you might enjoy this book, because it's different."
4,One of the best books I have read,"March 24, 2011In the time quortet by Madeleine LEngle I think this was the best. The Biblical characters were pretty accurate. It is now one of MY top 10 books. As you probably know many books are written, but I think Many Waters will stay as one of my top 10. Most of the time authors dont write a ""prequal"". This is my first experience of reading one. The way Many Waters explains love is very detailed. If you love books with romance and adventure then I think you will enjoy this book as much as I have. Caution: Imagination is necessary to fully comprehend the book.April 10, 2011I have finished reading Many Waters for the second time and again I have enjoyed the book. I understood the book a little better this time. It is one of those books that you have to read two or more times to understand the book. I think I might read it again but I am not sure when."
2,Halfway Satisfied,"I was not entirely impressed by this particular novel. The idea of mixing two genres (romance and mystery) in the same book is always intriguing. I did enjoy the romance side of this novel but the mystery side left little to be desired by me. I feel that the mystery plot was not clearly defined and I did, at times, lose my train of thought. On the romance side, however, I feel that the characters lives were very real. I definitely could relate to what was happening between Tangy and Eric. I feel that the author will improve her technique as time passes. Since this is her debut novel, I will give her books another chance to impress me. As with many things, it just gets better with time."
2,Review for Lexmark Product - Toner,"Unfortunately this product, Lexmark E120 Toner Cartridge did not fulfill expectations. Though a USED product and advertised as such, this cartridge appeared more as finished or little toner left. Now, I have to spend more money and buy another cartridge seeing that if I print more that 3 copies, nothing will appear on the pages. Super dissatisfied. Best, M.Crespo"
3,O_O,Why is it going for $95? Is it out of print or something? I got it for list price just last year!
2,Disappointing,"I was disappointed in this book. It was poorly written and probably not edited at all. This would probably be OK if the information was more concise. There were a few tips an artist such as myself could use, but by and large, I could find the same info. in other resources. The computer advice was dated and, though it works for the author, would be unworkable for me. I do not recommend this book."
2,This shouldn't be considered a game,"I had high expectations when I bought this game. However, I was extremely disappointed to find out that it's hardly a game at all. Minimal skill and effort is required to get from scene to scene. I can only assume that all the good reviews for this game are from the people who had an obsession with the movie and are just excited to now own the computer-game version. I wish I'd never spent my money on this, it is the single worst computer game purchase I have ever made."
3,Blade Runner,"Blade Runner directed by Ridley Scott was a strange sci-fi movie. I thought that it is funny how people in the 80's have viewed the Los Angeles in 2019. We know that nothing like that is going to happen. Genetically engineered superhumans used for slavery in not likely to happen in the near future. I thought is was also funny how Harrison Ford was supposed to discard of the Androids but instead he falls in love with one of them. I never did understand why she did not die when the others did. They are only supposed to live life half of what we do. This movie also makes you think. Like at the end when he was talking about the android that saved him. He said that they were searching for the same answers that we are. Like why are we here, what is our purpose, ect. Doesn't that make you wonder. And another thing that puzzles me about the movie is, why did the android save his life?"
3,Disappointing -,"I was really thrilled by Olga Borodina when I heard her in the concert hall (as Marfa in Khovanschina, then as Amneris in Aida) and her contributions to a lot of the recording of Russian operas with the Mariinski under Ghergiev, or to Haitink's Don Carlo have justly been encensed by many. I therefore bought this CD, Borodina's first opera arias ""collection"", without a second of hesitation... and I have to say I am quite disappointed. Of course, the voice is here : large, sumptuous, sensual, but there is not much characterisation and involvement. Could this be due to the lack of stage experience in the many roles she approaches in this recital ? I am still happy to own it for her glorious Dalila in the 3 excepts of ""Samson..."" and for the 2 Tchaikovski numbers, but I tend to skip the other tracks... and am waiting for another aria collection CD that would do better justice to this wonderful singer."
2,Mediocre little stories,"Set in the same universe as Bubblegum Crisis and AD Police, Parasite Dolls tells the story of police investigating crimes involving 'Boomers' human-like replicas.But the animation is fairly cheap with a lot of still images and not much motion, the designs are not very innovative and the stories are rather dull. It honestly does not live up to the old Bubblegum Crisis or AD Police animes.I'd recommend you check those out and skip this one."
3,You need another $20 already?!?,"The animation focuses mostly on detailed facial expressions which is cool and different. There is a lot of back-story, however, which leads to a lot of conversational scenes where action is limited.Also, as my title reflects, there are only three eps on the disc. I've been bummed before when getting four eps instead of five on discs and held my tongue. Three is just not enough. Either give some REALLY sweet extras or put more eps on the disc or lower the price.Finally, ep3 has one of,if not THE, most grotesque scene I've ever witnessed in anime or any other media. (read S&M; snuff-scene). To each his own, and I'm no prude, but this one was out there.What the heck, though...it's only a cartoon , right?...and she was just a Boomer after all, right?"
1,One good concept and a lot of BLA BLA,"Reader be advised that the author owns a consulting firm that applies Woody's proprietary model in making market forecasts and, needless to say, he's not giving out anything ...Interestingly enough, the author criticizes the use of quantitative models, but later attempts to measure the ""mood"" of the market to use it in a quantitative model ... ? One more comment: the average reader of business publications expects to find some logic in the style; this is not fiction, and using a ""keep the reader guessing what the author REALLY means"" is no business reading.Did you take English 101 like the rest of us?"
1,Terrible Book,I used this lab manual in a college geology class. The book is terrible. The lab questions are absurd and rarely pertain to the reading. There is a page that is completly missing text. Two questions are supposed to refer to the text. I would not recomend this book to anyone. I would advise people against using it.
4,"Definitely whitens, but...","After two weeks my teeth are certainly whiter but don't seem to be whitening further in the process, and they're nowhere near ""celebrity white."" Nor do I want that artificial result. I use the gel for 30 minutes in the evening and follow with the enamelizer once or twice a week as directed. I drink coffee and brush after and don't smoke because I know those things can stain. All in all, an affordable product that does work but wish it provided better results."
4,"This was my first Space sim, and I wasn't disappointed","With the Mechwarrior games being my only Simulation experience, I bought this one mainly for the cool pictures on the box. For once, they did justice to the frosty disc within. Playing Lt. Casey, you fly missions against a strange invading foe, intent on extinguishing all life they find. Spanning three discs, I lost count of the missions I flew. I was so involved, I actually jumped when I was blown up! I've never played a game that left me shaking afterwards...this one grabs you by the neck, wrings you out, and leaves you exhausted but wanting more. Keeping it from 5 stars is a small glitch that makes the mouse pointer travel across the screen by itself, making menu items difficult to choose at times. A small flaw indeed, but an annoying one."
2,Not as good as X-Wing Allience not even close.,"Wing Commander prophecy was a good idea to a certain extent. It was an expansion on the Wing Commander series which is a fun video game to play but Wing Commander prophecy fell way short of what it could've been. The gameplay is blocky and hard to master and the video quality is average at best. Overall I would only give it four out of 10 it was not worth the money I spent on it. If you're looking for a space simulator your best bet is X wing, X wing alliance or tie fighter from LucasArts. These are much better space simulators than Wing Commander prophecy and worth your money. The only thing I would recommend is make sure that X wing X wing alliance and tie fighter will work on your machine. They are older programs so they may not work on the newer operating systems. But if they do I highly recommend them over Wing Commander prophecy. I hate to say it but this game was a huge disappointment. Have a nice dayAllen W Yoakum"
4,Underrated !,"This set has never been a critical favorite. I doubt anyone would claim that Ashkenazy is one of the great Beethoven interpreters. And yet it makes for quite pleasurable listening. For starters, we have Ashkenazy's high technical prowess, his beautiful tone and general finesse. We seem to have accepted as great Beethoven pianism, playing that ranges from the painfully plain (Brendel) to the downright ugly (Kuerti). But Kempff has shown us that a non-aggressive beauty can reveal another side of this great composer. Ashkenazy is not in Kempff's league as a Beethoven interpreter, but nearly every performance is effective here and evinces a real musical fluency. More ambitious Beethoven players (e.g. Kovacevich) have often made recordings that totally miss the mark.So, this set would be a perfect for listeners coming to this music for the first time. And seasoned Beethoven sonata listeners might enjoy it as well. Just don't expect poetical profundity."
2,An introductory set,"At first glance this set definetly catches the eye, but as soon as you start listening, one realizes that Ashkenazy doesn't live up to the Beethoven's challenge.Not only is the sound quality below high grade standards for Decca (ie: dim levels), his playing doesn't capture the spiritual, emotional, and dramatic elements of this music. The only thing he does well are the slow movements, which are gorgeous.However, after listening to so many exemplary Sonata sets like Artur Schnabel's, Annie Fischer's and Wilhelm Kempff's, I am left to wonder about Ashkenazy's. He seems to only concentrate on the quality and sound of the TONE...however beautiful it is. But to me, there is no profound emotion behind his playing. And for me this is the most important in Beethoven.For anyone serious about Beethoven, I can only recommend this set as an introductory set, for someone just getting into Beethoven's sonatas."
2,nice laptop........when it works,"When working, this is a sweet little laptop for the money. Mine will reboot itself on startup repeatedly until it warms up. 4, 5, 6 reboots before it will load windows. Sony support sent the laptop back unfixed. On hold now for 45min. Guess i'm the only one with a lemon though. Fast enough, small, cheap and nice looking. I agree, it has waaaaaay to much crap software. Linux works well, all hardware recognized."
1,Second Vaio Lemon,"I purchased this laptop in FEB 2007 because I thought my first Vaio was awesome. It died one week later just shy of being two years old. Now here I am nearly two years later and this model has stopped working as well. Considering the price one would expect it to last longer than two years or at least make it to the two year mark. There is a lawsuit against sony involving their laptops. Buyers be wary, and if you do buy make sure you buy the extended warranty with it as well. Taken Twice, Sony Loses customer!"
3,"Great laptop, questionable battery","I have had this laptop for one year and 3 months, and the battery is now dead after recommended usage. With such an expensive Sony battery, and a lot of problems with other brand batteries, it may be worthwhile in obtaining an extended warranty to cover a replacement battery."
2,Not the best,"I have had this lap top for a year now. The biggest problem I encountered was almost exactly a year after I got the laptop and the warentee expired. The battery just decided to die. Luckily after numerous calls to Sony they sent me a new battery, but it took three calls. I hope that a new battery isnt needed every year, because that would be just ridiculous. Also i use the laptop a lot, and the left clicker under the touch pad got scratched. The paint is coming off. It looks awful, but thats just a cosmetic problem. Other then those problems this laptop has done its job."
2,quality of product,"Hi, In general I'm happy with product. except several points1. HDD should be 120 GB i got only 100GB2. I should get CD/DVD with drivers for laptop, there were nothing in packagenext time I will think twice before ordering from this sellerbest,"
5,Great Value,"OK, this set comes with 3 cookie sheets of differing sizes, which are thick and non-stick, and all for under $15 with free shipping! You can't go wrong with that! I've used cookie sheets purchased at upscale cooking stores where one cookie sheet costs more than this whole set, and honestly, I can't see a difference in the results. Conversely, I have purchased similar sets at bargain stores for similar prices, and the quality has been lacking (non-stick coating scrapes away, sheets warp during baking, etc.) Though I haven't had this Baker's Secret set very long, so far its quality appears high. I would recommend it!"
4,Works good.,"Decent pans nothing fancy, wish they were a tad more heavy duty. But hey you get what you pay for."
5,My Daughter Loves It!,"I ordered this for my 3 1/2 year old daughter. She has been trying to write her name before, but some letters give her trouble. I gave her this ""book"" and she loves it! We own about 10 First Leap Pad books and she plays with this one more than any (she even put down the Disney Princess one to play with this). She likes practicing tracing the dotted lines on the letters. She doesn't do most of the other games, but she enjoys tracing the letters. The music makes it more exciting than the preschool handwriting books I had purchased for her. She won't spend two minutes with those. It does seem that her ""free"" handwriting is getting better. She just received the L-Max for Christmas (we haven't opened it yet)and the Letters on the Loose game which I read was good for writing. I'm sure that with both of these, she will have writing down pat very soon."
3,Lena Horne At the Waldorf Astoria CD,"I received the CD promptly but it wasn't exactly as I expected. I had hoped it would be more like 'torch' music instead of the jazzy, big-band sound. We sent the CD to my father-in-law and he is enjoying it. He's 79. Thanks"
4,Excellent softcase,"Not a hardshell, this softcase is more protective than a typical gigbag but lightweight. The foam will dent slightly under very hard finger pressure, but is an inch thick at the thinnest point so should be adequate. Ignore the picture, the case is rectangular, approximately 40""x15""x5"", and fits my strat-style perfectly. It has two interior spaces that can hold a pocket-size effects box, strings, straps, etc. The outside zipped pocket will accept a 9""x12"" songbook or a couple of pedals with some room to spare. The mesh outer pocket doesn't hold much but, oddly, does open at both ends. The zippers are plastic coil-type with no markings."
2,nice case too small for most guitars,"Bought this guitar for my sons new schecter, looks nice and sturdy and it is lightweight but does't fit the schecter or strat..make sure you measure before ordering. Also still trying to get answer from comapny on returning or exchange...not sure i would deal with this company again.."
3,Lego Racers,"Lego racers is a stunning game with moderately good graphics. It's fun to design and build your own car but it's hard to make exactly what you want. The game is challenging but not to hard to beat. There is a nice variety of tracks and there are recognizable lego characters. Also, it's fun to create your own wacky Lego characters, earning parts from winning race. The sound is nice and different characters say different fun things. I enjoyed this game, but it wasn't the best. Unless you really want to play Lego Racers, I suggest Nicktoons."
4,Lego Racers Is Great!,"Graphics:4 I think they did a good job making those Lego bricks look real.Sound:4.5 Good Music though some thimes it gets anoying.Controls:4 Kind of hard to control.Gameplay:5 The ""in car"" veiw looks like your in the Lego World.Power ups are goodLasting appeal:4.5 This game might take a long time to beat or it could take you 2 days(If you play all the time).Final score:4"
5,Not just for kids...,"I'm too old to be playing with Lego's, but I really enjoy this game. The premise is hilarious, and the ability to design your own car goes far beyond painting colors on a stock car. And, I can consistently win...everyone needs an ego boost now and then. The game play is not particularly fast, but the cars move at a controllable speed; slow enough to enjoy the scenery and fast enough to keep me entertained. The only downside is that the graphics aren't on par with other newer titles - their a little rough around the edges."
4,"Awesome, but tough on your computer","I have this game and it is really fun!!!! The only reason I left out one star is because, like all LEGO games, it is really hard on your computer. I also had two other lego games, and together the three totally crashed the computer. My parents won't let us install any games on the computer now. It's a shame, because I really miss playing LEGO Racers. It's not extremely challenging, not if you're played other racing games and are good at them. However, beating Rocket Racer is very (underline ten times) difficult. One of my favorite things to do is creating my own racers to race with. You can mix-match different legs, bodies, heads, and helmets or hats to make your own cool/funny/wierd racer! So, its a great game, REALLY fun, but don't buy it unless you have a really powerful computer."
3,Bak-Flip - How long it lasted - 3 years.,"I bought a Bak-Flip Tonneau Cover in March 2007 for my F-150. It worked fairly well until about March 2010, when the pieces started to come apart. I am not a contractor and use the truck for personal use hauling the usual stuff around. I would say it gets light to normal usage. It now needs to be replaced. I am not sure how long these things should last. Frankly, I would have expected more than 3 years of usage. Be guided accordingly."
1,Poor design for full size truck.,"I purchased this product for my Nissan Titan after seeing the generation one on a neighbor's small toyota truck. After shipping I found a minor ding that I bent out, not enough of a problem to ship all the way back. After installing the product there was a noticable sag in the middle. This product just does not span that big a distance, poor design. I built a support for the middle of the bed just to give it strength. Cover leaked from day one, again I think it is a design flaw. I will admit the cover looked great initially! After 2 years the cover started coming apart. Rivets had fallen out and panels were seperating. After less then 2.5 years I have taken the cover off and thrown it a way. Would not recommend to anyone else with a full-size truck. Be Careful~!BAK 26503 BakFlip G2 Truck Bed Cover"
4,Wonderful,"I thought Jill's approach to scrapbooking was refreshing. The book is so well laid out with so much attention to small details, she brings fresh, unique ideas to the technique. The speacial effect ideas are stunning and alot easier to create than you would think! Overall, it is the accessibility of the book that impressed me the most, it is a must-have manual for beginners and pros alike."
4,Inspiring,"I think we have all gone to the store and gotten excited over the newest items in the isles and just had to have them. When we get them home we are not sure just where, when, or how to start with them and then they sit in the drawer. This is the book you need. It is presented and grouped by techniques such as Shimmering pages, Metallics, Inks, Chalks, Textures and more. Each of these chapters explains multiple techniques to achieve the given effect. Each project has a full list of materials needed, a helpful hint and a degree of difficulty. You can't go wrong with this one."
3,a little dated,"This book may have been imaginative for it's time, but had I seen this book in a store I never would have purchased it. I felt the layouts were dated and lacked that POP we are looking for. Some of the technique suggestions were good, but it was an overall disappointment."
2,I don't like,"If I've had an opportunity to saw this book before buy it, I didn't it.In my opinion the layouts showed in this book are overshot and simple; I don't recommend!"
5,An instant favorite,"I cannot say enough good comments about this book without sounding like I'm being paid. The realiy is this book was my instant favorite. I read it once and could not put it down. I read it a second time with my highlighter in hand. Now, I have an official working copy. I bought this book in HI on my honeymoon without a guitar in sight. When I returned home, I tore into every one of my guitars (easiest first). Guess what? Now, they all play A++. I called a few friends and gave them some advice. I should have waited on the advice and bought them a copy of the book for Christmas. You will feel enlightened after reading this book."
4,Review - How To Make Your Electric Guitar Play Great,"A thorough walthrough of just about all steps for setting up your fave axe toplay properly.Inspecting your guitar before buying it second hand or new,cleaning and repair, setting up stringheight intonation trussrods etc,adjusting tailbridges saddles and vibratos.Dan covers a range of different guitarmodels as a fulcrumfor bringing his point and knowledge home.If you want to tinker experiment oradjust your electric guitar to your own style and taste,this book has a lot of useful information.Personally I would love to see the pictures in the book with colorinstead of just black and white, for clarity and contrast.Some of the photos in this book look a bit washed out to me.This would probably raise the price of this very useful book though."
5,Why Didn't I Think of That?,"That's the reaction I have almost every time I use this book. I do agree with some of the other reviewers that this may not be the best book for the rote beginner. But if you have a bit of guitar playing and fixing experience, this is THE book that will get your prized guitars playing perfectly. Erlewine has a giant workshop full of tools, but most of us don't need anything more than some basic tools, patience and the confidence to do things like adjust the relief on a strat or tele neck and swap out stock pickups for better ones. His book gives you the confidence to do it."
4,Great Information for starters,"I use the book for reference when I need to do maintenance on my guitars. It tells you what to look for and how to fix problems that could crop up. The only problem I have with the book, is that it is kind of confusing when it comes to restringing a guitar. All my guitars have non locking tuners (never seen one that has those) but that is the main thing they talk about. That and the steps and illustrations aren't very clear. You need lots of pictures if you're going to show some one how to restring a guitar properly. The steps just left me confused as ever."
3,Not for Kindle,"This is a terrific piece of work by Dan Erlewine. But it is not Kindle friendly. That or Kindle technology is not friendly to reference works, such as this. When one wants information from this sort of work, it is not a read-through. Most often, one needs to find a specific topic, and read that part. Kindle's navigation is not good for this sort of reference. My suggestion: buy it; but buy it in paperback. (So I bought both !!)"
3,"Not perfect, but its got what you're looking for.","Although this book is entitled ""How to Make Your Electric Guitar Play Great"", this is not a ""how to"" book. It's laid out in chapters based on each process involved in any particular set up. The author guides you through each section with plenty of examples from his extensive personal experience. But while it's very informative and a decent read, this book doesn't serve as the step-by-step guide I was looking for."
3,Meh....,"There more things on YouTube than what is in this book. This seems more like a Stewart Mcdonald praise, 'Buy From Us' book."
5,This will improve your guitar's performance,"I bought this book to fine tune the mechanics of several of my guitars. I was having a problem with intonation on one and this book showed me how to fix the problem. Great book by a very experienced, well known guitar mechanic, Dan Erlewine. Great read, and covers many subjects. Highly recommend this book for all guitar players."
1,Pony waste of money!,"I can't believe that I have read any good reviews of this toy. This is the biggest piece of garbage I have ever seen. None of the so called snap in place pieces actually snap in place causing the castle to fall to pieces the minute my daughter tries to play with it. The Balloon gondala's basket will not stay attached to the balloon and the plastic straps are breaking at the point where they are attached to the balloon from having to constantly reattach them to the basket. I'm still not sure exactly how the baskets at the top of the I strongly discourage anyone from purchasing this product. Buyer beware, this is a huge waste of money!"
2,A pain in my pony!,This castle falls apart. My 6 year old became frustrated when playing with it due to all of the pieces raining down on her. Nothing is secure on this item. Very flimsy!
4,Don't!,"This toy is absolutely terrible! By all means its very pretty but you need to invest hours into putting it together. There were a million tiny stickers that had to be put on. Why weren't they already there? There was NO WAY that a child could have put this together, I had problems with it. The castle is not at all compact. The staircase in the front of the castle and the staircase inside has to be snapped out (which isn't hard cuz it falls everytime you move it). Some of the furniture has to be moved around also before the castle will close. When you try tomoveitafter you close it, it opens and furniture falls out. I was so frustrated midway of assembling it that I had to return it!"
2,Fall's Apart,"I purchased this toy on clearance even after reading the reviews here. My daughter loves playing with it, but spends most of her time putting it back together. Nothing stays attached to the castle and I am not even going to tell you how long it took to attach the stickers. I would not waste your money."
4,Great for imagination,I have a 7 and 4 year old girls and they play with this toy alot. They play with all there little ponies in this. My only complaint with the toy is that the terraces come off easy and the hot air balloon is not made well. The balloon didn't last long at all. Overall its a great toy
1,Wow what junk,My daughter recieved this toy for Christmas. Man what a oversight in production. I feel like making money on this product was more important than making a usable toy. Falls apart all the time. If I could come up with a way to glue the pieces on she would have fun.
2,falling apart!!!,"My daugher asked for this castle for x-mas and after reading all the reviews I decided not to get it for her. She kept talking about it and saying how much she wanted it even though she got 100 other great toys for x-mas. My MIL bought it for her for her 4th birthday this week. After an hour of putting all the stickers on it, she played with it for about 1 second before it started to fall apart. She has been playing with it on/off today but gets annoyed when the thing falls apart and she needs me to put it back together. For the most part she likes it but if it would stay together I think she would love it!!!!I wish I had never suggested MIL buying it for her, she would of eventually forgot about!! Now she is stuck with a toy that she wants so badly to play with but keeps falling apart...She's been jipped!!"
3,"Kids will love it, Adults/Assemblers will HATE it!","My daughter rec'd this for her 4th birthday. It took our entire family 2+ hours to assemble this nightmare... The instructions leave off after page 1, and I swear, you need 4 pages to understand all the parts. And don't even get me started on all the damn stickers! And another thing: the version of the castle pictured on the outside of the box, which is what prompted someone to buy it, did NOT match what was inside the box. There are too many pieces, too little instructions, AND, it can't even be folded/enclosed like the Twinkle Twirl Dance Studio. Skip this aggravation, and let your kids play with their friends' Celebration Castles."
2,falls apart too easily,"This toy is so annoying. Itfalls apart too often, but my daughter still loves it. I guess I would buy it if they really wanted it, but I think it's juts too annoying. I'll see how long her interest lasts."
4,Pain-free Pony fun,"Based on the reviews I'd read here, I had been putting off my daughter for over a year on the Castle. But after 14 months of consistent requests, I finally gave in for Christmas this year. I fully expected to be wrestling with this thing late into the night, but it wasn't at all bad. The stickers were tedious, but didn't take near as long as I'd been expecting based on what I'd read here. It went together as the instructions laid out and, more importantly, it has stayed together!! I haven't had to reassemble anything. My 5-year-old daughter has been in Pony-heaven since Christmas morning. She's been playing with it extensively and I haven't been summoned to reattach anything even once. The one thing that was exactly as 'advertised' from the reviews is the crown: it's useless and should just be made part of the turret. Other than that, it's been great and made a little girl very happy."
1,An Expensive Piece of Junk,"I bought the My Little Poney Castle last Christmas for my 3 yr. old daughter. I have never seen a toy so cheaply made! From the moment it was put together it started falling apart, and I knew it was going to be nothing but trouble. My daughter cannot even play with it because it continually falls into shambles the whole time she is using it. If I hadn't spent so much money on it I would throw it away! It should be taken off the market by the better business bureau in my opinion. It is a ripoff!"
4,A Glue Gun Helps!,"This toy is a serious pain to put together because nothing stays put! Grab a beverage & sit down with some hot glue, and it makes the toy usable. The tops come off if you slightly touch anything on it and the elevator is hard to move. And what is with the tiny stickers everywhere?! I got through half before it was beverage time again.But, my 5 year old daughter loves the toy. And it does play different tunes & light up. It also comes with cute accessories that are magnetically activated. I would say it was worth the $$$."
1,They will cry as they watch it fall apart,This was a horrible waste of money!! My girls saved their allowance for this only to watch it fall apart as they began to play! None of the pieces connecting to the castle stay on. We threw the crown and balloon away as they also did not work. Do not spend your money!
1,"It's cute, but it's also a real piece of cr@p.","My daughter has been asking for the Pony castle for 2 1/2 years. Even after reading all of the reviews, I went ahead and bought it because 1. daughter would continue asking for it until kingdom-come, and 2. I was hoping that it wasn't all that bad. Well, it was the biggest waste of money ever; if it weren't for the fact that daughter loves it, I would pack it up and return it. The smaller playsets (salon, dress shop, cafe) are a much better bang for your buck; go for those. The castle is a complete and utter disappointment. All of the reviews above that go into detail are absolutely correct; this castle is junk."
1,Worst Toy I have ever purchased,"I have three children and I purchased this toy for my youngest child and my neice. Both asked for it for Christmas last year. Not only was I disappointed buying this for my child, who only played with it once or twice, but I was so embarrassed that I bought it for my neice. It fell apart on Christmas Day and never stayed back together. In 20 years, this was probably the worst toy I have ever purchased."
1,waste o' money!,"My daughter got this for her 2nd birthday. I wouldn't pay $3.00 for this piece of junk. I ended up throwing it in the trash because my daughter didn't even enjoy playing with it. There are a million pieces and once you get it put together, the thing falls apart. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!! PLEASE!"
2,Cute but cheaply made,"My 5 year old daughter loves my little ponies and just had to have this castle. I bought it for her for her birthday. I was disappointed that the pieces do not stay on at all -they constantly fall off. The tops with the hot air balloon etc...just sit there dont attach well, barely bump it and everyting falls apart. It is cute if it sits in her room on display and is not touched.. not worth 39.99 thats for sure!"
2,frustrating toy,"As most reviews state, this toy falls apart, my review is no different. One review said they tried crazy glue to hold the pieces together with no success, well I used Gorilla Glue....""the toughest glue on planet earth"". Not tough enough for this castle. The pieces still fell apart. A child loses interest pretty quickly when the toy won't stay together. It's a very frustrating toy; for child and parent.And, my child has great difficulty using the elevator....the whole castle lifts up and tips over when she tries to use it....maybe it needs some oil!"
2,Breaks a lot,"I think my daughter truly loves her castle, but I really hate it's lack of durability. The main piece stays together well, but the little things have all broken off or never worked in the first place. If you have a little pony lover, this isn't the best buy for your money. Just get the horses."
2,My Little Pony Celebration Castle,"This toy constantly falls apart and is a big disappointment. Most of the time when we assemble toys of this nature the ""click together"" parts are very difficult to disassemble and very seldom come apart. (The Little People ""playset"" toys or the Fisher Price dollhouse for example). This castle has many parts which are constantly falling off during play and coming apart. Even my daughter who is 5 and is totally into all things ""My Little Pony"" commented on how frequently the castle falls apart. I don't mind some assembly when we get a new toy but I do expect it to stay together. I am continually putting the parts back on this thing so the kids can play. When I pick it up to put it away everything comes apart. Don't waste your time! This is very cheaply constructed (thin plastic molding and unacceptable design, i.e. parts that come unattached during play)."
2,Annoying Toy,"It is a cute toy. However, although the toy was fun to play with, it would continuously fall apart. I heat glued many parts to avoid having to constantly pick up the pieces that would fall off the castle during play. I found it very irritating and my daughter found it frustrating. We sold it in a garage sale the following summer.Also, give yourself plenty of time to assemble this one. Lot's and lot's of stickers!"
2,Lasted for an hour,"This toy is a ton of fun for my girls, however it was discouraging as a parent to see parts breaking off within an hour after set up. Once one part is broken, the next part will not fit correctly. Within a week we were down to the bare bones of the castle itself. Everything else had been destroyed due to the flimsiness of it and small hands trying to repeatedly trying to stick things on. Save your money."
2,Falls apart....over and over....,"Several complaints about this toy....first, the window balconies, and interior shelves constantly fall off. I'm going to have to succumb to super glue to stop this from happening. The castle is always falling apart!! The unit does not always stay on, and it's hard to figure out how to turn it on. We owned it for months before we realized it would play music! The balloon on top is always toppling off, and the elevator inside does not slide up and down easily. So, even though this toy is a royal pain in the rear, my girls still love it."
1,my little pony celebration castle,This toy is a piece of junk. Keeps falling apart. Would not recommend this toy to anyone.
2,celebration cast;e,"This toy does not stay put together once you assemble it. None of the pieces fit securely into the castle and they all fall off whenever you move the toy. The ""elevator"" has to be forcibly pushed up and down, and does not move easily. None of the attachments stay attached and there is not enough room inside the castle for the furniture if you want the ponies to be inside as well. I would not recommend this product."
2,castle falls apart...,"My 4 year old loves to play with this castle, however, every time she touches it, a piece seems to fall off! The castle does fold together, but it doesn't ""snap"" in place so everything falls out if you try to move it. It is fun for her to play with, but is it too much to ask that the thing might stay together. Don't waste your money, buy something else."
1,Great idea- cheap construction!!!,"Give me a break Hasbro! I spent hours putting this toy together. It fell apart as soon as it was consructed. I was so furious, I called HASBRO for a refund. What a disappointment!It is so cheaply made that it can't be played with!!!"
2,not worth the money or time,"My daughter just turned 4 and loves my little Ponies. She got this as a gift (despite the reviews) and hasn't played with it since we put it together, which was time consuming oh and the stickers, c'mon why aren't they prelabeled? She takes her ponies and plays with them in her durable doll house.Something on this castle falls apart as soon as you touch it. It's a cute idea, just very poorly made."
4,I.M.H.O not worth it,"My daughter seems to really enjoy this toy. (Which is why I gave it 4 stars on fun) But putting it together you can tell there was almost no pride in craftsmanship at the factory the castle does not close completely, pieces do not stay put together, in short its way to fragile for a 4-7 year old girl, it needs to be a lot more durable."
2,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,What a HUGE waste of money. Just like everyone says here - it falls apart - CONSTANTLY! The pieves dont even fit together. My 3 yr old got it for her nirthday and gets so frustrated because nothign stays together. Top that with the Care Bear Castle that falls apart and the Real Friends Playground which is a hunk-o-junk and she has nothing durable to play with at the moment. Heck - Her Little People stuff is always together! Anyway - spend your money on the ponies - but not this! Hasbro should refund us all!
1,Disapointed!,I bought this for my granddaughter for x-mas and my daughter tossed it in the garbage by the end of January due to the doors and other parts constantly falling off. I just wasted $40.00 of my hard earned money. I thought this would be durable and my daughter had to keep putting the parts back on all the time she said forget she had enough!
2,"I agree Falls apart....over and over....,",I'm so disappointed with toy. It is cheaply made and not well made. None of the parts fit well. I bought this for my daughter last Christmas. It a huge waste of money. She has never play with it. I would pass on this toy if I were you.
2,Assembly Required Again and Again and Again......,"We bought this toy for our youngest daughter's 4th birthday. She loves it, except for the fact that parts you have to attach keep falling off. The toy itself is fairly durable - only a ""rope"" on the hot air balloon has broken. My daughter still enjoys it from time to time, but looses interest when the parts have to be put back on too often. I've tried hot glue with parts on other My Little Pony sets, but eventually they come off then too. I will try the Super Glue idea and see if it works."
1,Two thumbs down.,Don't even bother. Everything falls apart and is highly frustrating to my 3 year old.
2,Good Concept...Poor Quality,"We had purchased this for our 3 year old daughter who absolutely adores My Little Pony. What a huge disappointment this was! The crown was so mangled out of the box that we were never able to mold it to the correct shape and had to throw it out without even being worn. The top turrets/platforms never quite click into place and are always falling off. The stairs are always coming undone. It just seems to be one thing after another and, quite honestly, my daughter isn't even rough with her toys. All in all, it was just a big letdown."
1,"Don't buy and if you did, return it!","What a piece of junk. This toy is impossible to put together and the pieces fall off if your child touches it. The elevator does not move easily at all, causing great frustration for a 3 year old. The baskets that hold the pony are supposed to snap in, they do not. This toy was very frustrating for my daughter. I plan to return it tomorrow."
5,My Little Pony: Celebration Castle,"I read LOTS of BAD reviews on this pony castle, but my daughter really wanted it anyway. So when my husband put it together, we expected it to fall apart into pieces, (So everyone said in thier reviews), shes 3 years old and has been playing with this castle for days now, and NOT ONE thing has broke or fallen off... I don't know why everyone has had a bad experience with this toy. My daughter is very happy with it, as to am I and i'm very surprised to find out that it is very sturdy, all the pieces fit nicely inside and NOT ONE THING has yet to fall off, maybe some parents just didn't know how to put it together correctly, we DIDN'T even need crazy glue like all the other parents used to put theirs together.. My 3 year old loves this toy and i'm glad I got it. And as for the stickers yes it took some time, but i put them on after she went to sleep for the night..."
1,Pony Castle Should be Called Pony Apartment,"My two year old daughter got this item for Christmas. She has wanted one for a couple of months now. Upon receiving this item, I noticed right away there was a lot of stuff to put together and a million decals to be put on. No problem. However, the pieces seem to be cheaply made and the crown that goes on top is flimsy and won't stay on. The music won't play correctly and the stage in front with the steps won't stay on. The furniture is nice, but the castle is really too small for all of it and there is little room for the ponies. This toy has the potential to be a really cute toy, but the parts make it impossible to have any fun."
3,BE PREPARED TO FIND MISSING PEICES,This is an excellent toy however there are very small peices that can definately become a nuisance if its not properly put away with mom or dad helping.The baloon is not very sturdy and its already deflated however it can be a lot of fun with proper adult supervsion when your little one is done playing. My daughter gets a lot of enjoyment out of all the pony topys they are all worth thier weight in gold and the prices on each of these toys are very resonable
2,Poorly built.,"""Santa"" brought this toy for my six year old daughter. It was the one toy that she wanted really badly. This toy was very poorly built. I was suprised how the top two pieces just sat on the top, they didn't snap on or anything. And the snap on pieces don't stay snapped on for very long. The stairs fall off, the drawbridge falls off, the top pieces topple over if you bump them. The only good things I have to say about it is that the music and lights are cute, the hot air balloon is cute, and the baby pony it comes with is adorable.I think 40 bucks is way too much for such a poorly built item. If you can talk your kids into something else, do it. They'd be better off."
3,Pretty and cute but falls apart too easily.,"We bought this for my 5 year old daughter, she plays gently. This toy came with pieces that do not snap on properly the turins just sit on top they do not snap on, so they fall off with barely bumping it. The plastic ropes that hold the hot air balloon together snap off constantly. I luckily got this 1/2 off for $$$$ but I would be more upset if I had paid full price. My daughter loves my little pony, it is pretty - if it just sits there and is not touched. I am disappointed in the quality of this product."
3,This toy is okay.,"The first time my sister got it, we ripped open the box and thought it would be the best toy ever! Now, we hardly ever play with it. But Every once in a while, my sister will pull it out and use other toys with it."
2,Good for Displaying a Collection,"This ""toy"" offers a great way to display a collection of My Little Ponies, since each pony can be set to stand on a different floor/platform. The castle itself can easily display over 18 ponies, with room out in front for other My Little Pony scenes (such as the tea, birthday, or slumber parties). Room in the furniture, and a hidden drawer, offer space to keep accessories (combs, barettes, crowns, etc). I would NOT recommend this ""toy"" for play unless you're gentle and patient."
2,Sends kids running back...... for repairs?,"My girls could not play with this toy without it falling apart. We tried super glue, to no avail. the problem is as soon as you glue a piece another pops off. We have returned this toy. you pay good money for this. You should not hear "" mommy can you fix this"""
1,Buyer Beware!!!!,"I purchased the MLP Castle for my 5 yr old as a gift from Santa. What a disappointment!! I wish I had checked out some of the reviews beforehand - all of the snap on balconies didn't stay on, I didn't know what to do with the turrets and the stickers, my goodness, I gave up when my vision started to become blurry! I have never been so unhappy with the quality of a toy - we have purchased several of the smaller sets (cotton candy cafe, salon and blooming blossoms) they are much better quality in my opinion...As for the castle, it was returned 2 days after opening it and my daughter got the Fisher Price Friendship Pony Stable and she loves it!!"
1,Do Not Buy!!!,This toy was a huge disappointment. I bought it for my 3year old daughter. I feel so bad when she tries to play with it because it will not stay together. The pieces are always scattered everywhere. The concept is cute but it is poorly designed. It fell apart the first time she played with it. Do not disappoint your little girl with this toy!
1,Get out the liquid nails,"You have to be kidding me! My daughter is majorly into My little pony, so she had to have the castle for her birthday. After hours of trying to understand the misleading directions I was totally frustrated. Nothing that ""snaps"" into place actually snaps or stays there. Nothing that ""presses"" is even remotely going to stay put (that's in reference to the turrets for those of you who have one...and why are all the holes there?). Try the word set instead. Set into place maybe. Is Hasbro crazy. For $40 I shouldn't have to put on 40+ stickers while a child crys to play with it. And the crown, don't even get me started. It's flexible and comes apart at the slightest touch. Don't understand the notches next to the holes on that one either. So many problems. But what are you to do when a child wouldn't part with it for their life. Try Liquid Nails...it worked for us. Just don't glue down the mote or you won't be able to change the batteries. Hasbro is getting a note on this one!"
4,Not well built!!,"This toy is very cute and would look nice on a shelf. My daughter loves my little pony, BUT she gets very frustrated with this castle. Everytime she moves her pony something falls off. She can't move the elevater up and down without something falling off and the stickers are falling off which it took me an hour to put on. I found one review that someone really likes this toy and I think she or someone she knows works at Hasbro. Someone actually warned me when I was in line buying this toy and I didn't listen. I think I will listen next time. Hasbro, you can do better!!!!"
4,Buyer Beware,"I wish I had looked at the other reviews before making my purchase. Just like the other reviews, this toy simply FALLS APART! It was a lot of money for a piece of junk. One helpful hint for those of us stuck with this thing, grab your hot glue guns and prepare to glue away!!! (Make sure the kids are in bed or watching a video so they won't accidently grab the glue gun) - Next time I'm checking first! (I said ""4"" stars for fun because my 3 year old daughter still loves to play with the ponies)"
2,Disappointed in Hasbro,"I purchased the My Little Pony Celebration Castle for my daughter. After spending 45 minutes arguing with the castle to try and make it stay together we just set the piece that fall off in the hot air balloon that falls off the top of the castle. She has played with it once. I even emailed Hasbro with my concerns that for the money they wanted for this product it is poorly made. They had the nerve to send me a whopping $3 coupon. That is ridiculous. They charge parents $40 for a toy that if you breathe to hard near it, it falls apart. The crown is all disfigured from being squeezed into a small spot. And they expect children to be happy over their products. My daughter was so disappointed over this toy she hasn't touched it since. I would not suggest this toy to anyone who has a little child. It is a huge disappoinment."
4,Much better than expected!,"I was expecting the worst when I read the reviews of this toy, but there was no talking our 3 year old out of it! The hint about the super glue was wonderful, so that made all of the difference in the world. Our 5 year old helped me place the stickers...how bad can that be?The toy is played with daily. Both girls love it. The elevator is the lamest part of the toy, but they use that to store all of the accesories."
1,DO NOT BUY,"I am giving one star in durability because there is nothing less. My 5 and 3 yr. old daughters got this from ""Santa"" otherwise it would be back at the store. She does not want to play with it because she says if she moves something everything else falls. For a toy that is [$$$], it does not work. The towers do not hook, the balconies keep falling off and the stairs that attach to the outside do not stay attached. DON'T make the mistake I made in buying it."
3,Pain in rear to put together,"My 4yr old daughter received this MLP Celebration Castle as a gift. My mother and I picked it out for her at target and it was on clearance for $20.(now I see why) I used to play w/MLPs when I was her age and she also owns a MLP so I thought this would be fun for her. Well it took me at least 45mins to get the stickers off the sheet and put them on and then trying to figure out where they go is a nightmare too. Also hooking on the balconies and such i had a hard time getting them to snap on and the crown came all bent up, there's no way my daughter could supposively put this on her head. But all in all she seems to like it so far and she likes the MLP theme song it plays and lights up. Just make sure when you get this out of the box that you have plenty of time and patience to put it together when you're daughter is wanting to play with it asap."
1,VERY DISSAPPOINTED,"My 3 year old daughter wanted this castle for Christmas pretty badly! Well, we bought it for her and I was so disappointed with it and the quality of it. The pieces do not stay on it and the stickers were a complete nightmare! It is definitely not kid friendly since you have to continue to try and put the pieces back on after they keep falling off! I did return it and she was okay with that since it seemed to be to much of a pain to play with!!"
2,A Christmas Eve Nightmare,What a horribly constructed item! Pieces do not snap together or stay together. We decided to get the hot glue gun out and glue the pieces together that did not stay. The stickers did take about an hour to put on. All in all my daughter was very happy to get it from Santa. I just advise before giving it to your child take time and patience to put this together. I recommend glueing pieces together so they dont fall apart. I sure am surprised that this item was so horribly constructed for us consumers. I did let Hasbro Know how unsatisfied this item was. We will see if they even care!
2,Piece of Cra,"That's exactly what I told My Little POny in an email message. This castle is terribly constructed as the other 30 reviews say. They are sending my a shipping lable to return it and they will send mem a new one. From the website it looks like they have made some changes, we'll see."
3,what a nightmare,"I bought this toy for my little girl who turned 4. I was really excited since I grew up with my little pony. I was highly disappointed when I opened the box. There were a ton of sticker decals that had to be put on, the crown would not stay fastened, and the parts of the castle fall off if they are barely touched. Not to mention the touretts don't &quot;snap on&quot;, they sit there. I have to say that this toy is the biggest piece of junk and is not worth the money. The only thing that keeps me from throwing it away is my daughter who would be very disappointed!"
1,don't waste your money!,"My 3 1/2 year old just had to have this toy, but after it took FOREVER to put it together, she played with it for about 2 minutes and barely looks at it now. She only plays with the pony which is not worth $... alone. I am very disappointed in the quality of this toy. Like everyone else says, ALL the accessories that ""snap"" into place fall off for no reason. The crown couldn't fit a baby's head. Even my daughter can tell it's a crappy toy.DON'T BUY THIS TOY! IT IS JUNK!"
3,They should sell it with a glue gun.,"From the second we put this thing together it wasd falling apart...I tried to put it back together but 10 minutes later my daughter would bring the part back to me crying because she thought she broke it. I finally had to use a Hot Glue Gun to keep it together.In Fact...they should sell it with a glue gun. Even though I finally got it to stick together, my DD wants nothing to do with it because if past experiences. It was a waste of money and dissapointing."
1,Very frustrating!,"My 3 year old twins love ""My Little Pony"" and even they lose interest in this toy quickly because it keeps falling apart! The hot air balloon broke after 2 days of use, the turrets keep falling off, the spinning things are too frustrating, the balconies fall off constantly, the ""elevators"" run jerkily so that everything falls off when you use them, and the ""crown"" for the girls doesn't stay on at all. We're keeping the little pony and the little hairbrush, comb, etc and ditching the rest of the castle in the trash!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This toy is not worth the cost. I bought it for my five year-old daughter last Christmas and I think she has played with it a handful of times. It is flimsy and the parts do not fit together well at all. I would not recommend it. Looks cute on the box and in the commercials, but that is the only positive thing I can say about it."
3,not very durable,"My daughter asked for nothing else last Christmas, but this castle for her My Little Ponies. So of course, it was the first thing I purchased for her. After putting it together on Christmas Eve, I was so frustrated I could have thrown the entire thing away. None of the pieces stay attached to the castle as they are supposed to and the balloon and crown that sit on top of the castles towers fall off all of the time. My daugther was very excited with it and does play with it regularly, but I'm always putting it back together while she's playing since the balconies are falling off and the towers are falling down too. I even tried superglueing it together, but the glue doesn't seem to hold the plastic pieces. Its definately not worth the money I spent on it."
1,will fall apart in one day,If you want to loose your money this is the best toy to buy. It will last one day. Is ts so sad that my girl keep crying every time that she play with it.
2,Unhappy with celebration castle,"My daughter received this as a birthday gift. Once we put it all together and allowed her to play, it began falling apart. She has hurt herself when pieces fall apart when she tried to place a pony on the balcony or door. Everytime you move a pony around something seems to fall off. I don't think this toy was well made and presents something of a hazard to a child wanting to play with it. I am very unhappy with this product."
1,Cant keep it togeather,This toy is such a rip off my daughter begged me for it. It is hard to set up and if your child moves it forget it it falls apart in seconds. There has been more tears then laughter over this toy!!! I wish I could return it!!!!!
2,Broke Within A Day,My girls are way into MLP's so the celebration castle was a must for christmas. We were disappointed when the hot air balloon broke the first day and one of the other components broke the next day. Since then my girls haven't been interested in playing with a broken toy.
2,Not impressed,This toy would be a lot more fun if it were more durable. Pieces come apart with even gentle play. My kids never play with it.
2,Huge Disappointment,"...This was a huge disappointment, especially as it was rated one of the top 10 toys of the year. The directions were confusing and the stickers didn't stick well. The ""turrets"" fell off every time my daughter tried to move the ""elevator"". Trying to spin the ponies on the ""spinning disk"" toppled the whole thing over more than once. I'm just thankful I bought this on sale and saved $12; no way this toy is worth $40."
4,Lots of pony fun!!! But be ready to pop stuff back on!,"This is lots of fun for little girls into ponys..my daughter who is 7 got this toy but she just didnt really care for the ponys but my 4 year old daughter thinks its the best thing in the world! It plays music and has some lights and is perfect for pretending! My only drawback on this product is there are a lot of things that pop on and unfortuneately they pop off just as easily..I feel like I spend half the day popping things back on for her. So even though it's a fun toy, just be prepared to pop things back on all the time"
3,Bring out the hot glue gun...,"This castle has too many parts and when you do put the parts in place (i.e. balconies) one little bump and they come off. It took too long to put on several silver sticker stars too. The star stickers would have been fun for an older child but my daughter is 3 and she would have had them everywhere but the right places.""Santa"" brought this castle to my 3 year old for Christmas and after seeing how rickety it was it sat in the box until 3 months later. That is when I finally had some time to hot glue the items on for good and now my daughter enjoys it."
2,Wouldn't buy another MLP toy,"We bought the Celebration Castle, Cotton Candy Cafe, and Jewelry box for our 3 year old for Christmas. Parts continually fall off all three as other reviewers have noted. I am not one to complain, but these were not worth the money. My daughter rarely plays with them because she spends more time calling me to fix parts. However, we previously bought Butterfly Island and it has held up a little better."
3,Pony castle,"Ok, I read the reviews before I bought this item for my 3 year old and I thought well what the heck. Well they were right - the crown is flimsy and will not stay together. The balloon ""strings"" were bent and when I tried to straighten, I was afraid they would break. Other than that my daughter loves playing with it with all her ponies. I guess that is all the matters......"
2,Dissapointing!!!,"I bought this toy as the highlight of my 4 yo's christmas. THIS TOY FALLS APART CONSTANTLY!! It is very cute, but not at all durable. My daughter also loves My Little pony, but even this toy dissapointed her. the directions are poorly written. Wouldn't buy again."
2,Disappointing,"We have been disappointed in this toy overall. It primarily sits on my daughter's toy shelf and collects dust. It falls apart easily, which frustrates her. The crown at the top is bent and won't stay on her head or on the castle, and the big pink heart won't stay on, either. She has only played with it a few times since Christmas last year. Don't waste your money on such a large, space hogging toy that won't get played with anyway."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!,"We bought this for my daughter for Christmas...and just like everyone else says, it sucks! We didn't mind putting on the stickers, but when it came to everything else, it fell apart. I even called Hasbro to complain, and they are sending new balconies and a new crown to see if that helps. The guy on the phone told me...they never heard of this problem before&;yeah right! I told him..that I was VERY upset and that I'm about ready to glue it all together! (I would have bought the cheaper castle, but it didn't come with the accessories). My daughter does love it, but she too gets very frustrated with it."
2,Manufacturer should be ashamed!,"We bought this as our daughter's big Christmas gift, and it is very disapointing. The directions (if you can even call them that) basicly tell you where to put all the little stickers. The battery area is covered by the moat and stairs, but if you ever need to replace the batteries, don't worry because the moat just falls off. The turrets on the top are supposed to snap into place. I for the life of me can not figure out how when the top piece is about 1/4 inch smaller than the bottom piece. It looks like they changed the design and we got one part from the old design and one from the new. So every time someone jiggles the castle, the turrets and ballon fall on my daughter's head. What fun is that?"
1,Do Not Buy This Toy!,This castle is a HUGE waste of money. It is constantly falling apart every time my kids touch it. I don't think I would even give this toy away because it is so awful!
2,please!!! do not buy this!!!,"like the rest of the parents trying to get just what their little one wants, i purchased this for my three year old's birthday. NIGHTMARE!! all the ""snap on"" pieces fall right back off. the ""crown"" went straight into the garbage, it is just such a piece of junk i can't believe they are selling this. i have four kids, have put together countless toys and this is by far the worst product i've had to deal with.please, just get a nice fisher price product instead and save yourself the headache, and the hour of putting on about a hundred little silver heart stickers...."
1,Awful!,I bought this castle for my 5 year old and must say it has to be the cheapest made toy that I have bought thus far! The crown won't fit and the parts fall off everytime she plays with it. Don't waste your money.
3,A Big Disappointment,"My 3 1/2 year old daughter begged for this toy for Christmas. ""Santa"" brought it for her, but his little elf...namely me...was frustrated with the hundred little stickers (roughly the size of the tip of a pencil eraser), not to mention the ""click-on"" parts that do not click on. Move this toy even a little bit, much less try to play with it, and the balconies, turrets, and second floor fall off. (The turrets are supposed to ""press on""...to what?) The crown was so mis-shapen, there is no way any little girl could wear it. The music, while not being overly loud, sounds like the a tinny music box that is playing at too slow a speed. If my daughter was just a little older, I would try to convince her that Santa would not be offended if we returned the toy to a store and picked out something of better quality. Since that probably is not possible, I will have to settle for a tube of crazy glue. I usually read reviews here before buying a ""big"" toy...I wish I had in this case."
2,sad to say we had to return it,"After fixing this castle on a daily basis, I had to return it. The frustration in my daughters eyes every time she touched it and it feel apart crushed me. We went today and exchanged it for the Disney castle. The castle took two minutes to put together and two minutes to put away. It is such a better quality and a she is completely Happy."
3,Celebrate Renovation Castle when ready to buy!,"Unfortunately, the negative reviews were not present upon my purchase of this castle. I was reluctant b/c I've had bad luck w/Hasbro. It was more age appropro for my 3 1/2 yr old instead of the Care Bear castle she wanted. I suggest velcro for the turrets (sticky kind.) Our music works well. The crown does fall apart. It's as if Hasbro hastily assembled them in time for Santa shipments...I know 3 other families whose 3 yr old wanted this and I won't recommend it to anyone I run into. Our porches fall off as well as the ""pond."" The second floor slips out too. My daughter has not gotten frustrated but as an adult consumer...""Hasbro is not looking to pass these down as collector's items for future kids."" It's definitely characterized as a ""disposable toy"" in our household! YIkes! So be ready to do renovations...this is a ""fixer-upper!"""
2,Poorly Made,"We bought this for Christmas. Here we are 3 days later and it isn't really played with even though this was my daughter's most desired item. All of the snap in pieces fall off when barely touches. The crown won't stay together. The elevator is nearly impossible, even for me, to raise and lower. I read other reviews about supergluing the pieces together so I will be doing that so she can play with it."
1,Poor Quality,I would agree with the poor reviews on this one. It was a gift for my 3 yr old daughter - and fell apart from day one. Had to continually put pieces back on - and I do not agree that it's just the way these kind of toys are. I have other toys of a similar nature that do not require constant re-assembly. I'd not recommend this toy to anyone!
1,Won't stay together,"I purchased this castle for my daughters, ages 3 and 5 at the time. The castle balconies, steps, crown, balloon ties etc. would NOT stay on the castle, I even tried to super glue them and they still would fall off. My daughters would get frustrated and so would I after being asked to put it back together over and over again. I contacted the company and they sent me a new castle but the same thing happened. I would not recommend this toy. Though it is cute it just isn't worth the money."
5,Great Toy,"I read all the previous reviews and I was concerned about things falling off the castle. However, the only thing that comes apart is the attachable heart and sometimes one side of the hot air balloon which is easy to attach by an adult. I have a 2 1/2 year old and she is not destructive and she LOVES this toy. I think you should disregard all the negative reviews and PURCHASE this toy. I have not regretted it in the month we have had it. The Dance Studio is great, too.If your child loves My Little Pony then, you HAVE to BUY the CASTLE."
1,Most disapointing toy ever,My five year old wanted this soo bad. Now she never plays with it. It falls apart. None of the decorations (crowns etc..) stay where they should. She is so upset.
2,Great toy with a lot of extra help,"My 4 year old daughter received this when she was 3 and I threw it away afer getting tired of it falling apart; even superglue didn't work. I was sad to see her receive it this year from a relative, but she loves MLP so much that I was determined to keep it. I hot glued everything! It's 2 months later and nothing has fallen off and my daughter and 16 month old son love the castle and don't mind that it looks like wax has dripped all over everything. Hasbro should be ashamed of themselves for selling this product. My Little Pony is a money making machine (we have a herd of at least 30 ourselves) and the horses themselves hold up great but the accessory products are something that shouldn't be sold in a dollar store."
2,Poor purchase,I have two daughters who enjoy My Little Pony but the products produced by Hasbro are poor quality. The castle took a good 45 minutes to place all stickers and figure out that the crown will never stay in place. When it comes time for play the castle will not stay together. Dress shop is the same poor quality.
2,The bad reviwes are a 100 %true,"My daughter ( 3)one this toy for Christmas so Santa got it for here, it took us like a one hour to put it together maybe more. When it was finelly that I realized that it did not work. I wont exchanged it for another one.Some parts are so small that they just disaper the next day.I recomend to everybody buy your kind another toy this one is not good at all."
2,"If on sale - buy it, otherwise, it's not worth the money","My daughter wanted this toy for her birthday, so I bought it. It's a cute concept, but it is very cheaply made, and it never closes up right and the pieces do not latch on properly (they keep falling off). I would have taken it back, but my girls do like playing with it. They don't seem to mind it falling apart all the time."
1,What a waste!,I have to say that I am absolutley disappointed with this castle. First of all you have to put the whole castle together BUT everything keeps falling apart because it was made So cheaply. It's not sturdy at all. I would not recommend this to anyone. It's definitley not even worth what they ask for it either. Buy it and you will find out. Seems like maybe you have to superglue every piece to make sure they wont keep falling off.
4,Hasbro was to quick to put this on the market,"To begin with the first castle that we bought didnt work. After sticking on all the stickers and assembling it, the music failed to work. So, with a broken hearted daughter in tow I returned it for a new one that worked. Thankfully it played the music. In my opinion, Hasbro was to quick to throw this on the shelves for Christmas. It is SO flimsy and the stickers fall off. I tried to make it stay put with hot glue but that didnt help. I finally used model glue to get it to stay together. This has fixed the falling apart problem. All in all this is a parental nightmare in a box. I just hope the toy manufacturer takes all these reviews into account and they fix ALL the problems."
4,No Problem Here,We received this castle as a christmas gift for my 4 year old daughter. We have had no problems with this castle what so ever the elevator works just fine. it took me about 20 minutes to get the sickers on the castle! Other then that this is the only toy my daughter got for christmas that she still plays with on a daily basis. If you add other ponies its adds to the fun with the magnet is the hoof- makes the the dance floor light up.We have no problem with any parts falling off and i did'nt have to glue anything together and no i dont know any one at hasbro!!! This is just a great fun toy and with the added ponies(sold separately) it adds to the adventure.
2,Disappointed with Toy,I thought my 4yr old daughter would love this toy however she barely plays with it due to the thing falling apart. Every piece of plastic that attaches to the castle falls off at a single touch. The small star stickers took us 1 hour to put on and I find them all over the house and not on the toy. This is a very disappointing toy that was way over priced. Save yourself the [money] and don't buy it.
2,Pony Junk Castle,"All of the reviews are right this is the biggest piece of JUNK I have ever seen. Compare to other items my 3 year old received for Christmas this is to be ashamed of. It took me, a 32 year old college grad two hours to finally finish putting it together due to all the small stickers.Still have not figured out what is up with the turrets at top of castle. The partial directions say to press in place,there is nothing to press???if you are lucky the turrets will balance on top for a minute or two before the earthquake of using the elevator or your 3 year old trying to play with a crumbling Castle. Buyer beware not worth a penny!!!"
1,Not Impressed,Not very durable. This product has many parts and they keep falling off of the castle. The crown never stayed together and my daughter was very disappointed. Do not recommend this product at all!!!!!!
2,Just Dissapointed,"Yup! It's all true. One of the worse toys I've had to deal with in a long time. It looks so beautiful on the box. My daughter was thrilled to have Santa deliver this today, Christmas. But I am so dissapointed. Just pieces everywhere. Nothing stays together. The insructions say ""Press into place."" It's more like glue it into place otherwise its not sticking. The last thing I need is a toy that is clearly going to be a bigger hassle than fun. I will return it tomorrow. Unless you have money to burn, buyer beware of this castle. It's really a big dissapointment."
2,Not worth the money,"I was very disappointed with this toy. My daughter does play with it sometimes but I am constantly putting the pieces back together. I even glued the pieces on with a glue gun and that didn't help, everything fell off again quickly."
2,What A Shame!!,"My two girls were so excited about this toy in the store that I purchased it for one of their birthdays. What a shame, after about one and half hours, and a splitting headache, of putting on stickers, it was ready to play with. Everything started falling off- the second floor, the valance, the balloon, and the crown holder. I would get all the pieces back in order, then they would try to move the elevator. This was almost impossible (as the elevator sticks at each notch), and it sent all the toys falling to the ground, again! The ropes to the balloon started breaking the minute I moved them down to attach them to the base. This toy has been the biggest aggrevation and waste of money yet."
3,Hard to keep together,My daughter received this for Christmas last year. She loves it but doesn't play with it much because it falls apart easily. She get frustrated and moves onto other toys.
2,A TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT,This toy was a birthday gift for my 4 year old daughter. It took quite a bit to put it together and as she's playing with it the pieces fall off.It is not made well and not durable to say the least.I am truely disappointed with this toy.
1,"Disappointing, frustrating toy (ended up in the garbage)","From the moment we bought this toy, we were absolutely shocked with how horribly it was made. The pieces did not snap together properly whatsoever. While I was connecting one part, another piece fell off. I could not even handle this toy with out it falling to pieces... imagine a 3 year old trying to enjoy this!! It had the potential to be very cool, since it has a lot of great colors and neat things for the ponies to do, but since it broke every time we even so much as moved it, I had to throw it out. Don't waste your money on this!!!"
2,Don't Buy This Toy!,"I was so excited to buy this for my 4 year old niece for her Birthday. She loved the gift, but I did not like spending most of the day putting it together, and when it fell apart, back together again! The stickers were ridiculous, so many! I read some of the other reviews only to find out how others kept the pieces together. My niece continues to play with it because she loves it, but it is such a nuisance, you find pieces of the castle everywhere!Don't waste your money, unless your special little girl really wants it!"
1,Complete Garbage!!,"I bought this for my friend's daughter as a birthday present, and got stuck spending over 2 hours at her party trying to get it together! The pieces would not snap together properly, and would not stay on. I also do not understand why a toy company would make the customer put on so many darn stickers! There had to be at least 100 of them, and most of them were so tiny that I didn't even waste my time trying to get them on. I was completely disappointed, but even worse, the birthday girl was disappointed. Don't waste your money!! This is the worst manufactured toy I've seen in a long time!"
1,High Maintenance!,"My three year old has plenty of fisher price toys that hold up better than this. She got the Loving Family Doll house for Christmas and it is holding up much better than this. Also, she plays with the Loving Family Doll House more than this cheap thing. She got this as a belated Christmas present and I was surprised to see the price online considering how poorly it is made and how little it offered. I figured it would be a [$$$] toy. I am thinking about taking it back since she has not played with it and it frustrates both of us to keep putting it back together. Nothing stays put after assembly."
2,extremely disappointed,My 3yr old daughter got this for Christmas and it doesn't work like it should the music doesn't play and the lights don't light up.I've e mailed the company 3 times with no response.The crown is all mashed up it wont straighten out or stay hooked.Do not waste your money.My daughter did play with it a little but I wish it worked like it should of.
2,A real disappointment,"We purchased this toy and returned it the next day. I just read a review that said it was a great toy and had to share my story so that people would not be mislead by inaccurate reviews. My daughter really liked this toy until she tried to play with it and it started to fall apart. Almost everything on it that is attached will fall off. We had to adhere 100+ stickers, which unfortunately I took the time to do before we realized what a piece of garbage it was and returned it. The My Little Pony Sweet Shop and Beauty Salon are great, I would encourage anyone to invest in those instead of buying your child such a frustrating and disappointing toy."
2,Dont Buy~~~,"On the plus side, it is pretty. But very annoying. The castle does fall apart very easily. Some parts dont stay on at all. The elevator does not go up and down easily. I figured that was what the batteries were for. Instead there is one spot on the castle you can touch with the magic ponys paw and hear the my little pony theme song, and see 3 small stars light up. We took the batteries right out. My 14 month old or 4 1/2 year old does not like this toy much. Nor do I ~ since it always falls apart. TOtally a ripoff! Way too much money to spend for junk."
1,DISAPPOINTING! Save your money!!,"We bought this for Christmas for our 2 daughters, ages 2 and 5. They love My little Ponies and practically begged for this castle from the time they saw it. Like a fool, I bought it before even reading any of the reviews! Boy was it a waste of money. First of all, it is not AT ALL durable. The snap on pieces fall off immediately, the hundreds of stickers are a nusiance, the elevator barely moves at all..even the door fell off!! As a matter of fact, I am sitting here looking at it right now and there's not a piece still attached that was supposed to be. My daughters played with it right after I got it together (which took about 2 hours) and gave up on it after it starting falling apart right away. They haven't touched it since.Do yourself a big favor and skip over this one! Don't waste your money!"
2,Fall apart castle,What a piece of junk dont waste your money. It is supposed to snap together just like the directions say Uh Yeah Right. Everything falls off and the music works only once in a while. If you ever so slightly touch or even look at the balcony funny it falls off.
4,Pretty but needs improvement,"This toy gave me a major headache during assembly. Dozens of tiny little stickers and poor construction. Lousy instructions. The pieces you are supposed to ""snap on"" don't stay put. It's very, very pretty....BUT I don't think it will still be in one piece a year from now.Your toy development crew should take a lesson from those at Fisher Price--a toy CAN be made that is cute and durable at the same time."
3,I didnt get Pink Sunsparkle with it at all,"my dad got this for me last weak online and it finaley got hear and i was so happy with it,i put it togeather all by my self,and so far it seams to hold up ok,nothings fallen off ecept for the pink balcony things,but my dad got it hear and i wanted the pink sunsparkle beause its cute but insted i got a purple thing and no pink sunsparkle,i still like to look at it and stuf,its just not what my dad orderd to have or that they avertized"
1,What a piece of junk!,"My 3 yr. old daughter received this as a gift for Christmas from relatives. It's without a doubt the most cheaply made toy she has EVER owned. How bad was it? The crown would not stay together, the heart constantly fell off & the 2 pieces of the castle towers would not stay on...if anyone touched either of the towers, the little ""bowls"" fell off! I got so fed up that 3 days after Christmas I threw the castle in the garbage. I am upset that money was spent on such a poorly made toy. This is the first time I've ever written a review, but I feel people need to know what they'll be getting if they buy this toy."
4,GREAT TOY FOR THE MLP LOVER,"My daughter, who is a HUGE MLP fan, received this as a Christmas gift last year. Yes, there are some flaws that could stand to be ""fixed"". But, for the money, this is a great toy for the MLP lover. The pieces that I had problems with were 1) the ""crown""...it was made wrong and never really fit. 2) most of the peices that had to be ""placed"" never really stayed on. But, my daughter took them off most of the time anyway. It is a really cute toy!"
2,Who designed this thing?,"The concept of this castle is cute but the execution is seriously flawed. You have to bang on the elevator to make it go up and down and when you do all of the furniture falls out. The decorative plastic shapes at the top of the castle NEVER stay on. The turrets DO NOT stay put; I had to velcro them to the castle. The crown won't sit on anyone's head and it constantly pops off its base. I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS TOY TO ANYONE! If you feel that you must buy it for the little girl in your life, get some velcro and a big tube of super glue to go with it."
4,great toy,"i love this castle. it has an elevator, a toy chest, a kitchen and a small bedroom! i do have trouble setting the pieces when they fall but with my moms help it gets fixed! it stills falls apart but i have fun while its still standing in piece! anyawy, i like to call it the pony castles rise and fall!"
2,VERY POOR QUALITY,This toy is a peice of junk! It has so many peices that refuse to stay in place and just continues to fall apart as my daughter plays with it. I finally just threw out some of the excess peices. The balloon keeps coming off the basket and wont stay where its meant to. She loves her ponies and this was all she wanted last Christmas so I felt badly that I bought her such junk.
2,Falls apart,"My daughter received this toy as a birthday gift. Ugh! She has no interest in a toy that mom and dad constantly have to put back together. Everything pops off, the elevator does not move up and down nicely and it's hard for her to operate the elevator when it doesn't budge in her little hands. I read that someone used super glue to attach the peices back on, well we used Gorilla Glue ""toughest glue on planet earth"" nope, not tough enough for this pony castle, the peices still fell off. My daughter does not have much interest in it anymore....it will be in our next yard sale. She still loves her ponies though!"
2,too many pieces,"My daughter recieved this item for christmas as a gift...i wish i kept the box so i could return it! My daughter has totaly lost interest in it. It contains so many small stickers that is a major pain to put on, and none of the pieces stay together.Not very well made! And not worth 40 something dollars. I cant wait to toss the thing in the garbage!"
1,Your child will be dissapointed!,"I have never written a review for a toy, however my kids and I were so dissapointed with this castle that I hope to save someone else the trouble of ""buying and returning"". I have twin girls and this was all that was on their list to Santa so we got two castles. They were played with all of about 5 minutes before the ""Air balloon broke"". It also didn't help that a piece was missing from the box. The ""wearable"" crown is supposed to fit on the top of the castle, but does not. The age on the box says three and up(my girls are 4), but this toy will cause great frustration to any kid under 7 or 8 because the peices fall apart at the slightest touch. I do understand that toys will break when kids play, but trust me this is a cheaply made toy. Don't waste your time or money."
2,SS: Rune of the mill,"Hohne did it better, as have others. I read the first third of this book and found nothing new or particularly insightful in it. This is a re-telling of a familar story that's been told more compellingly by others. ""Once put down, it is impossible to pick up again,"" as someone else said.... In one word: mediocre."
1,How much is in the box?,"Hey knucklehead, maybe nobody is buying your product becacause NOWHERE in your ad do you list the content weight! DUH"
2,Its not a book,I recently received this in the post and although the content is fairly good i would like say that it should not be advertised as a book as it is really a magazine - this was a disappointment to me as I didnt feel it was worth the price.
2,Terrific fantasy story and almost relaxing to watch - but for the awful transfer!,Disgraceful transfer! Obviously no effort was made to find a decent copy. Seems as though someone stumbled onto a worn-out VHS copy in a shoebox and immediately decided to transfer it to DVD without even bothering to check it.Too bad - it's a relaxing and entertaining simple story to follow. But hard to watch.
3,Flight of the Lost Balloon,"I remember enjoying this movie when I first saw it as a child and was happy to see it available as I wanted to re-live the experience. While the quality of the movie left a lot to be desired (kind of scratchy visuals and sound), it was still fun to see how this kind of cheesy adventure movie could still capture someone's imagination."
3,Solid reporting but a bit narrow,"Writing was good but I found some typos. Wasn't much of a story here, actually, and that surprised me. Not about the battalion commander so the title misleads. It's good...but not the best around. Wanted more action, to be frank."
1,Just another reporter looking for a couple bucks,"This book is horrible. Skip it. just get 'Generation Kill' instead.John Koopman is right. He is no reporter as he states early in this rushed, hackneyed attempt at storytelling. Full of typos, I wonder if anyone really did proofread it.Also, the actual reporting of action doesn't even begin until page 111. The previous 110 pages of drivel are Koopman's life. Trust me, 5 pages would have sufficed.Poorly written, slow, and written a jarring short-sentence style, I will soon be listing it for sale here while it's still in hardback.AVOID!!."
3,"Comfortable, but bulky.","I work at a customer service desk all night and needed a more comfortable way of wearing my Plantronics duo pro headset. This accessory works reasonably well. It is a bit bulky for my taste, but it does the job. Like many accessories of this kind, it will rub against your ears and cause a bit of soreness unless you stretch it or widen it a bit before use."
3,OOOO Thats not good...,"This game would be SO GOOD if it wasn't so CHOPPY. It takes about 5 seconds to run 4 feet. It was difficult to do ANYTHING much less get deep into this game. It truly looks like a TON of fun, but a 400 mhz processor won't cut it. Maybe a 900 or a 1.5 Ghz. If you have a fast computer, this is the RPG for you. If you have a Pentium II, pass this one up, play Ultima Online instead."
2,A new low for Ultima-lovers,"If you're like me, you (unfortunately) put lots of faith in brand-name awareness. Having spent hundreds if not thousands of hours in this fantasy world throughout my high school and college days, it was a no-brainer to buy the grand ending of a great group of games. I mean they wouldn't burn us again, right? (Can you say Ultima8)Wrong.This game is pretty much unplayable, even with the best hardware. You are guaranteed to see a crash with this game even after the 2 patches available (after roughly 3 weeks in the market) are applied.I've got tons of memory (256meg), tons of processor (p3/500) and a voodoo2. It leaks memory and crashes a LOT.Still, I give it a 2 for the nice graphics, but that's it. The game play is very basic and non-imaginative; the puzzles are a joke (ahhh I see match the colors); the quests automatic... I'm wondering if this is the death of the RPG."
3,-Another reason to own a console-,"It's frustrating, to say the least, to find out that a game you highly anticipated wouldn't run if you kicked it; even on your new PIII 600 w/ 256mb RAM and a Diamond Viper 770. In my honest opinion, this game is in no way worth the headaches it delivers. patches or no patches"
3,3 stars is overly optimistic,"Needless to say the game is unplayable in its current state.Fine, they'll patch it and everything will be OK, right? WRONG. Thegraphics engine is extremely dated, doesn't properly support mip-mapping or filtering, only supports 640x480, and runs at a CRAWL on the highest-end system you can buy (Refrigerated Cryotech 1Ghz Athalon) on a DDR GeForce. You can forget it if you card isn't Glide, because the DX-7 ""support"" is a slide-show. The game's glaring crashes and bugs may be fixed in time, but you're fooling youself if you think they're going to re-write the graphics engine.Just because the game could have been good without the bugs, not buying this product is the ONLY way developers will stand up and take notice."
4,A final epic role-playing series,"All at once the once proud quest of the avatar is coming to a close. This epic role playing game introduces descisions. If you want to give this guy money or kill him. If you want to run away from the troll or try to kill him and get his dough. All of you descisions in this game has an effect in the game. This is a must have for everyone who, like James Tiberious Kirk said,"" If only I could make a difference."", ultimatly wants to make a difference."
2,This game had good potential to be awesome...,"I was looking forward to U9 for quite some time and when i finally got my hands on it i uninstalled it the same night i installed it. For one this game is the biggest resource hog i have ever seen, its about 700MB for minimum install and about 1.2GB maximum. Another thing is i have a AMD K6 2 400MHz w/ a TNT card and this game looked like a friggin slide show, the frame rates were terrible even when i turned down detail and sight distance. The bugs.. ahh the dreaded bugs! I'm not even going to get into that subject, theres too many! This game had some awesome potential to be the Game of the Year but OSI just had to rush it out for the holiday shopping spree insted of keeping it in development for another month or so. If they gave this game another month or so it would have been awesome, i would have rather waited longer than play this buggy piece of junk."
4,The Good and Bad,"First off installation of the game was easy enough for me. The game however, will be prone to crashes if you don't have enough virtual memory which is about 580 megs. The graphics are stunning to watch and the world of Britannia looks fantastic. I've been running this game on minimum requirements and it runs pretty good. The only time it will slow done however is when it tries to hide the fact that it is loading the terrain. I think it would be wise to run this game under Voodoo3. So all in all after the patch, I think that the game is fun to play and will keep you occupied for many hours."
4,"Good, but not great","Ultima Ascension is a good game, but do not expect it to live up to the standards set by previous Ultimas (Black Gate and Serpent Isle in particular). Also, the Direct3D support for this game is very poor. Make sure that you have a Voodoo-based card installed in your system before playing the game. Finally, make sure you have patched the game to its latest version (1.18f) before playing. Otherwise, you are in for an extremely frustrating experience."
5,A lot has been said about this one,"I pre-ordered Dragon Edition and took one week out of work to play. I wasn't dissapointed.Lots of people criticize the game, because the world is small, the voice acting poor, the characters are not deep enough... Just a few games stand so high that these are their only (minor) faults.I enjoyed the adventure feeling, the compelling environment, the quests, the exploring (yes, even a ""small"" world has lots of things to explore).I had player Baldur's Gate to the end before playing Ultima. I consider BG a great game, but it lacks depth, limiting itself to combat. This is exactly what Ultima isn't.Ultima makes you think. A sensation I thought forgotten when playing RPGs (sorry Diablo fans)."
1,Biggest dissapointment ever,"I have played all the Ultimas in my time and for the most part loved them all. I was one of the people standing in line for Ultima 9 when it came out. When I got home I put it on my computer right away. After about 2 hours I finally got it to install correctly, and found nothing but bugs and bad game play1) You have to do every quest exactly as your told to no matter what.2) Nearly every quest had a bug that made me reload at least one time usually ten times though.3) Where are these stuning graphics in this game. They were ok but nogthing compared to other games that came out at the same time.4) This is my biggest complaint. The game is choppy.... and Neither of the computers I put it on were .... The first one was a PII 400 with 320 Megs of SDRam and a TNT 2 graphics card, and the other is a PIII 1000 with 256 Megs of Ram and a Geforce3 and its still choppy!!!!So my edvice is to avoid this game like the plague!"
4,double 1/4 inch jack plate,"this was a good quality piece, very useful although slightly smaller than i thought...but it worked out nicely, and the price was right. being plastic, it simplifies wiring a 4x12 guitar cabinet as either mono or stereo, or different impedances. highly reccomended, but make sure you measure before buying...like i didn't....the three inch i thought i needed was actually a four inch, which meant i had to glue it on, instead of using screws. still, worth the price!!"
1,Very dry product,"I got these from a different site in 3 colors, they were all very dry and completely useless. Most of my makeup is from UD so I know their product well; You should avoid these. I don't know how you could blend them at all, if you can even get them on your eyelid after a lot of tugging and pulling. Maybe heat them up? I paid $4 or $5 for each of them, what a waste."
3,urban decay eye pencil,I guess I don't know how to use this so I gave it to my grand daughter. She thinks it is great so it gets a good review from her.
5,An out and out excellent book,"Rarely these days do you come across a technical book that gets to the bottom of the issues in a non-marketing manner and without using excessive technical jargon.At the bottom of it all, the complexities of building large applications are based on some practical issues as well as some theoretical computing issues. How these architectural issues can be addressed in a product independent manner is at the heart of this book.It was a pleasure to read again a non-verbose book showing the clarity of thought, and I strongly recommend it to any one interested in architectural issues of building large systems."
2,Could have been a great book ..,"I would agree with Bob Hoeppner's review..The topics in this book are really great. Non are covered in any detail unfortunately. There are a few obvious mistakes as well.However, from what I have seen in other comments and the contents of other books, it seems that the subjects covered are not covered in this way by any other publication. One has to buy multiple books to get the same overview. So may be this book is a must anyway.So with some added information, this could have been a classic. May be a future edition could have accomplished that. For now, I am left searching for more information from other sources about many the same topics this book is intended to cover."
1,Old Stuff,"I had high hopes for this book, but was very disappointed. Missing was detailed discussion of application integration technology and enabling standards, not much there to speak of. Also, some of the technical information was dated, and there was not a good architectural spin. In short it left me wanting more.If you're interested in a good book on application integration check out the books from Linthicum and Ruh, they are much better than this one."
5,A female bachata artist with a great voice and future.,"Valeria is one of the very few female bachata contemporary artists and with this cd I say she has tremendous talent and potential. Discovered and promoted by Luis Vargas, a veteran bachatero has enabled her to make an impact immediately. I had only heard one song on a compilation cd- #2 Hombre como tu and I was intrigued. The rhythm of this bachata is slow definitely I would place under the ""bachata del pueblo"" category and the lyrics all have meaning and are well express by Valeria's strong voice. All the bachatas are great and the surprise for me was that the merengues are as well. This cd has exemplary bachata and is worthy of your patronage. I give it 5 stars 10 if could for such a tremendous production."
2,Saving Sarah Cain,This arrived in excellent condition and delivery was speedy. The movie itself was very sappy...I guess I was suspicious of that. But I was disappointed. Usually I would like a story like this but it definitely was lacking.
2,Very disappointing,"This movie does not do the book justice at all! Beverly Lewis must've cringed watching it. After reading the book and loving it I tracked down the dvd and couldn't wait to watch it. However, the movie barely follows the book at all. The accents were terrible (Lyddie's was the only one that pulled it off throughout the whole film), they totally changed the character's personalities, namely Caleb and Josiah and even the main character, Sarah! Changing the plot and characters so much just didn't make the story 'gel' together right. It came across that the only way to be a good christian is to be plain which is way off and anyway their was no mention of Christ anyway. I think one of the only saving graces the film had was little Bailee Madison who played Hannah- she was adorable."
3,Saving Sarah Cain,"A cute chick-flick to say the least,has moral lessons,not up to The Notebook Or Ultimate Gift (recommend both first for family viewing) as far as cinamatic content but a good family film just the same,sorry Michael Landon Jr."
5,Amazing movie,"this is one the best movies i've seen based by a book,it made me cry which when it comes tomovies it takes alot for me to do that.and i give 1000000000 thumbs up"
4,Saving Sarah Cain,Saving Sarah Cain is an inspirational story about a Young Women who learns that sometimes thinking of others is better than thinking about ones self. Definately a great family story.Kristy Ranker
1,Very Poor Adaptation of The Lewis Book,"Having read Beverly Lewis' book, ""Saving Sarah Cain"", I was deeply disappointed in the movie. From the very beginning the story line diverged from the book. The book explored the dynamic of Sarah Cain's arrival and acceptance of the ""plain"" lifestyle and her coming to understand the Amish people from living among them while struggling with the dilemma of what was to become of the children. I believe if the movie had followed the storyline of the book it would have been more compelling and certainly not as disappointing as the movie. If you have read and enjoyed the book as I did do not view the movie as you will most probably come away terribly dissatisfied."
1,Not authentic Amish and too schmaltzy,"I did many research papers on the Amish when I was in college. This movie is so far removed from the way the Amish really live, with the exception of an occasional Amish 'slang' word thrown in here and there for good measure. The accents were AWFUL, the mannerisms, the way of life, etc., were way off the true reality of the Plain Folk. I almost threw up when the boy said, 'We're not in Lancaster County anymore.' I could hear Dorothy's famous line, 'We're not in Kansas anymore.' It was a struggle just to finish watching."
5,Positive Sarah Cain,Heart warming with enough humor to keep it interesting. The acting was believable; casting was quite good. The children were very good in each of their roles.
4,saving sarah cain,A very good movie with a good moral. Very clean for the whole family. I only rated it a 4 because I reserve the rating 5 for my all time favorties. My husband and I watched it together and both really enjoyed it. I watched the movie before reading the ratings on Amazon and I definitely do not agree with the 1 star ratings nor the manner in which especially one of them was written.
5,Saving Sarah Cain DVD,I loved this movie. It had me laughing and crying. I am taking a group on a bus trip to Amish Country in April and plan to play it on the bus.
1,Disappointed - not at all like the book,"I have read all of Beverly Lewis' books. The Redemption of Sarah Cain was my least favorite, but still an enjoyable book. There was not much similarity comparing the movie to the book. In the book Sarah is redeemed from spending time among her nieces and nephews and the other amish by living in Lancaster Co with them. She is struck by the way they live, their simple ways and their complete trust in God's divive providence and this is how she comes to terms with something horrible that happened in her past. I understand there may be issues with the amount of time in a typical movie, but there is so much departure from the book that it should not even be associated with it. I may have liked it better had I never read the book. I was looking forward to some of Lewis' characters come to life, but there were too many inconsistencies and omissions. Hollywood again falls short of my imagination."
3,Lacks the depth of the fabulous books,"The movie, Saving Sarah Cain, lacks the depth and amazing development of the books that Beverly Lewis is so well known & loved for. The story is fine, but is lacking in so much - seems they could've added a good half-hour of character development into the movie at least. Also would've loved to see more in the Amish community."
4,"Family Friendly Movie, no blockbuster though","We visited Amish country this year on vacation. I thought this would be a good movie for my son to watch to see what it would be like to be Amish since he doesn't fully understand. It also came recommended along with Beverly Lewis books. It was a very wholesome movie, enjoyable. But the acting wasn't as great. I did enjoy the story line, wouldn't mind seeing other movies as well."
2,Not good enough.,"This is a solid title, but it is really not good enough. There is much better competition, which makes buying this game a really dumb move."
2,poorly edited,"Because there are so many grammatical errors in this book, it is difficult to read. In order to make sense of the book, I often had to read sentences aloud. I should not have to work that hard to read a book."
4,"Sparks fly, then go out....","The book was good in the beginning with the seduction and intrigue, but then it got a little boring toward the end. I will continue to read Alison Kent's books, although this one was good, it was not exceptional. I can't wait for Tripp's story in November."
3,"ALIAS this book is not, however....","I bought this book because the premise reminded me of something I would see on an episode of Alias, one of my favorite television shows. What I did not realize, being that I am not familiar with any of Kent's previous works, was that while Alison Kent is trying to do something different here by writing a novel about spies, she is first and foremost a romance writer. I am not a huge fan of such graphic romances (it is just not my taste) however, despite that I did enjoy the story of sexy spy Christian Bane and the strong willed Natasha Gaudet. The beginning of the book was pure romance so it took me a while to get into it but once it got going I found it hard to put down. This is definitely the beginning of a very interesting series, 3 Stars!"
5,The Bane Affair,I loved and really enjoyed reading this book. So much so that I am looking forward to reading the whole series.
5,Ashkenazy at his BEST!,"I have the original version of this set which stretched out to 12 CDs when it was first issued in 1989. The luster has absolutely NOT worn off of these performances! His version of the 20th is THE best version of that work I have ever heard - and that is saying quite a bit, as it is one of my favorite pieces of all time. Ashkenazy has thoroughly thought through how to infuse each work with musicianship and elegance. He is forceful when required and delicate when need-be. As good as Perahia's is, this is definitely the better set - get it and you will not be disappointed."
3,Music 5 Stars/Ashkenazy 3 Stars,"Sorry but from listening to the 1 minute clip of the final movement pc 21, I have to go with Uchida, who in my opinion is the master of Mozart's last 8 pc;s.I do not care for uchida's recordings of the 1-19, too thick handed for the style of those concertos.Quick, nimble, playful was not present in Uchida of the 1-19.Ashkenazy here is too busy with conducting to get the piano down with perfect nuances, which Mozart demands.EDIT, I've just added to more clip r4eviews , opening move 21 and opening from the 24th pc. Reconfirms my opinuion that Uchida is much better articulated. And though Tate is aweful in the syms , in the pc's he's much more on to of things concentrating in conducting. Ashkenazy is juggling both, successful at times I'll admit. At other times sloppy. Its impossible for any performer to both conduct and play paino. Impossible as this set shows.Nice Day"
5,Charming Mozart quality performances!,"Vladimir Ashkenazy and the Philiharmonia Orchestra have really mastered Mozart's piano concertos. Piano Concertos No. 20, 21, and 22 shine the most in this wonderful set with Mozart brilliance. I never realized the Philharmonia Orchestra was so capable of being such a good instrument to Mozart's work. Each work of art has that Mozart humor and quality that makes Mozart Mozart. And you have to owe it to London/Decca for remastering the sound quality of most of these performances. I can't really reccomend any other Mozart Piano Concertos set besides this. This one takes the cake."
4,good reading,"my husband now has the full series and he is enjoying them very much, he reads a lot and is realy liking this series."
3,Quiet but does not spin as fast as some other fans,"Unfortunately I did not do research as to the RPM of the fan. I was disappointed that the highest speed of this fan matched the middle speed of my previous fan. However, it seems to do an adequate job of cooling. (Frankly, I rarely kept my previous fan on at the highest speed anyway as it was almost too fast and it made me a little nervous. But still, it's nice to have that option for the few times you need that extra burst of air.)On the positive side, it is a very quiet fan.Hunter is also excellent at customer relations, which is another big plus when deciding to buy fans. I have other Hunter fans in my house and they are very good for the value."
5,Good Quiet Fan!!,We received the fan and my husband put it up. It is quiet and elegant. We plan on buying another one. Good product.
4,Great fan. Don't use the rubber grommets by ceiling.,"The only bad thing about this fan is I used the rubber grommets to mount the piece of metal that you screw into the ceiling. The grommets are supposed to reduce noise. However I now have about a inch gap between the cover and the ceiling. It would look better if I didn't use the grommets, though I don't know if I'd be able to hear a vibration.This thing moves a lot of air.I bought a Hunter remote control kit from the big blue home improvement retailer. Works great.I also bought a light kit there too. 2 60 watt candelabras. Looks great and works great.The only sound you hear is the sound of the air. Even on high."
5,Great Fan,"I bought a cheaper harbor breeze fan first installed and removed in same day. Ordered this one because I did not need a light it can be installed on this model. Far superior, designed to be quiet and it is at full and all other speeds. Highly recomend this product!"
3,doesn't hug ceiling,"I bought 2 of these fans - home depot carries them for $139 each so I bought them on amazon.They were installed today - look nice but they do not ""hug"" the ceiling. There is about a 1/4"" gap between the fan base and the ceiling which looks a little strange.I would advise if someone doesn't want that gap to buy another brand."
2,Unexpectedly cheap,"I purchased this fan thinking I was going to get a great deal on an good fan. I saw it priced at other places for around 125-150 and thought that this was too good of a deal to let slip. When I got the fan I was utterly disappointed. The mounting hardware is really cheap and the fan does not feel very secure in the mounting bracket. There is a 3/4 inch gap around the base when you choose flush mount. This will be the last Hunter fan I ever buy. I used to think they were a good brand, but I guess they have been going downhill lately."
3,not all products are equal,"I was sold on the brand, Hunter, after owning a couple of them. This model, however, is not as whisper quiet as my previous Hunter ceiling fans have been.Once everything is out of the box and installed in the ceiling, the customer is not likely to return it. I wish I had bought it through a big box store."
5,What a excellent fan!!!!,"Very quiet, very smooth operating fan, Easy to install as long as you read the instruction!!!! Very cost effective was able to turn my thermostat 5 degrees and still kept house very comfortable. highly recommend it!!!"
4,Hunter Ceiling Fan,"I would have rated this a 5 star except for the fact that we had to wait over 2 weeks for Hunter to send hardware that was missing. Their customer service leaves a lot to be desired, once you get through to a human. we also e-mailed them. Once the hardware was received and installed, we have no complaints with this fan. It's quiet, runs smoothly, does the job, and the price was very good. We are very pleased with this product and would definitely recommend it."
5,Great Fan...No noise.,This is our second fan in this style and we'll probably get another. Simple to install and moves alot of air.
5,I Love it!,"Easy to install and works great. Just what I was looking for in a hugger fan, great quality for the money."
2,Beware - It has an extremely large base,"the base of this fan is extremely large. The fan is designed to mount flush to the ceiling, and it does this with no problem, but just be aware that the base is extremely large, so it is more noticeable than I would have liked. It's also not as quiet as I would have expected from a Hunter fan and I know I'm not using a dimmer or anything that would cause extra noise, so it's just something to be aware of before purchasing.Other than that, the fan does function properly, so that's good."
5,Attractive and functional,"We bought two of these for our office and they are simply attractive, run so quietly we forget it's on, and move the air quite well on three speeds. Although not mentioned anywhere in the literature, they are wired to accept a light kit. We purchased a Hunter light kit for one of the fans, and it works perfectly."
5,Very Quiet Fan,I had always heard Hunter fans were the quietest but didn't believe there could be that much of a difference between brands - I was wrong. This fan makes absolutely no noise. We installed this fan in a bedroom so we wanted to make sure it was as quiet as possible and this one did the job. I expect other Hunter fans are the same way.
4,powerful & low profile,"I love this fan! We have a tri-level home, so I really needed a fan that did not sit too low from the ceiling. This one is great! We have a swap cooler (no AC) and this cools down the room significantly! My only complaint is that it is not white like it says. It is more of an off-white."
4,SPT SD-30E 30-Pint Dehumidifier,"I have had the dehumidifier running in my boat for about a month now, and it works great. The boat is much drier. Who would of thought that there was that much mosetur in the air. I have had to empty it a number of times. And I have emptied it when I was going sailing and put it somewhere so it wouldn't fall over. The feature that lets you select the humidity that you want, and the feature that lets you chose to have the dehumidifier run continiously are both great features and work well. Some times the sound of the air moving is annoying, but that is how it works. If it didn't move as much air it wouldn't work as well."
1,"very loud, unusable","This is like the loudest cheap motel air conditioner sound I've ever heard. On top of that, it vibrates. My downstairs neighbors would kill me if I kept this thing. Not to mention the fact that I would never be able to sleep through that racket.I can't comment on its ability to dry the air--I can't keep it on long enough. It's going back tomorrow."
4,Good buy,The SPT 30 pint dehumidifier is a good buy and I recommend it to anyone wanting an average sized dehumidifier.
2,Poor quality CD,"I have heard this CD in its entirety through Rhapsody music. The production quality is poor, the sound muffled, the mix bad, and the vocals poorly done. This CD is NOT a quality recording, contrasted to the higher quality recent major releases by Pillar. The content is good, and the lyrics have a personal, real depth which is why I gave it 2 stars and not 1 star.I was SHOCKED at how poor the vocals were on this album. On slower songs like Beautiful Savior, an awesome song is wasted by a poor vocal performance. This album is not, in my opinion, listenable, and you'd be better off buying a newer Pillar CD."
2,Another hack job,"I've now read several of the books in the ""Complete Story"" series, and they seem to be typified by indifferent writing quality, a very heavy UK slant, insane chapter ordering, and a general sense that they were tossed off in a weekend by a third-tier writer. This book has way too much focus on racing, not enough on the cars, and not enough on the M organization. Unfortunately, though, English-language BMW M info is slim, and this book isn't much worse than the rest of what's available. Go ahead and buy it if you're desperate."
3,Its alright..,"This cymbal looks great. The sound is decent however. the decay is very very fast and for a cymbal, its a bit quiet. But i am pleased with this. This cymbal is very durable and i beat the hell out of my cymbals."
1,Doesn't work,"Like the other reviewers, this wouldn't work on my computer. The box clearly states that it will work on Vista, but when I go to install it, it gives me an error that states that one of the files isn't ""compatible with 64 bit Windows"". I can't follow the other reviewers instructions, because it won't let me get any further than the error message. Stinks, because the kids were really looking forward to playing this one."
4,Liked it enough to track it down again 15 years later,"The other reviewer has done a great job of summarizing the book and recommending it. I'll just add that I read this book originally about 15 years ago, and I had such fond memories of it that I wracked my brain to come up with the title and hunted around to find a copy. It held up pretty well to my nostalgia. There's a fun mystery plot that provides a very nice vehicle for the romance that grows between the H/h."
5,Great guitar playing and song writing,"Jim Mac is the players player:Great composition and song structure, cool changes,top notch players around him and jazz tinged guitar solos. If you dig funky, jazzy, rock hybrids, this is for you. Smart writing and cool playing, that's Jimmy Mac!"
2,"EMI's ""Klemperer Legacy -Wagner"" is Much Better","I enjoyed the EMI Classics 2 cd set conducted by Otto Klemperer far more than this rather disappointing recording with James Levine. Klemperer's conducting is more subtle and expressive, capturing far more detail and emotional depth. In contrast Levine's conducting really makes the music feel ""always on"" - always going at full bore and therefore the music loses it's power and the contrast between tragedy and heroic, desperate bliss that Wagner's music embodies. Get the Klemperer instead. It actually brings real legitimacy to the orchestral-only performance."
4,Not Bad For A Budget Album,"When I picked this up in a local drugstore's discount bin, I really did'nt know whether I would like it. But when I put it in , I was happy to discover that these were the original songs, not cheap, shoddy versions that sound nothing like the original. Some of the best 80's metal is here, like Slaughter's Up All Night, and WASP's LOVE Machine. Probably the best song on the album is the underground classic, I Love The Things You Do To Me, by the un-heard of Balaam And The Angel."
1,Yet another New Historian spin,"Anti-Zionist 'new historian' Segev is at it again. This time he claims the British actually favored the Zionists during the inter-war period. After that, the Jews are basically a side show, in the struggle between the Arabs and British. To be brief, Prof. Yehoshua Porath of Hebrew University, absolutely rips apart this book in the spring, 2000 issue of Azure. Porath details Segev's half-truths, mistruths, ignorance of key events and meetings, and an overall mischaracterization of the Mandate period to fit Segev's 'new historian' anti-zionist agenda. The reader should know all the facts, not just through Segev's biased lens."
4,New look at Palestinians and Israelis,"Although Segev does not touch on the recent turbulence in the Mid-East, it all seems relevant. We've become accustomed to one view of Israel's history, and he shows us a new perspective. Most people believe that Israel would not have gained statehood without the Holocaust, but Segev points out that a move toward this was well on its way well before this, and that the Holocaust was actually a setback, depriving Israel of the settlers it needed to establish itself. He also has great, gossipy stories so that it's a surprisingly fast read, despite the heft of the book."
3,"Mysterious Author, Worth Reading!","Is Tom Segev the Oliver Stone of Israel? He has always a unique, original but somehow doubtful (to my mind) take on the events of our country's past. Sometimes I think he's a genius storyteller. Other times, I have to wonder if he isn't just trying to get a new vision going, whatever the price to reality. Either way, he's definitely working through a truly unique mind. Whether he's writing fiction or non-fiction--that little matter isn't yet clear to me."
1,A crude attempt at revising facts to suit politics,"This was one of the worst-written books I have read on Israel. Segev seems to take inordinate joy in character assassination regarding anyone who may be an exception to his politics. The hopelessly inaccurate information he gives regarding Orde Wingate, the brilliant British military commander, and ardent Zionist and friend of the Jews is a case in point. Since Segev attempts to paint the British in general as pro-Israeli, he must perforce cast the aruably greatest friend the Jews had during the Mandatory years. On the whole, a very questionable piece of pseudo-scholarship that I would advise against wasting time on. Good only as a reference on how distorting this new breed of 'revisionist' historian is."
4,Journalistic in style,"If you've ever wanted to know the historical background of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict then this book is a great introduction. Those who expect academic prose and terms will be disappointed; it is journalistic in tone and meant to entertain more than critique and analyze. Data are surreptitiously woven into poetic phrases, and delivered in storied manner. Good read otherwise."
5,GREAT BUY GREAT PRODUCT,"These hole punches work awesome. Well worth the price. The plastic box is just fine. Same as youd find in any hardware store selling the same product. If you want better make your own. I used these to cut holes for grommets in the Sumpreme Moving quilts. Intially I started using a rubber mallet for hammering the punches (just because I saw online demonstrations using one) this is a mistake! You dont get enough force and the end result is the tools not cutting a hole easily. Use a metal hammer both for the punches and when setting the grommets. The people commenting that these punches arent sharp enough, probably were using a rubber mallet. As it makes the punches seem dull. After switching to a metal hammer it was like night and day. Great buy, great product. PURCHASE."
2,Dull and Disappointing,"The price was right but the sharpness was not. These are remarkably dull. Might be OK for cutting something soft (foam?) but won't cut a clean hole on most materials, thick fabric, etc. Disappointing they are so dull as they are finished nicely."
5,"Work awesome, great deal","Great bargain. They work great and go through thicker leather easily. I use them to make dog collars, bracelets and belts. The variety of sizes is more than enough for every job, and they leave a nice clean hole. I found a rotatory hand punch didn't go strait through the leather, but at an angle, which made it hard to line up holes when going though multipliable layers of leather. These work much better. Recommended."
5,"a lot of value, and a decent set","I had tried another set, and they were junk. So, I figured for the 10 bucks, I couldn't go wrong. Well, I'm pleasantly surprised. Pretty durable, decent quality. I've been pretty rough on them, and they're still in decent shape. Go for it, it's really a great deal."
3,Your Child Will Go Deaf !!!,"I can't believe they added music to this loveable toy! As a new grandparent, I was excited to see this stocked in the store. That is, until I picked it up and heard the loudest annoying ""music"" coming from it. It's great--if your child is deaf, if not, they soon will be with this toy by their side! I had one of these as a child, and have bought them for my own kids and nieces and nephews. No more! There are enough toys out there that make noise, the simplicity of this nice, quiet toy is what made it great. What were they thinking???"
5,Love this toy,"My family loves this toy, we own two of them since it is so wonderful. It is not loud but not quiet either. It could play the music a little longer but it is still soothing to listen to. It is also fun to play with while not trying to nap, a sleep aid is not it's only purpose. Good parenting and a comfortable surrounding help some children to sleep more than a lullaby toy. Perhaps sing to your child or read them a story, you can't expect to just put them in a bed with a toy and walk away to make your life more simple. Some children are easier than others, don't blame the toy."
4,cute one,It's a cute toy and I have seen a lot of small girls just stickin to it all the time and especailly at bedtime...music is soft and the face cute...i'm sure all tiny tots will love it as their bedtime toy...
3,My son loves it but it doesn't play long at all....,"My son absolutely loves his gloworm only problem is no matter what I do it plays songs for 30 seconds tops and it usually never makes it that long. We've switched the button over to play mode, followed the instructions they give if it's not functioning properly to remove the batteries and reinsert, tried new batteries and it still doesn't work. We ended up buying the Ocean Wonder's Soothe & Glow Sea Horse which he likes just as much. I also was told by Hasbro today they will be sending me another gloworm because they believe mine is defective. So hopefully I'll be able to update my review later on."
4,Sleep friend,"I got this for my just turned 1 year old. The only problem I have with it is when you press the button (by the way she can do it without any trouble), the light goes off before the song ends and you have to wait for the song to end before turning the light back on. I also have a 5 year old son who has been rough on it, and it is still going strong!!"
5,Two grandkids and counting,"My daughter received this as a gift prior to the birth of my grandson. He loved it. In fact, it was difficult to get him to go to sleep without it until he was about 18 months old, when he moved on to other toys. My daughter then gave it to her sister's new baby, who, at 16 months still loves it. I just ordered another one for my newest granddaughter, who is 4 months old.One of the best baby toys I have seen."
4,good toy,"i bought this toy for my daughter when she was 4 mos. she loves it! although it hasn't been much help getting her to go to sleep, she loves to smile at it, and is absolutely delighted when she makes it light up and sing. she loves music, and this toy has been very effective for getting her to smile for pictures, or getting her to calm down when she is upset. it is very durable, i have had no problems with the paint, or anything, and now that my daughter is teething, she chews on it all the time. the batteries ran out rather quickly, but don't they always? overall, this toy is worth the $10."
3,"Nice toy for the crib, but a little hard for comfort","My daughter received this as a gift and she loves to squeeze the GloWorm to play songs, but doesn't like to cuddle it as it isn't exactly soft enough for cuddling. The music is a little loud, and doesn't play for very long."
4,Adorable light-up toy,"My mother-in-law gave this toy to me for a shower gift, I use it in my 2 month old daughter's crib to help her relax and fall asleep. She doesn't really mind it though she likes toys that she can interact with on her own, especially toys that turn on when moves or cries. I think that any child that likes toys with lights and music will like this toy."
5,My son loves it and I love it!,He is very interested in looking at it's face and he gets so excited when it lights up. He loves the music! It has put him to sleep many times and it always keeps him happy when he's awake. It's a great thing to have in the car at night because he doesn't like not being able to see. I was a little disapointed at first because the music didn't play for very long but then I opened it up and realized it was just on the demo setting. I also love that it's machine washable because many of his other toys aren't and it never seems like they get clean enough. I would definetly recommend this toy. You get a lot at a great price!
3,Annoying Music!,"My daughter LOVES the glow worm. Her face just lights up everytime the worms face lights up. However, the music is not soft and soothing. It really is loud and VERY annoying. We fixed this by opening up and cutting the speaker cord! Now it just lights up and my daughter still enjoys it. They really needed to make an off switch for the music."
2,Too Loud!!!,"I bought this for my 9 month old daughter, because I loved the traditional glow-worm. She likes it, yet cannot take it to bed. It is too sensitive to touch and much to loud. She moves in her sleep and it comes on, startling her and making her cry.I bought it so it could be a night-time companion (too bad). I really wish there was a way to turn off the music."
1,Horrible,"What a horrible and loud toy. My brother had a glow warm when he was young. What a wonderful, soft, and soothing toy. Not this one. The music is so loud that it makes my baby cry and makes me want to scream. Unfortunately, we have two of these ""lovely"" toys."
5,A fun first toy,"My 6 week old daughter loves this toy. The music is a bit loud, we solved that by putting a couple of pieces of electrical tape over the speakers. Also, if you don't take it out of demo mode, the songs are way too short. It's an easy adjustment to make, though."
1,Not like the one I had...,"I was unimpressed by this toy when we bought it for our baby boy. The paint on the vinyl face rubbed off within a week and he cried at the LOUD music. I was concerned about damage to my son's hearing this thing is so loud! Weren't our glow worms more soothing? If you're looking for something to lull your baby to sleep, I suggest Baby Tad (my son's favorite), the Ocean Wonders Aquarium, or another toy."
3,Ok but not very long on the light....,"We got this to help our two year old to have something she could light up at night when she woke up. This was good for that because we could turn the music off (although she turned it over and opened it up in the first 10 minutes and figured it out...) but the light only lasts for 30 seconds. She spends her time pushing it over and over instead of sleeping. It would be much better if it lasted for 5-10 minutes. The packaging didn't say how long it lasted and if I had known it was that short we would have looked for something else. The other choice lasted for 5 minutes but was light and music. With our munchkin co-sleeping with us, I didn't want the music wake up in the middle of the night."
4,My kids enjoy their Glowies!,"My twins were given gloworms this Christmas. They love their glowies. The face is soft, the body is huggable, it's easy for their little hands to hold and love. The only complaint I have is that after just a few weeks use- we brought the glowies up to bed after the new year (we'd forgotten them at Grandma's!) the batteries are all ready dying. It's kind of a pain to dig the battery compartment out of the body.As for the volume level, if you still feel it's to loud even on the lesser setting, try taping a piece of cloth over the speaker. Lots of kids toys are ridiculously loud, putting tape over the speaker has helped in our house!"
4,Glo-ee - We Love It!,"My daughter loves the Gloworm. I like the fact that it is small enough for my 11 month old to hold herself. It seems smaller than the older Gloworm that I remember. Sadie loves the light and the music. She has finally figured out how to turn the music on by herself. It is so cute to see her get so excited when Glo-ee shows up. She hugs the doll so tightly.It is nice that the toy has different switches - one for the light by itself and one for both lights and music. I wish there was just an on/off switch because, when the batteries start running out, the worm makes weird sounds!I also like the fact that the inside mechanism can be removed and the doll itself can be washed - even in the machine, which I consider a bonus.My only criticism would be that the toy is very draining on batteries. We are on our third set in less than a month, and that includes cheap as well as expensive batteries."
4,Its all right,I got this as a gift and it is all right. I would have liked to have the orginal one. This toy is exetermly sensitive to playing music. I do wish it would play a whole song and not half of the song. My 10month daughter is not to thrilled with it keeps her attention for a few mintues. I have not used it for a bed time toy because it is to loud for bed time.hope this helps
5,my baby LOVES her gloworm,"My daughter is almost 3 months old and just loves her gloworm. It's the only toy that will make her smile (real big!), Laugh and talk to her gloworm. It is the most adorable thing. I had one when I was little and her aunt had one as well. All babies should have their very own gloworm. The only thing I'd like better about it is if played it's songs longer.~Theresa 21~"
3,Good Toy,We brought this for our daughter who isn't even a month old yet and she loves it. If she gets fussy all we have to do is squeeze it and her eyes widen and she just watches it. The only bad thing is that it doesn't play the songs for very long before it shuts off and you have to squeeze it again.
4,Great for bedtime,"My son received this toy as a Christmas gift when he was 2 1/2 months old. He LOVED it right from the beginning! Whenever he would get really fussy, we would play it and he would immediately calm down and just stare at the big eyes of the gloworm. My only complaint is that there is no volume and when we accidently hit it it would start playing pretty loudly and wake him up. But he would smile and close his eyes again."
1,I can't hear anymore after this toy!,"The Gloworm is ok, but do yourself a favor and open that sucker up and disconnect the sound. I received this as a gift from my mother-in-law after she was told this toy was too loud and would wake my daughter up at night if she rolled onto it. My daughter is now 16 months old and doesn't touch the thing at all. It stays wedged up against the side of the crib so it looks like this is going out for a garage sale soon."
1,Please beware,"I bought this toy for my one year old niece. We were looking for toys to help her learn to comfort herself and go back to sleep on her own. We were hoping for a toy that played soft, soothing music and gently glowed. However, that is not what this toy does. The ""songs"" are so loud they can be heard over all noise in a busy room (tv, talking, ringing phone, etc.) and in a quiet room it was so loud the noise made ME jump. Also, the toy is very heavy and the hard plastic center that houses the music device can be felt easily through the padding. My glowworm did not come with a book, either, even though the picture indicated it did. I have written Hasbro about the quality of this product and I hope that if you want a nap time or bedtime toy for your child you will buy the vintage version instead. Some things don't need ""improving""."
5,Great for Bedtime,"My daughter loves this toy. She has to have her gloworm sing her a song everynight, and loves to cuddle him while she winds down. A note to the previous reviewer - take the gloworm off of ""Demo"" mode (you have to take out the battery pack inside the gloworm), and you will get longer songs and lights."
2,TOO LOUD!,I bought this to soothe my 3 month old to sleep but the music is very loud and annoying. It startles my child instead of calming her down at bedtime. I can't understand why Hasbro would make the music play so loud. What were they thinking!?
2,Let your baby see it before you buy it!,"I grew up with my own precious gloworm, which I absolutely adored, and was thrilled to see this online! We purchased it, but should have waited to see it in person before doing so. My daughter is 4 months, and does not like it at all. The ""glow"" is quite bright and the ""lulubies"" are rather loud. We were able to hear the music clearly on the other side of our home - much too loud for us. However, my older toddler did seem to like it, but I still returned it because I did not think I could stand hearing the music over and over again (which is what toddlers do!) So, if you are looking to purchase this for an older toddler/child, it could be good - if you are buying it for a baby, let the baby see it first --- it was much to loud and bright for our tenderhearted little one..."
2,"My son liked it, but PVC - yuck!","My inlaws bought us the gloworm, which my son enjoyed briefly, but then we discovered that the face was made of PVC (polyvinyl chloride), which often contains toxic additives (such as lead and phthalates). So we got rid of it.To the parents who said it is too loud, it does have two volume settings. We found the lower volume to be more or less reasonable, but yeah, the higher volume is WAY too loud to sit next to a baby's head!"
3,Not the same,The gloworm I got wasn't the same as in the picture. The one I got has a night cap that is tied in knots on both sides and doesn't have a star on it. The patch on its belly is different too.. though that doesn't really matter.I was upset to see that the face doesn't light up very long at all. It only lights up for about 4 seconds.The music is quite loud but it doesn't bother me.
3,Not That Great,"This toy is very cute and plays nice music that wouldn't annoy adults, but it doesn't play nearly long enough even on the long play mode. Your baby would never get calmed down or fall asleep in this short amount of time. My recommendation is the Fisher-Price Soothe and Glow Seahorse because it is the same basic thing but has a very long playing time."
4,Our little one loves this toy! Highly recommended,Our 8 month old little girl received this for Christmas and absolutely loves it. She loves giving it a good squeeze and watching it light up. This was one of her favorite gifts.
3,A little too loud,"I recently bought this for my son who has a difficult time going to sleep. I thought maybe it would be calming if he had something in the crib with him that lit up. However, in a quiet house, in the middle of the night, it is very loud. We have to take it out of the crib because if he rolls over on it, it wakes him up!!!! I wish they still offered the first gloworm that didn't make any noise! On a positive note, he does enjoy playing with it during the day."
3,"Too loud for bed, good for dolly","My 2 yo has had this toy since birth. She still plays with it, enjoying the music more and more each time. However, I have never been able to use it as a crib toy, as it is just TOOOO loud. There must be a way for them to improve this toy with a volume control in the back. It is also too hard for an infant to roll over onto-from the battery/music pack inside it. It's not the face or the material that's hard. I recommend this toy, if you aren't planning on using it in a crib setting. Otherwise, I would opt for a different musical toy."
2,doesn't play long enough.,This only lights up and plays for about 30 seconds; then you have to push the patch on its stomach to play it again; so it's not really good for bedtime and getting the little one to sleep.
3,Did not get what I paid for,"I ordered a lullaby gloworm, description ""with a purple shirt with an embroidered moom and a star attached to the hat""(also pictured this way). I received a gloworm with a blue shirt embroidered with a moon and star and a hat that has a knot on both sides(I already have this gloworm). I needed two different gloworms so my girls could tell them apart. :("
2,not all have volume control!,"Yes, this toy is loud. Very LOUD! I have read several reviews that mention, and even tell you how to find, the volume control. However, mine does not have one. The white cylinder inside has two positions, ""play"" and ""demo"".It was a gift from my grandma to my infant in December 2004, so maybe the ""new gloworm"" was not available yet. Mine looks identical to the ones pictured here, though.My solution: I removed the cylinder with the batteries. It no longer glows or sings, but it's soft, cuddly, cute to look at, and easy to chew on. Problem solved."
5,My Daughter's Favorite,"I recieved this toy as a baby shower gift and thought that it was adorable. It was the first toy that my daughter really got attached to. She is now 7 months old and does not want to be separated from it. The music a little loud, but not so much that it bothers me or my husband. It's a great comfort toy and I have given it as a gift on three occasions since recieving mine."
1,Scared 2 yr old who isnt afraid of the dark,"Parents I don't know if you remember the old gloworms- They were great. So I decided to get one for my son, well that was a big mistake. He loves the gloworm as long as it doesn't play loud annoying same song music or light up. He cries everytime he accidently steps on it or hugs it. I eventually had to give it to my neice who is 4.What is so weird is that my son isn't afraid of anything. He runs into dark rooms before I can manage to get the light on and on halloween he walked right up to a Jason look alike and laughed. I think he is afraid because our faces don't light up like the gloworms does."
3,Gloworm Review,"My baby loves how the face of the gloworm glows in the dark. He just stares at it, while smiling. I wish that it was easier for him to start the music and glowing face, but it is entertaining to him anyway. It is a great way to let him know that it is time for bed."
2,Gloworm not the one pictured,"Playskool came out with a new Gloworm in 2006. The one pictured and described here (with the star on the cap) is the 2003 model. I much prefer the 2003 and expected it when I ordered 4 of these. Since I got the 2006 instead, I sent them back.The main difference between the two is how easy they are to activate. The 2003 one easily plays a lullaby and lights up when squeezed virtually anywhere, but the 2006 model has a patch on the tummy that the child has to press to hear a tune and get the face to glow. That's fine for 8 months and up (and not in the middle of the night), but the other one is more user friendly for all ages.Unfortunately, the 2003 model is unavailable everywhere. I am just writing to let everybody know that [...]does not have the 2003 model either."
2,no song no lite,My daughters aunt bought her the glow worm and when we got it home and from there on out and battery's after battery's it would not play the melody all the way through. I think if they make a musical toy it should be where it plays the whole melody and not part of it. We were constantly pushing the belly to get it to play more and it made my 1 1/2 year old very irritated. other than that it is a great stuffed animal and the glow part of it worked great.
2,Not as good as the original,I bought this for my infant and it only plays the 1st line of any of 3 songs. It lights up for longer than it plays music for. The nice thing is it doesn't take much to set it off. My 9 month old can do it fine.
4,Life Saver,"We got this toy for our 21month old daughter for the 2003 Christmas season as a Christmas present from Santa. It has been attached to my daughters hip ever since. To her it is her ""Baby"". She has all the tunes memorized and I credit this toy for inspiring my daughter to sing along. Now, she sings along to all the songs and must got to bed with it every night. I love that the worm glows for the entire length of the song. When I had one as a child it only glowed if you hugged it and stopped glowing soon as you let go. I definately would not only recommend this to anyone but by it as a gift as well."
2,Fisher Price's Seahorse is better...,"I have this glow worm and the seahorse by fisher price. Both are essentially the same thing - lullabies and lights. Well, my 5 month old and I are not fans of the glow worm as the music is loud for babies trying to sleep (even NOT in the 'demo' mode) and the music is so short! I had to sit right next to her (as she can't turn it on herself) and constantly keep doing it for her. The seahorse plays much longer and is more soothing sounding - puts her right out."
1,Old vs. New,What was worng with the old Glowworm? My son loved it. He is 4 now & really misses his 'glowbaby' as he calls it. The old one was so soft and cuddley. In his 4yrs he has worn out about 6 of them. We can no longer find the old style & he hates the new one. He still sleeps with the old one even tho it is worn out. I wish we could find 1 of the older ones. All it did was light up with no music and for a child that does not like loud nosie it was great. Somethings should be left alone.
4,My son loves this toy!,"I bought this for my 5 month old for Christmas and he just loves it. It is so sensitive that he can easily make it light up and play the music on his own. I read the reviews about the music being loud and I am inclined to agree that it may be a bit on the loud side but it makes my son giggle so much when he hears the music play, that I cannot complain. He does hit it in the middle of the night and the music over the monitor wakes us up but never seems to disturb him. The music is a nice improvement on this toy but if I could add a constructive comment, it might be a good idea for Hasbro to make the toy with a feature that allows the sound to be turned off by a switch so that it just glows at those times when the music is not wanted."
1,Boooooooooooooooooo!,"Ok, leave it to Playskool to ruin a perfectly good thing. I ordered two of these for my children because they both have 'issues' with the dark. When they arrived I expected to see a cuddly little stuffed thing that lit up when hugged. Well, it not only lights up... it BLARES the WORST electronic 'lullabies' you can imagine! And you can't turn them off!!!! Now why would they do that on something that is intending to be a nighttime comforter? Ugh!!! I promptly packed them up and returned them, and found the old (quiet) version elsewhere online."
1,beware!,"I haven't purchased this toy, but read from a reader in Elgin, IL. who wrote a review that her husband fixed the noise level by placing scotch tape over the speakers.PLEASE, please don't do this! Very young children put everything in their mouths-- when my son was an infant, he almost choked to death on some scotch tape he was able to dislodge from a surface.If anyone knows who this reviewer was in Elgin, please contact her & alert her to the hazards. I'd hate to see anyone's precious child go through a choking incident like we did. I came so close to losing my son."
4,great toy,"My daughter loved the gloworm when she had it as a baby, so it is a go-to gift for all babies. Music light and a bit of soft fabric is a perfect combination for any 4 month old."
5,Wonderful take along toy,I bought this for my son who is 5 months old. I read the other reviews that it was too loud. Maybe I got a quiet one but I don't notice it to be too loud. He loves the light up face. The blanket did come off the hand but that was an easy fix. He is so entertained by it. He talks to it when it is telling a story. I LOVE it.
2,The Music is the Problem,"Cute, nostalgiac toy but the music is way too loud, and it also comes on too easily, with the lightest touch. I do not put it in the crib with my daughter because the music seems jarring in a quiet room. Her favorite blanket does the trick much better."
5,Happy Quilting,"Brother SA125 1/4 Inch Piecing FootBrother SA129 Quilting FootThese are a ""must have"" for quilting. They both work equally well. The SA125 is great when sewing thin fabrics and the SA129 is terrific for thicker fabrics or 2 layers of fabric with batting. They were priced well and arrived sooner than expected."
5,I Love This 1/4 Inch Piecing Foot,"One of the most important things you have to get right in quilting is a 1/4 inch seam. I have had problems with this so I was happy to see that my Brother CS6000i had a 1/4 inch piecing foot. It didn't come with the machine so I purchased it and I must say, this is really wonderful. It has this little runner on the side of the foot that helps you make a perfect 1/4 inch seam. I would recommend this foot for anyone who owns a Brother CS6000i. I am so happy with mine."
3,Ok but I found a better one,I ordered this foot to use to make quilts. It is ok but I found one I like better. Here is a link to it http://www.amazon.com/Brother-1-4-Inch-Quilting-Foot/dp/B001H61A6Y/ref=cm_cr-mr-title
1,1/4 Foot for Brother Sewing Machines,"This special foot does well at providing a 1/4 inch guide for the sewer. However, if you are crossing any seams on the left, the foot gets caught and flips up the seam. If the foot was tapered on the left side toward the front or turned up a bit, the problem may be prevented. I'll be using painter's tape to mark my 1/4 inch line and forget about this foot!"
1,Brother SA 129 and Brother SA125,I ordered these 2 presser feet from Amazon shipment was really fast recieved it second day I opened the package first of all they were not in original box then I opened the manual it is a copy of the manual I can barely read it I called the company Gold Star Tool the telephonist answered and she said give me your phone number somebody will call you bad customer service then I asked did you send me used presser feet she answered I don't know I will not order from them I bought b4 from Amazon presser feet and I recieved them in original box .
1,Did not get item ordered,"This was not the item I ordered but since I paid so little and postage was so much, I just discarded it and considered it my loss."
2,Broken Needles Inevitable,"This is sold as an adequate 1/4 inch quilting foot for my machine - the Brother CS-6000i.I loved this foot when I put it on my machine, and it does help create accurate 1/4 seems. Then I noticed the needle hole does not line up with the default needle placement of the machine. (Seems odd, no?) I said to myself, ""Self, remember to change the needle position IMMEDIATELY when you turn on your machine again."" Of course I didn't and the second time I went to use it, I ended up with a broken needle. To me, a foot that results in a broken needle if I don't remember to change my needle position each and every time I turn on my machine, is not a adequate foot for the machine.Look - this needle is great for quilting even 1/4 inch seems. But I doubt I'll use it too many more times. I don't want to buy needles every single time I forget to change my needle position before dropping it. I would love a foot that is made for the left-default needle position. Sadly, I can't find one..."
5,Good piecing foot.,"Fits my new Brothert machine perfectly, works well for piecing. It's good to know where I can get Brother sewing machine products."
2,Brother piecing foot,I should have saved my money. The guide is nothing special and I could have used the mark on my regular foot to do the same job. Not impressed.
5,Fits!,I thought this would not work but works great as if it belonged with the machine. I am very satisfied with this product and the timely arrival.
4,"Introspection, taciturn reflection and dark poetry!","To undertake the difficult task of recording the whole set of Scriabin ` s piano sonatas requires and demands from the soloist, a first-rate technique, a complete understanding of the incorporeal lexicon bellow the score, and being totally immersed in the universe, plenty of kaleidoscopic hues, and the whole gamut of the emotional frequencies of this introspective, genial and taciturn composer, who devoted almost his entire cycle for this instrument.Ashkenazy is a famed and talented performer, who was born with the gift to express with assertive eloquence the prism of felings, livings and perceptions that are nestled in his scores.This set must be included among the most relevant achievements of this pianist, as soon as one of the most prominent recordings of these sonatas."
2,Only if you have insomnia,"Ashkenazy ruins everything he touches. As in the case of his recording of Prokofiev's Second Piano Concerto, these perfomances are soooo sloooooow - totally tired and lifeless. But Scriabin's sonatas are anything but boring! I much prefer Micheal Ponti's VOX CDs. (Yes, the sound on them is horrible, but the performances are awesome!)"
