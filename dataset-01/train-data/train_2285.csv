1,plain silly,"Offensive, and I am not easily offended--would be O.K. if not a prime time show. Main character coarse and vulgar."
2,WARNING: adds no functionality,"This is just a fancy version of the adapter that already comes with your Creative Zen Vision. Which is fine, but not for this price!If you're buying this to be able to charge your player from a wall outlet, or to play media directly to the TV, this is not what you want. You need the separate AV cord and the separate DC charger. These will work directly with your Zen Vision's standard adapter, without needing this docking station.The only value this docking station adds is giving you an extra adapter, but in stand form. THAT'S IT."
1,Disappointing and overpriced,"This product doesn't include an AC adapter, and is so light I have to use both hands to remove the player. I think that this thing is worthless. I am pleased with the value of the Zen Vision, but I can't believe some of the corners they cut; it should have come with this chunk of plastic, rather than the silly chuck of plastic it did include. Most irksome."
4,Graphic SF Reader,"As Neil Gaiman takes over the writing duties from Alan Moore, the story leaps ahead in time. Miracleman's totalitarian utopia, if you will, is well established.He does end up entering into a dialogue with his former girlfriend about the politics of utopia, and whether this is good for humans in the long run.He and his colleagues have become far removed from the normal people."
5,"Movie ""The Women""","This is such a good movie. Thoroughly entertaining! Meg Ryan is great as always, and Annette Benning is outstanding. Funny and just a great movie!"
5,i love it,"I already love the movie because it has Jada Pinkett in it and she is my favorite, although she is not seen throughtout the movie like the other cast members. This movie is a type of laid back movie that anyone can watch. It's not soft enough to be considered a chick flick, and certainly not hard enough to the point where all the boyz want to go and see it. I love the movie. It's comedy sure enough...I bought it used through Amazon and it arrived in 4 days of my ordering it."
3,literally no male actors in this?,"So this comedy carries a chick flick to the feminist end:there are actually no male actors. We only see the men as reflectedin their effects on the lives of the women.You think that the friends are going to attackthe other woman at her perfume counter.Solidarity breaks down when the magazine editors confirmsthe break up to a gossip columnist.The lesbian played by Jada Pinkett Smith is an accepted one of the friendsso that moral or religious superiority is also lostby these defenders of the middle class womanhood.I'm a long time Meg Ryan fan, so I enjoyed the movie,but I can't say this is a high point for western culture."
3,"Worth the watch, but don't expect miracles.","A ""feel good"" film, definately a chick flick. The value of friendship is the central message. The actresses are top notch, but some of the dialogue comes across as very fake. It's a common theme done to death. The title is somewhat a giveaway. It is enjoyable for a casual watch."
2,Doesn't Quite Make It,"I saw the original film recently, of which this is a remake, and I have to say that it's way better than this, to the extent that I can't see why they bothered to make this. This version pays lip service to every issue contemporary women have to contend with, but the whole thing comes off as disengenuous. What it does portray is that every actress in this movie has had work done and it shows! The only person who distinguishes herself, acting wise and appearance wise (because she looks authentic) is Annette Benning. I can't remember a time when I've seen her in a film when she doesn't do a great job. This might be worth getting just to see her act. Overall, I wanted to like this but I was disappointed."
1,My Vote for Worst of 2008,"I really want to simply state the experience of this film:Night out with women film. NO one was looking for a GREAT movie, just to laugh a bit and be entertained.then..We just stared at the screen, all 9 of us, with that weird ""wow this is still not funny"" frozen smile - like when old uncle Charlie tells that same old joke at holiday time, you know, THAT smile."
1,Wanted to vomit!,Politely sat through the film for the sake of others. The fashion show with the simultaneous birth was over the top and made the film that much more stupid. Jada Pinkett Smith doesn't play a convincing lesbian either
1,How bad can bad be.....,"There is bad and then there is really bad and the there is the remake of The Women which adds a new low to bad. A great cast wasted on a really bad script. How can one of the funniest plays in B'way History be turned into a dull mess where all the women end up being boring... even Bette Middler ;who can save most anything; couldn't lift this Turkey out the mud! The casting was right, but the ladies had nothing to work with. Leachman who is super funny didn't have a single funny line. Don't waist you money on this ...."
1,Uninteresting and shallow,"This movie has a great cast but there was absolutely no chemistry between the women. It was hard to believe that they would even be friends; a stereotypical lesbian, earth mother, career woman and the ""happily"" married working mother. I didn't care about any of these women. This is a good movie to pick up at your local library and watch for free to pass a few hours but that's about all it's worth."
1,One star is too many!,"This movie is neither intelligent nor humorous. While I am unfortunately acquainted with women who are as self-indulgent and insipid as the women in this film, I would certainly never waste two hours with them. Why then waste two hours with ""The Women""?This film may have been tolerable had the characters not been turned into caricatures. Jada Pinkett Smith as the ""lesbian"", Eva Mendes as the ""mistress"" and Annette Bening as the ""feminist"" were cartoonish.Meg Ryan's portrayal of the betrayed wife was completely flat and all I can say about the Debra Messing character is that it defies description.This movie is a complete waste of time."
2,Under-developed,"I had high expectations. The cast is brilliant - the director as well. Yet these characters just seemed undeveloped - there wasn't enough going on to tie them closely enough. It was mainly a set of acquaintances thrown together. And maybe just 1 man would've helped keep this movie interesting. I think Diane English had a gazillion-dollar opportunity - but it seemed to fall flat. Predictable - boring - and too much posing. Ok Meg, we get ""the hair.""I wished to see more struggle - then maybe I could've bought the ending. Too bad."
4,Fun movie,I really liked this fun movie. Beautiful woman and great actresses looked like they enjoyed making this film.
1,A remake that should have never been made!,"Anyone on here who gave this horrible remake of a classic movie more than 1 star hasn't seen the original! Terrible script with a few of the classic lines from the original movie thrown in(and certainly don't work in this version, either) a decent cast who struggle with this trash, it stinks from beginning to end. Not even a few shining moments....so disappointing. It does prove that the writers, directors and actors of today can't hold a candle to those from the golden era of film. Watch the original if you want to see a classic, funny and well acted from beginning to end. This version sucks, plain and simple!"
2,"movie ok, jada smiths lackluster acting i could do w/o","the ladies were ok but it def doesnt hold up to the classic and jada smiths acting where she always tries to act 'cool' is so phony to me i'm not sure how she gets movie roles if she wasnt married to Will or maybe her looks, idk. the movie has some ok moments and if you find at a pawn shop for a dollar i would get it but def wouldnt buy it new."
5,Great Movie,The movie was very enjoyable. I love a happy ending.Meg Ryan is a great actress.This movie is a real chick flick.
3,Great Cast Who Can Act--Just Not Evident in THIS movie,"Overall, I love the acting of nearly all of the cast members in this movie--just not in this particular flick. I too saw and loved the original and was thrilled to see a remake. Even before I received it, I read the Amazon reviews but still wanted to see it for myself. Unfortunately, I agree with most of the negative reviews. The actors, though generally outstanding in other vehicles, just weren't good in this endeavor. The acting was noticeably bad. The only standouts for me were Cloris Leachman and Debra Messing at the end. She was hilarious to me. In fact, her character seemed to have the only real honest reactions in the whole movie. I did enjoy the beautiful scenery and fabulous fashions. I also actually liked the soundtrack which I'm going to check out further. Bottom line? Wait until it comes out on cable or network TV."
3,The Women,"It arrived in a timely manner and is very good condition. However, the film itself is a dog. I was very disappointed as it has a wonderful cast."
2,Even the music....,"Even the music was bad. I looked forward to this movie for a year. I have always loved the original. The fabulous cast were all miscast; better use of Bette Midler, Chloris Leachman, and Lynn Whitfield would have helped. The settings and clothing were fun, as were the scenes in the store. Don't pay theater prices - view it when it gets to Blockbuster's bargain bin."
3,Enjoyed most of it.,Some really good acting but went a bit too long. Also felt the lesbian was a caricature - not in Jada Pinkett's acting which was great but in the plot written for her. Finally felt that never showing any of the male characters was a bit gimmicky.
1,The PC Girls,"Diane English said she thought the original was ""mean""...oh brother! Political Correctness is so damned boring. Why, oh why, do these Hollywood twits re-make Great Movies? Why don't they re-make lousy movies and try to make them better? I think it's just a lack of imagination. This 2008 version is to the 1939 version what warm Kool-Aid is to Champagne. Claire Booth Luce wrote a play, ""THE WOMEN"", which is sophisticated and razor-sharp funny. Joan Crawford's Crystal Allen alone would blow all these cutesy gooey girls off the screen. No comparison. If you like warm Kool-Aid, then by all means have the re-make. But, if you like wit and style, nothing can top ""THE WOMEN"" which has a stellar cast but also was directed by one of Hollywood's greats, GEORGE CUKOR."
1,Bad remake of a good movie,"This movie is bad. Considering the cast, it is the type of movie where good actresses go to die. Avoid this remake and watch the original instead."
1,worst (over) acting ever,"i thought meg ryan was the best in the movie and i dont even think she is a good actress. were they supposed to be over acting so much? the huffs and ridiculous faces. maybe i have never seen jada smith in a movie and only know her from the tabloids, but she was the worst. i thought annette benning was like watching a bad diane keaton imitation. it was bad bad bad. not funny at all, not one chuckle. glad i was multi tasking while watching this."
1,bad . . .,"this sucked. overracting and underacting and just plain bad acting. insightful to this extent: if art imitates reality it shows just how plain unbearable annoying and dysfunction ""people"" (read women) become who worship aesthetic (fashion, ""right"" associations, trends, successful image etc) as if it were religion."
3,"Shallow movie about fashion, hair, and manicures",All-star cast has no story. Movie praises high-end shopping and looks while just giving lip service to friendships. Notable for having no men in leading roles (or with any dialogue to mention). Moderately engaging.
3,Based on THEATER,"I've seen the bad reviews but honestly - just finished watching this and I can see where the bad review stems - however the film keeps to the screenplay - it's a movie based on the play and really, theater is quite cheesy - this element is apparent in the film. That said, I enjoyed it for what it's worth. I laughed. It was entertaining. Cheers!"
2,The Women,"Dont even bother watching. Meg ryans acting, betrayed by hubbie was so unbelievable. I think all these star women got together and tried to prove themselves but they fell flat. They showed how untalented they really are."
2,A movie about cheating without the cheater,"I do not like gimmicks. Here is a movie where the main plot is about a cheating husband. However, the dude never appears. It is a cute little gimmick but it destroys all of the drama. The acting is very good, the cast is all-star but the net effect is boredom. The musical score is basically non-existent. Whatever you do, do not buy this movie without renting it first. I rented it at our neighborhood supermarket for a dollar. That is all it is worth."
1,A GREAT film to get rid of your in laws during the up coming holiday season,"What a waste of great talent to be in a movie like this,and what the hell happened to Meg Ryan? She was always so cute and pretty,now her face is so botox abused,it hardly moves.My Sister saw ""The Women"" at the theather when it came out last year,and half the audience was asleep,and the other half left before the film was over.If you want to get rid of your in laws this holiday season,put ""THe Women"" on your blue ray DVD player."
2,Unwatchable,"Sorry but I just could not watch this one. It all started with Annette Bening and her overdone portrayal of a older, sophisticated New Yorker. Her voice was so deep and her facelift so severe. It was hard to look at her. I just didn't sense any chemistry in this movie."
1,The original is soooooo much better !,If you haven's see the original -- you must !! .. and you'll see what I mean. This version is slow and boring ... as if it were made for people with the attention span of a door knob. The dialogs is sooooo sloooooow...the way some adults talk to infants .. or a new foreign exchange student. But the original .. not this one.
3,They're okay,"Not really reliable in the cold weather. We live in Alaska and trying to clean out my truck with these on a chilly day was practically impossible. They kept cracking and tearing. Other than that, they were okay. However, the shipping and handling is outrageous. I paid more for the s&h than the product."
1,Bunch of Mumbo Jumbo,This book is just full of mumbo jumbo. It makes the reader more confused. Do not waste your money on this. I can write something better than that.
1,Does not wipe off!,"These crayons are so much cheaper than the Crayolas, which is why I purchased them in the first place. The hidden cost is that they do NOT easily wipe off. I built up arm muscles I didn't know I had trying to get this stuff off. Terrible. Not worth it."
2,Vibrant but not easily removed.,"Regular washable crayons work well (not as vibrant), and clean off easier. A DAMP cloth helps removal tremendously. Not worth the cost."
1,Awful product,"I was lured by the idea that a child could draw with these on a dry erase board and not have to inhale the fumes that the markers emit. Okay- they have no fumes. However, they stain! We took them out of the package and set them on the ground so we could start to color on our board. Simply from sitting on the carpet they left stains. They were not pressed into the carpet, they were not dropped onto the carpet. They were set there and still left stains. Can't get them out of our lovely wool carpet. And what makes them even worse is the fact that they are difficult to erase off of the dry erase baord. A child would have a very difficult time of it. I have to switch back and forth between a dry paper towl and a wet one to make a dent on the erasing. What an awful product. So they stain and they don't erase too well. Why bother? I won't ever again. They have been thrown out."
5,Kilmer shines again!,"At First Sight - Excellent Val Kilmer film. Val's acting is so exceptional that he is very believable as a blind man. The story is based on real people. Mira Sorvino has great chemistry with Val and Nathan Lane and Kelly McGillis as Val's older sister round out the cast. A nice love story.Kill Me Again - Wow, great story with lots of twists. Val and his beautiful wife Joanne Whalley-Kilmer make the movie sizzle. Michael Madsen Plays a really good bad guy. Full of action."
5,A Dream Come True,"I can only add to the the chorus of praise for this outstanding production. It unbelievably good. I am a great fan of Baroque Opera and this presentation is a dream come true. The music of Lully is done on period instruments, the sets, costumes, stage machinery, dances and dance steps true to the era, singers who can sing such music naturally, even the lighting by candles and all this conducted by someone who is akin to the spirit of the composer. This is truly heaven-sent. I always approach productions of Baroque and Bel Canto opera DVDs with great trepidation as so often the directors, curse them, will present Romeo and Juliet in a Brooklyn brothel or worse, or some other Eurotrash clap-trap e.g just look over what's been done to Handel's masterpieces. Here at last is what can be done by dilligent and respectful production personel and musicians. I am simply awe struck by the masterful presentation"
5,"Fantastic, Gorgeous, Sumptuous!","I can't really add anything to what the other reviewers have said, except to echo their praise! If you liked Lazar's production of ""Sant'Alessio"", also available on DVD, then you'll love this one.A little warning about the subtitles: they might not work on older DVD players. I couldn't get any subtitles, in any language, to display on a circa 2000 player, but they worked fine on brand-new equipment. I know someone else has had the same problem, so I don't think it was simply a defect of my own copy."
2,argh!,"My son likes this, but when I turned it on, found that the light really doesn't light up the thomas. The thomas is more of a shadow with a light in the background. Looks great when lights are on, but...what's the point? it's a night light."
1,Flawed,The CD I received would not play on my CD player. I tried numerous times but nothing happened. The other CD's I ordered worked fine so it wasn't my CD player
2,Not what I was hoping,The music itself is well done. Too many slow (and somewhat boring) songs. A lot of talent displayed by all...just not what i was hoping to hear.
3,AMWAY-ites take note....,"Dexter Yager is a several-times Diamond level AMWAY distributor. In this slim book he shares the principles that are the basis to his success, as well as many, many photos of himself and his wife with seemingly every conservative politico and entertainer of the late 20th century.Don't expect a lot of mention of AMWAY. As a matter of fact, I believe the only mention of it comes in the back pages where he promotes his other books. Do expect a lot of recycled and regurgitated Zig Ziglar, Norman Vincent Peale, Napoleon Hill and like motivational gurus, and stories of people who have risen from major problems to success and riches.If you are an AMWAY-ite, or an Amwegian, this book is for you. It is also for you if you are willing to put everything else in your life on hold 9n singleminded pursuit of the ""American dream."" Otherwise, don't bother."
3,Decent.,"I loved the first book, How To Lose a Guy in 10 Days. However, I was a little disappointed in this book. Not as funny as the first. It still has quite a few good jokes, but not as many. I think this book is less funny for a few reasons.First, I think the novelty has worn off if you've read the first one. The crayon drawings aren't as appealing the second time around.Second, I think the narration is less involving. (I know, that sounds like a ridiculous criticism of a book of this nature, but keep reading.) The first book told you what to do. It was a direct connection with the audience. This book tells the audience what the boyfriend does, so it comes off as further removed.Finally, there are a few cliches to be found in this book. For example, one of the ""signs"" is if he talks about how rich he is then forgets his wallet on a date.All in all, not a bad effort and there is fun to be had."
4,"cool, and tons of jude law",Jude Law and Gretchen Mol have little chemistry (I blame that on her) but the story does have its cute moments. Jennifer Tilly and Brenda Blethyn provide the movie with more plot advances butthe movie still is a cute romantic comedy. Jude Law give Danny many layers and at the end he is a great romantic hero.
3,A Nice Movie... But,"This was a sweet picture, a nice picture... but with the talented cast here it should have been a great movie. There was just too slender a premise to base the story on and I had a strong desire to shake some of these people and say, ""Get a grip."""
2,Trying to have it both ways,"Many here have tried to explain why a film with such a charming and clever set-up should have turned into such a mediocre movie.The filmmaker was obviously terrified of being accused of ""sentimentality"" (whatever that is). So, he threw in every kind of quirky unpleasantness he could think of, so that no one could accuse him of making a feel-good movie. He succeeded.Unfortunately, people who hate feel-good movies are not pleased either because of the charming and clever set-up. The characters are not nasty enough, and there is an almost total lack of hostility anywhere in the film.Moral: Decide what audience you're going to aim at. Go for them and write off the others."
5,One of the best ever!,"I am so glad other people share my opinion of this fabulous movie. I can't even begin to describe how much I loved it. Just read through the rest of the comments, and let me say ""ditto"" to all of them.GO OUT RIGHT NOW AND RENT THIS MOVIE.One note to the distributor: Why isn't this available on video - or better yet, on DVD - anywhere? I found it several months ago, at an exorbitant price, but since then, everyone says it's not available to buy.Get a clue guys! Just look at all these rabid, video-buying fans here!"
4,Absolutely Remarkable,"I happened to tune into HBO on a Sunday afternoon, and to my suprise I found this ""gem"" of a movie. This movie is a movie that makes you ""feel"" & totally allows you to believe in the ""magic"" of love. My husband came home and found me crying. I told him he had just missed a great movie. He laughed at me for crying over a ""movie"", but I'll tell you...he saw it later & told me I was right on the money...however, he held his tears! The storyline to this movie moved so well, that you were caught up in it and were one with it. Jude Law has show such great acting potential, that I can't wait to she him in his next feat. I'm speechless, yet I FEEL wonderful!"
5,I LOVED THIS MOVIE!!!,"HI, MY NAME'S DANNY. I HELPED DELIVER YOU AND NOW I'M DELIVERING YOU THIS CAKE!!! The first time I rented this movie, my sister and I literally watched it like ten times in the couple of days we had rented it. I love this movie!!! I think the script is hilarious!!! LAST TIME WE MET, YOU WERE COVERED IN AFTERBIRTH!"
3,Fun way to pass an evening...,"it's not spectacular, but I really enjoyed seeing Jude Law in a decent role. He's not my favorite actor (at all), but he's actually likeable here!"
4,We need more fairy tales in our lives ...,"I missed the first quarter of the movie today however that did not matter. This is a sincere, sweet, love story that explores the power of a young man's belief in fate and passion. It's fun and funny - I look forward to watching it from the beginning again soon. Jen Tilly is terrific. Savage Garden's ballad fits like your favorite sweater. Have fun !"
2,Only watched it for two things,"I love Brenda Blethyn as an actress and Jude Law too and both give amazing performances in this film that is so boring and original I thought I'd fall over asleep. Gretchen Mol cannot act, poor girl and I pity her for that. I was surprised though and happy over Jennifer Tilly's performance which I thought was funny (There should have been more of her). Brenda and Jude did amazing performances (as usual) in a pretty boring film."
2,it wasn't really bad,"It wasn't a bad movie. But I think the characters 'Nina' and 'Jesus' make the movie exciting. They steal the scene. Besides that, the movie is predictable, and they keep on playing that Savage Garden song (which can be annoying)."
5,A Great movie- but why can't we buy it?,"I'm just another fan of this beautiful movie, and I truly believe it should be available for purchase! What's going on? Hopefully the distributor will soon realize that this work of art should be in the homes of every love story sap like me!"
5,One of the best romantic comedies!!!!,"I'm so glad so many other people share my love for this movie! I watched it yesterday on HBO only because Jude Law, who I absolutely love, starred in it. I got much more than I asked for, with great performances by Jude Law, Jennifer Tilly, Brenda Blethyn and Martha Plimpton. I recommend this to everybody, even if you don't like romantic comedies!"
2,I am disappointed with telephone,"I cannot make it ring louder.I cannot get the second hand set to registerInstructions are confusingUniden TRU9488 Expandable Corded/Cordless Combination System with Digital Answering System, Dual Keypad, and Call Waiting/Caller ID"
3,NOT wall mountable,"We purchased this phone based on it being a version of the highest rated phone by Consumer Reports and ""Good Stuff-noreasonableofferrefused's"" stating that it was wall mountable. The latter was entirely false. In no way is this phone wall mountable - the only disappointment. So far our cats have not bothered it but we are wondering where we will put it if they do. Otherwise this is a pretty good phone with exceptionally good sound quality. The three-star review comes because the inability to wall mount it is a major drawback."
1,Huge disappointment,"This phone at first promised to be exactly what I was looking for: a corded base unit that would work in a power outage with a satellite cordless handset for mobility when I needed it. Over the past year I've had two cordless phones burn out in power surges (despite being on surge protectors) due to stormy weather, and I wanted something that would hold up. The first problem I noticed was an odd sound when I spoke into the mouthpiece, but I thought I could live with it. After just a month of using this phone, I am about to send it back and hopefully get a refund. For no apparent reason, the audio just quit -- no sound comes through the receiver of the base or the cordless unit. The answering machine picks up but does not take messages. I've been trying to deal with Uniden's customer service with with no success. I feel gypped and would NOT recommend this phone to anyone. I just hope the company honors their warranty."
5,Very happy,"This phone is very easy to use once you learn the menus. Many options that I didn't need, but fit the bill for those I did. Speaker is very clear, and I love knowing I can check phone mail from any extension. It's also compact enough, it doesn't take up a lot of table top space. But the small phone does not take away from the size of the display."
5,Awesome,It is so fantanstic to be able to have so many phones on one main machine. To the shop to the boat house to the garage it is fantastic...not to mentions other rooms..WOW
4,Great System,"This really is a great system. There are so many awesome features to both phones, and you can add up to 9 more handsets if you need. My only disappointment was that it is not designed to mount on the wall. The corded phone is strictly a desktop phone. Other than that we love everything about it. It is user friendly, and looks great. No REAL complaints."
3,"The Good, The Bad and the Ugly","The Good..... The built-in speaker phone on the handset is particularly good, with clarity and volume exceptional;Excellent menuing system, intuitive and easy to followThe Bad.... The quality of the speaker on the corded portion of the phone is muddled and difficult to hear; Handset is smaller than I would have liked with keys being smaller than they should be.The Ugly.... The character display is squeezed too closely together making it difficult to read;Overall impressions.. this phone appears to be typical of the current generation of corded/cordless phones. Unlike cell-phones the accent should not be on size reduction. Form should follow function not vice-versa"
3,Office Phone,I like the way it lights up when I have a message. The sound is clear and works well for me. It has good volume control. I wanted a corded phone in my office.Problems include: Confusing to use. I have to refer to the manual often. If it is the only phone you use it would be fine. If you change to several other phones it's difficult to remember how it works.I would look longer before I bought this item again.
1,poor sound quality,"I have the 8866 system and 8 handsets, but purchased this for the corded handset, and set the extra handsets to this, unplugging the 8866. The base signal is not powerful enough to prevent static even on the same floor of our house. Have to change back to the 8866."
1,piece of junk,Do NOT buy this phone system! Bought it a year ago and one by one the portable phones died! Now even the console is dead!
2,Disappointing,"Hate to rain on the parade - bought the TRU9488 largely based on Amazon reviews - but two units I've purchased from two different retailers and returned are big disappointments for the same reasons. No resolution in the user manual, so have to assume it's a manufacturing defect.Sound quality of the corded handset is tinny and pathetic. Stangely, it sounds fine when the AC power was removed to test the unit's power failure capabilities. Callers complained the speaker portion gave them an echo and I'm not even on VOIP.Loved the other features. Menus were relatively intuitive on both the base and cordless. Display was easy to read.Twice burned. Going to look at another manufacturer."
1,DO NOT BUY !!!!!!,I bought this set of three cordless phones and all three quit working with in one year. the caller id button stopped working on all of them except the corded phone. worst product I've ever had fron Uniden I did expect more.
1,Simply garbage - no gift wrap wasted here,"If you are looking for a thought-provoking book of meditations to inspire greater spiritual awareness or deepen your understanding and consciousness about faith in a ""Higher Power"" you will not find it here.This book is a disappointment, waste of time and money.What kind of ordained minister writes, ""One Christian is no Christian"" (page 544). How can she judge another as a ""godless Yankee"" and determine she was ""not a church-goer"" because the woman resented the invasion of her personal spiritual choices (pages 235-236)?Much of the text was nothing but inane prattle and stream-of-consciousness musings with spiritual ideas included as an afterthought.Most tiresome were her writings for Christmas. Pregnancy tests? Baby showers? Maternity clothes? Morning sickness? The author's attempts at analogy seem particularly pathetic in light of her repeated declarations of sadness and regret over her own childlessness."
2,Caution,"I purchased this generator a month or so ago. It looks to be a very well made high quality unit.A word of caution. Powermate is not part of the Colman company. Powermate is no longer in business, so there is no manufacture support for this unit."
1,Poor foot design,"Our teacher recommended the Kun shoulder rest. This was our 2nd in less than six months. There is a design flaw with the overmoulded leg with screw, so that there are only so many times you can push the shoulder rest on the violin before the rubber will crack at the screw. Our first shoulder rest lasted a few months. This one only lasted a few weeks. I will not be buying another one unless they change their design so it does not include a hole in the rubber."
4,Good video for beginning sword work,"Belly dancing enthusiasts will enjoy this video. While it presupposes a knowledge of basic belly dancing technique that you will want to draw on, you can use this video to teach yourself the new area of sword work. She does a good job, and the video goes through each portion of the routine two times, to lock in the moves. She is a good teacher, and you will learn some new moves from this video. She is also fun to watch, and exudes a positive joy in her dancing... also important. Good luck!"
1,Not much of a holocaust movie,"This movie barely touches on the holocaust. Some of scenes that it does show from the holocaust were actually scenes from when the people were liberated, not when they were being brought to the camp, which made me think that the movie was just thrown together, grabbing a few scenes from youtube. I could probably say in one breath the amount that was quoted from the diary. It's more a movie about a woman who doesn't get along with her mother, is popular on her radio talk show, and her marriage is in trouble. Then there's some stuff about a woman in Poland who left her diary to her daughter. It's not a good movie no matter what tags you put on it because the acting is bad and the story line is worse. Save your money and skip this one."
1,Not worth a dime,"This movie had a terrible plot, terrible acting, terrible setting, terrible everything. I was very disappointed! It had an interesting storyline, but the script was not developed fully."
3,Interesting Perspective,"Having been to Poland and visited Jewish memorial sites as well as having read many accounts of this period in history, I found this film interesting but not compelling. It took awhile to figure out the connection between the characters in the film. The ending also was a bit strange leaving one wondering with no final closure."
3,Too big for my head,"This cap is too big for my female head, so my hair almost inevitably gets wet. Other than the size issue, it is great material and cool looking."
1,OK if plastic smell were not overpowering,"The cap is on the thin side, but the print is nice and not very thight. However, the cap has a very, very pronounced plastic smell --can be perceived not just by you throughout a workout, but by other folks. The smell lingers afterwards and impregnates clothes, hair, etc. and it still remains even after two workouts. Cap seems to have suffered some discoloration even after one workout as well."
3,See the Movie - skip the book.,"I love this movie, so I thought it might be fun to read the book. This is one of those instances where the movie is far superior to the original material. The outlook of the book is a touch world-weary and banal and lacks the sparkle, charm, vivacity, sweetness and wit of the film. The film is a gem - stick with that."
5,Great Album,"I at first bought the 12"" for U Don't Know Me, and I absolutly LOVE that song. The vocals have a great message behind them, and its just a great song. But the 2 Future 4 U album is packed with great tracks, I enjoy every song very much. The beat in Entra mi Casa is very addictive and fast. Buy this Album"
4,"Tight beats, dope treats!","I really enjoy Armand's work. He has a very distinct style and seems to enjoy using various items for musical effect -- and example is a good ole handsaw as a beatline for one song. Overall his album is so-so, with highlights including ""Psychic Bounty Killaz,"" and ""U don't know me"" among others. Of course, most people buy this because of U don't know me. Plain and simple, this song is a true anthem, right up there with Stardust, and it's been really hot up here in Northern cali along with Bounty Killaz for quite some time now. I would definetely recommend this album to the clubber fans out there -- it will not dissapoint, as Armand produces a great album to headbob and spin to. __RS"
3,new york deep house for the masses?,"Early morning in the car, station surfing when I stumbled upon ""you don't know me""'s addictive hook and loop. With in seconds I'm singing along, drawn into the cheesy loop, instantly longing to return to the the club I had just departed from. Over the next few week's it becomes a heavy favorite. The feel of ""you don't know me"" is almost reminisent of Deelite's late 80's smash ""groove is in the heart"". Although the rest of the album was considerably flat and standard, ""you don't know me"" has the power to bring me back to after hours new york."
2,NOT THAT GREAT DONT BELIEVE THE HYPE,"After reading the other reviews and being a big fan of Armand I thought this album would knock me off my feet with the classic bouncy beats that Armand is known for.....I WAS REALLY WRONG. The album has this weird hard, and grating affect to it, its very mechanical and metallic, its not the pleasure house ive come to know and love from ARmand, im very disappointed be careful, if house is what your looking for, look away, the one song that made it You dont even know me, is the only joint even remniscent of his style, so take my advice and just get the single"
4,Hail Mr Van Helden,"when i bought this cd, i bought it for two tracks only ("" you don't know me "" and ""flowers"". but i think i got more than what i burgained for. he is a master at work. could anyone please send me armand van heldens e-mail address."
5,A little gem of a movie.,"This is a very enjoyable family movie. My wife and I have watched this several times and shown it to friends. The women tend to cry although I wouldn't call this a sad movie. The little girl and the old man are a joy to behold. Theirs is a simple life in a world far removed from western civilization. She is looking for love and he, at considerable cost to himself, is willing to provide it. As the story transpires we see the effect this has on all those around. A life affirming story. Highly recommended."
1,Boring and disapointing,"It took forever to see this predictable story. The script is like those of the time Mao was around, showing how people should be behaving. The story drags forever, every movement is predictable, acting is amateurish. I wish I did not bought this DVD. The other reviews are very misleading. The only tear I shed was for the money spent on this mediocre work."
4,Brown & Proud,"Well, I just got this CD last night at midnight and I've only heard it once, but it definitely rocks. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of five is because of the unexplainable absence of ""L.M.L.Y.P."" Maybe there were some copyright issues with The Artist or something. I also would've liked to see ""Frank"" on here, but Ween could put out a 10-disc live box set and people would still complain about exclusions. All in all, it's a great addition to the Ween catalog. I can't wait for the tour this summer."
3,"great album, but disappointing from Ween","There's no such thing as a bad Ween album. Some are just better than others. I was really looking forward to the double-disc live set from Ween, but was disappointed. I've seen them in concert so I know first hand how amazing they are, and this CD just doesn't seem to capture the magic. I'd also much rather have more songs in place of a 20+ minute version of Poopship Destroyer. That song is way too long and annoying on here. This is probably near last on my ranking of all the Ween albums."
3,Interesting but too brief,"""Chicago Sketches"" is comprised of dozens of very interesting short chapters about Chicago history. Especially welcome are the lesser known incidents in Chicago's past that are included here which are as worthy of attention as the famous ones.But, indeed, ""sketches"" is an accurate description. These stories are really too short to satisfy the curiousity they have created, and ultimately leave the reader disappointed and wanting more.This book could best be considered as a good springboard to inspire us to read more about Chicago history elsewhere."
5,Cruise ship entertainer makes good!,"Matt Clark was one of the Royal Caribbean singers and dancers on the cruise ship ""Radiance of the Seas"" in June of 2005. He was amazing, a very talented singer/piano player. I bought this CD on the ship and have enjoyed it very much."
5,"So catchy, I just keep listening","My mp3 player may soon file a protest if I don't start to listen to a different album. Ever since this one arrived, I've been listening to it daily, inadvertently learning the lyrics, and humming the melodies. The songs are so catchy and upbeat that you won't even notice that they aren't in English. I know this is my favourite of all of Frida's solo albums, and really hope she'll get back into the studio one day."
1,Old fashioned album,"What an old fashioned album. The rather weak voice of this ABBA girl doesn't get to shine on any of the songs. It all sound boring and there is a lack of warm atmosphere, which is always there on the ABBA records and even on her former collque Agnetha's post solo efforts. Frida, it is time to retire! (she sounds like she already has on this album..) This album is a stain on ABBA's wonderful repertoire! Shame on you Frida!"
1,Baaaaad service,"I ordered a size 10 and got a size 10.5. I asked the supplier to cover the cost of return since I live overseas. They never replied to me. Thus, I am now left with a product which does not fit me and which I can not return. Simply overall bad service."
1,Secure but flawed,"The lock seems very sturdy. I would suggest leaving the 0-0-0-0 combination though. I followed the directions very carefully and set the lock to my desire combination. Then when I tried to open it it wouldn't open. I went back to 0-0-0-0 and that didn't work either. So you would think that I either failed to set the lock and the 0-0-0-0 combo would work, or the combo I set would work. But all for not, neither worked. The lock set its own combo and forgot to tell me. So now I have an ugly paperweight."
5,Almost Every Prodigy Song Worth Having Plus a Few Extras,"Unlike the other review for this item, I will attempt to write something that has something to do with this item. I picked it up (dollar amount), and at the time I bought it I thought it was a bit much. Now that I've had it for a while, I realized that it was worth every penny. This boxed set has all the import singles before the release of Fat of the Land, which includes Firestarter and Breathe. In all, there are 11 cd's with 230 minutes of music. The boxed set also comes with a Zippo lighter engraved with Firestarter, a ring engraved with One Love, and nose spike. (The one I got didn't have the nose spike, I don't know if the previous owner lost it or just didn't feel like giving it away. But that's not something you'd want used anyway.) In all, it is absolutely amazing, and is a must buy for any hard core Prodigy fan."
2,Anti - American,"While I've been a big fan of Ghost In The Shell, these stories are the worst yet. (I've watched the first three episodes on Cartoon Network as the DVD is not out yet).In ""Make Up"", the story is flawed in that Paz would have never been allowed to roam ""free"" while an exact copy cat of himself is on the lose killing people.In ""Poker Face"" the ""Emperial"" America is such and Anti-American statement especially when the Amercian UN Forces have the American flag sewed on their uniforms backwards! This may have been an error but I doubt it.In PAT. the tachikoma's voices are so annoying and so much information is thrown at you that it's hard to follow. Most if is a rehash on previous episodes. With their childest voices, they shouldn't be used as a main plot of the story."
4,It's a hit with everyone,"I purchased this as a gift for my nephew's 5th birthday. Out of all the gifts, he wanted to open this one and play with it first. My sister put it together rather quickly. The parts snapped into place securely. I'm not sure if a child would have been able to do it, as she had to put some muscle into it. The kids at the party all wanted a turn with it, and when it got put on the table, the adults were playing with it too! The only reason I gave it 3 stars for durability is that it hasn't been out of the box very long. It seems to be well made, but that doesn't always mean much in the hands of little boys. The only downfall is that the pinky and ring finger move together, not individually. Otherwise, this is great!"
3,Stuart Gordon's best work in years!,"Surprisingly enough, this is director Stuart Gordon's best work in years. The first half is really atmospheric,while his trademark gore (and camp) soon follows. If you like Gordon (especially if you enjoyed ""Dagon""),this dvd is a must."
3,All this for one episode?,"This is a GREAT series on TV.....I've enjoyed creeping out to the updated Twighlight Zone type stories.However....with all the televised series out there, coming out in ""Season Issues""....are we to be expected to pay this kind of money ""Per episode?"" Think I'll wait for the boxed set."
4,Masters of Horror - Stuart Gordon - Dreams in the Witch House,"Very good and disturbing interpretation of an H. P. Lovecraft tale, but I believe the author might have wanted more concentration on atmosphere and less visualized gore (but then that is the norm currently). There are some very good scenes in this but taken as a whole not as evenly satisfying as ""The Black Cat"", another of Mr. Gordons' Masters of Horror tales."
3,Okay Lovecraft adaptation,"A graduate student (Ezra Godden) and his lovely neighbor (Chelah Horsdal) find that their low-rent apartment building has a rather disturbing occupant.This is a decent little horror film, but it has the same flaw as so many horror films: characters are required to behave in unbelievable ways in order to reveal information that the viewer needs to make sense of the plot. More work should have been done to supply important facts in a more organic manner. It doesn't help that the rat-man (Yevgen Voronin) effects were more ridiculous than frightening; Voronin should not have played it like a rodent from a cartoon."
4,A must own for Stuart Gordon fans (whom all probably have it)!,"This is one of my, if not the, favorite episodes in the Master's of Horror series!I've been checking for Gordon films since seeing Re-Animator years ago, and this is an excellent piece of his body of work! Also, see ""Dagon""!"
4,Brings back memories....,"OK,if you can get past the big hair on the cover,inside you will find a little masterpiece of 80's nostalgia. This cd is Solid,if not spectacular.There is no reason to skip thru any of the tunes,just enjoy them all. I can remember buying this cd and cruising the open road while blaring Gimme Your Love,and Love is not a game, thru my speakers....oh man,has it really been 20 years since this thing has been released? MSG released 2 more cd's after this one,but in MY opinion,neither one matched the quality of this one. I guess it was a matter of Perfect Timing!"
3,Not the best Schenker,"...because this is AOR music. Still very enjoyable. Best songs here are ""Rock til' you're crazy"" , ""Love is not a game"", ""Gimme your love"", ""Here today - Gone tomorrow""."
2,Alright,"I bought this book from Borders and it looked alright. NOT!! I started to read the book and as I read to the middle of the manga, it made no sense. I was going to give it 1 star, but Mink is just totally cute!! :)I don't think you should buy this, you'll waste money."
5,Interview,To listen to this is clear. Not a lot of background sound. I love Annie Lennox any ways this is just one more thing to get to know her a little better.
1,"1/2"" short.....",I love Amazon but will not be buying any car parts here. This belt is 1/2 inch small but still it says that it's made for my car.... Very disappointing!
2,What is this world turning into!,"There is absolutely no point in buying this graphics card. If you are looking for an upgrade, dont get this. Gamers are the only people that need to upgrade grahphics cards and this is no gamer graphics card. Don't let the price and descriptions fool you. It doesn't use an Advanced Graphics Processor (AGP) and it's an 8mb card. You probably already have a better graphics board in your system than this one. Don't let ATI fool you. If you are looking for an upgrade you can get a GeForce 3 or the new Radeon 8500 card made by ATI, but don't get this graphics board. You will not be happy with it."
5,Very helpful accesories,GIves great flexibility in terms of placement of the TomTOm unit(s). Very helpful in minivans and other cars where the windshield is far from the steering wheel.
1,Oasis' new direction is terrible.,I was really excited when I got on Spotify today to listen to some good ol' fashioned rock music by the one and only Oasis and too my surprise I saw that there was a new album on there and I went to listen to it and I didnt like it. Noel's vocals sound like a woman and the band is playing some kind of weird old riffs this was bad. I burned my Oasis shirt.
3,Noel and Bonehead sets it off!,"This interview has, by now, become a bit outdated but is still a gem. Noel and ex-Oasis Paul 'Bonehead' Arthurs talk about Oasis and how they cope with fame and where their music comes from. Occasionally the interview is hard to understand because of their accent and sometimes they seem bored with the questions. The booklet gives a brief history of the band, with complete discography and gigography. The major highlight of this is the fact that Bonehead, Oasis' rhythm guitarist, gets a chance to speak and that the interview takes place at the height of Oasis' success."
3,Only an average treatment of the topic,"While this book begins well by pointing out the importance of theological reflection, it does not follow through with a substantive discussion. The methods and examples given are not especially thought-provoking. The style of writing is occasionally stilted and the content often seems contrived. Further, the book is neither thorough nor concise. While there are some good points to be gleaned here, I would point someone to Stone and Duke's ""How to Think Theologically"" instead."
4,The art of theological reflection,This book has come highly recommended for EfM mentors. I have really learned the subtle details of TRs. Easy read and very informative.
1,a great disappointment,"This text reads like a theological version of a 70s pop psychology self-help book. With all of the richness that might have been explored, the text is trite and even a bit condescending. I was required to buy this for a grad course...and was shocked to find the vocabulary and the notions altogether fit for a junior high school exploration of the topic. Look elsewhere."
4,Good Job,"The book came in excellent condition and within the allotted time. However, in the past I have been ""spoiled"" by sellers that send books that arrived much sooner than I had expected. No reflection on this seller, however, and I was pleased that it arrived in time for me to take it with me to read on a plane ride..."
3,Only SOME Holidays,"Lots of stickers for Christmas, Easter, Valentine's Day and St. Patrick's Day but no Hanukkah, Halloween, Presidents Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day. (seriously? not one flag?)"
2,"Said it fit a 2000 Toyota 4Runner, but was way too small!","Specifically ordered this style because it said it fit our 2000 Toyota 4Runner. When we opened the pkg the invoice said it was for our vehicle but the mat was way TOO small! We're guessing the wrong item was sent, and AMAZON.com took care of the return no problem. Also it seemed a bit expensive after seeing the quality, a little flimsy and we won't be ordering another one."
5,Great product,I had this product less than a week when something got spilled in the back cargo area. All I had to do was lift it out and spray it off. It was a life saver. Also my stuff does not slide to the rear and when I open the back stuff does not come splilling out on the ground.
2,Look into something else,"I needed to remove some concrete so I picked up a couple of these bits at the Big Box. They did the job, that is, poked about 20 holes so that sledging the pavement would be easier. Job done. HOWEVER: Both bits began flattening out after about two holes! I literally trashed two of these bits before they could get hot! If you're going to do substantial work, you'd be better off purchasing a better grade bit."
5,works good and lasts a long time,"i drill a lot of holes in concrete and these bosch bits are the best. they outlast dewalt and definitely outperform the cheap ones you get at trade shows, etc. these bits cost a little bit more, but last so long that you actually get more value and a cheaper ""per hole"" cost. i used a lot of bits that the heads literally melted off, but these have a great design and the tips are really bonded well to the shank"
1,Book friendly BUT...,Hard to rate because the product was NOT Apple/Mac compatible and I had to return it. It looked great on the desk but just wouldn't run.
4,Takes a couple of listens to take hold,"At first, Aslyn sounds like she's just trying to fit in with the current pop crowd. But the more you listen, the more her individuality comes out. She is not as bubblegum pop as Ashlee Simpson, Lindsay Lohan, and Hilary Duff - and she's not as rocky as Avril Lavigne. Aslyn needs more exposure - this, along with Anna Nalick's Wreck Of The Day, has been one of the better pop releases of 2005."
4,"I hope to find my ""Wally""","I, too, had never heard of Aslyn until seeing her open for Ryan Cabrera. She was amazing! She can wear out a piano and sounds even better live (as does Ryan Cabrera)!I ""gotta get over"" my stupid heartache in hopes to find my ""Wally!"" Those two songs, ""Gotta Get Over You"" and ""Wally"" are my absolute favorites. I have been caught by several passer-bys singing my heart out in my car to ""Wally."" But, I don't care. I LOVE THIS SONG!!Aslyn has a sound all of her own. Spread the word and buy the CD! She deserves to be noticed."
4,No lemons here...,I first saw Aslyn open for Gavin Degraw and was very impressed with her. She is a true performer and a gifted singer/songwriter. The songs are catchy and the lyrics have meaning. Be sure to pick this one up - you won't be disappointed.
2,title of review,"I thought this would be something with more musical substance, since this girl, with her frizzy hair and drab clothing, obviously isn't trying to be hot or hip in any conventional way, but this music is totally conventional, overproduced, mediocre, forgettable pop-rock, and she sounds like she's trying really hard to be a good conventional pop singer, the vocals are like an overdone american idol audition. This is just garbage."
3,Okay as an Introduction to the Art,"This film didn't really have much in the way of educational information. It was basically a bunch of big names in the business talking about what they enjoy about doing their work, a handful of personal stories lacking detail and a few cool behind the scenes moments.The enthusiasm of the interviewees makes this worth a watch or two as a rental, but it's not really worth the price unless you want to own everything related to Special FX."
5,A must have DVD for make up artists!,"It is helpful, informative and has amazing make up tips. As a make up artist I recommend it. I just love it."
4,good overview,gave a brief sample of a hand-full of FX artists & their works; good for those who don't know alot about these artists
2,not for actual learning,was disappointed that this did not help start off a desire for creating visual effects. it was just a documentary on how those in the past and present got started in it and how long they have been doing it aswell as their films
1,Disappointing,"Fantastic Flesh: The Art of Make-Up EFX, was completely misrepresented and truly disappointing. Absolutely no tangible information. As a special effects artist, I expected more that a line up of Makeup artists telling their personal stories. My recommendation is to AVOID it, I'm sure it will be on television in the very near future."
4,Not really what I needed but seemed cool,"I ordered this with a bunch of other items. I had a project to do but I wasn't sure where to start. This item didn't happen to be part of what i used, but I put it in the library for possible future needs."
1,"Poor support, doesn't work in XP","Doesn't work with Windows XP. This is ridiculous. There are plenty of companies out there that have upgraded their drivers for Win XP. There has been plenty of time. However, although their website (which isn't working right now) claims a 3-6 month timeframe of getting XP drivers ready from July 2001. They still are not ready.Poor support. If you buy this, beware. It is obvious that they either don't care about their customers, or they do not have the development staff to properly support their own product."
3,Doesn't have driver for XP,My reader worked fine until upgrading to XP. The W2K driverhasn't been blessed by Microsoft and you're told so whentrying to install the driver. I went ahead and installed thedriver anyway and the device worked for a few minutes before XPblue-screened.I checked the PNY site and supposedly this device is suppose towork with XP.
1,Does not work with XP,This worked ok with Win 2000 but when I switched over to XP it would not work at all... it might as well get tossed in the trash.
3,"no frills, but it works on win2k","I bought the PNY unit to transfer pictures between my PC and compact flash cards. It saves my camera batteries and makes managing CF cards a breeze. I'm running Win2K pro and haven't experienced any serious setup or usage problems. The transfer speed is acceptable. I have not tried a smart media card yet. The CF reader shows up in explorer as a removable media device; my imaging software also finds it with no problems. The unit only has a power indicator and there is no visible way to tell when the reads & writes are finished. Also, while the USB driver works fine on my PC, the user interface for ejecting cards is clunky. Though I'm not unhappy with the PNY card reader, I'm not overjoyed. I would very much like a status light and a better eject method on my next card reader."
1,Dud - run don't walk from this product,"I purchased this Dual Card Reader 6 months ago and it's quickly proven to be a ""non-reader."" After the first 2-3 uses, this reader stopped reading my SmartMedia Cards. Actually, it generated messages that my cards needed to be reformatted. This happened with 2 separate cards from separate manufacturers. Thankfully, the cards still retained their images and I'm able to use them and view images via the camera's PC connection.Support or user-guides from PNY are virtually non-existent. Spend your money on a reliable product from another manufacturer."
3,Very small Pig,"This book is considered a classic in culinary circles for devouring a whole beast and wasting no part of the animal. The book and recipes are fantastic, however the small size of the book was very disappointing. Expecting an A4 size (normal cook book) I was upset to receive a pocket size version of the book. Could not see any reference to size in the advertisement. As i am a big collector of cookbooks i would have preferred to pay more and own a beautiful and long lasting cookbook. Will still use it but will never have the same love for it as i have for others!Long live the PIG!"
2,Decent,Not as good as what some reviews I've seen. Most if not all the recipes can be found either in other books or online.
4,Wonderful,"I was happy with the product I received, I did though receive it on the last day before I could have reported it."
3,interesting subject,"This really caught my eye because I thought it might have some recipes that are practical (if yucky sounding) for those of us who slaughter livestock at home. But most of the recipes are disappointing, with things everyone has heard of or stuff nobody would have around at home to use. It is interesting, but the title is really the best part of it. I'm not saying it is bad...it isn't...it just wasn't the shock-value sort of stuff I thought it would be."
4,Cooking book,"This is a great read - though not too many people have all of the ingredients necessary to actually cook the recipes. It's an interesting window on the way our grandmothers cooked, but with a gourmet twist!"
2,Takes too long to shock,"My dogs have learned that if the run over the mat that they don't get shocked. Like a previous reviewer they were jumping over the mat, so I also got the extention. I stepped on it and was really surprised how long it took to fire."
1,Shipping without the power pack!,"I ordered this item and the first time it shipped without the power pack so I had it replaced. The second time, it was also missing a power pack so I am just returning it. Amazon needs to fix this problem."
1,no battery pack TWICE - no quality control in packagin,I ordered this in desperate need of help with getting my dog to not go in the counter. Ordered Prime to get quickly.Arrived and NO battery pack. Returned and received the second one wtih NO battery pack.BAD quality check with packaging. Frustrated as now it is a week later and I still have no mat to help with the counter problem. And starting from scratch again
1,No battery pack included!,"Without a battery pack, which was supposed to be included in the purchase, according to ScatMat instructions, the ScatMat is useless. What should I do?"
3,Something wrong with battery pack,"There is some glitch that makes it trigger all the time, so it goes through batteries too quickly, and we also can't tell whether the cat has triggered it... but the one time he jumped up, it certainly worked. We had it on medium, and that was enough to send him cowering to the bedroom looking for comfort... a little harsh, but I'm an RN and can't have cat bottoms on the table... would be 5 stars if it worked properly."
5,Works great!,"The cats hate it, but I love it. I bought a new couch and it is off limits to the cats. This product has kept the cats off the couch and they don't seem too upset about it. The first couple of weeks they looked for a way around the mat. They found a few gaps and made their way to the back of the couch. I bought a second one for the back and closed that gap. They seem pretty content to stay away now. When my kitchen renovations are complete, I will be adding a third one to place on the countertop. This has been a great investment. I wish I had found this product sooner."
5,This product really works,"I just purchased italian leather furniture that I love, but so did my dog. I put the scat mats on the couch for two weeks and my 13 year old dog learned to not jump on them. Great product."
5,Awesome product,"I have 5 big dogs- 2 greyhounds, 2 Borzoi(Russian Wolfhounds, and the problem child- my Great Pyrenees. The sighthounds can be taught NOT to go in my living and dining rooms but my pyr will only respect the rules when I am home. When I'm not he feels he has to guard the entire house. The scat mat keeps him out of those rooms like no ohter barrier can. It gives an unpleasant charge like a static jolt from walking on carpet only more so. We had to buy replacement parts after 4 years and that's what this purchase was. We wouldn't be without ours. By the way, he is a dog with an obedience title so it's not that he isn't trained, he is. It's just that pyrs are sooo headstrong that all bets are off when mom and dad aren't around!"
1,Defective Product,"I had a 30 by 16 inch ScatMat to stop my cats scratching on the bedroom door. They learned to lean around it to reach the door. I bought the extension to stop this, however the item is defective. When the extension is plugged into the first ScatMat it causes both mats to fire every 5 seconds. The cord is also too long and easy to trip over, even when coiled. I do not reccomend."
4,"Cats are too smart, but it works","My cats are too smart for this so it definitely doesn't work as a training tool here, but it works and they do stay off it when it's there. If my cats want to get up on my counter enough though, they always cautiously step around this and find an area where they can jump up."
1,Didn't Work For Me,"I read the reviews and thought this was the solution to keeping my dog off my new couch -- but it didn't work. My battery was new, and the lights came on, but the connection just didn't emit any ""shock"" at all, at any setting. Yes, I followed the instructions and it should have worked, but I think I got a defective unit. Too bad."
5,It works well,My 93 lb dog will no longer go near the sofa. I am happy I do not have to vacuum her long hair off of it. I would recommend this to my friends.
5,WOW-Great Book!,"This is the first book I've read by James F. David. I'm off now to order the other ones. Terrific murder mystery, I was hooked from the first page. Loved the characters, the ""McKenzie pool"" is pure genius. I'd love to see another book based on the same group of detectives. If you like John Sandford, you'll love this book!"
1,Glad she's not my sister...,"I kept hoping this book would get better, but it was very boring and the author was extremely self-absorbed. It's one thing to tell your own story, but she was very passive-aggressive when she spoke of her sister and some of the celebrities that are no longer alive to defend themselves. About half-way through the book, I realized that Ms. Luft didn't come across as a very likeable person. No wonder there was tension between the sisters over the years."
1,If you don't have any talent - write a book.,Lorna Luft's book called me and my shadow is more of a complaint about being in the shadow of Judy and Liza. The book is homophobic and I feel incredbily sad that Lorna is trying to pass her own dauther off as the heir to Judy's throne.
2,The TV Movie Was Much Better,"With the exception of the last few chapters, Miss Luft's book doesn't come close to the home run hit by the TV movie version of this memoir. I knew Garland was hooked on perscription drugs and even though at 47 she looked much older, the surprising factor of the book was the extent to the addiction."
5,Me and My Al-Anon,"What is incredible about this book is Lorna Luft's first becoming acquainted, in her mid-thirties, with the theory of alcoholism as a family disease.It brings to mind Liza Minnelli's appearance on ""Inside the Actors Studio"" a year or two ago. She told the audience to look up alcoholism, because it actually is a disease!It makes one wonder whether these two were living under glittery, spangled rocks, or something.The book is an interesting read, but the many, many pages devoted to Ms. Luft's late-in-life revelations about her mother's and her sister's addictions are like patiently watching a child play with color crayons: You know you're doing the polite thing, but Gawd, it's boring.Finally, I wonder who edited this book. ""Me and Joey,"" and ""Me and Mama,"" and ""Me and Liza,"" and so on. After the first few dozen, it's like reading a letter from camp.Is it to remind the reader of the title of the book he already has in his hand, or is it just plain bad grammar?"
4,The Other Side of the Rainbow,"After seeing author Luft on ""20/20"", where she talked about how angry her family was about this book, I became interested in reading it. I was never a Garland fan, cringing at her neuroses every time I saw her, but my dad is nuts about her. You don't have to be a fan to find the story fascinating. Luft has great sadness and sympathy for the dilema her mother found herself in, and freely admits that the legacy of addiction continued with all Garland's children.Even Luft's own story is interesting, from the party years at Studio 54 to her involvement with her sister Liza, up until Lorna finally pulls herself and her life together. Sometimes there seems to be some name-dropping and a bit of envy there, but if the Rolling Stones were at YOUR wedding, heck, you'd talk about it too!"
3,Lorna Luft Tells her story how she saw it,"I liked the book over all but I am a BIG Garland fan I will admit though I was angry when I heard she was writing the book. I thought to myself oh gosh not another Mommy Dearest book. Lorna writes about her childhood openly and honastly, I do agree it did make some stars look bad. I didn't like the way Lorna complained about Judy's fans but I guess if I lost my mother I wouldn't want people reminding me everyday. I also, as a Judy fan worried that someone might read the book and just the bad stories about Judy would circulate. Overall I liked the book, and i do recomend that you read it =)"
5,Excellent,This book shows the many sides of Judy Garland and her family. Her daughter does an excellent job of displaying the truth. Parts of this book are humorous and parts are heart breaking but all in all it makes me enjoy Garland even more.
1,What a shame,"""Uh...... I do not have the talent, the personality and the look that my mother and my so-called sister Liza (if she still want to consider me as her sister after reading my book) have to become respectable and famous artist. What should I do? Oh! Yes. Write to book to condemn them and make myself look good, at the same time, some profit, of course......""I supposed this is what Lorna Luft had in mind before she started to write this trashy book. She try to condemn almost everyone in her book, and told the whole world that she was the only victim. The only thing I could say is, I felt so angry and sad for Judy Garland. She actually betrayed by her own daughter. Too bad this is no ""ZERO STAR"" for the rating.Lorna Luft, you......."
2,Eh...,"First few pages are well-written and engaging, and then it's down hill from there. Luft's tone is slightly self-aggrandizing, the book surprisingly sloppy in its editing, which makes it a less than satisfying read. Not much new material here, though the perspective is different from countless other Garland biographies. To give Luft her due, she was saddled with a crushing legacy, and all things considered, she has weathered it more successfully than her more famous sibling, Liza."
4,Great Laptop,"This laptop is perfect for the on the go user. It has a LED keyboard light, a battery that acts as a grip, thin LCD screen, and integrated wireless."
2,Typically poor transfer from Alpha,An interesting Euro epic is given a poor presentation on this poor quality Alpha DVD. The color is faded and the picture is not at all sharp. The Goodtimes VHS tape was even better than this and it wasn't all that good. Too bad we will probably never seen a decent widescreen version of The Old Testament on DVD. These Italian Sword and Sandal movies can really look great if given the proper treatment.
5,Gina,This is such a cute movie. Yes it does represent the Bronx because I am from that neighborhood and everything in it is 100% true. Go Nancy. Excellent work!
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:An interesting drama about two people who are going to get married just because it seems like they should, not because they love each other, True Love is a bit uneven and often dated but it's a reasonably successful movie if you don't ask for much."
2,Not the Bronx I know,"I am a transplant from New York to Connecticut. My husband and I wondered what Bronx this movie was about. One time there was a large Italian population around Pelham Parkway, but that was back in the 1960's. Over the years most Italians moved to Queens, Long Island or New Jersey. We couldn't figure out what time period this was supposed to represent. The Bronx changed colors from Italian and Irish to black.So for me this movie did not ring true. I did not see one black person in it. Not in the bars, or on the streets. I also could not understand why the bride didn't see her groom-to-be was a boy-man. He certainly showed that in his many promises to her to come back in an hour or so and then go out and get drunk with his friends.The acting was good. The music was terrific. However, because I felt the movie portrayed a Bronx that no longer exists, I wouldn't recommend it."
2,firebird &les noces dvd,"well performed, great for the lover of CLASSIC ballet. shot on a very obvious childishly simple stage. the ballet is technically correct but dead. no tv effects were used. look at the newest ""midsummer night's dream"" dvd to see what can be done with video and a computer. this firebird dvd is well danced but boring. i think it is a terrible dvd of an exciting ballet. this is not the dvd to teach your kids to love ballet. sorry . i am so disappointed with this dvd that i am trying to return it.BORING,BORING,BORING."
3,This is not the Paris Opera Ballet,"The Paris Opera Ballet laserdisc is definitive for Les Noces. The Afternoon of a Faun is also superlative at every level.This DVD is most welcome. The dancing in both Firebird and Les Noces is aboveaverage. However, particularly in Les Noces the ensemble lacks precision, verve, and the required intensity. This is a very difficult work, of great musical inventiveness and superior and hugely difficult choreography. This is a work that should judge ballet groups...and the Royal Ballet simply does not rise to this high mark.I yearn for the release of the Paris Opera Ballet laserdisc. What an accomplishment that was!"
4,An impressive Firebird,"My wife and I enjoyed this video very much. The technical quality was excellent. The performance was very good, well danced and entertaining, Why only four stars? It was somewhat less exciting than the best of the live performances we have seen. But we recommend it enthusiastically."
1,Outdated,There was no information that the book was published in 1986. If I new it I would not buy it. There is very limited use for a Restaurant Guide that is 15 years old.
5,My dad,"I bought this software for my dad when he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. It was a great way to help him maintain his memory and eye-hand skills, not to mention for anyone wanting to improve their short-term memory. It was recommended by the neurologist. Great."
4,Wonderful book for a freshman entering college life.,"This book doesn't let you put it down. Filled with exciting stories and characters. African-American or Caucasian, if you've been a freshman, you can relate to this novel."
4,One Hellified Story!,"I really enjoyed this story. I read a lot of books and this one kept my attention. I was impressed with Troy going from boy to man. I didn't think he was going to focus on his studies the way he did. Troy kept it real though. School first and the honeys' later. Tracy Grant, keep up the great work and I'm definitely looking forward to the next novel. Yvonda"
3,Good Reading for upcoming college freshmen,"While not my cup of tea, I did find Hellified interesting enough to want to recommend to some high school seniors who are planning to go away to college. I think the book gives a pretty good overview of some things that happens around college campuses, and of things that freshman exprience during their first experiences away from home and parental authority.Troy is a freshman at Georgetown. He finds out that all party and little studying is not good for the GPA. He is busy trying to ""get with the girls in the dorm"", become involved in extra cirrcular activities, and hanging out that he almost forgets why he is at Georgetown. Troy has a lot of growing up to do. This book hits on college drinking, sexual activities, clubs and organizations and coming of age, among other things. This book if taken seriously by the reader could become a handbook for the college freshman."
4,Very impressive and rare information about Okemah,"Anyone who is even remotely connected to or has family in the south Phoenix area will appreciate the work done by William E. (Bobby) Burt. The research ended at 48th Street to the east, 32nd Street to the west, Salt River to the north and Broadway Road to the south. Lots of pictures!"
3,A bit inconsistent for Kawasaki's normal levels...,"Although I am a big fan of Guy, this one was a disappointment compared to the standards I have come to expect from him. The title of book indicates a vast area to cover. But to my disappointment it seemed a bit inconsistent or out focus/unfocused. Maybe like the title.When all is said and done it has a multitude of cases, quotes and points in the usual Kawasaki style that can prove beneficial, but still not a clear classic."
4,A great book...,I used this book to cause havoc in my market where I was selling my and it helped increase my sales and profit. If you want to make more money then this is the book for you.
4,Excellent Tips and Strategies for Marketing,"Another good book by Guy Kawasaki - not great but good. It is full of interesting ideas (some controversial) on how to market and get ahead of your competition. Much of the book contains things you already likely know such as being customer focussed and creating evangelists for your products but it is well presented and is a quick, worthwhile read."
5,Dermatology paperback by Habif,"Excellent book, good pictures. I like the grouping by body part and specific classifications of dermatologic disorders."
1,1 Pack?...Just say 1 LOCK!,"I bought this lock believing it would be a ""pack"" of locks, it shows 4 in the picture and says ""1 Pack"".Just say ""1 lock"" and make it clear!BS play on words!"
1,plastic junk...,"I figured this would be a quality product but being plastic, a hammer will take the lock out."
2,Beware - only ships with ONE lock,"The title reads ""1 pack"" not ""1 lock"". A ""pack"" means a set. When I buy a ""pack"" of cigarettes, I expect to get more than one. The title also says ""colors (plural) may vary"" not ""color may vary"" The image shows a set. The product features says ""assortment of colors"" not ""available in an assortment of colors"". Given the number of customers who have complained about this. I am very surprised that the listing has not been made clearer. It should clearly state ""comes with ONE lock"" period, simple. One may think that this is intentionally misleading. Sure I can return in but that is not the point."
2,All or Nothing,"Agree with others that this plastic lock is cheaply made and would not really go far in securing valuables. It might, however, be a useful deterrent in some instances. I bought the lock hoping to be able to lock my refrigerator, but the loop on this lock does not adjust to different lengths."
2,unfortunately I got a lemon,"I never succeeded in getting the cable to retract properly. The little clutch thing wouldn't engage. Followed instructions to the letter. Called the help desk at Master Lock and they confirmed that mine was defective. Unfortunately I hadn't saved ordering information to get a refund. I need a lock that will withstand daily use, and may try the next model up."
1,Run away -- Farm & Home Supply won't resolve your issues!,"Farm & Home Supply would not resolve their own error, even though their change of the title (from ""locks"" to ""lock"") admits it was their error.I purchased this when the title said ""MASTER LOCK Retractable Cable Locks"" (as in more than one). I purchased assuming I get the 4 locks as shown in the picture.When I received one lock, I requested resolution by 1 of 3 options: 1) send me 3 more locks, 2) send me credit for the missing 3 locks, 3) I will return for FULL (price/ship) credit. They said NO to all of these.Now I have to go through an Amazon claim (which I'm actually looking forward to, because Amazon always does what is right).I'm amazed that Farm & Home Supply wouldn't resolve a stupid $15 issue!CharlieBTW, THE LOCK IS GREAT! I've used the 36in version and though I wouldn't trust it overnight with my bike, I do trust it when running into a grocery store, coffee shop, etc."
3,Snowboard lock,"I don't like that you are not able to select your color preference when you order this product. You are stuck with whatever color the company sends you. Luckily I got the color that I wanted. The look and feel of it is a bit cheap, but what do you expext for $8. I have not used it yet, but I do plan on using it next season."
3,"cute little dictionary, but only for beginners","Good things about this dictionary: Pocket-sized, great for travel. Quick lookup, because just gives you the basic definitions you would need as a BEGINNER.Bad things: Couldn't find a few words I needed (such as ""boyfriend"" and more slang-ish types of words). Only gives one or two possible translations for words that would have at least 10 definitions in an English dictionary. (Example: for the word ""miss"" they give you only two translations, for using with e.g. ""Miss Andersen"" and ""I miss you,"" but not for ""I missed the bus"" etc.)Get this dictionary only if you're a complete beginner, in which case it'll be very handy."
3,quite good for beginners,"This book is quite good for beginners, but not so good for scholars. It is good that it at least indicates pronunciation, in contrast to some Danish dictionaries, but the indication of pronunciation of Danish words is not so good as for English words, for example it does not indicate presence of the glottal stop. The dictionary claims to indicate only irregular plurals, which seems to mean change of vowel or doubling of consonants, but some Danish nouns have plurals in -e, others in -er, and this dictionary does not show which plural is used, whether -e or -er.The grammar section is too brief, it does not indicate for example how regular verbs are conjugated. But it has a good table of irregular verbs."
4,Well worth it!,"The Babylon translator is absolutely fantastic. My only wishes would be for it to have the Hebrew prepositions attached with the verbs, and to have vowels for correct pronunciations. It is very user friendly, offers distinctions between verbs, nouns or adjectives for the same word, etc. I would definitely recommend this to a friend, or anyone who is learning the Hebrew Language."
2,My mistake,I guess I misunderstood what this was. I thought it was one that spoke the words to help you speak them but it's not. It would have been really good if I already knew Hebrew.
2,Don't waste your time,"I purchased this movie because I love Lesley-Anne Down. She didn't have that big of a part, and it is super cheesy. Don't waste your time with this one."
5,Just What I Needed For My Reference Shelf!,"Can't believe this book actually exists. I have been waiting for a book that tells me in everyday terms things about natural healthcare. This practial guide is a must for the female population because it approaches a woman's life cycle from puberty and menstruation to senior health concerns. The section on menopause was extremely helpful. Going to highly recommend it to my reading club--SWER, Sisthas Who Enjoy Reading!"
2,nokia replacement battery,"I recentenly purchased 2 Nokia cell replacement batteries. After receiving the first one, it did not hold a charge well so, at the price, I ordered another. Neither hold a charge well. Must be old or seconds."
1,Dead after as few weeks,"I purchased the replacement batteries for the Nokia BCL-2 and found they were just slightly ""bigger"" than the official Nokia products, but as the batteries appeared to work well initially, it wasn't a big deal. But after a few weeks these (two) batteries began to lose their charge rapidly and provided only a few hours (three) of talk time and stand-by.Then the phone will signal ""dead battery"" and cut the call of NOW. I feel these batteries are OLD stock and I am the sucker that got stuck with them."
1,avoid like the plague,"This is obviously a counterfeit knockoff. Less than two months after installation, with less than five minutes use per week, the battery will not hold a charge for even 24 hours."
5,Wonderful story weaving,"Wooden Fish Songs is a fascinating story that weaves together the worlds 19th Century China, New England and the post-Civil War South. McCunn's extensive research makes this true story come alive and her talent makes the three women who tell the story real and believable. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Chinese literature and culture. This book portrays the difficult life not only for the Chinese immigrant in America, but also for the family left behind. I recommend this and any other of McCunn's works."
3,Invasion Gallifrey,"The Doctor lands the TARDIS on a spaceship, leaving Leela and K9 inside while he goes outside, meets with some aliens, and signs a treaty. He refuses to answer any questions from his companions, and directs the TARDIS to Gallifrey. The invasion of time has begun...The last story in Doctor Who's season fifteen, and the last with Leela as a companion, this story unfolds as it progresses. No-one in this story knows as much as they think they do, and this drives the story onwards.Particularly good in this story is the Doctor's previous teacher, Borusa, who is quite a bit of fun in his endeavours to act with appropriate dignity in different circumstances, while still playing a real and significant role.Terrance Dicks adaptation is fairly pedestrian, but the story is strong enough to survive this. The main problem, and not Mr. Dicks' fault, is the departure of Leela under what can only be described as lame circumstances."
4,"How I made $77 Million in 2 Years, and you can too.","Vincent James wrote this book from his own experience, he was wise before his time.I totally enjoyed and learn from his book and hope that I will be able to apply someof his knowledge to my business as well. Unfortunately the book I received was missingthe page from 105-114! How can I receive the rest of the pages or swap a complete book to me?"
4,Coby DVD Recorder that works...,"We had two other ""inexpensive"" dvd players that died recently and needed to replace them. This unit jumped out at me for three reasons, the ability to record to DVD, built-in TV tuner and the price. Setup was pretty simple and now the kids can watch their DVDs again. The recording quality of this unit is ""ok"". The unit has three different types of inputs: CABLE, RCA and S-Video, so it should work for most situtations. I gave the unit 4 stars, because it is not a high-priced or high-quality system and it met my low to medium quality device expectations."
1,didn't work out,"This Coby product arrived defective: power would come on but unit would not function. Otherwise, Coby products are great and this unit would have had great ""bang for the buck"". In fact, after reading the manual I have to say that this product would have been too advanced for this user."
4,Aceptable por el precio,"Hace unos dias compre este modelo aprovechando el excelente precio, y por supuesto luego de ver algunos ""reviews"". Es mi primer DVD recorder, por tanto, no tengo ninguna referencia. Pero en general, hace lo que quiero: grabar programas de la tv (el tuner funciona bien) y grabar el monton de mini DV tapes que tengo tomados con mi camara sony. Me parece excelente esta funcion, con la entrada DV. Mi unica queja ahora ahora es el control remoto, poco alcance y necesita que este direccionado exactamente hacia el sensor. Ademas, no siempre responde."
3,Retrospective...,This track brings back the glory days of disco...when Michael Jackson had the ruffled shirt and the tight tuxedo....Where did the spirit of dance go? It is in this song..it gets you hype..only reason I didn't give it a higher mark..is because the drum track sounds just like Mousse T..(I'm Horny)..overall good song..
5,In the spirit of Borland,"Jean Hersey, born in 1902 and living in the Eastern United States, in Pennsylvania and Connecticut, was a prolific writer of magazine articles for Woman’s Day and various gardening and houseplant periodicals. She also authored something like a dozen non-fiction books dealing with gardening, homemaking, and semi-rural life."
4,Good Book on an Interesting topic,"Mannix does a great job of making you feel like you are a part of the crowd at a Roman spectacle. His descriptions of chariot races and gladiator games are well done. He takes real gladiators, whose name has been recorded in history, and creates a ""biography"" and career for him. The only knock on the book is that some of the themes are adult in nature. Otherwise, it is a great insight into our times as well as those of ancient Rome. Good companion piece to the movie Gladiator."
3,A solid read but not fantastic,"If I'm reading the inside cover properly this is a pretty old book (1958) which I guess has been re-released to cash in on the ""Gladiator"" movie phenomenon. I found it engaging in parts and slow in others but like other reviewers I found it hard to come to terms with either poorly described or non-existent reference to the historical sources these events were supposedly based on. Only in the last chapter did I get a feeling from the sources quoted that ""yes, this sounds like it did actually happen"". Unfortunately I walk away from much of the rest of the book thinking that at best it is speculation and possibly just fiction. I quite enjoy historical fiction but I prefer to know that's what it is when I sit down to read it. On a positive note it moves fairly quickly and is an enjoyable, easy read."
3,A decent addition to the series,"A dealer in rare films (Norman Reedus) hunts for a rare movie that is rumored to induce madness and violence in anyone who sees it.This is a pretty decent entry in the Masters of Horror series. Director John Carpenter and screenwriters Drew McWeeney and Scott Swan establish an effective mood and the ultimate nature of the film is suitably disturbing, but the plot machinations are a bit creaky. We are led through an underground film scene that is a bit silly in its excesses and we are given gore when something more psychologically unsettling is called for. Still, this film is superior to most of the entries in the series that I have seen so far."
2,Mixed,It had some bizarre things in it but overall it was so so. The whole premise of the Le Fin de la monde is not that bad. It was just made a bit too cheesy for what it is. Normally I can like Carpenter when he's cheesy but not this one for some reason.
2,"Too Much Gore, Not Enough Originality","Instead of a television signal that induces a tumor in the viewer;s brain, driving him mad and inducing all kinds of mayhem (David Cronenberg's VIDEODROME), we have here an old, once-seen movie that drove the audience mad and induced all sorts of bloodshed. The protagonist, on the trail of the movie, encounters one unpleasant episode after the other, which, instead of building tension, turns out to be monotonous. Although John Carpenter did good work on THE THING and IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS, this Master of Horror runs out of steam at about 10 minutes into its 58-minute run time."
2,Cigarette burns is just ok,"I was disappointed by this masters of horror episode. I guess i expected more from a director like John Carpenter.There were some scary moments and a bunch of gore, even some music reminiscent of carpenter's older Halloween score, but I found myself thinking the acting was highly subpar and the story was getting more and more far fetched as we went along. It's better than other stuff out there but I'm not sure that is saying much."
1,Please enter a title for your review,"Fashionably incomprehensible. How much you enjoy this film will probably directly correpsond to how much you enjoy namedropping. The worst in the series and as much of waste of time to watch as any movie ever has been. I don't think I've ever seen a movie with such an uneventful plot that is so hard to follow. Characters are never adequately introduced or established, there is no suspense, and nothing in it has any relevence to horror other than a realistic looking beheading which isn't even clear whether it really happened or if it was a dream sequence, and a ridiculous scene at the end of a guy feeding his intestines into the wheels of a film projector. I'm almost surprised that this episode was even aired, rather than the producers just cutting their losses and canning it to save their audience the annoyance of trying to find anything of worth in it."
2,Neither Scary Nor Interesting,"Having just finished the movie moments ago, I thought I would write my review. I bought it based on the high recommendations and reviews I saw here on Amazon, but the movie did not live up to my expectations.Here's the thing- it could have been an awesome, scary movie. It didn't quite make it. Instead we have fake blood, poor acting, cheesy dialog, and we never actually get to see Le Fin de la Monde, the movie that the film is about. I wanted to like it. I thought it was a great premise- the idea that good or evil could actually be captured on film in a life changing way. But the execution was poor and I wasn't convinced. I would actually love to see a remake, longer with more thought put into the story line."
1,decorating with flea market finds,I found nothing but nice pictures to view in this book. I do alot of flea market decorating and there was nothing I could use. Ideas are mentioned in very brief text. A nice coffee table book but not an informative decorating source.
1,Disappointed,I love to read and I was looking forward to reading this book based on the great reviews especially since I'm a new mom. It was much thinner than I expected. I started reading it and I just couldn't get into it. I didn't find it that humerous either. Very disappointed so I returned it.
1,Nothing to do with Khayyam!,"I bought this audiobook through audible, because I thought the speaker would read the Robayyat of Khayyam with a pleasant music behind. Instead this Swami, who nobody knows, attached all his garbage upon things Khayyam never said or thought, showing that likely he never understood Khayyam at all (and I don't believe he read it!).But most of all it is not understandable why he needed to use the name of Khayyam for something which is totally not related, since he speaks of reincarnation, different lives, break the cycle of reincarnation.I don't believe it is fair for someone who wants to read about Khayyam and his poems, to buy something which he/she wouldn't buy if the name of Khayyam was not used.Using an analogy it is like if someone would buy an audiobook of the Divine Comedy by Dante, and inside there is a guy who speak of Marxism, it has nothing to do with it!"
4,Great tool for the Microsoft web developer,"If you are into developing for NT, you need this book. It has a bit of everything, from standard ASP objects to a rather full explanation of ADO for ASP in a web-based application. It is not a book for beginners necessarily, but most of the material is written out well enough for anyone with any coding experience.The biggest downfall is the organization of the book. Not that the organization of the book is bad (it isn't), but the first edition was much better."
2,For dummies and those who want real long and redundant infos,"I would suggest this book for folks only who are real beginners. For those who have been programming VB or C++ before or did some MS Access programming, this becomes pretty boring after you read 10%. A lot of information is overhead, too long and useless information. BTW: For those who are useing Win95/98 or NT Workstation can use PWS only, so at least 50% of the book it useless because you would need IIS, and therefore NT Server (e.g. for SMTP)."
2,Too much junk,"I bought this book on the recommendations of the reviewers on this site, but I must say I was gravely disappointed. Horrible, unclear presentation, tiny font, and just a lot of junk which I do not find useful. I suggest you read it in a bookstore before considering buying this expensive book."
5,Great book for web developers already familiar with ASP,I bought this book after reading several strong book reviews about it and was not disappointed. Its a very well designed and comprehensive book - the authors went to a great extent to make this the perfect bok on learning advanced ASP once you've mastered the basics. I'm a college student but after learning ASP at work the hard way I think this ASP Bible should be on every Web Developer's bookshelf. Even the appendices are very useful serving as a quick refresher for various topics from how to configure DSNs and setting up virtual directory for ASP applications to a concise VBScript and JScript language reference. Thanks to all the authors!
5,Great reference! Highly recommended.,"If you only have one ASP reference, this is the one to buy. All the text I have read is clear and concise, with lots of good examples. The appendices themselves are worth most of the purchase price."
4,"Pretty darned good book..A little verbose, but very good..","I liked this book. My boss bought this book for me. I just got into the programming world about 2 years ago, and continue to work with SQL server and VB. This book has taught me a lot about the overall design of systems in addition to the asp examples ! I havn't read the whole book, but I think it should have added some more examples about a typical shop that might use such things as Windows 95 in a small network such as windows 95 along with an Access databases, but I guess there isn't much of an audiance for this ...Over all the reading of this book has been excellent. Now I have decided to buy the first book.."
5,Excellent,"Let me be honest, I hate programming, I don't like anything to do with the web, and the internet, but hey, it's good money right? and besides it's nice when you can add 'programming experience' to your resume. So I bought this book, at first it doesn't look too anything, but when I began reading I realized that the reason I hated it so much had to do with the fact that I didn't understand anything there, this books got me started and now I am an advanced programmer. I would like to recommend any book from Wrox publishing, it's all good!"
5,THIS IS THE BEST ASP BOOK FOR BEGINNERS and VETERANS!,"This is the third ASP I bought and the last until Wrox publishes the next edition. The other ASP book I purchased were filled with fluff, this book is full of great examples and is comprehensive. A definite ""must have"" for all asp'ers."
4,Very easy to read,"I needed to get a leg up on ASP fast, and this book got me through my first web project. It's not everything you'll need, but for server-side scripting on IIS, this is what you'll find on the desk of many developers. There's a new edition out for 3.0, so if you're working on IIS5 get that one."
5,Absolutely OUSTANDING AND COMPREHENSIVE!!!!,"This book is well put together, well organized and also is jammed packed with information on the latest and greatest technology (i.e. ActiveX, ASP, MTS, and much much more). I highly recommend this book!"
3,Definitely not for beginners.,First of all this book is not for beginners because it doesn't help in anyway as to how to install PWS on your PC and the examples are good but some of them have no output.The author skips from VBSript to JScript with no prior explanation.Not a great book to buy but if anybody has it you can use it as a reference.
4,Good in comparision,"The quality of ASP books is generally poor for anything but the simplist books, which makes the Wrox book the best of a bad breed.Book is weak on showing how to debug a component in IIS and MTS. It should go through a debugging session.ASP 3.0 is now available."
5,if you want to build a web APPLICATION -- buy this book,"Active Server Pages technology rocks! This is the easiest way to harness web database power. Turn your clients' web sites into interactive WEB APPLICATIONS today. Learn how to easily use built-in web server objects to pass data between your web pages, and to and from your server using Request, Response, Application, and Session.

1,Don't Buy This Book If You Are Working With JavaScript!!!,The examples in this book do not work. The book states that it is for VBScript and JavaScript but most of the important examples are in VBScript. Chapter 4 does NOT have a single line of code in JavaScript!!! The book has errors. On page 154 it states to use the CreateObject for FileSystemObject in JavaScript but it doesn't work. I check the Microsoft help and it should be ActiveXObject instead. The book was not well writen. There probably is a better ASP book out there.
3,Worth buying but you better have some patience,There is nothing more frustrating than trying to learn from an example that doesn't work! It seems that there has been ample time to correct the problems in the downloaded chapter samples. My objective is to put a database on an Intranet and for this I will have to purchase yet another book. There is alot of good information in here and making the examples work is a good exercise once you learn the basics somewere else.
2,Too much VBScript!,"Way too much VBScript was used in the examples. If you want to use JavaScript in your ASP code do NOT get this book. There is only enough JavaScript to let the authors get away with saying the book uses it. Also, one or more of these authors has horrendous English because it reads like someone who speaks with broken English. I wasted my money (and time!) on this book."
4,Worth the time and effort in the long run,"This book suffers from the same problems of all large collaborative efforts: fragmentation, inconsistancy and confusion (on the reader's part). However, if you can get past that, taking it a chunk at a time, it is truly an excellant guide to ASP. The book is overly reliant on VBScript examples even when it claims to give equal time to JScript, and does gloss over some of the database interaction. However, the case studies in the last 1/3 of the book are invalvuable learning tools."
2,Have You Tried the E-commerce Case Study?,I bought this book and found out there's an E-Commerce case study. It does not work and the techo support was not helpful.
1,One of The Worst,"I really can't believe people actually like this book! It is disorganized, frought with fragmented information, and lacks the professional information it's title would imply! Do yourself a favor, do not buy this book."
3,"Average. Learn stuff, but Learn from O'rielly books better","I liked the book. Much of what I like is redundant with O'reilly's ASP in a nutshell book though. I don't really like the teaching component that much. I have a hard time integrating the details into the big picture, mostly becuase of example inconsitancy - sometimes they go overboard with examples, with very little text support, sometimes their's barely any examples. I like SQL Developers' guide (I don't Know the other Mc-Graw-Hill books, this was the first one I read). That and the O'reilly nutshell books I learn from best. I also have 2 other O'reilly books that I like alot too."
2,Iolani or Tahiti As it Was A Romance,This book was very difficult to understand because it is written in difficult english with many big words. I didnt understand what it meant until i read reviews amd summaries of it. I wouldnt recomend it unless you want to be constantly looking up words in the dictionary.
5,Happy with the Antec Phantom 500,I was happy to find how easy it was to purchase the antec Phantom 500. It was the same price as the auction sites and i didnt have to worry about warrentees or pay delays. Thank you Amazon for making this product available and I hope you will continue to have more items for sale! :)
4,Warning:,"This album was named ""Roger Taylor Talks"", but actually, the speaker is Freddie.He was speaking through all of 15 mins.But I like this album, because it looks very lovely!Great stuff for fans.-Which shaped CD is real Roger's interview?"
3,Be Careful,"This book covers all of the Linux objectives for the CompTIA exam but all but ignores the hardware objectives. Teh Linux+ exam has many detailed hardware questions including stuff like IRQ assignments that are simply not found in this book. I passed this test using this book but I recently wrote my A+ exam. If I had not, I would not have passed with this book alone. Definately do not use this book as your only study guide."
2,Needed more on the hardware side.,"This book is not that bad for understanding Linux, but it is very weak on the hardware side of the exam. 19% of the Linux+ exam is on hardware and this book pretty much left if all out.I wish Sybex would check the objectives with the text to make sure everything is there. If you are using this book for the Linux+ exam make sure you pick up another book that does not leave out the hardware section. Happy Studying."
1,"9"" skillet by la creuset",I was a little disappointed. I thought it would be better than my seasoned cast iron & non stick pans and its not. I have regular cast iron by lodge that is much better. I will not buy any more.
4,Everything an enameled cast iron skillet should be,"It works well, and enables some kinds of cooking to be gone with elegance. I use it for frittatas frequently. It isn't as easy to clean as a seasoned plain cast iron skillet, but in general, that isn't much of a black mark, because it still cleans with considerable ease. It looks great, better than a plain cast iron skillet. I also use it for pork chops and other things that can stand high heat. I'm glad I have it, along with other enameled cast iron items."
3,Any region hack for US-bought DMRE85HS?,"One sticking point for me now is if it can play other region, e.g. Asia. My US DMRE85HS from Amazon is on its way. I just realized there may not be any region hack after I did some research. It appears there is a hack remote from UK for European version to make it multi-region. However, the maker indicated I can not use it on US DMRE85HS to view Asia DVD. Any one knows a work-around? Much obliged!!!"
1,Do Not Buy this product!,"After finally deciphering the product manual, I found this unit fun to operate, probably 'cause of the excitement over a new toy. I bought this unit mainly to record old VHS tapes to DVD. I had recorded about 12 hours of vhs tapes onto the hard drive and had started to edit by creating titles, erasing commercials, etc. when the unit froze up and wouldn't respond to the commands in the manual. I exchanged the machine for another of the same model. Again, with about 18 hours of material on the hard drive, I began the editting process once again. And once again, the unit froze and wouldn't respond to commands to rectify the situation as stated in the manual. Called Panasonic, they knew from nothing. Returned this product for a full refund. Both units had only been in use for 2 days before shutting down."
2,"Great advertising, but, short on honesty","Were I to do it again, I would save myself several hundred dollars and insure the unit does not have the TV Guide BS. The hard drive recording sounds good, but what Panasonic does not tell you is: you MUST set up the TV Guide system, even if you do not have this feature, in order to use the manual timer recording; you will be without a television for 24 hours, if all your cable goes through a cable box while the recorder attempts to download the TV Guide; you can manually set up channels (although the set up guide gives poor instructions on doing this) but still not be able to timer record. It plays and records beautifully, but, I think better satisfaction could be had for less money."
3,Maybe another lemon,"Well, I love the machine, except it crashes more than an old windows 95 machine. What happens to me almost daily is the ONSCREEN menus do not fade out properly and a jumbled color overlay of the TVGUIDE menu is left. It requires a complete reboot of the machine, then it seems to work ok. I will point out that I DO NOT have anything on the machine or near it to block it from proper cooling. No idea why the unit does this. I would like to hear from overs who have the unit longer. Maybe I should consider returning it.If it didnt ""crash"" all the time 4 or 5 stars for sure."
1,Mine broke down 2 times for less than a year.,"The reason I chose Panasonic DVD recorder over other brand is that product is still made in Japan. Most of other DVD recorders now are made in China. I really fell in love with it when I first received it. This is my dream machine I have been yearning a long time ago, so I can retire my vcr. But six months later the machine broke down, I took it to Panasonic to have it service. The machine is still under guaranteed so I don't have to pay anything. Panasonic has good service. And a week ago my machine broke down again. I don't know if I can trust Panasonic DVD recorder anymore."
3,TV Guide On Screen Does Not Work,"Despite hours spent trying to correct the problem with technical support people (at TV Guide On Screen), I have never been able to download the programming data to my unit. The tech support person was very patient and friendly, but this function of the unit has never worked. My cable provider does provide the information, but the machine can't accurately read it.Every other aspect of the unit seems very good. Picture quality, ease of dubbing from hard disk to DVD, total capicity of hard disk... all good. The remote is easy to use. Ability to ""slip time"", ie, watch a program from the beginning even though the program is still being recorded, is a very nice feature of this (and other digital recording) unit.However, I must manually input recording parameters (time, station, duration...) since TV Guide doesn't work."
2,"Great in the beginning, but you will end up unhappy","From the minute we setup this unit, we fell in love with it. The progressive scan playback was supurb, the remote was well made and functional and the TV guide worked fine for us after the 24 hr wait time per the manual.After a couple of weeks, we noticed that you could not exit the TV guide as it would be ""stuck"" on the screen. As others said, you had to unplug the unit even to get it to work. Well this continued to the point where it was not usable anymore.I tried calling Panasonic, but didn't want to wait the time on the phone. I'm VERY glad I bought it from Amazon because they took it back with no questions asked and are refunding my money.It's really too bad that this unit has issues. Since most of these components are integrated, I would not risk getting one of these and ""hope"" it works since repair of the unit isn't really an option. Either it works or it doesn't."
5,Great DVR with high speed burn to DVD capability,"I absolutely love this unit. I got it a number of years ago and it is still in service. It records to the internal hard drive with a touch of a button, and if you have the high speed setting turned on - then later you can copy the program to a DVD very quickly. Its relatively easy to cut out commercials too - just mark the begining spot and the end spot, split the video and delete the middle segment. I've done this for many shows I've recorded and wanted to keep for a while on the DVR without the commercials.It has over the air TV Guide, but this service was discontinued in my area so the channel listings no longer contain program title and information. It plays DVDs, CDs, and switches between HDD and disc mode with the touch of a button."
4,An Amazing Machine,"Pros: Tivo like system, editing capabilities, and easy to use.Cons: Manual could use some work and editing capabilities could be improved a bit.What an amazing machine. I bought this just to transfer some home movies to DVD. Having the 120GB HDD (Hard Disk Drive) is great to store hours of TV programing thats on to late. Not to menchin its a wounderful place to edit out some of those ""user errors"" while running the camcorder. When recording from the camcorder to the HDD or DVD its as simple as pressing a button. All and all, once you figure the basics out, its a really easy operation. For me personally, I wish this came in black. Oh-well."
3,Good Machine until hard drive crashed,"Have had the DMR85 for 8 months now. Relatively pleased with its performance. Drawbacks mentioned by others not that big of a deal until the HDD on mine crashed. Lost several programs I wanted to keep, but hadn't burned yet. In the repair shop right now. A little leary because of the long repair times mentioned by others.Will update on my repair experience.Took a couple of weeks because of problems getting parts, but the unit has worked great since being repaired. It wasn't the HDD, but a circuit board that went bad. Not a perfect machine, but then who makes a perfect one? Overall, very pleased with it. No one seems to be making Recorders with HDD's much anymore, so i'm glad I have two of these. I would upgrade the unit to 4 stars."
3,Great when it works,I purchased my unit in December and had relatively no problems until March. It turns out there are some known problems Panasonic is addressing. My unit has been at the repair shop for about a month. Very responsive Customer service when you speak to the right person. It appears the TV Guide/Gemstar had done a patch on their software that caused all sorts of problems for this unit. Supposedly this has been addressed and is fixed/being fixed. My units TV Guide would not activate each morning unless I physically unplugged the unit. There was an upgraded firmware as well as some of the units would not completely reset (pressing power button for several seconds) Another way to reset (soft reset) is to press channel up and down at the same time. These are some of the things I have learned with this unit. My unit is due back on Friday and I will update this review once I get to thoroughly test the unit.
2,BEWARE if you are in Denver/Boulder - no TV Guide listings,"I have owned this unit for nearly two years, have called customer support several times (they are friendly and fairly knowledgeable) and have never been able to use TV Guide listings because of an apparent incompatibility with Comcast's signal and this unit. Now, I can ""rent"" a DVR unit from Comcast that DOES work with their TV Guide signal (a Panasonic even!) but I dislike the idea of getting rid of this unit after investing a decent amount of $$ into it. If it weren't for this major problem, I'd be very happy with the unit."
1,Very poor product,"I own the DMR-E85H and have experienced many frustrations with it.1) You can only schedule 8 shows. What is the point of having such a large recording capacity when you can't record all that you want?2) When adding a 9th show to be recorded one of the first 8 is randomly deleted. Be careful or you will miss your favorite shows.3) Sometimes a show is just deleted from your recording schedule for no apparent reason. Forget about setting it and forget it, if you want something recorded you have better check that it actually is.All this really is to me is an overpriced DVD player.Even though it hasn't broken like so many others listed in here, it doesn't even come close to the potential it could of had if Panasonic actually put any thought into it."
3,what I think,"1. It hates spindled dvd's ,you know the cheap ones, it will not record on them , I have tried several different brands If it comes on a spindle forget it.2. Its unbelieveably complex, I don't mind it but if you have any problem using a VCR this is not the product for you.3. Its not designed to work with a satelite box , like dish,or direct tv, it is set up to work with a cable box.4. The Lowest quality for recording , the 8 hour mode is almost unusable , I am willing to compromise on video quality more than most will be but the 8 hour mode is truly terrible almost useless even on a small screen where you notice it less.Over all I like it , the price was fair and it seems to work like it should"
1,U99 Error Messages,"I, too, have had many problems with this unit since it was purchased in January 2005. I've called Panasonic so many times that I don't even bother any more because the wait is so long and they are absolutely no help and sometimes even rude. They ask the same questions over and over until I actually start feeling intimidated. They assume everything that you report is YOUR error, not the recorder's. Now the U99 message pops up randomly and resetting according to the Owner's Manual does no good - it just happens again, so we never get any listings. Panasonic did refer me to a ""local"" dealer for repair, but the ""local"" dealer happens to be over 100 miles away. Big help. Buy another recorder."
1,Can't change time,"I have owned this guy for four months with many of the problems mentioned by others here. I am ready to throw it out. I just found out today from Panasonic customer support that you cannot change the time, it only updates through TV Guide which they claim no support for. I am using DirecTV connection only and without a cable or antenna it will not update or let me change the time. What an excellent design! (Not)."
4,Another good single by TRU,Samples Ill be there but this is still a good single by Tru not Hoody Hoo are the classic Bout it Bout it but this is probally there 3rd best single and this is worth a couple of Listens.Lyrics 7/10 Production 8/10 Overall 7.5/10
2,"This ""book"" is really a 27-page long pamphlet.","I am a huge fan of Kreeft--I've read and listened to him many times, and even gotten him to sign a book for me. Unfortunately, I was disappointed in this offering. Although I only ordered a quantity of one, I was shipped 5 copies of this pamphlet (I believe the 5 copies is a quantity of one). The pamphlet itself is a typical Kreeft-styled dialogue between Sonny (whose Catholic faith is bright) and Dusty (who has drifted from the Church). Although the pamphlet briefly gives excellent reasons to re-examine lost faith, it caters to ""Mere Christianity"", not Catholicism. The title might lend one to think that Kreeft was going to explore the Holy Mother Church, but not here. Overall, this is not quite up to par for Kreeft."
3,Pacesetter Headers,I baught this item and had them professionally installed. The ball flanges leak really bad so exhaust shop had to cut them off and put new ones on. Good product but be prepared to spend a little extra cash on new flanges.
2,Good book but dated,"Started reading this book today and at first thought it may be a good read but it didn't take long for me to realize that the book was 'very' dated. The book was making refs to things you could do once the .net server is released. That only the beta version was being used during the time of writing. The first version of the .Net server was released in Feb of 2002. I guess I should have paid attention to the publishing date (August 13, 2002) for this book. As I kept reading though the book I was finding many things that were dated and, in many cases, no longer in use. I didn't want to spend my time going over old technology and having to parse through what is still relevant today. I'll remember to pay attention to the publishing dates from now on."
4,First Dvd Recorder,"This is the first dvd recorder I've owned. I basicly wanted to burn my old vcr tapes and record from the TV. The Sharp DV-SR3U records dvd-r,dvd-rw discs. Rewritable discs can be recorded in video and VR mode.DVD-RW recorded in the VR mode can be edited after recording,but will only playback on this machine. The dvd-r, dvd-rw(video mode) seem to play in most standard players. The operation manual is 100 pages, well written, but somewhat complicated for a non-tech person. I don't like the flip open remote, but most often used keys are on top. Easy to set up timer recording from TV. Overall this is an excellent recorder and fulfills my needs!"
1,Shop around before you buy,"We have had our Sharp DVD player/recorder for a year and we are now having problems with it. First of all, the ""open/close"" takes about one minute before opening. Secondly, I have had many brand new, out of the box DVDs to lock up on the screen in the middle of a movie and then I have to literally unplug the DVD player, then plug it back to eject the DVD, which takes exactly one minute to do. It is more trouble than it is worth. Don't waste your money on this particular brand....shop around and ask around before purchasing."
1,The WORST,"I have 4 DVD recorders.I have 3 Panasonics (great machines) & wanted a 4th but because of the IR remote I was limited to 3.So I needed another brand and SHARP had a good price (it seemed, incorrectly)so I got the SHARP.It is an amazing BAD machine.It doesn't work correctly and getting it fixed is a nightmare. I just sent it back for the second time,it returned today and they fixed NOTHING.It is a true Nightmare,STAY AWAY!!!"
5,We're All Romantics,"Loved this book. Wonderfully perceptive for a young man. Accurate and analytical while retaining a delicious sense of humor. This book should be mandatory reading for every 18 year old and the18 year old in all of us.The Romantic Movement is a simple and refreshing look at the relationship quagmire we all find ourselves in at some point of our lives. No psycho babble here just straight forward narrative that we can all empathize with. In the end, a better understanding of our needs, whims and idiosyncrasies all rendered in a amusing manner."
2,His worst novel,This novel reads like a pot boiler after On Love. The format and themes are identical but the inspiration of the former work is lacking. The characters are unappealing spoiled brats fail to arouse the empathy De Botton probably intends.De Botton integrates the thoughts of great writers into his story. At times his parallels are farfetched and one gets the impression that he is merely parading his classical education. These pedantic displays can also be annoying.
5,Frothy title doesn't do justice,"First rate writing by Alain de Botton takes a philosopher's view of sex/romance/communication between upper middle class, witty, heterosexual couples in their late 20s (i.e., one woman and her relationships w/ men). Anyone who can take romantic comedy, written in delicious prose, and infuse it w/ Wittgenstein and straightforward psychological insight gets my vote. Lots of fun and one can learn useful info about the quandaries some relationships pose."
3,Could have gone further...,"Definetely the author could have gone deeper . The subject deserves it and his eloquence should demand it. At the end, unfortunately, there is not so much to take from the book but for the empathy for the drama lived by the female character -- quite familiar to women of the 90s."
5,A fantastic love story,"Quite the best study of male-female relationships I have ever read. De Botton is a masterful analyst of human emotions, and happens also to write like an angel"
3,faeries surround us all the time,"yeah, it's kinda interesting, and it gives you a slice of insight into her world. it portrays her as being somewhat flighty and aloof, talking about (literal) faeries and such.but the thing about it is, i know she has some real stories to tell. tales about her life, the inspiration behind the songs, dealings with record labels, relationships, band members, family, being on tour, or whatever else, makes this feel a little trite.so i guess we'll wait for the VH1 documentary.dig it.Axel"
2,Cute until you turn it on,We bought our daughter the entire Snug As A Bug bedding set. If you are interested in the rest of the set I would say go for it but skip the nightlight. The rest of the set is wonderful. Very cute and durable. My daughter is 2 1/2 and it's held up great.This was the only item we were disappointed in. We had to return it. It's really cute until you switch on the light. Then you can see the paint splotches where some areas are thicker than others and you can't even make out what it is. It just looks like a blob of colors. I was very sad to have to return it and get something else.
2,Not too much functional,The lamp is beautiful but it doesnt light! It is probably because of the material that does not allow the light pass through
3,Too bright!!,"This nightlight is cute, but too bright! It's made of thin painted plastic. When it is on, it is impossible to tell what it is, and the glow from baby's room looks like we've left the light on!"
3,Mickey nite lite review,"The night light arrived in perfect condition. I was under the impression that it was black in color like Mickey's ears, however it is actually navy blue in color. It doesn't coordinate with my decorations now. I was a little disappointed, but not enough to send it back. It would cost way too much to send it back. The shipping to get it here was as much as the night light itself."
3,"Cute, not super functional","I bought this for my son's room and it's adorable, but not terribly bright. It gives off just enough light, but it nowhere near as bright as the lights in my other children's rooms."
3,Cute but cheap,"Larger than I expected. When it is lit up, it looks like it was painted and you can see where the paint is thin. Sheds a decent amount of light but if you are looking for a bright nightlight things is not it."
4,Very cute,We like this a lot. It matches all the Happi Tree bedding. It puts out a dim light and its pretty.
1,Night light???,"I was looking for a dim night light, but barely any light could shine through. Very cute, but way too dark."
2,Nightlight looks terrible,"I was really excited to get this item in my baby's nursery. I thought it was the cutest little nightlight ever! However, when I went to plug it in, I was severely disappointed! There are dark spots on the inside on the bear that show through when you plug it in. Therefore, I will not be using this as a nightlight cause it looks very crappy! I still think the bear is cute sitting on his shelf, but he's not as cute as the price I paid for him. :("
2,Cute when off...,"This nightlight is adorable, when the light is off! I was disappointed when I plugged it in that 1) it is a switch light (does not come on when it senses it is dark) 2) when the light is on you can see that the paint is not even and 3) It is not very bright."
5,better than photo!,"Thsi photo doesn't do the product justice. It's a blue yellow (true yellow, not the orangy look in the photo) and green design. very intricate. It's smaller than I imagined it. It's the perfect size for a large layered dip or maybe a hot artichoke dip, or tray of crackers. Good price and beautiful like all polish pottery. Has the castle stamp on the bottom."
1,Sad,"When I received the CD there was no CD in the case, even so it was plastic wrapped. Quite disapointing!"
3,"Good, but not great.",This product is good to maintain white teeth. The breath freshener is not that great. I would not rely on this product alone for white teeth or fresh breath.
2,Supersmile Whitening Quikee,These didn't work for me. It made my gums burn too bad to keep using it. So I won't be buying it again.
1,Sunna's first release,Some strange heavy territory. Watch out for the track with the hooky xylaphone (spelling?) - about life through child's eyes.
4,Nice Family Movie,"I thought this was a nice movie about family life and growing up, nothing indecent and no bad language that I can recall picking up on. I purchased this movie as a gift for someone that is a real animal lover. I know some people in other reviews worried about explaining euthanasia of the dogs to their children but I think it's something they need to know about and be aware that this really happens in this world and I feel this would be a good teaching moment for the child to learn that they can make a difference when they decide to stand up for something. I did think the acting was kinda weak for an adult viewer, these aren't major celebrities here, and yes maybe that of a made-for-tv movie, but that it was still well done and heartfelt. I felt it had a good storyline with a tear-jerking happy ending. I liked it."
3,A review,Iwould recommend this as an excellent family movie emphasizing relationships and strains within families and the love and devotion to all creatures small and large. Beautifully. filmed with a group of talented performers and a final act for Peter Boyle.
5,A Must Buy Movie!!!!!,"This movie is truly inspiring and true. Yes, it had dark elements, but the elements are presented in a way that you can relate to in everyday life and great for the entire family. The movie was shot in Kansas City (which is in Missouri!) and hopefully this paves the way for more and more films to be created in this beautiful city. I travel a lot and you'd be surprised how many people believe the main Kansas City is actually in Kansas...there is a Kansas City, Kansas in actuality...but it's very, very small in comparison. How 'bout that...a little geographic lesson in a movie review. Much like many life lessons in this movie...buy it today!"
3,a moving family movie,"A teenage girl have trouble dealing with the death of her mother.She lets loose her Dad's ( town dog catcher) pound animalsand gets in real trouble.She gets ""farmed out"" to her grandfather who is a crusty oldhorse trader.The combination of animal rights, dogs and horsesends up with the creation of a new way.I didn't really like the movie much,but it appears to be one that you can take your family too."
2,dougv,"The excellent cover photo for the dvd made the film look appealing, but themovie is slow moving and mostly boring. About a third of the movie needs to beedited out. A number of times I almost shut it off.The music is good, but the acting is mediocre.When the child goes to live with her grandfather, you see the value of work &praise to help a child be happier. Earlier she was very angry and unhappy.Near the end of the film the girl was allowed to boss the grandfather around,making her look superior and the grandfather look stupid -- too much of this intoday's films and TV shows.Overall, the movie is not worth seeing."
4,Extremely Happy,It's a great movie. It arrive just a few days after ordering it and it was in excellent condition.
1,"Movie typical of Hollywood, U.S.A.",This movie had great actors and a lot of promise. The script writers wrecked the plot about half way through the movie. Belle (Vivien Cardone) is an misguided teenager because she believes her father spoke to the doctors and approved of euthanasia. Later she finds out this is not the case. This is one of your typical Hollywood movies today which show parents and even grandparents aren't too bright and the children are the only ones all-the-brains. By the end of the movie she has pretty much showed everyone their life mistakes and made the world a great place. Not a good movie to show your children sends the wrong message concerning parent-children interactions.
5,Simply exquisite!,"The Caran d'Ache Retro pens are some of the most elegant ones I've ever owned. The rhodium coating never seems to scuff or wear --- it's like ""affordable platinum.""This is NOT a ""hey, can I borrow your pen"" pen.The maker's refills are some of the smoothest ball-pen ones around --- like writing with fine lipstick. BUT --- these pens will also accept Fisher Space Pen refills! Perhaps not as elegant, but that does pack function into a deceptively slender package.Liked mine so much I gave on to my wife."
3,Weak Special Effects detract from average sci-fi movie,"3 of 5 stars to this average sci-fi movie. Set late in WWII, some ancient eggs are discovered which hatch to deliver a few hundred flying dinosars. A bomber is forced to land on that island and you can pretty much guess the rest. Below average special effects with composite shots that look obviously composited. Too many bad composites. Oh, did I mention the bomber has an A-bomb on-board? Wanna guess the ending?"
3,THE GREATEST GENERATION,"I liked it.So did my father,a World War 11 veteran.He was awarded the silver Star for bravery and if any generation could defeat prehistoric creatures,THEY COULD!He told me the uniforms,firearms,holsters,vehicles,etc.were all authentic. Even the women's hair-do's.Someone did their homework.I liked the idea of women heroes and wished for more character development,though. I liked the tall woman whose plane crashed when the Pteranodon landed on it.Wish she lived.I realize this is a low budget affair and special effects were very good even so.I liked the sky colors(background) when the B-29 was in flight.I never heard of the stars and they did a good job and the film had a good pace to it.Maybe a sequel,where some of the pteranodons survived and mutated form the atomic blast?"
4,Warbirds... not what you think!,"I got a DVD of this movie from a friend as a gift and watched it, and afterward I knew I had to buy one for one of my friends to pass along!! It's a little over the top with the acting but it is a FUN movie. This movie reminded me of; ""The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra"" but with so much better effects! Same over the top acting but with a strong storyline and special effects to keep you entertained.I would rate and put this one in me ""B"" movies selection, so if you like ; Fun, Campy over the Top movies with a hint of the 1960's feel try this one out!"
2,Amusingly Preposterous,1940's women aviators. Nasty flying dinos. Battle of the sexes. Atomic bomb detonation. Pangs of conscience. Two survivors. Enough said.
2,Mystery of the blue whale,While the movie had beautiful scenes in it most of it was in a foriegn lanaguage with no sub titles. I was very disappointed and I did not see this when I was purchasing the movie for a small child who loves Blue Whales.
4,vintage quest,Trying to find books published mid 20th century is a journey in itself; so grateful to have stumbled upon just what I was looking for my mama. Timely shipping and sturdy packaging!
2,"Transfer excellent, dryer survivability poor.","As a one-shot, or for making shirts that you don't mind line drying, these transfers seem to be excellent. Following the application instructions, I had a nice, clean transfer on the first try.However, following the wash/dry instructions provided (wait at least 24 hours to clean, wash in cold water, dry on a warm setting), the transfer cracked badly in the dryer. Very disappointing."
5,Astute corporate advice from a world class poet.,"David ""Whyte is a superb speaker, I know from having attended his presentations. By melding poetic and marketing sensibilities, he scores a memorable read."
2,I won't be recommending this book to anyone.,"Generally, I find that I have to suspend disbelief in business and management-related books. In the case of this book, mere suspension didn't help. As a poet, the author places importance and meaning on poetry. He attempts to drag you into the pond with him, but offers little in the way of HOW you might do this or WHAT you might receive from it. As for Beowulf, it's a great story, but it is basically a fairy tale and not something on which to base my life - or my career."
3,Mixed feelings about this one,"I have some real mixed feelings about this book. On the one hands I really like how Mr. Whyte used such unconventional ways to get his point across (he uses poetry to point out the flaws in the corporate world), but on the other hand, a lot of the points in the book made me scratch my head and go 'huh?!'.The material is very deep and even where there is supposed to be just a small, simple message, Whyte seems to make it complicated so that the meaning looks to be more profound."
4,Worthwhile reading,"I found the storytelling to be the most powerful part of the text as the images invoked are stong enough to carry though my day like a dream, yet I can go back and revisit this dream and build stronger meaning. There does appear to be agap between the spiritual and the practical here, but as a source of inspiration to continue to infuse one's heart into one's work, it does the job better than any other."
2,what is talked about please,could someone state is this the same as the philadelphia bono interview or the chrome dreams repackage please and some of what is talked about so we can know if this is worth buying and if theres anything new from saint bono
2,Not impressed,"I was not at all impressed with these toothpicks! I feel they have very little flavor. I was looking for a replacement for JuJu Stix, which recently went out of business. These do not even come close to being as good!"
1,A huge let-down!,"I am a huge fan of New Orleans, Louisiana, and voodoo in all its glory and gore; and I was anxious to view this film. Eventually, after I finally got through the film, I was terribly disappointed.Madsen is not his usual intense self; and what happened to Rosanna Arquette? This was certainly not a quality film - quite the opposite, a true low-budget flick."
1,Oh my god,"This film took the name of an earlier film starring Tony Todd. This one is just silly. Theres hardly anything even about voodoo in the film, its a boring car chase kinda thing which has about 5 minutes of ""voodoo"" performance total,. I highly reccomend you avoid this one"
2,...unexpected...,"it was a charger for the psp. however, it was not what was advertised. it was just a normal charger, not the ""rapid charge"" like advertised. still has wall and car charger for it, though."
5,Awesome,"These guns are amazing and definetely worth it for the price. I switched them to the outside mode and put a mini-spotting scope on my gun and I could snipe someone easily from over 200 hundred feet away! The only thing that I don't like is that if you don't use a scope, the aiming is a little bizarre. Without a scope you have to aim from the plastic rail to the right side of the gun, it takes little getting used to but it's pretty accurate without a scope."
2,WAY TOO COMPLICATED!,"I recently purchased this Laser Tag set for my nephews: 6 years old and 8 years old. I couldn't believe how complicated they made this classic game! There's at least 10 buttons on the gun: trigger, shields, ammo reload, ""option"", sound on/off, indoor/outdoor, ""2nd F""?, and like 5 others underneath an LCD screen. All I wanted was to put batteries in this thing and watch my cousins shoot each other. Instead I had to spend 15 minutes reading the instruction manual. And there was no off switch either for me to reset the game and start over (to follow the instructions). The youngest was getting frustrated because he was holding down the the reload button which wouldn't let him fire. He was actually crying saying, ""This doesn't work!"".All I wanted was the simple classic Laser Tag from my childhood: turn on and shoot. Not to say that this game isn't fun for older kids. In my opinion, though, Hasbro has gone way overboard and ruined a perfectly good game."
5,Ben Raines goes to Ireland!!,"Ben Raines(along with his army) has hit the shores of Ireland and procedes to do what he always does... In ireland he faces the ever present battles with the scum of the earth and the canbalistic night people.Overall-I know this is only Plup Fiction, but it is very good Pup Fiction. Before you start with this book however you should start at the begining of the serise, with Out of the Ashes"
3,Terror In The Ashes,I ran across this series quit by accident and have been getting the books for a few years.This book followed the story line of the others in the series and it was another good one.Thanks.
5,Works great,"Not much to say, it was super easy to install and works like a charm. Holds our broom, mop, and spider web duster. I wish it wasnt so bulky but oh well. The price was great and shipping fast!"
4,works better than expected,"there's nothing not to like - it's simple to install and comes with everything you need to do so. the only issue that would give it a 5 star rating would be if the pivot balls were spring loaded rather than relying on gravity, but it's still worth the money!"
1,great idea...but breaks in weeks,"We bought this to replace the clamp type that we had previously. It is a good thing that we only put them in the shed because we needed to put it back in within two weeks. The idea is great, but the mechanism is plastic and does not take much to break it."
3,Great Javelin Holder,"I cannot attest to this product's ability to hold mops and brooms, but as a way to store javelins, it's great. They are light-weight, and difficult to keep organized. Perhaps the manufacturer just needs to re-label it and market it at track meets."
2,Careful on tightening the screws,The first time I tightened the screws they broke through Had to use longer ones and a washer. Other wise it holds my tools' handles very well.
2,Whitney's latest single is hopefully the worst on her CD,"I don't know but when I think of Whitney I think of the lovely ""Bodyguard Soundtrack"", the nice 80's and first half of the 90's songs. But this song is (in my opinion) so unimaginative. Always the same and so boring. And the video is ridiulous, too. She's certainly done much better songs, this one is very modest."
5,Whitney's done it again.,"Following up a single like ""Heartbreak Hotel"" has got be tough, but when it comes to ""It's Not Right But It's Okay,"" Whitney scores another hit songfrom her successful CD, ""My Love Is Your Love."" The Thunderpuss mixes areso in right now. It could pass for a techno-euro NRG song from Europe. I also like the Club 69 mixes. They soundlike you could do a cat walk on somefashion shows on the run way. The Smooth Mix by Rodney Jerkins is so smooth that R&B radio stations are playing that version. Maybe it should have been on the album. Great versionof the ""Bodyguard"" movie hit ""I WillAlways Love You"" by Hex Hector. He reinvented a whole new mix without hurting the original too much. Even ballads make great dance remixes.(Michael Jackson's ""You Are Not Alone,""or Toni Braxton's ""Unbreak My Heart""are good examples.) Let's see if anyone, even Whitney, could top that."
3,"Remixed Fair, But Not OK","Sometimes, when I constantly hear remixes, they aren't really as good as the original. For Whitney Houston, she has definitely proved the point. Her song, It's Not Right But It's OK, the third single from her 1998 album, My Love Is Your Love, is a very edgey and strong song from a diva that has defined the music industry. The remixed version Rodney Jerkins whipped from Whitney is fair, but it really isn't as invigorating as the original one found on My Love Is Your Love. I like the song, but it was just not Whitney's best dance song, as much as her earlier songs were like I'm Your Baby Tonight, and I Wanna Dance With Somebody."
5,MUCH SOLE!,This sound track is the BOME!It expreses its self to women of are time and it gives us sole.This sound track also gives us the feeling that we can be on are own.WE DON'T NEED NO MAN! MICAELA M. SMITH
4,Great Mixes!!!!!,"The dance mixes, particularily the Thunderpuss Mix of ""It's Not Right"" are awesome!!!!!! They are some of the best dance mixes I have heard in a while! The Rodney Jerkins mix is cool and mellow. The mix of ""I Will Always Love You"" is very unique and is really cool! Whitney's vocals are the same speed as the original and with the dance beat it sounds really good! You should buy this because it is very rare in stores."
5,melon baller,great tool. I bought to go with my order of cookie order so I can attempt the fruit edible arrangement for a friends baby shower. It was perfect for this task.
2,Looks great but hard to put together,I had one problem with this enclosure. The screws that hold the hard drive in are hard to drive in all the way because the holes are not tapped. I managed to get one in and I just left the other screw out. It holds together fine with one screw.
5,Another great Peanuts holiday outing,"""Be My Valentine, Charlie Brown"" is a worthy addition to the Peanuts pantheon of prime-time holiday specials. Guess how many valentines Charlie Brown Receives? (The painful in-class distribution of cards rings true to my own childhood experience. In my kids' classes, they now require them to bring valentines cards for everyone, probably to avoid the tragi-comic scene that Charles endures so charmingly.) Even funnier is Linus's pining for his teacher, and Sally's mis-reading of the gift-buying by her ""sweet babboo."" As with all of the best Peanuts videos, this one works on (at least) two levels: Plenty of kid-friendly humor and hijinx, as well as wry dialogue for the more sophisticated viewers. Buy it with confidence."
4,The dark side of Valentine's Day,"Charles M. Schulz shows us the dark side of the holiday with Charlie Brown's trauma & Linus's crush. However, it's this harsh look at reality that has made the Peanuts specials so endearing because CB never gives up, and humor can be found in almost any situation."
5,magical peanuts,"it was like watching this classic for the first time,and seeing it in a remaster edition even better, never get tired of it- the Peanuts gang is always great to see over and over again"
3,"It's no Christmas or Halloween special, but it's a good time.","While this special doesn't really compare to the Christmas or Halloween specials, it is still a fun time if you enjoy the Peanuts characters."
5,Stunning!,"I already have this title in several editions (UK, US & German, how sad am I?!!!) however this edition stands out in both visual clarity & sound quality. I had to look at the release dates just to check they were really as old as they were. The remastering quality is stunning (why couldnt this have been done before?????????????). I have already ordered the 'Easter Beagle' in this set, and am looking forward to this in new & stunning clarity. I may now already have every Charlie Brown available on DVD, but i will certainly continue to buy these re-releases as the quality more than justifies the cost, and the little extras are a real bonus too!"
4,A Pure Classic,"This one's a no-brainer: it's a Peanuts holiday special so of course it's good. This one even has some good dramatic tension near the end between Schroeder and the girls who always pick on Charlie Brown that brings out all the pathos of Peanuts, and the way Charlie Brown cuts through the conflict you can't help but feel sorry for him. I'm docking this DVD release one star because it probably should've included the more recent Peanuts Valentine special that I believe originally aired in 2002, but now it may never be seen on any official release.UPDATE: The second Valentine special does have it's own DVD now: ""A Charlie Brown Valentine."""
3,Not for my 4 year old,"I grew up watching Charlie Brown. The videos are great. However, my 4 year old now copies the language that Lucy and others use. He is constantly say the words ""stupid"" and ""hate"". Things could be worse, but it just doesn't sound nice when your kid is saying that all the time in front of others. It is embarrassing. I never realized how negative these shows were. I am not a helicopter mom, but even I am taken back by the good old days being so rough around the edges. I don't recommend this for kids under 5."
3,...,"This dvd is okay. I dont know, maybe Im just pickie, but the reason I say this dvd is okay is because the original voices arent used. Atleast the voices I remember growing up listening to. I dont know maybe its just me, but if the original voices I've grown up knowing were used, I'd given it 5 stars."
1,Disappointed,"I expected to have the cartoon, but it was interviews and talk about how the show was made. NOT WHAT I EXPECTED."
1,Deceiving. NOT the movie. It's a documentary,Expected movie. Not Peanuts documentary. Deceiving. I think there are supposed to be additional episodes but everything but documentary is showing up unavailable.
3,ok,Its ok...wasnt what i thought it would be..its mostly about how the cartoons are created and put together by the animators.
4,Good value,"Bought the video for a school Valentine party. With the $2.50 donated by each child, we more than covered the cost of the video and then after viewing it, donated it to the teacher for future classes."
1,Not what I expected,"This is NOT an animated Charlie Brown show. It's a documentary about the comic strip. Since it was free, oh well. But I had the kids all ready to watch Charlie Brown and it was BORING!"
2,Really Really Bad,"Barely listenable, the interviewer was dry and lifeless. The facts and stories were old and nothing new, and there wasn't a lick of a guitar throughout. A utter waste of my time and money."
2,Heavy Christian overtones make it wrong for a secular classroom,"This is a warning for some potential buyers, and perhaps a selling point for others. The DVD has heavy Christian overtones. The first words of the first segment, which is supposed to be about the civilization of Mesopotamia, are: ""The Garden of Eden..."" It goes on to indicate it is inspired by an investigation into proving the stories of the Bible are true. I watched further and discovered the theme to be sustained enough to make it not useful for my purposes. The narrator, for instance, refers to time periods according to their proximity to, ""...the time of Jesus...""In a Christian school, or for Christians home-schooling, this would probably be good material for a social studies class, but it doesn't work in a secular school with students representing the full array of the world's faiths and cultures."
2,Teachers beware,"I purchased these as instructional DVDs for my World History Class. So far, I have not been able to use them. In my opinion, although the information is interesting and I enjoyed them, the information is not presented in a format designed for the modern classroom. In fairness to the videos, they were produced before the National Standards were implemented, and as such don't really follow the curriculum. I've watched Mesopotamia and Egypt since receiving the videos. Mesopotamia dealt primarily with the concept of Eden and relied heavily on the Bible, and Egypt focused almost exclusively on archaeology in the 1800s, mummies, and had a 20 second scene with a topless woman, whose purpose I still haven't deduced. I'm disappointed because I had hoped these would be great visual aids for the classroom, but I won't be able to use them. Teachers beware."
3,pretty much a surface guide to ancient cultures,"Someone watching these may think that they have an idea of the history involved, but this script line is the approved version in most cases.The Archeology isn't covered as well as it probably should be.I liked the style in any case with expert cameos."
2,Losing interest and patience in the Series,"The characters have become annoying. The plotlines are silly and ridiculous. Should the series continue on this path, I'll regretably have to chose not to follow Remo and Chiun into the creative and entertinment VOID in which they seem to be headed.I find myself skipping and skimming to avoid the pain of another pooly wriiten paragraph or chracter klunk. And are the ever more frequent F word and other obscenities really necessary?After having read ( and still posessing ) every book from volume one, it pains me to realize that I may have to give up the DESTROYER series rather than watch it deteriorate into just another low-brow fiction series."
2,It's not like the old days.,"I'm sure that many other reviewers have given a plot synopsis, so I'll make this short and sweet.I'm not sure who is writing the series now, but it sure isn't our late (and dearly-missed) friends Murphy and Sapir. It's as though someone asked Quentin Tarentino to guest-pen a book or two. The relationship between Remo and Chiun isn't right; the treatment of the blossoming relationship between Sarah Slate and Mark Howard is trivialized; the plot just plods along in predictable fashion; and the past is glossed over.If you're a die-hard Destroyer fan, you'll want to read it, but if not, buy some of the books pre-110 or so from Amazon's used section."
2,"Not Tim's best, by far!","Okay, I realize I'm in the vast minority here, but I'm a fan of the Destroyer series since 1985, and I'm not nearly as annoyed by Mr. Somheil's efforts as most. Having said that, this book was not his best work at all.I think if this book had been written as a 180-page Destroyer novel, it might've worked, but there's so much padding and unnecessary side-trips that this reader nearly lost interest. A shame too, as this is a rather pivotal book in the series, with lots of threads getting addressed in this story. I loved Remo and Chiun in this book. I don't even mind the new member of CURE--hell, eventually someone is going to have to show up for Remo to train in Sinanju. Not saying that would be Sarah Slade ... but you never know. ..."
5,These are great,These are great at keeping my dog busy for awhile. I am happy that he can chew on them and also be safe to eat.
4,"Great product,","Great product and good size for a lab, but my dog thought it was to chomp and eat, not chew on..."
2,17 minutes worth of fun,"That's how long it took my 1.5yr old 65lb Lab/Husky to polish this off. Glad he enjoyed it, but really disappointed in how fast it disappeared. I bought three flavors in the ""souper"" size but no longer have great expectations."
3,Standard Poodle has a 20 minute snack,"I like that this was Gluten-Free, Huge ( well, ""souper size"")and was a Nylabone product. We had some sucess with their product line for our 18 month Standard Poodle. Her drive to annihilate most anything that you put in front of her, we are constantly on the lookout for something costing $5.00- 12.00 and that will last at least a week. I would have been happy if it would have lasted her a day or more. I discovered this Healthy Edibles Roast Chicken Bones Giant at Petsmart. Bought it for $7.99 thinking it was what we needed for our weekend together. It is cheaper here at AMAZON right now,$5.74. I will think twice about that 20 minute snack, even at that price. THIS is been useful thoughNylabone Big Chews for Big Dogs, Knot"
4,WARP does it again,"Warp Records has again signed another great musical act in VLAD. Like a mix between Plaid and Autechre, Vlad has it's own unique sound like most all the other artists on the Warp label. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that this cd is only composed of four short tracks. Hopefully we will see a full length in the future."
2,Dissapointed,"I am very dissapointed with the Yoda costume. It is somewhat like the photo that is advertised, but it has no finished edges or seams. The photo looks much nicer and of better quality. The mask that came with the costume is not the same as pictured either. The mask also came so mashed that it did not even look like yoda. There are creases in the mask that I don't think will ever come out. I feel this costume is false advertising as the picture advertised and on the package does not match what is inside the package. Another frustration is that the tag on the cloak is on the side of the seam, so it is hard to hide it when the costume is being worn. The tag would have been much better on the back or the side seam. I ordered the small for my very tall 5 year old and it is still a bit long."
3,Cheap mask,Mask is poor quality. Its very cheap made and the picture isn't accurate. The clothing portion seems to be fine. I just was not impressed with the cheap quality of the mask. I expected more for the price of the costume. I am considering buying a separate mask that is better quality.
4,Yoda made a hit.,"I got this for my 6 year old grandson who was having a Star Wars birthday party. He loved it! The quality of the material was not that great. We were afraid the small might not be large enough so we got the medium (which was too big, but I was able to take it up.) It was very cheaply made, but he was thrilled with it. The eye holes on the mask were too small, but I was able to make them a little larger using a scissor."
3,"good the costume was, yes. yes.",It was a little long for my son but a quick and basic hem fixed that. the velcro on the mask wasn't very strong.
4,My Mommy Comes Back,"It arrived in good condition within a reasonable time. Since it was a gift I haven't heard back from the recipient yet, but I'm sure she'll like it."
5,What's Under There?,"They took away my heater--my dignity too!My face turned red, but my fingers turned blue.So I put on these long johns, hidden from view.And now I'm quite toasty--and you can be too!"
2,"Thin, ""breathable""",They call them breathable. I call them just too thin & cheap. You can see through them clear enough to see what's on the other side of them when holding them up (through 2 sides)... almost like looking through thin tights. It's as cold as not wearing them at all. They make my legs itch too... especially near the ankles.
5,Stable and fast,"I've just ordered this a second time, It's a great product, though you should know your way around a BIOS before getting this, as it requires 1.95 volts at minimum compared to the average 1.85 volts. Very stable ram, highly recommended."
4,"Good product, low price","Bought these for my brother's computer for Xmas then realized they wouldn't fit his system - so I ordered him more specific RAM and added these to mine instead. No problems with them specifically - though my unit did end up with a trojan in April and one of the RAM got infected (as well as the hard drive), so I didn't get a chance to use them for long."
2,Disappointed!,"I'm writing a book review for the first time, because I was quite disappointed with this book even though I had read all of the several reviews posted here before hand. I think the reviews here don't represent the true value of this book.In short, this book is a lot of bits and pieces of episodes that do not really lead to any theory or takeaway. I kept hoping til the end that something worth remembering would come up.I would recommend this book to someone fresh out of college who needs basic understanding of corporate politics, but definitely not to any of my friends with work experience (5+ years?).I decided to buy this book because I had not taken any power and influence related courses during my MBA studies in the US. I had kept all the syllabi of all courses offered at my school and I was catching up on some textbook readings for the courses I hadn't taken. This is another reason why I didn't think twice about buying it without reading it.I hope this helps!"
3,Very Technical...,An easy read. The style of writing is helpful. While the focus is clearly corporate some of the concepts can be applied in other environments.
4,Eye opener,Good book that provides insight into how to diagnose and use power in an organization. Good for politics and business.
4,Powerful or Powerless,"You can only gain from reading Managing With Power. Pfeffer provides many examples to illuminate to the reader what power is, why it is important, how to use it, and how to lose it. Whether or not you decide to apply the fundamentals of this book, you will at least be more aware of how others use power around and against you. There is nothing to lose from reading Managing With Power."
5,"Art Bell Show Coast To Coast AM Feb. 24, 1997","D. Fairechild did a great, very long interview on the Art Bell Show Coast To Coast AM Feb. 24, 1997...highly recommend everyone listen to it, she covered everything and it's all in this book."
5,Headset for work,I needed a replacement headset for my work phone. After looking at the different options I choose this and its what was needed and wanted.
3,Half n' half,"There were parts of this book that really annoyed me like Colin's constant whining about Langston Campbell, having the next bestseller, the advice about marketing and the ""author plugs"". Have you ever heard that one person who gives a shout-out to 50,000 people instead of 5? Yep, that was this book, but Duck kept repeating the same authors. I got it the first time! I was disconnected to him & his wife's relationship. On the other hand, I loved Courtney's character because he rarely pointed out other athletes, didn't whine, showed strength when weakness was guessed, and had a strong, mysterious past. Half the book was good. The other half was a yawn."
3,An Oldie but a Goodie.,"Well worth the trip back to nostalga, but does show signs of superceded technology. I still like it though. It's a must have for any collector of this genre along with Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Blue Velvet."
5,"Cheap, Gory Funfest","I have an old DVD copy of this slasher movie. It is watchable. Not sure a $22.00 upgrade is worth it. This movie actually delivers gore, nudity and violence in abundance unlike most others of its genre which are disappointing. I recommend it but wait for the price to come down."
3,Not for the faint of heart,"""Pieces"" starts off with a young Boston lad who is reprimanded by his mother for assembling a nudie puzzle. Pretty risque' for a kid in 1942, I guess. But then adolescent rebellion rears it's ugly head and the young man attacks his mother with an axe. The police think someone else did it, however, and the story moves to present day at a college campus. A mystery assailant starts dismembering coeds with a chainsaw, and a detective (Christopher George) is on the case. Low budget gorefest should deliver the goods for horror fans, but don't say I didn't warn you. Have fun!"
2,Disappointingly routine slasher,"This film starts off brilliantly with a flashback showing a young lad dispatching his mother with a hatchet when she discovers him assembling a jigsaw of a naked woman. However, it rapidly degenerates into a boring, by the numbers maniac on the loose movie, which, despite being a Spanish production, is indistinguishable from scores of American films. Star Christopher George is given very little to do, and the rest of the cast are pretty dire, even by slasher standards. The special effects are certainly bloody, but they're not very convincing and won't shock anyone who's into modern horror. George fans should give this one a miss and check out Lucio Fulci's City of the Living Dead instead."
2,Gloriously gory but incurably dumb,"Let's face it: If you intend to buy or rent ""Pieces,"" you're not looking for the cinematic version of a Dostoevsky novel. However, you might be looking for something that contains just the tiniest bit of gray matter. Lotsa luck. ""Pieces"" is a spectacular piece of gross-out cinema (sensitive viewers should keep barf bags handy), but it is also dumber than one might consider to be humanly possible: clumsy plotting, terrible dialogue, universally bad acting. Ed Wood was equivalent to Akira Kurosawa compared to the geniuses who made this masterpiece. You can feel your IQ sinking as you watch. By the second hour, you'll be lucky if you can still pass a first-grade equivalency exam."
2,Great release for a very gory plotless movie,"Disgustingly gory horror movie that has no real story/plot or it is just unclear. It is about a kid who killed in the past that grows up to be a person who likes to chop up bodies and make human jigsaw puzzles - at least I think that was the implication. It is not really clear what is going on with the killer and his hacking up bodies. Nothing is really explained clearly why he is a warped killer and enjoys hacking up bodies.There is no body to this story other than our killer chopping up bodies on a college campus with looks of horror as people see the cut of body pieces. Some graphically gory films are done in taste, while stuff like this is really just brutally bad & sickening. Gore lovers will enjoy this, even if the plot is thin & the acting is just 'whatever'. This DVD transfer from Grindhouse as as clean as it gets in the USA. Substandard acting & story, but really just a gross out slasher movie. Not for everyone. Very gory, but also very weak."
3,Slightly Overrated,It's not one of the top ten horror films ever. It's not even one of the top ten horror films of the nineteen eighties. It's amusing enough in its own deranged axe chopping way. Better than watching (say) Halloween Part 4. (Or is that damning with faint praise?)
4,Decent 80's budget film,"I own this movie in a cult horror box set and I have to admit that it is indeed a decent very low budget 80's slasher. There are intense amounts of gore and nudity as well as an interesting story line with the killer and an ending you won't soon forget. Overall, I'd give it a pretty good rating."
3,Pieces,"If you like unknown actors, cheap special gore effects..then you will like this movie. Not too bad a movie. The best part is the last scene of the movie. At a cheap price. Buy it! Add it to your cheesy slasher collection."
1,i'd rather pick my nose for an hour and a half,"This movie is dumb as hell. It's about a little boy working on a puzzle of a naked woman when his mother catches him. He kills her with an axe, and then makes a human puzzle using body parts. The highlight of this mess was the ending."
2,I'm ashamed to say this but...it's a guilty pleasure,"This film is like a grisly accident...it's terrible to watch yet I feel compelled to stare!This movie is so exploitive, misogystic, the script appears impromptu, there is no suspense and the plot is as conveluted as can be.There is no artistic creativity employed to produce this film...yet.... I can't take my eyes off of it!"
2,Cheesy,"I bought this movie and the Prowler. I thought both were cheap and cheesy. I like a good scarey movie combined with the slasher factor and neither of these fit the bill (to me anyway.) Maybe if I were watching these-in the 80's- I would feel differently, but they did nothing for me."
5,?,"I've never actually seen this movie, but judging from the title it must of won an academy award!! If anyone has actually seen this movie, please write to me and tell me your thoughts on it."
5,Great slasher film.,"I really like this movie, it's violent very silent and it's plot and story are quite good for a horror movie. Not many movies about serial killers are this intense. If you are into violent deaths, interesting plot twists, naked women and a ""What the F---"" ending. I recommend you purchase this film"
2,not worth it,"My 5 year old daughter loves praise music and any DVD that shows kids singing and dancing. This DVD is great praise music but the images are landscape, cityscape and nature with occational words on the screen. Not appealling to children at all."
1,Still did not receive it,"I never receive the DVD I did order but instead I got a movie call ROMERO. iT WAS THE SAME dvd I did get unstead of my DVD. I did send you back the first one, but I did not bother this one. It was not a good experience.Maxime Kra"
2,"Not for beginners (perhaps not intermdediates, either)","I enjoy reading about chess at least as much as I enjoy playing it, and I look for books that will improve my play by (1) giving me something to practice (i.e. workbooks) or (2) correcting my thinking. This book purports to be in the second category, but I can tell you, as a beginner, I got nothing out of it.There is very little English describing how to excel; rather the author gives you games to look at as examples and you, the reader, are supposed understand the brilliance behind the moves. For me, this is not enough: I need a tour guide to show me the sights, not just a taxi driver to take me to them. I'm guessing that very good players don't need such hand-holding, hence my title for this review.One reviewer suggested that you will like this book if you like Rowson's ""The Seven Deadly Chess Sins"". Well, I'm only partway through TSDCS but I can tell you that I'm really enjoying it, but did not enjoy (or learn from) Excelling at Chess."
2,"Nothing helpful, Blah Blah Blah","The author must have written this from another planet or from another century. She never mentions, alcoholism or drugs or anything else out of the ordinary. It is absolutely not worth it."
1,"Don't waste your money; get the free guide, which will let you know what","places allow pets. All this book does is list all the places that allow pets in the whole country in one publication, with a few pages that explain what to look out for."
4,"Not bad, just not great either","This is a pretty good post apocalypse novel. There's plenty of action. There's death and fights. There is rebuilding of society. All in all, it is not bad.I like that one of the characters was a Wiccan, but there were annoying parts to this as well. At the beginning, it was difficult to follow her speech since there was a lot of Scottish Rite speak. I found myself skipping those lines and just reading the English translation.What I didn't like was that each of the main characters was just too lucky or perfect. They needed a bow maker, and just happened upon a bow maker. They arrive at one of their destinations only to find that the neighbor passed on but left a year's worth food for them to scavenge?I think it would have been more realistic if everything didn't go their way. At no time was there any doubt that they would get through it alive."
3,Not too shabby,"Overall, a really decent post-apocalyptic book. I love the concept behind the story and think it makes for a good premise. The whole story feels possible and really gets one to think about what he or she would do if every modern convenience were nothing more than a glorified paperweight. I have yet to read any of Stirling's other books but I probably will in the future. I only give this book a 3/5 because it felt a little predictable. I had a pretty good hunch about what would happen through most of the book and only part of this was due to foreshadowing. At other times it feels like I could have written something like this myself, which is a turn-off for me. Even with these flaws, I am still glad I read this book and will probably pick up the next in the series, but I am in no rush to do so."
4,"A few flaws, but overall a good read","Definitely an interesting spin on the post-apocalypse theme. A little disappointing in that the reason for ""The Change"" is never explained, only suggested or implied. Also found it a little far-fetched that the main characters resigned themselves to their fate so quickly. There was also a lot of redundancy with the characters reiterating the same conclusions about the state of the world. Oh, and it definitely made me ponder how truly useless I would be under the same circumstances :) Aside from that, I was fully engrossed and look forward to continuing the series."
2,Coulda Been Really Great,"Here's a book that has a great premise and interesting characters, but was poorly executed. The author jumps back and forth introducing multiple characters, and skips big chunks of critical action. I actually checked page numbers to see if I had a misprinted copy and missed something.There's also some incredible coincidences that stretch belief even within the realm of a fantasy/science fiction genre. The fact that several groups of random strangers who meet all possess rare and improbable skills such as blacksmithing, swordsmithing, archery, and bowmaking was just too much."
2,"I am in the ""liked half of this book"" camp.","The parts of the story that involved Havel were probably 250% better than the parts with Juniper.I tried desperately to like this book more; I simply couldn't stomach the wicca parts. I literally start skipping over the chapters that invovled Juniper and her people. It isn't that I have a problem with wicca (anymore than I have a problem with christianity or any other religion); I just didn't like how it was mentioned every other word. It was almost embarrassing reading all the ""thanks earth mother for the deer that we just shot with a bow"" stuff.All in all, I don't think I would suggest this book to any of my friends unless they were really desperate for something to read."
3,"Dies the fire--who have the strength, intelligence, experience points to surive?","The book starts out with a fantastic premise: how would we fare if we suddenly had that last 250 years of technological progress taken away? Who would have the will, the strength and intelligence to succeed in this new world? Put another way: who will inherit the earth? The answer, according to the author, is crystal clear and incontestable: Dungeons and Dragons dorks.Make it so!Seriously, aside from the shoe-horned Wiccan, LOTR, D&D; stuff, the novel is quite strong. Once technology fails--government falls apart, society breaks down, chaos ensues, demogogues take power and the world becomes brutal. Quickly, as in weeks. A bleak, but plausible speculation."
3,Cool story idea but needs editing,"This review is for the first four books in the series. The story idea is great and I'd say the first book is the best; the second is second best and so on. I really enjoyed the first book; but by the time I finished the fourth book I had had enough of the series. The books would be much improved if 25% of the content was removed by an editor. My biggest complaint is the massive emphasis on wiccans. Holy cow what a yawner that turns out to be. Pages and pages of wiccan stuff that contributes nothing to the story.Aside from that, the first three books especially are interesting post apocalyptic works that are worth reading, espcially if you just skip all the wiccan mumbo jumbo.I am also curious what the author thinks of the upcoming TV series called 'Revolution', which seems to have borrowed much from this series."
2,"Good book, but it could have been SO much better.","Don't get me wrong, I like Stirling, but this was not his best work. The central plot was great, but all too often I had to just ignore the glaring coincidences that happened to the characters (""Oh, look we just found an ex-SAS member who just happens to make long-bows in his spare time!"") I mean, come on! Within a couple chapters the main characters have surrounded themselves with the exact kind of people one would want in such a crisis. Way too convenient.... And don't get me started on that annoying character Juniper! All the wiccan stuff makes you want to laugh. If you want a great end-of-the-world story go read The Stand by King or Swan Song by McGammon. Those books won't disappoint you."
1,Huh?,I choose my books carefully because I have a bit of an obsession...I have to finish a book before I start another. The premise and the first 100 pages (or so) was interesting albeit well beyond belief. Things came to a screeching halt about 3/4 of the way through. I painfully pushed myself to read the last couple hundred pages. To whom is this book intended? Dungeons and Dragons fans? Renaissance Faire junkies? It was hard to finish.
3,A Fun Read,"The Positive: In the end it was a fun read. The characters are engaging on a surface level and, as a reader, I did want to know their fate. It ended up being a rip-roaring adventure tale with a little thinking and speculation required.The Negative: It is not The Stand. About 50 pages into the book, I contemplated abandoning it. The writing was a little tedious. The characters are one-dimensional and seem to drift without purpose or moral center other than defense. But it was worth continuing.I hope there is another book with a wider perspective. The characters (and the world) seem to need a bigger purpose."
3,"Good setting, poor execution","A book that tells the story of what happens to the world when all technology fails and people are forced to live a new and more primitive existence. As a fan of Robert Adam's Horseclans series and ""Ariel:A Book of the Change"" (treat yourself if you can find a copy) by Steven R. Boyett, when someone in my scifi reading group recommended this book to me (they didn't tell me it was part of a trilogy) I immediately picked it up off the shelf. There are some early problems with story in ""Dies the Fire"" that I had a difficult time getting past, and readers have to overlook some large plot holes. Despite this I found the characters and situations fascinating and even though the sequel didn't get great reviews I will probably pick it up (I am encouraged by a review that stated the one dimensional villain gets more depth in the sequel)."
4,Sci Fi Fun,"Stirling has created a fun read, and he hits it on the head when telling how quickly our thin veneer of civilization can crash. The flow of time in this novel is a bit hard to follow. The characters are one dimensional for the most part. Nevertheless, I was entertained enough to buy the sequel."
5,A gritty post apocalptic classic,I couldn't stop reading this book. I was engrossed with the characters and their fight to survive in a world that no longer had any of the modern conveniences all of us take for granted. Each of the characters were well developed. I only wish the author had spent a bit more time with the villain of the book. After I finished the book I couldn't wait to read the sequel to find out what happens next.
4,Great Read!,"I really don't get some of 1 or 2 star reviews for this book. People c'mon! We are not comparing this work of art to Dostoyevsky! Yes, it will not enter the pantheon of ""greatest ever ever"" but this is a very good novel for its genre. I would give it 4 1/2 stars, it is very well written, the plot is interesting, the characters are colorful and there is plenty of action going on. And yes, Stirling does sometimes lapses into rather tedious scenery and gastronomic descriptions but this is definitely survivable."
4,"At last, adventure","All this book needed to make it perfect was a werewolf or two. There's an art to telling a story, and this is a well-told tale, fast-moving and without any huge stumbling blocks. Granted, the characters were a bit too eager to figure out and accept what had happened would be permanent, and the unpleasant details of what actually happened were left out, but I'm willing to cut the story some slack.One of the characters is a modern-day witch, the other your basic man's man, thereby covering all the bases. You've got your female geeks covered, and your male geeks entertained as well. This isn't exactly social science: there's no real depth here, but who's looking for that in an adventure yarn? In time, I suspect this very lack will become a liability, but if you're in the mood for a good adventure tale, this is it. There's no shame in either liking good adventure or writing it. What a pity it's fallen out of favor."
2,Talk about biased.,"Now lets get something straight first: I am not a conservative person. I am quite liberal and I try to understand everyone's point of view. However, within the first few pages this author compared a cat to a Republican. I know that doesn't sound like much and I personally don't agree with Republicans but still...Do I have to be fed stupid biased comparisons when all I want to do is sit down and read a book for enjoyment? I don't need that even if I do agree with his side. Then you add all the Wiccan's being great and Christians evil and I got mad again. I dont even like Christians. Oh man, don't buy this book if your nit-pick things like I do. If you don't then you might like this book but I don't know because I threw it angrily after a few pages. Enjoy!"
2,Unbelievable... and not in a good way.,"I have enjoyed some other books by Stirling, but I couldn't finish this one. I was rolling my eyes so often I thought they'd fall out of my head.If you are a Wiccan member of the SCA, you'll probably love this book. If you hate interpersonal conflict, you'll also love this book. I have never read a book where all the main characters got along so well, all the time. They agree on who should lead them, they find each other amazingly interesting, and if there is a disagreement, logic quickly prevails. I'm not sure who these people are, but they're too perfect to be human.If you like post-apocalyptic fiction, I'd skip these and look for the books he wrote set in the universe of the Terminator movies. I enjoyed those."
4,"FAST Service, Decent Price, and as described","FAST Service, Decent Price, and as described . I'd use them again as I had a a very positive experience."
2,Library edition,"In case you are unaware, a Library Edition, such as this book, a paperback sized hardcover. The novel itself is excellent (as I already knew) but I was looking to complete my ""Dies The Fire"" hardcover collection. The book I recived was not as I expected, but as described."
5,"Dies the Fire Awesome book, awesome series","Dies the FireThe only thing better than this book, is this book on the Kindle ! I am not your typical ""alternative time"" or Sci-Fi"" reader, but this story has such an appeal, I couldn't put it down. S.M. Stirling must have known that it was too good to end, because he continues to let me enjoy these characters, their trials and tribulation, and their triumphs for many years in his ongoing saga. He doesn't sugar coat it, favorite characters fall, and the bad guys sometimes win, but you pull all the harder for victory ! I hope women as well as men, find this series and devour all of them. Keep writing them Mr. Stirling ! I am so not ready to let go !!!!Sharon Fortin"
4,Interesting. . .,"I enjoyed this book. While the whole chemical alteration (gunpowder, gas..) was a bit far fetched I still thoroughly enjoyed reading it. I only had one dislike, and that was I felt as though Stirling was pushing the Wiccan religion a bit too hard. I understand that in the situation presented in the book that most people would fall back on their religion, but still, Stirling pushes it over and over. If you can over look that, as I did, and are looking for an interesting story I recommend this book."
4,"The Remains of Island in Sea of Time, etc","As one of, I expect was many, whom recommended that he write a novel or series of the what remains when ""Nantucket took a trip"", I though it was well researched and written. He could have made the ""bad guys"" a bit more dimensionable since he did make the ""good guys & gals"" somewhat human. It is a good novel of the collapse of the venier of civilization and the rise of new communities. The battle scenes are well thought out as well as the forward march of the intertwined stories. Looks as if it is a start of a series, which we will all look forward to.Gerr"
1,Dies the Fire,"I had just finished reading ""The Road"" and wanted to read more books in the genre so I picked up Dies the Fire. I don't think this was the best choice. I could only get through about 120 pages before I realized that this was a waste of my time.It started out with promise, but then quickly went downhill. The character Juniper was just painful!. The whole Wicca aspect got real old real fast. The book could have been shortened by 50 pages if they got rid of half of the Blessed Be aspects.I also found it unbelievable how everyone just happened to accept their fate and jumped back into a medieval state so quickly. I was in NYC for the Blackout of 2003, the way this book made it out I guess we should have been panicking and killing each other with broad swords in the streets. Instead we hung out on the porches and sidewalks and had a beer."
1,"Should have been called ""Dies the Story""","In all my years of reading there have been very few books I've left unfinished, even if they were bad. This one came very close. A mysterious ""something"" causes a blinding flash that not only ruins all electronics and electrical items but changes the chemical nature of gunpowder and steam compression. Which means that those who've spent their time at SCA meetings finally have an edge on the rest of society. Lots of hacking and maiming with swords and BS about Wicca. Yay. Dies the Interest is another title I'd have given this novel."
3,Makes me hate Wiccans,"This book is a very interesting examination of how the world would fall apart without power and guns. I liked the premise a lot, but just couldn't get behind the Juniper character at all. The unrealistic skill set that the folk singer/songwriter possesses is just too fanciful. The Mike Havel bits are much more interesting overall. I felt the Juniper/Clan Mackenzie section would have been much better if it left out the mysticism and used the other clansmen more. It is an okay read, but I won't be continuing the series as it seems to be going in a more fantastical direction."
2,Great concept but poorly executed,This book like all of stirlings books sound like a great read.They would be to if you could cut out all the excess descriptive parts.You need some description but he goes way overboard with it to the point that it detracts from the story.That coupled with the extra small print on the page is intimidating.I started reading this book and after 35 pages was getting eye strain.The book has 483 pages filled with very small print and my eyes were hurting after only 35 pages so I gave it up.I could have understood the 483 pages if the print was larger but with all the excess discription and normal size print this book would have been around 600 to 700 pages.Jose Farmer and several other scifi authors could have written this same story in 350 pages of readable size print and the over all story would have been better for it.I was looking forward to reading all stirlings work but now I think I will let them pass.MY LOSS!!!!
1,One of the worst sci-fi books I ever read,"This book starts with an intrigue concept but the actual execution is a totally different matter.The author's writing style is sloppy and dry. Characters are at best two dimentional and you don't really care much whether they live or die. The technical aspects of the book is borderline hilarious. So You need some technical minded experts in a particular situation? boom, they poped out from middle of nowhere and get it done.After 100 pages or so, I threw it away."
1,"Left ""Science"" Out Of The Science Fiction","I just read this, having purchased it off a remnants table at a local bookstore. I was intrigued with the premise as I, too, enjoy apocalyptic fiction. Of course, the first thing one needs in apocalyptic fiction is an apocalypse. Sadly, the one here is not believable in the slightest: A storm of some sort wipes out the functioning capacity of all things electric AND changes the chemical composition of explosives so that firearms don't work. Thus does everyone in the novel proceed to dress up as Lancelot or in one case William Wallace and do battle.Simply put, the author asks us to believe that the laws of physics have only been partially altered in ways wholly implausible. Further, the characters jump to quickly into playing knights of the round table without any questioning whatsoever or investigation into alternatives.If you like science in your science fiction, stay away from this."
2,"Great potential, sabotaged","I'm a huge fan of this genre but unfortunately, this one gets bogged down by the overabundance of wiccan references and language, which are really distracting and over the top. Hookups happen all too improbably and as other reviewers have pointed out, characters with great promise never get developed and are left as literary stereotypes (the blonde aloof girl turns out to be a fighter! The Tolkein-obsessed misfit turns out to be a heroine!) It's an interesting story but I kept getting pulled out of it by these missteps."
1,Don't Buy Books By Crooks!,"This book is a complete ripoff of Steven R. Boyett's 1984 fantasy novel ARIEL, down to the SCA and hang-gliding attacks. Stirling even calls the event that destroys modern technology ""the Change."" Save your money and read the better, *original* version."
2,Interesting,An interesting and unique post-apocalyptic genre book. The writing left something to be desired and it seemed like a teen novel. I would recommend it to anyone interested in the genre though because again - it is unique. I am also very familiar with the area the book takes place which held my interest in the book.
4,Good and satisfying read.,"One of those books you look forward to reading. Wanted to give it 4.5 stars. It rates 950 pages on my and my son's personal book reading system.0 pages - Read the cover and know for sure you've just read the best part of the book.50 pages - Give it 50 pages but don't get stuck on a trans-continental flight with nothing else to read.100 pages - Interesting and can hold you through most chapters, but either predictable or you find yourself thinking good ending but not all questions answered500 pages - Look forward to reading it and a good and satisfying ending.1000 pages - Stay up all night, can't put it down, find another one by this author fast!Ending is great and leaves you ready for the next in the series. Hope he stops at three like the other great east coast trilogy. Three's enough, so I'm saving the 1000 page fifth star for the final book."
3,"Great story telling, but...","I have to say I love the concept of the book, but was startled at the stark lack of familiarity with the subjects being written about. The author seems very familiar with all the right words, but seems to understand very little of how many of the things he writes about actually work. I don't refer to the scientific aspects either even though these are the most far fetched.Having lived directly within the area written about, being a lifelong archer and outdoorsman myself it was more than a bit of a leap to get past so many errors. I'm a great fan of sci-fi/fantasy writing, but it's just such a stretch to keep seeing the same kinds of misunderstandings show up again and again. I had the impression that the author had read a LOT about the things he was writing, but had very little actual life experience with most of them. Still, the story telling is just enough to keep you engaged despite the detachment from reality."
3,"Just ""OK""","A good idea that just didn't do it for me. The idea that gunpowder no longer works was just too over the top. EMP can only do so much. I was also put off by how only the nerds-wiccans-tree hugging history professors or highly trained military are the only ones ""smart"" enough to survive. Like I said it was a good idea but just a bit too much for me to find believable."
1,Thank god I paid used mass market paperbook price,Would have been OK if every character wasn't an attendee of your local Sci Fi Convention. The prose was a 500+ advertisement for the Society for Creative Anachronisms and Wiccans - all whom apparently have a monopoly on the skills needed to survive in a societal breakdown. This sort of naivety comes from someone who's spent too much time at the library and playing D&D and isn't very entertaining after the 50 page rule.
3,"Great idea, poor realization","This is more a review of the whole ""Change"" series. I'm always up for a good postapocalyptic yarn and the idea that the SCA and other 'retro' skills types are the inheritors of the earth is a very intriguing one. Unfortunately, the most interesting aspects aren't capitalized on. The best stuff happens within the first volumn of the saga - Dies the Fire - but even there culture and society evolve unrealistically fast and easily and the story devolves into a generic sword and sorcery/celtic(for the most part)spirituality/""chosen one"" tale. I think that it could have been placed into any background instead of flowing from such a great premise. The author is talented but it just feels like he (and the reader) missed out on what could have been a really unique series. So I can only give it 3 stars overall - Dies the Fire gets 5 for the initial idea but I'm averaging out because I enjoyed each book less and less."
3,"Pretty good part 1 of trilogy, later expanded to larger series","The book is fairly well written but suffers from poor editing from two perspectives.1) There are many abrupt scene changes where you are reading one paragraph (characters in one place), then without any transition the next paragraph starts a new scene/plot flow. Very disconcerting, and done quite a bit.2) The book is long and there are lots of lull-spots where not much happens.Both these characteristics are in Dies the Fire and The Protector's War. I didn't read the third yet, but I expect to continue with a lot of scanning over laborious or slow sections."
4,Impressed...,"I first became interested in this book because part of it takes place in towns and regions that I grew up in. Second to that, I'm always game for a good post-apocalypse type book. After seeing an interview with the author, I put Dies the Fire on my wishlist and received it for Christmas. I'm 95% of the way through the book and am quite impressed with it. I'll be continuing onto the next books in the series. As an aside, I did notice a few, shall we say, differences in opinion about some terminology and survival issues (from a background in Search and Rescue), but overall I think it's a fine fictional look at survival under such conditions."
1,Someone should apologize to the trees this was printed on.,"I'm a fan of the End Of The World genre, but my copy of this is now in the trash after little more than 200 pages. The absolutely endless ""Blessed be's"", ""Oh Goddess!"", and description after description of rites and rituals, and then the obligatory beaten to death ex-Super Cliche Marine made this the most annoying, irritating 6 hours in memory. How anyone was capable of finishing, let alone enjoy this book is honestly disturbing to me."
2,Kinda Flaky,"I like these sorts of books. What I like about them is imagining how real people would react in a situation that is unimaginable. The problem is that the author uses flaky, unreal characters that are hard to relate to. I would not like a book that preached to me about christianity, and likewise I do not like this book when it so often seems to be preaching the Wiccan religion. I bumped it up from one to two stars only because there are some good action scenes, and the character Mike Havel seems to be somewhat believable, if a little to good at living in the brave new world Stirling creates. Read this if you are a die hard fan of similar books or in to pseudo fantasy novels, otherwise don't waste your money."
4,Excellent post-apocolyptic saga,"I really enjoyed reading this novel - and was surprised, because most recent fantasy/sci-fi has been pretty disappointing. I thought the portrayal of modern-day practitioners of witchcraft was excellent. There were many well-defined characters, though some of them - such as Astrid and Aylward - didn't get as big of a part as I had hoped. There was a little too much battle action for me, but overall, an entertaining and well written book. It made me realize just how dependent I am on modern technology."
3,"Works, but not really needed.","I bought this for our new Skybox thinking that it would help keep stuff organized inside. I suppose it would, if there was only a little in there. For better or worse we only use the Skybox when we need a lot more room, so since we purchased this 6 months ago we haven't had a need to use it once! We use the Skybox a time or two a month, but when we do we have it packed enough that stuff doesn't have room to slide around. So, if you plan to fill your Skybox only 1/4 of the way then it might be helpful, but if you plan to fill it more than that it isn't helpful and just gets in the way.So, reason for 3 stars: not all that helpful for our situation, plus it falls off the clips. I took it out and expect I'll never use it."
1,Not worth the money.,I have been developing in .NET for a long time and this book has nothing interesting. First it has a limited set of topics. Secondly the depth of the topics is shallow. I realized that if you dont have a good topic to write then write an eye catching title to sell the book.Some of the reviewers mentioning its good for junior developers. My advice to them would be is to get a good .NET book and not waste time on a book that could credit itself only for the eye catching title.I wish there was an option of not giving any stars.
3,Average Read for Beginers and Mid-level Dev,"Like other reviewers have pointed out, ""Best Kept Secrets in .NET"" is a bit misleading title. From a developer's jargon, it would mean internals of assembly binding redirection or uncharted waters of machine.config etc however, this book is more about shortcuts and development techniques from an IDE perspective. ""Literally"" speaking, its a cross between Visual Studio Hacks and Code to Developer.Apart from its name, it's generally a good book for beginers and average book for mid-level devs and skim through for seniors in case they won't know how to store code snippets in toolbox. I liked the improving unit testing and defensive development sections along with much ADO and hidden tricks in VS.NET. The Apress roadmap explains the intended audience and its a good match but generally, I'd recommend Coder to Developer for this particular genre of IDE/Process learning."
4,Helpful performance gems and good coding practices,"While this book does not go into great depth in any one area, it does a good job of recommending ways to increase the performance of code as well as make it more readable and extensible. Many of the tips apply across programming practice (i.e. short-circuiting and/or), but a few are related to just .NET. It is at least worth the $20 Amazon is selling it at (30 Nov 2004) for intermediate / beginning programmers. Advanced programmers may not find anything new however."

2,cheap,"This item is fairly thin and inexpensive looking. The color accents look salmon or apricot in the lit photo. Sadly in life, they are the color of bazooka bubble gum. It is not what I expected or wanted and I am returning it."

BREATHLESS is presented in full-screen, with Dolby Digital mono (English, French, Spanish). Some extras; see individual titles (ASIN 6304883773 and 0792844807, respectively)."

It is over an hour of just interviews But, if you are looking for a cheap, great way to find out about Floyd and how they started -n- everything, this cd comes with a great book, easy to understand with great pics"
4,Educational Animals,I bought these for my granddaughter and she loves them. It's nice to have something for her to play with that requires her to use her imagination!
4,Great collection.,Hours of fun. The legs are a little weak on some of the longer legged animals. You have to re bend them sometimes to get them to stand again. Good quality product overall.
3,Fun,The horse is his favorite.The sheep looks a bit more like a mountain ram than a sheep so it's not quite a farm animal.

5,This One's Another Keeper!,"If you've never believed in love at first sight, you will after you read this. Sheridan Delaney, spit-fire, always in trouble, speaks her mind, beautiful, stubborn and runs headlong into one big Handsome Devil! Not only is he handsome but a tender wonderfully sensitive man. Wow! Stand by for ignition! These two were absolutely meant for each other, as Nicholas' endearing cousin Jules knew. Dialog aplenty, that will have you on the floor and laughing so hard the tears will come down your face. But that's not all, throw in a deaf butler, an oriental gardner/houseboy, a wacky aunt and a feisty uncle... and Scally - well you're going to have to read the book to find out about him! Lord what an amazing cast of characters to support this wonderful romance from the extremely capable and talented hands of Melanie George. This one is a real keeper and on my list of all time favorites to re-read again and again!"
2,"No more brogue, please!","The chances of a proper Englishwoman befriending an Irish woman from a shantytown in Boston, thus enabling her to meet a rich hunk in London, is a little far-fetched. Still, that I can forgive.What I can't accept is page after page after boring page of Irish colloquialisms. A tip for new writers--one or two sentences is cute, but after that it's just downright annoying. If this author were a new writer, this book probably would not have been accepted in its current form. Take out the extra space occupied by dialect and the book would have been shorter by at least 50 pages, which would have been a large improvement as well.Take away the reason for my complaints above, and I could have rated this at 4 stars."
3,NOT AS GOOD,"This story was not nearly as good as Devil May Care by MG. It just doesn't have the heart. It also doesn't have interesting secondary characters like Devil May Care. Maybe the problem is our hero and heroine get sexually involved with each other too quickly. I like a slower build up and a little more seduction. It's an okay read, but buy it used."
5,LOTS of fun!!!,"I have yet to read an author who writes as funny as Melanie George -- and in an historical, no less! Her books are not your *standard* format romance, and I'm so glad I found her. I can't wait to see what she comes up with in the future. This is one talented author and I feel she could easily go in any direction she chooses."
5,Sensodyne brand Original formula works the best for sensitive teeth,"I've been using Sensodyne for many years and it is the best toothpaste for sensitive teeth due to root exposure, but it has become more difficult to find in drug and food stores these days, maybe because there are so many other toothpaste out there that claim to relieve sensitive teeth. Sensodyne Original formula is the only one that works for me. Finding it at Amazon was a blessing because not only is it more reasonably priced, now I don't have to go searching from place to place where I purchased it before only to find the small amount of stock they carried either sold out or was unavailable now. I've tried other brands and other formulas of Sensodyne which have the same amount of potassium nitrate (5%), but they just don't work as well, which means I can hardly touch the toothbrush to my teeth. I hope this product stays around because I don't know what I will do without it!"
5,Excellent!,"This has to be one of my favorite Dorothy Garlock stories, outside of the With Hope series. This story is full of exciting twists and turns, with a very spirited and independent female character.There are two very touching and emotional love stories within these pages, that will keep you intrigued to find out what's happening next. At the conclusion of this story, another romance is developing between Maggie and Light... you'll find them next in the follow-up book, ALMOST EDEN."
3,Ok Read,I read this book because dorothy garlock is very creative writer that knows how to write a romance story. The story of Anne Lash was one that I felt was worth reading.
4,Almost Five Stars! Dorothy Garlock Never Fails to Write a Great Book!,Annie Lash is a herione who is beautiful and very passionate and Jefferson Merrick is a handsome and lovable hero!! Great Book!
5,Just Gotta Say...{4-1/2 Stars},"...I'm so glad I didn't look up the rating before I read this or I may have passed it up. Which would have been unfortunate!I won't rehash the synopsis - it's been adequately done - but I do need to say this: a couple reviewers were left with the feeling these two hated each other, (and therefore gave a low rating) I didn't see it that way at all. They simply tried to deny their feelings for each other and resorted to alot of antagonistic banter - which I found to be humorous and most entertaining throughout this sexually intense romance.On that note, I have to recommend you do not pass this by based on reviews alone."
5,Outstanding quality and value,"I couldn't be happier with this setup. I purchased it with a PS01 pop screen (Samson) and it's become my staple for WBT voice-over via Sony Audio Studio. The microphone offers an affordable, authentic representation of the voice.An outstanding value at this price!"
5,"High Quality Product, low price","I am very happy with my new Samson microphone and it actually serves two purposes in our household. My wife uses it to record music and I use it for Web-based rapid eLearning. It's great to have such a versatile microphone that delivers such clean sound. Right out of the box, we were able to connect through our USB port and work with any audio software. The fit and finish makes this package a bargain, plus you have a couple of different choices for how you want to place your microphone onto it's included stand. I have not loaded the software that comes with it yet, because I have my own and it is not necessary to make this microphone function. Great job Samson!!!"
5,Great Value,"Just confirmed what most other reviews agree on: this is a high quality product for its price, while it's only con is the software it comes with, which is not only bad, but also a trial version.The voice over we recorded as a test came out clean and detailed, although I'm sure we still have to fine tune placement and levels to get the best out of it."
2,Absolutely Not For Podcast Recording,"I purchased this microphone because it is marketed to amateur podcasters. I attempted to record my voice in an at-home studio environment utilizing Audacity software on a Mac. While this microphone is a huge upgrade from the built-in microphone in my Macbook, it picked up my voice bouncing off the walls and sounds as small as my hands rubbing and page turning of my notes. This microphone picked up the sounds needed for recording for musical instruments and vocals. Lesson learned: do not use this microphone for recording voice for podcasting. This microphone will be good for recording vocals and instruments for music."
1,not for podcasting,I teach online. This item was purchased strictly for podcasting. The instruction manual is not user-friendly at all - assumes the reader is creating his/her own recording and fluent in musical jargon. Still trying to figure out exactly how to use it for my purpose. Far too technical for someone looking for basic podcasting. I would not recommend this device for podcasting.
1,Piece of junk,"I've been working with my new Samson C01U for the last five hours, and that's enough for me. I've tried it on three different computers--two Windows XP machines and one Vista--and the microphone does not work on any of them. Don't waste your time or money. Maybe I'll get some use out of the aluminum case it came in."
4,"Excellent product, excellent value","It's not often you get a product that's so well engineered and put together that you are genuinely surprised at what you've got for the money. This is a great example. It's clear these guys have thought it through, recognizing the potentially huge market for a quality USB mike yet not taking a short-cut to a cheap and cheerful build. What you have here is a high quality product at a entry price with everything you need. The only thing that annoyed me as a UK user, is that once again it takes a US firm to show that you don't have to rip people off. And you've got to say what a great business strategy, because now I wouldn't hesitate to climb up the product range. If you're after a good quality USB mike, don't even bother looking anywhere else. These guys have it all sewn up and you will not be disappointed."
2,Sound quality not so hot,"This set is nicely contained in a carrying case, etc., but the sound quality of the microphone on my Mac is not suitable for professional level podcasts. Nor was I able to install the software drive that comes with it. Overall, I don't think I will get much use of out of this product."
3,A Decent Mic at a Reasonable Price,"The voice recorded by C01U is satisfactory. I have no doubt that this is a good solution for those who want an affordable USB mic working well with a personal computer at home to get the sound quality normally obtainable only in a professional studio. No extra pre-amplifier or complicated wiring! The ambient noise is rarely picked up; a pleasant surprise! But I doubt if Samson cares about its clients at all. Right after I received this mic, I sent e-mail on Feb. 18th and Mar. 1st asking 2 simple questions and have got no response so far. A very diappointing surprise: How Samsontech ignores the users of their products!"
5,Very good sound from this Mic,For the price this Mic has exceptional quality for what I am using it for. I am a internet radio host and adding this mic to the show has brought a very nice deep and rich sound to my audio My show is called [...] and if you would like to hear this mic in action on a podcast check out all the shows I have done after December 1st 2012
3,Samson USB Mic,"The mic and software, I find the software very hard to us, wait to another program, the mic, I am still working some kinks out, I am not pleased at all with the product. Plus the Company no longer supports it by phone tech only online forms."
5,"This Soap Has It All, Natural, Fragrance Free, Affordable","Who needs to pay $6 for a bar of soap that has carcinogenic perfumes and additives when you can use this super lathering, natural soap for just pennies? Bar has a nice shape, lather is creamy, and the ingredients won't harm you. I have allergies to synthetic fragrances and perfumes and use this soap with no problems, it is safe and gentle."
3,skin reaction,"I was all about the no-frills marketing for this simple soap when I saw it in the grocery store- and much cheaper than other ""natural"" soap products. However, I don't know if it's the high-glycerine content or what, but my skin stings all over when I use it.. like a chemical burn! It's probably an isolated, weird reaction unique to me, given the other reviews, but I figured I'd put it out there. I was bummed I couldn't use the rest of my 3 pack- not even on my hands!"
3,Pretty depressing...,"These stories are interesting to a point but it reads like a collection of obituaries. Every story seems to be about how ""so and so"" died while fishing. I get it...commercial fishing is really dangerous. I can't understand why they do it. And this book hasn't helped me understand it any better."
4,Playhouse fun,"My two year old loves this toy. It is easy to carry and set up the different ""rooms."" It has many little spaces for the characters to play in. She likes to put them to bed or let them play with their toys.I gave 3 stars for durablity because the bed and the doors do come off easily, but snap back into to place quickly.I gave it 4 stars for fun because it is played with often.I like that it folds up small and is easy to take in the car."
3,poor motor,A vacuum always works well when its brand new. Once time goes by however you start to notice things. After a year the motor on mine got really loud almost to a scream. I had to replace it at a cost of over $100 cdn. Suction is good and the true HEPA filter is the best on these vacuums. It is where is should be on the exaust where all the air passes through back into your home.
3,detlef buettner is better,Check out life size fish. Detlef paints fish life size. His water color paintings look like photographs. Detlef is a fisheries biologist and works as a fish biologist for alaska fish and game. He's the real thing
2,two stars for effort,"i agree with the previous reviewer that whoever wrote the 5 star review must know someone in it or been affiliated with the movie. the acting is absolutely horrible, dialogue bad and characters not likeable. the computer graphics are pretty cool and that's one of the problems. the edited in graphic action does not blend in with the live action. it's like there are two different movies going on. they should of just did the whole movie animated. the editing is fair and the ending is poor. it's also full screen. overall though it's a good effort for an independent movie. clearly it took a long time to do with a lot of effort."
1,let's be honest,"Though it's not illegal to outright lie and call this childish, amateurish sci-fi travesty a 5 star movie, it is, at the very least, immoral. You should be ashamed."
2,Description is not accurate!!,"The name of this product is ""Disney Cars 8 Re-Useable McQueen & Tow Mater Rings"". However, the Product Features and Product Description sections both state there are 12 rings in the pack. Specifically, there are 6 McQueen and 6 Mater rings. I just received this product and there are only 8 rings in the pack; 3 McQueen, 3 Mater and 2 WGP. Hopefully, I will be able to reorder more rings and get them here before my son's birthday party at school on Tuesday. The features and description sections need to be corrected to the reflect the actual product being sold!!!"
4,Cute - but numbers wrong,"The rings were cute and quality as expected. However, the description lists 12 per pack, but we only received 8."
4,cars cupcake ring favors,the rings were great for the cupcakes and went perfectly with Lighting McQueens cake that I made for a baby shower the kids that were there really liked getting a little gift with their cupcakes some ate more than one so they could get a different ring
3,Cars Party Rings,"Rings are much sturdier than the one's we've had in the past, so don't break as easily. The kids always like rings...for a day, then it's hit or miss. But it's fun for the day for my 4-year old!"
4,Another tool,"I live in a retirement community and help maintain residents' computers. Frequently, it is necessary to make up an ethernet cable. This tool is essential to test the cable to make sure the terminals are on correctly."
2,Door exploded after using it only 4 times!,"I got this unit for Christmas this year and at first I was generally pleased with its performance despite the ugly silver painted plastic. Then today I turned it on to preheat it, left the kitchen for a moment and heard a crash. Returned to find the glass door had exploded and sprayed glass bits all over my kitchen. B&D office is closed today so I can't contact them about this yet."
1,Add me to the List of EOOs (Exploding Oven Owners),"Mine exploded last night! It never toasted worth a flip anyway, but made heating the kids' pizza an easier (and cheaper) experience. I haven't contacted B&D yet, but if they send me another one, I'll give it a shot. I'll just put a rope around the counter to keep the kids away."
4,Great Fights and Filming,Amazing fight scenes and great filming. It has a low budget feel but was really enjoyable to watch because of the great fighting.
5,Blade Warrior,"Very Creatively filmed, I liked the cinematography, and the fight scenes were really cool!!! Despite the budget, this is a well made film."
3,Not Harry Nilsson,"This is a CD single by a Dutch group called ""Nilsson"" (after Pippi Longstocking's pet monkey). It is not by Harry Nilsson."
3,totally sad,This DVD is one giant stereotype of black and Hispanic inner city culture (mainly black). If what you crave is watching ignorant worthless trash degrade their race and self deprecate themselves then this DVD is for you. Once you have seen a few segments you have seen them all.
2,Nice for fans to have,"I don't give this book an average rating based upon the actual stories, which are fine examples of Lovecraft's best, but for Joshi's paltry annotations. I didn't buy this book for the stories, which can be found in almost any Lovecraft anthology, but for the information about Lovecraft. Somehow I was expecting more, perhaps exerpts from Lovecraft's letters, explaining his frame of mind while writting the stories, or more references to his other works. Instead, the reader gets definitions of eldritch and cyclopean, and a glossed over explanation that Lovecraft was no more racist than anyother New Englander in the 1920's.All in all, it's neat to have on the shelf, if you're a fan, but you can get as much information reading the introductions to other collections."
4,A Forgotten Genius,"Lovecraft may have died penniless, but this is not reflected in his work, which at it's best is creative genius. The useful notes included in this edition, will greatly assist the new reader in understanding ideas, themes, and background to many of his tales. Put simply, this is one of the most intriguing and insightful books that delves into the psyche of the author, and will have you investigating the boundaries of the imagination. Excellent!"
1,Insignia IS-PD10135,"I have this DVD player, a gift from my family last April, 2005. I haven't played more than 12 movies on it. Around the 5th or 6th movie, the screen would freeze. I had to reboot the player and select the scene in order to get back to where it froze up. Dec. 10, 2005 it froze again and now it won't load the movie. From doing some research on the web, it appears there are many others with exactly the same problem. You get the run around from both Best Buy and Insignia, no customer support. They continue to market this unit with a design flaw. In case you don't know, Insignia is a Best Buy in-house Brand.It looks good in the store but won't last - believe me. Save your money. I recommend that you stay away from this brand as it is junk."
2,Serious design flaws,"Here's some brilliance in design. You can only adust the the color, hue, etc without a disk in the system and the arrow buttons on the player are for menu navigation only. Can only rewind/FF using the remote.Let's use logic, you may never adjust the color, etc because who wants to keep inserting a disk to see how you did. You'll always use Rew/FF yet those buttons aren't even on the player only the remote.Inexpensive doesn't have to mean lousy design...except in this case. I accept the fact I made a bad decision even though I went down and checked it out with a dvd. Just assumed the arrow buttons on the player were Rew/FF.Nice picture for the price though and I wouldn't have bought anything smaller anyway."
3,Audio noise problems,"Overall I'm pleased with this DVD player except for the annoying audio noise issues. Sometimes the audio is okay but often it exhibits a very annoying level of background electrical noise. I'm glad I spent extra for an extended warranty on this. Normally I never buy extended warranties but I suspected that with an el-cheapo off brand like Insiginia, I might need it. I was right! This is going back for exchange as soon as I can find the extended warranty and receipt. Hopefully the replacement will be better. Caveat Emptor."
4,Question about format?,I have had this DVD player for about 2 years now and I love it! It works great!! But I do have a question if anyone knows? Does anyone know if it will play Region 2 DVDs? As in DVD's from the UK or the Netherlands? I've had it play alot of DVD's that other players won't play so I was just wondering if it will play those! Thanks for any help!
4,Right price for simple locks,"These locks were fine for our needs. We never carry valuable items when we travel. We were looking for a simple key lock to hold the zippers shut and this more than fit the bill. They have already survived a few vacations and not having to deal with a combination was wonderful, Are they the best lock you can get?-No. But they are good enough to keep random fingers at the airport out."
1,Inadequate,"These are very poor quality locks, and provide close to no assurance of durability. On first use, I was glad to see them on the luggage when I landed; but one of them literally came apart in my hands when I tried to unlock! Would highly recommend against these."
4,Works great!,Used it in Europe while traveling... worked fine. Never tried it thru the airport security tho.
3,Mildly Interesting,"Only mildly interesting to serious students of politics, but probably of considerable interest to young women looking for good stories about successful women who have overcome substantial obstacles."
4,video 5-8-6: the new order blueprint,"a track that offers fresh remanisance of new order's classic disco enigma. the escalating 23 minute instrumental is as allusive as its packaging and cover design. very little information is included. in fact, does anyone really know what song it is anyway? the producer states on its website that it's an early recording that gave birth to new order's blue monday, it doesn't sound anything like 5-8-6, and it sounds to me like the same backbone for both blue monday and confusion."
5,Some info,I read somewhere that this song was used at the opening of the Hacienda club in Manchester while images where projected on screens. A nice addition to any NO collection.
3,"I expected better quality, truth be told.","I bought this as gift for my husband. Bear in mind that he's a software engineer; he's not exactly rough on jewelery/clothes.It was lighter in color than the picture depicts, and the leather strap is not as thick as I had hoped. It does sit nicely on one's wrist though, and the face is easy to read.However, it broke after a week of use (the pin holding the face to the strap snapped), and it now sits in drawer collecting dust. (he has another watch he uses)I like the design, but I would not recommend this product."
2,"2 Stars for presentation only - the rest is science guess work, speculative nonsense","Yes, a great looking documentary without a shadow of a doubt. But as is the case in any film which attempts to travel back in time - it's unreliable. What they teach as truth today will be thrown out of the window tomorrow. The fact is: Nobody was there 4 billion years ago and it's all guesswork on the evidence they have NOW.It will have you believe that ALL scientists agree that this was the way it all happened, but it gives you absolutely no clue that the scientific community is completely split.But again we are asked to worship at the alter of these great scientists who know everything, who are we to argue? So long as these productions keep people brainwashed with flashing lights and handy camerawork, it's all good for the sad demi-gods who arrogantly assume to know everything.Complete garbage."
3,Pretty Ok,I wish someone had told me the narrator sounded like Shrek. This was a decent movie. I bought it to show my college-level landform geography course. My only complaint would be that the narrator used watered-down terminology instead of proper terms.
4,A good entry-level DVD on Earth History,"This is a good entry-level DVD on Earth history. I have a geology degree and so was curious to see what this was about. It is reasonably factual, even though it glossed over a few things I thought should have been covered a bit further - like differing views on ""Snowball Earth"". Dr Stewart explained things fairly well, and the shots of the volcanoes, etc., were interesting. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in Earth History.Cons:Dr Iain Stewart himself. He is no where near the level of a presenter like David Attenborough, and he came across to me as a simpleton at times.Only one view is presented, areas of controversy such as ""Snowball Earth"" and first ""animals"" (there are much earlier critters than the ones in Australia) are glossed over."
3,Photobook Angkor,"Angkor, Celestial temples of the Khmer Empire is a photobook limited to the Angkor Site and some outlining temples. Although the quality of the photo's is excellent, the book itself with regards to the informative value is disappointing. An exception to this is the chronology of sites.Angkor: Temples et monumentsThe Treasures of Angkor: Cultural Travel Guide (Rizzoli Art Guide)Angkor: Cambodia's Wondrous Khmer Temples, Fifth Edition (Odyssey Illustrated Guide)Ancient Angkor (River Book Guides)Angkor Cities and Temples"
5,I have Jon Ortner book,"ANGKOR: Celestial Temples of the Khmer Empire,This is an excellent book I ordered online about when I first came out about a year ago. You will not go wrong with this book. Every pages I leafed through is highly insprirational. The photographs are very breath-takingly welldone. I like the chapter on the Preah Vihear(PV) temple. Again, nicely illustrated and photographed on PV. There's also a section on Cambodian temples that are in Thailand and Laos.Athough the book is large--oversize, but worth its weight in gold on your bookself !"
4,Very Good Info,"For the lay person, very well written book for those needing to understand how and why their bodies are acting a particular way. The algorithm might be slightly confusing but once you figure it out, it can lead women to a better treatment plan for assisting with her symptoms."
3,discover your menopause type.,"I found the first half of book very interesting, it was very gripping and i felt i couldnt put the book down and then when it got to the testing part of book, i was totally lost. I found it very confusing and actually stopped reading at this point. Not what i thought it was going to be.!!!!!!!!"
2,Clear Vinyl Front,"Be sure and read the product description carefully because from the picture and the listed product features, one could think the entire gown was natural canvas. I wanted canvas so the garment could breathe. I was very disappointed when I received it with an entire vinyl front."
4,Good program,"This is a wonderful production of a story book read aloud by the rich voice of Morgan Freeman accompanied by the catchy melodies of Taj Mahal. Great combo and good story! I show this to my 4th graders, and they are enchanted!"
2,Outdated and difficult to use,I was really disappointed in the usefulness of this reference. Many current tests were not included in this book. The organization of the book was very poor and even common tests were difficult to locate. I wound up buying another book.
3,Tarot: Mirror of Your Relationships,"If you are looking for a book to gain deeper insight into your relationship with a particular person or circumstance, this is it. I would use this book as a compliment to Ziegler's other book Tarot: Mirror of the Soul because this book does not focus on you as an individual, it really is meant for you to divinate greater understanding about you in conjunction with the other-whoever that may be. The Crowley deck couldn't ask for a better versed interpreter than Ziegler especially when it comes to the relationship aspects of each card because he seems to have put quite a bit of thought into what the symbolism is trying to tell us. If your relationships do not grow through use of this book, then your relationship with the universe certainly will due to the positive flavor of its message."
2,looks good,looks good but the foaming or cushing or whatever u want to call it is not comforting at alli am in the look out for another new set of glasses
4,Nice movie,I liked how Jeremy Jordan is different from the pop star image on his album. He's more dressed down and innocent so it's very sweet and cute. I think Jeremy Jordan fans will like it and maybe even love it. Nice little movie that you just might enjoy.
3,Di'zWi'z Showbiz,"There was a lot of hard work and love put into this film. However, for me it did not show. The use of red & picture framing did not read for me either.I also could not get into the two main characters.I do own the DVD and will have to give it another look.For me the film was gloomy and slow.Rent it before you buy it.Di'zWi'z Showbiz"
1,Not what it seems!!!!,"I guess there are 1000's of movies like this in the video stores that noone wants to rent. The title is unattractive and conveys the film maker's state of mind-----dreamer. The concept and storytelling are not original, a little bit of this and that, here and there: such a stereotype film-making technique from some amateurs who are trying to overwhelm the viewers with such mediocre production. Low budget is not an issue here though, but the movie does look low budget, simply because the story itself is insufficient to augment a low budget production. The writer (from China) obviously does not understand the thinking of typical Americans and how Americans perceive Hollywood. Anyway...I find this flick completely overrated."
4,"Funny, sad, and funnier!","The story of a bachelor's dog - funny funny funny!Read carefully, as many issues of bachelorhood and dogdom are explored with side splitting humor.My dog liked it so much he chewed up the corner of the mag."
5,What Australia Has To Offer,"It would be wrong to analyse 'Australian Music' as a music catagory all on its own, we have so many types of music here plus Australia also produces way good hip hop beats! Resin Dogs are an absolute favourite, they are fun, funky and greatly appreciated by their live Australian audiences... if you were to purchase some Hip Hop with Australian flava dont go past this record cuz it literally holds the tracks of the future!"
5,Delivers what it promises,"A wonderful, relaxing yet invigorating, safe and effective workout for people who already know at least the basics of belly dance and just want to move for an hour. Structured so you can really sweat if you want to put more work into it, or just settle into a nice groove and work out the kinks.The dancers look like normal women, even a bit on heavy side, which is refreshing! I wish this instructor had more videos to offer."
4,Delightful,"This is a truly magical English movie. It is the story of a boy who has recently lost his mother. Whilst out exploring he has a bag containing millions land on his playhouse; this story is his journey to make the world a better place by distributing the money to those less fortunate while his brother is trying to use the money to make his own world better. It is funny and sad, has lovely fantasy scenes where Saints pop in for a chat and help the boy along his journey. I highly recommend this family movie."
4,Excellent resource for children,"This is an excellent resource for children ages 9-12 who are interested in space. This full-color photographs are eye-catching and the text is interesting and informative. This book could be useful as a resource for research, but it may be limited if the research were too indepth. Overall, this is an excellent book and would make a good addition to a children's library collection, a classroom collection or a home collection."
4,Interesting developing story.,"This is an interesting movie to watch. Although it is just typical thriller movie. This is much better than perfect stranger with Hollywood super star. The movie like a play made on film. Everything happens in the villa or the hotel. I borrowed it from a public library, so it is good to watch."
5,The best!,"This rock shoe is wonderful, ultra confortable and perfect to rock climbing even indoors climbing too. Very good price and very nice design"
5,stay's put,great case!! Will stay where you but it you do not have to worry about lossing your phone! just the right size.
3,Good but Not Great,"I bought this case to use with my Sony-Ericsson W580i cell phone. It does work with this phone (and in fact AT&T; sells this case for more at their website and lists is as being compatible with this phone) but there is about a half inch of extra space in depth inside the case. In other words, you could put two of these phones in the case, that's how much extra space there is.The case is well made, but annoying. The belt clip is hard to get off of your belt. It does NOT swivel as some other people have indicated. The belt clip is plastic and has a lip (or hook) on the underside to grab your belt. The problem is that it won't let go easily so taking it off is a real problem. I've had many belt clips before and have worried that some might come off. That won't happen with this one. It is too good at gripping.Additionally, the velcro flap doesn't line up well with the main case, so you only get about 40% coverage.Overall, I would get a different case if I had to do it over."
4,"Govinda is the best,",Another Govinda-Vimal Kumar thriller after Dulaara This film revolves around Govinda who unintentionally murdered his uncle who tried to rape his aunt.One day he meets Seema who is a mentally challenged girl who was in love with Govinda's look alike and when she sees Govinda she assumes him to be her lover.Govinda falls in love with her and she becomes well Then Govinda tells her about the murder and is shocked to find out that she is an undercover cop who wanted his confession The rest of the movie is when Govinda finds out that his uncle was murdered by someone else and his search for the real culprit Govinda shows his talent here Shilpa Shetty also excels in her role as the cop Kader Khan is Okay Sadashiv and Aruna Irani are really scary as the villains excellent movie
3,APC Battery,"This APC battery works well. I ordered two batteries. One of them was fine, but the other one was not fully charged."
3,APC no longer recycles,I am sure the quality of the battery is fine but I am most disappointed that APC no longer supplies a return label for battery recycling. I see no reason to pay more for their battery any more.
2,It works but...,On my third battery in 4 years. Not sure if the UPS is no good or the batteries are. According to the mfg these should last 3-5 years... no where even close. The battery is a good fit and does work just not for long. Am shopping for another brand of UPS.
1,"Amazon shipping ""ABC"" knockoff batteries instead of official APC!","We ordered 2 of these APC batteries. We received 1 APC, and another one from a company called ""ABC"" that looks like a cheap knock-off.I couldn't believe Amazon was shipping a knockoff after we purchased the original. So I requested a replacement. They apologized and sent one out.We received it, and guess what, it's another ABC battery! I complained again, and this time the guy admits if he orders another replacement, it'll probably happen again, so he's just going to give us a refund!WTF, why doesn't someone at Amazon ask themselves why they are shipping knock-off products as real products? If I was APC, I would be pissed."
3,I did (very mildly) electrocute myself with this fine lead-acid product.,"The warnings and other instructions were not quite clear or well presented enough that I was not able to give myself a little zap while reinstalling this battery into the UPS.May this be my warning to anyone else out there who does not want a fairly harmless electrical grounding: study the ponderously overwritten instructions included with this unit better than I did! O, the huge-manatee."
3,"Good for It's Time, Overwritten By Today's Standards","I know kicking Washington Irving is a little unfair since he wrote when the standards for popular fiction were much different than they are today.The ""Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" is an interesting tale, full of notable and interesting characters. Irving is very good at description and Ichabod Crane, his future (hopefully) father in law, his intended and his competitor for the young lady's attentions are all well sketched.This book is very floridly written. Long paragraphs are given over to minute descriptions that just don't appear in today's fiction. To those nurtured on 20th Century prose, the contrast makes Irving's stories seem turgid and very slow moving. You can recognize Irving's talent with words and long sentences in the writing -- unfortunately those very talents interfere with the pace and presentation of the underlying story."
4,Exquisite photos of dolls across time and cultures,"Lovely short overview of types of dolls across history and cultures, in the ""World of Difference"" series, which ""explores how everyday objects and activities can reflect one's culture."" A 32-page hardcover on glossy paper, it beautifully reproduces photos with some exquisite examples, such as an 1850 Marie-Therese of Austria doll and a gorgeous manipuri dancer doll from India. History and composition, realistic dolls, dolls in ceremony and ritual are all covered. Heavy on the illustration, succinct and professional in the text. A good book for 3rd or 4th grade reports."
3,"Folksy, Practical . . . Very Sweet","The tone of this book is as lovely as I'm sure the author/innkeeper is. She's experienced at her business and her craft of teaching the art of owning a Bed and Breakfast.This is one of many books you should purchase/read if you are interested in this field. Look for others (So-You Want to Be an Innkeeper: The Definitive Guide to Operating a Successful Bed-And-Breakfast or Country Inn, for example) for more hard-core business advice, and I'm Living Your Dream Life: The Story of a Northwoods Resort Owner, for true a taste of owner experience in the business"
5,Wonderful & Just a little Unusual,"This will indeed sound strange: I am preferentially a vegetarian (which means that I love and prefer vegetables and such, but will also occasionally eat meat, but only if it's wonderful and worth it). ""Worth it"" does not begin to describe some of this food! I am also an experienced cook and a total foodie who owns several hundred well-used cookbooks, and I just loved this book. I received it as a gift and happily sat up half Christmas night just reading it and drooling. Marvelous information! Marvelous recipes! Excellent writing! If you've never experimented with cooking with bones--you must try. It's classic cuisine but somewhat unusual now in home kitchens. (How many people do you know who would recognize, let alone own a marrow spoon?) I loved this book SO much that I have now myself given it as a gift to the two best cooks I know--and I didn't wait for their birthdays or Xmas to roll around, either!"
2,Just a cookbook,"Bones: Recipes, History, and LoreI received both of the books Fat and Bones for Christmas. I read Fat first and it was outstanding! So I think my low number of stars (2) may be because Bones is nowhere near as informative as Fat. We ""learn"" that the reason to include bones is to increase flavor. And then there are a number of interesting recipes for meat on-the-bone and for stock. The margins are filled with bone-lore, similar to the fat-lore that was included in Fat. But there was a lack of health information about bones, and there was little about actually consuming bones. Since I know of people who make bone pate (from organic, grassfed animals), this was a notable omission. Had I known it was basically a cookbook, I would not have requested it as a Christmas gift."
2,Not what I was looking for,"This book is simply a cute little cook-book. It's weak on the diversity of edible-preparations. Sure, there are a few play-offs of different ethinic variations. Not very heavy on the history or lore either. With that said, the recipes included and the pictures are mouth-watering. If you have money and like cook-books, consider the purchase. If money isn't as readily available as it once was, you could definitely get by without the book."
5,Yum!,"Yum! This book is full of great information, tutorials, illustrations and recipes for a delicacy most people never experience. My sister, who is a gourmet cook, will love this book."
2,21st Century Folk Posturing,"NPR gave Jennings a nice plug in January and it was on the strength of that review and interview that I purchased this CD in hopes of hearing one of the fresh new voices of this generation. What I heard was heavy-handed skin-deep Folkie posturing and middling musicianship. Advertised as a ""voice"" of 20somethings, I was disappointed that Jennings has nothing to say about the events going on around him -- or even those of the past decade. His songs retreat to the safety of tired 1960s coffehouse folk anthems: Vietnam and Martin Luther King. Hard to say anything new on these topics but it gives the illusion of depth, and this album needs all the illusions that such themes can conjure."
4,Gooooooooood stuff,"One thing that really annoys me is when people constantly write reviews in which they compare one artist to another. I mean, I like Elliott Smith, too, but it would be ridiculous to say that Mason Jennings is ""like"" Elliott Smith. Can we, perhaps, rise to the challenge of saying something original about the artist without drawing invidious comparisons? Let me tell you a story about this cd, instead. Just about two and a half years ago, I was living in Minneapolis, moving out of a much-beloved apartment after a not-so-beloved period in my life. ""Train Leaving Gray"" came on the radio (a live, studio version prior to the cd's release). I put the broom down in my now-empty apartment and cried. May you be lucky enough to have such an experience. Really pretty songs; really scary songs; really real songs."
4,by Payton White,"This book Ben and Me by Robert Lawson is about a mouse named Amos that's so full of himself. You won't ever guess who he lives with. He lives with Ben Franklin. They go on so many adventures during the book. One of the most interesting things in the book is when Ben Franklin tied Amos to a kite during a thunderstorm. So what do you think happend? In my opinion the book is great, interesting, and curious. It will keep you reading.I say this because it kept me reading. I loved it."
3,Ben and me,"The book Ben and Me, written by Robert Lawson, is about a mouse named Amos who meets Ben Franklin.And has a aswome adventure.One of the most interesting things in the book is when Ben tries to show the people that he can make electricity and shocks the govener.In my opinion about the book is great because I think it is interesting."
4,Good,This book arrvied in a timely manner. we needed it for school and got it quickly. My son enjoyed reading it. This book was in great shape.
5,Ben & Me: Wonderful,"This has always been a favorite story, from as early as I can remember. My hope is that others will share it with their young children for the adventure, the wit, the unleashed imagination and to form some sort of introduction to Ben Franklin, albeit just a work of fiction."
4,my review,"The book Ben and Me, written by Robert Lawson is about a mouse named Amos who meets Ben Franklin. One of the most interesting things in the book is the war. In my opinion the book is good because a lot of interesting stuff happen. I say this because there is a lot of funny stuff. I love the pictures."
5,Ben and me,The book Ben and Me written by Robert Lawson is about Ben Franklin and a mouse named Amos. One of the most interesting things in the book is the woman with the hairstyle. In my opinion the book is the best book I have ever read.I say this because it is true. It is a pretty good book. In the last chapter it shows a war.
3,Great Child Story!,"I read this book in Fifth Grade and enjoyed it. It is great how the author made the story from a mouse's point of view. I would of never thought of that. This book was also made into a short Disney movie. The movie is definatly no subsitute for the book, though. The movie leaves out the best part of the story!"
3,Fairly good book,This book was pretty good but its not an attention grabber. I had to read this for a school assignment and it wasn't a book that I would normally read. It was boring but educational.
1,Don't bother reading,It was a complete waste of time reading this book.I found it to be totally unimaginative and poorly written.There are much better children's books about Ben Franklin out there.Save your money and time.
3,Ben and Me,"Ben and Me was great in the end, but you have to be patient in the beginning because it is not very interesting. For example, in the beginning all it tells us is about Ben's life. Ben is sort of inarticulate and Amos, the talking mouse, is funnier than Ben. We said that the end is great because there is a happy ending. We would recommend it to people who like strange humor."
1,Franklin EBM-911 reader,The Franklin 911 was a gift. What a mistake! The promise on the box was that it would be compatable with Microsoft Reader soon. That is why I was sold on this reader. I kept checking with Franklin as to when Microsoft reader was going to be part of their system. Boy was I disappointed when they finally came out and said we've decided NOT to add Microsoft reader. Well that was it for me and this product. Without Microsoft's reader this product is almost worthless. The book selection is small and not up to date. So If I were someone looking at readers this one would be one to stay away from. My franklin reader is just gathering dust as I speak........
1,Dissappointed,Very dissappointed with product. Very difficult to setup an costly to setup. More cost efficient to purchase more expensive book readers after having to purchase all the additional items (i.e. MMC card (which is hard to find) and adapter. Also found books for this reader cost more money than the other readers.
2,Not ready for prime time ... beta software.,"This unit is ok to use as an ebook reader maybe but not as an PIM device. The screen is larger and the backlight is much better than the Palms.There is no shipping software or manual. The Mp3 music is really hard to hear using the build in speaker. The voice recorder software is not out yet.Worst yet once you remove/replace the batteries, the operating system is gone. You have to resync it with your pc cradle. The pc cradle is not well designed. You need to use both hands to operate it.The software is very buggy. Mine freezed up quite a few times. May be they can fix this in the near future. But I returned mine and continue to use my Palm IIIxe."
1,Poor Design Not Recommended,"I would recommend NOT buying this product. I've had mine for about a year and a half. Since the operating system is not hard-wired, you have to download it from the Franklin website any time the batteries wear down. On sevral occassions, the Franklin website was either down or being serviced, making it impossible to get the os. When everything is operating well it takes upwards of 15 or 20 minutes from a dialup to download. The software supplied is also a bear to work with. This is probably one of the most poorly thought out electronic devices I've ever owned. Am looking at other readers and when I find one I like, the Franklin 911 is going in the garbage."
1,This Is Crap Now,"Service for this device stopped years ago. All of the Ebook services that it provides have abandoned it, so you can't get any books for it anyway. Waste of money, waste of time.DON'T BUY THIS!!!!"
2,why,Does anyone know why the OS won't back up to the MMC card? Why does it have to be loaded every time the battery runs out? I'm trying here because customer service is non-existent.
1,One word...BAD,"This was a total waste of money, as it had data loss time and again, and that was when the thing would work! Do yourself a favor a stay away from this product, or else you will be throwing money away just like me."
1,Dont Waste Your Cash on an Ebookman,"I would have rated this device lower than one star but...it...does not go that low.This device is not worth even considering for a purchase. Franklin has again shown why no one buys their products unless they are desparate. You must download the operating system before you can turn on the device. The screen is too small and not backlit making it totally useless for any purpose including reading any material from ebooks to newspaper subcriptions.The speaker cost about 20 cents.Further, Franklin purportedly has arrangements with mobipocket and audible.com for content. Dont even bother trying to access the content from either of these sources. Their websites are poorly designed and they provide little usable tech support.Moreover, Franklin tries to rip you off for the flash memory you must purchase separately..."
3,Don't lose your CD,"If you lose your CD and you have windows 7, you can't install the drivers for the ebookman through device manager. My CD blew up in my cd rom drive and now I can't use my ebookman. It says it can't find drivers for it. The fact it can't play pdf files really sucks. .txt is fine is you can get a program to change over pdf, but if not you are really limited on books."
1,too much trouble for the price,I bought the ebookman to use as a PDA and for easy access to the Physician Desk REference. Even when not in use the product goes thru batteries faster than I can recharge them. I have had it replaced once and still cannot replace the batteries without losing all the data. I certainly would not but another one.
3,This product is not for the visually impaired,"The idea behind this product is great. I was excited to see that there was a portable e-book reader, but was disappointed when I recieved it. I have a visual impairment and simply could not read the display. It was hard for me to see. I think I would have enjoyed the product if it had a larger screen and text inlarging ability. I am not saying that this is a bad product because it is a great idea. I just wish that Franklin would make a larger book sized model. A Model the size of a Bible or a Guidepost magizine would be nice. Come to think of it, a PDA from Palm, Handspring, etc would be nice as well with larger displays and text enlargement on ALL screens. :)"
2,"Almost a great book reader, but ...","I bought one of the first one of these -- and returned it. It's almost a great book reader, and with the sci-fi e-books at (...) I was looking forward to one of these, however the screen is just too reflective. It's hard to make out the words, and the backlighting is not near as good as on my palm.I liked it because of its screen size meant that it was a better choice for e-books than a traditional pda. I thought that it worked pretty well for its intended purpose. But in the end, the screen was just too hard to read under varying light conditions. If this is fixed, I'd be happy to go back to it.I would pay more for the same unit with an upgraded screen with good backlighting."
4,Cool device for reading books,"I've had my eBookman for 3 weeks now. I'm glad I didn't read the negative reviews here before I purchased or I would have missed out on a cool little eBook reader.Thanks to the MobiPocket reader software there's more and more content becoming available in compatible formats. Checkout Fictionwise. It's also easy enough to convert plain text or html files to the Mobipocket format.The display is quite good for daylight reading, the backlight is good enough to be useable for reading in total darkness, but not bright enough to be useful in dim room light.Before I got it, I was afraid the small screen size would be a problem, but it actually isn't.The battery life isn't great, especially when using the backlight, but I have a couple of pairs of NiMH batteries and frequently swap in a freshly charged set.I'm sure the next generation ebook devices will be better, but this is good enough for now."
3,"Had one, lost it, now I bought a Palm","I had the same problems with the Ebookman. There wasn't enough room to download a whole book, which to me was very inconvenient. I also wanted to use the voice recording feature that they advertised, but it was never available the whole time I had my unit. I also had the same problem every time I changed batteries, about once a month. Lost EVERYTHING everytime. I emailed and talked to Franklin people numerous times, but nothing changed. Then I lost it.....serendipitous? Perhaps. Now I have a Palm M105 on the way."
1,Buy a Palm,"I read mixed reviews on the ebookman. I should have listened. I'm sorry, but this thing is a piece of junk. I have a Palm M500 too, and it is GREAT! The ebook reader in the Palm system is much better, IMO. The ebookman will conk out for no reason, and then you have to reload everything. Batteries go dead, reload everything. It would make a great paperweight. Buy a Palm, be happy."
2,Dissapointed,"I purchased this device to use as a ebook reader. The screen glares so badly I cannot read it. The fonts are not really adjustable. It is difficult and slow to try to turn a page. All the other features are really great, audible book player is is good and address book etc. The display was a big dissapointment."
2,EBOOKMAN 911,"My biggest complaint is that I have never received the rebate. Secondly, the batteries are the next biggest problem. They don't last long and if they die completely so does all your info. I recently lost mine and have had trouble sync all of it back on correctly.Also, it is a long distance call to Franklin Tech support. No 800 number unless you want to buy something - as it always is these days.I like the backlit display and the size of the print."
4,I love this thing,"I love the ebookman 911. The screen is wider than my pda, it's also thinner and less bulky. Plus as an added bonus, it has a nice scroller on the side which makes it a lot easier to turn the page. I also like that you can change the batteries instead of having to wait forever to recharge the darn thing like my pda.My only problem and the reason I didn't give it 5 stars is b/c of the gray screen. It might not bother anyone else but the lack of color bothers me enormously and is the reason I bought my pda in the first place. So while I think the eBookman is great, I wish they would come out with a color version and I would get rid of everything else."
2,Very disappointed,"I had the opportunity to try out the Franklin and the Sony ebook readers and was amazed to find that the Sony is a better overall product. I've always been a big fan of Franklin, but found this particular product to not be user friendly. It would've been better for them to focus on one to three main functions rather than trying to do everything. If I want that much functionality, I can buy a PDA. The batteries required more recharging than I felt comfortable with, considering I planned to use it on long trips where there might not be an easy way to recharge. Overall I was very disappointed with it."
3,Still waiting,"I waited and waited for this thing to come out and now I am still waiting. As mentioned in other reviews the software and features are really still in the beta stage if they exist at all. I too bought a mmc card and can only put ""unsecured music files"" on it-so it is basically worthless until the fix is in. The most disappointing thing for me was the promise of Microsoft reader, but this is not expected until July. I have many Microsoft reader books and was looking forward to them, now I have to wait until July. I am going to keep this becuase it does offer alot of promise, especially in the reader and audiobook features. Although, I cannot use either one at the moment I will wait. So if you can find a good price or rebate it may be worth getting if not it would be best to wait-like I am."
5,Everything a mini-series should be,"When I heard the words ""british TV miniseries"", I was admittedly not expecting much. I was very pleasantly surprised.This miniseries had everything a quality production should have: good cinematography, an excellent script, fully-drawn three-dimensional characters, and a fine slate of actors. Pay particular attention to Jason Isaacs as Michael ""Mickey"" Ryan. Mr. Isaacs, and the movie, were outstanding."
4,Enjoyable British mini-series,"Enjoyable British mini-series relates the story of 20-year-old Maura Ryan, who, after discovering her family's criminal past, teams with her brother to take control of their illegal interests. Together, the pair rule London's underworld...until an unexpected challenge threatens to destroy everything they've built."
5,Great acting,I really enjoyed this movie!Loved Jason Isaacs and Susan Lynch.Definately worth seeing.
3,Enjoyable,Not as good as the old Murphy-Saphir written Destroyer books but still enjoyable. Doesn't have the old spark it once had. I hope that the rumor that Murphy will write some new Destroyer books is true. That would be awesome.
3,OK for a general/first overview of driving,"I purchased this based on the glowing review from ""Driver's Ed Guru."" The DVD is divided into sections which cover basics, city & residential driving, highway driving, safety tips for normal & hazardous conditions, and a drug/alcohol section. Most of the info is available in the regular driver's ed manual but it is informative to see some of the 3D models regarding parking, intersections, etc. The ""Virtual Driver"" interactive section provides an ""inside-the-car"" look and tests you on your surroundings (multiple choice). Unfortunately, my DVD kept freezing on the ""identify the hazard"" section so I couldn't get through the whole program. It might just be my computer though. Overall review: Good for beginners, but doesn't provide any groundbreaking information. There is an updated 2-disc version of this available now, which is supposed to have more info but I haven't purchased that so I can't comment on the differences between the old and new editions."
3,Disappointing,"I bought this based on positive reviews from collegues, but was disappointed when I received it. The questions posed were not challenging."
2,Don't Buy This Read The Manual Instead,"Cheesey video, bad interface, offers little instruction, tests are too easy to be useful. Save the money and go take a driving lesson from a licensed instructor instead. We purchased this to help with parallel parking. The topic is mentioned on the video but there is virtually no instruction. And so it goes with most of the other topics....."
3,Good Road Rule Review for TV learners,"A friend lent this to me as I was doing research for my audio CD for safe driving ""Mind the Road"" -Mind the Road: Waking Hypnosis for a Conscious Commute. Its not the best quality instructional video, but it captures the important points and is worth the price for those people who learn more by watching TV then reading books/manuals"
1,lame driver ed video,"I bought this DVD for my 16yo son and previewed it. It is SO lame that I hesitate to even give it to him. The kids are so scrubbed and clean-cut as to be nauseating even to me. the cuts to a state trooper are largely purposeless..he sounds unscripted, COPS video where it is shot from the front seat and he never looks at the camera (he is driving while talking!) and the material he delivers has NO relationship to what they just interrupted. The questions are so general as to be obvious without any attention to the video. NOT a good effort. Save your money. ""Death on the Highway"" 30 years ago got your attention, this doesn't."
3,Not bad,"Good for supplemental material, more ""action"" scenes would have made it better, could get boring for younger studentsin class"
5,Excellent,My daughter failed the test to get her driving permit. I bought her this DVD and she watched it one day and passed the driving permit test the next day. Much cheaper then drivers ed.
4,My wife bought this program for our kids,"and I have to admit that it's not half bad for a drivers ed video. The graphics are nice and all the information you're looking for is easy to find. The multiple choice question quizzes are easy, but not half bad for preparing for the test I suppose."
4,Good but not great,"I bought this having heard wonderful things about it, but have to say I was a bitdisappointed. I thought it a tad dull, though Herb and Dorothy are amazing people.The film tended to be repetitious, I thought. But overall, it was definitely worth seeing!"
5,Generosity,"The movie treats its subjects with the same intelligent reverence that the Vogels devoted to the artists and the work they collected. It is a film about insight, wisdom and beneficial obsession."
4,Interesting portrait of working class art collectors,"This is the story of Herb, a postal worker, and his wife Dorothy, a NYC librarian. It shows how they live, obtain their collection, store it in their tiny apartment, and eventually dispense of it. I believe this movie will only be enjoyed by art-lovers. For those both interested and not in art, I highly recommend ""The Art of the Steal,"" the true and captivating story about Dr. Barnes and his collection, and the power struggle over it."
5,Best in art,This amazing couple is an example to be followed. How inspiring their lives! How cute at this age! Thank you Megumi Sasaki for introduce them. Congratulations!
2,comic book like screenplay worsened with bad acting,"and cliched plot. the whole movie was like a comic book. a tiny weeny japanese waiter became an accidental tourist in hongkong after he was fired in japan's restaurant, then....well, i've already suffered a loss of about 2 hours of my lifetime, you think i'd be stupider to write a full review of this bad movie? you want me to stand on the treetop like what they did in this film and 'crouching tiger and hidden dragon' or play some cgi or gif graphic stunt like reeves did in the 'matrix'? well, i won't do it. period."
3,A little disappointing,"I loved the original ""Children's Ministry That Works"" book. I assumed that the updates of this book would only improve the content. However, I was wrong. They took out valuable information proved to be an excellent teaching tool and replaced it with ""just stuff."" This book was a big disappointment to me."
4,Good Stuff,"This book has helped me to develop a mission statement for the children's ministry at our church, and gave me some good pointers for vbs."
5,The best,"Unlike some other brands these stickers are actually stickers, meaning it won't fall down from the item or label that you stickered a minute before, its a good sticker and does its job, Highly recommend, especially if you sell on amazon and you have to sticker your products"
2,"It's watchable,","but the film is ultimately just OK. Mira is the high point, but even her performance is just lukewarm. The wiseguys as well as her friends are all overdone. The task she's forced into (thanks, meathead spoilers, for ruining it for some people)is more or less pure nonsense ... no mob guy worth his salt would've done that to her. Truly. Even the Sopranos teaches you that. The whole thing just isn't believable, and the subplot about the ""secret"" is overdone and underbaked as well. Mariah's role? To be perfectly honest, the best thing about her presence was how sexy she looked in those short tight dresses. Yes, this is the finest performance she's done on film to date, but considering Glitter, that ain't saying much. She just cannot act. Her accent sounded faked and she was WAY too dramatic. This is good to catch on cable or if you pick it up cheap somewhere."
3,Straight to TV???,"I was in total shock when I saw this movie on MAX this past weekend. I thought it was Mariah Carey's third chance on the big screen (The Bachelor, Glitter, Wisegirls) and after all the excellent reviews at Sundance, I thought it was going to be her way of reinvidicate after the failure of Glitter. I guess the distributors thought she was worn out!!!"
2,Is It a Mariah Carey movie or is It a Real film?,"A soggy melodrama that comes across a a bad b soap opera.Mira Sorvino is wasted here in a script that has potential but just turns into acomplete unbelievable mess. Mariah Carey gives a better performance then in that dreadful ""Glitter"" but she can't.. Act that is. Die hard Fans of Carey will love this wreck or anything she does good - Bad or just pain terrible. This film is in between bad and terrible.Check out the first mob guy Sorvino meets at her job interview for witnessing.Very BADDDD.The ending had to be one of the worst seen in a long time...sooo unbelievable!"
4,recommended movie!,"I love Mariah Carey, and I was surprised to see Mariah is playing this kind of role in a relatively minor movie. I think it was a good charater for Mariah to play. There was some cheezy moment, but overall. Mariah did a great job! She could be a good actress, and hope she will come out on more movies in the future.Story line was nice too, unpredictable outcome, and I was absorbed into the story. It made me cry at the end. Nice movie. You should watch it."
5,Excellent Movie!! A Must-See!!!,"This is a great movie!! The acting is amazing! Mariah does a VERY VERY VERY good job! Don't be disuaded by ""Glitter"". Mira is awesome as well... This movie is definitely recommended!"
4,Nice Job - I recommend a watchin!,"Hey, not a bad flick. This movie deserves watchin. You will be entertained by the twists in the plot, and the drama that unfolds. Mariah does a great job, and demonstrates that she can ACT; she was very believable. I just loved her charector -Raychel. Mira did a nice job as well. I think Melora could have worked it a bit more, but I was not disapointed. I have recommended the flick to friends and family, and will enjoy watching it again and again. I am sorry Wisegirls didn't make it to the big screen, but I am sure we will see more of Mariah in the future."
1,This series should have ended with book 1 or 2,This book is not even worth 1 star. I gave it 1 star because the author finished the series and I didn't have to wonder about how it ended. This book was just so terrible and I wished I had not even started this series.
2,Same as above reviewer!,Juniors! Juniors? Now when I ordered these the title said Womens. Now I am stuck with these. Unless you want a junior cut dont order these! ANd they run small. So go one size up. Now I need to lose 40 lbs! to be a junior size again that is!
5,"A very, VERY important book","Author William Brennan takes a much-needed look at the semantics of oppression. He effectively shows that the language used to justify the treatment of Native Americans by the U.S. government, African Americans prior to the end of slavery, and European Jews during World War II is the same language used to speak of the unborn in today's culture.This is an eye-opening book and there can be no denying the author's powerful thesis."
4,A much needed biography,"I read the English edition of this biography a few months ago and enjoyed it. I think that once you have read this book, you really don't need to read another biography of Isherwood.However, I kept thinking as I read this book, that has there ever been a life more recycled for literary purposes than Isherwood?I am a fan of Isherwood and am glad to own this book."
3,Cheap Stuff - But Works!,"The headset HS-23 OEM product is really cheap when compared with Nokia's original HS-23 Stereo Headset, If you are lucky you might get happy with this unit. As all things goes with OEM bare product, there is no documentation available, Just the headset and couple of in-ear foams.Pros:(+) Cheap, Very cheap indeed.(+) Decent Audio quality(+) Can change FM Stations and Volume control using the headset buttons(+) Voice Activated dialing possible(+) Gives my nokia phone FM Radio capabilityCons:(-) As with any cheap product, Construction is so and so.(-) It can easily get tangled up, odd looking contraption.(-) Sometimes FM station scan may not happen (Could be a phone issue)(-) The built-in microphone is not as good as Handset's microphone.The review was done using Nokia 6085 (Black) from AT&T;, Your mileage may vary with other Nokia handsets.By far, this is the cheapest way to get FM radio and Stereo headset capability on Nokia compatible phones"
2,Piece of garbage,"I ordered six ear bud headsets. I tried one and the person I was speaking with couldn't hear me. My husband tried one; he really liked it, but when when he spoke with me I heard buzzing on the line. After a week or two it broke completely."
5,Very good for this price,"I just received the headset two days ago. They provide quite a satisfactory sound quality for listening to music during my walk. The function button for answering phone is also very convenient. Mic is clear enough. I won't bother to look for a better headset, since I already have this one with such a low price."
4,best overall,"I have 3 different sets of wired earbuds made for the nokia and these are the best all around. decent sound, good fit great controls and cheap. If your on a budget and wand the best all around I recommend these. Best feature is the inline volume control, a must in my book."
4,It serves its purpose,"For the amount that you pay for it, It is a good investment. The sound quality is great, you can use it for incoming calls and the person on the other line generally has no problem hearing you.Only complaints would be that the setup of the cords is a bit of a hassle, sometimes you cannot hear the call as good as you can the music, and the earbuds are quite large.Overall its pretty good though."
3,"Good sound, bad design.","The sound quality is top notch, but how on earth can anyone keep these things in their ears? They're huge and don't fit my little ears in the slightest, which makes this a bad buy for me. I'm gonna have to try getting an adapter for regular ear phones. Maybe if you have big ears then these would be great? I don't know, but they aren't for me."
3,Good for the price,"The sound is great for music, but I haven't used it for calls yet. The thing I don't like is the earbuds are too big and don't stay in very well."
1,"sucks, broke in a week","The headset sold by bargaincell was very poor in quality that broke only few days. Now I can only hear but not speak. It was so fragile that if you push the button which should be a volume control(but it's not), the shell break apart and you can see the inside. Terribly made. Absolutely a fake product. Don't buy those anymore!!!"
1,Not the same item it used to be.,"I've owned two of these headsets before purchasing this one, but despite being the same model number the one I just recieved was different. It is made with noticably cheaper plastic, the audio quality is much poorer with music, and worst of all the volume button is no longer a button. It is a piece of plastic that serves no more purpose than filling the spot where the volume button was previously. At times I get a buzzing sound that can be heard in the earpiece, and by those that I am calling. The headset looks identical in pictures, but for some reason Nokia has begun constructing these differently. At least it wasn't expensive."
3,Good buy,"Great price, sound is nice with enough volume, also enables me to change radio stations on my 6085 Really the only drawback is that the mic will rub up against your shirt causing unnecessary noise, shame its not provided with a clip."
2,would not purchase again,"Too much noise cause from microphone rubbing on clothes-cannot adjust to avoid. People on other end cannot hear clearly: sounds muffled, distant or cuts out completely. Must hold microphone to mouth for people to hear better-which defeats ""hands-free"" purpose. I end up disconnecting and just using phone alone."
3,Can't be beaten for the price.,The product arrived quickly and in good condition. The cords were pretty tangled though and no foam covers provided. Worked perfectly with the Nokia 6102i. The sound is good and the controls are easy to work.
3,Good to use only for speaking - Does not have FM control,"This good to use as basic headset. It does not have seek button to control FM and songs. If you missed your original headset, you can go for this. If you use this headset just for speaking to the caller, it is good."
3,used and missing,"The product works perfectly with the Nokia 6086, allowing you to listen to the phone's radio or music player in the standby mode and still receive a call by pushing a button on the pendant ... and pushing it again when the call is over to return to the music. The pendant also has a volume control. Cool.Although the product was priced at about 10% of t-mobile's price, the one I got from this vendor was used, cords were nearly impossibly tangled, and it was delivered without the little foam covers for the earbuds normally provided with the headset. Not cool."
1,Not Compatible with E62,This headset is NOT compatible with the Nokia E62! The Nokia E62 has a 2.5mm headphone jack and not the pop port shown on this accessory.
1,Amazon/Discount Jungle ripped me off,"I purchased this item, it worked for 1 hour and then quit. Would not do anything with the remote or the manual knob. I returned the item for a refund. Discount Jungle is a very shady company, pretty much a scam. They made it sound like they were going to reimburse me for my return shipping charges. When they got it they refused to pay it, and then they only refunded me a portion of the purchase price, said they tested the unit and it works fine then charged me a re-stocking fee. I know the unit did'nt work and Im sure they do the same thing to anybody else that returns something. They scammed me out of over $100. I will be filing a complaint with the BBB. And I will never buy anything else from Amazon if they use shady sellers such as Discount Jungle. One more thing, the number they give you for customer help isnt even a working number."
2,Bad Luck or Bad Production Quality,"I really wanted this project to work for me. It had all the major features I was looking for (especially the line out for hooking to other systems). The sound was great, but after two weeks it shorted or otherwise stopped working (no sound, just clicks). I returned for an exchange with Amazon (which was easier than most store returns) and received the second one pretty quickly. However, that one arrived with a broken volume control. The volume control worked for the first few minutes, but then I suspect as the unit warmed up, it began to set the volume at random levels (high then low, then high again) as the knob was turned. The remote control volume still worked fine.I figured that two tries were enough, especially given the price. Both of my units were in the first 500 shipped (based on serial number), so it might have been an early production problem, or maybe I just didn't have great luck."
5,Great Sound--Great Size,"I am a pro music producer. For years, I have been frustrated. Why?First I get something to sound great in the studio. Then I take it home and it sounds completely different. Then I take my track out to the car. It sounds different again. And NEVER EVER has anything sounded as wonderful as in the recording studio. Until now, that is.I absolutely LOVE my Octavio! EVERYTHING sounds great on it; true and real and wonderful. Every track is just the way we put it together. I am astonished!!!I also like the way it looks; neat and elegant, it makes sense to my eyes. No big, clunky speakers take over my home studio. No tiny little boxes look funny hung way up high. I love the black leather look. The grill covers are nice but I prefer it ""au natural"".Being female, I do care about these things, I must admit. To me, size does matter. And the Octavio is a perfect size. But more importantly, the sound is awesome. I'm a very happy pro."
1,Not Good,"Right out of the box, a speaker was blown and the remote didn't work. If it would have worked, it probably would have been a great speaker."
3,Not worth the price.,"I was disappointed with the Octavio speaker system, especially based on all the other glowing reviews and high price. If what you want is volume with decent bass, you might like it. Surprizingly, I found that my smaller older Bose CD/radio unit had a more refined sound at different volume levels. The Octavio sounded a little boomy. Quality control must be an issue too, because one of the Octavio speaker surrounds was mis-shaped (kind of square in one area, instead of round). Not what you expect for $500."
4,Music to upset your pets,"Even pets know the sound of something going terribly, terribly wrong. Unlike other glitch artists, Oval eschews techno-minimalism to create lush textures from skipping CDs, feedback, and assorted drones. The funny thing about listening to Oval is that, after a while, you'll start to hear music in their ungodly scraping and you won't be able to tell if the music is objectively ""there"" or if it is your brain trying to cope with the trauma.If you're going to buy just one Oval CD, this is the one to get."
3,"If you like it, you like it. If you don't, you don't.","The fact that there are no song titles says a lot about this CD. As I listened to it, I realized that it all sounds pretty much the same, which is to say its a lot of noise with some incredibly nice moments throughout. I like this CD, but its not as good as ""discont"" and its good for one long listening except that it has one of those dumb hidden tracks after 10 minutes of silence (which about ruins any album in my opinion). I suggest checking out the Oval website for some free downloads, which are as good as anything on this record (formandfunction.net/en/artists/oval/oval2.htm)."
2,"Don't Waste Your Money, Better Choices Available","I've owned several digital cameras in the last few years, from a Kodak DC to a Canon Elph, to now, a Kyocera. While the Kyocera is certainly the fastest in terms of turning on and shooting, it lacks in the most important areas: battery life and picture quality. After reading the reviews here, you will see that everyone complains about the battery life. It is in one word, pitiful. I've owned my Kyocera now for 1 year and I'm lucky to get 15 total minutes out of a charged battery. That is down from the 30 min. total that I got out of the battery freshly charged out of the box. That is simply unacceptable. The picture quality is fair, but for the price, I expect better. I would not recommend this product and I advise looking elsewhere. Don't make the mistake of dropping $300 - $400 on this camera only to be dissatisfied and already shopping for a replacement within 1 year."
4,Kyocera Finecam SL400R,"This is the most convenient camera I have ever used. The expanded memory card I bought allows me to take a ton of pictures (over 100). The only problem I ever encountered was the original battery has no life longevity. I am in the market for a new battery. It has been 2.5 years since my purchase, and I guess that batteries don't last forever anyways!!I have had ""Wow""'s every time I pull this camera out of a pocket of my jeans. People are amazed at the size, design, and picture quality. I think with better marketing, this camera could have been HUGE!!!"
2,No Battery life,"I read about the batteries have a low life but just buy an extra battery try 3 or 4 batteries more like it at $60 bucks a pop. You barley get 20 indoor flash pitches with a brand new freshly charge battery. The battery will only get worse over time I think.This dos not work for my style of shooting if you only shoot one roll of film it might work for you, but why pay $300 $400 to only shoots 19-20 shots with a digital camera."
4,Master Locks Rock,"It's a pretty sweet lock. Heavy duty! The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars is that it's heavier than I expected and it can be a bit cumbersome at first. I'm a bike commuter so I use it everyday. Now I actually have a pretty slick system where I can leave it locked to my bike 24/7. When I ride, the lock is latched on my bike's cross-tube and down-tube so it's out of the way. It's super easy when locking my bike -- I just unlatch it from the down-tube and lock it to the bike rack. It's a bit pricey if you don't get it on sale. Mine was 60% of MSR -- worth every penny!"
3,Pretty good.,I purchased these as a light weight alternative to the standard Kry+++++++ type lock which I hear can be picked with pens and easily twisted off. These come with one cylindrical key and seem to be of decent quality. They are definitely bigger than they look in the pics. I did find one weakness which I will not mention for the safety of all bikers but it would not be immediately obvious but it would be a simple break. Over all pretty good for a quick 5 min run in the store but I wouldn't leave my bike unattended for too long with only these to protect. They are pretty light weight which is a nice plus. I'd give a 3.5 but the option is not available.
1,"Unreliable quality, poor customer service","It's a cheap solution, but not a great one.PROS+ Less expensive than Kryptonite locks+ Not often seen, so thieves will be less familiar with itCONS- The actual durability of the lock isn't great. The connection joint would be an easy place to cut through.- The customer service of the company is very poor. I've spent the last month trying to get the warranty information they require filed (which is requested via registered mail with no electronic option). Their mailing address has changed recently and they haven't elected for mail forwarding at their old address, so be careful if you go down this route. As of today, I still haven't been able to get the warranty filed with them. As they state their guarantee's only for people who have gone through the process, this is a concern. Can anyone respond to whether MasterLock has paid out this warranty historically?- The turning mechanism jams very easily."
4,Master's 9 link Street Cuffs,"Love these cuffs, I get lots of questions about where I got them when people see me use them. These cuffs are not just made for looks they are high quality and very sturdy!"
5,By far the best bike locks I have ever had!,I have not had a single problem with these locks. Their uniqueness is a great theft deterrent in and of itself. The only problem is that everyone likes to stop you to ask where you got them.
1,Junk,"These failed me completely! In the first few days I went to unlock them and the one cuff on the frame would not unlock with either key. So....I had to go to a locksmith. After opening it we reattached the cuffs to the bike and the other side ""froze"" but this time after trying to pick it....no luck, so it had to be cut. After many phone calls to Masterlock, I was finally able to get a refund but it was a hassle!"
5,lock,This is an excellent buy. We needed something to lock our generator. This is the product. No way can they cut this. I was skeptical until I saw it. Great buy and a great invention.
3,MASTER LOCK,"there should be more links, it is too short with 9 links. The information should include the length, in inches, of the links."
1,lock is a joke!,"Had this lock on my bike, forgot it was there, drove off with it on and it broke. No damage to my bike, this would not stop anything."
3,"Japanese design, American Culture","I first saw these style locks in Japan, which is where Master Lock got the idea from for mass distribution in the US, I assume. However, in agressive bike-theft areas in California and New York, for example.. these locks are not going to stand up to theft methodology. I'm going to get one but it's only protecting a 60$ investment.Cute, but I think more for a town where you don't want someone to walk away with your bike verses trying to protect against determined criminals.good luck, safe biking!-erica"
3,"Like the lock, but the chain is NOT 22 inches!","The lock itself works great! The only complaint I have is that the chain does not span 22 inches. They are counting from the top of one cuff to the top of the other, which is rather irritating! So, if you need your chain to span over 20 inches like I do, you might want to look at purchasing a different product."
4,"Sturdy lock, easy to use.",I bought this lock for my Ducati Monster 769. The swivel feature on the cuffs makes it quite simple to use and it is very visible so that in itself would be a deterrent. I attach it from one of the front tire spokes to the fork and with the plastic sheaths on the cuffs it does not damage the bike. It is heavy but I can easily transport it in the backpack I use and do not even feel the weight when I ride. The only negative I can say is that when I sent the paperwork in to the company to register the product it came back as undeliverable even though the address was correct. Not sure why this happened.
1,Check it out before buying,"I've had this book for sometime (bought based on the first recommendation here ...), but found it hard to characterize this book: the humor seems to gear towards the young adolescent reader, the content--simple, simple instructions on table manners--seems to aim at the 2 or 3 year olds, the art work in the book (and the odd inclusion of photographs of headshots) seems to beg for appreciation from an adult reader (and it is not my cup of tea). I suggest that before you shell out ... look through the sample pages here to make sure that this is for you."
2,Too Simple and Too Advanced,"This book on table manners has charming art and dryly funny text -- for an adult. The manners taught in it are way, way too simple for anyone but a 2 year old (eat with a spoon--not your hands, wipe on the napkin--not your sleeve, Don't put food in your hair), while the pictures and text are far too advanced for a two year old. A Ten year old might be tickled by the elaborate Russian names, but a child young enough for those lessons can barely talk yet. I bought Tiffany's Table Manners instead, and while it describes too many advanced manners for young children, it has a sufficiency of the ones they need, with plenty more to grow into."
1,Defeats its purpose,"I can understand wanting to make the subject of manners funny in order to get children interested, but this book is more likely to cause bad manners than good. One does not say ""Good Lord"" to be polite and yet its the voice of the ""teacher"" in the book saying this (I can just imagine my 4 year old running around the house saying it just because he'll think its funny, not going to happen, this book goes back to the library). Many of the lists of what not to do will become ideas of what to do for naughty little ones and while that IS funny, it doesn't help with manners.Also, each page is so chaotic I couldn't bring myself to completely look at the book. There may be something good in there, but I'm repelled. But I did look at it long enough to know that if you are looking for a book that is more fun and naughtiness than good manners, this is it."
1,sucked,this movie sucked dont waste your money. this isnt even a production movie just a bunch of vhs quilty and grainy footage of crap.
2,Not a Good Buy,"Don't get this disc is you already have Dude Ranch. The 3rd song is OK, but even that can be found on other things. It's just not worth an import price.For true Blink nuts only."
2,Not a great choice.,"There are better choices for learning about MBAs by distance learning than this book. One is Bears' Guide to the Best MBAs by Distance Learning. I bought both books and it's not even close. This is particularly true if cost is important. Bears' book provides many more international MBAs (UK, Australia, Canada) which are far cheaper than almost all of the U.S. programs, but are still academically quite strong (and better than many of the U.S. programs).It is now well-known that Peterson's sells ad space in their books disguised as research. Shame on them! Obviously these schools are allowed to say whatever they want."
5,History in retrospect,Excellent review of americanism in historical retrospect via films of when America believed in itself.
4,Definitely worth it...,"You must think a complete collection of any artists' music videos would be way more expensive, then figure in the fact that you are getting 4 groups in one. This is probably the best way to support a fan...by not ripping them off left and right. Good product, great price. Only drawback I can see is that it isn't HD quality. Definitely worth buying though."
5,RIVETING AND INFORMATIVE,I just finished reading this book. This is not only for Jewish people but other religions as well. It's a part of our history and I found it very enjoyable and informative. A must read.
5,Palmers shampoo,"Love the way my hair feels after washing with this shampoo. Wish it had a nice scent. Smell is pleasant, but would like a scent that smells more like coconut."
3,Not great,I've used better products before. It doesn't work any better than a dollar store product. I now stick to Nexus.
1,no response,This seller does not respondThe item did not arrive on time in fact did not arrive at allThere is no reason to do business with this person
4,"A ""Must"" For Fans!!!","This dvd is surely a must for fans for any of the musicians who contributed on this dvd. It's by the way my first footage of Gov't Mule for which I'm very pleased. Being a fan of Warren and Allen since there ABB time I knew I had to have this dvd.A couple of other people were right, there is a bit to much Mike Gordon on my t.v. screen, but what the heck it's all for Allen Woody. So my conclusion is that this is a wonderfull documentary."
2,don't put your dumb self in the movie,There is way too much footage of the filmmaker in this documentary. precious time is wasted listening to him ramble on and on. Hardly any footage of allen woody. I wouldn't recomend unless your a hardcore fan.
2,high expectations ---> disappointment,"Far too much of Mr. Gordon's narration, analysis and ""vision"".Not nearly enough footage of the actual guests sitting in with Warren and Matt.And why no full takes of the tunes?!?!?!?I'll stick to the cds, thank you very much . . . ."
3,A Bass Player's Delight!,"I'm a bass player, age 47, and I found ""Rising Low"" to be both interesting and entertaining. It was great to see all the bass players that have influenced me over the years, namely, Entwhistle, Jack Bruce, Larry Graham, Bootsy Collins, Jack Cassady, Phil Lesh and Willie Weeks. I agree with some of the other reviewers regarding Mike Gordon (too much of his musings on the meaning of bass). But it was great to hear these guys talk about how they get into the groove and how it takes them into another space completely. I would also agree that it would have been nice to have complete songs on this DVD ... there weren't any complete tunes, just snippets of songs that the various players played on.If you're a musician, I recommend this DVD ... it's fun! If you're not a musician, I'm not sure whether you'll find it as entertaining as I did."
3,NOT ENOUGH MUSIC!,"If you purchase this DVD expecting to see a documentary regarding the life of bassist, Allen Woody, then this well-done DVD is for you. However, if you are looking for a ""music"" DVD, you will be disappointed. There are only sporatic performances, and no complete songs. The documentary was interesting from the standpoint of Woody's contribution to Gov't Mule, and the guest bassists' contribution to the project, but simply not enough complete performances to make me want to watch this over again."
4,Good Deal!,I am very happy with this kit. I have been using it for two weeks now and I have been very satisfied. Also - it did come with the ball strap. Based on an older review I thought I would need to get a strap separately but it was included with my set.
1,Don't waste your money.,"I did not receive everything in my kit. The parts to inflate the ball were cheap plastic that did not fit. I took the ball into a sporting goods store, and the employee agreed with me. The ball could not be inflated with what I received. Please save your money."
1,absolutely poor,I was very dissappointed in this selection. Maybe it was my own fualt but I expected more. There is no action. Just scene after scene of stripping. No inter-action between anyone...any one got any sugestions for a real erotic or pornographic movie?
1,the very dissapointment,This could hurt Jenna Jameson image from doing something this lame like this video. I mean she did other video's that were softcore but they had more action then this video. Her image could really get hurt when theirs just only girl on girl action no men.
3,Fertilaid For Women,"I have been using this supplement for the past 7-8 months. 3 Months later, I decided to start on theFertileCM: for Fertile Cervical Mucusto improve my CM. My husband is onFertilAid for Men: Male Fertility Supplement - 3 Month Supplyfor the past 4 months.We have been ttc for about a year plus and I believe that taking the supplements would increase our chances. I have been on the pill for almost 9 years and I guess perhaps it does take a while for my body to recover for it to be fertile. I asked my gynae if being on the pill this long will delay my ttc chances... she said it shouldn't matter and I could get pregnant in a couple of months. I read though in books that what the pill actualls does is to make your cervical mucus hostile to sperm and the endometrium too thin for implantation.My husband and I are still consuming the respective FertilAid products in hope that maybe we'll be lucky one day with our very own bundle of joy!Will update if there are any changes!"
3,Still Waiting,"Got this product november 12th, began taking it November 13th, my af came Nov1st thru 6th, and began spotting after taking fertilaid Nov 23rd and havent stopped yet. I took the product religiously three tablets a day and am still awaiting m BFP, or at least a regular cycle. my DH is overseas working so we dont get to BD much, but i gave it three stars because it did something. read somewhere that im spotting because my body is still getting use to the product so....we'll see."
3,Not Sure if that's a good sign.,Got package on time compared to last time when I had to get a refund.I don't know what's going on but my period is extremely late-I have not seen it for the month at all. I know I'm not pregnant because the person who's going to help me conceive is not even around{LDR}. I'm supposed to be using this in preparation for when we will meet.
2,NOT a miracle-worker,"IF you are getting this product to hopefully become pregnant, think again! I didn't read too many reviews that said they became pregnant while using this. Many of the reviewers said that Fertil-Aid regulated their periods after a few weeks or even months. Think about this: How can a period be regulated in a few weeks? Also, It takes a few months for a period to be normally restored anyway. The product is nothing but a prenatal vitamin with vitex added in. I wish I knew this before I bought it, but it clearly states this on the back of the bottle. You must take it 3 times a day everyday as you would a normal vitamin. Why not buy a regualar pre-natal vitamin over the counter? It is really not as great as the add makes it to be. I used it and then went to regular OTC vitamins."
2,Not quite what I hoped for,"First let me say that this video is fun to watch. The author knows his stuff. My only issue is that I thought it would be more instructional. I am NOT an experienced guitar player, and I hoped for more slow motion and basics. If you are inexperienced, I don't think this is for you, but you will pickup some pointers that I have not seen anywhere else."
3,Okay,"I wish it was more practical with better scenarios to guide architects through schema and business object definitions, gotchas and more. It gives areas to think about such as Project Managers roles, this is valuable. It could be better if updated... for example how do some of the new frameworks for persistence or distributed transactions fit?"
4,Back to basics for U2,"The title says it all that U2 is back to the kind of music their known for, great guitar work by The Edge and soaring vocals from Bono this song reminds me that U2 isn't going to leave the music scene. This DVD includes the music video to ""Electrical Storm"" the video is not very different from previous because U2 has always been creative with their videos using very creative directors such as one of my favs ""One"" a must see if you like U2 all in all this DVD is a nice dolby 5.1 version or you could get the ""Best Of U2 1990 - 2000"" which includes many other U2 videos including this one."
3,Great for Most kids....not all,"I'm so glad we listened to a sample of this before purchasing. It is a sweet CD, but the speaker's language is too silly for my older daughter's taste. My daughter is almost 5, and when she has an exciting day, it is hard for her to wind down. The speaker's voice is already a little too high pitched to have a calming effect on her, and the use of childish words (such as ""piggies"" instead of toes), just made my daughter get silly and wild. I think this CD would be great for my younger daughter, but since they share a room I can't use it. I bought the ""Guided Meditation for Children"" and the ""Positive Thoughts for Children"" by Chitra Sukhu. So far, so good.... This really is a nice CD if it fits your child's personality. Just make sure before you purchase it."
1,My son became terrified,My son became terrified after listening to this cd. I am not sure if the chimes in the background were new sounds. Days later he is still affected--crying a lot and saying he never wants to do meditation again. I am sad that I exposed him to it.
1,My son became terrified,"My 4 year old son became terrified while listening to this CD. He has done meditation daily using the Indigo Dreams series and never had this reaction. I am not sure why, but maybe the chimes used in the background were foreign to him. He is a very happy, joy- filled child, but has been crying so much over the last two days after listening to this. He says it is the meditation that has given him bad dreams. Anyways, I hope other children aren't affected the way mine was. I really regret exposing him to it."
5,Stars Across America,"This was a great accessory to the videos and programs on television.You can return and reference the designs and the information may clarify something that was seen on television. I especially like the information she gave on yardage for various sizes of quilts (baby quilts, lap quilts, etc.). I love her shows and now I love her books."
5,Great Reference,this book is a must for quilters interested in history. It's a history and quilting lesson all in one! I have seen her half hour shows on T.V. also and it's great to follow along and even make notes for future useSandie Gano
5,Stars,I have already made the Stars Across America quilt top and found the instructions precise and easy to follow. The little stories about the women the stars were dedicated to were very interesting. Loved the book
3,Gritty Reading,This was the first title by Urrea I read. Not his best work and I wouldn't recommend it to others for their first read either. The Devil's Highway is a better place to start.
1,snooze......,This is ridicously boring!! I do not recommend it to anyone. I dont enjoy this type of writing and wasnt thrilled to read it for college.
5,attorney X,"Excellent sellere; excellent price. First editions of this book are going for nearly $500 and this reprint was very reasonably priced. The book itself is an excellent view of Georgia in the first half of the 19th Century, written by one of Georgia's governors....incidentally, he was the man who marked off the first road from the frontier to the Chattahoochee River, naming it the Ft. Peachtree Road...later to become the famous Peachtree Road."
1,This is not a biography of Paul Klipsch,"This is one of the worst biographies I have ever read. In fact is it not a biography of Paul Klipsch at all. It is a tribute to him by his second wife, ghost written by the authors. Paul's life before his second wife hardly exists. We learn almost nothing of his life with his first wife. Worse, the technical aspects of Paul's life are almost ignored. Paul W. Klipsch was a great engineer, an entrepreneur, and a great man for what he did with his money (an Engineering school is named after him for his extensive support). But what made all this possible were the technical innovations which he brought to the audio industry, and these nontechnical authors don't have a clue what that is all about. So this is not a biography of Paul W. Klipsch. A better title would be ""My Life with Paul W. Klipsch"" by his Second Wife."
1,Only a fraction of the story as told by PWK wannabes,"The authors of this poorly written biography may have met the man in his twilight years and obviously garnered their information from very limited resources. Therfore only a mere part of the real story has been told and indeed a biased one at that. P. Wilbur, as his closest associates knew him, was robbed of his legacy by a bunch of wannabes and they told their side of the story which is now in print for their own benefit. I gave it one star for the fact that it does document some of his achievements."
1,Childishly Written,"This is the clumsiest, most poorly written hardcover I have ever read. The last chapter, amazingly worst than the others, is totally incoherent. I have no idea how this could have gotten published. From what I know of Paul Klipsch and his personality, having only spent one evening with him, I believe he would find this book an utter embarrassment,That said, if you're interested in some tidbits about the life of Paul Klipsch there are a lot of them here. But be forewarned, it reads exactly like sorting through a shoebox full of miscellaneous notes and scraps of paper."
3,Paul W klipsch the legend,"Over all I found this book to be very enjoyable and a bit difficult to follow as it jumps around with no real structure. I would recommend this to the Klipsch speaker enthusiasts who want to place this on their coffee table. I would give this 3 stars out of 5. I'm still searching for ultimate Klipsch book that covers timelines, facts, pictures, and speaker articles and a lot less fluff."
5,Great,"Kim Lucas has a really nice voice that reminds me of such artists as Sarina Paris, and Ann Lee. I first got introduced to her with her song with Eiffel 65 called All I really want, and this is even better. Buy it, you'll be surprised."
5,Two OUTSTANDING novels in one book,"I like both of these authors, but two in one book was more than I could ever ask for! I laughed and cried my way through both stories and was so, so, so, so, very much impressed with how the ethics of the Wiccan religion played a part in the heroines' lives. These books have everything I like: wicca, romance, mystery, and paranormal elements. I can't wait for sequels!"
3,"Witchy, but still...","To have books about witches that aren't stereotypical in our ugly evilness and, very occasionally, our perfection, is good. Interesting story, Witch Moon Rising. The bodice grabber, Witch Moon Waning was written really poorly. Read and discarded both quickly, while really good books featuring the Craft are cherished and re-read. None of the characters haunt me nor stayed with me after the book was closed. Can't say they're as bad as most portrayals, but there's still a long way to go to rival books like ""Mists of Avalon"", both beautifully written, and Craft-savvy as it is. Maybe Witch Moon Rising would be a good book for a pre-teen crafter. Maybe. Worth one brief read, and that's about all. We have a long way to go in Wiccan fiction."
2,moves along slowly,different sex scene where he goes under her dress for some action!Acting in general could have been better!movie is ok
2,Another Blu-ray that isn't what it should be...,"Let me start by saying that I thought the movie was okay. If this review were based on the movie alone, I would give it 3 or 4 stars. Unfortunately for movie studios, that isn't how reviews are done anymore. There is no reason why this release on Blu-ray shouldn't include every version of the movie that has been released until now. It seems like just one more future double-dip release waiting to happen... Why, why would they not include both versions? That way those who like the R or UR would both be happy! It certainly wouldn't stop anyone from purchasing this movie, while the choice they made to only include the theatrical release has had the opposite effect. I won't be buying this movie, and from the other reviews it sounds like I'm not the only person with who has made this choice."
5,Great Shoes!,These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned. The leather is soft and pliable. Buy these shoes!
2,OK but not too excited about it,These shoes are atleast half or a full size bigger than the size that is listed. This creates a big problem specially when you are buying something online and also when you cannot return easily to a store nearby. Amazon charges return shipping charges if you say that you bought a bigger size when it is really their problem that the size is not in conformance with the universal size standard. Shoes are OK but look a lot cherryish than it looks on the website.
2,cheap looking soles,"nice leather shoes. the 2*'s is for the cheapness of the foam used for the bottom of the shoe (heel and anything else that's not leather)... quality shoes use something glossy, plastic, vinyl, something... foam is simply cheap looking."
5,A gem!,"I got this book as a gift. Comparing to some other art history books that are heavy, bulky with information that are more valuable to historians, this book is a real gem for the following reasons:1. Its size is very manageable: 8.5in long x 7.5in wide x 1&1/8in deep. It is very easy to flip through the pages on your lap, in your hands or on a table;2. Other than some major works that cover both pages, most of the pages contain 2-4 paintings. This is very valuable to a working artist like me, as these small sized paintings are great for compositional and color ideas.3. High printing quality.4. Because of its manageable size and being not overloaded with information, I was able to finish the book front to end and gain a quick understanding about art history. With this jump start, it is easier to deepen one's knowledge by reading books on specific art styles or individual artists that defined the history.In short, I am grateful that I got this book and I use it often."
3,A valuable source -- but...,"Obviously, as a primary source, this is valuable material, but I have to admit that I found it rather dull. Naturally it isn't fair to judge someone's personal letters on their literary quality, but I wish Goree had seen fit to describe his tasks as an aide, battles (Gettysburg, to my recollection, never appears here), or, well, anything. He focuses primarily on how all his various relatives are doing and so on. At the end of the book letters between him, General Longstreet, and other aides have been appended which will interest those studying the various controversies which have surrounded Longstreet. I really can't see how the non-specialist will enjoy this."
1,Weak rehash of the manual,"As an Illustrator newbie, I was looking for some examples of ""real world"" projects with ideas on how to approach them using this incredibly powerful but incredibly complex piece of software. But there's precious little ""real world"" here, unless you consider pathetic attempts at humor to be ""real world."" You'd think that a book about a high-end illustration program that purported to be ""real world"" would at least have examples that a ""real world"" graphic artists might produce for a ""real world"" client, perhaps simplified somewhat to make a point. But instead, what you get are simplistic, off-the-cuff drawings that do a poorer job of explaining things than the simple examples in the Illustrator manual.There's not much here that's not in the user's manual. Don't waste your money."
1,Hard to digest,"Easy to read, but I'm still wondering what, if anything, I got out of this book. The guy can write, maybe he should do op-ed pieces instead of technical computer software guides."
2,irritating and often wrong,"Mr.McClelland's writing style is childish and irritating. If you cut out the lame attempts at humor, the book would be half its current length. Get to the point, Deke. People want clear answers to their software questions, not your unfunny jokes and inaccuracies. The author has been taken to task for these problems elsewhere in print (Professional Photoshop). I just don't understand how he gets to keep writing these books. Just a familiar name, I guess. The section on color management in this book is terrible. It is skimpy (shows the author doesn't really know what he's talking about). And worse, there are serious factual errors about Illustrator's use of profiles and policies. If you really want to learn Illustrator, skip this book and buy the Visual Quickstart Guide instead. It is far superior."
4,EXCELENT MUSICAL EXPERIENCE,"Not being a big fan of The Beatles, but it's a very enjoyable listening experience. There is an abundance of new instruments and more armonies than usual on this work. this is a great CD."
2,An Insult to the Beatles,"I never could imagine that someone would make the music of the Beatles sound so cheap and primitive, and then will publish the result as a ""tribute"". All arrangements are very uninventive and lacking of drive which has been present in abundance on much earlies albums of Rick Wakeman."
3,When is a warranty NOT a warranty?,"Let's see - they're red, they're plastic, each spoon is marked with its size ... they can be used to measure liquids and/or solids ... they're small, and so easily-stored.Cuisinart's 5-year limited warranty is ... well, you decide. Keep in mind that this 5-piece set of measuring spoons sells for $3.99. The warranty says that if, during the first five years, any of the spoons should prove to have a manufacturing defect, you can mail it, prepaid, along with a check for $5.00 to Cuisinart, and if they agree that there was a defect they will send you a replacement spoon. NOTE THAT IF EACH OF THE SPOONS develops a defect, you would have to send a check for $25.00! Wow! I'm absolutely overwhelmed by Cuisinart's faith in this Chinese-made product."
2,Sweet Bird Of Youth,"Sorry, my husband and I just couldn't get into this movie. I am from the south and of the right generation to appreciate it. However, I did not. Being from the south I recognize the Tennessee Williams theme as it was intended, but found this corney and felt the actors tried too hard. The attempt to speak the southern drawl was greatly overstated. Elizabeth Taylor is a movie legend and Mark Harmon is one of my favorites, but I just could not get into this film. I actually had to make myself watch it to the end. Recognizing Tennesse Williams work for it's greatness and Ms. Taylor's remarkable talent I still can't justify rating it any higher."
2,Sweet Bird of Youth,"Boring, not worth the watching of it. Very disappointed, as I am a big Elizabeth Taylor fan. Cd disc came to me in good condition."
3,A Tough Act To Follow,"Paul Newman and Geraldine Page are memories impossible to erase, so I came to this movie with all the prejudice you can imagine. But I was pleasantly surprised. It's by far Elizabeth Taylor's greatest performance in over 20 years, and Mark Harmon is much better in this than you'd imagine possible. All in all, it's a much more explicit version of Tennessee William's work, and perhaps more accurate into the bargain. Some chemistry is lacking, the supporting cast only go through the motions, but still - kudos to Taylor & Harmon!"
3,If you can't get enough of Leroy Jethro Gibbs,Elizabeth Taylor as an over-the-hill actress (what casting!!) and a totally nude Mark Harmon. Who could ask for more?
5,finally the truth!,"""The truth"" is long overdue... I am a massage practitioner in Seattle and people having a massage tend to say what is on their minds. I often hear comments like ""my manager didn't talk to me for a year"" or ""I think my manager is mad at me for something I did (when in fact she just spent an hour at the car repair shop). If only she would just tell me I did a good job"".Or comments like this -""My assistant doesn't seem to work hard enough and she is starting to make mistakes that effect my work. I don't think I am doing anything wrong"".Even if you are not in management, there is a lot to learn from Steve's hard work in ""The truth...""The book is an easy read, with many examples. It presents common sense answers to everyday problems and issues. Please read it so my clients can rest during their sessions rather than worry."
4,Good primer on managing,"This book provides some basic information on how to manage and interact overall with people in the work place. It has helpful refresher information on group dynamics and motivation. The book is organized in 63 numbered ""truths"" that I thought were interesting and insightful. Each ""truth"" was about a page or two, so there wasn't as much detailed info on how to handle all of the situations discussed."
1,"Why is there ""no stars""?","This book offers absolutely NOTHING NEW about how best to deal with people. You can get much more from an article in Workforce magazine or even Fast Company. Hire the best people you can afford and then let them be who you hired them to be. If you want some good advice about dealing with employees, check out ""Love 'Em or Lose 'Em,"" a classic."
3,It works ...,"The NPN and Bosch cabin filters are superior (in my opinion). The material in the Beck-Arnley filter is very thin, not substantial. Positives are that it is charcoal impregnated, fit well, and it works."
5,this is great,"i got this CD about a month ago and i cant get it out of my head. everything is so tight and together, and its a type of music ive never really heard anywhere else before. this was definately a great purchase and i encourage anyone to try it out. 5 stars in my opinion."
4,4 stars for bad quality,"Every week, my son and I have ""bad movie"" night, and this particular night was spent watching, ""War Of The Planets."" It is unknown to me what the other reviewers were expecting when they bought and viewed this Italian ""epic"" but with the general tone of disappointment, I'd say they expected waaaay too much.We sat there for the 90 minutes enjoying one of the worst movies ever made. Furthermore, we EXPECTED it to be bad and not the second coming of 2001: A Space Odyssey! Probably the funniest thing about this so-called movie is the fact that the makers of this film probably thought they had a hit on their hands, since it came out around the same time as Star Wars. Well, obviously this flick is terrible to the point of being rediculous and, not surprisingly ended up being a dud.My adviced to you is simple: for one night, go ahead and pretend you're dumb, put in this dvd, and enjoy some of the best bad film making ever to hit no one's screen!"
1,"An embarrassment, even for Italian sci-fi","WAR OF THE PLANETS (1977) John Richardson, Yanti Sommer, West Buchanan, Ely King. In this film by Alfonso Brescia (as ""Al Bradley""), astronauts land on an alien planet and agree to help its humanoid inhabitants battle a super-computer that has taken over the planet. Even by 1977 standards, the sets, costumes and special effects look badly dated, the dialogue is often incomprehensible and the performances are uniformly languid. The theme of the film--that man shouldn't become too heavily dependent on machines--simply gets lost in the muck. The Italians were never that good at sci-fi to begin with, but this movie is truly an embarrassment.One star out of five."
4,GRACIAS DIEGO,"El Libro tiene cosas muy interesantes acerca de su niñez, y tiene buenas fotos especialmente en sus inicios en villa fiorito, que nos hacen sentir identificados con un pibe que surge de la nada para convertirse en el mejor. El libro simplemente refleja que aun no ha asimilado lo que le paso, fue tan grande su calidad que no supo afrontarla, no supo y no tuvo alguien para guiarlo, hay que entender que comenzo a los 15 años y practicamente dejo de ser un niño para convertirse en estrella. Yo creo que existe una gran moraleja en su vida, la cual me queda mas clara al terminar de leer este libro, y es que ni la fama,ni el dinero ni el triunfo te van a llevar a ser feliz, su grandesa con el balon fue un regalo que mas que beneficiarle, lo daño, solo espero que encuentre la felicidad y la paz que perdio a los 15 años. Quiero darle gracias por su futbol que nunca olvidare, siempre sera mi idolo y el mejor de la historia"
2,"Diego, you need to get off the clouds...","(Spanish) Diego es un simbolo del narcisismo en el mundo entero. En este libro he encontrado ciertas declaraciones que hacen del Diego una persona que necesita ayuda psicologica, emocional, y espiritual.Diego, definitely, you need Jesus Christ, the Son of God!"
2,Dont buy this?,"i bought this item as a cheap alternative to buying a 5th 360 controller, just so they all wouldnt be white. it came package with the tools necessary to take apart the controller. thats about the only plus. there were just pictures for instructions. just remember if you buy this the 7th screw is in the battery compatrment behind the sticker(took me a few minutes to figure that out. as for the build quality, its solid, but the probem is none of the holes are threaded. also on mine, the d-pad just doesnt want to sit right and seems to have too much play. bottom line is spend your money eslewhere."
4,needs improvement,"I prefer the lid to open automatically & the can to slide out by itself so I wouldn't have to touch the can (normally I have a baby in one hand). Also, I'd prefer it in black (stains won't be as noticeable). However, my handy manny (hubby) promised to put the can at an angle so as soon as I open the cabinet it'll slide out (we have child lock magnets installed so our cabinets should stay shut while closed) and attach the lid to a chain (or something else) and to the cabinet so the lid would open automatically when the can slides out. We'll see how that goes...Update: My husband did install it at a slight angle. It does slide out on it's own when full but not when empty. He never attempted the chain because the cabinets are not tall enough. We'll have to come up with a different solution, but for now we use it as is."
4,An Exciting Tale,"I happened to meet the author (James Lee) at a Barnes and Noble. He was a real nice guy and I thought I'd buy something. This book looked the most interesting. And interesting it was! I read it in about 4 days. It was quite a page turner. I was so intrigued by the book and the events that I immediately went and got a copy of ""The Great Escape"" which is mentioned in this book. And that was fantastic. Now I'm onto yet another WW2 book. I'm really glad I came across this as it has really piqued my interest in WW2 events.I also bought a copy for my dad and grandpa and they enjoyed it too."
5,Happy with this,These are a little shallow but wide and perfect for what I was looking for. If you are looking for a deep heart pan this would not work. Very happy with product!
3,The end of an era,"This book concludes the thongor cycle of Lin Carter. After defeating the magicians and the evil gods into the 2 precedent books (T.in the city of magicians,T.versus the gods) our hero must face his last battle from wich he will exit as the final winner. The end of this book remind the end of the Stormbringer saga"
4,Good cover,This is a good grill cover. Heavy duty material and should last. The only problem I've had with this cover is the cord at the bottom is difficult to pull tight and close properly.
3,grill cover,The color of this cover is actualy a bright kelly green and reverses to a striped kelly green and white. It is made of plastic and pretty flimsy. You get what you pay for.

4,Great...but assumes a bit of knowledge,"You'll need some prior scripting experience to make full use of this book. I don't consider myself a true programmer (to me it's a necessary evil to drive my graphics), and I feel that without my prior understanding of at least a simple object-based language such as Lingo, I may have been lost. It would have been difficult to make the theoretical associations that the author only briefly touches on with few examples. It also assumes prior HTML knowledge. That said, if you have any idea how to speak to a computer already, this book packs Javascript into a tasty bite-sized morsel that won't give you a hernia from carrying it around!Now I must order this book so I can return my partner's copy."
1,TERRIBLE... don't buy it.,Wish I had read other reviews before buying. This book is no tutorial and certainly not a reference. Not very well written or organized. The examples are wrong... AVOID IT!
2,Disapointing (e.g. Flow Control was covered in 4 pages),"I've used the ""instant"" series in the past, and I thought that it was pretty good. However, this book was not very helpful. Case and point: Flow control was covered in 4 pages! Ouch! It was bland, it didn't have enough examples to cary you through. It didn't do good use of it's space. Let me put it this way, out of the 10 chapters, I could say that it had 3 OK chapters, and 7 that I didn't care much about, and I'm a webdeveloper. The 3 chapters that were OK, could've been much better. I'm not quite sure who was the targeted audience, I thought the book made JavaScript more complicated than it really is. I felt that the author wrote down all the concepts in an outline, and then wrote down what he thought was important about each subject, hence no flow."
2,Misleading.,"This book claims to be a tutorial on Javascript for people with knowledge of HTML, but its really more of a referance work. Nothing is explained in detail, the code examples consist of very small fragments that don't fully illustrate the ideas being explained, and basic concepts are overlooked. For instance, the book gives examples of a variety of functions, but never explains or gives an example of how you call them within your HTML code. This is one of the trickier aspects of javascript and its not addressed at all!Very disappointing. Only an experienced Javascript programmer will be able to get much out of it, and only then as a refresher."
2,Too many things at a time..,"I got hold of this book to start learning javascript. I have 5+ yrs of C++, and I was dissapointed with the presentation of this book. The book tries to teach too many things at a time, is poorly organised, and difficult to follow for a first timer. I would recommend step by step approach, which online tutorials much of the time do. Another book ""ABC of Javascript"" was more organised."
1,Usually impressive Wrox strikes out this time!,"Poorly organized, barely accessable. Too bad. Wrox books are usually great. This book needs a complete rewrite. I'm suprised they let this one slide by."
4,Very simple and effective,"They practice what they preach - visit the web site. I found the book likable, very easy to handle and understand, meaningful examples and well organized. So where is the minus? Well, I guess the main problem is abundance of Javascript usage thus the book falls short in including many often used scripts - I would advise authors to expand the book. CD is also needed to simplify implementation, though I successfuly downloaded the files from the web site of the book. Good work."
2,Right Brained?,"I'm no computer programmer, but I can crank out some pretty nifty web pages. But, I needed script's to fully use the web. Bought this book, big mistake!! The author doesn't cater to the non-programer. And, IT'S NOT INSTANT!! It's much to technical to fast, with little practical application. I wish I would have picked up the other book now. I just wasted a lot of money.. :("
2,Incoherent,"I bought this book because I wanted to learn JavaScript. Bad move. For an experienced programmer but new at JavaScript, I needed an organized book and had to look elsewhere. This book is incoherent and unorganized. I only realized this when I picked up another book on JavaScript and started to read it and I couldn't put it down since I could actually understand it. Think twice about buying this book."
2,The Support Files are Poor and Incomplete,"While the book itself is well written, there are many examples that are not included in the download computer support files from WROX. Before anyone buys this book, they should go download the free source code from the wrox website. You will notice something is wrong right away, the file is only 28k Large. Very, Very inadequate. Wrox should update these files by inclucing the omitted examples and expanding the samples even at this point. While I have consistently preferred to buy WROX material, I will now be on guard!"
2,Lacking,"While this dictionary covers many Irish words, I most dislike it because it has NO pronunciations. It gives you all these wonderful Irish words, but no way to know how they're pronounced, unless you have a hefty grip on Irish pronunciations already. It is not a dictionary for beginners."
5,Collins Gem Irish Dictionary (Collins Gem,THIS IS A GOOD ADDITION TO OUR LIBRARY WITH OTHER LANGUAGES.WE WILL USE IT OFTEN AS WE TRY TO LEARN A NEW LANGUAGE.
2,An adequate dictionary if you only want to WRITE the word.,This is an average dictionary. It has lots of words but is virtually USELESS if you intend on speaking Gaelic as it has NO PRONUNCIATIONS FOR ANY WORDS.Do not buy this book if you are attempting to speak Gaelic. You will be thoroughly disappointed. If however you only want to look up Gaelic words and find out what they mean then it will do the job for you.
3,Okay,This was an okay movie but it was unrealistic how everyone was getting away with murder but getting caught for petti crimes and drug crimes and they always had people in jail one minuet and out the next and back in the next and they never told how they got in there or when hey got in there
5,Helps you really USE the book,"This helps you get the most out of a great book. I love Dr. Phil. If you have a family in a less than stellar situation, GET THIS BOOK. It will help if you really apply what it says and are steadfast. There are no quick fixes here. There are tools to guide you and you have to do the hard work, but it's worth it."
3,Bitter Encore by Helen Bianchin,"This was a good read, believable characters and situations.From back cover:Four years ago Rachel had been thrust into the half-light of her famous husband's career and she had found the pressures too much to bear. But now they were reunited and it wal all going to be very different. Or was it? There was the endless round of false publicity, the contant scrutiny of the public eye, the parasites and the feeling that she and Laz were never alone together. Nothing had changed and Rachel was just as ill-equipped to cope as she had always been."

5,"An astounding life, well told ...","This is an extraordinary book. It is the first one I have found, written by an Afghan person, telling of life there. Her life is important to be told, and she does it extremely well. I had no idea what suffering our fellow humans endure on the other side of the world - or sky, as Farah sweetly viewed it as a little girl! Also, I had no idea how hideous it can be for immigrants coming here, even though the experience is viewed as a great blessing. Farah has more wisdom as a teenager, than most of our citizens have at any age; and shares her life openly and honestly. She has amazing faith in God, which was a surprise to me. Ah, I am so ignorant... that's why I want to learn. This is a book everyone should read. I deeply admire you, Farah, for giving our country this gift!"
5,"Land Mines, Children, and the Horror of War","This book's moving first person story helps us to see the horror behind the reality of land mines and why we should care so deeply about doing something about clearing them and stopping their use. It gives a face to war, and a young person's innocent yet brave perspective. I think those who read it will laugh and cry and gain a wider perspective of the world and the people in it who are really all so similar to ourselves in their hopes for a peaceful and productive life. You might also try reading the co-writer, Tamim Ansary's own memoir, West of Kabul East of New York to learn even more about Afghanistan and our relationship to that part of the world."

1,Ugh. Don't waste your money.,"I liked the mat. That was all. The guy on the video made me want to jab my eyes out....ya...yoga is not supposed to make you MORE tense!!! Waste of money, get something better quality!"
4,I like it,"The video doesn't really use most of the props but I will use them for other videos. And the guy teaching the class is a little too much of a hippie for me. But my yoga instructor is always coming and aligning my poses for me, so I LOVE LOVE LOVE the lines for practice at home. I reccommend the kit, because you can't get a better price, and everything is quality. I like that I can see my hand and feet imprinted onto the mat, it helps me remember to stay grounded. Get the kit, but I reccomend getting some other videos to play. His workoug is quality though."
5,Praise for Yoga!,"I am an absolute begginer to Yoga & I have to say this kit is impressive. It comes with everything a Yoga newcomer would need & includes a DVD with introductions to poses that is not intimidating at all. The 40 minute workout portion of the DVD is also great & trust me when I say you will very quickly realize what Yoga will do for your mind & body. I do find myself snickering at times at the very ""mother earth"" terminology used in Yoga by this specific instructor, but I found the overall workout very satisfying. It is also very nice that two guides are employed for novice vs. more advanced pose stances. Give this a shot & see what Yoga really has to offer. It is not impossible & you will find your body responding more willingly with each workout. Overall, this is a great alternative to the gym or jogging/walking."
5,yoga kit,"this yoga kit is actually great. the design in the middle helps to keep you ""aligned"" when doing some of the poses. The mat is smaller than my other mat but better because of the middle line. Blocks and other acessories are great. Wish the net bag were larger. Very good. Thanks,Ann"
4,Good Set,"This was a Christmas gift for my 6 year old son. He loves it. The board does lie flat as stated in the description in contrast to what some reviewers surmise without seeing the board. The canvas case is well made and durable. The only complaint is that 3 or 4 of the pieces have rounded bottoms so they wobble a little on the board. I can probably take the felt off and flatten them but have not ventured there as of yet. This is a minor complaint, the set is a good value."
1,there's a reason it's out of print,"You can find this doorstop of a book at used bookshops for a couple dollars; it was about $30 originally. Nothing but dirt, page after page (and there are about 900), no insight or intelligence. A disgraceful biography fit only for those with subscriptions to the National Enquirer."
5,An amazing series of meditations,"This book is like a long drink of cool water, an amazing series of meditations on one of the most difficult traditions in Christianity, those last words from Jesus while on the cross. Margaret Bullitt Jonas manages to take those words and forge them into meaningful meditations for our modern lives. She reflects on forgiveness, the solace of the natural world and its terrible vulnerability, as well as power and ""sin."" This is not just for Christians, but for anyone who wants to reflect on the moral and ethical issues that bind us, in the company of a fine mind and soul."
3,"Not Bad, But Not Great","We put this in the basement bathtub. If I had put it in one of the bathrooms in the main part of the house, I would have been disappointed. The preasure is not that good in the shower head and it's hard to adjust the temp. But once we got use to it, it's not that bad...for a basement bathtub."
2,"Editor, editor where art thou?","This book could have benefitted from a ruthless editor who would have deleted the huge amount of text in christian religious allegory, the political punditry, the hyperbolic descriptions of this man's war with ""the beast"" and the juvenile, self-congratulatory prose. This book might have been about 50 pages instead of 278.If James May wrote this book to gain popular and, ultimately, legal support for Stevia he should have hired a professional writer. If a second edition is planned, I'd advise him to consider doing just that because writing for the reader isn't one of his strong points.I gave it two stars, instead of one, because there is some good information in there."
3,"Buy ""Pokemon Master Pokedex"" instead","If you are looking for a complete, easy-to-follow, well-organized Pokedex, buy ""Pokemon Master Pokedex: Prima's Official Strategy Guide"" instead. Prima's ""Pokemon Master Pokedex"" (which covers ALL Pokemon) and the ""Pokemon Gold & Silver"" Strategy Guide are much more complete and user-friendly than this ""Gold & Silver"" Pokedex (limited to just the new Pokemon), which, like Prima's ""Pokemon Yellow"" Strategy Guide, is visually eye-catching, but less complete and harder to follow than the other titles mentioned above. (Another reviewer writes that there is no map. Remember: this is a Pokedex, not a Strategy Guide that will take you step-by-step through the game.)"
2,Not a very up to date pokedex,This is not a very good pokedex to get over 2 stars. There is alot of informatation missing...especially if you are buying this book for breeding pokemon and finding pokemon.For instance it says you can't breed Ho-Oh (which you can't) but there are moves under the breedable moves list. Also it says you can catch GLIGAR in Pokemon Gold AND SILVER (you can NOT catch GLIGAR in the SIlVER version) on route 45. This pokedex is definetly NOT worth becoming dependant on if you are looking for acurate information.
2,Not everything I wanted,It had the new pokemon but it did cover all of the new moves. Also it doesn't show how to get around. It shows a map of the world but not very well. Not great insturtions
3,So it's French!?!,"I forget how I found this artist. I don't know French, or what she is singing about, but I like it."
1,Not Much To Gain,"It is a low quality video, which does not utilize its medium well. There are essentially two Alexander practicioners who speak in gross generalities, regarding the practice. By no means is the viewer related any principles by which to practice this technique. It is more like a sales video, which you would get free in the mail in order to encourage you to enroll in a class. It carefully avoids any practical information."
3,A perfectly adequate read,"A perfectly adequate read. I liked both lead characters, but the mystery didn't live up to its hype. Honestly, the author should have cut the mystery down by at least half.I wish that some of the details of Patience's background had been revealed in conversation rather than just in her mind (she could have told Thomas why she'd never gone fishing, instead of just thinking about it). That would have helped establish more emotion between the two.Best about this book: I really enjoyed that Thomas got awkward whenever things started to get real. When he realized that Patience's reputation was undeserved he got as foot-in-mouth as Patience.Minor complaint: Thomas smirked with far too great a frequency, but somewhere near the end the author poked fun at his tendency to smirk and lounge against every surface in sight which nearly made up for it."
4,...,"Very cute tale. The plot was boring for the first few chapters, I know. But it gets better. The romance is slow too. But at the end it all comes together very nicely. I wouldn't say this book was perfect, but it definitely deserves more than just a few stars."
2,COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER,"The story line was interesting, but the characters left a lot to be desired. It just dragged on without much meaning or romance.I could barely get to the end fast enough."
1,BORING,"I read romance to escape like everyone else the drudgery that which is the everyday. Boy, was I disappointed, sorry but she is definitely not a skilled writer because the characters were 1 demensional and plot and dialogue so cliche I was fighting to stay awake. And the sensual scenes? What sensual scenes??? No romance, no plot, and no sensuality."
2,VEERRRRYYYY slow basic stretching,"I tried her other Spirit flow almost a year ago & wrote a lengthy review. She moves so slow, you'll fall asleep. She does basic exercises that most dance, etc. use as warm up & she then proceeds to take a 5-7 min warm up & turn it into 22 min.This is best for those who are totally out of shape or can't exercise. Otherwise save your money.The production quality is great & I do agree if she has that big a chest (hey she was born lucky), she shouldn't be wearing such a low-cut tank shirt & the bikini on the beach scene... it must be for the men.I'd write what's in it, but I don't have to since you can see almost the whole thing on youtube."
3,"a good resource for schools, not summer camp","I run a C.S.I. (Camp Scene Investegation) program and Spy Training Camp at Girl Scout summer camp. I bought this book to help plan what my crime will be for C.S.I., what clues to plant, etc.While it's a good resource to have, this book is probably better suited for more formal educational settings... school science labs. It's sure to make for some very exciting and engaging school projects, but it a little too school like for my needs (cool school, but still school).I will use it for ideas of what my crime will look like, I'll just have to adapt the labs for a camp setting.A better choice for the camp setting would be Detective Science and Spy Sciene, both by Jim Wiese. I've used both books for a couple years and find them really useful."
5,Book,Extremely helpful in the classroom. Activities are appropriate for students in grades 6 and under. Fun!
4,Breathtaking,"I purchased these as a mothers day gift, and they are even more beautiful in person. Excellent quality."
3,Nice CD,Nice one to add to my collection. Shipping was quick and it arrived in great condition. I was not aware that the CD only had 2 songs on it. 2 versions of Moment of Glory
2,CURSING NOT FUN,"The live show recordings has curse words from the black race (That is where it is from, not being prejudice). And a few from white race. So it spoiled the great songs I thought. I am going to buy the old studio albums CDs, and throw away the live CD I got."
2,Unimpressed,Not a good live performance. The band is not in sync. Godz original debut album is the one to buy.
1,Enough already,"I will admit that I used to think 'The Godz' were amazing.( of course I was only 16 years old at the time). I grew up in Ohio, not far from Columbus andthey opened for 'Blue Oyster Cult' on their Spectres tour in March 1977 at the Fairgrounds' Arena in Columbus. I do find it quite amusing that 18 yearslater, The Godz Greatest Hits Live was recorded at the Al Rosa Villa (a small club in Columbus), and they were playing, almost exactly, the same set of songs they did almost 20 years earlier acting as if they were Aerosmith. I almost feel sorry for them because most of reviews are 4 or 5 stars.I find that this would tantamount to getting all worked up over 'The Carpenters' or 'The Cowsills', or even 'The Archies"". Let it go."
5,Anatomy Review,This text book is very informative and easy to understand. We bought this and the Intro to the Human Body Study Guide. It comes with an interactive CD which enhances the curriculum.
2,ehh,"If you are going to take Anatomy and Physiology in school, you may want to just buy some interactive software to help get you familiar with the systems and etc. Otherwise just wait for getting your texbook from class or buy the textbook for class early before classes and use it."
4,Heart Attack Is Preventable,"In this highly informative book, Dr Michel Magadam tells you 20 Risk factors of Heart Attack. A person who suffered a heart attach should read this book. It is definitely going to change his life style for ever. As long as you stick to the programs of Dr Michel, you will be free from another heart attack and feel better in many ways. He has given a most suitable diet for patients with heart disease, hyper tension, diabetes and cholesterol.There are 2 things I couldn't put down. This book and my cup of S o y f e e. It's made from organic soyabeans which you brew just like coffee. No caffeine and I don't miss it either. Look for on the web at www. S oycoffee.com"
2,Old Information,"While much of the information in this book is still valid, none of it was new to me, and some of it is no longer valid. This was disappointing."
2,"The book looked a lot larger, but it is only 4x6 with minimal information.","Just too small, it should be at least 8x10 in size with more information on size and substance for that price."
2,Some Useful Advice and A Great Deal of Fluff and Irony,"Mark Breier's writing style is easy to read and quite enjoyable. I found many parts of his book to be insightful but lacking in any real tactical approaches. If you need to read a whole chapter on how important e-mail is, you shouldn't be in the Internet business at all. Many examples in the book are ironic given Beyond.com's current state of affairs. The author could do with a little less hubris and more common sense about why so many online business struggle despite the rules of the new economy."
1,A relic even before it hit store shelves,"This book should be where beyond.com is right now - in the trash. A perfect example of the smug ""there at the right time"" internet millionaire espousing common sense, and uncommon nonsense as business practice.The tone of the book clearly broadcasts the authors ego and self importance. The content, however, reveals the truth; the bubble was always just full of hot air.If are searching for a reference to help improve your management skills, look elsewhere."
3,"Useful pointers, but are they enough!","The book is all about how to get things done fast in the internet age. Particularly the sections pertaining to replying to emails. When ""Inbox"" is crowded with hundred's of email, a policy such as replying to a message within 24 hours is useful. This book gives such directions, but the policy that is to be manifested relies on the reader.This is one of those books that provide a good reading and if the reader is commited to improving his speed and efficiency then the real benefit will accrue.This book is NOT useful for recalcitrant folks who do not want to learn from experience.In many places, the author seems to indicate his selfish attitude by many references to ""I"" when in fact his entire team would have provided help."
2,This is a pre dot-bomb era title,"This book was written in and about the time before the dot-com's collapsed. I was hoping to get some real advice on running an internet enabled group, and was very dissapointed to find that this book is basically a day in the life of a work-a-holic .com CEO before his bubble burst.This is not a book I could suggest is worth your time or money if you are looking to get real ideas and lesson learned for use in your own business or job. Some pre dot-bomb books have lasted the test of time in the couple years since...this one has not. ""The Customer Revolution"" is a good example of a pre dot-bomb tech/business book that is still worth reading or listening to. Go look at that, or the many other still relevent books. Move along...nothing to see here folks."
2,"If he knew so much, why are all of his companies bankrupt?","Reading this book today is like reading a book of jokes. When the author wrote this, he was riding the wave of ""internet madness"" that walloped Wall Street with outrageous stock prices for companies that never produced any profit. Mark Breier was simply a man at the right place at the right time and any insights he has on how to effectively run a business is hindered by the facts that both beyond.com and software.net are now nowhere to be found on the internet.However, an enterprising entrepreneur can read this book and learn what not to do. In addition, there is a paragraph or two that talks about venture capital personalities you will encounter.In summary, do not buy this book if you are looking for successful ways to run your business as a manager. Taking much of his advise will undoubtedly bring you to his final demise. (In fact, he is no longer a CEO; he is back to Chief of Marketing)"
1,Loaded with contradictions and irony,"This book probably had a little more pop in the early part of 2000, but it's obvious now after the demise of most Dot Com's that much of the author's advice is unproven. Companies he continually references, Amazon.com and Beyond.com, did see tremendous stock gains and gave their managers a false sense of success. I also felt like the author contradicted himself many times throughout the text. For example, he spent a great deal of time preaching the importance of customer feedback and response via email, only to later warn of the great dangers involved with communicating with your customers via on-line forums. They're both just channels of communication and good judgment needs to be used when communicating regardless of the medium."
4,Quick Business Refresher,"The 10-Second Internet Manager re-introduces us to the timeless business drivers - customer service, brand, operational efficiency, etc. Rather that simply rehash old ideas, Mark packages these business fundamentals with creative ideas for using the internet to adapt and optimize them for managing successful businesses in an age where customers expect solutions immediately."
3,A so-so follow-up to a great solo debut,"While not as uniformly excellent as his 1984 solo debut ""Read My Lips"", Tubes front-man Fee Waybill offers up some interesting, if uneven, melodies with his trademark lyric comic zest. He is aided by friend and part-time collaborator Richard Marx, on whose 1st album Fee can be heard singing background vocals. (Marx's wife, Cynthia Rhodes, once toured with the Tubes as a dancer back in the early 1980's). Though Fee's attempts to record more ""serious"" tunes may not remind fans of the magic of his Tubes heydey, there is just enough gusto in this record to remind us why he is one of the more interesting songwriters/singers in the biz. But if you only buy one Fee solo disc, ""Read My Lips"" is the better choice."
1,Dun & Bradstreet Guide-Nancy Dunnan,"I ordered this book on March 2, 2002 and it still hasn't arrived. How can I rate a book I didn't receive? I wish to delete this book and substitute another but find no procedure to do this. Can you help me do this?"
1,Tediously brief,"I cannot think why this book was ever published: it is badly written and lifeless. ""The Reckoning"" by Charles Nicholl is an infinitely better book on the same subject."
2,A brief and weak book,"This novella does successfully capture the flavor of the times, but it ultimately cannot decide what it wants to be -- a mystery? a pseudo-memoir? an exploration of the last days of a man who suspects his time is up?It makes an attempt at all of these, but doesn't succeed in any of them. For a short piece of fiction, the writing needs to be absolutely concrete with nothing extraneous, but there are scenes (such as an episode with Dr. John Dee) that, while interesting, do nothing to move the story forward - and there are a couple of soft porn sex scenes that are not only unnecessary, but so poorly written as to be almost comical, which certainly breaks the flow of the story."
2,"interesting concept, poorly executed","""The secret life of Kit Marlow"" is an interesting concept: intrigue, sex. violence, betrayal, poetry. However, the book is pulpy, tedious and unsatisfying."
2,Unsatisfying speculation on the death of Marlowe,"Christopher Marlowe's mysterious death has been the fodder for many a novel.This one is not terribly successful. Writing in the first-person, from Marlowe's point of view, Welsh posits that Marlowe, having been ""set up"" by an envious actor at the behest of ""powerful men"", chooses death rather than implicate Raleigh in order, like Achilles, to gain everlasting fame. The plotting is weak and vague, and the motivations of those behind Marlowe's downfall are never terribly clear."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"A very dull, though mercifully short read. Faulty historical details and grammatical inaccuracies abound. The author and the editor both dropped the ball here."
5,An Essential Handbook for Norton Owners,"Norton lovers the world over swear by these workshop manuals and for good reason. They are well illustrated, offer step by step guides to complicated procedures and are comprehensive. I have these manuals for all my classic motorcycles and would/could not do without them. Add this to your motorcycle publications and you won't be dissappointed."
1,Absolute junk. I am not a novice when it comes to trains. Flimsy. Coming apart.,"Not well built at all. Would never buy this again. The workmanship from Bachmann is TERRIBLE. TERRIBLE. TERRIBLE. Even for HO scale, utter shame."
5,"Finally, Emo on CD - now if we'd just get the rest...","I've been waiting for an Emo CD for years. This is after seeing Emo several times in concert (a couple of times in the 80s and a more recent viewing in San Francisco). Emo's LPs, E=MO2 and at the Hasty Pudding, are comedy legends. This CD brings us up to date, kind of presenting the best of Emo's humour since those LPs. Some of the jokes on the CD are old (I heard them live back in the late 80s) while some are new. But, regardless, they are all quite a joy to hear.Now, if someone would just get on the stick and get those two albums releases as CDs, we could all live in peace and harmony. (Sony Canada has given in to my demands, so now all is as it should be)"
5,Great CD!,"Love this CD....its great if you like Electronic, classy, lounge type music...awesome beats!"
3,Not De Nova and a little more Rolling Stones,"The Redwalls wear their influences on their sleeves. If you like the Beatles meets Rolling Stones with a little country flair then you'll love this album. Listen to their second album, De Nova, and you'll realize just how good this Chicago band is. This album lacks the maturaty of De Nova and there's more Rolling Stones on this then the usually present Beatles, but a hidden gem none the less. If De Nova is a 4, maybe 5 star album, I have to give this one 3."
1,False advertisement,"When I purchased the item ( CD ) the product description said NEW, so I expected a new wrapped CD. When I received the package the CD was definitely not new, had scratches, and the case was cracked. I e-mailed the seller and he expressed no remorse. I asked for a full-refund, he then cut of all communication with me. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND NOT BUYING ANYTHING FROM THIS SELLER!"
4,Good stuff,"I haved not seen them live, but the lead singer from my band (Quiet Kid shameless plug) has and says they have phenomenal energy. Their album is quite good and has a great sound to it, so I imagine them live would be awesome. Very consistant quality, but still varied enough that you dont feel like you're hearing the same song over and over. I'd love to see them live. Pick it up!!"
1,Call Girl,I have very sick lately and i just opened up my package from you'll and started looking at it..the middle of my movie is totally mess up and when you receive this i like to know what are you going to do about my movie.I would like for you to put the money back on my debt card. You can email me when you get this. Thanks!!!
3,the author is fascinating,"I haven't read Mr. Larson's book as yet, but my husband and I met him on the public landing in Camden, Maine on Christmas Day 2005. He is a fascinating man with a multitude of stories and lots of personal magnetism. If his book is as good as his oral anecdotes, it's bound to be a good read.C. Stanley"
1,Inappropriate for youngest readers,"Slavery, prison, and taxes are immediately and clumsily introduced. These topics are far beyond a four-year-old, and trying to explain them to a small child is not going to help bedtime. The dark imagery in the illustrations doesn't help.Emotionally secure older children can accept these themes and move on to the fantasy better executed in Harold and the Purple Crayon. Beyond age-appropriateness, this book is just not as well-written as the earlier Fitchburg and Cabin."
3,Slavery or the Mexican War,"Henry Climbs A Mountain is a lovely book with the ideas Thoreau may have had in jail coming to life in Henry's fitful night in jail. However, the author gives a brief background on Thoreau at the end of the book which states that Henry David Thoreau went to jail for not paying taxes to a government that supported slavery when, according to his biographical information, he didn't pay taxes because he chose not to support the Mexican War. The lack of accuracy is a problem as I am not sure anyone unfamiliar with Thoreau would check this information."
4,Basic info,"This book would be a great resource for someone with no or minimal medical training i.e.: advanced first aid, etc. It is well laid out and very easy to read. The way it is laid out and printed it would be a good guide in a disaster or emergency setting or if you are a long distance away from medical help. All in all worth the money, and it is a good addition to my bookshelf and to loan out to those that want more knowledge and to increase their skill base.The shipping was very fast and the book came in well padded and safe. I am well pleased with my purchase."
1,Stereotypical white male claptrap disparaging asians,"It doesn't get more racist and stereotypical than this. The director tries to justify the ""white knight"" portrayal that often disparages asian men as well as asian women. The predominate stereotype is that asians are incapable of doing anything without a white hero. Asian men are emasculated as usual in this American media depiction which was created with patronizing white male fantasies in mind. Please watch films by Wong Kar Wai or early Ang Lee for Chinese movies about real Chinese culture. Avoid nonsense directed by individuals such as Steven Dunning because they are skewed in their racial perception. Asian community action groups have been contacted and we will actively boycott this director and campaign against his sponsors."
1,I can't believe this,"I've heard about this film for a short while. I finally saw it.What a horrible and racist film. The characters are almost cartoonishly evil and the only voice of reason is an American WHITE man.I'm sure none of the people who reviewed this racist lie about the Chinese community positively, are even Asian. No, this is NOT how the Chinese community is. I'm sure there are a few individuals who are like that, but they also exist in every race.Asians are human... not cruel, heartless and/or naive, as depicted in this lie of a film."
1,Yet another unoriginal film,"What it basically boils down to is the following:An Asian woman is oppressed by her own kind. Lady luck smiles at her, however, when the Caucasian man of her dreams shows her how truly wonderful life can be.Spend your money more wisely, especially now that the economy is in a rut."
1,asianmike...you are either a,"dumbass Asian or you are Steve Dunning. Whichever you are, please go f**k yourself and stop hyping this racist film!"
5,Shut up asian male cry babies- live our asian female life!,"I just wonder what is to become of Lee. Her sadness and anger must be so vast.Can she overcome that and really live?...We all have such sadnessin us....that is why we relate to her.....But at one point I could almoststand no more hardship for her.......and the reality of a real lifewoman in that situation is usually FAR worse. See the article in the San Francisco Weekly Feb 2004 entitled ""Enslaved in Palo Alto"""
1,Another White Male to the Rescue Movie...,"I give this move ZERO STARS!!! I had to rate it something otherwise I couldn't submit this review!WTF! Yet another movie emasculating Asian Men. Another White dude coming to the rescue of an Asian Women who's supposedly mistreated by her ""own"" kind. What? You mean to tell me that there are no kind, caring, compassionate, sympathetic, Asian Men? This White-man to the rescue theme has been done over and over again by White controlled Hollywood that it's sickening! Do yourself a favor...SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!"
1,This film is RACIST,Valiant white man rescues poor Asian female flower blossom.Doesn't something smell fishy in the plot of this film?
1,The most racist movie I have ever seen.,"Honestly, folks, don't be fooled. This movie is the most stereotypical and racist films I have ever seen. It is amazing that we are in the year 2004 and that such awful portrayals of minorities could still exist in films like this.Being a white man, I won't speak on behalf of the Asian people, but I know racism when I see it, and this movie is racist. The Asian characters are stiff, lifeless, and full of unhumanistic qualities that I was ready to shut off my DVD player and read a book. What was Steve Dunning thinking?I can also guarantee that Steve Dunning is probably calling all his croonies to come and inflate his ego by praising his movie in the reviews who give him nothing but 5 stars. How pathetic. Don't be fooled. This is a terrible movie."
3,A Higher Court,I thought this book to be a bit strange for my taste. I didn't feel that the subject matter was very interesting.
4,When is a torx bit not a torx bit?,"When it is a star bit.These Bondhus Star wrenches fit torx sizes 6 through 25. The description says ""Long Length"" so I expected them to be like the long allen keys I already own - about 6"" for the longest of the set. Instead they are roughly half that long. While this isn't a problem, it was surprising and I have to wonder how short the not ""long"" versions are.Torx by name or not, they fit well in all the torx fasteners I've tried."
1,Awful! And a bad rip-off of a great album Festival of Light,I could barely listen to this album which I purchased because the other reviews were good. I think they were all written by the author himself. Worse is that it is a BAD rip-off of an authentic and wonderful 2 volume Hannukah album called Festival of Light. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS RIP-OFF! HERE IS A LINK TO THE REAL THING:Festival of Light
1,NOT FOR ME,"I have been taking multiple herbs, some better than others but these are by far the worse & my least fav. It makes me feel low & droggy the next day & the sleep benefits are nothing to speak of, minimum at best. Im so jealous. :("
4,"work well, maybe too well","i was going through a rough patch and was having trouble sleeping. they will definitely do the job. but i still found myself tired after 8 hours, it was hard to wake up"
4,Aha! Sleep!,"This is pretty amazing stuff. The staying power is a little low, however. I was prescribed Elavil after I got out of rehab for multiple addictions. That was odd that I was taking drugs for taking drugs, so I was always on the lookout for a way to get off it.I found this product, ordered it, and tapered off a 2-year stint on that medication. I'm now off prescribed drugs all together. I would talk to your doctor before substituting like this...I did. It stopped working, but I take it anyway because I'm an addict, and that's what I do. Kids, don't do drugs. If you have done drugs, do this. It's cheaper, and natural."
1,"Innacurate , buy his Mother's book ""My Boy' ! THE TRUTH",Im glad Philo is not around to read this bilge. A discography of biased lies
1,What's Marcus' day job?,"I rate it as 1 star, because zero (or less) is not listed as a choice. Mr. Marcus has proved, once more, that most film critics are essentially clueless. See the movie. Read Condon's book. Forget this drivel. If you think you have to read this book, check it out at the library."
1,Hopeless entrant in fine series,"This book contains bad writing and has absolutely no focus, The Manchurian Candidate is an important film and the BFI film classics should be the highpoint of film criticism. This book wanders all over the place and cannot focus on the film. Coupled with some of third rate writing and muddled thinking, the book should only be bought if you must have all the books in the series. Don't buy it.The BFI editors should be embarassed for having released it."
5,"Great value, and fun","This truck is very durable, and you can't beat its value. I got it for about $5, so it was very worth it."
2,2& 1/2 stars,"what is with all of Dotty X solos joints?? He is one of the best rappers, flows of all time. But the beats he choose aside from a few just don't cut it. I always remeber hearing X on Diamond D's Day in the the life of 3 black men and Tribe's business of low end theory. But the beats on this album are uninteresting, just like experience and education. If you like SaDAT X, don't buy his solos as they aren't good at showcasing a true legend. Get all of the Brand Nubian CD's first. Sadat needs to hook up with producers like Madlib and his brother Oh No. Or maybe get Diamond to quit the 808 bull and dig in the crates. A.G. comes out with a hot new album with producers on it and kills it, and Sadat falls flat again over equally flat production. I payed $25 on Amazon to get this and Experience and Education, and this is what I get? Come on X, you ain't even flowing over half these tracks. Damn Shame"
5,excellent!,"A great and informative book about MPAs and cetaceans around the globe. This is a guide for students, whale watchers, managers, policy-makers, scientists and anyone interested in the future of our oceans and its inhabitants. Read it and share it with others!"
2,"Great concept, wrong product","Elsa discontinued their glasses because, to be honest, they were premature and did not work well. I purchased a pair about 3 years ago and loved the 3D, but the heavy flickering gave me headaches and not many games worked. I have since come across the edimensional.com glasses, and read a large number of glowing reviews. I decided to give them a try and was not disappointed. They are official nvidia recommended 3D glasses and nvidia has drivers specifically for their glasses. they have a much more powerful VGA adapter than the little cord the revelators came with and the flickering is greatly reduced. many more games work as well and the look truly stunning. you really get a sense of speed and depth and height in simulators and FPS games have body parts shooting out at you!! try them instead and i'm sure you won't be disappointed."
4,Wings of Obsession,"This debut feature from director Juanma Bajo Ulloa, a dark tale of obsession, set the tone for his future films Dead Mother, and Open Your Eyes. It concerns the relationship between a girl and her mother after the latter's obsessive need to grant her husband a male heir. The situations that develop from what would hardly be considered a plot point in the hands of a lesser director lead to the tense brow-beating conclusion of one of Spain's most offbeat art films. Butterfly Wings explores the dynamics that arise within the different relationships the characters have with each other, nary an angle unexamined. Rich in character development as well as eye candy, it remains both unsettling and richly satisfying."
5,Gus is very cool!!,Gus is a very good musician!! try it and you will see!!! I recommend this album to everyone.
2,A book with no meaning,"The silly story and pictures are clearly influenced by Dr. Seuss, but since there's no meaning or point to the story, it completely fails to copy any of the quality of a Seuss book. When the author couldn't think of a meaningful rhyme, he just picked things out of thin air like talking about an ""odd sock wood"" being ""A place where goblins And ogres meet To talk about socks and Wiffy feet!"" The book appears to be a miss-mosh of unrelated nonsense poems done by a child and strung together without thought. My 8 year old boy found this whole book meaningless. Maybe a child of 4 or 5 might find the nonsense amusing, but unfortunately there are a sufficient number of complicated words (e.g. vaguely,meringue,absurd) that would surely bore that age group. I'm not sure how this book got published. Don't waste your money."
2,Poor visual quality,...and rough editting. The opening credits say that the filmmaker started out with $300 and a camcorder. You've been forewarned.
4,Keepin' it Reel,"Sex Drugs & Comedy is a great film! This gritty documentary, shot ""guerilla style"" makes you feel like you really are a part of this band of ""misfits of merriment"" while they travel the country making their living as stand up comedians. Each time I watch the film I see something different, something new or funny or even sad is revealed. Comedy isn't always fun & games but like the title suggest its at least one third of what makes for a pretty interesting night!"
3,Good but not great.,"There's a lot of good information in this book but I would not recommend it as a reference.First of all, it isn't totable: it's format makes it a clunker. It's 8 1/2 by 11"" and its page format is such that the book could have been printed with half the paper. The added appendices are pretty useless considering the main A to Z section entries pretty much tell you exactly the same thing.Second of all, the formatting is inconsistent; adding question to your inquiry. Did they make this entry as complete as they did that one?I very much prefer Meletis/Jacobs' and Brinker's books to this one. For intuitiveness and extensive cross-referencing, Meletis/Jacobs' wins hands down."
3,Good but not current enough for me.,"I am taking a medication that isn't BRAND new to the market but isn't by any means OLD either. It has been released within the last 4 years. I was hoping it would be in this book as I am also taking herbal supplements, but it wasn't. There were other drugs that were supposed to be for the same conditions, but since they are different chemicals the interactions were potentially different, so I didn't find this helpful.That said, there are plenty of maintstream medications like antibiotics, etc. included in this book so it might be helpful to some folks. I just think that drugs, like computers, change so quickly that books like this can't cover everything. I am on the fence with my recommendation on this one."
3,Doesn't list everything,"Book is 2006, yet doesn't list some of the RX's I take. Hard to use, also. Some RX's are only listed generically, so you need a computer to check the brand name first."
5,About the A-Z Guide to Drug-Herb-Vitamin Interactions,"Fantastic, very informative. I am an EMS Officer at my place of employment and this Book gives me information that I did not know about in all my training.Thanks, DorisA-Z Guide to Drug-Herb-Vitamin Interactions Revised and Expanded 2nd Edition: Improve Your Health and Avoid Side Effects When Using Common Medications and Natural Supplements Together"
5,Excellent Reference,I use this drug-herb-vitamin interactions reference in the pharmacology courses I teach. It is an excellent introduction to the concept that all of the things humans ingest may either help or hurt. It is also a good check to the marketing strategies used to sell non-FDA regulated medicinals to consumers.
1,See what?,I bought this light because I needed a light that would allow me to see the road without street lights (I live in a rural neighborhood). I am very disappointed with this light. The light dissipates to fast. The only way I can see the road is if I point the light directly in front of my front tire. If I point the light in front of me a little ways so that I can ride instead of walk the light dissipates very fast and I can see very little. This light might be fine if you want to be seen but if you want to see get something els.
5,Just What the Doctor Ordered,"After having had both hands operated on for carpal tunnel this summer, I was only able to afford a limited number of physical therapy sessions due to limited insurance coverage. I decided to look on Amazon to see if there were any types of aids that were being used in my PT available and lo and behold I came up with all the things I looked for and at very reasonable prices. Thank you, Amazon!"
4,Great for PT of Injured Hand,"I shattered the fourth metacarpal of my right hand several months ago and am still doing physical therapy to regain full use of my hand. This device is great in that you can work individual digits, even placing different figure joints on the buttons to work different hand muscles. They come in several gradations as appropriate for the hand's initial strength. This particular one, at 3 lbs. was a good one to start out at for the current state of my hand. Beats trying to make do with uncallibrated rubber bands."
4,Digi-Flex hand Exerciser 3 lb.,I had a broken wrist and my physical therapist recommended this product.I already tried and have been able to move my fingers better.It is an excellent product.
4,This was a gift,"I am not sure of the content of the this manual since this was a gift for my father for his 1966 Vespa 90. I assume that is contains sufficient info to totally rebuild this with him.I own MANY Haynes manuals for cars and trucks so I expect that this will be as detailed. (Although, I must say that is is REALLY thin. Maybe there is not much to them nor much difference in the models...)"
2,Haynes disappoints vespa fan,A very thin book and little actual technical information. Do not bother buying this manual. With a little patience you can find all this information and more on the internet at sites such as scooterhelp for free.
3,"its small and simple, but so are vespa scooters",There arent very many Vespa scooter repair manuals out there that are in english. So why not get this one?
4,rising water,"Rising Water is about a car thief that isn't the sort of person you'd expect to find helping out an animal shelter. But to make up for his crime, Kevin is sent to help Tracy and her brother, Luke- and none of them knows what to expect. When heavy winter rains cause the town's levee to break, the teenagers are forced to skip orientation and help with the rescue effort. Within moment they're in a powerboat pack with sandwiches and supplies and out on the water. Their mission runs smoothly until armed thieves, caught in the act of stealing from a flood home, kidnapped Luke. In a heartbeat, the rescue effort turns toward Tracy's brother- and unless she and Kevin can band together, there's no way for survival."
4,Recorder 2 Plus,"The recorder works just fine, but I found the manual not as clear about some of the operations as I would have liked. It took me over an hour to figure out how to complete some of the operations, and I've been working with electronic products for over 30 years. That's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. I use this recorder with my home survellience system, as I have 2 cameras monitoring my home when I am gone. I have to use it in the 640 resolution because my monitor is a TV set, and in this highest resolution it will only record for 5 hours. But that's better than the 2 hours I was getting when recording to my DVD recorder."
4,Works Great! Perfect for Ipod and Treo,"Originally picked up a V-Mate from Sandisk, but the Neuros outperforms in terms of features and video quality."
3,Neuros MPEG-4 Recorder,"This product generally did what I purchased it to do, mainly record video from several sources, DVR and digital video camera and allow me to play them on my ipod. The recorded quality was very good and I was able to view my videos on both my ipod and smartphone. My only complaint is with the build quality. Both the cable connections for the video and the power supply shorted in and out when wiggled even slightly. Had this not been a problem I would have rated it with 4 or 5 stars."
1,what the hell,the item did what it was advertised to do at first i converted all the movies i wanted then out of the blue it just stopped working. the device will not even turn on. I would say good product but for a limited time only ... if it cost 25 bucks then i would say it was worth the money now i have to order another one.
1,This thing just did not work,"I only gave this product a star because I couldn't go any lower. This machine is completely unreliable. When it works it works wonderful, but it has not worked more than it has worked for me. The main problem was the formating requirements to make the memory card compatible with the recorder. If your really computer savvy it may be worth buying. But it your not, like me, I would strongly recommend against it."
1,confused?,"I brought it so I could record TV shows on a sd card and watch on my palm. However I have not learn to work it yet? I don't want to give it a bad rating, however I'm pretty good with equipment but haven't been able to work this device yet?"
3,Cute BUT.....,"I ordered these shoes because they are cute but the fit was off. One shoe felt 1/2 size smaller so one peep hole was bigger than the other. Two of my toes came out of one shoe and NONE and the other. It looked funny. I really wanted to keep them because they cute. Okay now,the ONE shoe that did fit. Comfort was there, width was fine, the only thing is the strap in the back of the heel hurts. It's stiff,I'm thinking it will soften up a bit with time. I'm fighting myself in ordering them and giving them a second chance. They are cute and look better in person than the photo. If you have the time and patience then I would get them. Good Luck:)"
4,Pretty good pourers...,"Bought these for use in the kitchen: oils, vinagers, sauces, syrups, etc. They work great, but if i had to do it again i'd opt for theFlip-Top Metal Bottle Pourer Set of 6instead. i get a little paranoid about some creepy crawler making it's way into one of the spouts. In fact i just might order those flip-tops next!"
1,"Cheap, awful, leaky pourers...",I tried these in a number of different liquor bottles and they leaked in every one. I don't recommend these for anyone...
3,Cheap spouts,"These are basically cheap pouring spouts that are probably good for a one-time use occasion. They are more for show than function. If you are looking at these as a long-term addition to your bar equipment, then look elsewhere. The quality is not great and there is some leaking, but If you will only use them occasionally then maybe it is not that bad."
3,A little leaky,"These pourers can be a good fit for some bottles, but other bottles leak during a long pour. For the low price it isn't bad."
2,Cheap Materials...,"The material used on the sealing rings is far too stiff, and likes to pop the pourer right off the top of my bottle. Won't work with Sailor Jerry, that's a deal killer! I was trying to save a few bucks over the Oxo brand pourers but am now regretting it. The Oxo's have treated me well!"
2,Too small for a regular olive oil bottle,"We really wanted to get spouts for oil oil and vinegar bottles, but these are too small, at least for anything other than the smallest bottles of 365 brand olive oil from Whole Foods, which is what we use. It seems like a big pain to pour the olive oil into a bottle witha smaller neck just so we can use the spout . . ."
2,Poor fit. Messy.,"My initial reaction when I opened the package was that these were going to be a great addition to my bar. I was very wrong. I purchased these because I was going to be bartending (first time) at a friends party. I quickly learned that these pourers don't fit very tight, and even if they did, they have to be held at a specific angle in order to keep them from leaking. The little air-relief hole needs to be at the 12 o'clock position in order to prevent leaks.For this beginner, the flow rate is good. Not too fast. Not too slow.I'll probably continue to use them for smaller gatherings where I'm only making a few drinks, and can closely pay attention to their position. But certainly not in a busy environment."
4,Cheap but useful,These make pouring liquor into shot glasses so much easier and less messy than straight from the wide mouth of the bottle. The only problem that I had was that one of them had a slight dent in the chrome where it met up with the rubber so it leaked a little. Solved the problem of the slight leak using a simple food grade glue. Overall an excellent deal for anyone who has parties or mixes a lot of drinks.
2,No Heating Element,I did not open the box or try the product. It has no heating element to dry the boots and would probally take forever if they were soaked? This product should not be classifed as a dryer because of no heat cycle. It is simply a low pressure blowing system and requires 4 D size batteries to operate. An adapter for 110VAC is available but not from them. You have to get it from another source and there are no specifics on the box who you can get it from or what you need. Maybe inside the box? I can not say it would not dry the boots gently as stated I am just stating my opinion as to the time requirement and adapter required.
2,I'm sure it works fine,"I'm sure it works fine, but I missed the fine print that said D Battery ONLY. Yes it comes with a spot for an adapter, but I think it should be included."
1,I guess you get what you pay for,This product is garbage. Doesn't work AT ALL. Don't bother ordering one of these. Totally worthless piece of junk. a
3,It was good,This item was in great condition. But it do not come with a cord to plug it in. Although it does take batteries.
2,no heat,This thing doesn't blow warm air at all to dry the boots or gloves. If you use it for gloves your hands are cold before you go outside.
1,disappointing,"This item does not Come with the power cord, is pretty loud and takes quite a while to dry boots."
1,did not realize,"i did not realize that this device was battery operated. It has the option to have a wall plug in but they were to cheap to include it and it seems to me that the ""dryer"" only blows cold air...........really. So yes this is a cheap boot dryer and you get what you pay for except when you add up all of the batteries that you will have to buy to blow cold air into your boots.........."
1,BOOT SNEAKER DRYER,"I have not taken this out of the box yet. Waiting for the right moment. I'm sorry to say that I can not give a specific review as of today, 2/27/08."
1,Noth worth a penny...,"Mr Adair portrays the less than original English character of Gideon who takes a teaching post at a Berlitz school in Paris in the 1980s. After getting to know the gay scene, Gideon witnesses his acquaintances fall under the spell if the first Aids wave as the result of their wild fornication and libertine banter.Readers will find very little compassion for any of the characters. The language is crude, the tale banal. Had Mr Adair published his novel 15 years ago, it may have been of interest but unfortunately today, what the author presents as ""a true story"" in page 1 is completely devoid of originality."
1,Pretentious & ridiculous,Original turns of phrase do not a novel make. One wonders what exactly the author's intention was.
3,Useful but a bit directionless,"I have to admit I can't help but be disappointed with this book. It starts out well with a discussion of the industry (with almost a little too much personal bias for my taste). The author spends a nice chapter discussing some admirable features of some prominent RTS games, but if you've played any of them, you probably picked them out already. Still, nice to have in a single place.Then, the book begins to go downhill, for no real reason other than it seems to lack direction. When you begin reading about DirectX and coding, the author tosses a bunch of information at you, but fails to put together a 'big picture' of how you would apply everything in a coherent vision. Each chapter has its share of useful factoids, but they seem to be scattered rather haphazardly.I will say that the author is very responsive to email, and supplied this reader with the new source code in less than a day. This is a useful book, but could use some extra work in bringing it all together."
1,Very poor book,"This book doesn't cover most interesting aspects of RTS programming, and it deals instead with the basic details of DirectX and Windows programming. Anything of interest, you can find on the web in more detail.It had potential for so much more! What a complete dissapointment. Save your money and spend it in something else."
1,Worst book ever,I can't believe how bad this book was. It gives simple concepts and then beats them to death with pages and pages of code. The author only touches on the truly difficult problems and refers the reader to web sites for the real material. He fills the pages with endless prose containing little substance.I bought this used for $5 and I paid too much.
4,Decent,"This is an excellent introduction to the difficulties and concepts involved in the creation of RTS/RTT games. It is not a book on how to write games in DirectX. It is not a book about DirectX. The book's stated goal is to describe the process by which RTS/RTT games are created. The author accomplishes the goal with success. While several topics are covered in detail (the path finding section for example), most topics are left alone for further research by the reader as there are well known, well respected books covering these topics (tile sets, resources vs. expenditures, threat levels vs. defensive capabilities, etc.). If you want a book describing how to create a RTS/RTT game, this is a good book. If you need a book on how to code, go elsewhere."
1,FOR ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS...,"I believe this is yet another of those 'game programming'books that builds an entire damn system from scratch, basically reworking tons of tired ideas and methods that have been covered to death in other even worse books, eg. how to plot a pixel, how to blit a bitmap, yadda, yadda.Intermediate to advanced?Not by a long shot. Absolute beginner.Real-time strategy?Some beginner stuff about tiles and pathing, easy to find on the web. I expected to see a fellow game developer share some gems, but found another hard-coded, simplistic, limited, and entirely unrealistic approach to producing a real game. This is retro...very...No goodies on the CD either.No Multiplayer or even single player for that matter discussion, except to fill a page about what you can do. I know what I can do, and want to do, and what I think is cool.Stay away unless you're a beginner and don't want to type text into a search engine. But even that's stretching it."
1,Real-Time Strategy Game Programming,I do not recommend this book! Talk about re-inventing thewheel! Much useless information. I bought this book for the pathingexamples. CD included is a waist of time. Good luck getting anything to compile! END
5,Does anybody know what ANSI is?,"He says he wrote the book in ANSI C++, but what the heck is that? If anybody knows, write me.Thanks"
3,Old and outdated.,"This book is rather outdated! The author doesn't use object orientation properly, for instance there are a lot of macros instead of const and inline functions. It isn't really that much about directX more about the fundementals of strategy game programming which might be ok. But you have to be aware of the fact that this book is not intended to be as a referance book for directX."
3,Acceptable but a little lacking,"I must say that even though as stated the book is lacking in a few areas, I found that I enjoyed the book over all. As a professional engineer I found the C++ code very readable and understandable.For those people who say that the code was too complex, go back to Visual Basic because in the real world, his code would be considered simplistic to intermediate level."
4,"Good Read, Even if You've Only Thought about Coding a Game","I picked up this book at the local bookstore, not really sure what to expect. I guess I've always thought about coding a game, and this seemed like a place to start. First, the author does an excellent job encapsulating the game industry as a whole and explain the evolution of a game from the idea to the reality. Second, the code actually explains many elements of game coding that I had never really thought about. Third he uses details examples in code to demonstrate most of these elements.The only minus to this book is that I fear many of the people that pick it up will be college kids with no coding experience. This book hits the mark for its target audience, but might miss the audience that receives it.The book does however at least give these readers a background, even if they can't understand the code yet. The Author's pure enthusiasm for the industry also is a bonus to this book.Overall one of the few ""How-to's"" I've enjoyed reading."
2,"This is a typical Bla, bla, bla book..","This could of been a good book. If all the samples worked. And if he cut down on all the bla,bla about different game types and added some good programming samples. Before I started to read this book I read DirectX Complete (by Michael D. Root, James R. Boer; Paperback) which is a well structured and good (beginners)book ( in this book you learn something new about games on each page..). In Kawicks may learn something about RTS after 200 pages of reading. The lack of good programming samples and to much bla, bla makes this book a total waste to buy."
2,POOR BOOK!,"This Book Lacks! everything is theory, only a few but few chapters have resource stuff of using at your game programing but no examples and even bad coding. Anyway, for real game programmers go to another place!."
4,An excellent journey into the world of RTS game programming.,Wonderful! This book gives you the foundation you need to begin experimenting with DirectX as well as good programming philosophy's. Very Zen.I've an entire library of game programming books and the largest detriment to retaining knowledge is a boring author; Hardly the case in this book.
1,Beginners only,"Very dissapointing! This book is clearly geared towards beginners, and yet it says it's for intermediate to advanced users.I agree with the other reviewer: there're only a few chapters that are worth anything. All the information in the book is found in the web, and much better explained most of the time."
3,Jumpy and opinionated,"Beginners, don't pick up this book to learn from! This book is poorly organized, jumping from topic-to-topic. It's a little discouraging for the beginner to pick up a book and see the chapters go from an introduction to a header file full of physics equations. Then it goes on to describe a typical schedule of a programmer, then it goes on to describe topics without much explaination. It's also discouraging to be in chapter 3 and see text referring to a description in chapter 18.If you have an advanced knowledge of C++ you may be able to get through this book with a LOT of patience."
4,Excellent phrases,"I bought this dictionary to use with Kosovar refugees I am currently teaching english. I thought it would be fun to suprise them by learning a little of their own language as well because they are working so hard. This book has many, many, fabulous phrases in the last section that apply to almost every situation. While the dictionary is small and has only a limited vocabulary, most commonly used words are available. My only problem with this book is that unlike some others, there is no real pronunciation guide so you are left guessing if you are truly pronouncing things correctly. If you are looking for correct pronunciation, I suggest getting tapes or asking a native."
3,buy this to accompany Stefanllari / Hippocrene Practical,"If you are used to the very well designed Lonely Planet or Berlitz dictionary/phrasebooks then you won't be too thrilled with Hysa's offering. However, it is the only phrasebook available for Albanian<->English at this time.Number of entries in the dictionary == paltry. More often than not, I ended up looking in Stefanllari's dictionary to find the word I wanted.I still recommend you purchase this is for the topical phrasebook and grammar sections. My Albanian wife says the vocabulary choice in this book has a bias toward Kosovar rather than 'typical modern Albanian'. But it is still adequate...and what else are you going to buy instead of it anyway?"
2,Not Enough Words,"I ordered this book for the Albanian and Macedonian students I teach in my ESL class. The book is quite solid and compact, as bilingual dictionaries go, convenient for carrying. But we have not found it to be of much use. There simply are not enough words in it. The vocabulary is very limited. More than half the time we can't find the word we're looking for. We get much better results with the monolingual Oxford Picture Dictionary for English learners."
4,Worth reading!!!,If you want to enrich your vocabulary within a short period of time and sound sensible in your writing. This book is especially useful to exchange students (like me). English as second language. this book helps you to score high in any verbal tests. Trust me!!
2,Nothing Special,"Although the title tells you just what to expect, it's nothing special for the price. You could get the same thing that this book offers by asking your questions at any online parenting board.Personally, I like to make sure that the people I ask advice from have the same philosophy of parenting. If I'm really in a jam, then I go to trusted experts.I suppose my main problem with this book is that it is so unfocused."
1,How to whitewash Catholic Identity.,"Hmm, let me preface my remarks by saying, I am not a Catholic.Mr. Vosko is a one-trick pony who's only idea of 'renovating' catholic churches is to remove the pews, dismantle the high altar, and create a 'theater in the round' setting. Instead of renovation it ought to be called wreckovation.One only need to look at the travesty of St. John's Cathedral in Milwaukee, WI.EDIT: Fixed the spelling of 'altar'. Thank you to Mr. Williamson."
2,"The Good, The Bad and the .....","On the plus side, this book has great photos of churches which Fr. Vosko has worked on. Also good are explanations of why certain Fr. Vosko leans toward including certain features in his architectual projects.On the minus side, it seems that there is an agenda that Fr. Vosko is promoting. What I have heard referred to as a Vatican III perspective, that the Catholic Church underwent a revolution in 1964 after Vatican II which needs to go even further.From the theological pew I which sit in I wonder if less sacred worship spaces lead to less sacred liturgy leading to less sacred people? We need to retake some ground which was holy and has become overly secular."
1,Ideological screaming,"At least several of these reviews were written by people who have not read the book and have submitted their reviews at the prompting of an ideological blog. Submitting this message requires that I rate the book - I have rated it only as 1 because I have not had an opportunity to hold the book in my hands, let alone read it. Very often these reviews are helpful and insightful - a level to which ideological screaming never rises."
2,To much hype,"After buying my Spector bass I decided to try these strings. I was not impressed at all, they almost sound wore out right out of the package. I will never buy these again. I'm going back to GHS until I find something else I like better. Perhaps they would sound better on a different brand bass (different wood). Maybe a solid maple body with neck thru."
4,Which edition to buy,"There are _three_ editions of this book. To get the right one, search for the ISBN number I list here:B-flat edition: 0634039202C edition: 0634039180E-flat edition: 0634039210Copy and paste the number into the search box, search for the number, and buy the book it matches."
4,"It's a B-flat edition, not C","The one with the green cover is B-flat, not C. If you're looking for the C edition, it has a blue cover.The webpage doesn't say anything about the key of the edition.Amazon sent me the wrong version (Bb) twice, and finally I asked for a refund."
1,Broke in 4 months,"I chose this toothbrush after my basic Oral B electric toothbrush finally wore down after a few years. Figured it was somehow 'better' since it was 'professional' and 'deluxe.' This toothbrush short-circuited after about 4 months. Water somehow gets into the battery (from the top or bottom, who knows), rendering it useless...until it dries, then it becomes schizophrenic and turns on at random times. It finally lost all ability to recharge....waste of money. Buy the basic one, they all use the same brush heads, so you get the same clean."
5,"Not magical, but pretty great","My dentist has hated me forever and my teeth are solidly yellow. I finally decided to try an electric toothbrush, and I decided to give this one a shot.There's a lot of reviews on various electric toothbrushes that suggest that it takes some time before your mouth accepts the vibrations (i.e. it can hurt a bit for a while), but I didn't experience this at all.It's certainly not magic. I've been using it for a few weeks and my teeth are still yellow, but it definitely feels like I'm washing them much more effectively. I've been using the ""whitening"" head, which feels like it has a rubberized cap in the center, between the bristles, which you can use to sit on your tooth like a ball-socket joint, allopermittingwing rotation."
2,Nothing like a Sonicare.,"I was using the Oral-B for years and just recently made the switch to the Sonicare.The Oral-B isn't as powerful, doesn't have as many options, the charge doesn't last as long, the handle gets disgusting and slimey, and the round brush doesn't cover much ground.Overall, I'm much more impressed with my Sonicare than I ever was with my Oral-B. My dentist agrees!"
2,Had to return because it didn't hold a charge,"I really liked this toothbrush until I discovered that it didn't hold a charge for more than 2 brushings. I was going to return it and exchange it for another one but found out that evidently others also had problems with it, so Amazon stopped selling it. I did order an Oral B Professional Care 1000, which is slightly less ""deluxe"", and, so far, am happy with it."
4,I'm Happy,"I'm giving this a 4 only because you will still need to floss if you want to really take care of your teeth. As far as brushing goes, it does a 5-star job and it has already (after 2 months) improved my gums.Someone said it felt too unsubstantial after having had a Sonicare. I, for one, am happy to have a lighter toothbrush do a better job than the heavy one (I admit, I had a really OLD Sonicare--the charger must have been over 10 years old at the least, maybe 15, and I was on my second handle--they could be different now).All in all, I'd recommend this highly. Hope it lives as long as the Sonicare brushes lived."
5,Oral B 8850 Professional Care Oral Care System,"This system with its soft brush attachment worked very well right after dental implant surgery which requires scrupulous cleaning 3x a day. There are several brush attachments, one for every need. I previously had a more expensive system but after two of them wore out quicker than they should have, I switched to this system and am delighted with it."
5,Deluxe is delightful,This toothbrush is the best electric we have owned. The duel head is amazing. I would purchase it again in a nano-second.
4,Great brush...doesn't do eVerYthinG it says it does...,"I love this toothbrush, but it doesn't stop when you push to hard. That was the reason that I got the more expensive one, so I am a little disappointed...But overall the brushing experience is great and my teeth feel cleaner than I could ever get them with a manual brush."
5,A Great Choice,"I decided to start using an electrice toothbrush again because I am a cancer survivor who has dental problems in part due to the radiation treatments. The round head is best for me as it reaches around all the teeth very well. The slower speed and softer bristles are beneficial too for a sensitive mouth and teeth. I find no problem in keeping it clean. After each use, remove the head, rinse and let stand by itself to dry. Also wipe the drive shaft to be sure it is free of any moisture. I am pleased with my choice."
4,pretty good toothbrush,"This toothbrush does quite a thorough job of tooth cleaning and breath freshening. I like it. Whether it's the best thing on the market, I have no idea. But, it does the job and I have no complaints."
4,Oral B 8850,"It works as advertised. Not all products can do that. Teeth feel cleaner and look whiter after several weeks of use. It works. Additional brushes are rather expensive, but I don't know yet how long they will last."
2,Good toothbrush - but....,Works as advertised - but this was purchased for use at home and travel and the charger is only 110V so it's no good for anywhere using 220/240V power. This should be noted on the product detail - and no excuse Braun for not having a multi-voltage charger :(
4,good toothbrush,"battery life is great, seems quite durable and well built. The variety of brushes was nice to try and pick which one works best for me."
3,buzz saw or toothbrush,"The first one only worked a few times before the button wouldn't turn it on. But amazon did a very swift return and this one is still working after a few weeks. This thing is really noisy! And the every 30 second notification of time is annoying. I don't need to know when 30 seconds has past. I like the 2 minute warning but every 30 seconds is too much. What it does is give you two little bursts of reduced speed. They should spend the money they spent on making it light up GREEN when fully charged to give you the option of shutting off or changing that. And really why do we need a green light? I brush then put back in the charger each time so its not like I need to know it is charged. I probably will try a different brand next time or look for one with less ""features"". It brushes well and has two brush speeds."
2,Not As Advertised,This is advertised as a 'deluxe' (DLX) version of this model with extra attachments. I did not receive the DLX version after TWO attempts. I have a feeling they don't actually have it in the warehouse.
5,Love this toothbrush.,A++ Best price found. The dentist always says how nice my teeth look. It's great for multiple users and easy to use.
3,Rowena California,"I have been using Oral B electric toothbrushes for about 15 or 20 years and am totally sold on them. However, this one has not been one of my favorites. The battery has never been very good at holding a charge for more than one or two days so it was not possible to take along on a trip without taking the charger. Additionally, the battery has now just died and I only bought this toothbrush 3 years ago in November."
2,Very disappointing!,"Purchased the Oral B Professional Care 3000 after reading reviews and their advertising that dentists recommend it. I had been using a Sonicaire Elite for over 5 years with great results, but that unit died and it was time for something new. Short story is I have returned the Oral B to the manufacturer under their great 60 Day Challenge policy. In my experience, the Sonicaire is a much more effective product for the money. Just received my new one from Amazon yesterday.Pros:-Bit less expensive than some Sonicaire models.-60 Day Challenge which enabled me to try and return it.Cons:-My wife and were both unpleasantly surprised at how much the units vibrated our heads while brushing. Certainly not inspiring us to brush more/longer.-Used the unit for about a month and had a dental cleaning. Hygienist said I had more stain on my teeth and gums were more raw than my previous checkup just 4 months before. Only change in habit was the Oral B toothbrush."
4,Good,My expectation was pretty high when I first saw the commercial...but the actual power of product isn't that great.
1,shoddy,I bought this via Amazon from DiscountsJungle. I used it for 3 weeks and it quit holding a charge. I wrote DiscountsJungle but more than a month had passed so they refused to take any action and told me to contact the maker. I haven't done that yet but a brand new product should last longer than 3 weeks.
1,"great product, but broke after 2 years","I just received what was supposed to be the Deluxe 8850 DLX Oral-B, but like another reviewer, received just the Professional Care 8850, which seems like the Deluxe version without the attachments (I hope that is the only difference). This apparently happened to other people too, so if the attachments are important to you, you may want to buy this elsewhere or risk several cycles of buy/return.Having said that, the one I got looks pretty much like an updated version of my old Oral-B brush that I am replacing (battery finally died after around 7-8 years)--and I loved that one so much I was desperate to get this new one when it died!"
1,Makes teeth sensitive. Use a good manual toothbrush.,"I bought a 2 pack of Braun electric brushes for me and my wife. After using it for a month I returned it. I usually do not return any item, least a personal item. But within 3 weeks I noticed that my teeth were more sensitive to cold water, etc. I did not want to use or pay for something that actually ruined my teeth. Looks like these brushes erode the enamel. Once eroded the enamel does not build back. Though I used these brushed around 1 year back, my teeth are still sensitive ever since I used them. The 2nd brush was for my wife and she had exactly the same experience as me.So I would advise you people out there. Keep it manual. More technology is not always good."
3,"Not thrilled, but partly our fault","We used this for our trip to Puerto Rico. Not the book's fault, but there was limited information on the country / territory due to the high number of countries crammed into the book. We were thinking it would be best to buy this book in case we went to any of the other destination.Great buy if you plan on backpacking or island hopping for a while, but I would invest in a location-specific guidebook (or use the free prints locally) to get my ""tourist information."""
3,Plot Terrific - Xlibris failed,"Sarge Ladnier's book was an excellent science fiction/survival yarn that was plagued with a lack of editing by the publisher. The story and characters earn at least 4 stars, yet the editing make it more difficult to read. The military edge was acurate and engaging as only a true warrior could depict. I read through it quickly and will be eagerly looking for Book 2!"
5,Really cool Insight to a Great Team,"this Book takes on the inside on what got the Lakers to there Championship Level.SHAQ&KOBE are Unstoppable Period as a Duo.this Team really is something else because they have done what no other Teams that have had Championship Runs have done&that is Turn it On&Off whenever they feel like it.in the Words of Blake Carrington this is a Dynasty.and Phil Jackson has Spreaded the Zen&Brought this Team together as One.Mad Props to SHAQ You are The Baddest,Kobe 5 Years from now who is gonna stop you? Rick Fox,D-Fish,Brian Shaw Robert (Big Bucket)Horry&the whole Crew. time for Number 3.then another Chapter continues next Year&so On."
5,It is filled with history & the story was captivating.,"I read this book after having just visited Plymouth, Massachussets, and studying about the Pilgrims. Even though the story is fiction it is woven into factual history and gives the reader an awesome look into the personalities and qualities of the people who lived this historical event. This book barely makes it back home before someone else asks to borrow it. I love history/fiction combinations and this is one of the best I have read."
5,Bluebird Box,I like this bluebird house - it is well constructed and the birds like it. Would buy another one if I had enough bluebirds for 2 houses. Bluebird Lady
2,Audubon Society approved this?,"This bluebird house does not have a predator guard on the front entrance hole. How can they claim this birdhouse is designed to the specifications of the National Audubon Society when it does not protect against predators, no vents, no drainage holes, etc? I'm sure it works fine, but surely not the best choice for homeowners with hungry cats, squirrels, and racoons nearby."
1,Are you fraking kidding me?,I heard about three seconds of each sample. (That was more than enough. Trust me.)Silly rhythm tracks forced to go along with beautiful music. The people who allowed this noise to be distributed to the general public should be fired.Will continue my quest for a hoped for lengthier version of The Wings elsewhere.
2,Love my club mixes,Oct. 17/07 hey guys I've just edited the colloboration on this song on my own and I enjoy it more now than ever...u my want to check out the other dance version on this song as done by Lifedance.....I live on club remixes. I used to love those extended ones but I grew tired of hearing next to nothig at the beginning and ending to these songs which left the good stuff in between. But I still love them but I prefer the radio edits. I wish they had done the same here which they usually include on cd singles. Would love the Tony Moran Rigg version first then the collaberation. Please edit these songs guys.
3,average stories,"the stories are well enough written and easily read, but many of them are too long. They are not interesting enough to make up for the length of time it takes to tell some of the stories."
4,Very pleased,Travel extensively. The holder is very impressive and has protected my passport on a few occassions. Immigration officials in non-US ports seem to take delight in spilling tea and coffee on my passport. The cover has protected it. Much better than the clear plastic covers.
3,Good,"This is good for the price ,the material is ok and it does the jobI received it before time so thats a plus"
3,"It's fine, nothing special. Works OK.","1. Not the greatest quality, but priced accordingly.2. Lock mechanism doesn't instill confidence. In fact there are two small pins that I suspect could be drilled out to render the lock useless??3. It will probably deter a kid looking for a joy ride. But, I would not use this for an expensive bike.4. Fits my 2007 Suzuki S40/Savage.5. Reminder cord is about 12"" too short.6. Made in china.7. I'll probably return it."
1,Interchangeable keys,"I previously owned the 2 inch version, but after one of the spare keys got stolen, I bought the 3 inch version. To my surprise my old keys were interchangeable with the new lock. I was very surprised since I have always considered Master Lock to be an excellent brand.Edit: I emailed a complaint to the company and got a reply stating this was just by coincidence and that each key is randomly generated by computer. They did not even care to ask where I got it from (in case it was a Master Lock ripoff) or did they care to get the locks back to investigate it further (I would have gladly mailed them to the company for free). This makes me think that this was not an uncommon ""coincidence""."
2,book,The routines in this book are soo random and lengthy a simpler more effective approach could be used. his navy seal book was better
1,Canned fitness in a book,"There is nothing out of the ordinary in this dime a dozen fitness book. Its basically ""canned fitness"" that Stew pushes in this one and its the usual advice you could have gotten from your local Y instructor. Stew discusses using machines in this book...a cardinal sin for any real fitness buff, especially an ex Navy SEAL.How about writing something original and unique next time? Instead of pushing more HIT (High Intensity Training) type workouts that are boring and just lead to injuries and burnout. Another thing I DISLIKED about this book is the emphasis on isolating muscles during strength training. This is classic bodybuilder type HIT stuff and doesnt build any real strength.If I could use one word to describe this book it would be this. BORING."
2,Disappointment,"I bought Stew's 1st book & it really helped me get back into shape. Eagerly, I bought this one but was disappointed. It's a re-hash of what is in the 1st book with cycling and weights thrown in helter-skelter. The workouts were difficult to follow.His 1st book was terrific. This one isn't."
4,Great Pictures and instructions to begin a fitness program,I am glad I purchased this book. I needed something to refresh my memory on calisthetics;free weights and some weight machine training. This book has great pictures although a few were out of sequence ( easy enough to see when you go by the written instructions) Where the book falls short is in the 52 week training program. It is very difficult to interpret what is meant...He calls some exercises by a different name than is shown on the picture. 1st day-regular crunch-nowhere to be found. There is no table of contents ( the first thing I had to make) so when he lists an exercise you have to hunt it down! He uses swimming as part of the program..not everyone has a pool; I would have liked a substitute.But the pictures have me hooked and I am well into training using this book as a guide.
3,Great!,"I've been getting back into working out and bought this book after constantly going to Stew Smith's website for more workouts.It's got an excellent variety, and is all planned out in terms of what to do when. The only problem I had was that some of the diagrams and notations for workouts and reps and whatnot were a bit confusing at first. But they make sense now.If you want to get a book about how to work out effectively, get this one. It's good value for the price.I wanted to give this 3.5 stars, but that isn't possible with Amazon's ranking system."
4,you will get in shape,"The workouts are tough, which is exactly what I wanted. The book could have been much better organized. You'll find yourself confused sometimes on what you're supposed to do - for example an exercise in the workout chart might have a different name in the explanation section. Like most any other routine, you'll get out of it what you put into it. You'll definately need additional material on nutrition. His chapter on that is very limited."
3,Just okay,"This is fine for light to moderate activity, but I recently started a retail job where I'm on my feet for several hours at a time and this doesn't really help. My ankles and back are still killing me by the end of my shift. I don't expect this to completely eliminate that pain, but it just doesn't seem to do much. It's a fairly thin insert, and there's really only some kind of gel-like support in the heel of it. No arch support or anything. If you need just a little more support for light activity, try it. Otherwise, you might need something a bit more robust. I recently have begun using a Powerstep insert and it works a bit better for me."
2,Not much of a difference,I don't feel much of a difference. My back pain is as painful as ever. I think this product is better suited for minor cases.
1,A nothing Insert. GET THE GEL!,I tried a pair of these In my running shoes which are not as comfortable as all trainers. The are light and flat shoes and Uncomfortable as a walking shoe.SO I tried these because they were the number 1 seller on Amazon. Boy was that a mistake.THEY ONLY HAVE A TINY CUSHION IN JUST THE HEEL! Which does not help my back or much of anything.I had to replace them with the gel Inserts and now I can tolerate my running shoes. The gel are the entire length of your foot and so comfortable!They are worth It for running shoes!I threw away this set of back pain relief.
1,Awful,"These are without a doubt the most evil devices to ever put in your shoes. Absolute torture. After four mile run, my feet and back were in distress to say the least. Not only lower back pain but middle back as well. Feet felt like they had run on large rocks all day. The manufacturer should take these off the market immediately.They do not even rate a one star."
2,pretty good,"Pretty good for most shoes and walking around.Well made, i think the birkenstock birko-sport insole is far better for around 60 bucks.Can't put a price on healthy feet and back. I am keeping both for different shoes."
1,Big Ripoff!,"These soles are nearly double the price of Profoot's, but unlike Dr. Scholl's Profoot actually works. Dr. Scholls puts all its money into fancy advertising and making the soles look colorful. Don't be fooled by the gimmicks. There product is little better than insoles that come with your shoes. In fact, these soles are a podiatrist's best friend, because that is where you will end up after wearing these shody soles!"
1,Poor customer service,"The product was fine, but the customer service is not! When I received this order, the insert in the box said that if it was a return, it had to be done within 7 days of the invoice date, and that I needed to call first. I received it on day 5, clearly not enough time to return it without incurring extra charges. Because my husband no longer had a need for the product, I would like to have sent it back unopened. When I called customer service and left a message for a return call. I never had a call back! I would not order from this company again."
5,Feels comfortable,This improves the comfort of my shoes. I have a high arch and this enables me to get thru the day without discomfort.
2,I did not like,are not as comfortable as I thought! no era lo que yo queria pense que eran mas comodas espero hagan lo que dice el producto .
3,Naaahh,"This orthotics are good, but not great. I was expecting a better finish in materias, especially in the surface fabrics.Good but not great.Any way, the price is fair for two pairs."
1,Mundane.... keep lookin,"This book is terrible. It has all the common conventions of a Dream dictionary book. I would have to say that out of all the mundane, garden-variety dream books out there, this one rates in the top 5..."
3,not for my application,This sensor is no good for controlling trolling speed.Works fine for faster speeds. I disagree that more words are needed.
4,Watch where you place it!,Worked fine once we lowered it a bit more. I have a pontoon boat and where the unit was mounted was not quite low enough so it got strange readings. Once it was positioned lower down so contact with the water was better it works great! It needs to be somewhat submerged on a pontoon boat.
5,Check your application guide!,"This is an excellent sensor, but I found out that those depthfinders listed as ""optional"" do not recognize the sensor and it will NOT work with those. Call or email Humminbird and verify that this sensor will work with your depthfinder before you order. I had just enough cable to reach my front depthfinder and it does work with it, though I preferred to have it hooked up to my back one."
3,Ok but I wouldn't recommend,"I keep financial and backup information on this disk and after months of use it now never wants to save when used in my laptop. I can open files but when I go to save it I get a screen saying I cannot save to that location, sometimes if I reboot it will work and sometimes if I take it out and put it back in the card will work, but not often. I don't have this problem with any other cards."
3,Not as described,"Although this is described as a 4GB, Class 6, 30MB/s card, I received a 4GB, Class 4, 15Mb/s card which is a slower and lower performance card (from ACE Electronic Store). For the low price, it wasn't worth the hassle of returning it but if it is important to you, keep that in mind when ordering"
1,Dead On Arrival = LOCK tab is missing,"DEAD on arrival....the memory lockin tab was missing, packing was good from the factory. Tried to obtain a replacement for 6 dollar SD MEMORY CARD....had to repaack, print out labels, deliver to a UPS DROPOFF .....THIS WOULD HAVE COST ME MORE THAN IT IS WORTH. SO I THREW OUT THE MEMORY CARD.....WHAT A WASTE OF MY TIME FOR A $6 DOLLAR ITEM."
5,Sandisk cards,I only use Sandisk cards in my old camera (Nikon D40) and in my new camera Nikon D3100. They are the very best cards and have never had any problems with them
2,Half Done,"Seemed a great deal? Order this set and get nice red crock to put items in. Ordered in mid-February, now March 11, and still no Crock. Due end of April. Ouch. I understand backorders, but forgot they might be making this stuff in some foreign country instead of the good old USA. I'll never order...""out of stock - be in shortly again"" items."
4,Great,Great product as a replacement for my current shaver head holder. It was a little high priced but in weighing the difference in price and having to decide on a new shaver I got this one. It works great
4,perfect,"The part was perfect for my machine, and was really an original oneThe deliver time was reasonable taking into account that had to be delivered in Spain."
4,Don't let the Ph.D discourage you,"As an independent consultant, I work with non-profit organizations to facilitate strategy and help them articulate their vision and values. Paul Light's ""spiral of sustainable excellence"" is a useful, practical tool for meeting these organizations ""where they are at ..."" and keeping staff and volunteers on the same page.Lou CartierCartier Outreach AssociatesGreeley, Colorado"
5,Very Adaptable Pin,"Simple product, simple installation. Secured the hitch plug quite nicely. I would be comfortable with this pin used with a trailer hitched to my truck. The price from Amazon was a no-brainer. Inexpensive and it works!"
3,Undersized with a few good features,"Terracotta (orangish clay)colored plastic plant saucer. Has a raised inner circle (4"" diameter in the ""10 inch"" saucer). This Terratray is undersized at 9 1/4 inches outside diameter. Due to tapered sides (which strengthens the side walls)the diameter of the interior bottom will only allow an 8 inch pot to fit. A 4"" inner circle on the bottom is elevated about 1/2"" to facilitate drainage and aeration under the pot. Six and seven inch pots are susceptible to slipping off this narrow ""mesa"" and tilting. A second, wider ring would prevent this. Described as ""All-weather Durability Terratray"" on the store receipt, hopefully, this indicates good resistance to freezing and against UV light deterioration."
4,Just what I wanted,"Goes well with the Fiskars 50010C 10-Inch Terrapot Taper Planter, Color Clay. Easy to throw away excess water for first time planters."
1,NOT 6 Inches!,This is 5 inches at its widest point and the base is significantly narrower than that. Beware! Not at all as advertised.
5,GOOD STUFF FOR CHRIS SQUIRE FANS,If you liked the yes albums The Ladder and Open Your Eyes and have an affinity for the Conspiracy project you will enjoy this DVD.aLL FANS OF the FIsh out Of Water cd will be very pleased to see the first two songs done in sequence here. That is worth the price of admission alone. The Camera work is a little tedious but hey adjust and you will be rewarded.
4,a must have for collectors of Jamaican tunes,"Two Kingston boys from childhood, reading the comics...tranforming into super hero DJs. This funny blend of tag team rapping and singing comes over some standard Jamaican rhythms like ""Throw Mi Corn"" and ""Stagalag"". Solgie mixing makes all the difference in the world. Check ""War Disease"", hot uno."
3,great,the game pocket dogs is brilliant it is so cool how you can collect furniture and decorate the house. i also love the fact ther are so many dogs to choose from and they all have extra cute photo albums
4,Fun But Sad,I like that the dogs are really cute and it is fun. But I had a dachshund named Star and she was taken away. Its kind of sad. That was the only thing I did not like.
4,Pocket Dogs fun game,"This game is quite fun and cute. First you pick out a dog then yo go to this house (which you can decorate) there are 3 mini games(which you can earn money by playing or jewels as there called) and you can chat with your dog you can tell it i'm fealing happy,sad,mad,u can sing 2 it and ask your fortune. But in this game the dog has(unfortunatly) to leave youThen you start over. It's more like a game than rasing a pet. If you get this game i hope you like it as much as I do"
5,Worth the buy.,"Our kids have been playing this for months, don't forget to feed your dogs each day, they do not grow up. Parents this is a great way to have a pet without the smell."
2,Somewhat dissappointing.,"My other dtr. has Nintendogs. We got this because it was for a GBA. She enjoyed it at first, but tired of it quickly."
4,An excellent summer read!,"Having little knowledge of the situation in Vietnam prior to the early seventies, Grey provides an interesting fictional account of many historical realities of the region. His blend of fiction and fact makes this story easy to follow and yet revealing in terms of the complex realities found in southeast Asia. A great summertime escape"
3,saigon by anthony grey,"This book was much to violent for me, and I couldn`t even get through it. I didn`t especially like the characters, and the book was very depressing"
5,A **S I M P L Y** D I V I N E L Y** I N S P I R E D BOOK !,"I won this little ""MIRACLE"" of a book in a raffle when I was 45 days sober. I can't tell you how many times the simple prayers have SAVED MY LIFE! I give the book to all my sponsees and anyone else that I feel needs a little love & guidance. One of my favorites, ""I Promise Myself"", has been my daily-mantra for years. This book, along with the Big Book & 12&12 are my MANUAL FOR LIFE! In a complicated & crazy world, this Prayer Book should be read by everyone! (just my opinion :-)"
4,Good DVI KVM Switch,"Other than some initial setup issues that tech support solved (using a wireless mouse and keyboard) I have been well pleased with this switch. I am running a Dell Optiplex GX270 (Windows XP Pro) and XPS430 (Win 7 Ultimate). The GX270 has a DVI output as does the XPS430 but my monitor only had a serial port or HDMI input. Got around this by purchasing a DVI to HDMI cable from another seller and running it from the switch to the monitor. Using the DVI output from the XPS430 allowed me to use it's HDMI output to my TV and I still get an excellent picture on the hi-def monitor. With the push of a button I can switch between these two machines and share a common monitor, mouse and keyboard. Adding a wired router allows me to share printers and other USB devices. Have had absolutely no problems with this switch at about 10 months use. If your application is similar to mine I highly recommend it."
2,Fails At Basic Functions,"This KVM unit has two buttons on the front like most, one for computer 1 and one for computer 2. When I first connected this unit to my two computers, it worked flawlessly for half a day. I was in KVM heaven, no special setup was needed. At the end of the day, however, computer 2 stopped responding to the keyboard and mouse. As of now, the monitor switching still works, but I am back to two keyboards and two mice. Also, StarTech support today confirmed with me by telephone that switching the cables does not fix the problem with ""computer 2"" not responding to mouse and keyboard, meaning the problem is with their unit in port 2. Whichever computer is connected to port 1 works fine. I am returning this unit for a refund. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is that it somewhat works, but it is close to the same as using no KVM."
1,Did'nt Work As Advertised!,"I purchased this to enable me to run two computers on one monitor, keyboard, and speakers which it was advertised to do. I seldom have a problem with setup or installation of new equipment or software however this wouldnt work for me. After several attempts I returned the item and Amazon gave me credit, however I was stuck with shipping both ways. I woulnt buy it again. Sorry to have to be negative about it."
2,"Not a ""How-To""","This DVD was/is a disappointment. As previous reviewers have said, ""this is a $29 ""pay to let me market my products to you"". Examples are a stretch for any photographer and generally won't be applicable to most photographic situations. Pick-up a free brochure on the SB-600 and SB-800; and spend your money elsewhere..."
1,DON'T BUY IT! I'll give you one for a frisbee!,"This video is absolutely worthless. It is a guy with SEVERAL Speedlites setup for different photo shoots. He doesn't explain his placement, the settings or anything. ""Basically I have a light here, here and here, and the Nikon Speedlite is so cool it does neat stuff."" That's about it.Absolutely a waste of money if you are looking for informative, how to or an explanation of the features. The author basically tells you to read the manual several times during the video.I really can't express how completely disappointed I am in this video and what a complete waste of money it is."
2,"advertisement, not a how-to","I felt like they were trying to sell the lighting system instead of actually educating you on how to use it. Just saying, ""See what you can do."" I could have used information on what settings they used or what equipment do you need to support the flashes, etc. Instead, I felt glad I bought the system but still don't know how to use it."
3,not bad but,shows how speed lights can be used but the second dvd (Nikon School presents A Hands-on Guide to Creative Lighting) is so much better in showing how to use the speed lights including 600-800-900-close-up lights etc.
4,Great inspiration,"On this dvd, Joe McNally shows you how he applies the Nikon advanced wireless system to different scenarios. He starts out shooting three artists in the desert of Nevada, and continues to shoot some students at a nearby high school. He does not go into great technical detail of how to set up the speedlights, but he will tell you why he puts speedlights where. In my opinion this dvd is best suited for photographers who have at least some knowledge of their flash system, and are looking for inspiration of how to use this.Even though I like this dvd, if you're just buying one, go for ""A Hands-on Guide to Creative Lighting""."
2,RIPOFF,"This is an infomercial and not much more. Nikon does themselves a disservice charging for this video as it leaves you with a sour feeling having spent $25-$30 on what should have been included with your Nikon camera (Tip to Nikon Marketing: include the video with the camera and a discount coupon for ""A Hands-on Guide to Creative Lighting"" and you'll see much more revenue from flash sales than you will with lame DVDs .That said, the Creative Lighting System itself is excellent, but get the instruction you are looking for from this DVD: ""Nikon School presents A Hands-on Guide to Creative Lighting"".After you've seen that one then head over to [...] to really delve into the possibilities. Save your money on ""Speed of Light"" though.Nikon, these are the kind of money grubbing gimmicks that erode brand equity over time. You can do better."
2,"Good Marketing Piece, but wanted more of Joe's Tips","I think that this video is mostly about marketing Nikon Speedlights and their superiority in changing scenarios, which I already own. I was hoping for more of the final portion of the DVD where Joe Discusses his perspectives on flash and how to use the system. If you can borrow this from someone else without buying it or checking it out at a library, I would advise doing that. If you have plenty of clams and want to accumulate everything Nikon then buy it for the final chapter of the DVD."
3,OK,"It was helpful to see some of the setups. I think the best was seeing McNally working with the subjects... his people skills... although there wasn't much of that. It was also reassuring seeing a pro push the small SB flashes to get some great results. Am convinced, the trick to being an effective out of the bag photographer is learning everything you can about your flash system and having 2-5 remote units."
2,Much like an infomercial,"I really like Joe McNally, and it was good to watch him work. But I own the strobes in this video and I got nothing from it. The stuff he covers about the lights seem to be designed to make you want to buy them (thus the infomercial remark). There is very little content about HOW to use the strobes or lighting guide lines. There's mostly comments like, there's a lot of sun behind the subject, so we need fill flash. OK, that's correct, but it's photo 101. I wish I could return this item in good faith. Save your money. Again, Joe is great, but there is no depth to what is presented here. Go buy Joe's book ""When it Clicks"". A far better place to spend your money. Nikon makes great lights, but does a lousy job of describing what you can do and how to do it.And visit the Strobist web site. That's the most magical place on the web for strobe lighting."
1,"Instructional? Yeah, right!","This is far from an instructional video. It is more like a documentary of, ""Look what I did?"" from this professional photographer. I'm busy enough with my own photography than to watch a video of someone with unlimited resources. Nikon you owe me a REAL instructional video."
1,shiny outside decay inside,"extremely POOR condition item.Externally the jumbo lighter is shiny.However the inside surfaces appear to have been suffering oxidation for an extended time. Most disconcerting is the rust around the hinge mechanism. The item is functional, but I advise you to NOT purchase one yourself.'quality' control FAILURE."
2,Not ON Trust,"Gunther Stevens (Steve) trusted no one, especially Triss Allardyce.His lack of trust started because he was attracted to Triss, and he felt he was coming on to him when she would try to talk to him. Although Triss only wanted to be his friend Steve took this as a come-on. And he hated her for it.After her husband Magnus dies Steve comes back to make sure Triss doesn't spend all the money Magnus has left to the school he started for furs and things.Steve sees Triss as a gold digger who didn't find enough gold and was disapointed by it.By the time Steve comes figures out he is wrong, the gap he created between Magnus and himself can't be mended, because Magnus is dead and buried.Steve turned out to be ok, but the other characters in the book supported Steve even when they knew he was mean to Triss, I didn't like that.Steve doesn't show the good side of his character until chapter 10."
5,Live at the Montreal Jazz Festival,"I saw these guys live at the Montreal Jazz Festival and they were brilliant! I hadn't heard them before, but heard the music and had to check it out. Their CD is very nice as well. It grooves but is also very inventive. There's not much electronic music out there that is this high quality, and the fact that they can do it live adds to their appeal. I can't wait to hear more!"
5,cosmic jazz-funk,"These guys are the future of music. Funky, mature tunes with a sleek urbane edge. Sophisticated harmonic concepts sit on (and inside of) a funky bottom filled with colorful percussion and huge warm bass lines."
3,blow dryer,"The dryer works very well, but the handle is not ""user friendly"" It is difficult to hold and I have pressed the buttons without meaning to while drying my hair."
2,Good while it lasts,"I bought this in October and by the end of December it completely stopped working. While it lasts it does its job well but only getting two months out of a product is unacceptable. In November it began overheating and would shut itself off, by the end of December it would not turn on at all. You are better off trying one of the other brands of this style dryer."
5,Revlon Ionic Hair Dryer,"This is a great hair dryer, it doesn't dry out your hair and it locks in the shine. I always keep an extra one on hand, but they last a long time."
4,Good!!!!,It meet with my needs.I would recommend it. The price was just right for me. I would order it again for a gift.
4,Good product at a Reasonable price.,This is a good product at a reasonable price. I bought it as a gift for my daughter and she like it a lot.
5,great product,This was a great product. I love it and use it everyday! My last one survived several years and this replacement is the excat same! Will easily buy it again!
2,Got an electrical burn from dryer,"I purchased this dryer in 2012, it worked great, it dryed the hair fast, but today 10/19/12 when I turned it on it litereally blew a hole through the cord, flames and sparks flew out, I got shocked and an electrical burn on my hand, this product needs a better cord."
5,AMAZING,"CRAZY FAST shipping. Wonderfully packaged and new condition! The product is self is terrific, it works stunningly. I had never used a Revlon dryer for my hair before. The only thing I would have liked to know is more information about the brush attachment. The brush attachment is not exactly as it is depicted in the picture. the bristles are not as close together, or as thick as it looks in the picture. Either way it works great."
3,Mixed Bag,"Webster, as usual, is in fine form, but the engineering is not great. As a result, the MJQ is muffled much of the time. To make matters worse, someone in the audience, perhaps a young teenager attending his or her first live performance, yells throughout the uptempo selections, ruining the listening experience. The only worthwhile portions of the CD are Webster's smoky ballads, particularly his renditions of ""You Are Too Beautiful"" and ""The Nearness of You."""
5,Two thumbs up!,"Been using this gel for last couple years under MD Forte name. Great spot treatment for my fair, sensitive skin. Doesn't totally dry out my skin like store bought brands, i.e. Clearasil. Has an extremely light, clean feel so about once a week I use it as a preventive over entire face."
3,Didn't fix everything,"I purchased this product because I have adult acne. I have been told to try glycolic acid products because they are less drying than those designed for teen acne. I like the product and it does seem to help some, but was not my cure.The product itself is fine if you are not trying to cure acne issues."
2,They're almost good,"The Solar e-clips lights look really great--for about three weeks--then they become very dim. The batteries just don't get enough energy from the way-too-small solar panel (and this is in Texas where there aren't that many cloudy days). It helps to turn the lights off in the daytime because although they are supposed to turn off by themselves based on the ambient light level, they still seem to use more electricity than if they are turned off with the switch. Turned off during the day, they almost last a whole night.The ""rock"" really needs to be able to be plugged in, or else have a solar panel about four times the current size, or have two ""rocks"" which can be swapped out every week or so.Installation is very easy providing you have installed your lawn edging the right way up."
4,SSX Blur,This game is very difficult to get used to but fun. I haven't played it a lot yet but still haven't done an Uber Trick. It may not be as easy to do those as previous games but once I really get the hang of it I'm sure I'll love it as much as I love SSX 3 and SSX On Tour.
3,Fun game,"The game has a small learning curve and is very fun to play. It is just like the other games of this brand and is a good game to own. Overall, not very challenging. I won 1st place in several events my first attempt playing the game. It has good graphs and good music. Controlling the uber tricks can sometimes be tricky."
1,"Please, an unlock code?","This game is HORRIBLE if you're interested in skiing or snowboarding simulation. You get about a minute of going downhill without having to compete in an overly stylized trick competition. I've seen other reviews that mention how great the long backcountry runs are, but you can't get to these without beating a zillion competitions, I'm guessing, because I certainly can't find them.All I want to do is ski or board down a hill--is that too much to ask? To make things worse, most of the game is ""locked,"" so you're stuck on just a few runs that you have to participate in competitions on.The controls are awkward at first but you get the hang of them in a bit. The tricks are senseless, though, and you get more points by waving the wand frantically than trying for a legitimate trick."
2,Great game series....poor controls,"I'm sad to report, as a big fan of the SSX series that the controls for this game ruin this game for me.... the tutorial was frustrating, and I didn't feel that the instructions were clear enough at all. I found the learning curve too steep for my attention span.....though, from reading others reviews - if you have the patience to stick it out - I'm sure it's a very fun game. So, in summary-SSX is a GREAT series of games, yet I wouldn't recommend this game to those without the time, patience, or attention span to invest in mastering the controls..."
2,Multiplayer is unacceptable,"If you enjoy the multiplayer aspect of SSX games of the past (before SSX ""On Tour"") you will be disappointed to know that SSX Blur has the same fatal design flaw that plagued SSX On Tour. When racing against a friend, if you get more than 300 feet ahead of your competition, the game automatically pulls your competitor forward to your position. This nullifies any value in having a multiplayer aspect to this game.If you are strictly interested in the single-player aspect of this game, you may enjoy what this game has to offer. However, if you enjoy multiplayer, the limitations of this game are frustrating and annoying. Buy SSX 3 instead."
2,Difficult to play,I know people like this game for its previous titles but this game is barely playable. Sometimes there is just no rhyme or reason for the controls. You can just wave the control around but you really have no idea what you are doing. Difficult at best to get your character to actually do what you want them to do.
2,SSX Blah,OK game as is but will improve dramatically if new version comes out in 2012 with the ability to use the wii board.
2,bad controls ruin an otherwise good game,"Let me begin by saying I loved SSX on other systems, namely Gamecube. This has bad, unresponsive controls. I like games that are easy to pick up & play-don't have too much time to spend learning controls. And, I have been gaming for years; but, the graphics are only ok."
4,Used Children's books,The book is a delightful story about horseshoe crabs. The quality of the book was very good for a used book and arrived quickly.
2,Feminist Gothic,"Usually an author has to achieve a certain level of competence and quality in a book before a publisher will buy it. But this one was so poorly written, and the author so unable to get me interested in the characters as people, that I stopped reading about halfway through, wondering how the book had ever made it past the publisher's desk. Only by skimming through to the end did I find out why: all the protagonist's troubles could evidentially be traced to her father's sexual abuse of her earlier in her life, which she apparently had repressed and only discovered later on (in the portion I hadn't read) though newly discovered ""repressed memories."" So it had been published as an ""important book"" because of this politically correct and trendy subject matter. Radical feminists who enjoy reading about how all men, especially fathers, are no better than dogs, may like this book. The rest will be bored."
2,"Waste of time, boring","Forced to read it for school. I couldn't make 5 pages a night before I fell asleep. Probably better for the females, especially soap opera watchers, but overall boring, and I'm so tired of reading descriptions of these Midwest Rednecks and their tractors!"
5,"Gripping, falters toward the end","A book with remarkably strong narrative as well as personal detail. A really satisfying alternative to book-writing's current focus on self-involved confessional novels.I loved it, possibly because I haven't read King Lear and was often shocked by the plot twists. One of the book's great strengths, in fact, is the way it makes a plot as harsh and punitive as Greek tragedy look like the kind of bad luck that could hit any modern family.Despite faltering around its mid-point, Acres is one of the best books I've read this year. Smiley's use of a passive, why-can't-everyone-just-get-on lead character as a lens through which to view a horrific tragedy is inspired. It gives her scope to examine the limited options of farm women, without making these ""digressions"" distract from a gripping central plot."
4,Touching Story of Real People with Real Problems,"I purchased this book despite the picture of Michelle Phiffer (sp?) on the cover. My expectation was that it would be sappy and romantic...but this book is gritty and real. It took me a while to get started, but then I could not put the book down. Smiley's description of the farming ""culture"" is vivid and her main character is alive and complex. I was fascinated by the family dynamics, which although sometimes a little ""unreal"", had traces of my own family experiences. I particularly enjoyed the ending...it made the book for me. Now - I wonder if seeing the movie will ruin the experience for me!"
4,Captivating,"I thought that Jane Smiley was able to captivate the reader by her characters and the way in which she conveyed those characters by the written word. She wrote in such a way that she brought the reader right into the story itself. You felt like you were looking over the shoulder of Ginny Cook while reading each word. I would highly recommend the book although I would not give it five stars because of the language. It was a bit melancholy at times, but that's life. Contrary to other customer reviewers, I thought the book was well written and well thought out. I had a difficult time putting this book down. It was a very good read."
3,Heavy Duty Reading,"My reading group recently chose this book as our September selection. Several of us walk our dogs together in the morning and each time we met, we would mention how depressing this book is. You actually couldn't put it down - but, you were haunted by the family depicted in this epic. During our group meeting, we had so many questions that were left unanswered. Why this? Why that? What were they thinking? Would I recommend this book? Maybe. If you need to feel that your family, no matter how dysfunctional, is normal - this is the book for you. Would I read it again? No. Am I glad I read it? Yes. Should you read it? That is something only you can determine."
4,A uniquely moving read.,"This is a book I feel that anyone can read and experience.Each character is good. . . bad. . . reprehensible. . .redeemable. . . human. Although some points within the storywere predictable, they did not detract from the suspense and horror Smiley has woven; they actually contribute to the interaction between author and reader. I could not put this book down. I cared about the characters, cared about the events, and cared about the setting. Forget ""big-city"" modern novels; this engrossing story about one rural family is just shocking enough to be true. You could know these people."
4,Poignant yet brutal look at family rivalries,"Thoughtful, well written & a pretty quick read, suitable forplane reading. The characters could be your neighbors...oryour own family. The plot has a few twists & turns whichcaptured my interest, yet isn't so complicated that chaptersneeded to be re-read between landings & take-offs."
5,A Modern Reworking of the King Lear Legend,"this novel is based on Shakespeare's 'King Lear'. Three farm women (sisters) play out a drama with their father, land, farm, families, sister pitted against sister, husband against wife, children against parents. We observe the nuances of communication, interpretation and the impact of will - - agendas shape meaning, shape action, and interpret motive.Incest impacts memory, emotion and life. Ultimately, incest can be destiny for we are forever in its shadow. The story is told from Ginny's vantage point as the middle daughter recreates her family's challenges, triumphs and tragedies.This is a remarkable book in its perspicacity,brilliance and terror. Smiley's language is rich and succinct at the same time. The scenes are revisited as though viewed from another direction. I was mesmerized throughout.This is a book I will reread several times. This is my second reading."
