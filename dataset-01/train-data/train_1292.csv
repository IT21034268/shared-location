2,The V Moda Bass is Cheap,"i Got these ear bugs because they are rated good in CNet.com But it curently not as they have rated...I use it on my Cowon Iaudio 7 and it sound so bad, it makes cliks cliks sound when playing some songs with high frequenzy or deep bass. Could be that i got a weak pair. Personaly I will just rate it a two star for what it does."
2,Sounds great -- but break way too often,"I have purchased at least six or seven of these -- for myself and for gifts. I have had three that failed. One I sent back for warranty replacement, the second was beyond the warranty, and for the most recent, I just don't want to go through the trouble. The first two, it seems perhaps ear wax got stuck in the bud, or else it just stopped working (I couldn't see anything, but could hear sound from the back of the earphone). No amount of cleaning would fix it. For the third, the jack seems to be going.Obviously, I love the sound and fit of these things. But they aren't cheap, and the failure rate is far too high."
1,These May Be Cool At First...,"but after a 4-6 weeks, they stop working. At least, mine did. I was horribly careful with these headphones after reading the reviews on how sensitive they could be, but that didn't stop me waking up one morning to find the left ear piece not working :| Ultimately, a waste of money. After these, I bought a $1.97 pair from walmart. They just stopped working the other day. The sound wasn't as great, but it was pretty nice, and they kept working for the same amount of time. Don't buy these, they're cheap plastic. The only thing the 20 dollars pays for is the noise cancellation, which work well, for the month the headphones work :P"
4,They sound like they're worth three times the price,"My toddler son kept chewing off the foam from my cheap Sony earbuds (Sony MDR-E828LP Fontopia Earbuds with Winding Case) so I decided to step up just a little bit. Based on price and reviews, I bought these earbuds along with a pair ofSennheiser CX300-B Earbuds (Black). In a direct comparison, I prefer the Sennheisers because they sound just a little crisper. Even so, I'm using the V-MODAs right this minute and I'm very pleased with them. They fit my ears right out of the package, frequency response is good, the bass is great, and they seriously block outside noises (which could be a good or bad thing, what with a wife and child in the house). I would expect to pay more for earbuds of this quality; consider me very satisfied with my purchase."
4,Great earphones for the price!,"I purchased these earbuds based on reviews from Amazon and CNET and I was not disappointed. Less than a year ago I had purchased a higher-end earbud for just over $100 and found them to produce only marginally better than the V-MODA Bass Freq earbuds, and the more expensive pair did not even last a year.The bass produced is actually quite good, although the highs did not seem quite as crisp.Once I found the correct size fittings for my ears (I had to go with the smallest size) they blocked out a surprising amount of background noise.Overall, a great earphone at an excellent value!"
5,The Best EarBuds for the Money,"I tried several different earbuds in the $20-25 range and these are by FAR the best. I listen to a lot of bass heavy tunes and the other just didn't cut it when it came to bass, they would all drowned out or go fuzzy. These are crystal clear and they are also the most comfortable too!"
5,Here comes the boom !!!,"These are really nice earphones for the price. I use this on my iPod, the iPod earphones are OK, but I wanted to upgrade. The goal was to get a nice pair of headphones without dropping a lot of cheddar. I did my research and found these on CNet reviews.These really are a great pair of earphones. It is really amazing the sound that is produced with these earphones. Also it comes with different sized inserts for a snug fit. They will not fall out of you ear while working out.Really a great pair of earphones. Highly recommend it."
2,"Cheap, but good ... but cheap.","Plus: They don't cost too much, and they give better sound quality than typical earbud headphones - specifically, they give a full bass response where typical earbuds (and laptop speakers!) give almost nothing. If all your music sounds like crap, well, this'll fix it.Minus: I bought these headphones in late November, and by now, mid-February, they've started crapping out. In both earphones.Conclusion: If you don't mind buying replacements all the time, they're superb. Otherwise, get something else."
2,Too much Bass and Very Low on Treble,These earphones are good for the price but they are too high on Bass and you end up missing out on a lot of Low End Tones. The headphones donot have Rich Sound. This is a good option for Bass enthusiasts.The sound amplification in earphones is too high and might be uncomfortable for longer use. I am a kind of a person who uses earphones 4-5 hours a day and these earphones are not a good option for me.
4,Good Quality,"Sound Quality was good. I prefer devices that are over the ear. These designs tend to fall out of my ears as did this pair.Unfortunately, I stepped on mine the 2nd day, so I didn't get a lot of use/experience with them."
3,V-MODA Bass Freq Earbuds - Bling Bling Black,"These ear pnones were one of the best earphone for a cheap price no doubt but i had several problems with them, for one thing the ear bud size didn't fit that well even the smallet size didn't stay in my ear too long. So it get annoying having to put them back in your ear every five -three min!! My major concern though was the ear phone jack came off when i unplugged it from my laptop, it was a total bummer only after two month this happened and i tried to get a hold of the seller for the warranty he didn't reply so i would not recomend buy it if the seller sucks!! Or dont buy at all!!"
3,good but not great,These are good earbuds but not the bass I was hoping for. I like them. They are better than the earbuds my ipod came with but they really aren't what I would call bass heavy. They are very comfortable but have a tendency to fall out while I am running. I like them and they deserve three stars but i wouldn't buy them again.
4,V-MODA BASS FREQ Earbuds,"The earbuds reproduce the highs and lows very well. I like the design and the way they fit my ear, however they may not be suitable for vigorous excercise."
1,These headphones sound terrible!,"They are call ""Bass freq"", but they have no bass! They really have no frequency range on either end of the spectrum! I am assuming that there is something wrong with these. I contacted Ace Photo and Digital (Amazon's merchant rep for this product) to return them. They told me that I could not return opened merchandise...obviously I could not have listened to the earbuds without opening them! I emailed V-Moda and they will send me a new pair as soon as they receive the damaged pair and my proof-of-purchase. I hope the new ones sound as good as advertised!"
2,No way these headphones are good...,"I must review this product step by step, just like is shown in the product details, I also have to say that I shuold look for reviews in cnet.com. I do regret I payed such money, they sound exactly like the cheap low quality you recieve in national flights...Deep yet precise bass - ZERO BASSPassive noise isolation reduces ambient noise without batteries - ZERO NOISE ISOLATIONV-MASQUE driver delivers warm mids and crisp highs - THEY ARE NOT THAT CLEAR REGARDS SOUNDBLISS silicon tips in three sizes for maximum comfort - NO THAT COMFORTABLEAward-winning design in an array of colors - IRRELEVANT BECAUSE I CONSIDER MOST IMPORTANT THE PERFORMANCE"
2,Wrong colour earbuds delivered,The colour of the earbuds that were delivered to me is vastly different from what is being pictured. Though the sticker tag says that it is 'Rouge red' the actual colour name on the package itself said 'rocker red'. It is disappointing that such a mistake was made.
1,Very little bass,"I selected these earphones because others had said the bass was overwhelming. I couldn't hear it--at all. Maybe I got a defective pair, but the ones I received just produced no bass. Also, I was very careful to make sure that I was using the correct size ear pieces and getting a good seal. I usually listen to classical music and symphonic music without bass isn't listenable. So, I had to return the earphones."
3,"Better options, even at this price","Even at this price-point ($15), there are better options out there. These headphones certainly focus on bass, so you lose out on all higher tones, but even the lows lack fullness. Think cheap subs rattling in the trunk of a teenager's car. The fit is fine, as long a you're not moving around too much. Otherwise, they're not going to stay put."
1,i want my money back!!,"i saw these back when they were more expensive, i thought spending a bit more than those 9.99 ear phones will be worth it in the long run...but they didnt last not even a month!!...they worked fine for about three weeks, then i tried to sleep with them, and they kept falling out..the sound is ok, it brags about bass, but you cant seriously hear any bass, i listen to dub, reggae and rap, in order to hear the bass, you literally have to shove the ear bud as far as possible, you are basically raping your own ear...they finally broke two days ago, all of a sudden the sound went choppy in one ear until it was gone...less than an hour later the other ear bud died, it had something to do with the cable, right where it connects to my mp3, every time i moved it around i just kept hearing choppiness...over priced, weak sound,vmoda?...im going to buy some better electronics with better known brands that i have come to trust in the past.."
4,Pretty Good,"For $20, this is a pretty good deal. It does an excellent job of sealing out noises. If you like loud, boomy bass, you will love the sound of the Bass Freqs. The bass is too artificial for my tastes. The OEM iPod headphones offer better mid-high definition. Overall, I'm satisfied, but only because of the low price."
4,Decent set of Earbuds,"I bought these a week ago and at first was a little disappointed with the sound. They sounded very tinny.... I lot of treble and no bass. I had read several reviews that mentioned ""burning them in"". So I let them play for about 10 hours and they sounded better. As I use them they keep getting better. So if you get these make sure you give them time to burn-in. Hope this helps!"
2,Pass if you are a runner...,"My earphones that came w/ my ipod died so I researched earbuds online, after reading many favorable reviews I purchased them.Great for walking around, but not so great when running on treadmill / outside - they constantly fall out."
2,Loud and Cheap,"A month ago beforq buying these headphones I bought Sennhesier HD448, nothing to do with this type of headphones, they are around-ear and they hang on your head, the point I wanna reach saying this is that the Sennhesier didn't had enough bass for my likeness, but they had a beautiful detailed sound, after owning them for 2 months I wanted something bassy to hear those Eminem songs which I love and sound great with a nice pair of bass headphones, which my Sennheiser's weren't. So I decided to try these because they just have Bass on theor name. They arrived late and after trying them with different songs I regret of buying these headphones, they sound so loud and cheap, I couldn't enjoy any music with them. I deffinitely don't reccomend these at all. A pair of cheap headphones which sound really great were Sony Mdr-Ed12Lp, they are cheaper and you can enjoy any kind of music with them."
4,"Fairly good sound, fitting is kind of weird","When I first tried these on they fit and sounded great. However, after wearing them for a bit, the buds slowly slide out of my ears and I find myself having to reposition them constantly. The sound quality isn't the most amazing thing in the world, but it's pretty decent for the price. And the nifty little cord keeper that comes with it is a nice idea and all, but leaves the cord all spiraled and kinked when I unwrap it and put them back on."
2,v-moda versus the bose tri pprt and other over the ear designs,"PRO: small, good build quality, cheapCON: poor sound quality, poor fit in earOVERALL: With sound comparable to the standard iPod ear buds, why buy these.I recently purchased these headphones to use in addition to my Bose Triport headphones with my iPod. I thought the smaller form factor would make them more attractive for when I traveled.I was wrong. The sound quality is not comparable. The Bose headphones are significantly better, even in terms of bass, which was surprising considering all the bass hype and reviews. The comfort is also not comparable. The Bose headphones are way more comfortable. This may be subjective, because all of the included ear pieces appear to large for my ears, and thus they fit uncomfortably, but I'm not sure.Overall, decent headphone, but no better than the ones included with my iPod."
1,Pick something else - bad sound and bad fit,"Very disappointed in these earbuds. Compared to the Apple buds I got with the Shuffle, these are very ""tinny"", lacking any bass at all. additionally, even the larger ear piece keeps falling out of my ears when I work out."
1,ear buds,We bought these (highly rated) to have a better quality than the ones that came with the Sansa MP3 (before we tried them) and they were actually much worse. Not very good sound @ all. We sent them back and stuck with the earbuds that came with it.
5,Great value-excellent quality,"I'm absolutely in love with these earbuds, the sound quality they produce is very high and they cancel out sound in your environment (even in the lab I work in which has very noisy vacuum pump). Also the customer service from the factory was great when I had a problem with the fittings, they sent me new ones for free within 2 days! At $30.00 it's hard to go wrong with these earbuds."
3,"Decent earphones, but there are better alternatives for the price","Before I bought these earphones, I used the earphones that came with my Zune 80gb,Zune Premium Headphones v2, which were surprisingly good. They had very good sound isolation and sound quality, but after a few good years, the wire connecting them to the audio jack eventually wore out.I then set out to find comparable earphones in terms of price and features and after much research, I came across these. Most of the reviews were nothing but positive, saying that they had great bass and everything, just as the product name would entail. This was not the case, at least as far as what I am used to. The bass was lacking and the mids and highs sounded very mediocre. They also did not seem to block out as much sound as I was expecting, but in the end they were not expensive anyways.If you can find the Zune earphones for a similar price, I would say go for those or something else because these are not anything special."
4,V-Moda earbuds,"Have had a pair of these for 3 years that still feel and sound great, just needed a second pair."
3,V-MODA Bass Freq Earbuds (Rouge Red),Received these on 10th april 2011. The sound quality is very good especially the bass. However after 2 months exactly the left ear piece stopped functioning. Not durable at all.
3,Not Bad,"Good sound quality. They definitely are ""bass driven"" ear buds. But, next time around I'm going to see what else is on the market."
2,Poor Quality,"These have nice bass, somewhat weak treble and poor midrange. I still liked them for a few months. Then, of all the earphones I've had over the years (many), the sound on the left earpiece became erratic (slight movement of wires caused it to cut out). These are extrememly poorly made. I handle everything with great care and have had other earphones for 10 years and they are still fine. I got these because of the reviews and because you really don't have to insert them far or turn them up to hear full sound. However, the lousy wire quality ruins my rating. Avoid."
1,Junk,"I bought these earbuds about 6 months ago, and they broke already. Pretty useless for as much as they cost."
2,"Good sound, but too fragile","I really liked the sound of these; however, one of the wires apparently broke at the plug end within two months of use under normal, everyday conditions. Unfortunately, by then I couldn't find the sales receipt. A real disappointment!"
2,Don't waste your money on these!,I bought these earbuds on the favorable reviews they received. They make my music and audio books sound weak and far away. The original earbuds that came with my Zune blow these away! Don't waste your money on these. I should have shopped some where that I could have tried them out first and saved myself some money.
1,Disappointed,"These head phones have ear pieces that easily fall apart. Instead of fitting comfortably in the ear, the ear buds actually block the sound and are uncomfortable. I am buying new ones because these are so lousy."
2,One works great,"Trust me when i say this, do not buy these headphones. They work fantastically until one earbud stops playing music. I dont know if its because i put them in my pocket or not. I know when people read bad reviews of a product they want and just think that it wont happen to you. It has happened to two sets of the same headphones. Do not buy them"
1,extremely fragile and flimsy,"i bought this back in 2008, then after 5 months only the left side worked. so i sent it in and got another one, same thing happened after another 6 months. still, i assumed i just had bad luck with defective products cuz the reviews were so good. so i ordered another pair, they too broke down after 9 months with only one earbud working, so i sent it in under the warranty and it just broke again. i will NEVER buy from VMODA again, it is the most UNDURABLE headphone i have ever owned."
2,Broken six times,"While the sound was good for it's price, I will never buy this again. All 6 pairs (or even more, I lost track) have either completely broken, got sound muffled, or one piece does not emit sound. I bought one, that broke, warranty covered it, it broke again. I bought a 3rd one, broke, 4th one broke, warranted 5th one broke, then after another month my 6th one broke. I'm tired of spending $30 every month. I regret buying this and now I have moved on to the utterly amazing Klipsch Image S4s, which sounds on par with Shure SE310 and many others worth 3 times its $80 dollar value. While it may seem expensive, it is actually a lot cheaper since it will last you longer, compared to my 6 pairs which lasted me about 8 months for about $140 + $60 warranty covered ones. Honestly, just avoid these."
2,"Bass heavy, muddy mids and highs","I've been looking for a pair of replacement earbuds for my Palm Pre, and my friend let me listen to his pair of V-Moda Bass Freq buds.I could instantly tell that they put all of their effort into driving bass. Unfortunately, guitar and vocals just sounded muffled & muddy - more than my stock buds. Though they didn't have all of the crackling/clipping of my current buds at higher volume, they didn't sound anywhere as good as my Sennheiser PX 200 or HD 497 cans which have a much better frequency response (but no portability).You can't expect much for the price, but they aren't as great as everybody seems to claim unless all you listen to is drum-n-bass. I'll be looking for another alternative model, where hopefully they focus on fidelity instead of bass."
2,Cheap shoddy construction,"I bought the Bling-bling Black. What can I say? I love the sound. Crisp clear highs and midrange and the low deep rich bass. The construction? HATED IT!! Where the cord comes out of the plug is the major weak spot and is not compatible with an active lifestyle. The connection where the plug meets the cord allows for too much movement at the joint hense the wire connection breaks inside the insulation. Results either the right or left plug stops working or both. In my case it was always the right plug. This is my 5th pair of headphones in less than a year. Every single pair died within a few months of purchase. You'd think for the price you pay for them, there'd be sturdier concstruction an active lifestyle. and hold up to V-Moda really needs to rethink this design flaw. Overall my rating is 5 stars for sound and 2 for construction."
2,Great...While they lasted,"These are a great sounding earbuds! The sound is incredible, but they lasted only a week! Yes, they no longer work! I am so disappointed that these have such poor quality workmanship that many of us are having to return them. I have had mine more than thirty days, so I don't know if I can exchange them. I am going to buy a different brand if I am not able to replace these."
2,good bass... while it lasted,"Believe the other reviewers about the cheap cord. Mine lasted 3 months before the inside wire became loose, right where the it goes into the plug.It's a shame they didn't improve the build quality, the bass was pretty awesome."
2,Should have lasted longer!,"Pro: Good sound. They blocked out train noise wellCons:1. Even with the smallest size, the earbuds were always just a little too big, had to keep securing them back in my ear.2. I know that if companies made products that lasted forever they wouldn't make as much money, but they only lasted a year. 1st the left one went, then a week later the right one was done."
2,Muddy,"Too much bass. Muddy mid's, had to send back. Amazon returned without a hitch, I love Amazon. Decided to get Sony's NWZ-S615FBLK MP3 player instead. The supplied ear buds blew me away..."
5,Superb Full-Bass Headphones,"When my trusty Sony bass-boosting headphones broke after 3 years, I was in search of a new pair. These moderately priced earbuds were just what I was looking for! The 3 sizes of ear piece ensure a secure fit, adding to the wonderful ambient noise reduction. Most importantly, the sound quality does not disappoint!The only minor complaint I have is the ""case"" that comes with the headphones, which is nothing more than a rubber V for you to wrap your wires around. If you plan on transporting these, think about buying a small protective box as well."
4,these earbuds give me what I want,"am looking for strong bass earbuds and these earbuds just give me what I want. The bass is amazing, like everyone else mentioned. I mostly listening to Rock, so I dont care about mids or highs, and am not a sound expert at all. I think you hardly find better earbuds with the same price ( I got this for 19.95$) since I did a lot research already. They also do good job cancelling noise, I cant even hear what Im saying when music is played.Overal, these are much better than the ipod stock earphones, which I wont look at again. Am happy with them btw."
1,Fragile,"The sound is great, but it's just too fragile to use lets say.. while moving. I bought two pairs of the V-Moda Freqs and gave one to my friend and used one myself. The one I used lost sound in the left ear in less than 6 days of use. My friend used his at his home and the right side just fell apart, although he was able to put it back together, the quality of the build just doesn't justify the price tag. My Older pair of JVC Marshmellows took some actual beatings and still works as fine as the day I opened it, These won't even last if you take good care of them."
1,Loss of Sound,These appeared to be the best headphones I had ever purchased for the first 2 months. After about 2 months the headphones lost most of the sound. Sometimes I could only hear the music and sometimes I would only hear the singer. It sounded terrible. This was the worst purchase of my life. I winded up just taking the buds off of them and using it with my sony headphones. DO NOT BUY THESE HEADPHONES THEY DO NOT WORK!!!!!!!!
2,"Nice, but short-lived","I bought these headphones a few months ago, and until recently, I have been very pleased with them. However, over the past couple of weeks, the sound has been spotty in the right ear. This afternoon the sound shut off completely in the right ear. So while these are fairly nice headphones (and moderately priced to boot), they only lasted me a few months so I do not recommend them to others."
2,Worth about $20,"I am underwhelmed. There is bass to this, yes. But that is not nearly all that is required for high quality sound. These are comparable to any other $19 set found at the local discount store. I can't explain all the raves--""the emperor has no clothes"" maybe? The marketing of these is very appealing, so maybe people are hearing what they expect to hear, rather than what they actually hear. If you are after a $20 set, that is what you will get with these. And I'm not complaining--it would be crazy to complain that a set of headphones that cost $20 is only worth $20. But I am not raving either."
3,Good Bang for the Buck but not for long,"These things sound very good, especially for the money but they don't last very long. I'm back here buying another set of earbuds because these died on me. About 3.5 months after I bought them, I needed to Crazy Glue one side back together because it was coming apart. Now (5 months after purchase) there is a short in the cable and the left side keeps cutting in and out.Shame they don't last longer as they seemed like a good bargain at the time and I was extremely happy when I first listened to them. I am not particularly rough on them...in fact I'm pretty careful. My previous SONY earbuds lasted much longer but are more expensive... I guess for a reason..."
2,"good sound, but eventually break after couple months","I am a heavy ipod listener and I use my headphones constantly. I like these headphones a lot because the sound is good. But after a just a few months the sound inevitably goes out on one side due to poor wiring. I am about to go on my fourth pair. I have already sent one pair back to the manufacturer, which they replaced, however the same thing is starting to happen again, and it's only been a couple months. Familiar with the problem, I have been extra careful to be gentle with the wire when using it. But alas, I can already hear the sound starting to go out in one ear. It's only a matter of time now before the sound cuts out altogether. This is really annoying because I think the sound quality is great, but I dont want to have to keep sending them back. For 30 bucks they should last a lot longer than 3-4 months. The 10 dollar sony's (MDR-W08L Headphones) I used to buy would last at least 6 months to a year before the same thing happened."
2,"If you're picky about sound quality, skip these.","True to the name, the low-end bass response is incredible with these buds. Sadly, the midbass is loud but not crisp, and the claim of ""warm mids and crisp highs"" is a joke. The Sennheiser MX400's have much better balance and provide superior SQ if you bump the bass a couple notches. Because of the ""earplug"" effect, the heavy bass and the too-bright highs, these might be okay for a plane ride, but the overall sound quality doesn't make the cut for general listening."
1,DO NOT BUY - all bass and nothing else,Do not buy these headphones. It's got tremendous bass but nothing else redeemable. The mids and highs are filled with distortion. I very much regret this purchase.
1,No competition: worst sound ever!,"Okay... maybe if all you listen to is hip-hop or techno, you want a headphone that delivers nothing but loud, thuddy bass. On the other hand, if you are interested in hearing any detail, any mids, or any kind of balance avoid these phones. Tried using all the different plugs (just in case I was missing something), tried adjusting the EQ (just in case...), tried all different kinds of music (just in case...) Nothing doing, returned them the next day. Avoid, avoid, avoid!"
2,Too Fragile,"I've just tossed my second pair of these earbuds in the trash. Both of them lasted less than 2 months before one of the channels started dropping out. The wiring is just too flimsy to hold up to normal wear and tear. They sound fine and they do a good job of keeping out ambient noise, they are just too fragile for an average user."
5,WoW!!!,"This is the best V-Moda earbuds out of the whole lineup. The price was just under $30 and the sound was like OMG when i first plug it into my ears! I first bought the more expensive V-Moda chrome edition which cost almost 70 dollars and i thought it had to be the best because of the price. But man, was I wrong! the look of the chrome edition was awesome but the sound was just horrible. My brother bought this one like a week later and when i tested on the same Ipod, I was blasted out of mind! I was thinking to myself, what in the world was V-Moda thinking, a $60 dollar earbud that can't even compare to its lower priced $30 earbud! The sound was great, the bass was high and clear, the treble was high enough but didn't drill my ears. Then I did some research also and I found that the folks at Cnet gave this little earbud an editor choice and was rated best bang for your dollars! Get this if you are looking for earbuds around $30, you won't regret it."
2,Poor Sound.,These things sound like crap. Tried all kinds of settings on my EQ. Got them hooked to a Sansa Clip. They're loud; but sound like crap.
4,Awsome headphones....while they last,These are probably the best earphones out right now but they only last a month before they break.
4,"Bling Bling...""NO"".. Working Head Set ...""YES""","I guess I was one of the lucky ones that did not get a defective product .. for $20 I think they are worth every penny... Highs, lows, mediums and bass was all good. Do not expect to get anything spectacular in design... they are just plain headsets with GREAT sound!!"
3,"sound was good, broke after two months!!","These had great sound and were very comfortable due to their exchangeable earbud sizes, but they stopped working after two months. Definitely not going to pay $20 every two months to replace them!"
4,Best bass earbuds,These earbuds have the best bass reponse I have been able to find. I have tried 4 or 5 different brands and while some have better clarity (treble) these have by far the best bass response. I only wish they made this same model with tangle resistant cords or if they could keep the bass response while improving the high end a bit.
3,Get them if cheap,"These are fairly flimsy buds. Bass is uncomfortably emphasized, so ignore these without an equalizer to tweak them. Otherwise, the power consumption is amazing (I get more hours of play out of these than other headsets) and once massaged, the tone is pleasant. Gels are comfy once you figure out that you shouldn't press them completely in canal-- suction gets quite disturbing. Partially set in (just until a seal is made) and you're set to go for hours. Keep misplacing the small cord wrapper-- should not be so generic looking. There are better out there at regular price, but if cheap they can't be beat."
2,Still searching,I've been on a quest to find the perfect sounding earbuds. Needless to say I'm still searching. The best I've found so far are the Sony DRE10IP.
2,There is somewhat bass in this earbud. but high Freq. is crappy,"Yes, the bass covers very low frequency to 8 Hz. But I am not only listening to bass when I am listening to music, and am feeling the higher frequency sound is not good at all. I have a Siberia by Icemat for comparison. The bass part are almost of the same performance. But the sound at higher frequency of this earbud is kind of crappy. Also, don't expect too much from sound-isolation. I can hear clearly the other sound outside. Overall, I would not recommend this earbud anyway for its $30 price. It's not better than the original ipod earbud."
5,Best for the Price - CNET agrees,"These are excellent earbuds for the price you pay - $30. Amazon even shipped it for free. It is a little heavy on Bass. But if your mp3 player has an equalizer, there is no problem once you adjust the bass on the equalizer. For $30, you cannot go wrong. CNET gives this produt a 8.0 rating."
4,Better than expected....,"I was very impressed with these ear buds. After reading the review of them on CNET, I went forward about purchasing them with not expecting too much. After I received them, I was quite impressed. The overall quality of audio reproduction is very good considering the price and really produces good low bass. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants an affordable yet quality ear buds."
4,Nice pair,Nice product. Good Quality. Only issue I face is its cable gets entangeled very easily. Bass is really good - no need to boost it using ur equalizer.
4,Good sound. Occasionally fall out while running.,"I think these produce good sound. At least better than the earbuds that had come with my iPod. However, sometimes they slip out of my ears while jogging. I wonder if they slip due to moisture or if they slip because of the jarring type motion. These earbuds came with different size rubber buds so maybe I'll try a bigger size.Although I think they were a bit over priced for the quality, overall I like them."
1,Where are the highs and mids?,"First, let me say that these do sound immensely better than the stock earbuds that came with my Zen, and they do a great job at noise isolation. To my ears, however, they are quite bass-heavy, with the bass being indistinct at that. As much as I wanted to like them, I have found myself wanting to hear more of my music and shall be looking into other IEMs to suit."
1,Save Your Money,"With a name like ""Bass Frequency"" one would expect a noticeable bass presence, right? Forget it. The sound through this headset is thin and very, very unimpressive. Save your money."
3,Good sound. Shotty construction.,"Pros:- Good sound quality, better than the JVC Marshmallows. Very reasonable for low price.- Pretty design.- Comfortable ear pieces.Cons:- Awful, cheap, breakable construction. I've had three break in the last several months.- Wire tangles easily.They sound great, and I really like the design. But they just break too easily. It winds up costing more to replace these all the time than to buy a nice, well-made one in the first place. The ear piece falls apart if any stress it placed on it, even just taking it out of my ears at one point. It feels like it's made of a really cheap plastic, like dollar store quality."
2,I will wish it last a little more than a couple of months,"I bought a pair of these for my mp3 player sound is really nice for the price, if you do not want to spend more than $200 for a headphone, these looks like a good alternative, so i bought another pair. The headphone itself has no issues the real issue is the plug, it poorly made my first pair the plug was literally pulled off the cable, just regular use for a couple of months. I was really disappointed, even cheaper Jvc of Philips are better build that these. I wrote a complain to the company, never got an answer. so I started to use my next pair, i was very careful this time, which was a little annoying for me. this time after 6 months it started to get no sound from left speaker, and a week after no sound at all in both speakers. when i move the plug i can get some noise, that make me believe it is the plug or the cable again. good headphones but do no buy it unleash you want a headphone for a couple of months and trow it away after that."
4,"Good bass, but don't pay too much","I purchased these for around 10$, for that price this is a decent buy. Any cheaper and i'd even say a good deal. The bass is somewhat punchy but can be overwhelming for most music genres (techno/rap sounds brilliant). However the mids are pretty poor and the highs sound a little tinny. Also, the build quality of the cable is poor. These have the thinnest cables I have ever seen for earbuds, some serious longevity concerns there. All in all, if you can get em for around 10$ you really cant do any better these buds."
3,Good sound but not durable,"These earbuds offer decent sound quality and noise reduction for its price. Compared to my JVC earbuds, I can listen to the music on my iPod at the minimum volume level most of the time.The only bad thing is that the speakers in the earbuds tend to die fairly quickly. My first pair lasted for about six months, and my second pair is starting to break at a little over a year. I've been shopping around for new ones, but it seems like this model is still the best for the inexpensive price."
3,Great for Hip Hop Only..flimsy cord,"I purchased my first pair about two months ago. The price was very cheap and they advertised on the package great bass response. The bass was excellent as well as the noise isolation and price. However afetr only a month, I lost sound in one earbud because of the wire getting pinched right above the plug. I returned those to the store and exchanged them for a new pair, but the same thing happened again within two weeks..this time the plug seperated from the plastic housing...so great price and bass, but the quality is lacking."
3,Great sound. Bad fit.,"I tried using these headphones after seeing they had good reviews at CNet. I agree that the sound is great, I just couldn't seem to get them to stay in my ear. I tried changing the bud size but to no avail, they kept falling out during workouts. Also, I kept feeling like I had a vacuum lock in one ear and it affected the sound. This could be an isolated issue for me. I returned them. Wish they would have fit better."
2,One earbud broke within a week!,"I'm a big fan of bass, so I decided to get this product. At first, they were a definite improvement over the regular ipod earbuds, and they felt good too. But then one day, I pull the earbuds out of my pocket (I don't just shove them in I carefully place them in a little container that holds them) and I see that the left earbud is broken. The ""sphere"" that makes up the bud split down the middle, with all the exposed circuitry available for me to see. It still worked, it just didn't snap back together or anything. I got a refund and I am going to purchase a much better product."
4,Great sounding headphones.,"Completely silent to neighbors, which if you ride the train like me you know is a rarity. Good bass response. They do get a little muddy in the high frequencies, though."
4,Better than expected!!!,I was pleasantly surprised when my daughter said that the sound quality was much better than hte last set of earbuds that she had. We both have a problem with most earbuds due to small ear canal but the level of comfort is amazing as I tried them myself. I didn't expect the bass response to be as good as it was and even though they are not as good as my cupped earphones they have better than average sound quality.
1,Great sound--- fell apart almost instantly.,"My son bought them for our other son, and while the sound quality was great, they fell apart right away. It looks like a design flaw, because the plastic seam that hold the base together, just fell apart, and does not go back together. This was very disappointing because it was a gift that he saved up to give, and now is back to no head phones, because they are non-funtional."
1,Apparently loss of sound from one earbud is a pretty common finding,"When I first bought these in October 2006, one earbud plastic broke while I tried to pull it out of the package. Luckily the Tekserve folks allowed me to exchange it; apparently it happened so often V-Moda should call it a package design defect. Also, the silicon plugs keep getting pulled off so I keep losing them. My left earbud finally stopped working after 14 months of use, and I used them only once a week. Also, the bass is clear but the mids and highs are muted. I use my iPod to lower the bass just so I can hear the vocals. This is a bad product for its frequency range and durability."
1,Stopped working after a month,"It only took a month for this piece of junk to stop working, sound only comes out of one side now. Sound quality and fit were good, but what does it matter if they don't work?"
2,Great sound while they last.,"For my iPod, I used the apple earbuds for a while. I probably put them through all hell and they still worked great. I just found them to be uncomfortable. I got these V-Moda's to replace them. They sounded great, but are exceedingly fragile. They broke within a week. I am a typical college student, so I always just put my computer, iPod, whatever else in my bookbag. The apple earbuds lasted and held up well, these didn't. The plastic is incredibly thin and the earphones cracked for no apparent reason. I am extremely disapointed and am sending them back."
2,great sound poor quality,Got these in May with pepsi points and today one side doesn't work. When they did work they were the best sounding earphones I've had. the earphone when not in use were put in the closet with the wire hanging down so the wire was never tangled no reason for them to break. if it wasn't for getting these through the pepsi points I would be alot madder than I am now.
3,"Good phones, bad cord",The headphones work as they are suppose to but the connection between the 3.5mm jack and the cord is not as strong as other headphones. After a month or two it will loosen up and your connection wont work.
2,DO NOT BUY!!!!,"I am on my third pair - yes that's right - my third! While the head phones are good when they are working and while the company has replaced them at no charge (shipping to the company was out of my pocket), they . all stopped working within months of receipt. I don't abuse them, I used them about 2 hours a day, they are not near water, they were not stepped on, nothing, not even a torn wire cover, not even a scratch. It was the same problem each time - I couldn't hear out of one earbud. I refuse to continue to use their product. They will not offer a credit or an exchange for something better. I have decided to buy a Sennheiser, which I was originally looking to buy but it was not available."
2,"Great sound quality, poor durability","These are great sound quality earbuds, but my first pair lasted 3 months, and my second pair only one month. I've sent both back to v-moda for warranty replacement. The wire at the ipod port connection is thin and not durable enough. Both times only sound will only come out of one speaker until you wiggle the wire. The port needs to be reinforced for better durability and repeat customers."
2,"Great sound, doesn't last",I bought these headphones two months ago and I just discovered today that one side doesn't work. It makes me sad because the sound quality was very good. However since they don't last long I don't recommend getting these. I only give two stars because the sound was good for the time it lasted.
4,nice sounding buds,"The V-MODA Bass earbuds sound better than the earphones that came with my iPod. Because the gel tips go into the ear, it blocks out some external sound but just a little. It may depend on the user but the gel tips make my ears tired after wearing it for a while.The only problem I had is the earbuds are pretty delicate. I have had 2 pairs break on my already. I threw away my first broken pair but I sent the 2nd broken and V-moda replaced it."
5,Love em!!!!!,"Just received these and not only do they feel extremely comfortable but they definitely work better than theUltimate Ears Super.fi 5 Pro Earphones (Black)I had before. I had bought them from headroom.com and paid $250 for them plus shipping. These headphones outperform the Ultimate Ears headphones by far in my opinion. I definitely recommend these headphones for anyone who loves bass. Very nice bass response, good mids and lows for being bass headphones."
4,"You paid a lot for your iPod, why skimp on how you listen to it?","Going third-party for earbuds was an easy decision as the stock Apple earbuds aren't that good, and they don't stay in smaller ear canals like mine. I've never understood why people are willing to settle for average audio quality when they paid as much as they did for that Nano or iPod Classic or other higher-end mp3 player. These earbuds provide solid bass response that doesn't come at the expense of highs and mid-ranges. This was a concern when reading earlier reviews of these earbuds, but I haven't really noticed any issues with overall audio quality.The reason it gets a 4/5 ranking is that they can pop out of your ears when moving around, but it doesn't happen that often. Secondly, the first pair I had lasted about 9 months before giving up the ghost. However, I'm giving them a second chance, since I prefer a solid bottom-end when listening to music."
3,"Bass excellent, but....","I have tried several mid-range priced earbuds from a variety of companies.I found these V-Moda to have excellent sound and bass (though it takes a while to figure out how deep to put inside your ear because the bass is quite load).I run daily for several miles each day and I find that I struggle to keep them in my ear. They come with three different sizes for your ear, but they still fall off with the sweat, etc.I think for simply listening casually these earbuds are great. If you exercise often and with the sweat, these may not work as well for you. (They would fall off as often as the IPOD cheap ear pieces during exercise.)"
1,Not worth it,"I was very disappointed in this product. The music sounds tinny and I had to turn the volume up. The earbud is comfortable, but the earbuds that came with my iPod are better. It wasn't worth ordering."
3,not bad if you have low expectations,"I picked these up as a backup to my Shure E2c and E3c headphones. I gave these three stars for one reason. They sound pretty good and have decent bass response. Having said that, they have absolutely no noise isolation. You can not wear these running or working out and have any hope they will stay in place any more than standard ear buds. Not having an L plug can be an issue depending on your type of player.Having complained enough, if you simply plan to sit at work or home and listen you will enjoy the sound. If you plan to wear on the street, train, subway, etc... forget it. Good value for the price. If you don't want to pay $100 or more for a quality sound isolating pair, grab these."
1,Not for me...,"Same review as the Sennheiser cx300's:I have been a musician for over 30 years, built and operated PA systems, worked professionally as a sound man and have spent a lot of time in studios, I know what I am listening to.These were better than the trash that comes with most MP3 players, but they really were very underwhelming, the bass was non existing in my opinion.Save your money, go to walmart and buy the $16.00 Phillips""virtual surround"" vented ear buds, they are much better unless you want total isolation. I don't want isolation, I would like to hear the truck that is about to run me over... But all that aside, the Phillips were the best out of 5 models I tested including the sennheiser cx300s."
4,little dynamo,"great little earphones. very clear very durable, I have been using them at the gym for about a month now and they sound great, i have no problem with the fit. Even with a sweaty head/ear and jogging they stay in place. The only down side I have is that ""bass"" is in the model name and I just dont hear that the bass is any louder than my cheaper sony head phones."
5,Worth way more than what I paid!,"I have never written a review before on any product I have bought but these headphones deserve special attention. These are by far the nicest earphones I have ever owned. The sounds that these little speakers produce makes me wonder how can earphones get any better. Their noise cancelling properties are excellent and they fit in my ear like a dream. Only concerns I have with them are I don't see them lasting for a long amount of time. The chord from the earpieces are very thin and flimsy. Also I wouldn't suggest buying these unless whatever device you have has an equalizer but, as soon as you find that sweet spot you'll never want to take them out of your ear. A 5 out of 5 is well deserved for these earphones."
3,Amazing bass for your buck but they don't last,I have yet to buy a pair that has lasted longer than about 4 months. One ear always stops working completely. For a while the cheapest ones were only $7.99 and I could rationalize $2 a month for terrific sound quality and comfort . Now that the price has gone up again I might shop around for something that will last. In the mean time I will be buying my 10th pair in a minute...
2,V-MODA Bass Freq Earbuds,"A great product if you do not use it. The cord durability suck. Great sound before the conductor breaks. V-MODA, please use heavier duty cords."
4,good bass but a little disappointing overall.,"After having some of the reviews, I had high hopes for these ear phones but I'm a little disappointed. The audio quality is definately good, especially the bass, but i feel the treble can be a little piercing and the the mid could be clearer. Although this definately depends on the the genre and quality of music you're listening to.These are the first in-ear headphones i've owned so they're not as comfortable as out ear headphones i think.These are still definately very good headphones, especially for the price. I would reccomend them for people who enjoy heavy bass, but there might be better options if you're looking for more balanced sound."
3,Great BUT the wiring sucks,I've gone through 2 vmoda's now. Both have been thrown out because the wiring has effected the sound by going in and out. If you're the type to have your ipod in your pocket while walking through the city and happen to sit down while your ipod is still in your pocket and its possibly bending the wiring of the input jack. Don't bother because its ruined it for me twice now.
3,Great Earbuds but...,"I have had numerous pair of these over the years and I absolutely love the sound they put out. They look great and sound great. My only complaint is durability. After a few months I end up having the wires begin to seperate from the ear bud itself. I try to be gentle with them knowing this problem, but the same thing always happens. I call V-Moda and as long as I have my original receipt, they will replace them for free which is nice, but it still is a problem. Make sure you keep your receipt!"
4,A surprising gift,"though the material may seem fragile, theses earbuds definately deliver, the bass on them are so sick, but it also has good sound quality on my non-rap songs, though id assume theyre not as effective."
3,NO bass,Owned 3-4 of these over the past 5+ yrs and there's no bass. I've compared them with headphones with decent bass and there's no comparison. Decent to listen to ambient music. Interesting that the price varies significantly with color. I bought my last green V-MODA on eBay for $5.95 and free shipping!!
2,Poor Quality,"The earbuds have very good sound & fit well in my small ears. The problem it the quality. They are very delicate & can damage easily. After going through two pair, I finally purchased Sony MDREX36V & now very happy."
3,Great sound quality for price but earbuds do not last a long time..,"I've purchased 3 V-Modas in the past. Why 3? Because they keep breaking in a year or less. The reason I keep buying them is because it's an affordable pair (I get the red ones) that has great sound and noise reduction quality. The only problem with these is that they do not last. This 3rd pair I have is broken, no sound coming out of the right side at all. The other pairs also had no sound coming out of one side unless I held the wire a certain way. It's come to the point where I wonder if it's worth it to keep buying a cheap pair or just invest on a more expensive one. I might have to check out another brand as these just have failed one too many times."
2,Disappointing sound and broke after 6 months.,I don't get all the great reviews. When I first got these I intended to return them but never got around to it. They just broke after 6 months and I only used them in the gym 4 days a week for an hour or so. They aren't terrible but sound tinny. I only paid $10 for them so I didn't expect greatness but I can't say that these sound better than the stock ipod buds.
1,"""I hate it"" is the perfect rating for these.","HORRIBLE quality of sound and when the wires moved, I had static or no sound at all. Do not waste your money!"
3,Not recommended,"I have owned two sets of V-Moda Bass Freq In-ear stereo headphones. The left ear bud on the first set came apart after about six months use. Using super-glue I fixed the problem. Since the sound quality is good for the money, I ordered a second pair about five months ago. Yesterday the left speaker stopped working. I use them sitting or lying down and do not abuse them. For the money they produce good sound, but don't expect a long life."
1,Good bass but didn't last much.,This was the first bass headphones i bought. Most say the bass sound great but less then a month the left ear bud stop working. I would not recommend buying V-MODA ear phones if your looking for everyday use of ear buds.
5,Awsome! Best Earbuds EVER!,"I'll make my review short and sweet. I agree with everyone who has said these buds bring excellent BASS. They Do, and you don't have to kill your ear canal stuffing them in to get in. Just gently place them in your ear and you have awesome sound!"
2,"Great Sound, Crappy Product!!",I have bought atleast 2 of these in the last 2 years and they fell apart less then a month of owning them. The wiring may short out also if your not careful. On the plus side they have terrfic bass and clear treble for the buck. So unless you keep these in a secure place and do not use t hem everyday then I would recommend them (maybe).
3,not small enough...,"these earbuds do sound great, however even the smallest fitting (it came with 3 sizes) is still too large for my ears. The earbuds won't seat properly and therefore often fall out and I am constantly having to push them back in to reseat them in my ears while running, walking, lawn mowing, etc. Other reviews had said these would be good for small ears, so just adding a cautionary word on that aspect."
5,v-moda bass freq earphones,"These are great earphones for sound quality, especially the bass frequencies. My only complaints are: ear buds are easily detached and the straight plug gives out the result is loss of sound from one or both channels."
2,Self-destructs after 3 months!,"I bought these earbuds to replace my broken Senn CX300s and originally gave them 5/5 stars after using them for about a month. They had decent sound, a comfortable fit, and unbeatable value. Three months later, they fell apart.I gradually lost sound in the right ear over the course of a week and noticed the jack coming out of it's protective covering. Soon enough, the whole jack fell out. It was like the solder or adhesive or whatever just dissolved when v-moda decided they wanted another $20+ from me. Well, nice try, v-moda, but my next $20 is going to a soldering iron to fix my drawer full of broken earbuds. :("
1,"Bought 2 sets, both broke within 2 months!!!",These produce great sound but they are so cheaply built that I bought two sets and they both stopped working suddenly within 2 months. They are a complete waste of money and frankly the company should be ashamed for producing such a cheaply made product.
5,Great Value,Nice earphones - good value. Had them for about a month and have good sound. Light weight and fit in ear well. Help to cut sound from outside when pressed in your ears.
3,Okay,"I bought these to replace my old JVC earbuds that after two years of heavy use and wear and tear have all but given out. The sound is good and the bass is better than average; however, I wouldn't advertise them as sound isolating and the ""modawrap"" seems unnessecary seeing as how the cord is only a couple feet long (which was another disappointment for me, my old JVC buds had a cord at least twice as long, which was nice for listening to music on my computer without disturbing others around me). Overall I'd say they're okay, not great, but not a bust either."
3,Not Great.,Can be very bassy and is best for hip hop. I like all music genres so for rock and most genres these arn't that great. The bass can be overwhelming for my ipod depending on the EQ setting (I'm using treble booster eq setting which sounds good IMO). I also noticed the treble almost sounds watered down like a re-encoded mp3 at certain frequencies. This are definitely good for 20$ and no more. They're very cheaply made. I do like the plugs that come in 3 sizes S M L. They fit snug and dont fall out.
2,Sound great while they last,"I've had two sets of these now and love em but cannot get them to last more than a couple of months. For the price maybe I shouldn't complain, but at $25.00 a pop I could have bought something else that would have posibly lasted longer. I do have a couple pair of higher priced earphohes that just are not as comfortable but they're over a year old and still work great. So my challange is to find something that is as comfortable and sounds as good so I'm back in the market looking at some other highly rated earphones.Maybe after a year their longevity has improved but..."
2,Breaks easily,"I loved the sound of these headphones, and the hot pink looked really good. I had one for six months and used them like no other cause the bass was bangin. Then, the left side just died. I stopped using it. I thought maybe it was because I kept it in my purse all the time it probably just smashed around and broke.Bought them a second time. Used them for no longer than a month and the left side stopped transmitting sounds. What a waste of money. I switched over to JBuds, and realized that you can get quality sound that lasts longer just for a few dollars more. The pink isn't as nice, but at least I can use it."
2,Make sure you try them before you buy them.,"I just bought these in late June 2007 and the feel is a little awkward because they stick inside of your ear further than usual ear buds. This makes the sound a little more clear and there is less background noise, but I find having something inside my ear like this is a little too strange.My main beef is with the company. I purchased these only two months ago and have only used them on my Creative Vision M player and they burnt out for some reason in the middle of a song. Now there is no sound at all on any device I plug them into and V-moda wants me to pay to ship them to them plus I will get another pair of them which I already don't want so I will have to sell these on ebay or something and then buy some other brand. Such a hassle!!! I just would like a check for what I paid and a free shipping label to send them back to them. I don't think that's too much to ask for a product that they back so well verbally."
3,not for people who like to yank them out by the cord...,I bought these for my daughter and they have worked fine. As far as I know she likes them but one day she yanked them out of her ears by the cord and one of the buds fell apart. It came apart at the seam in the middle. I thought I was going to have to glue it together but after messing with it for a minute it snapped back together and stayed together so I guess they are not glued at the factory. So just be aware not to pull the cord on these to get them out of your ears.
5,These ear buds kick butt,"These ear buds kick butt. vibrant,warm lows and crisp, clean highs. sound great from metel to hip hop to soft rock. would deffinately recomend these to anyone looking for quality sound thats not going to hurt your wallet."
3,Not too good,"Not too bad ... but not too good either, I have a zen nano from crative labs(mp3 player) and the earbuds that came with are by far much better, I just was expecting a lot more for a set that cost about the same price of the mp3 player(that incluede earbuds).I just wanted to buy a set before mine died on me."
5,Besy Ear-buds Ever !,"I used my Pepsi Points to buy these, as a back up pair in case my $99 Bose in-ear buds broke, and the V-Moda's sound twice as Good as the Bose !!! and they were half the price. I strongly recommend you buy these if you need to replace or 'upgrade' your ear buds."
1,"Good Sound, But Gone after a month!!!","I purchased these headphones one month ago and since then they have went out in both ears making them completely useless. To boot, do not buy the insurance, because it is simply a con. You have a warranty with V-Moda before the purchasable warranty company above, and V-Moda will charge you for 5 dollars for shipping there and back which is pointless for $19.99 headphones."
1,Poor Design & Quality,"Plastic used is of very poor quality. Broke when taken out of package. Was able to glue back together. Sound quality for the price was good, however after a few months audio failed. Now looking for a more durable brand."
3,comfy but not sturdy,"I got these headphones because all my other earbuds seemed to have a short life, and these got a good review on CNET reviews. They are so far very comfortable with good sound, but one of the earbuds has been coming apart after only using them a few days. It's easy to snap the pieces back together, but I wonder how long these will be functional for."
2,not that great,I did not find these earbuds to be as good as other reviews I read.They were a little tinny and did not have the bass range I was hoping for
3,fit comfortable,I am using the v-moda bass freq earbuds mainly for working out at thegym. I'am very satisfied in the way they stay comfortably in my earsand I also like the way they sound. You don't have to turn the volume up to cancel unwanted outside noises.For $40.00 bucks I would recommend them!
1,Broke a week after I got these,"I got these in the mail and it looked like they were going to work out fine but a week after I got them, the right earbud stopped working and then the other one stopped working. Now I have to send them back to the manufacturer to have them fix it. I guess I was expecting better what with all of the good reviews this product received but I'm really not impressed. If you're going to buy these earbuds, hope that you get a pair that doesn't die on you a week after you get them."
2,Good . . . until it dies,"No real complaints about the sound or distorted bass. The fit was also quite comfortable and with a somewhat extended commute, that's definitely something I appreciate. What I don't appreciate though is that after about 3 months, sound stops coming out of the left earbud because of the thin wiring and inadequate protection. I replaced one set of these and three months later, the exact same problem has arisen."
4,V-Moda Bass Freq Earbuds do not have enough volume,"I purchased the, ""V-Moda Bass Freq Earbuds"" for use with our portable DVD player while taking trips. This week I put the earbuds to the ultimate test. I used them with our portable DVD player on an aircraft and found that the volume was not sufficient to be heard over the background noise of the aircraft. Other than this, they seem fine. Regarding the aircraft use, I will investigate ""noise cancelling"" earphones or headphones!!!"
1,Breaks after a few months of use.,"After about 4-5 months of using these earphones, the left one stopped working. I've read about this in the reviews, but I was careless; I ignored them and ordered these earphones regardless.If you want to take the risk, then by all means go for it. The bass is powerful, the noise isolation is great, and the sound quality is somewhat decent. Too bad it might just stop working after a few months."
5,You won't be disappointed if you buy these earbuds..,I ordered them on 2/19/09 between 12-1pm. They arrived at my home on 2/20/09 around 3pm. Thanks Amazon for the amazingly fast delivery time. I plugged them in tried them on and WOW!! I'm going to buy 2 more next week!! I say again you won't be disappointed if you purchase these earbuds.
5,Better than more expensive buds,"I recently purchased an iPod Touch and quickly determined that the included ear buds needed updating. I went directly to the so-called ""top of the line"" (consumer) buds by Bose and found them to be difficult to position for the best sound quality. Then went to a less expensive set by Sony and found them to be, at half the price, more comfortable and better sounding than the Bose. I wasn't quite fully satisfied, however, and continued my research, coming up with the V-Moda's. These are the in-the-ear-canal design, as are the Sony's. Based upon favorable reviews, I decided to give them a try. After using the three buds for an extended time, the V-Moda Bass Frequency earbuds are, by far, the best, in terms of audio quality, comfort, and price.JT"
2,only lasted for 1.5 months,"The sound on these was okay, I agree with some of the other reviews that mid-range was lacking, and I wasn't blown away by the bass. My problem was that the wire right above the connector frayed and broke after 1.5 months of daily use, first one side went quiet then the other. Really disappointed in how quickly they stopped working."
4,"Great Sounding Earbuds, Had to Return Once",First set worked 20mins then one bud wouldn't work. Great Amazon return process - easy printout of mailing label and inside-box instruction return sheet (no shipping cost).Second set works perfectly. Excellent fidelity; blocks nearby sounds down considerably. Highly recommended.
3,v-moda bass freq earbuds,Great price. Solid sound for value. Great bass with larger foam fittings. More treble /midrange with smaller foam fittings. Flimsy cable compared to more expensive earbuds.
4,Great upgrade from free earbuds,"The vModa Bass Freq are a great upgrade from free earbuds that come with your iPod. The 3 sizes of of foam allow a good seal with your for better highs, plenty of bass, and a more enjoyable listening experience.Perfect for use at the gym or on the go."
2,"Nice for first week, then...","I purchased these for an iphone / ipod I use when running or working in the yard. They worked fine for a week and then the right ear bud popped apart and the wires inside tore from the terminals. The sound quality was very good for the price and fair overall, but the quality of the product and its construction was terrible. I would also suggest you look at alternate products that have an angled headphone plug. The angled plug tends to last much longer than the straight plug found on this model."
3,Decent,"The sound quality is ok, but not as clear as some of the headphones I have had from Sony. The headphones dont stay in my ear very well and I have to constantly adjust them. Also the part of the cord that inserts into the player is straight (like ipod headphones) and not L-shaped like most headphones which makes me think they will break easier, but no trouble yet (1 month in)."
4,They do the job,"Yeah these things work well enough to buy and the bass is better than most earsubs. But they are no where near the best. The best earsubs ever are pelican's universal headbanger earsubs, and those only cost $20. The bass on those is spectacular, but I cant find them anywhere so if anyone knows please get back to me. But about these V-modas, get them to tide you over until you find the aforementioned headbanger earsubs."
5,"Huge bang for you buck, a definite worthwhile investment.",So much of a difference when going from $5 ear buds to this in terms of sound quality. Makes a world of difference for me. I love it.
5,V-MODA Bass Freq Earbuds - Bling Bling Black - Best Sound Yet,The V-MODA Bass Freq Earbuds are fantastic. They fit well. The seal is good enough to block out wind sounds when biking. In fact their sound is so good after listening to XM through the earphones the car sound system sounds weak. I actually thought someone had changed the settings in the car. The earbuds provide good detail and excellent bass. I haven't listened to any high end buds yet but for the money these must compare very well.
4,Good but no cigar...,They have good sound--a bit too much bass for some genre--but overall very good. I've had them about a year and listen w/ them mostly at the gym. Last week they crapped-out: An apparent short in the line causes them to only work on one channel now. Very disappointed!
1,Great While They Lasted!,"Like others, after a few weeks my left speaker went out. Are these intended to be disposable? I think they should advertise them as such!"
5,awesome headphones,i bought these to replace my bose headphones until i could purchase another pair.i thought these would be crappy but man i was wrong.These wont stand up to bose but they are a good replacement.they are a nice pair of phones i will be buying another pair for a spare.i highly recommend to any one looking for a good pair of headphones
3,Great Headphones for Cheap,"The bass and sound from these earphones are fantastic. I have thoroughly enjoyed them over the past 5 months. However, I have noticed more and more that the sound in my right headphone cuts in and out depending on the wire placement. Now it's near impossible to get any sound from the right headphone without holding the wire at a specific point, a la old school tv antenna. So buyer beware about that, otherwise fantastic set of earbuds. A five star set of earbuds reduced to 3 stars due to horrible durability, at least from my experience."
1,V-MODA Bass Freq Earbuds - Blue Steel,Got these for my son for Christmas and only one ear bud worked. I went to return it through Amazon and it was not listed in my account so now I stuck with nonworking ear buds and no way to return them.
2,"That's what you get for spending that much money, I guess","These headphones had great reviews, so I bought them. I immediately regretted in when I opened the package. These sound cheap, especially in the mid-range sounds, like vocals. These headphones may be okay for people who do not know the difference, but I went from a very good pair of headphones to this pair. I noticed the difference immediately. They are definitely not the worst ever, but the price definitely matches the quality."
1,sounds like toy earphones,"These are the worst sounding earbuds that I have ever put in my ears that cost over USD2.99I mean, they really sound cheap and juvenile.I really feel cheated and would never purchase this product again."
2,Vibe-moda,The sound isn't very great. I have BOSE earbuds already and just wanted some spares. There is NO COMPARISON.Get the BOSE instead.
1,Bass?,Very disappointing. After having Bose in-ear phones these seemed to be huge step down. Very tinny and shrill sounding no matter what EQ setting on my iPod. I figured you get what you pay for and I returned them to Amazon. On a whim I bought some Magnavox MHS1100 earbuds at Target for $6.99. Wow! They were way better sounding than the V-MODA Bass Freq Earbuds with much better bass! Very happy!
3,Too Much Bass,"I have a pair of Sennheiser CX 400 In-Ear Headphones (Black) and they're awesome. I wanted a second pair for ""on the go"" so I wouldn't risk damaging the Sennheiser's, so I thought I'd try these by V-Moda.They're terrific in every way except one: there is too much bass. As others have commented, I end up turning down the bass and turning up the treble in order to get more of a balance to it. I like bass, but I think they overdid it!Also, bass aside, they don't have the same outstanding sound quality that my Sennheiser's have. The V-Moda ones sound much better than a lot of the stuff that's out there, but the sound quality (apart from the bass issue) is not as good as the Sennheiser's.Comfort is good, build quality is good, etc. I give 5 stars for everything else. However, because the sound they provide is the primary point of having them, I have to give only 3 stars."
3,Good sound for the price,These earbuds have a nice bass to them. The highs are not quite sharp but not bad. Worth the money.
4,"Perfect Bass and seal, but i lost one silicon earplug.","The good:- WOW! They seal you ear PERFECTLY! I can't hear a thing, except for the song, of course.- The bass os very good and the song doesn't seem distorted. You just need to get used to the bass on the first day of use.- They look good!The Bad:One time I was hiking and one of the silicon plugs felt off when the were hanging on my shirt, and I ended up losing it.I recommend this product!"
1,Looks nice but lacks quality.,"Bought these as a Christmas gift for my daughter. She likes the fit, but the left earbud stopped working after two months. The right earbud still works so she is now listening to her music in monaural. If this had happened with my older daughter, I would have said that it is the norm for her. But, my younger daughter is meticulous in taking care of her stuff. I can not recommend this product."
4,Great after a little EQ tweaking,"This is my second pair of V Moda Bass Frequency Earbuds (I sat on and broke my first pair). If I hadn't loved my first pair so much, I wouldn't have bought a second pair! These are GREAT for noise isolation and truly provide smooth, clean, and punchy bass response. Admittedly, I had to tweak my Mp3 player's EQ settings to over-compensate on the highs, but once that is done it sounds great! I can really appreciate the isolation when walking around next to the hospitals and I can't hear the MediVac flying in overhead. I even use these sometimes when playing drums along with music, and they work for that, too! The newer pair I have has a plastic cord, whereas the first pair was more of a grippy rubber-like material. I don't have a preference. I'd recommend getting a small carrying case for these. They aren't built like a tank, so you do need to care for them. Other than that, I've got no complaints about these. I LOVE them!"
3,"Good Sound, Bad Jack","I really liked the sound for the price, but after only a few months a short developed at jack end of the cable. It would be more sturdy if it were an angled jack, or some reinforcement at this stress point."
2,sound is not that good,"These buds do not sound better than the standard apple buds. I also just bought some Philips earbuds from Walmart for about $12 which sound better than the V moda. The Vmoda do fit nicely in your ear and perhaps people with small ears will prefer them.Here is how I rate the sound. My BEST headphones are over the ear Sennheiser EH 150. I rate them a 10. The Philips earbuds are second at 7, apple standard buds third at a 6, and V Moda last at a 5. Maybe when I get some coin I will buy a pair of Sennheiser's earbuds, but they are pricey."
5,Great catch,These are the best ear bud headphones I ever owned. Great sound quality (better than Bose)amazing bass and they fit in your ear without struggle. Besides that the price is right. If you have an I-Pod and want to produce good sound quality get V-moda!
5,Great Earphones.. best i've ever had,gives lots of great bass but it must be u really got to put these earplugs in good... the sound isolation is pretty nice they're like earplugs but with subwoofers in them...
2,Good sound but break easliy,"The V-MODA Bass Freq earbuds' sound quality and noise isolation are both very good. However, the 3 pairs my wife and I have had over the past 2 years have all failed in the same way. The wire breaks near the hard plastic plug and the sound cuts out in one or both earbuds. I was particularly careful not to wind the wire too tightly when storing, but it broke anyway after about 9 months. My wife's lasted about 6 months. At $20, these may still be worth getting (my first pair was $50). Just be aware that they won't last long, especially if you're exposing the wire to lots of movement (e.g. running, stuffing it in a bag). They are covered by a 1 year warranty, but I am still waiting for the replacement a month after sending in the broken ones."
2,"great sound, but they do not last","They sound great and will not fall out of your ear when you are running/exercising. They fit so well that they drown out most of the noise on the subway even when the volume is off.I must admit, however, they are not durable.My 3rd set just started giving me problems this week. The plug connection is always the same issue- there must be a design flaw or something.After 2+ years and 3 sets I am currently looking for a new brand."
5,Excellent in-ear buds,"I have had these for over a year and keep coming back to them when needing a pair of ear buds I can keep in my ear for up to 6-8 hours. What I've noticed is how good they sound. I have several in-ear buds, UE, Bose, Dre, etc. They each have a unique sound depending on what I'm listening to. UE superbrass is great for club, Dre is great for HipHop, Bose for classical. I've found these, the cheapest, to have the best all around sound. Well worth the money and I've had no problems with them. Update, the cord broke...so I ordered two more. They're so cheap in price and sound so damn good I don't even care."
3,"Great Sound, Cheap Cord: Stopped Working After 3 Months","Just like many cheap headphones, the cord became damaged near the jack (though there is no visible damage to that area) from normal use, rendering them non-working. The sound was great while they worked; I preferred these out of two other pairs I tried based on sound. They had plenty of bass thump while not being overly-tuned for bass and under-tuned for the other ranges (like the Pyle PIEH30B Ultra Slim Super Bass headphones). And the design is not uncomfortable like the Skullcandy's INK'd headphones with the serrated casings. If you're the kind of person who loses headphones and other similar objects on a regular basis, these might be the ones for you; stock up on a few pairs since they're cheap and don't last long. Otherwise, I'd suggest getting something more durable, like a pair of headphones with a kevlar-reinforced cord. I'm going to try the Etymotic's MC5s next and see how they hold up in comparison."
5,Very Nice,Really like these little earbuds. They sound great and the price can't be beat. So good I bought an extra pair.
1,worked for two weeks then broke,After less than two weeks of use both earbuds came off.Lousy quality. Why even make something this poor quality?
5,SUPER BASS is quiet under conditions,I work in a cubicle with low dividers and these are so quiet listening to dubstep on about 30% volume.This is throbbing in my ear bass. Even with the music off the noise isolation is great for putting background conversation down to a un-intrusive pitch.
2,headphone jack connector breaks,"I've bought these ear buds three times. The first pair lasted over a year and I loved them but the jack connector degraded and I couldn't get any sound out of them. The second pair lasted around 8 months and then also lost sound connectivity. The third, and last pair I will buy, lasted only two weeks and the connector just broke completely."
4,Good Earbuds for Daily Listening - Bass Response is Good,"I purchased these earbuds from V-Moda as they were discounting their V-Moda Bass Freq for $8.88 each. They only had the ""Jungle Green"" and the ""Jungle Green Camo"" which has some brown on the buds. I got the Camo to be more ""masculine""They definately have increased bass response but lack in the midrange. I bought these mainly to see what kind of product V-Moda has to offer at the lower end of their product line (I have my eyes set on the Vibratos). I was not disappionted by what I heard. Even with the i-pod at the ""bass boost"" setting they still gave a strong, clear bass response. Even though the midrange is lacking, the high end is crisp and clean.These are a great set of earbuds for everyday use. The wires are thin, but if you are careful, these should be a good choice for everyday use.I would love some feedback on their mid-priced buds like the Remix or Vibe Duo.Enjoy"
1,Stopped working after two months,"I was sorely disappointed with these earphones.At first I was pretty excited about them; they seemed to be working great--I bought them to replace a pair of iFrogz earphones that suddenly stopped working. After about two months I started having the same problem with these as I did with my previous earphones. I had music on, and midsong, the earphones stopped working. I could hear the music fine, but the singer was so faded out that I could not even hear the words. It sounds almost like I am listening to someone sing underwater. This is the SAME thing that happened with my last earphones. I'm very upset that I spent the money on these only to have them break on me. I would NOT recommend buying these."
1,High Expectations ... A Bust,"With all the great reviews I thought these buds would be the bomb. But instead they bombed. The best that I can say is 'tinny.' Tried different music, different devices, different bud sizes. Nothing helped. Did I get a bum pair or follow bum reviews?"
2,"Poor quality, but good sound","I've had this for 3 months now, and they're starting to break.I've paid $28 for this, and they're breaking just after 3 months.The sound is good, but not $30-a-month good."
2,Great for first 5 months...,"Like I stated above these headphones are great. Amazing sound and great bass. However, they only worked for less than 5 MONTHS. Like CNET stats, ""thin cable tangles easily and may not hold up in the long run."" And the later is TRUE. The cables are very thin and mines don't show any signs of wear and tear. But they just stopped working. If I want sound, I have to squeeze the cables constantly and it is truly annoying. BEWARE!!! Advise you to buy something else where the cables are strong and headphones have great sound."
1,"Music Lovers, Be Warned.","Let me begin by saying that when these bad boys were fully functional, they were amazing. I'm no sound expert, but the bass was bumpin' (when I was listening to electronica and house like daft punk and justice), yet songs with a lot of treble (like""Last Nite"" by the Strokes"") sounded exceptional as well.That is... while these stupid things worked.Two months into buying them, I get them out of my pocket only to discover that the left earbud stopped working. I tried contacting V-Moda but gave up, cause I ended up losing the earphones haha.Seriously though, if you enjoy wasting 35 dollars on a product that will work well... for 2 months.. then go ahead.I am not alone in saying these things can and will break. Many other reviews here agree with me, so do yourself a favor music lovers. Look elsewhere and buy yourself another pair of more durable earphones. You deserve it."
2,Good While They Last,"Initially I was quite happy with these earbuds. I mainly used them walking to and on the bus with an mp3 player in my pocket. The sound quality was good and they stayed in my ears better than the Sony MDR-EX71. However, within the last year I've gone through two sets of these, both with the same issue. One earbud would stop producing sound and then within a week the other would fail as well. The problem appears to be wear at the junction where the cord goes into the plug. Cosmetically these looked fine, but they wouldn't produce sound. These earbuds just can't stand up to everyday use with an mp3 player in your pocket. I will be replacing these with a hopefully more durable pair."
1,Not durable,"Both ear buds broke apart, connected only by the thin wire carrying the signal, within three weeks. Normal use, inserted and removed from ears.Hope you have better luck. Earbuds looked great, sounded great."
4,Sound Investment,"I had these for a few months now but never used them still last week. WOW! I don't know much about earbuds, my creative ones always fell out and sounded horrid. The I-pod ear phones the same. I thought this was my lot unless I wanted to wear full size head phones which are a chore to carry. I was riding the subway on a long commute and put these on. I set my Ipod to random. I worked the earphones till they fit and hit play. I was startled! I sat upright and looked around. Could everybody hear what I was hearing? The bored looks suggested not. But I had been transported. From Aretha to Bach I was hearing all the music! From James Taylor to Mos Def I was hearing clarity I didn't think was possible in earphones. The noise of the subway faded away and I was in my own private listening room. This is bass driven so you may want to adjust your equalizer"
4,To get a better sound you will have to spend over $100!,"I have compared these against some much more expensive headphones and they stack up nicely! I tried Bose in-ear headphones but couldn't get them to seal, so they didn't sound good at all. I tried Shure SE110's and there was minimal clarity difference, and there was distortion in the same places, though that has only occurred a couple of times.Overall I am very pleased. My conclusion is that to get a better sound than these I am going to have to spend well over $100!Be warned though, they are VERY heavy on the bass. I had to adjust my EQ to tone the bass down."
2,"Sound good, poor quality","Bought 1 pair for my wife and another for my son. Less than two months later I'm returning both pairs because they are shorting. My son is a teenager and I'm sure he moves around more than my wife...But my wife's pair actually went bad first. Both are V-Moda Bass Freq Earbuds, both suffer from the same problem...I think I would look elsewhere for product."
5,Huge Bass,"These headphones are awesome. They offer a ton of bass, and great overall sound quality. If you're not in to bass, they could be too much for you, but if you are, you'll love them. They plug in your ears, which is pretty comfortable and provides excellent exterior noise cancellation. I bought them for $20, which is incredible value."
4,Very good earbuds for the price,"Very good earbuds for the price. Deep (but not exagerrated) bass, clear highs, punchy midrange. The most accurate sound reproduction you are going to get for the price. Other earbuds selling for this price (I am talking about Amazon's discount price, not the list price, of course) are absolute junk."
4,V-MODA earphones,It performs like $50 earphones but costs only $25. Awesome!!V-MODA Bass Freq Earbuds - Bling Bling Black
2,Worst Ever!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?,1 month it has been perfect. then today it is broken and now i hav to buy a new one. nvr nuy it
1,Hope this is a mistake,"I previously had a black version and I lost them. They were pretty much what everyone else says about them. This pair was a joke. Everything sounded like a transistor radio. No bass at all! I tried them on all types of music and devices and finally gave up and returned them. I have purchased another pair. Hopefully, I'll be back to the first set."
2,Not Durable,"I had these headphones for about 2 months before they stopped working in one ear. Though the sound quality was good, I don't think it is unreasonable to expect a little longer life out of them."
1,Surprised and Disappointed,"I'm very surprised at the ratings and reviews this product has received. The ipod earphones are much better, have better bass and are less expensive.These are tinny and screechy by comparison, and are not comfortable."
1,Complete garbage,"I have no idea why people say these headphones have lots or bass, or even that they're better than the iPod headphones...neither is true. They are dinky sounding and have a cheap, plastic-ey feel. I'm a DJ and my ears are well trained to pick up good audio quality and these are garbage. Returning immediately."
1,This must be a joke,"These headphones are unbelievable bad. I have never written a positive or negative review for any product, but I felt compelled to write about this product. The stock iPod earbuds sound WAY better. These v-moda ones are loud, but there is no bass and they sound very tinny, and I have tried them on two separate iPods and my computer. Maybe I received a bad pair, but this was one of the worst purchases I have ever made."
1,"Big rip off, save your $$","I bought these plugs in 11/06, I all ready needed to replace them. The right earplug stopped working after a month. Prior to that time, great sound. I jogged and worked out w/ them 3times/wk. Very disappointed. The cheapo plugs that came w/ my mp3 lasted at least a yr and I jogged /worked out them almost everday. Soooo...if you're satisfied w/ a month's worth of excellent, stereo concert quality, surround sound, go ahead and blow $30+. Otherwise, keep looking for plugs of better quality."
1,Broke after 2 weeks,"They sound terrific, but lost sound out of left ear after only two weeks! Wires are too flimsy!"
1,Warning warning warning,The v-mode bass has low sound performance and low design durability. Cheap is the correct word to describle these buds. Any star above 1 has to be fake or someone that is completely tone deaf. I paid $8.88 and this amount is too much. How could any respectable audio company consider these as a worthy audio product? Their comparison for good audio must be a 4k hz land line phone or 2 tin cans. In today's age our society can't waste our time on such a waste stream product. 1 star at $8.88 is an appropriate rating.
4,Nice Buds,"I bought these as a replacement to the standard Apple ear buds that come with the iPod. The first day I compared them to the Apple buds and couldn't really tell a difference. But when I actually used them for an extended period of time, I could really tell the difference. I walk 1.5 hours a day and these buds have made my walks much more enjoyable. They have great clarity and dispersion. The bass could be a little better that is why I gave them 4 stars. Buy them, you'll like them. Plus, why would I spend time writing this review if I didn't have a strong opinion."
4,Great!,"These headphones are wonderful! While I'm by no means an audiophile, I do listen to my iPod everyday. The v-modas are definitely loud enough to keep me happy and they're pretty good at canceling out sound. I love them!"
2,"pretty good but fragile, break easily","sound is decent for the price, but the mini-plug broke after a month: the metal tip separated from the plastic housing. (Don't know if getting fixed is worth the hassle.) Wish they would make these of better quality."
1,Best turned to worst Earbuds I have used.....(Edited 12/2),"These are great sounding, fitting earbuds.....but they are very fragile! I have now gone thru 2 pairs because the wire going into the headphone jack keeps disconnecting and the sounds shorts out in one or both headphones.Very disappointed."
4,good sound and stronger wire than expected,The more you push the buds into your ears the fuller the sound. Good outside noise isolation.
5,Louder than I thought.,"These things are really loud. They blow away the standard ipod headphones. The bass is certainly noticeable, which is great on earbuds as they generally lack bass."
3,"Great value on price and sound, horrible construction","I've had at least 5 pairs of these headphones. They have great bass and very good sound quality for the price. They're geared towards listeners of bass heavy music - if you're a rap fan you'll absolutely love these.There is one problem though. As I mentioned before, I've gone through 5+ pairs of these headphones. The build quality is absolutely horrendous. I count myself lucky to keep a pair intact for 2 months. The only reason I keep buying them is the price; I pick up a pair for a few bucks every time I'm in between pairs of higher-end headphones. My most recent pair lasted a whopping two weeks before the plastic casing on one of the earbuds split apart. After that happens I can usually keep them together for another week or two before the wires break.If they could do something, anything, to up the durability of these headphones they would be incredible. For now I grudgingly give them only 3 stars."
1,Poor quality. Poor customer service,"The sound quality was impressive, but the right channel earphone failed within one week of use. An attempt to get a replacement or money back from the manufacturer was unsuccessful."
5,Great Earbuds!!!!,I puchased a couple of these and have used them for about 2 weeks now. I like them alot. The bass makes these a cut above any other earbuds in this price range. I like the full range of sound these provide. I like them so much a purchased two more for some friends.
4,A very good pair of earphones,"The missing star is because the in ear nature of this set can get a little tiring on extended use. They are excellent for use in a noisy environment and produce a good response at all volumes though it would be quite unwise to use it at anything more than medium volumes. The seal against ambient noise is quite good. The storage scheme is also innovative, though I would like to see how it wears over a few months."
3,Beats iPod but clearly not high quality earphones,"I bought a pair of these early october to replace the standard iPod earphones. I ended up returning them for a pair of Shures, but thought they were decent.Sound:The in-ear design provides a satisfying sound, especially at mid-volume. When I turned up the volume, however, the sound got very muddy and rather distorted. Highs and Mids were OK. I love a heavy bass, and was not disappointed as the bass is VERY noticeable.Design:The wires are thin and fragile and become damaged easily. Sometime in the third week the left earbud blew, much to my dismay. Amazon graciously sent me a replacement, but after I read about this happening to someone else, I decided I didn't want to play Russian Roulette with my earphones and bought some Shures.Despite my qualms, I'd say they're pretty good for a $35 pair of earphones."
4,GREAT PRODUCT,"This a great product, They fit comfortably in the ear and dont fall out when I go running. GREAT BASS and crystal clear sound. I dont see any reason I would ever upgrade. These are ten times better than the ones that came with my toshiba gigabeat. They also block out all my coworkers conversations. Cant beat the price. I would totally recomend these."
4,superb sound,These are truly excellent across the range bass to treble. The wires are a bit flimsy but nevertheless they're excellent earbuds.
4,"Good sound, comfortable but will it last?","This is the second pair of V-Modas I bought. They are very comfortable and lightweight with good sound. My first pair seems to be wearing thin at the point where the wire attaches to the plug so I don't think it will last. It would be good if V-Moda would reinforce that particular area. But, as I did buy these a second time I'd have to say I like them."
5,v moda Bass Freq,i have bought more than 20 of these! Most for gifts and the first few i had for myself and my girlfriend. It sounds amazing for the price with deep and rich bass. The only downside is the durability and the cables get tangled easily. I recommend the klipsch S40 but its about $80+ but if your in a tight budget Vmoda bass freq are for you
2,Worst Product Quality- Good Bass,"This is one of the worst headphones interms of the manufacturing quality. I bought 1 headphone and after some days, the left speaker stopped working. I called support and reported about the failure. They sent me a replacement. The replacement headphones also had same problem. Then i was sick of calling and arguing with them. I went for Sennheiser Rs130. It is worth for every penny and sounds great for both music and movies. I hook up my iPhone and listen to Pandora daily once i return from work."
3,Loved 'em til jack broke,"I loved these ear buds; the comfort, the sound, the fit. But, the jack broke off after less than a month of use. After reading the reviews, I decided they are just poorly made. Too bad. If not for that, I would buy another pair, but will try to find a better constructed pair."
3,Pretty good for price,"I bought these based on the other reviews that seemed pretty good. I was aware that, there were cases of 1 earphone cutting out. I figured I'd take a gamble and hopefully it wouldn't happen to me. But it did! After about 2weeks the left channel dropped out, fiddling with wire it would come back on. But it was never consistent and eventually I figured it would stop working. I kept using it for 2 weeks as I researched other earphones to buy. But luckily it came back to life and has not cut out in 2weeks of heavy usage.(5hours a day during week) So those that have issue with the earphone cutting out/in there might be some hope to keep it and see how it plays out."
2,Fell apart within 3 months,"Began great, decent quality and decent fit. First the plastic earbud covers fell off, and i used the extras. After losing the ones that fit comfortably, i order some replacements. About the same time, I noticed that the portion of the green earbud that connects to the ear would disconnect from the back piece. No a big issue, I could pop it back in and worked fine. The replacements stayed on but eventually the disconnect happened and the wires broke. Will not buy these again."
3,"Has bass, too drowny","Yeah, these have bass, but it's terrible. It just makes the rest of the song sound terrible.Not recommended if you listen to dubstep."
5,Just what I wanted,I frequently listen to dubstep and other bass heavy genres and these satisfy my bass needs perfectly. Even right out of the box they produced deep clean bass and for the price they are hard to beat. So if you are on a budget then get these you won't be let down.
2,Theyre really good. When they work,"These are some really good earphones, but they do no last longm I have had them for less than two months and the left one does not work anymore."
2,Broke after limited use in 30 days,"I've always had confidence in products I buy from Amazon. But in limited use, which was at the office for a week or so b/c we were on vacation for a couple weeks and didn't bring them, these things broke pretty easily, and unfortunately, just outside the return window. They worked well for the time that we had them but I'm fairly certain I will not be buying another pair of vmoda's."
4,Excellent sound quality,I've had my V-Moda Bass Freq In-ear head phones for a couple of weeks now and I'm very pleased with the sound quality across a range of music styles. Definitely worth buying.
1,Wasted Money,"I read so many reviews praising these. Unfortunately, they do NOT live up to their hype. The adjustable ear pieces are a piece of junk. Further, you can obtain equal sound with several $10-$12 earphones. Save your money, don't consider these."
1,Sounds great...easily breaks!!!,"I could easily call this the best budget earbuds out there for the price...BUT I've had several of these and they all broke the same way. A slight kink in the cord will lead to breaking (no sound from one or all ear pieces). Since I bought several of these, I figured I'd contact V-MODA customer service to let them know of the issue and to see if I can get a replacement. Sadly, they did not acknowledge this issue nor offered a replacement...with that type of customer service, I decided never to buy V-MODA product again.Go with the ME-Electronics earbuds...they are just as good and built to last."
5,Worth the price,"Pick the size that holds the buds in place, but still lets you push them in as far as they can go. These buds work best for me when they are in contact with the bone around the ear canal-that's when the bass kicks in."
1,Terrible sound-- just gadawful,"I saw all the great reviews here and figured why not, for the price? Don't waste your money. The crappy white apple iphones sound much better then these. True, the bass is ok in these vmodas, but the mids are honky and the highs are shrill and extremely unpleasant. You are better off with the freebies you get on a plane flight, no joke. I have several sets of regular and in ear buds, various price and quality, and they all sound MUCH better then these. Not worth returning, and don't fit my 11 year old daughter's little ear canals (I tossed the extra silicone inserts) so I am just going to trash these ultra-crappy sounding pieces of dung. I have a pair of Sony regular (not in-ear canal type, but the apple style ones) earphones that came with my droid that sound infinitely better then these, and the base is just as loud and much crisper. The high-mid and high's on these v-modas are actually ugly and almost painful at moderate volumes, and just nasty at low volumes."
2,Least Comfortable Ear Buds I've Ever Worn,"Okay, I'll keep this short. These ear buds sound great. They aren't lying when they say that they have amazing bass. The plastic feels quality. The cord wrap that it comes with works well.Here's my beef. They actively hurt my ears to wear from the moment I put them in.I don't know if its the rubber tip or what but they create almost a vacuum in my ears that is painful. Its not even uncomfortable, its painful. I tried once I bought them to stick it out and hope that the rubber tips loosened up or something but to no avail. Its rare that I get on Amazon to submit anything but a possitive review but I wanted to warn others how much these hurt. Its possible its just my ears but these don't work for me at all. The smallest size is too small, the medium fits but is painful, and the biggest is way too huge."
1,Worked great...for 3 months,"I purchased these earbuds for my iPod, which I use when commuting to work and working out on the treadmill. They worked great...for the first three months. One day, the right earbud stopped working altogether. Only then did I go back and look at all the one-star reviews by other users and saw that other disappointed customers experienced the same exact defect.I read on the seller's profile that defective items could only be returned within 30 days of purchase, so I am out of luck. Would not recommend this item."
1,"Formidable Bass, bad mid/high","I tried the three different earpiece sizes.With the smallest size, the earpiece did not complete seal well in my ear canal. Bass was really poor, but mid and highs were decent.With the medium size, the earpiece sealed completely. Bass was REALLY good, but the mid and highs were REALLY bad.Perhaps the issue is with the user's ears. when I put the medium size on, I feel like I am pressurizing the air between the headphones and my ear drum. When this occurs, perhaps my eardrum is unable to detect/vibrate appropriately to higher freq sound. But because the air is sealed tight, bass response is incredible.I returned this set because I could not have both. Either Good bass w/bad mid/highs, or bad bass, with decent mid/highs."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased these buds in September 2008 and used them a few times a week while walking. Yesterday, while going out for a walk I noticed that I'm hearing only half of the sound. It's hard to describe, but sound comes out of both buds, however, the bass-tones and certain background music isn't audible. During my walk I had to fidget with them in order to hear the song properly.I am writing this review as I know that I've handled them carefully and stored them after each use to keep them from any sort of damage. Why do I have to replace them after less than nine months of occasional use?"
3,"great for price, for a time","These headphones worked great. The different sized ear covers helped keep a good fit. They give good sound, not too quiet for such cheap buds. Basically, I loved them for $25. Sadly, 6 months later, one side has already shorted out and the ear cover size i liked came off and i have to use ones that don't fit as well. I didn't purchase any coverage, so sadly now I am out another pair of headphones. Had these not shorted out I would have given them 4 stars for sure. I am tempted to buy them again, though I will definitely consider investing in coverage that would replace them if shorted out!!"
3,Lots of bass,"I didn't somehow grasp that this thing was totally focused on bass. And yep, it has bass.I don't find that its sound is very well balanced (being heavily weighted towards bass), and because it doesn't allow air to pass through the silicon ear-fittings and itself, or through itself, you get that ""My ears are plugged with something"" feeling, which distorts the sound and reduces the quality of my experience.I hated that the apple buds tend to fall out. But these are worse, IMO. Not due to a defect in their design per se, just that their design isn't what I am looking for. If the above is exactly what you want, then they're great. But you should be aware of these issues before purchasing them."
5,great headphones,"These are some good headphones. They are light so you won't even feel them. The sound clarity is crisp and clear and they really do deliver some serious bass. They're a steal at $20 and being someone who takes headphones very seriously, I can say that they are better than some headphones that are 5x their prices.Drakh"
3,Zophotos,"The sound is great, but they keep falling out of my ears. They don't come with interchangeable rubber inserts, so they aren't a comfortable fit. Given this situation, I can't use them for the gym as I had originally planned. I use them when I'm sitting still on flights for business."
5,best earbuds for under $100,"I've purchased these Earbuds for 3 people now, I love them. The sound quality is great and the price is right."
4,Definitely Recommended,Excellent sound quality - very good bass response. Sound may be a bit unbalanced so you'll want some sort of equalization on your player to adjust the spectrum to your liking (I use them with an iPod nano on Acoustic equalization). Fits well - no problem maintaining position in my ear even during strenuous activity. Strain reliefs are a bit long but not prohibitively. Excellent performance for the price. Have to wait to see about durability.
2,They're alright - nothing special,"I recently purchased V-moda ""bass freq"" earbuds for my iPod Touch. I prefer the earbuds that came with the iPod for sound and comfort. The iPod earbuds seem to reproduce the sound of my music more naturally without the bass overpowering the higher frequencies. The iPod earbuds are much more comfortable. I don't like the way the V-moda earbuds insert into my ear canals creating pressure in my ears. I always know they're there. Fortunately, they don't cost a lot so there's not a lot at stake if you don't like them."
2,Nice but Fragile,"When I first got my Bass Freqs I loved them. They create rich lower notes well and I love the sound isolation capabilities. Then one of the earbuds began to play music noticeably quieter than the other. This happened only a couple weeks after buying the earbuds from Amazon. After getting a new pair on warranty, I was glad to find they worked perfectly after that... until one of the earbuds just fell apart. And it happened right after the warranty ended, too. Not only that, but the other earbud has just started falling apart, and they are both unreliable. I would not buy this product again, no matter how good it makes my music sound."
4,Sounds great!,"I just got these guys yesterday and they sound great. They don't sound as good as myV-MODA Vibe Duo Earbuds/Headset (iPhone Compatible) - Blackbut for $20-$25 you can't beat the sound. I actually got these because i was a little rough on my Vibe Duo's and had to send them in (under warranty) for replacement. I know they are cheapo's but if these last 6-10 months I'll be happy, and happily order more. BTW I sent in my Vibe Duo's (under warranty) and i had replacements in a week, no questions. Great company, great headphones, go get em."
2,Sound like tiny fitted beer cans,"There is no slidy, plastic clip to hold the earphones together like the stock ipod headphones. Oh well at least they have a lovely fit in my ears. Lovely until you turn on the music and find they are the worst sounding headphones you have ever owned. I tried ever EQ setting and music style looking for a reason to keep them.I threw them In the garbage can by day 3. I now have current generation apple headphones again and they are more comfortable and sound perfect."
3,not that impressed,"I expected good things considering the amount of very positive reviews. I was not overly impressed with the sound. Not that much of an improvement over stock headphones from samsung to justify the 35$. I am on a tight budget, and these headphones just didn't cut it. Firstly they are not very clear. Second Distortion is a problem, even with medium volume. Thirdly plastic housing feels pretty cheap, and the rubber ear pieces are not very sturdy. They honestly sound the same as stock, in ear headphones I got with a sandisk mp3 player a little while back. Overall they do the job, just not as well as I was hoping."
4,Sound awesome and comfortable,"Pros:Very nice sound and bassGood noise isolationComfortable for long period of timeCons:Thin cableStrait 3.5mm plug not ""L"" shaped"
5,Great bass for a great price!,"These earbuds are absolutely amazing! The sound quality is better than any I have ever experienced before, and at the price these come at ($19.99), you get your money's worth in your very first session. The sound isolation given by the silicon earpieces is unlike any I have heard (or should it be ""not heard""?) before. Any type of music with deep bass is perfect for these earbuds, and if you listen to any type of club/techno then the sound quality will blow your mind."
2,Good..for three weeks,"Got this product via the Pepsi points thing. Item quality was really good for the first three weeks I had it. However, I stored it in my backpack and one of the ear pieces completely fell apart. Sure, it wasn't stored as it should of (which is why i'm not that upset) but i've had much cheaper headphones that were stored the same way that lasted much longer. So, if you're going to get them, my advice is 'handle with care'."
2,"Hello Bass, Please return my music","These produced so much bass with my I pod that I could barely hear the music, just the pounding. I like bass, but unless that's all you want to hear, then these are not for you. There were a comfortable fit, but the cord tangles easily."
3,"BASS is good, that is it","I tried these earhones and I waited and waited and finally when they came I was so happy. Well when I was trying to pull them out of their tight packaging one of them slightly snapped. They still sounded the same, but they didn't look it. The bass is probably the only thing that is really good about these like I said before. The mids are somewhat there and the highs are almost no where to be found. The sound isolation was okay, blocking some noise while music was playing but my previous Etymotic Er6i isolators did a much better job for 40$ more. I did insert them all the way into my ears, for what seemed to be as far as they could go. All in all, if all you need is bass consider these, if not just look elsewhere.Oh yeah, I have a newer ipod, so sound coming from it is bound to be good. So there should be no problems coming from the music side."
3,V Moda Ear Buds,"Very good quality sound, good bass (but not as emapsized as some reviews might indicate) Certainly not overdone. Good value but not audiophile quality."
2,"Good sound, poor quality construction","On sound quality, this V-Moda is a definite improvement over the iPhone buds. However, the plastic shell on V-Moda buds began to disintegrate after 6 weeks. Cheap plastic, cheaply constructed. Also, the wires are so thin that they're constantly getting twisted up. iPhone's wires seem the perfect gauge to avoid this. So, iPhone buds may be have mediocre sound, but they're much better made. I wouldn't buy the V-Moda again."
3,happy,"it was hard to figure out the right ear plug size, but overall it's a good set. It sure beats the headphones that come w/ the iPod and that's what i needed. I can work better now in the open environment in my office."
2,Purchased 3x... 2x too many.,"I bought these because I read they were a great value for the price. The sound on these earbuds was a huge improvement from the white Apple buds I was using. My brother's dog then ate them so I ordered another pair which subsequently broke. Within a few months, the earbuds wouldn't deliver stereo sound. I had to mess around with the plug to get it to sound right. After getting tired of pinching the plug, I ordered a 3rd pair, figuring these had somehow gotten damaged. The same thing happened within a month..The Vmoda buds have good sound but you get what you pay for, as they won't last."
4,works surprisingly well,"I'm pleasantly surprised by these earbuds. They come with three different silicone buds so you can find a proper fit. You do need to push them slightly into the ear canal so they are seated properly. When you do, they act to dampen the sound from the environment, much like a ear plug. Consequently you can listen to music, podcasts, audiobooks, etc., at a much lower volume. However I really wish there was a ""pause"" or a ""mute"" button on the earbud line. When people start talking to you, it's hard to hear them so you will need to stop what you're listening to, and/or ""unplug"" the ear buds from your ears."
1,Where's the Bass?,"For headphones with a name like ""Bass Freq"", I thought there would be a noticable difference in the level of bass put out. Wrong!! They actually sound worse than the cheaper ipod style phones that they are replacing, although they are considerably more comfortable. I have to push them way far in my ears to hear any bass at all (and then they just slide back out)! I would not recommend these and will probably go back to the old style phones. At least I know they sound good."
2,"Great, but not durable","I have only had these headphones for three months, and during that time, I loved them, but I went for a walk this morning to discover the left earbud had lost all sound. I have only had these three months and during that time I was as careful with these headphones as was reasonable. They were great while they lasted, but did not last long at all. Unfortunately, I can't recommend anything better as most of the other headphones I have bought have had the same problem, probably due to the amount I listen of time I spend listening to music, which is hours a day. While they last, though, they are comfortable and the bass is much better than other earphones of this type."
2,Don't waste your money,"These earbuds were a disapointment. If you like a tinny sound, then go for it. I like some bass with my tunes, thank you. Earbuds are really comfortable. Too bad the sound is not as good as the comfort. I should have known. you get what you pay for."
3,Good for 4 months!,"This is great for bass and incredibly cheap, but i think the bass actually kills these headphones over time. So do buy these headphones if you want bass, but since they are so cheap you will have to re-buy them in 4 months because the bass is so strong it destroys them."
4,Not bad.,"At the time that I purchased these, they were the same price as the Sony MDR-EX71SLA earbuds. I had the Sonys previously, so I decided to give these a try (plus they won the 2006 CNET Editor's Choice Award). Unfortunately, the sound quality isn't as clear as the Sonys, nor is the bass as solid.The fit on these isn't bad, the swappable ear pieces is nice (the Sony comes with that as well).I've never found a use for that crummy little thing you wrap the cord around. The only thing it would really do is add weight to the cord and pull the earbuds out of your ear... *shrugs*All in all these earbuds aren't bad, but honestly I'd recommend going for the Sonys even if they are a little more money now."
1,"V-Moda Earbuds Don't Last Long, Neither Does the Warranty","I bought these v-moda bass freq earbuds in October 2007. I take very good care of my belongings and knew that these earbuds could be delicate after reading other reviews. Well it's the 1st day of November 2008 and the left earbud stopped working. Since it is just a couple of weeks past the warranty, I e-mailed v-moda hoping to get a replacement pair. The answer was no. So I spent a good chunk of money on this DISPOSABLE pair of earbuds. Take my advice and the advice of many other reviewers and buy a different brand of earbuds."
2,"Good sound, poor design","Although I like the sound quality of these earbuds, structurely they do not hold up. I replaced the first pair after one earpiece broke apart and now the replacement pair has done the same. I wish they were more durable because I do like the sound quality."
3,"Good for slugs, bad for jocks.","The sound quality is excellent...so long as you're not moving.I got these for running and was I disappointed. The wires create a noise that sounds like a pounding heart beat, which ruins the music quality. These are good for sitting around and listening to your tunes... But if you are exercising, forget about it."
5,ear buds,"These ear buds are the best bang for your buck. Espacially if you like heavy bass, good clear sound, and an affordable price. I love them."
2,Couldn't fit them in my ears!,"I bought the V-MODA earbuds because they had excellent reviews and were reasonably priced. I like an above average bass level so that appealed to me as well, but in this case I was wrong. The emphasized bass clouded the overall sound, and it definitely wasn't as clear as I would like it. The smallest gel casing was too big for my ear and kept popping out, which is really annoying while running on a treadmill. Also I did not like the feeling of it in my ear canal, I'd rather have earbuds like the ones that come with your Ipod that sit in your ear and doesn't leave you feeling like you have an ear infection."
4,v moda,i bought these earbuds based on the reviews from amazon and i can only echo the mostly positive opinions they are far better than the buds that come with your mp3 player and with 3 different sizes of silicone earpieces you are going to get a pretty good fit i always used portable headphones like sennheiser 100's or koss porta pro's but now i only use these they are just as good one more thing though they are a little bassy but i love big bass but then again i'm playing music with a lot of bass so maybe they are not that uneven and one review stated that they cancel out all outside noise i didn't find that to be the case at all you can still hear traffic etc. and are aware of what's going on around you they did take a week or so to break in but after that wow i just use these for walking so if you do a little more serious listening take a look at the klipsh earbuds that are the editors choice at c-net.
4,Nice earphones,"These are nice earphone for their price. The sound quality is pretty good and they are really comfortable in your ears for a good amount of time. Love the fact that they come with 3 earbuds of different sizes.But I do feel that the construction quality could have been better. I have had no problems so far, but it they feel a little delicate and it seems they need to be handled with extreme care.Overall, a nice product!"
5,Experience a whole new range of sound!,"Oh my god. I can't believe I spent so much time using the provided headphones that came with my iPod. Went on a review site looking for a nice headphone replacement for my iPod. Stumbled upon these ones with very high reviews. Gave them a chance and now I can't listen music without them. I know there are a bunch of other high end options like Sure and stuff but for around 40 bucks you can experience Bass like you have never heard before. THe clarity and punch of these buds are amazing.But hey, it's very important that you choose the correct silicone cap size for your ear as the catch for this buds to work perfect is to have a good fit insed the ear canal. If not you would not get the full quality sound.Totaly recomended."
2,Disappointing,"These buds were a disappointment overall. First, the good points: they look nice. they have a robust cable. Now, the bad: these earpods are wayyyyyy too boomy and bass accentuated! The high frequency response is poor. and most disappointing of all... YOU CAN'T KEEP THESE THINGS IN YOUR EARS!!! I have tried in vain to keep these buds in my earholes but to no avail. I am much happier with my Etymotic ER-6 earbuds. they are twice the cost but sound great and the design allows them to stay in your ears.... For decent sound earbuds need to stay in the ear canal with a ""seal"" established... Vmoda earbuds fail in this regard. Save your money and buy some Shures or Etymotics."
4,very good sound isolation,"This headset is fairly inexpensive when compared to others of its kind. The different sizes of earbuds let you choose the perfect size to maximize sound isolation, letting you listen to your music (and your music only) anywhere."
2,Very slight improvement in sound quality,"It's small and fairly attractive, however there's no improvement in the mid and high range compare to the cheap earbuds that came with my lousy $50 Phillips MP3 player. Only the bass is a little more prominent and it blocks out modest amount of external noise.I have really great hearing, if there's any improvement in sound I can definitely hear it, but there simply isn't much coming from these V-Moda earbuds."
3,Fantastic...while they lasted. Not for running!,"I loved these earphones. They were perfect for my daily run and commute on the bus because they blocked enough noise for me to use the lowest volume setting on my iPod and stayed put comfortably despite lots of movement. They only lasted about 9 months though. Running with them seemed to put them over the edge. The wire broke at the base of the plug and the sound in the buds would go in and out unless you held the cord a certain way. I would highly recommend them for use that requires no movement, but I don't know if I would buy another pair for my current uses, due to the fact that they didn't last very long."
1,Terrible Ear Buds - Do Not Buy,"These ear buds are terrible. After only a couple of months, both ear pieces fell off, which I glued back together. Then, after another month or two, the sound went out. Not good at all - do not buy."
2,"Sounds good, not good for running","earbuds sound and look great, great for the money. I ran with them consistently for about a month and then the wire connecting to my ipod came loose and now I only have sound out of one ear. I never dropped it or treated the wires with abnormal force. I can get the sound to come back if I clip the wire down with a paperclip but then I look like an idiot.be warned"
3,They're ok. Don't expect miracles.,"I've owned alot of earphones, so I have alot to compare these with. I wasn't expecting top of the line sound when I bought these, I just wanted a spare pair of earphones for the gym so that I didn't sweat all in my nicer stuff. These have filled that roll fine. They are lightweight and sound ok. They are way overly bassy, so much so that it interferes with voices and other mids. But for a pair to run on the treadmill with they're ok. Maybe a tad overly expensive."
2,"Great sound while it lasted, but it didn't last","I originally purchased these earbuds in March 2008. At that time, I thought they were a great upgrade to the iPod standard ear buds especially at the $25 price point. They stayed in place very well, kept out noise, and most importantly, had great sound.However, in June 2009, one ear developed an awful crackling sound which made the earbuds inoperable. My guess is that the wiring where it meets the earbuds is too flimsy to stand up to normal wear and tear. It's too bad because they sounded really great. I expected more than 15 months out of these earbuds, even at the $25 price point."
2,Not good for classical music,"I tried the V-MODA Bass Freq earbuds, and they do not have the treble clarity necessary for classical music. Their sound is quity tinny. While the Bass Freqs may be appropriate for some genres, the JBuds Hi-Fi Noise Canceling Earphones are the hands-down winners for classical music listening.If you're a classical/jazz audiophile like me looking for afforadble iPod earbuds, get the JBuds."
4,V-Moda Bass Frequncy earbuds,"At first glance these earbuds look no different from your average discount store earbuds. But from the moment you put them on and crank up your stereo or mp3 player the difference can definately be heard. The bass response is awsome for earbuds. I've read some reviews that states the lows and highs are non-existent, but for earbuds I felt the sound quality was pretty well balanced. I would have given these buds 5 stars but unfortunately the durability of the V-moda earbuds is begging for an overhaul. Expect about 3-5 months use out of them...unless you are the type to take pristine care of them."
2,Not as good as promised,"I spent days going over all earphones that were supposed to have extra bass, I decieded on this one and it was a mistake. It had nowhere near the bass sound that it stated in its presentation. I will continue my search for better bass reproduction from other brands of earphone makers."
5,BEST HEADPHONES YET!!,These are the best headphones I have had EVER!! They are cheaply priced but built with quality. The bass on these headphones are awesome and add a better sound to all my songs on my iPod. They're even better than the Apple headphones that come with your iPod. I would recommend these to anyone! I bought these a couple of months ago and they are still like new! I decided to go ahead and buy a pair for my friend for Christmas and she loves them!! I will not hesitate to purchase these headphones again!!
4,Short and Sweet,"There are already a ton of reviews on these so I will keep it simplePro: Sound absolutely incredible for under 20 bucksNegative: Durability sticks, I already broke 2 pairsI have moved on to bigger and better but if on a budget these are not bad."
2,Wasted $20 bucks,"I just received my V-Moda ear plugs. I purchased them based on the rave reviews but I guess you get what you pay for. I tried them immediately and first noticed how comfortable they were. Then I plugged them into my iPod Classic. First, I had to crank up the volume all the way. Then, I couldn't believe how cheap and tinny the sound was. I listened to Wasis Diop's 'Everything is Never Quite Enough' a good tune for rich textures, overlays and, of course, bass. I couldn't believe my ears. Plugged my old earplugs back in, the ones that came with the iPod, and had to lower the volume. Sure enough, it wasn't my imagination. The difference is unbelievable. A transistor radio compared to a symphony hall. Save $20. Find something else."
1,Avoid Vmoda,"The headphones do sound very good but if anything goes wrong your on your own. Vmoda will not stand behind there products. I learned this the hard way. Horrible customer service. Avoid vmoda unless you buy from them there is no warranty. They do not even attempt to resolve a issue, they are rude and I advice to try, Radius Atomic Bass they are in the same price range and they stand behind there products. AVIOD VMODA."
4,Great Sound. Good Price,"I tried the Bose IE's and returned them that very day because there was no improvement over the cheap KOSS Plugs that I had and they cost me 10x as much. Tried my roommates Sony MDR 51s... and those sounded muddy. Tried my old Panasonic headphones that came with an old portable CD Player... sounded fine but a lot of exterior noise leaks in. Got these babies, and the sound is great. Those complaining that it lacks mids and highs should A) Not shove them in too deep, B) check the Bitrate of your files... and C) check your ears for hearing loss (the high frequencies are the first to go)... These have definition and power. The bass sounds great. CNET gave them a good review, and I think its pretty accurate. I'm definitely pleased with these, except for their wires. I can see that these wires won't stand up to too much abuse. If you are running or walking, the wires probably will be fine. If you run the risk of falling down a lot (board sports) then these might not be for you."
5,Great headphones for the price!,Best bang for your buck in my opinion. Great sound quality and BASS!! The only downside is that the cheap price comes from less-than-top-of-the-line quality. I am about to buy my 3rd pair(after a course of about 2 years) but I think its worth it for the money and sound quality!!!!!
4,Excellent bass,This is a good product from V-moda . The bass quality is superb. I purchased 2 more after having purchased from Amazon . They noise reduction is also fine .
3,"Great sound, not so great fit","I just got my V-MODA Bass Freq earbuds and tried them out using my iPod. Listening to music or spoken word (book on tape) the sound is REALLY good. Very clear, crisp sound. Most outer noise is completely blocked out. This is fabulous! However, as I sit here not moving much the earbuds keep slowly slipping out of my ears. It is quite annoying. So I bet you think I have the wrong size silicone covers. Nope. Tried them all and small was the only one that fit. No my ears are not excessively small. I've never had a problem before. I suppose if you jam these suckers into your ear canal they may not move, but that is not an option. I am not sure what the outcome will be when I walk tonight and sweat while using these. I was hoping from all the reviews to love these, but alas I cannot if they do not stay in my ears."
2,V-moda bass freq,I bought these headphones for a sansa clip mp3 player. I am trying to use these while I exercise. The problem is they will not stay in my ears when I am running or jumping rope. I have tried every size fitting and the only one that fits in my ears is the smallest size and they still wont stay in my ear. Thats a big problem for me. I bought these headphones because they say they have extra bass which is good for hip hop music but I don't hear it. The sound does get muddled when you listen loud and the music sounds like its coming out a tin can at times. I would not buy these for the gym because like I said they will not stay in your ears. I don't know how they retail for 50 dollars. Thats just crazy.
3,Great sound .... but build quality is iffy,"I upgraded to these when my Colby earbuds failed due to the wire disconnecting inside the grommet near the pin. The V-MODAs sound much better than the Colbys and cancel surrounding noise well. They are also more comfortable. BUT ... just this week after about six months, the same failure occurred. Now I have to fiddle with the wire to make a good connection, but that won't do for long. I'll be looking for a replacement."
3,bass heavy,"these iems are super bass heavy. too much for my taste. it washes out most of the vocals due to its overpowering bass. i upgraded to the vibes which i find more enjoyable and cant be beat for the price. so if your looking for starter iems go with the vibes, its worth it"
2,"Blah, all I hear is the bass","I bought these based off of CNET's review. I can usually trust them but this particular review was way off. While the review depicted the bass as being a bit much, it is far worse. While listening to metal or rock all I can hear is the constant thumping, drowning out all the highs and mediums, as well as making the vocals muddy."
3,Kinda bassy,"First thing I noticed is that there are no real directions in the product packaging. It just says to insert them deep enough(!) into your ear canal to provide the ""optimal seal"". How is the average consumer gonna know when that is?When you finally find a comfortable fit, they work well, but they can be a little bassy if you insert them too far. Moderation is best with these.My last qualm is that they feel like I could break them if I coughed while they were in my ear. These things do NOT feel sturdy or rugged in any way."
2,"Sound was good, lacked durability under normal use","I bought these headphones after reading positive reviews on multiple reputable electronics review sites.They look great and are comfortable to wear. The sound is good, although I found the midrange to be a bit muddy. Bass definition is excellent, though.The problem was that after six months of normal usage (commuting via subway daily), one ear stopped working entirely. I came to find out that these earbuds use notoriously thin internal wires that are prone to breaking when flexed.With a little research there are alternative earbuds with great bass definition in the same price range that have better durability.Good luck."
1,Broke after TWO MONTHS!!!!!!!,"Stay away from these earphones please!!!!!!!! They are not very good for any person who relishes audio in any way. I picked them because of good reviews by CNET and when I got them I was very disappointed with the quality. I gave them to wife, because she isn't as picky as I am, and within two months of use the bass completely stopped working in the left headphone. Not worth the money at all."
3,"OK, but not great for working out","I have the ""Bling Bling Black"" Bass Freq's and they sound better than most of the earbuds I have tried. However, the rubber earpieces get really slippery when they're wet, so they slip out very easily when I work out. They're fine for use travelling, but I would not recommend if you will be using while exercising."
3,good sound but FRAGILE product,"I loved this product. The sound was great and the earbuds were very comfortable. BUT....be very careful with this product. My MP3 fell from my beltclip only one time while wearing the earbuds and the standup adapter bent in two! It snapped off completely. I expected these more expensive earbuds to be a little bit more sturdy than that. Again, great sound but very, very fragile."
1,Flimsy Cable...,"Pros:- Good sound quality (for me)- ...that's itCons:- Flimsy cable (The mfg should have just compare the quality with Apple's)- Bad design connector that stick out from my player (ipod) 1 1/2 inch, combined with the flimsy cable it will easily break the wire inside in time. Should design it as a low-profile L-shape or flexible connector.- Not sure about the copy right issue with Apple earphone, but the cable slider organizing thingy make sense and should include in most earphone design.Overall the flimsy cable and bad connector make me lost interest immediately."
2,Alright before they broke.,"So i had these for about a month, then the left speaker stopped working.. I then just listened to the right speaker but then slowly faded until no sound came out of either speaker... For the month they worked they were good, but I was not rough with these headphones at all and have no idea why they just stopped working."
2,Great while they last,"I am really disappointed I am back on Amazon after only using these on and off for 10 months. Considering I take very good care of my earbuds (do not bend the wires, etc.) I would NOT recommend these unless you want great sound for only a few months."
5,Family intrigue comes to the fore,"Family intrigue comes to the fore in Roberta Isleib's latest mystery starring professional golfer and amateur slueth, Cassie Burdette. Cassie is forced into the role of maid-of-honor in her friend Jeanine's country club wedding in swanky Pinehurst, NC. Cassie is supremely (and hilariously) unsuited to the traditional tasks of tending to the bride's gown and flowers, but she comes in very handy when the bride's father is kidnapped days before the wedding. She uses her knowledge of the golfing scene and her keen powers of observation to track down the errant father, uncovering some dirty secrets along the way. In the dramatic finale, Cassie's pluck and ingenuity save the day. Cassie continues to grow as a character and as a slueth--don't miss this installment of her adventures!"
3,Good summer read,"This is the first book in this series and by this author that I have read. It didn't WOW me, but it was pleasant reading for a balmy summer evening out on the patio. The writing is good enough, and the protagonist is human enough to be believable and likable enough that I will very probably read more of the series. As for the golf, I am not a golfer myself, but I have watched enough Masters tournaments and Dinah Shore-hosted tournaments over the years to understand what she was talking about. In any case, it isn't the focus of the story, it is really only the setting. If you like light mysteries with ongoing characters that you can get to know throughout a series, give it a try."
4,I need to get to Pinehurst,"Cassie and her merry band of misfits are at it again. I love the setting in Pinehurst and the re-occuring characters. The character development of the new cast of characters was probably edited, but it would have made for a juicier novel to know more about their backgrounds. The theme is a little more adult in nature this time around. More romance and disappointment amoung the characters. Islieb does a good job of showing character flaws and weeknesses."
2,funny idea,I bought this as a stocking stuffier. This broke very fast and its not meant for people with big hands.
4,Fun toy,"This flying pig worked exactly as I hoped. Our 4 year old grandson had a ball with them. Grandpa and I have so much fun playing with our grandson, aiming it and trying to get it where we wanted it to go. This is not a good toy for a home with breakable s, but it was great for us. And the dog enjoyed it too."
2,Junk,Very disappointed. Not like flying monkey I had bought before. Oink isn't. You don't get what you pay for.XXXXXXXXXX.
4,fun gag gift,"I have a friend who's obsessed with pigs, so this made a good gag gift. Conceptually its a good idea, but its actually hard make it fly. You're suppose to fit two fingers into the finger pockets on the pig's front hooves and then pull the back part and let go to make it fly. My fingers are average and they can't fit into the pockets very well. But for the price, this is still a fun toy."
1,Arrived dirty,"Even though it was in a plastic package, it was already quite dirty. Also, the sound didn't work, so no oinking. Obviously disappointed."
1,Broken the first time we used it,"My grandchildren thought this was a funny toy until they tried it out and the ""hands"" of the pig broke off on the very first try. Very shoddy. Do not buy this."
1,disappointed,I bought this as a prize for a party we were having for 9 year olds and the kids didn't play with it for very long at all before it started ripping apart.
1,Flying Pig,The pig was cute but there was not oink. Used it at a party and it flew around but disappointing that there was no sound.
2,Not Satisfied,"I ordered this as a mother's day present for my mother. Upon the first time we 'played' with it, one of the paws came off, and we couldn't get it fixed. I was very upset, that it broke that soon."
5,When Pigs Fly!,Length:: 0:06 MinsI love these slingshot animals! I got a monkey several years ago and loved it! My mom and I had a blast flinging it around. I gave her a flingshot chicken and this pig to a friend of mine. These are easy to fling. They also make excellent dog toys too.
1,Sling Shot Flying Pig Falls Short,"This toy is very cute, it is a fun concept however the toy broke with in five minutes with normal play. I would not recommend this toy."
4,Flying Pig,Very cute toy. Recommend for any pig lover. No problems with the seller or receiving the item in a timely manner.
3,For the pig collectors.,"This is a fun gag gift that I gave to a collector of pigs. Not much other purpose for it, but it does provide a few laughs."
2,Good for 2 seconds.,A gimmick toy. The hands of the pig was put on backwards so our pig can't fly. Unless you love pigs that make noises...there's got to be something else to buy besides this.
4,Don't Remember What I did with the Pig!,This was a great toy to toss around work when we had it. It flung pretty hard and made Oink noises while doing it. It was fun to fling into other people cubicle when they were not expecting it. The noise would give them some preparation but the toy has held up. Cannot remember where we put the pig las since it has been awhile since we last used it.
1,Junk,I was looking for things inexpensive for stocking stuffers and this was one of the items. I actually got two for two stockings. One held up for a couple of tries but the other broke on the first attempt.
4,Cute little pig. 10 year old nephew loved it.,Durable. Flies far. Wish the noise it makes were a little louder. Entertained 10 year old nephew for quite awhile.
1,Poor Quality,Flimsy and poorly made. The rubber tubing in the arm ripped off the second time my son tryied to use it
2,Hard to fly,"This item is much bigger than I had expected, which makes it harder to fly. I bought it for my son who can't make it go at all, even I have a hard time with it. He, however, loves it just the same without flight."
1,does not make nosie,The pig itself is cute but does not make sound like it should and is already tearing at the seam where it is stretched for slinging it as is it's intended use.
2,Difficult to use,We couldn't get the hang of shooting this pig. It was difficult to hold the sling shot part and pull it back.
2,Not Durable,Bought this for the kids and after shooting it 3 times the hand ripped off. Doesnt hold up.
4,Slingshot Pig,The product is great! I bought it for a contest at a hors eshow and everyone loved it! So much fun!
1,Slingshot Flying Pig With Oink Sound,"Slingshot Flying Pig With Oink Sound broke right off the bat with out any force was dissappointed..needs to approve, pigs sound was cute thou. would not sling very well thanks"
4,A bowl-side companion,"The UNCLE JOHN'S BATHROOM READER series presents collections of one- and two- page trivia that are perfect for reading when diversion is required.The PLUNGES INTO TEXAS volume focuses on a wide range of Texas lore, covering history, celebrity, food, politics, travel, and other bizarre bits of esoteric information. There are smidgens about the origin of Big Tex, the down-and-dirty personal life of Sam Houston, the ghostly cat who haunts the capitol, and the legality of dinning on road kill.From LBJ to Red Adair to ZZ Top, stories about the movers and shakers of the Lone Star State offer the reader quick snippets to amuse and entertain while other business is at hand. No Texas home should be without it."
3,Maybe better if you're not FROM Texas,"Like most Bathroom Readers, this Texas edition is pretty good. It's one shortcoming is that a lot of information gets repeated between various articles and footnotes. Some material has appeared in other Readers, so you might experience deja vu, but then again, you're probably on the can whilst reading this, so how much variation do you need?Texas has two years of state history in elementary school, so I know there's a huge well to draw from for a Reader book. I wish more was tapped instead of fluffing up the thin bits already in this book."
4,It's A Delight!,"For Texans it's marvelous,and for non-Texans it might be even better. It's funny and informative.It has Texas history, special events, and(perhaps,best of all) Texans' influence on other things - like the creation of Cicago-style pizza.Very enjoyable reading."
1,Has a hairline crack in it causing fluid leakage.,"The filter mount that I received has a hairline crack in the casting. I had installed it a while back under the truck on the supply line going from the transmission to the radiator and apparently it had a slow leak from the crack because I never saw drips under the truck in the driveway. However, 8000 miles and 3 months after installation I was 2.5 quarts low and my transmission was running much hotter than normal. I got under there with a flashlight and found a small leak on the top of the housing that was letting just a little oil out at a time when it was under pressure. Even after spraying the housing with brake cleaner to clean it up and taking a good look at it I can barely see the crack.Needless to say I'm replacing it with a different brand. I love the concept of auxilliary spin-on filters, but in this case a quality issue sullied my experience."
4,Sick and Dememted,"This was one of the most sick and dememted books that I have ever read. I was inflicting mental pain on myself with every sentence that I read ... but I couldn't stop. If you have a week stomach, stay away. If you want to read something more different than anything you have ever read, then here it is."
2,Cows,"I usually don't mind a book that is ""disturbing"" in subject matter, but this book was too disgusting in parts. Too much for me to keep reading it."
5,"If you wanna trip, pick up this stack of pages. One.","Crazy ass dude, crazier girlfriend, dominating momma, talking cows.SHIITTTT."
2,"Disgusting, yet dull","I don't really feel like this book pushes any particular envelope. Stokoe's scatalogical obsession gets pretty monotonous after a while and he just didn't have enough skill for me to suspend my disbelief in talking cows. He tries really hard to be shocking, but just succeeds in seeming desperate. Blah."
4,It Is Awsome!,It was a nice peice of music but there was no words! Other then that it was excellent!
3,Movie and soundtrack have much in common,"Perhaps it was just the fact that ""Insurrection"" came after the highly praised ""First Contact."" The opening theme was good enough but it didn't reflect 'Star Trek'.It was mushy and soft and reminded me of ""Good Will Hunting"" in its repetive softness and mushiness.However, it fit the occasion. I believe Goldsmith did an okay job with the limited material the film offered. Unlike ""First Contact,"" Goldsmith was unable to work with the powerful themes inherent to film of Star Trek's magnitude. Overall, the score fit the film i.e, it was soft and mushy but strangly appropriate. I think it is tough to top the opening track from ""First Contact"" and until a better film comes out, we will not hear another rousing score from Goldsmith."
3,Not the definitive movie soundtrack,"While this has some good tracks, it was purchased solely for the Baku village track, which is a delightful piece, and well worth listening to, especially if you're feeling a bit stressed.I obviously felt it was worth buying for that track alone, so if you liked the film, (which I did enjoy), but maybe can't remember what the music was like, try to borrow a copy to listen to first, before you splash your hard earned cash."
4,"Again, Goldsmith saves the Day!","Composer Jerry Goldsmith's third helming of a ""Trek"" film is a charmer. Both thrilling and poignant, this score enhances a rather routine story that is in need of some ""life"".While the music is not up to par with Goldsmith's classic scores (""Patton"", ""The Sand Pebbles"", ""Planet of the Apes"", ""The Omen Trilogy"" the first ""Trek,"" and ""Total Recall""), it is still a delight for fans and non-fans."
4,a symphony,From what I have heard from this I really like it. In the future I intend to purchase it because of the diversity in the music. I would recommend it to be added to anyones collection especially if your a star treck fan!
5,A Magical Score,"Star Trek Insurrection's greatness rests on one track that makes everything else worth while. ""New Sight"" is the most magical piece I have ever heard in my life."
4,Great score!,"Another example of a score that is much better than the film itself.I think that the film is the worst Star Trek movie...But the score is magic.It could have been 5 stars,but the score lacks more excitment."
4,star trek insurection,"One of jerry best yet it is more relaxing then the next one after this. I do hope they bring back to score the new star trek 2, that is comming out next year. As they brought back the original sound effects guy. why not Goldsmith as well"
4,Short but sweet,"At 45 minutes, this soundtrack is far too short. While not as memorable as First contact, the Insurrection soundtrack nonetheless has a good mix of softer, Ba'Ku themes and more martial fight songs. In fact, the softer songs are amongst the best of all the Next Generation films."
5,Very Good - could have Improvements,"I really like this album - Jerry Goldsmith does it again, this is one of his best albums he's done, lots of different themes, cues etc in this. Only wish there could have been more tracks on the CD & the music could have gone for over an hour. The movie goes for about 2hrs if that & the CD album only runs for roughly 45 minutes which should have contained more in it."
4,Target Eagle [VHS],I bought this movie because I was building a Max Von Sydow movie collection. It was an okay film worth watching.
1,When am I going to learn...,"I got this as an office novelty...something that might make my area more calming. Well, I guess I'll never know, as the thing shorted out when I added the water. So, my zen feeling really isn't realized, and I hope bad karma catches up to those that made this piece of junk."
3,Review,"Nice for a desk decoration. There isn't much noise from the water; the motor can be heard more than the water. The yellow paint was already coming off of the little stick used to move the sand around when the package was opened, which looks a little tacky now. The batteries go in the bottom of the fountain, so put them in before putting in the sand and water."
5,Verry nice,"This is a great way to relieve stress, had afew leaks when I first got it, but I soon cleared them up"
5,Might be the most important book since the Bible,"though there is some speculation on my part that the holy book in questions was actually written by aliens. I too, have been in contact with these people of the light since my first journey with them in 1993, which took me from the southen end of I-280, to a truckstop in Snow Shoe PA, off of 80. Ever since then, I have seen the influence on ETs in the human world. According to Martin, they have influenced our culture since our earliest days. We are still but primitives to them. This book is valuable to look at the course which the aliens will take throughout the rest of our history."
3,comedy value,"This guy is a big Quack but I had to read at least part of this book after seeing him on Howard Stern. This book has entertainment value but I wouldn't give much credence to anything the Author Says. supposedly ""Tan"" is the leader of a benign alien race that is going to come to Earth. The author was already on board Tans space craft and was ""uploaded pertinent information"" from the great tan whose full name is Oakwon Tanjuwon. I think this is one big joke. bmj2k's review of this book is also really funny..a friend added:The book is defently creative and entertaining, as is any fictional novel.You must believe in order to be saved. Oakwon Tanjuwon will take you on his spaceship and save you from the earth paradox in 2011. You're either with Oakwon or against him. Choose your destiny.On the spaceship you can also have sex with hot alien chicks, which riley has claimed to have done."
3,Scientology?,This concept is not very original nor is it as lucrative as it used to be. L. Ron Hubbard cottoned onto the idea of a science-fiction-based religion and made a bundle of money from the sheeple he attracted. It seems that Riley is barely able to make a decent living off of the same idea even with all the exposure he gets from the Howard media empire.The book has its funny moments but I had a hard time finishing it.
5,Works fine. Sounds great.,Works fine. Sounds great. Pretty sure I paid less than the $40 they are asking now though. No 21' cable is worth $40. $30 tops.
5,Looks good!,I am using this cable and it looks good! It was very expensive to purchase from Brazil because of the high taxes and freight costs. I hope it worth. Seem to that Monster cables are one of the best brands.
5,This Cable Will Save You Money!,"I used to by those 10$ cables, and went through about 3 or 4 of them within a year (due to solder coming undone by the jack). Finally I broke down and bought this cable, it was expensive, but I've had it for over 4 years, and it still rocking! I use these for gigs, and they are very reliable and durable. The sound improvement is great if you have a good bass and amp. They also help block out interference from computers and such. Get these cables, you won't be sorry!"
5,it is a great bass cable,well i've been a musician for over twenty years and i have been using monster cables for as long as can remember yes you do have to pay the price but they do build a great product monster cables are well worth the money.bass player]
5,Solid bass cable,"As soon as I opened the package, I could feel the quality of this cable. It's heavy, about 1.5 times thicker than a standard cable, and the connections are solid. Plugging this thing in to my bass and 100w amp provided a solid, clear, and powerful sound. Totally noticeable compared to a standard cable."
1,LEARNING,"The next editor that sees the phrase ""a little knowledge is a dangerous thing"" should incarcerate the offender.By misusing the phrase, you have hereby proved it.A little learning, people. Learning."
5,Will order from you again!,I purchased a regualator for my driver side window in my 02 Honda Accord. It arrived within two days after I placed my order and it worked perfectly. It also inlcuded the motor which saved me almost 75% after shipping and handling. I was able to pay approx $100 which included parts and labor. The dealer wanted $400. Thanks.
4,Delivered on time and works great,Easy to find the part I needed. Arrived earlier than promised. Part was an exact replacement and works fine.
5,Worked perfect in my 2000 Honda Accord 4Dr,"I cam out to find my window down one evening and it would not roll up. I could hear grinding noises and the window was obviously off the regulator. A quick internet search showed me a video on how to change it. A quick amazon search for the product and reviews. It arrived quickly and installed in no time. Highly recommended, saved me a ton of money."
5,Perfect Fit,"The item worked perfectly. Found some youtube videos online that made the repair easy, especially seeing that the door has a couple of holes you need to line up the bottom bolt to so you can use your socket to remove them and not have to try and use an open end/box end wrench inside the door."
5,The manual for US Coast Guard history and information.,"As a former Coast Guardsman, I can't say enough about this manual, which is issued to every recruit at boot camp. The information within is relied upon by members throughout their career from boot camp, where it is known as the ""Blue Book"", to paygrade advancements. If you need information on the roles the Coast Guard has played in history, vessel and aircraft specs and missions or even signaling, this is our basic source."
2,Needs to be updated,"I ordered this book because I was interested in transfering to the Coast Guard and wanted some general information. The book had a lot of information in it about the history of the Coast Guard, uniform and rank structure and such... However, since 9/11 the Coast Guard's mission has changed drastically and they now fall under the Department of Homeland Security. So, much of the information about the mission of the Coast Guard is outdated."
5,A great read,"I really enjoyed reading this book! It's very informative and if you're thinking about joining the Coast Guard, this book should be listed as your #2 on your to-do list when your #1 should be talking to a recruiter. I really breaks down the history, each ship, type of uniform, type of salute and more. This book is worth every penny!"
4,Want to see how much crap the USCG does?,Despite being Woefully always outdated this little gem is a fun read to leave in the WC for quick bits of random info. Thinking about getting another either really old version or maybe the newer version. I have the 1983 edition....
5,Worth it's weight in gold!,"I took this book and showed it to my recruiter and he said that it's weight in gold, and that after I was done reading it I woul be ahead of everybody else."
3,Book in good shape but missing some pages.,The book was missing about 18-20 pages in the appendix but other than that it was in good shape for the price.
3,A new edition is needed,"I was in the CG 20 years ago, but this book didn't really fill me in on what I've missed over the last two decades. This edtion of the Coast Guardsman's Manual is getting a bit long in the tooth, particularly in regard to the enlisted specialty ratings. Most of the aviation ratings are gone or have been consolidated and renamed yet you'll still find, for example, Aviation Structural Mechanic listed and described. It's the same with some of the other ratings also. With the demise of CW (Morse Code) 500kHz maritime distress watchkeeping the Radioman rating was changed years ago to Telecommunications Specialst. Its just a pity the CG didn't take away their ""sparks"" insignia and make it a cell phone instead. And one other thing... is the Coast Guard ever going to change that boring dress uniform? No wonder the vast majority of Americans have no idea that the CG is a branch of the military. The dress uniform makes them look like bus drivers!"
4,Mixture of Love and Magic,"This is one of those books that you have the feeling the author just put the word Magic in the title to get a fantasy reader's attention. The actual magic in the book is touched upon, but to me the book focused more upon the love of Faris and Tyrian. It seemed to me to drag in places, as though the author was really stretching to make it longer for some reason, and in other places she seems to rush and skim over areas (particularly when discussing the whole 'warden' issue), some of which are quite important. My favorite part of the entire book was definately the end, I'd say it's worth putting up with the minor unpleasantries simply for the ending, it's just masterful and stunning, not at all what I'd predicted."
2,Slow and dull,"I have enjoyed this author's collaborations with Patricia Wrede, so I decided to read her solo work. After having this recommended several times over the last year, I finally bought it. I was very disappointed. I like action, in reasonable places and amounts, and this book had almost none. The main character is to learn magic and save the world, and somehow,it still reads like a very dull diary. Even in the thick of the most pivotal action in the story, the tone is very staid and matter of fact.""And then I did this, and then he did that, and then I said..."""
5,"Stevermer successfully combines wit, romance, and suspense.","Stevermer successfully combines wit, romance and suspense into a brilliant and touching book. Readers fall in love with characters and the only dissapointment is that there isn't more to read once your done."
1,The WORST book I have ever read.,"The only thing keeping me from burning this book halfway through it was my streak of finishing every book I had read. (some get better as you go) But this one was truly terrible. The author followed no logical progression for the events and the magic was so weak as to be non-existant. Their was no clear plot. The setting of a Europe with magic, which could of been interesting, turned out awful. I would have burned the book when I finished it, but it was not mine so I had to return it to the library so some other poor soul could read this abomination. Worst book ever!"
5,Delightful,"In her book Caroline Stevermer takes a well known plot line (girl is normal ordinary, not very special, girl finds out she's magical and has to save the world, girl falls in love) and puts her own distinct twist on it. Stevermer's writing style is subtle. She doesn't shove details under our noses, she lets the reader figure out what's going on, and paints the world with hints dropped throughout the book. While some people may find this book difficult to understand at times, I thought that Stevermer's writing style was a kudos to intelligent readers out there."
1,Unreliable,"I thought this product had a great price and excellent features, and when it worked it was actually pretty excellent.My complaint though, was that it crashed very frequently. With each firmware upgrade things sometimes got better and sometimes got worse. I had to carry a paper clip with it so that I could reset it when this happened (which happened every day). The worst part of this is that it crashed most often when seeking, which I would want to do after the previous crash to get back to the part I was listening to. It was very frustrating.Finally, a few days after the warranty expired the system simply ceased functioning. It won't turn on, no response from plugging into the computer, nothing. It's dead.I was very sad to see it die, because I hoped they might eventually fix the crashing problem with firmware upgrades, and despite the crashing everything else was very good (good sound, pleasant interface, even had a line-in recording and built in microphone)."
1,"Creative's products have problems, Zen V is no exception","I bought this for my Dad as his christmas present becuase he said he wanted an MP3 player. For 100 bucks it was a good deal, or so I thought. After he installed the software, Windows kept on giving errors saying that the device wasn't connected or something was wrong with the hardware. After reinstalling the fireware on the device (Creatives support is really not user friendly) Windows still could not detect it. Since my Dad lost the box, I couldn't return it to the store that I bought it from.Like the last Creative product I bought, the Zen Mirco, I've encountered problems like no other. Save yourself some time and a headach. Look form something else OTHER then a Creative."
2,Flimsy and small,It is a nice little package - if you like small packages. The problem I have is the little toggle button in the front - They make it look like a dial in the pics - but do not be fooled it is a flimsy black toggle button. that is easily broken. The toggle is a two piece button that should not have been used.Spend a little more and get the bigger Zen or IPod
1,zen player,"the first one broke and did not workthe second one broke and did not work-all before I left the house-it wasted 3+hours of my time, I subscribed to music and still have not gotten another player.I was really disappointed -"
1,Read the reviews before you buy - then don't!,"Flimsy feel to the toggle switch. I bought it for the line-in recording capabilities, however the connector is too big for the connection on my stereo. The previous reviewer mentioned firmware issues causing problems when disconnecting from USB. This is what happened to mine; I am unable to reset it or fix it. There is a list of items on the screen including reboot, reload firmware (which erases what is installed, but then seems to provide no way to reload). I'm returning it, and will stick with my Sandisk red 256 mg player. This one has very simple drag and drop capabilities through windows explorer, or easy sync with media player. the Zen isn't as easy to transfer music to, at least compared to the Sandisk."
1,Would not recommend. Poorly made.,Bought two of these. One of me and one for my wife. On BOTH of them the middle button (the joy-stick button) broke off after only about a year. Making it very difficult to use. Not only that but if you try to fast forward a song it would completely freeze and we'd have to wait until it would run out of battery and shut off on its own in order for it to reboot and turn back on. I would not recommend this brand.
4,Better with at least 2G of storage,"The only drawback would be that if you really want to add videos to it,make sure you get one with at least 2G of storage or more.The videos are not compressed and therefore take up more space.The file size doubles when converted.I have had to reset the unit a couple of times but overall,I'm cool with the Zen V Plus.I like Creative's products and will likely buy another Zen V Plus player but I will get one with more storage."
2,TWO DAY WONDER,It worked great for two day's & then the screen went blank. I returned it for a full & quick refund. I then purchased a different brand(SanDisc)works great!
5,Good Product Good Price,"This wall plate was half the cost of the exact same thing at a brick and mortar store. Very pleased with the quality, price and shipping."
5,Cool Tool,I was working in a datacenter and got tired of manually using the tie downs. This inexpensive tool works great.Bought it in 2006 and it's still working great.
3,Sorry if that score offends some but...,"It is when listening to this album that I realise just how important it is that the rhythm guitars can be heard clearly. The song choice is fairly good, and the songs are played well, with real energy... but some of the studio recordings of some of the songs are more impressive, which isn't right.The main reason for this is the grossly undervolumed rhythm guitar, people don't realise, even with instrumental virtuosic music, just how important the rhythm guitars are, a lack of it destroys the whole band persona kind of feel for EVERY single song... Don't get me wrong, good album, if you like Satriani, buy the album.... just don't expect too much, the album is overhyped."
2,BASICALLY A WASTE OF TIME,"What's the point of putting out a double live album if all you're going to do is play album cuts exactly the same way? Yeah, it's nice to hear Joe play, but you could put his studio albums on, add an audience and you'd have the same effect you get on this set. You'd think a brainy guy like Joe would come up with some clever ideas that he hasn't expressed on record, or maybe play some obscure songs of other artists. Something, anything but note-for-note versions of his own stuff. Making matters worse, this is a very lame-sounding affair. Again, with Joe's digital wizardry I was expecting a very crisp, punchy sound quality. Forget it. This sounds like something recorded in the mid-80s. You know, set up the remote truck, use maybe 2 mikes and presto--live album. I still give it 2 stars because like another reviewer noted, the songs from EOC are improvements. Joe, you coulda made us proud."
5,Satch at his best Live,"For anyone familiar with Joe Satriani, this album serves up how great he is live, including a performance of almost all his greatest songs. For anyone who is unfamiliar with Joe Satrianis music, this album could be a great place to start, considering all of his great songs are on here and performed live spectacularly."
5,Amazing Album,Satriani is one of my favorite artists - quite possibly my absolute favorite. This album is a wonderful example of his extraordinary skills as a musician. It's a great place to start if you've never listened to him before.
4,Satriani for Seasoned Fans,"I am a long time, ""seasoned"" Satriani fan. If Joe cut a CD with eight variations of ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"" I'd buy it . On this recording, Joe plays a little outside the box -- something the seasoned fan will appreciate but the new listener may not. (New fans should try SURFING WITH THE ALIEN or TIME MACHINE) I do prefer a few cuts done in the studio compared to some done on this live recording, but for the most part, this is a must buy for any fan of Joe... and with over two-and-a-half hours of Satriani rippin' it up, it's the road trip CD of the year."
5,"I love it, once again!!!","I have ALL of Satriani's albums. This one, he plays good, real good, but different, well, it's live. To me, the songs sound good but just different. He does it again. He's the BEST I've ever heard, and this album proves it. If you enjoy this album, also pick up a copy of Crystal Planet another wonderful cd that will have you hooked listening for hours. I love this last CD. I bought it the first day it came out, and I'm not dissapointed. If you want to listen to Satch's latest, go grab one, and don't forget the DVD, coming up later......"
4,Went well with my black and silver buckle trench coat....oh yeah!!,Pretty nice accessory. Pretty fragile as well so keep it in an old glasses case if you want to keep it in good condition.
1,Gothic Vampire Glasses,"Glasses came shipped in a padded envelope and no other protestion. So when opened, glasses were bent out of shape. Poor packaging."
4,Cool,These are some of the coolest frames I own. I collect designer and fun frames and these definitely make my top 10. I've sported them only a couple of times and I've already received lots of postive feedback; friends and strangers like them a lot. They're COOL and a lot of FUN.
1,Arrived broken--very flimsy,"The glasses arrived broken--very flimsy metal is used for the frames. The design is nice, but the metal frames are unacceptably weak. I returned mine and won't be buying anything similar."
3,Cheap Quality + Poor Packaging = Trash,"These glasses came with very poor packaging, the frame was bent,and one of the nose supports was broken. The Seller needs to do something about it, since is not the first time it's been complaint about.They also look really cheap, I bought them as a Halloween costume accessory, but I don't think I'll be wearing them."
5,So beautiful!,"I received this album from a wonderful friend, after a lovely, lovely day. I play it over and over, each day it says more. I love the music,I love the artistry. The song For Once brings tears to my eyes. I end up humming it all day. Thank you for the gift of your talent. Thank you, Teresa J.Miami FL"
5,"Feels like Winter, Whispers Christmas","One of my favorites of the season. I'm especially likely to put this one on after Johnny Mathis and the Boston Pops have worn me out. It bears close listening, but can also shimmer in the background like Christmas tree lights. You'll play this one after the party is over, and the guests have gone home."
5,I'd give it 4 stars right away!,"I loved this book! It told me many new things about the underwater life (which I know tons about). It also challenged me to do a lot more thinking while I read. And wow! its by the SCUBA man himself, Jacques Cousteau!"
2,sopranos are too loud,"If you only could hear another recording of the Spem where you can actually hear the tenors pierce through the choir (see Paul Nevel's ""Utopia Triumphan"" recording), you would immediately find the Tallis recording to be unacceptable. And the Tallis Scholars' sopranos have almost always been LOUD and pinched especially in the high registers (in this recording and in many of their other recordings) ... they definitely do not sound angelic. If all you like to listen to are sopranos with the other voices as background noise then by all means continue to listen to this recording."
2,Don't buy this for the Spem,"Complete domination by sopranos in the Spem. How can 8 or 9 sopranos dominate 32 other voices in volume??? It's ridiculous. Despite the muddy sound, an old LP recording by Pro Cantiones was more inspiring than this recording. Get the recording by the Huelgas Ensemble instead if you want a recent decent Spem. I don't know about the other pieces on this disc since I sold my copy away 4 years ago."
5,Dora The Explorer doll,My granddaughter loves this toy. She plays with it often. It allows her to be creative without harming the toy as it is durable.
2,Teacher's Perspective,"I am a middle school reading/language arts teacher. Therefore, I am constantly reading titles to interest my students and bring into the classroom. I like the classics but bringing modern titles entices my students' reading palettes also. Anyway, I had high hopes based on these reviews that this was going to be a great one!-WRONG! This book was awful...as an adult reading it (thinking of kids) I couldn't get past pg. 20. Trust me the words are great! Perfect to teach words in context and larger vocabulary but the content is boring. What regular middle school student wants to read about two ex-smoking, ill aunts who are decorators? I don't even as a an adult. I know that the book goes on to discuss her illness and how they take a ""vacation"" to the beach..but there is no real excitement. Horvath-try again this one shouldn't have been a Newbery Medal winner."
2,Am I out of step?,"I read the book then I read all the reviews and I have to disagree with the praise heaped upon The Vacation. Horvath has taken her formula for success and applied it once too often. Instead of being eccentric and quirky, all the adults in this variation on a theme are just plain selfish and unpleasant. Even the Hallmark Moment at the end of the story can't redeem a tedious and pointless journey."
4,It's Math,"I am taking in online class and this was the required text book. It worked well for someone basically trying to learn this on her own. It give a lot of examples and lot's or practice problems. The only problem is, unless you have the teachers addition you won't know if your doing the practice problem correctly.This edition is supposed to have a code to get into: MyMathLab. An online course area that will tell you your doing it wrong, give you lots of practice, give hints, show videos and show pages of textbook to help you learn. My copy did not have this for some reason and I had to buy it on my own."
5,Fast Delivery,"This book is perfect! The shipping was fast, and the quality of the book is high. The Lial series of math books are wonderful, they have wonderful explanations, and are visually appealing. The books are made with community colleges in mind, but they work wonderfully for my 7th grade homeschooled child. Thank you!"
5,Great buy!!.,I needed this book for a class I took recently. The shipping was fast and accurate. The book was cheap and buying textbooks can be a tad bit difficult because they can be expensive. And the book was in great condition!!!
1,Coverage dated,"Who would think 1987 would look so dated? A few of the ""dwellings"" are amusing but the hippy look and scrap construction makes me think most photos were from the 60's."
3,Simple yet Satisfying,"This was the third book I read of Mrs. Brown. I wasn't blown over, wasn't wowed or anything, but I wasn't disappointed either. It was simple, yet endearing. I too am a single mother of two lovely children, and have been accused of being too reserved and uptight, so could relate to Elizabeth's character. (I can also enjoy a good daydream now and then) It's a good read, not her best, but good just the same. If nothing else, you have to read it just so you know how it all began when you read `Adam's Fall', which IS one of her BEST! ...2.5 Stars"
3,This is Sandra Brown!?,"After reading loads of her current books, I slowly found myself going back into time to read her more older books, and boy were they old! More sappy and happy endings, not much suspense, lacked in plot. I kept thinking, ""This is the pre-Sandra Brown?! IS this even her writing?""Even though this book was simple compared to her power packed contemporary trash, this was quite lovely."
1,Fraudulent Author,"Without considering author John C. Maxwell's background, I found Equipping 101 to be informative and insightful. Filled with quotations and life stories of great leaders, Maxwell did a great a job piecing together a book of other people's accounts on the topic of leadership and equipping. However, I don't understand how an esteemed pastor could write a hundred pages on leadership and equipping leaders without mentioning his own personal leader, or referring to the book he claims to believe. Perhaps the book hold more weight had it been written by a successful Fortune 500 business owner, instead of a pastor using his success in the Christian church to try to teach on corporate success."
2,Very Disappointing,"I bought this software to replace an old Visual Home software I have had for many years. I will probably uninstall Punch and re-install Visual Home because Visual Home is much easier to work with. Also, my old software has much better kitchen and bathroom fixtures, furniture and at least offers more garage/shop items to place in the model. The only advantages to this Punch software is the deck design and the fact that you can design additional floors over the first floor footprint. I have not gone as far as using the furniture workshop and the RealModel--I don't think I will waste my time. This WAS NOT money well spent."
2,Disappointing,"I used an older version of Sierra before we built our addition and loved it. Lost my cd & couldn't find another so I bought this. Maybe some features are better but many are disappointing.The accessories selection is poor and the ""walk-thru"" feature much less flexible and difficult to use."
1,No Plant Elevation Capability,Don't buy this product unless your yard is totally flat. You do not have the ability to elevate your plants therefore they end up below ground.
5,"A few limitations, but better than the rest","First I tried Broderbund total 3D home. Big mistake - I'm still waiting for my refund. Unless you want square, pre-designed rooms that don't connect, leave it on the shelf. Then I tried Punch 5-in-1. Within a half hour I had an entire floor design complete, with the dimensions I wanted, something the other brand didn't even support. I added a basement, second story, roofs, stairs, etc. easily and accurately.Downsides: the topography tool is somewhat limited, and a custom roof feature would be a big plus - but it's so much better than anything else out there (in this price range) that I gave it 5 stars."
4,Wow! Easy to use and powerful,"I'm really impressed. I just poped the CD into the drive;installation came off without a hitch. In half an hour I had sketched out my home's layout, done some basic landscaping added a deck and made a quick 3D tour. All this without touching the manual! Another half hour later and I had colored walls, furnishings standard and custom. The tools are really straight forward."
4,Good comprehensive product,"I've used this product and the Broderbund suites and have definitely been pleased with this one. This product gives me the flexibility i want for doing design work. I've used the program to create a model of my home -- its working fine. Has a topography tool, which I've used to sketch my backyard. Even has a user support site.My only major complaint? The undo functionality is highly limited. You might accidently erase a wall thinking you can undo it -- think again."
5,The first of many,This was the first Tallis Scholars CD that I bought back in 1985 and I have been hooked on them since. In my opinion the purity of their delivery is unmatched by any other Renaissance ensemble and this is a fine example. Glad to hear that Gimell is now back in private ownership and freed from the constraints of a big label.
2,"The older version had more features, unlimited access","I purchased this program first in 1998. It was outstanding as a sales lead tool. You could input the SIC (Standard Industrial Code)and retrieve listings of business leads. You could then import them into Streets Plus seamlessly, and it would generate a map with how ever many businesses you saved in your worksheet. This produced a ""connect the dots"" travel route on one page, and made it unbelievably easy to plan a sales day filled with 10 - 12 calls, with the most efficient route. ""Windsheild time"" was cut down by about 70%. Unfortunately, they dropped the mapping feature on this latest version, and they also now limit the amount of leads you can actually access to about 3,000 which is a hummingbird egg compared to the old ostrich egg. The remaining names have to be purchased through a download at an unreasonable price in my opinion. What a shame. I am now in search of another program."
4,Good Telephone Tool,The purpose of purchasing Select Phone was to have a source for multiple listings in specific regions. Select Phone delivered. It is easy to use and the geographic target and neighbor search features made it a bargain. The only draw back is the limit of 2500 records for the software when exporting. Additional records must be purchased thru customer service at InfoUSA at 8 each.
2,Book isn't really about Jefferson,"This book suffers from the common Wills characteristic of rambling. You'll learn about Tim Pickering, Aaron Burr, J.Q. Adams, but I thought the book was about Jefferson. Most of the book isn't about Jefferson at all, except the concluding paragraph of some chapters that try to address the central thesis. There's nothing new about Jefferson in this book. Someone could write a great book about Jefferson's blatant hypocrisy on slavery. Wills certainly didn't do it with this big disappointment."
3,"Provocative title, but doesn't deliver","We are using this volume in a class on Jefferson and the early 1800s. The class finds it redundant and disorganized.The provocative title takes a bit of unraveling, but once you do there is less to it than imagined. While ""Negro President"" may have been a term by which Jefferson was described by his enemies back then, it means something quite different today.Finally, The book seems really to be about Thomas Pickering, not Jefferson, with many chapters titled ""Pickering and . . . "" Perhaps he should have been named in the title. But then, of course, who would have purchased it?"
2,Misleading title - too much about Pickering's personality,"With Jefferson on the cover and a provocative title like ""Negro President"" you'd think the book would be all about Jefferson.........but instead, it's mostly about Timothy Pickering's fight with pro-slavery forces during his time in Congress. Not an unimportant topic by a long shot, but I was expecting Wills to tease out the complexities of Jefferson's mind on the subject of slavery."
4,Ms. Pac-Man has her own world,"Ms. Pac-Man Maze Madness is a send-up of Pac-Man World, only this time, it's on a maze format. The newer version of the 1981 aracde game features ghosts, enemies, and blocks to move around, plus the arcade mode is the best one. Ms. Pac-Man be da bomb!"
3,Too Spooky,"The game is fun, don't get me wrong, but I could do without the constant ""muuuuhhhahhaaaa"" (attempt at a Count Dracula sound) all through the game. There are vampires that turn into bats and other things that I think make this game scary -- if I had children, I would not let them play it."
4,A good sequel to Pac Man World: 20th Anniversary,"When Namco released Pac Man World, it was a fun game. It was a 2D platform game in 3D that retained the spirit of Pac Man. Well, Ms. Pacman Maze Madness is just like Pac Man World with Ms. Pac Man instead of Pac Man. The graphics are bright and colorful adn really add to the experience. The control is tight and dead on. The only problem with the game is that it can get repetitive and boring after a while. As an added bonus, there are some multiplayer modes which can be quite fun as well as the original version of Ms. Pac Man. If you liked Pac Man world, this game is a must buy. As for everyone else, you won't be disappointed if you buy it."
4,Pleasing to the senses,"The game play is a lot like the original, but prepare for your senses to be pleased. The various settings are graphically fascinating, the various creatures are neat and fun to go against, and the music is well done! It is a very basic game so do not expect much innovation in game play, but if you enjoyed the original and appreciate great visuals/music then this game is worth it."
4,Merengue,"I like it because the whole album is good.For people that like merengue buy this album.Beautiful songs,good artist.One of the best merengue singers."
5,"Milhouse ""A Band To Watch For""","Milhouse has a sound all its own. Listen to the words and they are as intriguing and enteresting as the music. Beyond Alternative and deep into your heart and soul. Fascinating melodies and powerful guitars. On the edge of a new music, yet including such a variety of music on one CD. It is definitely not the repeat of the same sounds and songs of a CD that you grow bored with fast."
4,GREAT SEXY SHOES***Need some 'breaking in',"I bought the black is these shoes as I ABSOLUTELY adored how sexy they looked online!...I must say I got many compliments the first days I wore them (And trust me they were so nice they HAD to go with everything in my warbrobe!) The quality is good, I have had no troubles like the person before. To be very honest with any fellow buyers however, I would advise that they DO take about 2-3 days to 'break in' and stretch a little before they become totally comfortable. So if you have to do alot of walking or standing on your job, I wouldn't recommend this shoe. Definitely makes you feel more sexy and looks GREAT with just about anything!"
2,Hang on to your cash,"Pros: The build quality is decent, for the most part. The primary and secondary seem to be good quality. The equatorial mount is decent enough. Cons: The viewfinder is plastic garbage. Additionally, the built-in corrective lens (housed in the focuser) used to increase the focal length makes the thing impossible to collimate. You can take it out completely (it screws out thank goodness), which is what I've done. Should be able to collimate it now, at least. I plan on leaving it out entirely, as it seems to be the primary complaint with the quality of this scope. I will come back with more info later, after I see if this makes an improvement. With the lens in? Moon...yes, planets galaxies, etc...no. Better choices are dobsonians from the big three...Meade, Celestron and Orion."
2,This is pretty low quality,"It didn't close quite right. With a little bit of bending and forcing of it, it got a bit better. The handle was also a bit loose. Cheap, but also cheaply made."
2,not made U S A,try to buy amarican made products but almost all you can buy junck? from imported that would not know quilty. it a shame all we crap from china no wonder U S A ia a mess with sub-grade products. all the imported garbage we get shoved at us lacks quility- pride
1,Unable to get on line,"I have used this since Apr 2001. Worked fairly well when I had a local access number. In Sept, they switched to an 866 (toll free) number. I have not been able to get on line since then."
3,"If you like Durango Saloon, then you'll love Santa Fe Trails","While Durango Saloon showcases Elman's unique piano styling and hints at his musical connection with the ""Cowboy Mistique,"" his Santa Fe Trails CD goes the whole nine yards, giving old familiar hymns a cowboy treatment that is not only unique, but full of rollicking energy. Santa Fe Trails will quicken your pulse, pique your nostalgia, put a smile on your face and keep you awake and alert on long, monotonous drives. Unfortunately, the CD is out of print, but it deserves to be re-released."
4,"Imaginative, Defies Categorization","Haunting melodies richly illuminate our own memories of Saturday afternoon westerns. When you have devoured the entire CD, you'll swear you been there!"
5,Outstanding family stocking stuffer,This was just what I needed for an inexpensive Christmas stocking stuffer. It met all my expectations and even more
5,Very cute movies,I got these because my kids love dogs and I was hoping they would be good. They were very cute movies. Great for families.
1,THE DESCRIPTION IS WRONG!!!,There isn't a bit of leather in these shoes. THESE ARE COMPLETELY PLASTIC SHOES! I wouldn't have bought them if I'd known they were plastic.
5,Very real and very harsh,"I second the other reviewer's advisory on the description on the back of the box. The story is about two men who grow up together in a monastery. One becomes a soldier and ends up losing his status as such, when he marries a witch who'd borne him his son. The other becomes the Prior in a monastery.As you watch, you see the adversity between Catholics and heretics growing. Zeal to get rid of all the heretics creates an almost unquenchable fire. First, there are advisories. Then there are bounties. Finally, you better turn someone else in or the Church is coming after you.The costuming, set, and acting is very real--perhaps too much so, but ""Shadow"" is good instruction for us in this time as to how a Holy War and Purge are conducted. Very worthwhile film--but a difficult watch."
4,I ONLY used this book to study for the December 06 exam...,"...and I passed the CISA on my first attempt.I suppose nothing's perfect but I bought it in August of '06, broke down my study so that I would complete it a couple of weeks before the exam and then walked through the book week-by-week. I then retook the tests several times as I went through and felt fairly well prepared by the time I got to the exam.I found more errors on the exam (Chinese sample questions?) than I found in the book.I highly recommend it."
3,Good except - watch for exam answers,"I am less than halfway through the book but came back to write a review because I wanted to warn people of the exam questions/answers.I think the book is great and there are hundreds of prep questions through the cd and book. HOWEVER, I found at least 2 cases so far where the answer letter is wrong. The description of the correct answer is correct, but the actual letter does not match that answer. Be careful."
2,Wife failed the CISA,"Well I didn't read it but my wife used this for her CISA and failed, Yes, Yes..it may be her problem, but since her qualification is an MBA from a premier school and I noticed her study hard, I am going to blame the book."
3,Passed,"I used this in combination with the Official questions and answers book. Passed the exam with a fair margin. If you do not have an IT audit background, I would not try to ""test first""."
5,good review guide,"I caveat this review with the fact that I haven't taken the exam yet.This book along with CD (containing PDF version of book, flash cards and sample exams) seems complete. It goes through alot of detail and includes diagrams to help explain the concepts. I believe it will be the key resource in helping me pass the exam."
5,Real World Auditor Training,"Not only will this book help you pass the CISA Exam, but you will gain a true insight on what is expected of a true practitioner. In combination with the instructor led calsses offered by CertTest, the preperation for the CISA exam was incredibly thorough. Book is well written and very relevant."
2,Not for CISA exam!!!!!!!,"It is too general and may be a book you can suggest for auditors, but not for the one who wants to pass the test."
1,Would not read it,Read this book and feel it doesn't help in studying for the CISA exam in anyway. but its a good book for leisure.
3,Easy Reading But Poor Editing,"I purchased this book to study for my CISA Exam, based on the fact that Sybex produces good self study packages. It was easy to read, and the authors placed a lot of emphasis on giving you useful tips about exam preparation and the practical aspects of IS auditing.The problem that I found was that the text was so full of mistakes - there were grammatical mistakes, mistakes in diagrams, mistakes in explanations, mistakes in answers to questions ... Having a strong IT background but not being an IS auditor I could not be sure if the information relating to the auditing was correct.I would not recommend this as your only source for CISA exam prep - I ended up using Allen Keele's Online CISA Review and the ISACA Exam Questions CD-ROM to help me prepare as I really was not sure of this book.The ISACA Exam Questions CD-ROM was just excellent.The exam is hard, so I would advise anyone preparing for it to prepare very well."
4,Great Book for Targeted Learning,"The CISA exam is written in a way to reflect the choices an auditor faces. What's best, what's the most preferred, etc., tend to be the types of questions one faces. (The CISA exam is not going to ask the test sitter, what is the best in a given environment, as that would be too ridiculous to measure.) As such, people often find the test confusing, because they want to read too much into the questions.I picked this book up the week before the CISA exam and targeted my reading toward those areas in which I had the least experience (e.g. SDLC, etc) and I passed. That was it! Although not perfect, the book is readable and focused. There are some decent example questions at the back of the book that will prepare one for the types of questions on the test."
4,"Good book, used it and passed Dec 2006 Exam. I am a CISA thanks to this book","Good book, used it and passed Dec 2006 Exam on my first attempt. I am a CISA, thanks to this book.The details are just what you need, the authors a did a good job, i recommend it to my brother and friends for Dec 07 Exams, and i talk about it to whoever care to listen.A book does not need to be a hard core to be good, simple easy and straight forward that is why i like it. it gives you the details,it is a good manual."
2,Good for understanding the topics - Not for passing exam,"Read the book. Then I ordered the manual and questions. Basically the book did not help me answer the practice questions. If you want to pass the exam, get the manual and practice questions. If you want to learn some practical industry tips along with the broad understanding of topics, get this book."
2,"This book was a ""fair"" study guide","I purchased this book to use it as an additional study resource for the CISA exam, and to also learn more about IT Auditing. The book does a pretty good job of explaining who/what/why/how of IT auditing. However, I just took the CISA exam today and tried to recall what I read in the book, and wasn't able to carry over much of the books material to the actual exam. Don't get me wrong, this book does provide good insight into IT audit, but doesn't really prep you for CISA exam (oh by the way, the official ISACA study materials don't really prepare you for the exam either in my opinion). I think this book should be titled ""Basics of IT Audit"", or something similar, rather than being touted as a ""CISA Study Guide"". Good luck on your exam!"
4,"Good study guide, but not enough for the exam",I took the exam two weeks ago and did really good. I would recommend studying ISACA's CISA review questions in addition to this book. Reading this book alone will not help you pass the exam. The concepts are well explained but the questions in the book are nothing like the ones in the exam.Good luck
3,Not enough,"I think this material was not enough to be ready for the CISA test. Normally I buy books from sybex and I'm pretty satisfied, but in this particular case I think this book did not cover PMI, CMM and other management methodology required by the test in certain detail in order to let you be prepared."
5,"emerging, sizzling Italian rock","2cd live recording, plus 3 brand-new studio tracks.The very Italian emerging rock-band."
4,"SubsOnicA - ""THE POWER OF LIVE""","Sono certamente il miglior gruppo del panorama musicale italiano, riconosciuti finalmente, dopo tanta gavetta, anche a livello internazionale. Possono vantare un tiro dal vivo che è proprio solo dei grandi artisti, arrivando a coinvolgere il pubblico con atmosfere intensissime e alienanti a sfruttando il carisma e la carica trascinante del frontman Samuel.Quest'album è lo specchio dell'evoluzione sonora dei Subsonica che raccolgono in 2cd il meglio dell'Amorematico tour 2002."
3,Tallis English Anthems,"Well performed, marvelous music but disappointing sound quality, hence the 3 star rating."
1,Why bother?,"Why cheat us of the original, COLOR version??? as much as I would love to see this, along with the other primitive talkies, I won't buy something that is less than half there... Fie for shame..."
1,"Doesn't work, No customer service","I primarily got this software in order to burn CDs. The only problem is that it does not recognize my CD-R/RW. I went to their websight for help, and all there was was a place to send an e-mail. Well I sent an e-mail telling Macmillian what was wrong. I didn't hear back from them so I called their tech support line, I waited on hold for TWO HOURS, and still never got through to a person. I finaly got a reply for my e-mail today, a week after I sent it, and they told me I needed to download an update. I downloaded it, but when I try to run it it says I dont have the software on my system and shuts down. This has just been one head-ache after another."
5,The most tumultous year on paper in poetry and pictures,"What a great book! Almost as good as Tales! The way it's all written, and the pictures he draws along with them, and all the emotion and experience were shoved into this book, mking for a great read. I DEFINITELY recommend this for anyone trying to find a concise and well written book about the hippes, yippies, Abbie, Ed, Jerry, Fugs, or anything else that went down during that great year. He writes about the Chicago and the Democratic Convention superbly!"
3,Poor support via email & phone #'s don't work,"Tv is ok. The problem started when I lost the remoteduring a move. Emailed support requesting remote code.Reply was we ""don't know the code"" but if you point auniversal remote @ Tv it will learn the code (wrong!).I decided to call all three phone numbers from web sitedo not work. Emailed support requesting a phone number thatworks no reply.Anyone have the code? Pacco has'nt a clue."
5,Christmas is a time of giving,The text and illustrations in this book are charmng. It really gives meaning to the Christmas season and the joys we can share.
1,Gave my dog horrible diarrhea twice...,"We have a tiny little 8 lb maltese, and we got him the mini size bag of these. Each time we give it to him, he seems to love it, but he had HORRIBLE diarrhea that led to multiple vet visits (it was awful, pretty much the worse diarrhea he's ever had at age 3). I noticed about 8 hours after he ate the nutrident, the diarrhea started and it had turned blackish green. Fast forward 2 months, and our dog was nursed back to health and happy...I didn't think that the nutrident was the cause of the diarrhea earlier, I thought it just made it worse so I gave him another one. Wrong. About 6-8 hours after, I noticed his normally firm stools were extremely soft and once again, they were blackish green. I promptly threw the entire bag in the trash. Terrible product and I will never be buying these again. As a side note, my little guy tolerates and loves Greenies just fine. I'll pay the extra few bucks for the Greenies to make sure he isn't food poisoned by these ever again."
3,Expensive! Huge increase in price.,"My dogs are absolutely crazy about these; they're like crack for dogs. I last purchased some in Fall 2010 for $14 for 24; then we decided to take a break from them for awhile to ease the addiction. Feeling soft, I thought to purchase some again. Now, less than a year later in June 2011, they are almost $20 for 24. That's an outrageous price increase in a short amount of time. Yes, those of us who have dogs love our dogs, but I feel like our love for them is being taken advantage of. I can only imagine what the profit margin is..."
3,Not as Pictured,"The items arrived but are not as pictured. They are clear and are not in plastic wrap. From searching the web, they are better pictured on Jelly Belly's site as Jelly Belly BigBean Dispenser. I have not opened the jelly beans so I can't speak to anything other than packaging."
1,"Stupid, but not enough so as to be funny","I typically like the zombie genre, and I thought I might like this. Yes, the special effects are campy. The plot is stupid; there's no attempt to get the viewer to suspend their disbelief. BUT I thought it might be stupid enough to be funny. However there wasn't any part of the movie that struck me as funny. I watched the whole thing thinking the finale might make the movie worth the time already invested in viewing it... wrong!"
1,Total Crap,"Even for a cult movie, this was total crap. They should've saved the $500 in production costs. Not worth the time it took to load it from Amazon."
1,"Really poor zombie movie. Not even typical. Just poor. so sad, as I do enjoy a good zombie flix.","Very disappointing movie. The story line was poor. The acting was poor. The effects were less than poor. I do enjoy a good zombie movie, but I do like a little terror thrown in for kicks. A high school production would have been just as good.It was suppose to be funny, but that even fell flat 99% of the time."
1,Did I see the same movie as the other reviewers?,"I don't expect a zombie movie to be perfect, but I couldn't get through this one without fast fowarding. The biggest issue was total lack of common sense. Yeah, it's a movie so you expect that some liberties will be taken, but when a guy squeezes off about 30 rounds with a six shooter it's just TOO illogical. The production quality was poor, the story jumps around, the actors are annoying. I just didn't enjoy it, and I like a lot of cheesy zombie flicks. If you have a Japanese fetish maybe you'll like it, but otherwise I would skip it."
2,Heel falls apart,"These boots look nice and fit pretty well. I bought them because the price was right - but after wearing them for 2 weekends (outdoors) the heels are both falling apart -- the grip on the bottom fell off of the left boot the first day, and after the 3rd day the grip on the bottom of the right boot was gone as well. This allowed rocks to be wedged into the resulting hollow and ruined the traction on flat ground. Yes, they're cheap - but not cheap enough to fall apart so quickly!"
5,Champagne for Caesar,"This movie is a rare gem which is rarely (if ever) shown on TV. Ronald Colman and Celeste Holm are superb, but Vincent Price literally gives one of the funniest performances ever filmed -- he's absolutely wonderful. For all fans of Vincent Price in his ""horror"" films, this movie is a must see just for the sheer joy of watching Mr. Price in one of the funniest and nuanced roles of his career. I absolutely adore this movie."
5,Champagne For Caesar,"This is a classic comedy with Ronald Colman, Vincent Price, Celeste Holm and Art Linkletter. A genius tries to put a show out of business to help his own financial problems. Celeste Holm is hilarious as the woman who tries to distract Ronald Colman from winning."
5,An oft-missed comedic gem,Colman and Price clash wonderfully in a class of comedy rarely seen these days.A must have for fans of either.
3,CAESAR THE PARROT,"A self-confessed genius (Colman) with a grudge against a soap company determines to win an astronomical sum on the company's weekly radio show. Ronald Colman and Celeste Holm, usually joyous in comedy, struggled here to make bricks without straw under the direction of Richard Whorf. The film is notable, however, in being one of the very first to recognise Hollywood's new rival, television, though its real target is quiz shows, which were outstandingly popular on both TV and radio at the time. Colman plays a mastermind who enters a quiz show; Vincent Price is very funny as its pretentious and humourless sponsor. An agreeable little diversion which unfortunately tends to peter out during the second half. Not a huge success at the box-office, since the stars sued the producer (Harry M. Popkin) for their deferred fees."
2,no champagne for caeser,the tape had some static but it was possible to watch this film. what i didn't like about this film is vincent price was not the star
3,"Good, but Ridiculous","Champagne for Caesar is not a bad movie, but it felt to me that it went on too long. And, I am a fan of films that deal with the ridiculous, (Bringing Up Baby) but funny! This film just didn't do it for me. I bought it because with the cast, I thought it would be great. NOT - while I enjoyed all the cast, it couldn't make up for what I consider to be a weak script. I am a very knowledgeable Silver Screen movie watcher and I love just about all of the films from that time. This one is something to rent, not buy."
1,No fizz here,"Looks like I'm in the minority here, but I thought ""Champagne for Caesar"" was quite a disappointment. The plot concerns a genius going on a quiz show and mopping up. Now, I like both Ronald Colman and Vincent Price, but this was just too awful for words. Colman deserved much better than this paltry vehicle."
2,"Picture is fun and smart. The sound, just awful.","""Champagne for Caesar"" was a film I saw in my early days of film going. I've always remembered it as a smart and funny film, especially notable for Celeste Holmes sophisticated turn as Ronald Coleman's charming nemesis and Vincent Price's off-the-wall performance as the eccentric manufacturor of ""Milady Soap, The Soap That Sanctifies.""I looked forward to this DVD but must report that technically it falls too far short to recommend. About a quarter of the way into it, the sound turns extremely harsh and is almost unlistenable. Later still, intrusive scratches and smudges-- that surely could have been eliminated--suddenly intrude, spoiling the moment.""Champagne for Caesar"" remains a charming romp but not in this presentation."
2,Bad transfer,"I won't go into the story line as others before me have covered that. Let me instead deal with the quality of this DVD. It stinks! Mainly because of the sound. At points it sounds like the actors are talking under water. At first I thought I had a bad disc, so I returned it for replacement, but got the same problem. So I wrote to the company that put this out on DVD and this was their response: Thank you for your inquiry. We are sorry to hear that you are disappointed with your latest Image Entertainment purchase. Unfortunately the problem that you are describing concerning the soundtrack of this film is the result of damaged film stock. Image Entertainment made three attempts to find the best available master for this film and the finished product was made using the best remaining film stock available.Bottom line is, buy this ONLY if you can't do without this film. Otherwise there are lots of other wonderful films on better DVDs."
5,Everything you need to know to survive the millenium change,What will happen if the computer gurus don't fix all those Y2K computer bugs? Will your credit card work? Will you have enough heat? Will your phone work? Dr. Kessler explains all in this much needed book for the millenium.
5,"Good info, nice style","This is quick reading, and time well spent. Until I read ""Your Year 2000 Survival Guide"" by Jackie Kessler I hadn't thought too much about how electrical outages and food supply chain glitches would impact my family in Arizona. I knew home heating wasn't an issue but I didn't think about a freezer full of food spoiling in our warm climate. Now I am getting my home prepared for any emergency from an earthquake to Y2K with non-perishable food, adequate water, safe lanterns and a reasonable supply of pet food for my pets (probably pet food will be shipped last if there are fuel shortages). I also think her advice about getting hard copies of important documents and keeping a second set out of the house just plain common sense. I appreciate the checklists, timelines and exercises."
3,Eh...,"Good quotes, thought it was odd that there were pages with absolutely nothing written on them. Although my friends and I took that as an opportunity to write in our own quotes for the birthday girl."
3,Weak on Forms,"This book gives a good overview of what you need to know on the exams but does not go in depth enough to cover the tough questions given on the real exam. The explantions are vague and not enough detail. Didnt use it for the first two exams but was definetly not enough for the iz0-121 exam , i did not pass. Thinking about going the release 6i route and take the internet developer exams instead with the book Internet application developer exams I and II. The release 2 , formsI, formsII, and reports are being expired anyhow."
3,Provides High Level Information about the Exam Contents,"The exams are much more complex compared with the explanation given in the book as well as sample questions. Author has tried to cover everything but not in detail, which does not really help in passing exam. After reading from the book as well as solving all questions thoroughly still you cannot pass exam then it will be disappointing for anyone. So I used this book as a reference, having provided information what are the topics I have to study and having matched with material given by Oracle to check what is covered in exam. I have also used Oracle Online manual help which provides most of the information you required to pass these exams as well as SelfTestSoftware as a good source to know the exact complexity and test questions that you are likely to get in the real exam.The book will drive you to your destination however I am not sure whether you will reach to your destination or not."
4,"A very good book, but not the perfect one","I got this book some six months back and starting preparing for the OCP ( Developers Track) and I must tell you that this book will help you very much in your prepartions for all the 5 exams. Yet there are a lot of things that this book does not supplement good. For example in the Reports Exam , the concepts were not explained in detail. For example there was no section featuring enhancement of matrix reports which has heavy weightage in the exam. Also, the CD which comes with the book has only those questions which we find at the end of the chapters, the authors could probably put some other questions in the CD so that the person who is preparing for the exams can be given some more examples for practice. But over all, this book has been very good especially the coverage for the forms exams was simply too good.I think if you are serious about OCP ceritication then you should definetely have this book on your table.Thanks,Ranganath."
3,Are these two real authors?,"The book is not well thought out or organized at all, is hard to read and get the information you need out of it and appears to be written by high schoolers. It seems most of what you need to know to pass the test in in there though. Still, Oracle should be ashamed of themselves for printing this."
4,enough for the cert ...,"I bought this book, wanting to prepare for the developer/2000 cert, because this is a good method for quick learning new stuff. I learned for the first exam PL/SQL with this book, and it was really interresting. Beginning with chapter 11 for Building Forms, I was very disappointed, since I had to waste my time learning, where or how to click or dbclick in the ObjectNavigator or LayoutEditor... (The 3 last exams could be summarized to only one !). I think, I will not continue my cert. But the book discusses really the needed stuff for someone, who want to be certified."
2,Preparing for OCP Developer Certification,"I purchased several recommended Oracle Press books in order to prepare for the OCP Application developer exam. I just finished taking the first exam 1Z0-001 and passed, but what a shocker! The preparation I received after a very thorough review from this book was no where near the preparation required, not even close.I just finished reading all chapters from this book for exam II - PL/SQL Program Units, and will hold off scheduling the exam itself until better sources can be identified.I would NOT recommend this book in preparation, at least not without considering other preparation resources/materials."
2,not that useful,"I have doubts about the usefulness of this book.There are topic outlines, but the CRAMSESSION OUTLINESavailable free on the Internet are just as good.As to practice tests, they are no match for those provided bySELF TEST software.Makes one wonder why anyone should purchase this book ?"
2,"Good Review, if a bit dated","This book will help you prepare for half of the OCP professional exams. Oracle has recently changed the format of the exams. Also, the book covers an earlier version of the Forms and Reports. This is not a major problem, but there are differences between Version 6.0 and 6i.I recommend this book for preaparing for the PL/SQL and package protions of the exams. The reader will have to supplement this book with additional preparation for the Forms part of the exam."
1,Poor study material for exams,"Being the only book available to study for the Oracle Developer Certification, you'd think this book would at the very least cover all of the information on the exam, right? WRONG! This book only covers a fraction of the material on the exam. It's much worse in the Forms sections than it is in the PL/SQL sections, though. Also, there are many typos and just plain wrong material in the book. But, this is the ONLY book available, so you really have to buy this and figure out some way of getting the rest of the material. This book is unacceptable. Even if you learn it cover to cover, you will not have all of the information you need to pass the exams."
3,"One of few books on the subject, but many mistakes...","Unfortunately, this is one of the few books available for Oracle developers. It's released by Oracle Press, so you'd thik it would be a comprehensive exam guide. But unfortunately, it isn't. It covers only about 75% of the exam material. On top of that, there's a good amount of wrong information, and missing files (that are supposed to be on the enclosed CD), with no web site for support. If you want to get certified, you really need this book. But, I'm unimpressed with it,overall."
2,Too basic,"Good book for a beginner (this is an excellent intro to SQL and PL/SQL), but not enough depth for the exams. It covers all the necessary areas, but barely skims the surface on numerous important topics. I recommend the Sybex book (even though it's a little dry). For each test, I'd start with this book and then move on to another text; that should be all you need to pass the exams. Be sure to PRACTICE; that's by far the most important element of success."
3,This book is loaded with information !!,"To clear the OCP papers you need two things - loads of information & hands on practice. This book is really a big help with the 'Information' part - it is loaded with information. However, it is not fully equipped to provide hands-on practice."
5,Sensual,"This music makes me say ""yes"" even if I don't think it. I have enjoyed the soothing, emotion evoking sound of his touch on the guitar. I have become a true ""fan"". I believe any woman who hears Malaguena played his way will feel the senousness of his music."
4,Two very good CD's.,"I saw Esteban play on HSN while I was channel-surfing and the music caught my attention. I've always liked Spanish guitar music, but only have one tape - Segovia. This collection of songs is mostly great, sometimes good and occasionally mediocre. I love the way that the trumpet and violin are introduced on only certain songs. They add nice accents. His guitar playing is probably great, but I'm not interested in listening to how skillful someone plays, I'm interested in enjoying the music. I continue to enjoy this music alot. It has been about 5 weeks that I've owed it. It makes great background music at parties or while working."
1,The guy dresses up like Zorro,I would have to agree with the other 1 star reviewer. Being a musician myself this Esteban really seems awful. I have seen the infomercial....i don't even think he is Spanish...........The guy is a halloween costume at best..Save the $ And buy a Segovia CD.
1,If there were fewer stars I would have chosen a negative,"This is a disgrace. I am an American and I have only heard Flamenco live once and the power and passion of ""true"" Flamenco is disgraced by this poor excuse for music. It is worse than ""smooth flamenco"" it is not good enough for an elevator. It is background music for a taco bell with the lead being played by a dog."
1,Select Phone 2000 - Very poor,"Select Phone 2000 was grossly misrepresented by InfoUSA. Using the internal ""Workbook"" to store data for the purpose of printing labels doesn't provide the ability to print more than 3000 records, contrary to what InfoUSA stated. Their surcharge for more records is outrageous."
3,Telephone catalogs,"I think the product is excellent for the price I originally paid. I found a couple of outdated numbers, normally that's not a bad average but I only look up a few numbers a month. You can't export enough numbers either but then of course I'm not using it for mailing lists. It outdates itself in a year, but at that price that's not so bad, you can afford to renew. But at the price they try to sell it for directly is not very reasonable, unless you are using it to extract high volume mailing lists. All in all it's a nice product."
1,Most disgusting thing ever!,"First of all, this product worked for my son. He is an overactive 7 year old doing poorly in school because he can't sit still and focus. He took this product for 3 days and by the third day, I noticed he came home very calm and got a good mark home that day. The problem is, the product is so disgusting that he won't take it. The first 3 days was a big fuss. I had to beg and bribe. The last dose he took, he actually gagged and threw up. After that he didn't care what I offered, he wasn't putting that nasty thing in his mouth! So, with that being said, the product is pretty worthless and definitely a waste of money since it is sitting in the medicine cabinet. My advice... try the liquid version, much easier and he doesn't complain about the taste. The only downside about the liquid is that it's only enough for about a week going off of the recommended dosage."
2,What a Pain in the A..,Wires come unassembled so be prepared to spend a lot of time putting these together and hope you have the proper crimping tools or you are simply up the creek!!!
4,Highly Recommended,"This group of Argentinian youth are great. All songs are in Castillian (Spanish) and have a wonderful array of songs and music. Songs are aimed at a younger audience around grade school. But the music is great and I often listen to it myself! Songs talk about 'puppy' love, about ""Mrs. Cow"" and all the great products that come from her. My kids love the music and dance to it. A very danceable beat with some latino rythms along with a couple of love songs. You will love the music and if you speak Spanish, you will love the simple, melodic lyrics."
5,Please Read It!,"This book was wonderful. From the very moment I picked it up, I was hooked. As soon as I finished, I flipped from the last page to the first page and started it again. I didn't want the story to end. I have never enjoyed reading a book more than I did this. Please read it. I recommend it to anyone that can read!"
1,Historically inaccurate & Demeaning,This book was an insult to Marie Laveau and all that she managed to achieve with her life. What we DO know historically about Marie was that she was an intelligent women who succeeded when literally everything was stacked against her. This author reduces her to a steotype of 'woman as inevitable victim of men in life' for some contemporary whim despite all historic evidence to the contrary. Any free New Orleans visitors guide has more accurate information about the Marie Laveau.
1,Voodoo Dreams: A novel of marie Laveau,"Could not get into the voo doo ""thing"" in New Orleans and only read half of the book. Author is coming to Phoenix in April. May change my mind, who knows?"
3,Don't Bother,"Boring and overly dramatic without purpose, also overly sexualized without purpose, hardly the historical fiction representation I was looking for."
1,garbage,what a pile of trash... so far from the truth of realism and the real Marie. I am so unhappy that I spent my time and money.
3,Grittty imagery in a hauntingly beautiful novel,"This is an amazing and superbly written book. I stayed up most of the night to finish reading it; I literally could not put it down. It's not often that I can describe a book at filled with gritty realism AND hauntingly beautiful writing, but that is my best summary of this fictionalized biography of Marie Laveau. However, while I appreciate what the author accomplished in explaining the troubling aspects of the Marie Laveau legends, this book was not a fun read for me. Then again, when I watch TV or go to the movies, I choose comedies, so I want to stress that this is purely a matter of taste. This book is a fabulous page-turner, and I am grateful for the deep historical research and insights this book provides. If you prefer realism to fantasy, or savor rich and vivid writing above all, you'll like this book. That said, while I rate the writing style high, I'd rather not think of Marie Laveau in this context."
5,marie is good book,My family originated from lousiana and we always heard about herand when I read the book it really opened my eyes to her.
1,Marie Laveux wasn't black,"First, Marie Laveaux wasnt black. She was very very light and mostly of Native American, French, Spanish and some black being that she was Creole. Creoles in her days weren't dark in complexion and didnt have the features that this author is showing. Creoles often come under attack from racist Southern whites in telling of New Orleans French Creoles but also of many African Americans who were very jealous and resentful towards Creoles in New Orleans. Marie LeVeaux still has relatives in New Orleans and California and they do not consider themselves African American or black."
1,Another hollow text,This text is a waste of time and dollars. I really could not even suggest who the target audience might be. The book is just a haphazard collection of ideas with no in-depth content all presented in the most confusing manner possible.For anyone looking for some solid advice on Data Warehousing look elsewhere. Even the Oracle side of this Oracle Press book is weak.
1,No Control,"This is a great product if the company using it wants limited control over, not just design, but also functionality. I bought this product with the assumption that it would help me to better design and control my ecommerce sight and as the book tells it, grow. The control is primarily a place called www.ecplace.com. This product should be advertised as an ecommerce interface to a third party vendor to market your ecommerce sight. When attempting to use the created product I found this ecplace site controls the transactions. Also, the enquiry form was actually at www.ecplace.com, even though while building the site or reading the book makes no mention that the product is sharing pages with a company on the net. I give this software a very low mark for the fact that it should be advertised as an interface and not a true ecommerce production tool. Smells of follow on expenses that small or new businesses doesn't need. I would stay clear of it."
5,Love it,"The visor fit perfect, I bought the ones that just 3M on the outside of the door of my wifes truck and those just come off after time. These go under the flap so it stays on for good."
1,Beware - sizing is anot accurate,Beware of these filters. They list as 16x16 but are only 15.5 x 15.5 but this company does not bother to tell you that on the item details page. I now have a crappy filter that falls out of the overhead vent EVERYTIME the furnace turns off. So much for trying to save money.
3,FLIMSY shell,"I was hoping to write a strong review for this. The PROS are lots of sizes to choose from and high MERV rating. The CONS are flimsy paper shell that gives the product the feel of the el cheapo filters. Very easy to bend when installing. And there was no mfr name or ID anywhere, so it looked like they are just plastic wrapped with their paper liner from the el cheapo suppliers. I don't have them in use 3 months yet, so I cannot comment on the filtration capability. I will not be purchasing them again, regardless."
2,On the Small Side,This filter is too small to fit in a standard carrier. An extra 1/4 inch on each side would fix it.
3,A Pretty Good Collection,"The songs here are pretty good:1. Octopussy2. I Spy3. Reilly: Ace of Spies4. Casino Royale5. The Ipcress File (A Man Alone6. Thunderball7. The Man from U.N.C.L.E.8. The Prisoner9. The James Bond theme10. Our Man Flint11. Moonraker12. The Spy Who Came in from the Cold13. Run Spy Run14. Get Smart15. You Only Live Twice16. 00717. Goldfinger18. The Rockford FilesThe addition of the Rockford Files theme is a little odd, but it IS a nice piece of music. If you like spy music, this is not a bad place to start.If you'd like to go deeper, check out Earle Hagen's ""I Spy"" soundtrack, or the fantastic ""Music from Peter Gunn"" by Henry Mancini."
4,Covered,"For the most part, the tunes are not sound tracks or original artists. I found the Man From U.N.C.L.E. cover limp compared to the original versions. Overall, however, a nice collection of this ilk."
3,The only Book on Pearse I could find,"I named my son after Padraic Pearse. He is a very inspirational figure to me. While I was pregnant with my son I read this book, and while it doesn't paint a ""horrible"" picture of him, it doesn't paint the ""best"" picture of him either. I knew this when I bought the book, so I took it all with a grain of salt. I feel like I do have a better understanding of his life and times, and who he was after reading the book, which is exactly what I wanted. I'm still looking to read more about this incredible man, so if anyone has suggestions let me know."
2,Difficult,Needed this book for a research paper and I was only able to use very little in the book for the class. Not what I thought what the book was about.
4,Very Good Personal Massager,"The Wahl 4120-200 is very good. It produces excellent vibrations at a very good price. Don't be fooled by the price, it is every be as strong as the much higher priced massagers. The only drawback is it's corded and not cordless, so for use with a partner it is not as flexible as a cordless might be. I have never found a cordless massager as strong as a corded one. If you want good vibration, you'll want the Wahl."
2,Very Disappointing,"I had one of these for many years until the cord frayed and I had to throw it away.I ordered a new one, but this is NOT the same as the old. For one thing, the speeds are not the same: the low setting is barely detectable, and the high setting is too much. I can tolerate it in the beginning of my ""massage"", but not at the end.Like Goldilocks, I am looking for my ""just right"" setting, and none of these are it. Why not have a slider, instead of only two preset speeds??The second problem is that this unit is very LOUD when pressed into a ""muscle"" on the high setting, as someone else has already pointed out. This was not a problem with my previous massager.Wahl must have done some sort of cost-cutting of this product, at the expense of quality."
2,Won't vibrate.,When you put a lot of pressure on this vibrator it stops vibrating. You can't get a good back masage with that.
5,Really great,I have used this thing countless times and it really works wonders. comes with a number of fitments and seems durable enough.very small and easy to use. has 2 settings: low/medium and high
4,"Great power massage tool, solid construction.","PROSLong power cordGreat point attachmentSolid motorCONSLack of other attachmentsPointsThis thing is built like it was made in the 70s, made it last! It is a very powerful motor that even when you dig it into your back does not stop! The provided attachments are nice, I wish they added some more with the box. Recommended for muscle pains!!!"
2,Sounds like a lawnmower!,"This devise feels great on the shoulders and all, but it is LOUD!!!! Sounds like a lawn mower in your ear!Wahl 4120-200 All-Body Massage Powerful Therapeutic Massager in Pharmacy Box"
1,terrible,It shakes a lot. --And that's all it dose. It only causes me dizziness when I applied it to my neck or back. Returned it after two days. Thanks Amazon though.
2,Its ok but nothing special for cellulite massage,"I only purchased this product for massage my legs and help circulation on my legs. I have to say all those review about ""personal"" use make me laugh. This machine is an heavy, cold and smelly plastic peace I cant immagine putting it ""there"" or even setting it on maximum speed there as some reviews stated.Cammon!! I rather get set off the old fashion way LOL. As massager I gave it 2 stars as its a cheap piece of heavy plastic and its non working at all good for massaging my legs or anything for that madder."
3,..Heavy to use .. ..,"I used this product more than 1 yrs... I found this is little heavy to use... While messaging MY face /neck..It is a Vibrator ,,,,,... it will vibrate constantly ... now you have to place this in a required area / gland to stimulate.. and roll it ....Its not like Sooo comfortable /relaxing SPA massage ... .. it will just fulfill your need ... I expected more from this machine ... but ... its ok .. i am managing .."
2,Massager,"This product would probably have been fine had it not been shipped from America and therefore had an american plug fitted. I purchased a plug to adapt from US to UK but this obviously did not work as after three minutes the product was so hot I thought it was going to catch light. Even after being unplugged for five minutes it still remained overheated. I thought it would have mentioned when purchasing it and submitting my address in England,that it was US voltage. I have to say that I had no problems returning it and was reimbursed within a couple of days. Really good service on that schore."
3,good,when am i ever going to receive what i orderd? what is the problem? It was suppose to be deliverd 2 days ago...i do not have it yet..........i will never use this web site again......very poor customr service. Very bad delivery............nothing has changed.....it is hours later and i still have not receieved my order...............they have hugh proplem with delivery............never had this problem with anyone else online....
2,NOT STRONG ENOUGH,"Other reviews praised the power of this little machine. While I agree it is small and light it didn't back the punch as described. Think carefully about your needs...if you are looking for a deep penetrating muscle massage, I'd recommend looking elsewhere....if however you want a gentle vibration this product will be stellar."
4,Wahl 4120-200 All-Body Massager,"I purchased the item to give myself facial massages and to help with migrane headaches, my favorite use is to give myself trigger point massages/drainage for swollen lymph nodes in my neck and it's does the job. So thanks!"
2,Too Loud,Not sure what's up with the quality control at Wahl. This is my third massager from them and they have gotten progressively louder to the point that this unit was unusable.
4,Not enough pressure,"I like this product, but I just wanted a stronger vibration. This is fixed by applying more pressure, but I think what I really needed was a stronger/more expensive massager. My husband, on the other hand, hates hard massagers and loves this one. Very good product and would've paid more for it than the $15."
3,a bit tame,"We replaced an older model of this same massager with this new one, and, although it is quieter, it is also less powerful, if that's the word. The old one would take a charley-horse and shake it to death. This one just doesn't have quite as much power."
4,Works miracles for tendinitis,After developing tendinitis I have used this gem to massage the knots of pain that occur when my tendons are inflamed. It has a cone shaped head that is perfect for the job. The only complaint I have is that it gets pretty warm after 20 minutes when running on high.
3,quiet but not effective for me,"After reading numerous reviews, I read that you should buy the one with the black electrical cord versus the white one due to some electrical problem. So I was pleased to see that this one arrived with a black cord.I bought the Acuvibe at the same time and have to compare: Acuvibe is a enffective cordless jackhammer....Wahl is with a cord, very quiet, and not effective for me....BUT if it does the job for someone and they don't mind the cord, what a GREAT price!"
4,Pretty Good Vibrations!,"I must say I was very skeptical when I received this massager as a gift. It looked a little clunky and is pretty heavy. However, once I turned it on and gave it a try I was pleasantly suprised.It has a really nice vibration speed and motion that is a little different compared to most massagers. Also, the rythm really is relaxing for the whole body, not just the area you have the massager directly on.I would recommend this product but wish they made it a little lighter. The wieght of it is a little cumbersome and could be a little too much for smaller individuals."
3,If it ain't broke - don't fix it ????,"I've had the OLD MODEL of this very Wahl massager for 25 years.The OLD model was GREAT!The NEW model is SO-SO.The body is heavier and bigger and so more difficult to manipulate. Also, the MOTOR IS NOT AS STRONG AS IT USED TO BE (in the old model). I was very disappointed.I put the new model back in the box and REPAIRED my OLD MODEL with wire nuts and electrical tape and am continuing to use that one.However, if you aren't comparing it to the old model and have no expectations - well then - it's a good, handy, compact massager with a decent motor and great multi-heads for getting in small spaces and especially joints (where those other big-headed ones just can't get to). Great for my neck and between shoulder blades."
5,Wahl All-Body Massager Review,Its very powerful and definitely serves its purpose regardless of what type or body part you want to massage. The cord is also very long compared to the normal length of cords so it is very convenient and reaches very easily.
3,They don't make them the way they used to,This product is okay. I rate it a 3 on a scale of 1-5. It is not a top quality instrument. You get what you pay for
3,Wahl 4120-200 Two Speed All-Body Massager,"This item has been on the market for a long time for obviouse reasons. It is simple, and affective. Outstanding for uses of muscle soreness or sexual intemacy."
2,EH....,"The knuckle attachment works,but even still, it only has two different speeds. The slower of the speeds is too weak, and the stronger is far to strong. If they had one that was in the middle it would be perfect. It definatley helps with the knots in my calfs though."
5,Vibrator for chest physio,"We are using this massager to do chest physio for our handicapped son. He has respiratory problems and require chest physio 3-4 times a day, while he is sitting in the wheelchair. I learned about this massager from the local home care people."
3,ok,This is ok for the money...has various attachments...seems like it's a sturdy product and will last for the money spent
2,"It's only O.K., and it's VERY LOUD!","I bought this to replace a Hitachi Magic Wand which broke within a year. This Wahl massager works O.K., and has a useful number of attachments, but it is VERY, VERY LOUD, especially when you're applying pressure (but even if you're not, it's still too loud). Also, there should be three settings, not two, based on the extreme differences between high and low. The low is very low, and the high is very high. There definitely needs to be a medium, which it doesn't have. All in all, I would not recommend it, nor would I buy it again. I may give the Hitachi another chance, since it seems most people do not have a problem with it breaking so quickly. Maybe I just got a lemon ..."
1,Good for NOTHING.,"This thing only has two settings, but they are both a simple 60hz vibration. In other words, the speed CANNOT be varied. The low setting is too weak to be useful.I'm not sure what this thing is supposed to help you with, but I didn't think it would be likely to provide a good massage, (or anything else for that matter) as it's action is from side to side, rather than up and down as with proper massagers.To top it all, the detachable plastic accessories are all made with poisonous PVC plastic.what utter junk this thing is!So, I recommend to save your money and look elsewhere, this thing is just a waste."
2,The handle is a bit heavy for women who have arthritis in the hands.,"As I stated, the handle is a bit heavy for someone who has arthritis in their hands but it does do the job."
3,Not thrilled.,All the vibration power is in the handheld part of the product. The attachments are oddly shaped and can pinch. Definitely wasn't thrilled with this at all.
2,not good for facial massage,"For the price, The product is ok for body massage but not too soothing for facial massage. The vibration is too high for facial massage and it doesnot relaxes the muscles but some how they get more tense"
2,Junk,Pros:Poweful massage while it lasts.Cons:Attachments are a joke.Overheats quickly and can burn skin.Guaranteed to break within a year.
2,Puny,"I had one of these, only single speed, back in the early sixties. It was noisy, got hot (metal housing), and vibrated the hand as much as the targeted muscle. But it seemed to massage pretty well. In comparison, while the new one is quiet--if not forced--and runs cool, I found it useless for deep muscle massage. The high setting is fine for facials, and possibly the back of the neck. The low setting is a joke.I thought I had a defective item, but when I plugged it into a watt meter, I saw it was delivering the correct ten watts. Maybe that's the problem. Ten watts isn't much.On the plus side, it's cheap."
3,SAD Wahl!!!,"Update: Kept it and it is OK, getting better or maybe I'm getting used to the lower speed.I have used the Wahl massagers for 30 years now. This is my third one. Each has lasted over 15 years and has been beyond wonderful...BUT this one is awful. Like many reviews have mentioned...the slow speed is really LOW and the fast is too intense. The size is too large and the color is an ugly gray. So overall, I'm very disappointed and may return it ="
5,Massager,Good sturdy product. Two speeds. Relaxes the deep muscles on the stronger setting. The lower speed does not work on tight muscles very well.
1,less than satisfactory,I was disappointed in this product. It's appearance was the first problem: It looks so austere. It's green metal and really big. Another problem: The low speed was too low and the high speed was waaay to high. How about a nice medium???Good price but not a good product.
2,Short life span.,"Loved it at first, then it got as noisy as a jackhammer after about 5 months. Now, 11 months later, it's broken. Don't buy this."
3,Best deal for the money,It would be nice to have an even a higher speed on it. The highest speed is still a little to slow for my tastes.
5,Does The Job,"I had a Wahl massager for over 30 years, and it is still working. It needed a new plug, so I replaced it, and figured I would price out a new one. I couldn't believe the price, unbelievably low, so I ordered it. All I can say is wow!!, this thing is on the money, multipurpose, works wonders on my shoulder, and my girl friend enjoys it also. It totally outshines the old one, the two speeds are great, built sturdy, really nice. I am going to order a spare, before they wise up and raise the price.............."
3,Not bad,"Nothing great. You get what you paid for. It helps me for a little home massage if I dont have the time to go get one. Great for upper back, shoulders and neck."
3,Lot of pulses but not enough pressure,"For its size it works pretty good, however, prolonged use makes the motor hot. The different attachments are fine but for what I needed it for its not quite powerful enough. In a pinch it works but you have to really push it into your muscles to feel it deeply, even with the deep muscle attachment."
4,Great value,"I got this for my tense shoulder and neck muscles. It really does the trick.It's fairly quiet, not too big or small, and comes with a lot of different attachments (though I've only used the deep muscle one so far).Like others have mentioned, I kind of wish it had a 'medium' speed - the low speed is too low to affect muscles (I suspect it's intended for more naughty purposes), and the high speed might be a bit too high for some people to get a relaxing massage, though it's perfect for pummeling wound up muscles.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the case does sometimes rattle a little depending on what position I hold it in."
5,Wahl Two Speed Massager,"This is a wonderfully effective massager that comes with seven different attachments to meet specific needs. I find myself utilizing the deep muscle and the spot application attachments for my chronic neck and shoulder tension. I don't find this model to be particularly heavy or noisy, as mentioned by another reviewer. It is designed well for hand-held, personal use and having the two speeds is ideal, as my neck and feet prefer the less intense speed. Another nice feature is the long cord. You can't beat the price and the company All About Massagers was very professional."
2,"Product was great, the people who sold it to me were not.","Great product but I was sent, apparently, a refirb. massager. The box came with only 4 attachments instead of the massager with the six in the description I paid for. When I contacted the sellers, they offered a refund or a replacement. I simply wanted the two attachments they owed me or the difference from the box with the 6 attachments in it. They gave me an excuse that it was the company's warehouse that was at fault, not them and I never got a response back from them when I asked what we can do about them over charging me for the product. It is a great massager, just be careful who you buy it from."
5,Great,"Very usefully.i keep close to my bed.Head massage,face massage.I can't say how much i like it....eventhough its small piece but very very helpfull.i would recomend it."
5,I love this!,This is a must have. I've had two of them. My dog chewed the cord on my first one and I immidiately bought a new one. I bought both of them through Amazon. They are wonderful!!!
4,value for money,"This little thing is value for money.I bought this purely for massage and no other purpose.Works well. The cable could have been a little longer, but nothing much to complain about."
5,LOOOOOOOOVVEEEEEEEEEEE IT,"My Husband and I work a lot, well that's an understatement lol, any-who, and coming home sore is no fun to anyone so this baby is nice to have handy, especially on thoughts really painful days. Deff 5 stars"
5,Multi-Purpose Use!!!!!!,"This is a multipurpose device - a good massager and a great vibrator!! Comes with two settings. In my opinion, the lower setting is not strong enough and so is hardly used. When pressed down hard on large muscle mass for a deeper massage, there is a horribly loud noise that can be heard, possibly due to rattling against the casing. However, this doesn't bother us too much as we don't mind anyone knowing that mommy is getting a massage for her aching back. It does provide a good massage. When used as a vibrator, it is reasonably quiet and works astonishingly well with the spot applicator. The bulky and awkward looking shape in NO way hinders this function. The ability to plug it in is so convenient (invest in a extension cord)- everybody thinks you use this for massaging muscles anyway!!. There is no need to fuss about with batteries or waning vibrations as batteries start to run out. Bought it about a year ago and still going strong. Double thumbs up for this product."
3,Handheld massager gets the basic job done.,"I purchased the Wahl 4120-200 Two Speed All-Body Massager in Pharmacy Box a few months back. I work in retail and having to stalk the soda can put a strain on the back, as can shoveling the driveway and weeding the garden. I used to have a massaging mat that would lay on a seat but it sadly died. I was looking for something simple to help ease the aches that come now and again. This massager does the trick, but it's hand held and therefore my arm gets tired while trying to reach my back after a while. The scalp and ripple attachments are really nice though. It's not bad for its price."
3,Powerful,"I replaced my old massager with the Wahl and am a little disappointed. A bit too strong, but sure some will still like it."
4,powerfull!!!,ITS A PRETTY STRONG MASSAGER! ALMOST TO MUCH TO HANDLE. I DONT RECOMEND THE SCALP ATTATCHMENT IT HURTS! I THINK MY FAVORITE ATTATCHMENT IS THE ONE WITH THE NUB. IT GETS DEEP INTO THE MUSCLES AND HELPS. I ALSO DO NOT RECOMEND USING IT ON YOUR ANKLE. I HAD GOTTEN IT FOR MY ANKLE BECAUSE I HURT IT BACK IN JULY LAST YEAR AND IT HURTS ALL THE TIME BUT THAT MADE ME HAVE HORRIBLE PAIN! BUT IF USED ON YOUR BACK OR LEGS IT IS WONDERFULL AND GOOD PRICE TO :)
5,NICE!,"just got this today! i tried the ""facial""attachment, i must say it felt good... have not used the other attachments yet...but i like it the handle is very light and it doesnt make loud noise...oh thanks for shipping it fast!.."
5,Classic,"This is classic Ramsey Lewis, at his best blending his love for jazz and popular music. The selection of tunes illustrates Ramsey's grasp of music of all genres. In addition to already-known hits, check out ""Serene Funk"" and ""Dreams."""
5,Great Review,"I bought this as a review for my 6th grader. It has helped him review material he already knows. We have not gotten further along in book where he is not as confident with the material. However, after completing this book I feel he will be more confident. A great book for independent learning."
2,It's Aight,"I heard it and at first I really didn't like it, but after a couple of times after it turned to be aight."
2,disappointing,"I loved Caribe Atomico. So I bought this one. Disappointing. I don't have the patience to dig up the comparisons, but I've heard nearly all of this before."
5,A needed update,"For a ""dead"" language you may ask why an update on such a book is needed? The second edition had a promised section in the answer key for chapter one, which was missing. Such an omission can be a discouragement to a beginner in just about anything, particularly languages. I remember a guidebook to the Delphi programming language, from Sams Publishing, which had a mistake in the very first coding exercise.Well done Ms Harwood. It's a great book, well set out and with plenty of humour in the ""Complete Idiot's"" tradition, whilst still not being over the top. The paradigms at the back of the book are useful and digestible.Supplementary to any Latin course, including this book, I'd purchase vis-ed (see vis-eddotcom) flashcards. Their Latin flashcards are great. I don't work for the company, honestly, I live on the other side of the planet."
2,Poor,"The title says it all. I found the arrangement and logic - or rather lack of it - frustrating. Old-fashioned rote learning and lists of words put together merely because they belong to the same conjugation make for an unpleasant learning experience.By far the best language course isLingua Latina per se Illustrata, Pars I: Familia Romanawhich allows you to learn the natural way. A good addition for further practice isLingva Latina - Via Latina: Easy Latin Reader (Latin Edition)."
5,Challenging yet fun.,"I enjoy learning from this book. Especially the chart that the book offers.It becomes a great source of offering to me.If you think Latin is challenging to learn, this is the right book for you to explore."
5,This is the CD!,"This is a wonderful Eartha Kitt CD with some of her best songs. If there is one CD of Ms. Kitts that you should get, this would be the one."
4,Even my unfocused eyes can take clear pictures,"I received this camera as a gift for my birthday 2 years ago and I've taken so many pictures since. Mostly of our 2 year old (what else would you expect of a first-time Mom?). The color and crispness of the pictures is excellent; better than I expected for a camera at this price. Loading and unloading the film is a breeze, and it's so lightweight it's not a bother to hang around your neck (like some others are). I would recommend it for the amateur or pro photographer."
2,Worked well for 1 year.,"My wife and I bought this camera because it was simple to use and picture quality was good. That was until it stopped working properly. Now the zoom sticks, sometimes the lense will not close at all and the object in the viewfinder will not zoom as the lense does. It was purchaes in January 2001 and the warranty is now up. Not Happy!"
4,Great background about animal shelter workers,"I was doing a research paper on animal shelters and while trying to understand the euthanasia debate, Arluke gave great unbaised research especially about the choices animal shelter workers must make when working at an open admissions shelter.Although extremely informative, it should be updated (i.e., Utah is not an entire state of 'no kill' policies, although it is striving to do so)."
3,Not as great as I anticipated.,"First of all I ordered this, and only received one item, but the seller immediately took care of it. Now the overall product is okay. But, it's not anywhere near the coverage that I had assumed it would be with the other persons review. It dries fast, so you'll need to figure out how to get it on and smooth it out before that happens. I found that using a foundation pad worked the best with this one, but as I said it dries so fast you will probably notice streaks with it, especially on your neck or under chin. I have fair skin with freckles and I wanted something that would help cover the freckles up without looking caked on and figured this would be it. But, overall the coverage isn't great and it feels heavy on your face, so I'm on to find something better."
2,Maybe for the winter or fall,"I bought this product a couple of months ago and I'm still not too sure if I like it or not. Its medium coverage, if you have a pimple or red on your skin this will make it lighter, but not completely disappear. This is definitely not a foundation for hot weather. It looks like you have make up on. I wouldn't purchase this again because it didn't deliver anything close to what I wanted."
3,not too bad,"I like this product, but there a few things that I don't like about it.. For one, it is extremely matte.. to the point that it seems kind of unnatural on me. Also, the SPF on this isn't really high enough to really help you and it causes you to look ghost white in pictures. I don't really understand the point of SPF in this foundation. Last thing I don't like about it is that you have to pour it out because there's no pump and that's super super annoying. However, I heard that they will be coming out with a pump again!!!! Other than those things, this provides medium to full coverage and it looks pretty good on your skin. It's also not too heavy so it doesn't feel that bad. I think it is very close to MAC's liquid foundation. I would give this product a 3/5. It's not all that bad, but I think I prefer maybelline's superstay foundation if you were looking for another long lasting drugstore brand!!! :)"
5,Beautiful and Powerful,"When someone introduced me to ""Sweet Honey,"" they stuttered over a description - ""well, they are 5 African American women plus a woman who signs . . . and they sing gospel, traditonal African and original compositions. They use a few percussion instruments. They sing of love and justice and freedom and life and Jesus."" I could not imagine such a mix! But I went to their concert and was mesmerized. If you are looking for a category or a short description, I am not able to offer one. This particular CD of Sweet Honey contains quite a few classic black gospels presented a cappella with the potential to take your breath away. These are powerful women with powerful voices to fill your soul. Sing along and let this music lift your spirit."
2,Creative and modern interpretation,"Karcher's interpretation is an interesting modern alternative to Wilhelm/Baynes neo-confused and Christian version. Unfortunately, Karcher adds more refuse and he has failed to access some contemporary translations. Compared to Lynn or Shaughnessy, Karcher rarely bothers to explain when he is using an unknown Chinese source and when he is making things up as he goes along. This slippery and highly creative way of translating gets even worse in his personal interpretation of Te Chuan. He is very good-willed, yet Karcher still has not learned the difference between the yin and yang-sides of his cash (Chinese coins)..."
5,book in excellent conditions,"I was surprised that the book came much earlier than it was expected.Although it is a used book, it is really very good."
1,A waste of paper,"This contains 88 panels of '50s Pogo strips at one panel per page. The quality of illustration definitely does not merit the scale. The book appears to be intended for young children(?) but I cannot picture it being a hit with young ones. I'd sell my copy, but I feel like I'd be swindling anyone who bought it. Pogo is marvelous, but this isn't the book to experience that."
1,buyer beware,"This is a very cheap light. It actually broke the very first time I screwed the bulb in. It really isn't worth my time to send it back or deal with the return, I just wanted to post a review for future buyers. The socket itself twisted off its base rendering it useless.I am a mechanical engineer and would fix it if I could but it is unrepairable so its in my junk pile for future projects/parts. fyi homedepo has a better unit for $5, I just couldn't find it in my store the first time I looked and jumped on amazon to get one quick."
5,Awesome!!!!,"I am an avid Dendrobium orchid grower.Absolutely love this book, there are few orchids books around that go this indepth into any genera of orchid keeping. It's good to see a detailed book which give plenty of cultural information on each species. I particularly liked the descriptions of the natural growing environments, it helps me with their cultural requirements so I can grow them in my glass house.This one is a most own book for any Dendrobium grower or any orchid show judge."
5,Dendrobium and It's Relatives,"This is definitely one of the best books I have read on Dendrobiums (I've been growing orchids for 20 years). It is written in a clear, easy to understand manner in an ""easy to read"" style. Part 1 covers classification, distribution and origins, traditional uses, ecology, cultivation and artificial hybrids. Part 2 describes over 400 species each of which is shown in full colour and includes information on where the orchid is found in its natural environment and how to cultivate it out of that environment.I believe this book will appeal to everyone who grows these fabulous plants whether they are new to the hobby or experienced growers."
5,Even if you do not read DAWN read DARKEST Hour!!,"Darkest Hour was one of the best books that I have ever read! The Cutler family series was wonderful! It was the best series that I have yet read by Mrs. Andrews', although Flowers In the Attic and Petals on the Wind are the best books. While reading Dawn, Secrets of the Morning and Tarnished Gold or even Midnight Whispers I never thought that I would feel sorry for Grandmother Cutler (Lillian) until I read this book! Even if you don't read Dawn read this book it was great!"
3,Mixed emotions.,"I had mixed emotions about this book. I'll start with the bad. It held no surprises like past VC Andrews books had which was disappointing. This whole Cutler series kept repeating itself over and over again. One character always seemed too much like past charcters. I kind of figured this book would explain why Lillian hated Dawn so much. But it didn't. In fact I would've thought Lillian would pity her. If this book would have kept going on and wrote about how Lillian changed after first arriving at Cutler's Cove I might have rated this book different. I also had to wonder why Dawn's orginal name was Eugenia. Why would Lillian have a say in naming her grandchild after her beloved sister, Eugenia? Considering she knew it was her husbands child. She had to have known that Randolph was not the father before Dawn was born. Other than that the book was too bad. It was one of the sadder one's I've read. But you can get through this series without having to read it."
4,V.C. Andrews Seems to Repeat...,"Even though I'm a big V.C. Andrews fan, I still feel that these books repeat themselves. For example, we have women who are so GORGEOUS that men have to rape them to ""teach them what they should know"". Then they marry, and usually their husbands stray away... but the women always forgive them, or don't confront them at all. Have you read the Dollanganer series by V.C. Andrews? All of these books have a ring to it! The gets raped, has an evil sibling... hello? Do you sense a trend here? Still, I enjoyed this very predictable book."
5,Highly Recommended,"Not much to say other than it works perfectly and couldn't of found it cheaper anywhere else. The stores are selling these cables for $40-$80. I just got it here for $6 after shipping. If you need an HDMI cable, just get it here.Pro: cheap. works perfectly.Con: None."
5,IT WORKS!! No to the monster!!,What can you say it cost me only a BUCK!!! and it works. Thanks Amazon Tried out my monster hdmi and this i don't see a difference in 1080p quality or audio quality. Save your self some money and buy this.P.S. My Monster HDMI cost me 50.00 on sale wow i was duped.
5,HDMI cables on the cheap,This is a great product! How many times have you gone to the big box retailers or to specialty stores and found 6' HDMI cables for $50-$100?? The least expensive HDMI cable I could find in my area was $30. I checked Amazon and found this cable and decided to give it a try. It works just like the expensive cables at a fraction of the price. Do yourself a favor and save a TON of money and buy a few of these cables. Shipping and the cable cost added all together was still about 1/5 of what a cable like this cost at a local discount retailer. Buy 2 or 3 at a time and keep some around as spares. At this price and quality you can't go wrong.
2,Check the Shipping Cost,"The cables are fine cables. I rated this particular offer as an ""I don't like"" because the shipping nearly doubles the price of the cables (shipping for me was per cable, not a flat fee for the order). So the great deal then becomes something you can find elsewhere if you are resourceful. Buyer beware."
3,These cables are ok.,"I bought this HDMI cable for my Blu-Ray player and was a little disappointed in the picture quality. I think this line of cables will be just fine for digital cable/sat or an upconvert DVD player. If you're wanting to use it for a 1080p Blu-Ray or (now obsolete) HD DVD Player, go with a better cable."
1,worthless,"I bought this a a really low price- under $5 so it seemed like a really good deal and I was so excited. I had been planning to use this so I could link my laptop to the TV. However, the stupid thing doesn't fit in my laptop. All the specs match and this cord came up specifically for my laptop model. It's completely worthless. The only plus side is that shipping was free and the cord was super cheap- didn't bother returning it. It sitting on some shelf somewhere."
1,Bad experience,"I can't complain about the shipping service but the cables were plain defective... sound was great but there was no video, bought some $15 dlls cable and works awesome..."
5,The best HDMI cable deal.,"Mine works great. Although I saw some bad reviews about not working or cheap quality of it, I said to myself it's only a couple of bucks that I'm risking for something that cost ten times or more in some places.Chances are the most of them will work just fine like mine. Otherwise it would not have received 4+ star rating."
1,NOTE: shipping is more than the cables,"Maybe it's me, but I have trouble when it costs me more to ship something than it does to buy it. I canceld my order for these cables when I saw the outrageous shipping (I know, handling) costs. Note also this item does not qualify for free super-saver shipping.These are inexpensive enough - they should have made the item a buck more and the shipping a dollar less - that would have seemed less sneaky."
5,hdmi,Works perfectly. I got it for 3 bucks Vs. my little brother who went to the store and bought the same cable for $30.00 (estimate but close) so need I say more???
2,Missing items have yet to be shipped,"I ordered 1 connector and 2 HDMI cables. The connector arrived, but 2 cables are no where to be found. Emailed customer service a few times, got back canned response which looked like the writer did not know the situation but simply say they will be shipped now, and 'now' means any time in the future with no ending. calling the toll number is simply a waste of time, all you hear is the machine telling you pressing this or that button. stay away from this reseller. price is right, but what is good if you could not get what you ordered?"
5,BUY 3 or more!,"I save buckets of money and bought 3 at once! Great connectors, tight fitting, superb quality! Worked great with my Samsung TV, JVC dvd player and dish network receiver! I should have bought 5!"
5,Great Deal!,"This product of course is neede to any high def. hook up.. I now buy all my stuff from monoprice,com great site with great prices."
1,HDMI handshake issue,"I think I'm the unlucky one.When I connect this cable between DMA2100 and 1080p LCDTV, I get, what I believe, the HDMI handshake issue. The screen flashes several times.After replacing it with a $40 one, this issue went away. If I reconnect the problematic cable, the same problem is reproduced."
5,Simply Amazing,"This has been a joy to use. A couple months before I bought a monster cable for over $100!!!! But when I saw this cable here for under a dollar and $3 for shipping, I was a little uncertain if it would be good, but I ordered it and I realized from the second I used it that its quality is just as good as the Monster cable.Amazing product I will buy from Efrocity again."
3,"Yep is ""cheap"", some problems","I went for the cheap cable, and it is. For the price it gets the job done but for a few dollars more, get a slightly better cable. Make sure you're getting 1.3b type cables.I am using this with my PS3 connected to a Samsung 52"" 650 model TV. I notice little white specks randomly bouncing around the screen ALL THE TIME. The pixels are small so its not super obvious unless you look. Basically this is an artifact from random digital bits being corrupted/dropped.So, while it works. I wish I would have spent a few more bucks and got a better cable."
1,You get what you pay for,This cable worked fine....for one week. After that I couldn't get HD at all. Replaced this HDMI cable with the original audio/video cables that came with the cable box. OK now.
5,no complaints,What do I say? I plugged it in and it worked. I don't see why you would want to spend more. They shipped the product really fast.
5,Works Great for me,"I was looking for some HDMI cables to connect my Tivo to my TV. I saw a wide range of prices for these cables ($5 - $100).I'm not sure what the differences are between the cheap one and the expensive one. I decided to go with these cable b/c the price was cheap and according to the reviews, works just as well as the expensive one.I rec'd them with no problem and the hook up was simple. The quality to me seems good but I don't have anything to really compare it too. Since I have never used the more expensive HDMI cable.For me, these cables work fine and have no complaint."
5,Not much to say really,"Umm, It's a cable, at the time they practically were giving it away. Amazon seems insistent a year later they still want a review, well it still works."
1,"In this case, I didn't get what I paid for.","Sure, they were only a penny a piece when I bought them but still, I should have gotten what was advertised- HDMI cables that worked.Only one out of 4 cables worked on any of my equipment. The fourth cable works only on my satellite tv box, but nothing else.I continue to believe that no @!%*$ cable is worth anywhere near $60 and up. Wire is wire; I'm sure there are reasonably priced HDMI cables (like for under $10) that work and meet HDMI 1.3 high speed specs just as well as the $100+ Monsters. This ain't one of them."
1,You get what you pay for,Didn't work right out of the packaging. My computer recognized that I had plugged something in but the monitor received no image. I used a different cable and I immediately had an image.
1,"Displays Green, white and pink lines","The picture quality is great most of the times when I use this cable. But after playing for some time (20 mins to 2hrs) there are green, pink and white lines that appear on the TV and the picture is not visible at all. I had to restart my TV and the picture comes up good again. My old HDMI cable never did this. At first I thought it is an issue with my TV (new Sony Bravia z series 46""). But after talking to the Sony personnal and the DISH network they said it could be the issue with the HDMI cable. hmn..I am not happy with the cable."
5,Kerr does it again!,"What a great novel about the lives of shelter animals! Kerr writes vivid characters that evoke sympathy for the plight of all the unwanted animals out there. They each have a story to tell--just like Placido the one-eyed Siamese, Marshall the king snake, and Irving the older pointer. A quick read!"
4,Not a Terrible book...,"This story involves Boris and Annabelle. Two kids who upon a major discovery, become involved in somthing that they don't know how to get out of. Mary Rogers is a fantast writer, placing words that create suspense on every page. What if you had a TV station that aired shows one day early? You would become Rich, but...who created it...and how does it work? Join three kids as the struggle to learn the secrets as their lives are put in danger in an okay book."
3,Great Book!,"Hi, I am working at ILISA Language Institute in Costa Rica, San Jose and I just want to say that this book helps our student a lot by giving them helpful tips or by arrange their own travel in Costa Rica. Thanks!"
5,Good addition to my IT library,"I think that this book is a great addition to my IT library. Although it lacks in-depth explanations,it explains enough to get a basic understanding of what you are doing. I think this book is great for anyone thatis already a pro and just needs a reminder once in a while, or someone who really has no idea what is going on,but still needs to perform the tasks.. It's easy to findwhat you need, when you need it, and the step by step instructions with pictures are clear and concise,so easy in fact that my girlfriend can perform the task's in the book.Basically, a great reference book for those that already know what they are doing and just need a refresheronce in a while. It would also help anyone that takes care of a server locally, but doesn't really have or needa deep understanding of what is going on. I feel that this would also be usefulfor anyone that is currently studying the 2003 MCSE track, and is just looking for something to supplement theirtraining kit."
1,Dummies Book Better,"Both this book and the Server 2003 for Dummies deal with the same topics, server administration for people that don't know anything about servers. The dummies book is 100 times more useful than this one. Although both are aimed at the same market, this book is far more superficial and I'm left to wonder what I can get out of it that I couldn't get out of the most basic help file."
5,Great separator,"I was looking for something with the clear bowl and drainout so I could see what was going on, and this fit my need perfectly. It was a good value too compared to similar models."
2,Consider Researching Elsewhere,"I purchased this study guide a few months ago to use as a source in my book report for a science class. I found much of the information in the guide was available on other websites for free. The book provides background information for the author, provides a brief context as to when the story was published, and in very short paragraphs does a chapter by chapter summary. The chapter by chapter summary was very unsatisfying, considering that I had read the book months before and needed it for a test as well as the book report at the time.In conclusion, I would recommend purchasing this product as a last resort. On a positive note, the download from Amazon following the purchase was instantly added to my account and my computer. If you are interested in finding out information about Silent Spring or Rachel Carson, consider researching elsewhere on more helpful online resources, for free."
3,Not for the Beginner,"Crowley's classic work, the Book of Lies, is an obscure book of mystical poetry that HINTS at many secrets of occultism. Not for the unintiated, this book requires a comprehensive knowledge of Qaballah, Thelema, Magick and of the works of Crowley himself before any of its hidden wisdom will reveal itself to the reader.Otherwise it remains a cornerstone of modern occultism- a must for the library of every serious student of High Magick and of Thelema."
4,The Poetry of Aleister Crowley,"In this volume is collected most of Aleister Crowley's poetry. It's a real like it or hate it affair, even for occultists. I enjoyed the poems on magick rituals and also his lover Laylah. I read this in a few days because each poem is a chapter and they're only a half of a page or a few pages in length each. Not your typical poetry, but highly original and enticing for the Thelemite."
3,a genius???,Enjoyable but hard going in places however i am new to his work so I may just not understand it.
4,Idiotic,"I'm a supporter of Crowley and I think this book is idiotic. It's so stupid you can't help but love it. This book strikes me as one big joke to test the occultist's sense of humor, much like the hilarious occultic nursery ryhme analysis in Book 4. You can't waste your life any better than reading Book of Lies. It is sheer nonsense. It would take a genius IQ to grasp this utter idiocy. This is black humor at its finest. I'm not a fan of poetry. Compared to Crowley's other books I say this is his worst. It lacks the entertainment value of his novels Moonchild and Diary of a Drug Fiend, it lacks the conciseness of Confessions and it lacks the true occultic aspect of Illustrated Goetia. Book of Lies is dumb is what I'm trying to say."
3,"Excellent Service, strange man","Though, the service from this particular seller was excellent and I only ordered the book because I was curious about Aleister Crowley I actually haven't read this book. I read the ""Book of Law"" and that was enough for me to get an idea of what Aleister Crowley was about. He was a chess master, mountain climber, poet, painter, astrologer, drug experimenter, and social critic, but something must have went wrong early in his life for him to follow the path he did. Maybe it was being raised as a Darbyite which are members of the most extreme wing of the Protestant sect known as the Exclusive Brethren. John George Haigh who is known as the acid bath killer was also a Darbyite. I appologize if there are any Darbyites out there, but most likely being a Darbyite prevents you from reading this."
1,jibberish,Have you heard the saying that if a room full of monkeys typed randomly for an infinity they would eventually write the complete works of shakespeare?well I reckon it would take 2 monkeys about a week to complete this book. . .no revelation. no secret meaning. no truth. no lies. just jibberish.
1,Filled with fallacy,There is not much to say about this text. The man has obviously desired attention all of his life and so goes to make up some wild explanations. Not to be read by the serious intellectual.*
2,Kindle edition is a mess.,"I'm profoundly disappointed. This Kindle edition is just a ""converted to eBook"" version of the text transcriptions which have been on the internet since the '90s. Who authorized this? The current version at hermetic.com has been improved over the years to the point where this Kindle version is just a sad relic. The Book of Lies deserves a high quality Kindle version. Avoid this one."
2,Very poorly formatted for Kindle.,"It's UGLY. I was very excited to see this available for the Kindle. Very glad I downloaded the sample before buying it. It's a mess. In this book, more than any other, Crowley took care as to how it looked on the printed page. This Kindle version murders the appearance of the material."
3,Biography,"Most of the time I don't like reading biographical books, but Martin's Big Words definitely caught my interest. I mainly enjoyed the illustrations. There is just something about each new page that brought emotion and truth into the words that I read. I liked how the author used a bigger font for quotes that Martin Luther King Jr. said. Those enhance the story and make his words seem very powerful. I think this book would be great to incorporate in a history lesson in a classroom. It gives an overview of Martin's life, which would make the students more interested to know more about what he did and how he helped changed America. This book is a great read. I definitely suggest it to anyone who is interested in biographies."
5,martins big words,"Martin's big words ,teaches children how Martin grew up and some of the problems he faced for being african american.Even though I did not learn anything new from this book. I liked it because it has a lot of information that would seem to simplify Martin Luther Kings part in history.Also this book has a lot of artistic illustrations.There seems to be little details that reveals a hidden meaning to the illustrations.For instance I thought it was interesting that the stained glass is different shades of skin tone.When I start to teach this would be a book I would want in my classroom to read to my students after giving a lesson on Martin Luther King."
4,Martin's Big Words,I read this book in Grad School and wanted to share to share it with my students. The illustrations are beautiful.
5,LOVED THIS BOOK,We bought this book along with another for my 1st grader's book report. This is a great book with just enough detail for a kid. He was able to read most of the book himself and did a great job on his book report. I highly recommend this book.
4,Martin's big words the life of Dr. Martin Luther King JR. By Doreen Rapport,"The book that I read was Martin Luther King Jr the book is good . On, 1/15/29 martin Luther king jr was born in Atlanta Georgia. On, June/18/1953 got married. In, 1968 he was shot and died. Martin Lther king jr, was a Chrishian. He is black. In church martin sang hymns. He read from the bible."
3,Martin's Big Words,"Loved this book on the life of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. It gave me a little more insight into some things that i never about Dr. King, Jr. and also gives the history of struggles for civil rights which he fought for, not just for himself but for every African American. I really enjoyed how the author bolded the words or statements by Dr. King, Jr. to show more meaning and depth. Bryan Collier did an outstanding job with illustrating all the vibrant and colorful pictures throughout the book as well. As a teacher, I would definitely incorporate this book into the classroom."
5,Great product - no complaints,"Really - no complaints. Holds and protects my Treo very well, no falls and no incidents. The only ""drawback"" is that the belt clip is VERY tight. It's a little hard to put on, but the result is that you can be sure it won't fall without notice."
3,"Nice finish/quality, but phone answers","I had a clip-on holster that was vulnerable to dropping my Treo, and it rubbed the finish off where it squeezed the phone. I bought this because it is much more protecting. It does have a nice fit and finish, and nice magnetic clasp, BUT, and it's a BIG BUT, I cannot reliably pull the phone out without it answering...and I want to be able to check the caller I.D. BEFORE I answer. I have the screen deactivated on in-coming calls, and while on calls, but it still answers when I remove it from the case (unless I'm REALLY careful, which is awkward 99% of the time).If you don't care about that feature, this is a nice case. If you do, consider other options."
2,Too Bulky!,"The leather and the magnetic closure are nice. However, I had to use pliers to loosen up the belt clip and after carrying it on my belt for a few days I found it bulky and uncomfortable, especially when sitting."
4,Palm TREO carry case,"I use this case with my TREO650. It is a great improvement over the old flip style case. The magnetic close works well. The phone seems so much smaller now that the vinyl case is gone. One small problem, the stylus CAN fall out. Be sure yours is a snug fit."
2,Ok!?,"I thought the shark MX was ok. Its keyboard is really small, and hard to use, and my 30 free minutes ran out in like 10! The extra features are cool, like a hard to use PDA"
4,"Auteur, compositeur, interprète francophone",Michel Rivard est un auteur exceptionnel. Il écrit des textes sublimes et compose des chansons de toute beauté. Ce disque est une compilation de ses succés; il manque malheureusement des extraits de ses 2 derniers albums pour que le portrait soit complet.
5,Excellent hikes for Sedona,"The hikes are presented with all the information needed - distance, skill level, estimated time, and how to get to the start of the hike. For less than a week in Sedona, ten select hikes makes more sense than having to choose among 50 or 100. There are good color pictures and the guide is small enough to pack easily."
4,The skinny.,"It's my first time buying a pair of these Family Radios, and I'm very happy with the Uniden FRS420. With 14 channels, 38 subcodes, 5 different call rings, and a vibrating alert. It can't be beat for the price."
3,"good reception, but call button gives false alarms",I liked the sleek design and the clip. The reception was good and it's easy to use right out of the box. My only complaint is that the call button is not very recessed and gets pushed by accident many times both on my unit and on my kid's. Maybe if you don't bump into anything or try to put it in a pocket or backpack it will be ok. Great reception and features for the price.
4,A nice pair of radios (I bought 2),"I mainly use FRS radios with a Law Enfocement Group in Hawaii, and it works great! I have been using these radios for about 3 months now, and they work perfectly with other brands of radios (a Motorola Talkabout w/ headset, and a pair of Audiovox with only 14 channels). The only complaint I have with this radios is that the call and menu button are using the same button. If I want to change channels, I have to press the menu button down for a long time, and if I forgot about that, then I send out a call message. Also, the vibrating feature isn't great, even with strong batteries."
3,Uniden FRS420 Eco Trek2 Radio,"I bought this radio to keep in touch with my buddies while hunting. It's about what I expected, limited by the terrain (oak, mesquite and scrub). It does fit my needs. My only complaints are that the battery cover is a real bear to remove!, and it too easy to hit the talk button."
3,It clips onto your belt,"Great design concept, however since the clip is made out of plastic, durability may come into question. I also think that having the antenna clip combination may effect the range. The radio fits well into the palm of your hand and the sound quality is ok."
4,Great book.Very insightful,Agatha is a very emoionally demanding and strong willed woman who frightens her husband Archie. He probably grew up with a emotionally domineering mother who made him feel inadequeate. he doesn't like Agatha because she makes he feel bad.He would much rather marry Nancy because she is plain and bland and doesn't threaten him. he likes obedience.
4,Cords,We like this cord easy to use works well that's it .I'm a contractor that keeps equipment for years
4,"Angels and Demons, by Dan Brown",Excellent piece of work! You do get attached to it until you finish reading it! Great gift for any smart person!
2,angeles y demonios,si te gusta la ciencia ficcion y eres un fan the dan brown entonces este libro es para ti
5,"Increible, convincente y narrado con excelencia.","La novela es muy buena; una historia que bien podría decirse es paisajista, estremecedora, trepidante, dinámica y humana. La narración la enriquece, la hace grande; es tan buena que cada voz pinta inequívocamente a los personajes, cada silencio y cada palabra pronunciada matizan artísticamente las escenas que se van pintando en la mente. Una narración memorable e ingeniosa.Me encanto, fue una sublime delicia que se gano mis oídos y lleno de colores, formas, paisajes y lugares mi imaginación."
1,Angels & Demonicos,"Although I should have recognized it was in Spanish, I did not. It should not have come up with the search for Angels & Demons, or, if it did, it should have clearly identified it a such. It was in line with others responding to my search, and from that point all I looked at was price, etc. assuming all were the same. Secondly, there were no options for casettes. Everyone is not totally current with technology."
3,REALITY IS SCORNED,"PEOPLE REALLY DON'T WANT TO READ ABOUT REALITY. IT UPSETS THEM. OVERALL, THEY DON'T LIKE TO SEE IT IN THE MOVIES OR LISTEN TO IT IN DISCUSSIONS. BUT IT'S OUT THERE WITH ITS SLIMEY HEAD. YOU CAN FIND ALL ABOUT REALITY, ALL ONE NEEDS IS A LIBRARY CARD. BROWNMILLER'S EFFORT DOESN'T EVEN SCRATCH THE SURFACE, BUT IT'S BLUNT AND GRAPHIC AND THAT WILL TURN OFF EVERYBODY WHO EQUATES SUCH INFORMATION AS PORNOGRAPHC. IF YOU THINK SHE WAS INCORRECT IN THE VIETNAM SECTION READ: NAM, BY MARK BAKER AND FOR A MORE YEAR BY YEAR WORLDLY DISSERTATION READ ""OUR ORIENTAL HERITAGE BY WILL DURANTE."" THEY WILL CURL YOUR WHISKERS."
1,Regarding Susan Brownmiller's characterization of Juanita,"A previous comment stated that Susan Brownmiller, while finding Juanita credible, nonetheless feels that President Clinton should get a pass because of his ""virility"".Given the subject matter of this book, I assumed the reader's comments were just fictitious ravings of a Clinton-hater, so I checked it out.Alas, the reader is correct. Salon magazine quotes Brownmiller and other feminists who, unbelievable, condone rape when perpetrated by a leading Democrat with the attitude ""Let's move on"".Anyway, you can form your own opinion (as politically incorrect it is to think for yourself) as to how Brownmiller's viewpoint on this issue impacts the credibility of her book."
1,Dangerous Distortion,"It isn't as if rape awareness is such a weak cause that it needs the inflammatory and misleading statements made by Ms. Brownmiller. This book, like those written by Rush Limbaugh,will find a very willing audience. But, like Limbaugh's, it is utterly worthless at raising the level of dialogue. It lowers it."
1,Brownmiller reflects the Sickness of the Feminists,"Comparing Against Our Will to Ms. Brownmiller's tortured attempts to defend Clinton demonstrates how the politicization of feminism has moved us a great step backwards. The last reviewer's somewhat bowdlerized version of Ms. Brownmiller's defense shows how we are willing to adopt the boys will be boys attitude of sexist Southern judges in exchange for window dressing. What has Clinton done for women? He's given us an Attorney General whose chief function is to cover up the President's crimes and he has appointed a Georgetown hostess to sit in the big office at the State Department and take orders from Strobe Talbott. It's not as if he has appointed dynamic women to any posts. There is no Jeanne Kirkpatrick in his administration, just some puppets who say what rich white men tell them to say. For this, Ms. Brownmiller is willing to overturn a lifetime of work raising the world's consciousness of rape."
1,A typical US-feminist publication,"This book is typical for many of its kind, just a man-hating drivel from feminists...and otherwise good for nothing."
4,string thing,"My son had one of these several years ago. I broke it, accidentally, by smashing a door on it. I really thought he was over it, but, even at the age of 14 he still wanted it. Now he plays with the dog the the string thing. The dog seems to really like it too."
4,Pretty neat,"My sons played with a version of this toy at the Maker's Faire in San Mateo this past summer so I wanted to find one for xmas. I couldn't find the more powerful version from the show but this one is a pretty good substitute. The string is colorful, especially with the black light. It makes neat shapes and my kids like how the string ""bounces"" off the floor. The motor is loud but it would be tough to make one that's quiet."
1,Defective product,The product is inherently defective it breaks shortly after its first use. Just save your money and avoid this purchase.
2,"Kind of neat, but mostly frustrating.","Really not impressed with this toy. So you hold this thing that's spinning some colorful string. If you try to aim it UP, it gets tangled and shuts off. If you touch something with the string it gets tangled and shuts off. If you wave it around, it gets tangled and shuts off. Luckily the tangles are usually easy to get out, but still, this is quite annoying.Really can't recommend it at this time."
2,wimpy string thing,"Didn't much care for it, the ribbon one is better. The black light is cool. The string jammed in the housing and had to take it apart. Kids lost interest in it quick."
1,Doesn't work,"We bought this toy from a local toy store and it broke within 10 minutes. We start the toy, the string immediately knots up, and the toy stops. We fix the knot, start the toy again, the string immediately knots up, and the toy stops working again. I'm throwing it out now. Very disappointing to my son to receive a toy that absolutely doesn't work."
4,Kinda cool!,"We saw this at a toy store in Frankenmuth, Mi. My kids thought it was really cool, and it is. Fun too. I wasn't going to spend $26.00 for it there, but found it here for $17.00. Worth the price, careful not to tangle the line though!"
2,"Began to fall apart as the first day wore on, pretty much useless now.","See the title of this review. String- gets in a knot, then balled up, then you have to take it apart. Imagine this over and over again, until it is unserviceable. Even if this was not the case, the lights are offset, so they do not shine directly on the string enough to keep the effect constant. Would NOT buy again."
3,"Not much for metal- Not bad, though.","So,I got this a few months ago expecting an odd metal album. I mean, they did compare it to Dissection so I had to try. Anyhoo, save for a couple of songs, it is pretty mellow. Not a fast BMalbum that I expected. For the record, I know that I set myself up for failure. Nothing ventured, nothing gained, right? All said and done, it IS a good album. You just have to listen to it a few times and keep reminding yourself that not all un-metal music is bad. The lyrics do get cheesy sometimes but the metal on there IS killer. The instruments in this music are an odd mixbut as long as you have open tastes in music, it will make you happy. The songwriting is killer, too. When (and if) I get home,I'll put this on and try to get some booty as long as my wife does not hear these joyful lyrics."
3,Vocal travesty,"Great album!! - only one problem - the Vocals!!Most of the vocal parts use digital processing making the voice sound like a cross between a snake, satan, and a sci-fi monster. If were used just once or in just one song that would be one thing, but it really gets old fast.SSSSttthhuuuppeeerrrr SSttthhhhttttuuupppiiiddd SSttthhhooouuunnddddssss.Where this effect isn't used the vocals are just weak - which is fine because the band is so good. Why they chose that effect I will never know.For this style I think either of Riverside's albums are a better choice. But the music is very srong here and it does take you on a journey."
3,Functional doom metal,"My title should say it all - this is a functional, doom metal album that is quite pleasing to the ear but breaks no new ground. The band manages to conjure up a melancholic, doom-laden atmosphere throughout, but the devices employed are all the same - the ringing acoustic guitar intro, the whooshing of a background wind, followed by the obligatory power chord riffing. My tastes run from Black Sabbath, Uriah Heep and Judas Priest to today's heavyweights like Dream Theater, Fates Warning and Metallica. In terms of musicianmanship, Agalloch come nowhere close to any of these bands and neither do they provide full melodic satisfaction. You'll listen to this CD, but you won't hum long - during, or after."
2,Kind of boring. Much room to grow as a band.,"I wasn't quite as taken with this band as others. The vocals do not bother me, but the guitar is not great; and the music is a bit too redundant. While I can understand the comparison to Opeth, they have a long way to go to even come close to the musical mastery of the boys from Germany. That being said, Allagoch has great potential, perhaps achieved with better production."
2,Amateurish Americans,"As an American myself, I bought this partially due to curiosity. Most of the bands in the goth/dark/death/and so on metal are Scandinavian. I wish I could say that this CD lives up to the European standards, but it does not. It's not that this is a bad disc, but that bands like Opeth are so much better. Lyrically, musically, thematically, this band just doesn't measure up to the standards of the genre today."
1,"I hoped to like it, but I got rid of it after one listen.","Sorry Jason, but I just can't get into this cd.I found it kind of boring and could not stand the clean vocals.The clean vocals are what really did it for me, I was trying to get into it, but when he sings, it's just so bland.There are two reasons that I bought it:1. Good reviews? Everyone likes this cd, but in retrospect, I should have known it wasn't for me because I think Opeth are also kind of boring.2. I know the bass player, but that doesn't change my opinion."
4,Metal mood music,"Yup, metal mood music -- the songs are long and slowly build up. Not for head-banging, more for introspection. I have really enjoyed this CD."
5,Melancholy beauty,"This is one of the most brilliant albums I have ever come across. Since this album is made up of mostly acoustic, slow paced riffage.. it seems rather wrong to classify this as metal. Sure there are some black metal 'screeching' vocals way behind the mix every once and a while, but personally, I look at this album as more of a atmospheric progressive rock ablum.The entire preformance is layered with reverb, giving it a ghostly sound, accompanied by melancholy vocals and a slight tinge of almost isis-esque musicianship. Though this is structurally a simple album aimed more at atmosphere than anything else, there are still brilliant moments of wonderful guitar solos, space-rock like effects, and swelling dynamics.Nothing here is overdone, nothing is overly repetitive, and nothing seems out of place. A must have for any fan of atmospheric music.. metal or not."
5,"It's a five-star book, but...",...it's been obsoleted by its own fouth edition. No place on the listing for this book do I find a hint that this is the third edition of a book currently in its FOURTH edition. They renamed the book The Little Schemer for the fourth revision. Buy that book instead.
3,reviewing though times,"Excellent portrait & critic of the so famous ""special period in peace times"" (periodo especial en tiempo de paz)long lived in Cuba under Castro's command. You must carefully look for & realize the magnitude of the critic shown in every part of the film. The recurrent fried eggs meant shortage of beef, the chained cuttlery meant no place to buy them, making them an easy stollen item, etc. The final explosion of sulfur? Try to guess. It's nothing less than the desire of freedom of this people."
3,Cute but it turned yellow.,I like that it's big and looks mysterious almost. It isn't uncomfortable to wear even with its size. I just didn't like that it turned yellow after a month or so. I tried using silver cleaner but it didn't help that much. After a while the yello started to look more tarnished and ended up looking like rust even though it wasn't.
1,King Authur's Britian Ignores Facts,"Francis Pryor's archaeoligical approach is NOT like most. He chooses to ignore evidence that doesn't fit with his beliefs. This was a huge disappointment. If you are looking for a serious approach to this subject, keep looking."
1,Useless,"8 out of the 23 pages consisted of copyright information. There was a single paragraph summary of the whole book, and the rest of the ebook contained suggestions for further reading. Please don't make the mistake I did in buying this ebook or any other ""summaries"" that Gale Publishing Group offers."
1,Poor quality,"Overall, I was dissatisfied. Shirt was thin. Decal was small and not centered properly. Amazon gave me no trouble with the return."
5,"Robert Gant, Chad Allen and Judith Light? who could ask for a better cast and they deliver","I've always been a fan of Chad Allen from his ""Donald Strachey"" mystery films, and of course Robert Gant from ""Kiss Me Deadly"" and Queer as Folk. Here they prove again why there are easy on the eyes and of course are great actors. Add in Tony Award winning actress Judith Light and the bar is raised and they rise to the challenge. The story could have easily been a 2 dimensional exercise in characters dealing with their homosexuality and a couple trying to show them the ""straight path"". But the writer, director and especially the cast make this a 2 sided affair showing both sides without making either one the villain. Excellent performances by all and an ending that is well liked by the viewer."
5,Love at first note.,"I'm not sure if this is supposed to be serious or hilarious, but every song I have heard so far from this cd make me laugh. It has simple yet great sounding music. At first, I thought the singer was a child until the cuss words started flowing. This is some of that music you can listen to and laugh with your friends and have a good time. The ""rapping"" I guess is what'd you call it is fast enough to keep you hooked but slow enough that every word is clear and followable and to me that means a lot."
1,You have got to be kidding,"I could have slapped myself for buying this. If you believe this is IDM, you are missing something. This is amateurish and just bad music. I assume that the 5 star reviewers got this for free with some real music thrown in. Some of the beats are ok until the girls ruin in with their attempt at singing. Needless to say, I was really disappointed. Definitely listen to all of this first before you buy. Mine will be another one of those on the used list for a penny soon."
3,"Good, but could have been much better","The concept for this book is quite smart: a compilation of memorable snippets from classic TV, such as classic quotes, lyrics to TV theme songs, catch phrases and words of wisdom. This could have been a gem if executed properly.As some of the other reviewers have said, there are some glaring mistakes, a few off-kilter quotes, and some good opportunities missed. But overall the book achieves its mission, which is to pay homage to the TV of our youth.I especially like the words of wisdom, i.e. ""You can't take a step forward with two feet on the ground."" - Mike Brady (The Brady Bunch), and the page on how to turn into Wonder Woman.Overall it is a nostalgic, fun read, but certainly not the end-all. It could have been SO much more."
3,cyclone o' fun,"This is a good product for its price. Perfect conversion paddle for a player moving from pips out to pips in rubber. The paddle is kinda heavy, its rubber isnt very tacky, and the handle is solid. This is not for the pros, or ever intermediate players. I actually have three of these paddles and I use them to train my friends who are new to pingpong. Getting down the basics of spin, serves, and slams with rubber is made easier by this soft non-sticky rubber. Although most people will tell beginners to buy and expensive paddle and train to its level i disagree. Spinny rubber is fun to play with, but it also is hard to control opposition's spin when you are new to the game. This is the perfect conversion, and it gets a plus from me. If you are new to rubber, this is the paddle for you!"
3,Decent product at a good price,Product could be more durable. Been used about a dozen times and have noticed paddle now has an thumb indention. Descent paddle for recreational use. Worth the money.
1,Sexist,"I found Schaef's views sexist to both men and women. I found her views outdated and an overraction. I do believe there is a White Male System but I think she has overanalyzed certain actions of men in their attempt to suppress women. It seems that everything men do, say, believe are ways to control women. I find this impossible. According to her, all men are bad and all women are angry. I know wonderful men who do not give in to this system. Also, I'm not angry about being a woman. I have seen how women rights have come leaps and bounds through history. I also don't believe she gives enough credit to the unique differences between men and women. These differences should be celebrated not picked apart and translated as whys men are opressing women."
1,Feminist Propaganda,"Obviously this was written for people that live before the liberated 60's. Outdated and inane, it pits a men vs women mentality rather than the harmony that should prevail due to the differences. The differences is what makes a union strong as well as the similarities. Maybe we should have all been born with both sex organs but there is a separation for a reason."
5,Wonderful! Fantastic! Great!,"So why are white males so threatened by Women? Why do they want to prevent us from succeeding?? This book is careful not to hurt their feelings too much, but let's face it: cowardly white males are trying to keep us from achieving our goals, and they do it through sexism (and thus racism). As a white Woman (and law student), I empathize with African Americans as they challenge white males and their agenda of hate. All white males need to learn to treat Women with respect; after all, Women's innate skills and thinking strategies are superior to that of males in contemporary society; someday white males will need Affirmative Action! When I see some twenty-something white male, thinking he deserves all the world's wealth, all of the world's priviledge, I just want to throw up...."
5,POWERFUL,"I found this book to be a POWERFUL awakener for ALL women. It will take your blinders off completely and show you the 'game' the white male society plays on all women and all people of other races. After reading this book, you'll be very angry at how you've been duped -- BUT YOU WILL NEVER BE FOOLED INTO THINKING YOU'RE INFERIOR AGAIN."
1,Some sellers just send different cable than the one in image,Some sellers just send different cable than the one in image.They send regular cable. In description there is coaxial cable. Because of that some customers are not happy with signal quality.
4,25 Foot Component audio video cable gold,It arrived on time and functions well. No need for spending four times as much at a local store when this product fits the need(s) quite well.
1,Scan Lines,"Cables are thin, the lack in shielding causes scan lines on my screen. Unusable.I will be returning these cables."
2,Noisy Cables,These cables carry a lot of noise. Dissapointed in quality. If the cable has signal loss at this length then why are they sold?
2,Looks like a quality cable,This cable set looks to be of good quality and construction but I cannot get a signal and not really sure why. I think it may be due to the length and maybe my knowledge of what is required for a long cable like this. Maybe some type of signal booster is required. I would rate 5 stars if I had a signal.
5,Standard Cable,The connectors are in quality and well constructed. It works well with my TV. Very useful and I was happy with that.
2,Didn't work well for me,I think this is a pretty low end and cheap cable. I ran it in my attic and it the picture had a tremendous amount of static. I replaced it with a higher quality cable and the problem went away. I was using it for the HD connection to my TV from my HD DVR and it did not work for me.
5,Drama Ministry,Just what I needed to organize my thoughts on starting a drama ministry at our church. It gave me the confidence to go forward.
5,Change is the Only Constant for My Small Business,An invaluable guide and a true eye opening experience. My small business means constant change and knowledge of my people. This book is very helpful and informative. As a small business owner it is critical that I find the right people and that they are in the best roles. This book has changed the way I look at my people and potential hires. If you want to improve your personnel assessment and feel confident facing the challenges of business life this is a must read.
4,Her Own Rules,easy read. not as good as Women of Substance but held my interest. have read many of Barbara Taylor Bradford's books and this was and enjoyable read.
1,Inn 101,"Thanks for the tips on decorating a fancy inn, Ms Barbara! I've you to thank if I ever get into the business. Success will be mine.Other than interior design and renovation, there wasn't much to this book. A triggered memory here, a psychogenic fatigue there, and a sappy reunion to top it all off. Seemingly the really important thing is impressing your hotel guests with all your finishing touches, cause that was 80% of this novel. Not even exaggerating. If that sounds like fun to you, give this book a try."
3,idealistic but fun,"This book was fun to read but Barbara Taylor Bradford usually leads us way beyond the everyday realities of life. Her heroine (as usual) is beautiful and bright and is an awesome business tycoon (even though she has no education, training, or experience in these matters). She becomes a perfect mother, friend, and homemaker. Unlike most of us, her very sad past never seems to daunt her ability to rise above all. This is a perfect book for idealists."
2,A slightly Pretentious book,"I was not that impressed with this debut novel. It had its moments, but overall I thought it was lacking on many levels. Not to my expectations. Better luck next time."
2,Two stars.,"Ambitious, but stiff. Cool in places, but rambling in others. Editors and agents may be to blame."
2,"Will somebody edit this guy, please!","Conrad's novel is ambitious, I'll give it that much. But the excruciatingly stilted, stifling prose combined with an almost obsessive desire to catalog meaningless trivia hurts this book a great deal. It's readable, but not very rewarding The descriptions of Chicago, a city I lived in for many years, seem like they were lifted from a guidebook. Good idea, woefully pretentious execution."
1,"Obviously, A First Novel","Joseph Conrad strikes me as a writer who takes himself way too seriously. His novel reads more like the journal of a young writer who is discovering his sexuality and trying to emulate other, successful writers. I found the references to the city and ""writing culture"" incredibly cliche. It seems to me that Conrad is trying to tell his own life story through his characters, and the result is flaky, one-dimensional personalities that remain distant from the audience. The entire nuclear issue seems to be thrown into the narrative almost as an afterthought--something to make the entire story ""important,"" and is wholly unrealistic and forced. I had to force myself to continue reading this book and couldn't even finish the last few pages. It was painfully obvious that this is Conrad's first novel."
4,Surprisingly Entertaining,"I'll have to admit when I picked this book up, I had my doubts, love and nuclear waste don't seem to be the best of combinations. My doubts were shortlived. It was with supream surprise and delight that I devoured Conrad's prose as swiftly as possible.The cast of charactors in this book borders on epic. Conrad works a kind of magic as he gently weaves the stories of each of the many charactors into an interconected whole, leaving you wondering if life has an almost ironic order after all."
1,Blackxploitation redux,This is nothing less than the story of an African American man's struggle to define himself within the context of the 60's US black power movement exploited by a white Englishman. Mike Marqusee brings nothing new to the story of Muhamed Ali other than stilted prose and an uncritical eye. It fails as a book about boxing and is equally weak with respect to Ali's struggle with the white establishment of his day. Marqusee's attempt to embrace Ali's story serves only to water down the true struggle of an entire generation against the evils of institutional racism.
2,poor suction,"I bought this pump at a local retailer. It worked fine for the first few weeks. I would wash the ""breast cups"" taking the inside ring apart from the outside (milk gets stuck underneath) and now I can't always get it to work. What a waste of money. I would have rather bought a high dollar one like I used in the hospital and know it would work when I needed it to."
1,Money is better spent elsewhere.....,"My husband went and purchased this one for me while I was still in the hospital, instead of listening to the one I wanted he got the cheaper one....Men. I told him there was a reason that all the other double electric pumps were 150.00 and above. This one is hard to hold in place, it's awkward and you have to press it against your breast really hard. The suction is not sufficient. It will only pump about 2 oz and then stops. Not to mention it takes close to 20 minutes to pump that 2 oz. It's very loud, and tends to back up in the tubing if your not paying explicit attention to the machine. The only thing good I can say about it is that the cups are comfortable. But that doesn't make it worth wasting you money on...buy a good one and save the time and money."
1,Stop working the sixth time I used it,I had my first child and was looking forward to breast feeding but this was the only pump they had at the store and it quit on me. I was so disapointed because I had to take water pills and was unable to breast feed at that time. When the pump failed I dryed up and now cannot breast feed my child.
1,Ouch!,This pump hurts! I wasted my money on this and had to go buy a Medela instead. It's worth the money to buy a good pump!
1,Don't bother.,"Not wanting to spend big bucks on a Medela, I bought this pump instead. It is very loud; it looses suction if it is not perfectly lined up and pressed hard against my chest; it has very little suction (I put it on its highest setting to be useful at all); it literally rubs me raw when I use it even when I use Lansinoh with it; and the pump quit after 2 dozen uses. Loud, painful, difficult to use, doesn't work well, and it broke. If you're only going to pump occassionally, you're better off getting a good manual pump (doing one side at a time with a good manual pump will take about the same time as using this). I threw this away and bought a Medela Pump In Style which has been wonderful!"
4,GREAT but Noisy,"This pump is great, it isn't uncomfortable or painful but I'd love it even more if it wasn't so noisy since I have to pump while my daughter's asleep. I found though, tht if you put it on a soft surface and maybe cover it with a blanket, the noisy isn't so bad. I'll give it 9/10."
5,Sparkling clean fountain!,This product is working very well in keeping our fountain clear and algae free. I hope it does this well through the warmer summer months!The price on Amazon was better than any other online. It was even cheaper than the product's own website.
2,Not working,"Not sure what I'm doing wrong with these, but even starting with a clean fountain, the algae seems to ignore the block completely. They turn grey and then algae grows right on the block! Maybe I have developed a resistant strain of super-aggressive algae."
1,Christianity is not to blame for anti-Semitism,Crossan is missing the point. No one killed Jesus. He chose to give His life on the cross. To tie Christianity with anti-Semitism is ludicrous. I can not believe that one man would dedicate so much time to such heresy.
5,An unforgettable Story,"I think this book is an enlightment to one's spiritual stage in life and teaches us the true faith of christianity. Whether people may think it is anti-semetic or not, the truth remains. The fact that it occured can not be hidden nor would it be forgotten to the christians. Overall to me the book was a good guide to those saught to learn. I give great credit to the author."
2,I feel sorry for him.,"JD Crossan is an ex-priest and product of the 1960s who left his vocation. Time and time we see this associated with a pathological sense of guilt as is sadly shown by this book. Though clearly talanted, Crossan's personal sense of shame/guilt cloud his reason. His drivel continues in his other works. Look to other writers on Jesus to get healthier analysis of Jesus."
2,Boring,"As a Dominate, into the scene for over 25 years, and living in a 24/7 with my submissive, I find this book to be the most boring book on the subject I have read in a long time. The book has entries that skip all over the place, and really tells the reader nothing."
1,Thumbs Down for Literacy,"I couldn't even get through this book, it is sooooo poorly written...if you care the least about words, grammar, sytax, details, and compelling story, this so is not the book for you..."
3,"Interesting lifestyle, character but mixed execution","This book is a reprint of a real live slave's journal. This work affords an opportunity to peer into the life of one of the few people whom have had the courage and strength to devote themselves to true 24x7 servitude.However, you should be prepared for the fact that a slave's journal is not intended to be literary masterpiece and you will often find yourself wishing for more detail about events or the thoughts of others.It is rare to get a real, unhyped view into the hardcore S&M scene, which makes this book potentially interesting. However, just like many things, real life isn't always as exciting as fantasy."
5,wartime baseball,"This is a fascinating book because it combines the drama of a murder mystery, sabotage, and baseball against a backdrop of American fear of German culture during World War I. I found the social commentary fascinating, and wondered about the accuracy of the times. Our hero (Mickey Rawlings) is trying to solve the murder of a teammate with the misfortune of having a German name. He gets involved in a anti-German society that sounds like the Ku Klux Klan, rubbing elbows with some scary hatemongers. He also gets involved with some suspicious baseball team owners. When other bodies start to fall, the mystery deepens. Throughout it all, Mickey is struggling with his patriotic duty versus his love for the game of baseball.I loved this book."
1,"the best of: florida keys,the",very disappointing! really not worth the $25.oovery short- not much informationno help in planning a trip
3,Good but new?,"This book is basic information backed up with Scripture and the life of the person struggling successfully (mostly) with this balance in life. I appreciate the fact that Mr. Gelsinger is willing to share through speaking and writing his own journey in this area. Though the concepts are not new, it helps to know that someone with a ""Type A"" driven personality can actually balance family, faith and work.A question--Is there a Michael Smalley? I only know of Gary. Is that a son?A suggestion--get a good editor for organization and sentence structure.A review--This is a helpful book for those on this journey."
1,Pat Gelsinger - Egomaniac at large,"Pat tells you in the book, ""I was prone to overstate my accomplishments while sometimes demeaning the work of others."" This statement reflects the tone of this book. It's a boring autobiography about Pat's accomplishments, successes and achievements in his life. It's his opportunity to boast to the world how perfect he is. There are many more books available on this same topic that offer outstanding advice."
5,A clear path to follow,"I have read this book and i have to say it's one of the few that I have read several times. This book provides simple and clear guidance on how to achieve a sound spiritual connection with the Source. It's universal language also makes it a wonderful book for anyone who consideres him/herself spiritual and in search for Truth. I also can appreciate its non pretencious langage style, which makes me feel at ease regardless of where I at in my level of understanding. What i also liked about it was that it's not a ""feel good book and just see things positively'"", rather it provides realistic ways to address and combat the everyday ups and dows and struggles in life.i feel as though the author has really taken the time to research the subject and lay out usable examples and explanations for things that effect us as human beings. Highly recommended..."
5,Sweaty hands,"Moved from the southern US to the Northern US and wanted to continue bike commuting. Struggled for two years trying to keep my fingers warm while trying various gloves. This product has saved my fingers and my hands actually sweat in temps below twenty while bicycling to work in arctic MN. Over thirty degrees, these gloves are too warm if exercising."
3,"Unique,sweet, soft, envriornmentally responsible little toy","These little guys are adorable and unique. Plus, as a child grows, you can explain the importance of organic/environmentally responsible materials."
3,bad digital quality,"The book itself is brillaint. However I purchased the digital version (Kindle), which contains mistakes: wrong characters, missing sentences, mixed up pages. Amazon refunded the price, but I still don't have the book...."
4,Learn and benefit from this NLP book,"This is a good intro to NLP book, you can Learn and benefit from it by simply reading it, or it may whet your appetite to pursue this powerful science of the mind further."
1,Where's the Proof?,"I taught classroom NLP for years, and I'm offended by this so-called self-help book. NLP is found by John Grinder, and in its purest form has been misused and misrepresented. Everybody claims to practice NLP as a result of Tony Robbins. This book should have focused more on the real NLP techniques. See Tony's Unlimited Power. It's much better."
5,Great variety!!,"All kind of wild animals patterns are there with an approach to cuteness.I love knitting and it is not difficult for me to reproduce these animals, but other people may find them complicated to knit."
4,good,book has a lot of pictures and instructions are easy to follow. A lot of cute animals and animal keepers to make
3,"great ideas, but poorly conveyed","I am an intermediate knitter and was excited to find this book online. It has many great animals to knit, some that are rather quirky. However, I find her patterns to be somewhat difficult to follow. When she refers to rows she seems to include both the knit and purl rows into one row, which I haven't seen before, so when she says ""work 10 rows"" you're really working 20. It makes the patterns confusing. I have a friend who is working on the zebra and has also run into technical errors."
4,Very realistic,"I love the realism of these toys. However, I am not a big fan of seaming and these have LOTS of pieces. I modified some of the patterns for knitting in the round, but have not actually done any of the animals. I highly recommend this book if you dont mind seaming, and it is the most realistic book I have found thus far. It goes by location, farm animals, jungle animals, australian animals, sea animals, ect. LOVE the book, just not all the work."
5,Glee!,"I love the projects in this book! Where else are you going to find a pattern for a warthog, a wombat, or a duck-billed platypus? I've made 3 of them so far and the patterns are easy, clearly written and so much fun to make. I can't wait to make all of them.The only issue I've had is that some of them are small, but I don't think I'll have much of a problem sizing them up.Great great great buy!"
4,A Treasure Trove!,"I don't own this book myself...yet. I borrowed it from the library to see if I liked a few of the patterns, and it turns out I like nearly ALL of them.As someone who has been a world traveler and has friends with children all over the globe, I appreciate patterns for things like koalas and wombats, which you would probably never find anywhere else unless you invented them yourself.This book is a total delight!"
4,Great book for knitters with a bit more experience,"I love knitting. I've been an avid knitter for 25 years. And I found this book to be delightfully creative. The layout is wonderful. There are pictures of each project at completion, which is something I look for in knitting books. I like to have that visual in mind as I knit. There are ratings for each project ranging from easy to straightforward (involving a bit more complexity) to challenging. The ratings also include helpful information such as age appropriateness of the finished project.I did find that piecing together the items was a bit awkward at times. I think that, using some different stitches, the pieces could be shaped so that there is not so much sewing at the end. However, this has no bearing on the appearance of the completed project.I've used this book quite a bit for making gifts, and the recipients are always thrilled."
5,Penguin!,"Some excellent patterns here, like the penguin and the sea turtle. I've also made the parrot, and they all turned out well. There are plenty more I would like to make, like the dolphin and the brown bear."
2,I wanted small animals to play with.,"The back cover states the book has patterns for more than 50 animals to be knit in two sizes: that is not true. All the animals are huge. I could see knitting one. Even the pictures of the animals on the cover give the appearance of being a series of small animals children could use for imaginative play. There a couple of small animals, but even the babies in this book are all large stuffed animals. The statement on the back is essentially false, and I am very disappointed. I know lots and lots of people who would have been interested in this many patterns for small (a few inches) animals."
3,Alright ideas...,"There are some cute ideas in here, but the major fluctuations in scale are just annoying. Also, none of the patterns are knitted in the round, which would make much more sense and you wouldn't have these big ugly scars on one side of every animal."
4,pretty [parrot] patterns,"I bought this book for just one pattern - the parrot!! But I have been excited by a lot of the other ideas. The Mountie may be next on the list. However, in actual fact, I find that the finished toys are on the basic side. Being an experiemced knitter and toymaker. I am able to make the improvements that I feel are needed.Overall I would recommend this book for anyone who wished to make toys that are a bit different: experienced knitters would value it for the ideas but its real value is for those people who have a little knitting experience. Especially valuable is the authors notes at the beginningof each toy pattern as to the level of difficulty.Definitely a book worth its payment."
5,Heavenly,"I first bought the cassette version of this tape in 1988. It quickly became my children's favorite to play while rocking them to sleep. I am now purchasing a copy for my sister and her new baby, and a copy for my children, so they will use it with their children in the future. We especially love the songs: Waltzing with Bears and Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John."
3,Very interesting history of New Jersey towns,"Having hailed from this part of New Jersey, I was very interested in learning of its history and development. The book was very informative, but I wish it had contained even more information, particularly about Fort Monmouth. All-in-all, I felt it was very well done."
2,Universal Dissapointment,"The Mummy and the Creature are just OK. Frankenstein and Dracula are ridiculous. below par story adaptions and amateur art work. Universal Monsters really deserve greater respect and much more imaginative treatment than this book can offer. I cannot understand the Universal Studios endorsement. Have they seen this book? This book should have been much, much better. It's not alive. It stinks."
1,Wrong person,I don't even like the Bellamy Brothers. I did not purchase this product.I don't even like the Bellamy Brothers. I did not purchase this product.I don't even like the Bellamy Brothers. I did not purchase this product.
5,Adorable party hats,Arrived in great condition and they are perfect for the occasion. Very cute! Perfect for a little girls birthday party. I especially like that they don't have a character. Perfect pink!
1,The cover is misleading,You don't see anything. The girls don't do anything. Half of the movie you can't see anything because its so dark.if you are thinking about seeing this movie because of the cove don't.they are cute but they don't do anything that you will talk about.
2,poor excuse to see hot chiks,"the chiks are so damn hot....but it doesn't woth it, save your money or buy any playboy dvd"
2,What was i thinking,"This movie is for people that love horror types of movies i'm not one of them, what was i thinking."
1,0 STARS: Horrible acting and a totally stupid movie!,"One look at the cover of this DVD should let anyone know what they are getting with ""Candystripers"". This movie is a total zero as far as horror is concerned. Several highschool basketball players get injured and have to stay in a hospital for a little while. However, some creature (kind of like the creeps) enters through the mouth of the candystripers, and that candystripers start killing people and spinning their webs over all of the male hospital occupants. If this movie seems as stupid as it sounds, well, you are absolutely right!! Horrible acting, a stupid plot and sheer absurdity mark this flick as more of an unintentional comedy than horror, but with Playboy playmates in it, what should I expect? Do not waste your money on this garbage...luckily, I just wasted 90 minutes of my life watching this junk on T.V. Yes, I was really, really bored out of my mind tonight, and that is the only reason I actually sat through this rubbish!"
3,A Disappointment,"The gauge seems accurate, but the product description does not reveal that the plunger that gives the reading does not remain exposed when the gauge is removed from the valve stem. Hence, unless you can read the gauge during the actual measurement, it is useless."
2,Edox Les Bemontas Watch,"Hi,Was a bit disappointed with the watch received as it looked worn to me and it was advertised as ""new"". However, the packaging was great and that was a consolation.Regards,Juliet Peh"
4,Rock-A-Billy Rock,"Rockin' Just another great disc from the ""That'll Flat Get It"" series. As with all the cds in this series, the booklet inside has lots of great info about the artisit, songs and so much more. These are a must for Rock-A-Billy fans that want to expand their musical library.The Mean Eyed CatKNON Radio 89.3Dallas, Texas"
1,Very bad,"It's the worst shopping in my experience. The book was so old, dirty and not interesting. I dont feel like I spent the right amount on this book . Feel really upset"
4,"True ""science"" fiction, classical in construction. Want More","This story offers a traditionally-constructed approachconsisting of 3-dimensional people with human motivations andrelationships and built upon a solid-appearing foundation of scientific principles. I delight in extrapolations based on current societal conditions and trends. This author has such a ""John Brunner""-like ability, without sinking into the dark dead-end gloominess of the nihilistic. The only negative I care to mention is that I hate finding a series like this at the git-go, because I then have to wait impatiently on the rest of the author's work. I recall such impatience with Juanita Coulson, for one. :) I'd say this book is worth the price paid and requires little effort to read because it is so engrossing. I'm also keeping it on the shelf to read again just prior to reading the next installment."
2,Disappointed and overwhelmed,"I like ""airplane"" books, but I could have flown around the world and not have finished this one. It was too long, it had too many characters, and it took on too many issues. I know the sequels are here, but I wasn't left with the burning desire to order them. The characters were unbelievable, both too trite and too inconsistent. The goals of the principal, a poor little rich girl with a vapid, yet all controlling mother, were supposed to save the world if achieved. The premises were ok for sci-fi, but they didn't go anywhere. Unfortunately, the inclusion of critical events taking place on both Yugoslavian battlefields and the Mir spacecraft turned out to be rather silly in the light of recent real events in both of those locales. I was totally turned off by the inner-city episodes. They sounded more like an apology than a literary creation of credible human drama. I'll look elsewhere for my reading entertainment."
3,Some strong points,The execution is very good except for the relationships. His development of romantic relations among his characters is bad -- and perfunctory. Does he put them in because he thinks that he's expected to?The themes of developing the space program and schools are nicely done. His discipline keeps those themes controlled despite his obvious passion for them.Good job -- lose the romance sub-plots.
2,"Had promise, squandered promise to become propaganda tract","This could have been a great book. The first 300 pages had a lot of promise... the next 300 pages were mediocre, and the last 300 pages made me wonder whether I was reading a ""hard science fiction"" novel or a libertarian tract. And to think there will be a bunch more of these novels? Yawn!The promise was there, but oh, how it was squandered. Don't read this book for the science fiction; read this book if you're interested in a vastly simplified near-future utopian epic with cardboard, cliche-riddled characters and ""oh wouldn't it be nice"" pining. Blah."
2,a totally wrong prediction,If you believed like the author of this book that the businessmen of a free market capitalism will be the ones that will revitalize the space program just look at the last 9 yeras of USA history. There was a lot of free market and businessmen but have you seen any progress in the space program? NO what you have seen is a big economic crisis! NO Mr Flynn the problem of the space pogram is not the liberals or the enviromentalists etc. This is a well written book but totally wrong in its premise. I wonder when the citizens of this country will stop hunting ghosts like the bad reds or the bad liberals etc
2,Railroad Switch Keys & Padlocks,"Book is not worth the $100 price tag. Prices are dated (which was to be expected), but the whole of the information is not so complete. Locks and keys from most common railroads are included; as are some from defunct and smaller roads. However, there are large gaps in the information with many roads missing. I expected data to be more complete to justify the price."
4,Nice educational tool,"I was actually surprised by how enjoyable this game is. I've played it in our home as well as with the catechism class I teach.It's educational and can serve as a nice ice-breaker in a classroom setting. You can play it at novice, intermediate, advanced levels that keep it interesting, and finishes in a short enough time that prevents it from dragging on or becoming tedious. I consider this a worthwhile game to have."
1,1,"my jop is survayor in arraba munacibality ,so ineed this book to read only ,and i know about international low . please help me . thanks"
3,Its fun,"I enjoyed the first rainbox six so I thought I wud take a chance on this one expecially since it was so cheap. I also have the new Rainbox 6 360 games, so compared to those the graphics are seriously inferior. But the game is difficult and fun, I dont regret spending $4 and the game plays on the 360, a big plus."
3,"Not spectacular, but it was ok.","Some parts of it was fine, but some were just flat out frustrating. I didni't like going on ""lone wolf"" missions because the fun of the game is in commanding my squad to do things for me. Wish they could have done what I told them to do perfectly, but, it's a game. And no game is perfect. It's still a fun play though. A bit difficult and frustrating in some places, but still a fun play."
4,Rainbow Six 3: Black Arrow,"This is a great game for anyone who likes spec-ops. Recommend for adults who like Splinter Cell and not children- this is NOT Halo, and I'm not talking High Altitude Low Open canopy. A game where babysitting is out of the question."
1,Total crap!,"As a big fan of B-Movies and Troma films, I need to warn others. This was garbage, nothing was good about this movie. Cleaning my cats liter box this morning was more fun than watching this film."
1,smaller than actual size,"this product is smaller than actual size. i ordered a 12, which is my true size, but i needed a 13 instead. I returned the product instead of exchanging for the bigger size because i didn't like the high heal on the back and i decided that i wanted a pair that i could wear outside also. Plus, it wasn't that comfy with or without socks. The black L.B. Evans Boulevard slipper is more comfy, especially without sox, it actually fits true to size, and you can wear it outside also because the bottom street-like sole on it. :)"
4,Poe it On,"This is a good, low-key modern country/pop album from Michelle Poe. It is heavy on sweet, mellow ballads. Michelle's voice is good and she sings those well. There are 2 more rockin' numbers on here: Love City and Just One of the Boys. Good CD"
2,"A Myopic, Self-Centered, Antisemitic View of Hasidism","The author begins the book questioning whether the locals are antisemitic or just leary of strangers. As the book progresses, it becomes more and more obvious that the only person who is clearly antisemtic in this entire book is the author himself. The book is his own journey of self discovery, in the process of which the author seems to discover quite clearly that he is extremely uncomfortable with all things truly Jewish. In the end, this book does, unfortunately, a pretty good job of promoting an antisemitic view of traditional culture, a view that only leads to prejudice. Had the other been less caught up in his myopic world view, and more focused on the true clash in cultures in front, he would have produced a much more honest, valuable, and object work."
4,Bloom is not biased!,"Much has already been said about this book's writings. I feel that had it been written a topic totally foriegn to me, due to the author's attention to detail and introspection,it would have maintained the same level of interest. I also don't feel that Bloom's writing about the Lubavitcher Chasidim is dishonest or deliberately hurtful. While it often unpleaseant; this was the reality that was given to him. Considering the self-congratulatory syle of writing that is so rife in the Orthodox Jewish world, it is a fair counterweight to such tomes.I am an Orthodox Jew, and I do not feel that his view of Lubativch Jews is biased at all. That Bloom mentions his own distance from such Orthodoxy does not disqualify his emotions or views. Bloom's point that many in such groups will try to defend themselves using mechanism and guilt and aggresiveness, remains vaild-as some of these reviews prove. It is a shame that some people can't take criticism, and must twist it to be slander."
3,Half a loaf (of challah),"In some ways, this book is an interesting exploration of the clash of cultures. But it suffers from very amateurish, first-person writing. This is particularly the case when the author describes himself as a Jew out of his element in Iowa, and when he waxes rhapsodically about maintaining his Jewishness by occasionally eating bagels, lox, and matzoh ball soup. If you are utterly fascinated with Judaism in America, this book is worth reading -- it's quick and easy. If you want sophistication, you will be disappointed."
5,It's not just Iowa......It's everywhere,"I read Postvile and was mesmerized as the authors guides you through an amazing story of how he explores the crazy relationship between long resident Iowa Lutherans and New York Lubavich Jews and his own identity as a Jew. The story gives an interesting insite into this Ultra-Orthodox sect of Judism. The story is easily a metaphor for every culture that has ""been invaded"" and often, in vain, tries to hold onto their roots. GREAT READ."
1,Coulda been a Contender,"Of course, every writer comes to the keyboard with his/her own preudices.But the detached writer--the true artist--suspends those biases in favor of an accurate portrayal of fact. Others just skim the surface, conveying their impressions. But sans context,such reportage is at the very least grossly distorted. Bloom, a nonreligious ..., seems to have come to this work with absolutely no background research...except perhaps memories of Fiddler on the Roof. But,like the Chasid on the cover of the book, Tevye was not a Lubavitcher (and possibly not even a chasid) So, what could have been an interesting essay about the ""meeting of cultures"" is instead a hatchet job. And once again, Jews are 'the other' . We already know too well where that leads."
4,Reads Like A Novel - engaging and informative,"This book was about the culture clash in the small town of Postville, IA (population 1500) between the white, Christian locals and the Hasidic Jews who moved in the late 80s and turned an old slaughterhouse into a kosher slaughterhouse. The author is a Reform Jew so he brought an interesting perspective to the conflict as someone sort of in the middle of the two extremes living in Postville.I really liked this book, it reads like a novel. The only thing that bothered me was the author throwing in Yiddish or Hebrew words without telling me what they meant. The plant in Postville was raided in May 2008 and almost 400 undocumented immigrants, mostly from Somalia and Latin America were removed and the NYT reported that the plant is defaulting on a $35M loan. A sequel may be in order."
4,Documentary that reads like a novel,"As an Iowan, I found the book fascinating, mostly because it parallels the problems that other Iowa towns are having when ""foreigners"" move in. I had heard of the Hasidim, of course, but really knew nothing about them. Their lives, beliefs, and customs make great reading for those of us who have never met them. The criticism that the ""author's voice takes away from the book"" is ridiculous--it's the author's voice that keeps this from being a dull, sociological tome and made me want to read it until it was finished...without stopping."
1,Not Impressed,"It is quite obvious from this book that the author has in mind to bash religous Jews, whom I happen to respect. I beleive he wrote this book as a good excuse and exaggeration to convince the world that Orthodox Jews are bad people. Keep your feelings and oppinions to yourself! Do not write a book showing ""facts"" of the life-style of religous just to bring people to think badly of them. No wonder the author wrote for the LA Times, a known and proven anti-simetic paper!I am not immpressed by someone who wishes to bad-mouth a group of people and putting in a book."
1,A Disgraceful Book,I happen to know Sholom Rubashkin and his family. Sholom and his family happen to be VERY nice people. One of the nicest families I have ever met. They do not think twice to do a favor for someone else. They are always cheerful and bring joy wherever they go.I think it is terrible that somone should waste their hard-earned money to buy a book filled with lies.
2,pornville?,"This book describes the odyssey of a journalist wholly uncomfortable with his Jewish identity. If you appreciate literary works grounded on negativity and inner turmoil, you will feel right at home with this tome. Bloom's personal vendetta with the entire Hasidic community is based on his unfortunate encounters with several severe personalities within the Hasidic community.As a writer intending to pen a work of non-fiction, Bloom selectively chooses his ""information"" according to his convenience. Case in point; while expounding on the virtues of the town of Postville, the author is meticulous in transmitting precise details. However, when discussing the malevolent and baseless myth that Hasid's fornicate through a perforated sheet, Bloom does not bother to discredit this demonizing falsity. No less than on three occasions does Mr. Bloom mention this supposed tradition. And each time he fails in debunking this sexual scuttlebutt."
1,a better choice,"The conflict between religious identity and national identity is an important subject, but Bloom's book doesn't do it justice. Skip this book-- unless you are related to Stephen Bloom and have reason to care about his personal anxieties, you won't learn much. Buy David Kertzer's The Kidnapping of Edgardo Mortara instead-- serious treatment for a serious theme."
4,Great Read,I enjoyed this book very much - actually this is my second purchase - I bought it as a gift.
4,"A good account, but not a great one.","Stephen Bloom writes a somewhat personal account of his experience with the Lubavitcher Chasidim who settled in Postville, Iowa and set up a kosher slaughterhouse there. He attempts to write a balanced account of the encounter that led to a contested vote that led to the town annexing the land under the slaughterhouse.One can argue that it is less than entire unbiased because Bloom is an non-practicing Jew and is not always sympathetic to the Chasidim, although he usually is. Truthfully, the Chasidim came into town unwilling to become familiar with the local culture but at the same time, I'm less than certain that the prejudices of the locals didn't factor in.Overall, it is a good account, but not without small flaws. Probably the best part is that Bloom is fairly honest about his own outlook, so any subjectivity that he may have is out in the open."
2,Overly basic - not really anything new,"It was a very quick, easy read. It contained very basic information- nothing new or exciting; not advanced enough to add much value."
5,"One of the very best family films of the year, maybe the decade.","""Secret of the Cave"" is an outstanding film that takes place in Scotland. It was put together as a college project by Southern Adventist University and the viewer will have no doubt that all those connected have a great career ahead of them. It is not a film that pushes any one faith or doctrine other than how we can relate to each other and to God. Unlike so many films made by beginners, this film is very professional and there is no way any thing connected in its making can be faulted. The extras alone are worth the price. I fully applaud this project and hope the school and the young people involved will continue the good work. We need more Christian film makers like this."
4,Well handled,"Grand Master Raymond Keene handles his subject with fluency and eloquence, as can only be expected of the chess correspondent for The Times and The Spectator. His annotations, as in most of his books, are excellent, and the examples he uses to illustrate his points are always apt, and adroitly used. As part of the series on the World Chess Championships, this book is a necessity for any collector, but more than this, Keene puts emphasis on a player frequently under-represented in the world of chess literature - Wilhelm Steinitz, bohemian, champion and in many ways the father of the world chess champions. Some of the matches here are perhaps not as interesting as others, and may not compare well with those in a few of the other books in the series, but they are handled well, and this more than makes up for the occasional dragging game."
4,A Great WCC Book --But not the best games,"This is a superb example GM Keene's writing brilliance. The analyses are prosy, and don't contain too many moves from random games. Instead, he includes moves from games that feature similar themes or that demonstrate the folly of the text move. I highly recommend this book if you want to collect WCC books or just liked the match.However, if you are looking for a book of great games--don't go here. As a book this is 5 stars. The annotations are masterful, and so his Keene's style. However, as a match, it probably deserves only 2 or 3. Games 1, 13, and 14 are (IMHO) the only good ones. Many were short draws, and in games 5 and 8 Kramnik's huge preparatory blunders hurt the match. Therefore, I recommend Zurich 1953 by David Bronstein if you want great games."
1,Depressing and overtold.,"This book is a depressing tale of a Scandanavian hero. It is no wonder the Scandanavians have the highest suicide rates in the industrialized world. This story goes from one battle to another without breath and there is no epic feeling to it. It seems the Danish King cannot help but offend gods, giants, elves and other mythic creatures at every turn. There are many more enjoyable Viking/Norse tales to be told. Poul Anderson is a mighty writer, and this may be gleaned from many years of painstaking research, but it is a story that did not need to be told."
3,Whose Body,A good enough mystery but then I realized I had just purchased a book that is in public domain. At least it was cheap.
5,Lord Peter,"One of the first books in this series. My copy fell apart last year, so it is nice to be able to read this one. Peter is a nice man. I also like Bunter and Peter's brother-in-law."
1,do NOT buy these,I ordered two sizes larger than I thought I'd need. I wanted them to be REALLY long and I figured that with the drawstring I'd be able to tighten them down to a small. They were perfect UNTIL I washed them. They shrunk 2+ inches in the wash alone. I didn't even dry them. In addition the description says that they are fleece but I don't think that they are. When something is listed as fleece you tend to expect a fuzzy or thicker material and I think these are just cotton pants.
2,These are NOT fleecy,"The pants felt more like rough, cheap cotton or canvas! They also shrunk a ton in the wash (I usually wear a small and the medium was too short after washing). I donated these immediately."
2,Raw Pants,"These sweats were comfortable at first for the beginning of my pregnancy,but now they over stretch after one use they fall of me. Have to constantly wash to rewear them."
4,Interesting and Different,"Interesting to hear how an over the road trucker lives out there in the world that is different from day to day. I often wondered what it was like, and now I have seen it through a real truckers eyes. I enjoyed it alot, it was serious, sad, funny, adventurous and sexual. I would recomend it to all."
5,compilation of high quality trance produced in 1992-1993,"I bought this compilation of tracks from 1992 and 1993 to get the monumental theme 'Acid Eiffel' on CD, and was surprised to find that every track on the disc exceeded my expectations and was at nearly the same high level of quality. It was well worth the investment.The style is analog trance and acidic trance techno with occasional IDM and Detroit affectations, more interesting than his later works. Some tracks sound more dated than others, but regardless, fans of warm analog techno with rich production values will dig it. Many of today's trance producers could learn a lot from it.The original version was released on the ZYX label and had 2 CDs, while this US edition has only one CD. The tracks that are missing are remixes and coproductions with other artists (Reese Project, Vernon S Wonderland, System 7, Alaska, Moby, and System 01)."
2,Disappointed,"As a person with an avid interest in America's colonial period, I was delighted to find ""Sing We All Merrily"". I was eager to buy the CD, especially after reading the previous (Nov.17) review. However, I should have read the song title list more carefully for I would have realized that at least one of the songs is not from America's colonial period (Stille Nacht/Silent Night). My biggest disappointment came as I listened to the CD. I would have preferred several of the songs to be sung entirely by a male or not sung at all - just instrumental. In my opinion, Linda Russell's voice is too high and sharp for some of the songs."
1,Don't Waste Your Time With the Kindle Edition,"This download has the names of the poems, but that's all. No poems! At least I didn't have to ask for a refund."
4,Outstanding Piedmont Blues!!!,"The acoustic Blues that spontaneously arose around the the turn of the century in rural America was an mixture of various influences. Folk, Country, Blues and various forms of ethnic musics blended in and out of each other weaving a beautiful tapestry of sound.Cephas and Wiggins are an acoustic duo who are doing an amazing job of keeping traditional music alive. John Cephas does a great job of guitar playing and singing. Phil Wiggins sounds like he studied at the footsteps of the masters, providing perfect balance to Cephas' singing. Together the two blend effortlessly and any acoustic Blues enthusiast would be happy to have this cCD in their collection.This CD contains eight songs, mostly standards. The originals sound like they were written during the 1920's, the covers are faithfully reproduced. I hope we hear a lot more from these two in the future."
4,Trouble is,"its missing half dozen songs incl my favorite-her live rendition of MARAKESH NIGHT MARKETIVe written several times begging her to remaster and release the COMPLETE concert on CD and/or DVDso far just this distilled repackaged samplerI have the 11 song PROMO for radio stations-has all 11 songs on it from 1996*****You can also buy this new, direct from Loreenas Official site for $10"
2,"Strange brew,doesn't mix","Bob Dylan seems to be one of those artists who are like a mirror. You see what reflection you wish to portray. Having read Jonathon Cotts Dylan,where Dylan is a great poet,Stephen Pickerings Dylan, where he is a wandering Hebrew prophet,I decided on this book. Well, the theology here is an odd mix of fundementalism and Hebrew-christian potpurri. Hey, you can take Dylan songs to justify union busting{union sundown],though I hardly think that is the intention. Ignoring the vast corpus of Dyans work to justify this is simply cheap.Dr. Fruchtenbaum may or may not be a good theologian. Howwever, this book is about HIM, not bob dylan. I was very,very disappointed at the questioanble theological viewpoint and the tedious pedantic postruing and lecturing. Thomas Merton near the end of his life was preparing a study of Bob Dylan. Now THAT would have been interesting and fruitful. This is not."
5,"comprehensive, well organized, complete, a must have","Every technical library should include this easy to understand volume explaining all aspects of cable television. The authors have drawn from their years of education and practical experience in the Cable industry to produce an excellent reference guide for anyone interested in television and cable technology. Included are chapters on Analog TV, Digital Compression, Cable Data Transport,Headend Signal Processing, Coax, Fiber, Consumer Interface and Equipment Compatability, and other topics. Great minds have produced a fine book!"
4,A Solid Foundation of Cable Technology,"This book lays out a great foundation of the technologies you will find in a cable system, and in many cases the content of the book delves much deeper then the basics. I used this book as the primary resource when studying for both of my SCTE certifications the BTS and the BTCS, this book covered about 80% of the exam topics.The biggest (and basically only) downside to this book is its extremely limited coverage of IP technology. Granted there are other resources out there that one can use to supplement this body of work, but given the importance that IP plays in telecommunications networks I would like to see covered in more detail (though I don't know if the book were any bigger that it could be bound.)Overall this is a great, comprehensive book, and worth having it on your desk."
2,it is hard to adjust,I purchased this goggles for my 5 years old son. He found them not comfortable. The rubber around the eyes is not wide enough and it is almost impossible to adjust it.
4,Swim goggles,"I like these goggles. From the photo it shows the adjuster button on the back. The ones we received did not have that adjuster button, only the traditional strap adjustment. The button is so much easier to use and that is why I purchased. Would have been a 5 if they came as shown."
2,Disappointing,"I ordered these for myslef, because adult size is too big. The eye pieces on these fit ok, but the straps have barely enough play. Also they fog up miserably, from the very first use. I did like that they csame in clear however. And the price is good."
5,My son loves these googles,Fits my 3yrs old sons eyes perfect and they work great. I have bought other kids googles before and water leaked in them. These don't. Very very appreciate the maker of these googles. Reccomend these for any kid.
2,A Lost Chance to Entertain and Educate,"I'm a writer (""Pigs,A Trial Lawyer's Story""; ISBN 097200503X) and the owner of a small press. I'm always intrigued by other regional writers. Though the jacket of this book is replete with accolades (one from Larry McMurtry) trumpeting the writing and plot of this novel, I am sorry to say that the reviewer of the Library Journal (see above reviews) got it right. There are bits and pieces of acceptable writing throughout this book but the plot is confusing and the dialogue alters between period and contemporary. This unfortunate editing lapse leaves the writing with an uneven feel. The references contained on the book's jacket praising the novel's renditions of Native spirituality remain just that: unexplored references. Readers looking for a mystery imbedded with Native spirituality should read Tony Hillerman."
2,Disappointing,"I bought these based on the other review's recommendation, but now that I have worn them, I can't see anything special about them. The shoe itself is rather shapeless, and it is a little small in the toe area, but otherwise I would say they are true to size. The bottom also has no traction, so I felt like I was going to slip. There was more padding in these shoes than the Jessica Simpson Leve flat, but it was very thin and flat - if you need arch support, these are not for you. For the amount these shoes cost, I am kind of surprised at how little these shoes offer. It was like walking around in socks."
5,Good book!,"The book arrived very quickly after I ordered it. It's used - very clean, no crumpled pages, no kitchen stains. I'm happy with the quick service, high quality, & less expense. I'm cooking my way through the recipes, happily."
2,"good for the beginner, poor for the intermediate","I'm Italian, and I love to cook Italian food. In fact, we don't like to go to Italian chain restaurants anymore because we can make it much better (and cheaper) at home. I'll admit, I'm an Italian cooking snob [kinda]. Based on this, I have multiple cookbooks dealing only with pasta. And when I saw this at a yard sale, I figured it was worth a shot.That said, when I'm making pasta, this is probably the last cookbook I reach for. It has more recipes in it than my other resources do, but I think I've only used a recipe from it once. It would be good for the beginner. But if you have the skill, for instance, to start with garden tomatoes and finish with your own sauce, you should try some of the classier (and less dated) books out there."
4,Good product,Very nice remote. The panic button option is really surprising when you push it not on purpose ;-) The only bad thing is that the remote doesn't work when plugged on the ignition.
2,The editor should be spanked..,"for allowing this book to go to print with such a goofy plot! Ms. Cullman begins with a tender, touching story of two likeable interesting people, carries the tale almost to the end, and then inserts a grating, stupid episode with witchcraft and magic that completely destroys the mood and the tempo. This element of fantasy is completely out of character for the story, badly written, and totally annoying. Anne McCaffrey she is not! The final few pages get back to the tone characterizing the first portion of the book, but my goodness, it's as if two authors,one of whom is an inept clown, wrote this book...."
1,DISAPPOINTED,"I was very excited to learn that Lauren Bacall was releasing a new memoir to compliment her early biography BY MYSELF, a book which I immersed myself thoroughly so many years ago. For some reason I was under the impression that this would be a complete new book. Instead, the first 426 pages is again BY MYSELF and the remaining pages (80 pages total)are new material. I felt cheated. The 80 pages are hardly exciting and I did not care to read about her political viewpoint about the current administration. All in all, what a waste of money."
1,"Same Book, but worse","I'm not usually tempted to write a review, no less a bad one. But this book is a total waste of time and money. The original book was quite good. She should have left it at that."
2,Bacall Autobiography,"The title is misleading because the author spends an inordinate amount of time detailing her many friends around the world and how many lunches, dinners, vacations, etc., she has with them. There is a lot of name dropping going on here and not a lot of introspection. Who is she trying to impress? And, more important, why? Her acting ability speaks for itself. It seems to me she doesn't need to catalogue her social relationships."
5,Truly a Regular Joe as Bogie stated!,I love the way she writes. She has the ability to write detailed but without fluff. Miss Bacall truly transports one back in time to a wonderful age in Hollywood. Not afraid to voice her opinions and be honest. BRAVA! No backstabbing or gossip. Lovely woman. In brief a book about a classy Lady. More bio's and auto bio's should be out there such as the style with which she wrote hers.
4,Slow Start but a Great Read,"I put this book down after the first 20 pages and left it sitting for months. The book just didn't grab me at all. I picked it up again recently and couldn't put it down. Once the book starts rolling, and Bacall finds her rythm, it is great. The pages on her romance with Bogart and his subsequent illness and death will make you weep. She has a few brief sections where she discusses her politics. Those only take up a few paragraphs and can be easily skipped without missing relevant or interesting content. This is a great read and well worth owning and passing along to friends."
3,FIRST THREE DISKS ARE GOOD,"CD: the first three disks are about her life getting into the business and her life with Bogart. The parts about cancer treatments in the 50's were interesting. She was very naive.She wrote this when she was in her late forties and divorcing Jason Robards.Then Lauren lived another 25 years and wrote the second part. The next three disks were done after 2003. Even her voice has changed. She goes through the deaths of her good friends, some you know, some you won't. Rodney McDowell, Sir John Gilgood (who was gay),Gregory Peck, Sir Alec Guinness (Obi One Kenobi) and others. The rest is her complaining about missing the good old day.She is still alive. I didn't realize that and decided not to look till I was done listening to it."
1,"Same book, with brief epilogue","BY MYSELF--excellent, heartfelt autobiography.UPDATE--reads something like this. ""The next one to die was Adios Hartley. We had enjoyed many wonderful luncheons together over the years and he was my escort to the Golden Globes in 1987. I will miss him terribly.""""Then the next one to die was Beau Bye. He was a delightful person that I got to know well on the set of Uptown Downtown. Such a raconteur!""and on, and on, and on....Reads almost like a Roll of the Dead Christmas Letter."
5,Story of a family's battle with HIV and AIDS,"Very well written account of the Allen family's courageous battle against AIDS, told by Dr. Jimmy Allen, the former head of the Southern Baptist Convention."
2,ex-submarine warfare instructor,"This is good Sci-Fi work backed by a very impressive imagination and solid writing. However, there is just too much coincidence with the luck of the wild Admiral and his friends and too much mass warfare going on to keep a story lined focused. I was much more impressed with Phoenix Sub Zero."
4,"Very good, imaginative submarine technothriller","This is the best DiMercurio novel. The technical aspects are as well covered as in the previous books. What's even better for those readers who have been around nuclear boats is the time jump to a period when 688(I)and even Seawolf class are seriously outdated. Good also are the 21st century twists: new USNavy commands, robot subs etc. The author could however do even better by designing slightly more sophisticated plots (US v. Japan is a bit Clancy-sounding), avoiding a few exagerations (entire carrier battle groups being sunk by a handful of subs) and going for more plausible characters and dialogues: I don't think a senior naval officer would survive, career-wise, publicly slapping down the Chief of Naval Operations. If those points are addressed, then the next book will be a real hit"
2,"Good Story Idea, bad storyteller","If you like techno-thriller military stories, then this book would get you interested. Unfortunately after reading the last page, you feel like you wasted your time. Definately no Payne Harrison or Tom Clancy."
4,In Fairness to Mr. Hicks!!,"I read the other reviews for this book. I am right now browsing through this book and I can't understand how the other reviewers can't find anything valuable in this book that they can use, when I find so many useful information almost every page I look. As for advertising his other books, I only see it mentioned at the end of the book which is quite standard for most authors to do. Perhaps, his mentioning the term ""BWB"" is what they mean by advertisement, which is a shortcut for ""beginning wealth builder"". Perhaps this book is not for the more advanced investors, but if you do not own property right now and would like to, then you are a beginning wealth builder. Maybe most of his ideas seem like ""pie in the sky"" like buying real estate for ""zero"" cash, but I think most everything that happens in our lives is a matter of ""belief."" If you believe, as I'm sure Mr. Hicks do and did when implementing his RE strategies, then there is no doubt that you will achieve it."
2,Good start,"It seems that all books of this nature lack just enough information to be useful,and this book is no exception. Good book for the beginer but leaves you wanting more."
3,Ideas to get you motivated to do something,"I would say that this book has some ideas at the end of the book that are definitely some thoughts on. He has a suggested timetable for you to get started, and he also provides some interesting charts that can get the novice investor going in the right direction."
2,Could have been better,"This was the second Tyler Hicks book that I have read. In this book as well as the other I found that he spends a little too much time marketing his other services and merchandise. I would say that this book is good for motivating newbie real estate investors, but it lacks vital details on controlling income producing real estate."
3,How to Make BIG MONEY in Real Estate,"`How to Make BIG MONEY in Real Estate' packed with ready-to-use strategies, step-by-step techniques, checklists, tables, and charts, as well as case studies. But the book is also too much infomercial.Real estate is a borrowing money business. In the book Mr. Hicks is teaching how to borrow BIG MONEY and keep alive. And he promises - you'll become a millionaire just in two or three years.The book is addressed to a usual reader of the Tyler Hicks works - to the BWB, so called `beginning wealth builder'. As I imagine, the BWB is absolutely naive, unsophisticated and overoptimistic.The book is not so nudnik as some other books by Mr. Hicks. With a keen eye on current regulations and trends (in the US, it is clear), Ty Hicks `reveals his surefire secrets for building real estate riches in the 21st century'. Do you wanna proof it?"
1,The worst I've seen,"This book is horrid, I am an investor in real estate and I thought this book was an ...infomercial. BAD,BAD and more bad, need I say more. I will, it's my right to say more since I had to pay to read this... All this guy wants to do is sell you his memberships for him to scam you, this is the topic of the entire book. All of you newbies out there looking to invest in real state...DO IT! Real estate is great, but this book is THE WORST."
4,Inspirational,I found it refreshing that Mr. Hicks gave suggestions for how to enter the real estate business WITHOUT obtaining a real estate license. Sure I agree with the other reviewers the book wasn't a highly technical book but that is also why I enjoyed it. I didn't buy the book I checked it out from the library and I'm glad I did. I recommend anyone interested in entering the real estate business read all you can before you leap. Sure the claims of making millions may be a bit far fetched for the average novice in real estate but it is a great book for firing up your creative juices.
1,one page worth of material spread out over a whole book,"Honestly I couldn't make it through this book. There were about four pieces of advice in this book spread throughout everything which was filler that was repeated over and over and over again. here's everything:-You can make big money in real estate and give up your 9-5 job-You can invest in real estate with no money downThink of every possible way you could make these two statements, including just repeating verbatim several times, and you could write this book yourself.."
1,Reads Like an Infomercial,"I was dissapointed with this book. It has some fairly good information about real estate. However, the presentation is too flashy, and the book reads like an infomercial. Every other page, the author reminds of his vast experience in Real Estate. The testimonials from previous readers and/or clients sounded very insincere."
5,A wealth of information,"For those people who can't find the value in what's in this book make me wonder if they actually read it.The edition I have was (c) 1999 and it shows in some of the references on how to use computers, but the book is FULL of hints, advice, and forms to help you evaluate your real estate prospects.It's also provides a good pep talk as to not get discouraged in the ""naysayers"" and doomers and gloomers when there are so-called ""bad"" times to buy real estate.Buy this book if you're serious about investing in real estate."
5,Finally! A fitness book that makes sense,"Everything I've learned from this book, I put into action on a daily basis. Not only has Jorgen created a specific workout routine in his book for ME and YOU... he has laid out the proper nutrition plan as well. This book will change your life, if you are passionately seeking change. I've never felt as good as I have in these last 5 weeks as I do now.I've gotten more out of this book than I've gotten from training with a world class bodybuilder with one of the most sought after titles under his belt.Never have I read a fitness book that makes as much sense as this. Best investment I've made in a while."
3,general information on bodybuilding,Not much about diet and training programs. This book contains only the general information about body building. That can be found better in a bodybuilding magazine. But i like one of his training routines. Nothing really special about hollywood secrets or routines. Large number of pages contains demonstration of excersices and recipeis. Won't recommend.
4,Good Soundtrack,"This is a good soundtrack. Most of the songs rock and my personal favorite is CKY - Flesh Into Gear. Some other artists on this soundtrack include Slayer, Sahara Hotnights, The Rezillos, Smutpeddlers, Ramones and more. This soundtrack features most of the music featured in the Jackass movie. And another plus about this soundtrack is that it comes with a bonus DVD with music videos (including an all new Partyboy video), trailers, tv spots and swag. If you liked the music in the movie, then get it."
3,"Hi, my name is Johnny Knoxville and this is. . .",". . . a decent album. Who knew the theme song actually had lyrics? It is a fun album to listen to. It is short, and there are no songs that really drag. It is all quick and up tempo. However the highlight is the ""hidden track."" I won't tell you what it is, but it had me laughing out loud (espacially if you have seen the videos that are part of the DVD this soundtrack comes with). Plus who can resist an album that includes ""Baby Got Back?"""
4,Masters of the Universe,A decent single from Juno Reactor. You get the radio edit for Masters and then 4 remixes of it. None of them really stand out to me and all 4 will probably appeal to dance floors. You'll probably only want this single if you're a die hard Juno Reactor fan... It does have a really cool cover though!
1,Only ONE STRIP comes in the box,Only one 1/8 x 1/8 strip comes in the box. even though the description seems to indicate otherwise. You can purchase a single strip of balsa wood in any hobby shop for less than .50CDO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!
5,Fixed Santa's Best prelit tree burnt out bulbs!!,"If you have a Santa's Best prelit tree, like I did,(I purchased from Garden Ridge) and want to be able to replace burnt out bulbs without purchasing a generic kind 5 at a time and only getting the actual light bulb and having to thread that into each socket on your tree, THIS IS YOUR SOLUTION. These GE made, Santa's Best brand bulbs in this strand of 50 lights fit the sockets on my prelit tree perfectly. Finally found one that did, as the prelit trees socket shape is unique.. that's frustrating... so glad I found these. I was able to get my tree back to 100% working, and have extra replacement bulbs for later."
4,"""...Spiritually inspiring...definitely an eye opening read.""","""Thank God For 2nd Chances is spiritually inspiring. A wonderful story about finding true love and living your life for God.""""Jacqueline Carrington is a beautiful wealthy woman who has the finest luxuries in life. She's engaged to Anton, a handsome business tycoon who simply adores her beyond comparison.""""Jacqueline's ex-fiancee Edmond Gray comes back into her life unexpectedly. Their relationship ended several years ago when Jacqueline received some heartbreaking news on the eve of her wedding. Now, Edmond wants Jacqueline back but she must convince him that their relationship is over before her engagement to Anton is ruined.""""After Jacqueline reestablished her commitment to Anton she decides to reconfirm her relationship with God, and sets out to spread God's word at every opportunity.""""Important issues like, trust, respect, and fidelity are brought to light in this great novel. This is definitely an eye-opening read."""
3,Learning Session,A lot of interesting twists and knowledge of history in the making. The story is that of a tool used by law enforecementthat improves investigations.
1,Does not fit Ducane affinity 3100 natural gas grill,"This does not fit the Ducane 31732101 Affinity 3100 Natural Gas Grill we bought on amazon, although according to the internet this is the part for our grill. When it arrived, the pans were shipped in a usps envelope, so they were smashed and twisted a bit."
2,Not worth it,Other than the fact the female lead in this strange movie is semi hot...Don't waste your time. I wasted 77 minute of my life watching this not to mention $2.99.
1,Lacks direction....,"The film is considerably shorter than most in this genre and doesn't seem to have a third act. Which caused me to wonder if the film company ran out of money before it could be completed.At any rate, it lacked direction and the minimal plot ran into a wall."
1,Worst movie I've seen in years...,maybe decades. I didn't know it was possible for a movie to be THIS bad.
1,Just awful,"You can't always go by those little critic quotes on the box, which is definitely the case here. Do yourself a favor and skip this one (not worth your time and dollars)."
2,STUPID MOVIE,NOT MUCH GOOD TO SAY... ANOTHER CASE OF THE DVD CASE ILLUSTRATIONS ARE BETTER THAN THE MOVIE.
3,Has the purpose already passed us by?,"I came across this book at a cross country ski resort in Northern Vermont with pure white snow and starkly blue skies. The setting could not have been more in juxtaposition to the setting of this novel. In between ski runs, I finished the book in a day and 1/2. I found the ideas fascinating.With Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy coming to the movies, one does begin again to wonder who is serving whose purpose. In this story, people are heading down the same path, using the same information for extremely different reasons. Greed seems to be the one that wins out in the end but there always are a few survivors, at least that is how I chose to extrapolate from the open ended conclusion of the book.Interesting book to read by the fire and think about on the ski trails."
2,not what you expect.,"only gives a very general overview of the book and the sections. this does not give a summery on a chapter by chapter basis. By not being broken down by chapter one cannot use this to determine which chapters to focus your readings on in the actual text. this study guide spends more time explaining itself as source and giving information relating to the book such as historical context, author information,further topics of study, ect. rather than the actual content of the book that it is said to be explaining. If you need an aid to help you focus your reading of the actual book.. look elsewhere... if you want a general overview and information related to, but not specific to this particular book, then this is for you."
4,A wonderful collection of songs and lullabies for everyone,Mike and Carleen McCornack demonstrate an excellent skill in blending wonderful harmonies along with great songwriting. Together they have created a joyful collection for both young and old alike. This recording is a special treat for those that enjoy folk music combined with smart songs for children.
1,Disappointed,"Unfortunately I was not able to watch DVD. It would not play on my ""regular"" dvd player or my Blue Ray player. (yes, I have both) I was looking forward to watching it as Robby Benson as always beem my heart throb!"
3,Grill Basket's spaces too large,"I tried to grill zucchini, yellow squash, peppers and sliced eggplant. As I turned the basket over, the vegetables spilled out. If you are going to use this product, you will need large slices, yet they cannot be too thick for the dimensions of the grill basket."
1,Garbage,"Not worth the money. Find a metal coat hanger, break off the hook and twist it accordingly, much better than this product."
3,Helpful and Informative,"This volume of essays is helpful and informative for all those trying to understand the theology and practice of infant baptism from a covenantal/Reformed perspective. Overall, it is clearly written and positively presented (i.e., not polemical) and written for a popular audience. Most of the essays are good, a few are outstanding (Neil, Pratt, Venema, Strawbrige), a few are weak (they shall remain nameless!) and a few seem slightly off-topic (Doriani, Sproul). I profited from reading this volume, though I cannot say it the last word on the subject (if such a thing is possible). If you want a more scholarly treatment, see Murray's Baptism (although it is dated). We still await a scholarly, up-to-date apology for infant baptism from a Reformed perspective. For the ""professor's-only baptism view"" (they are not necessarily true believers just because they claim to be!!!), you may want to read Malone and Jewett."
2,Badly written,"The story could have been interesting, had it been written in a less childish manner. The characters have no life and the dialogues are just ridiculous."
1,This cannot be Agatha Christie,"The plot continues in a trite, rather childlike manner. The vocabulary and conversations are almost silly. I kept feeling embarrassed for Ms Christie. The book is simply not up to par."
3,"Entertaining enough, but not Dame Agatha's best effort","I thought this Agatha Christie book was a bit sub-par. I was pretty sure of the direction the investigation was going to take and of ""whodunnit"" quite a while before it was revealed (which wasn't the case with the other two Christie mysteries I have read). The setup was a lot like the setup to the movie ""Hot Fuzz"" which kind of made me chuckle, but, sadly enough, I though that stupid comedy movie had a much more clever ending than this novel. Ultimately, entertaining enough, but certainly not Dame Agatha's best effort."
4,Murder IS Easy!,"Have you ever been murdered? Of course not, but in Murder is Easy, a classic mystery by Agatha Christie, you'll be sucked into the job of solving a murder case. Agatha Christie fills Murder is Easy with misleading clues and suspicious characters. If you've never read an Agatha Christie book, this should definately be your first.As a mystery lover, I was shocked at this novel when it went far beyond my expectations. Christie uses vivid adjectives and twist the plot incredibly. A downside to the book was its vocabulary. At times the words were very confusing. For example, on page 244 Luke comments, ""I decided to accept Mrs. Waynflete's invitation to abide in her house, and I resolved to try to ferret the truth out of her. All in all, I would rate the book four stars and would highly recommend it to any Agatha Christie lover."
2,Not up to the mark,"This is easily one of Agatha Chritie's worst books. The plot and mystery are almost amateurish, especially compared to her usual masterful work. The characters aren't very engaging, and there are no entertaining subplots to keep you going. This one is definitely not a keeper."
2,For those who like to be talked down to,"This book does an OK job of explaining basic physiological concepts. I say OK for two reasons:1. The author talks to you as though you are a five year-old. Although maybe a cute literary tool at first, this quickly becomes irritating and eventually makes you want to throw the book in disgust.2. Only a surface level discussion is presented, with very important concepts merely alluded to as opposed to going into sufficient detail. The two most glaring examples for me are the poor discussion of action potentials, and the non-existent discussion of G-protein linked receptors, and subsequent second messengers. In fact, the final exam at the end of the book mentions second messengers as an answer option, despite never being mentioned prior. I guess the author initially included such things, but threw them out to fit in more obnoxious baby talk.There is no reason for this book unless you want a quick refresher on basic concepts. Serious students beware."
2,Underestimates reader,"I am a science student and a big fan of the demystified books. I was very disappointed with this book. The other demystified books explained basic concepts, then built on that knowledge progressively. This book lacks fluidity and consistency. I really didn't appreciate how every word was given a pronunciation. The authors of this book have obviously underestimated the intellect of the audience reading this book. So, if you are more concerned with how to pronounce ""electrolytes"", instead of understanding them, this book is for you."
1,Physiology Demystified,"I ordered this book on Feb 3, 2009. Up to March 7, I have not received this book. I believe your order or shipping system need improve."
3,Get Eyewitness' Guide to Ireland instead,"I bought this book in order to plan a trip to Ireland. I also purchased Ireland by Eyewitness. My advice, unless you are only going to Dublin, buy the Ireland book instead. The Dublin books contents are reproduced verbatim in the Ireland book, plus you get info on the rest of the country as well. Don't get me wrong--it's a good travel guide, but you get more for your money with the Ireland guide."
5,Needs some updating but still well worth it,If you are planning a short trip to Dublin this is a must have book. It covers excellent restaurants and wonderful places to stop and shop. The essential sights are all listed by region and are explained in enough detail for one to decide if they want to visit. If you are going for a longer period of time I would recommend a bigger guide but I would still get this one to walk around with.
2,I hate Eyewitness Travel Guides,"Although Eyewitness Travel Guides may offer more visual guidance than other guide books, they are still quite terrible. Maps are difficult to read and information is inconsistent."
3,"Awesome book, but not new...","The book is awesome and my son is already working away at it and it just arrived...I am sad that the first two pages were written in, so it wasn't new."
4,Great for long summer breaks,I bought this book for a student I work with that is austistic. He does well in school as long as he continues to be learning during the long summer break. If is just perfect to keep children from falling back on what was learned during the school year. I strongly recommend this book to any parent that is concerned about their childs progress (and not just children with disabilities).
5,Great Workbook,"This was a great workbook for my 2nd grader during his summer break. I recommend it highly to anyone wanting to keep their child's reading, writing, and math skills fresh in their minds."
5,Detailed graphics and descriptions of the human body,"This is a good book to have on hand when communicating with adults or children about the body. The graphics are clear and simple; however, detailed."
1,Don't spend your money with this !!!,"Hello, I bought this video. I wait a lot to get it and at the end was just a really old (more than 25 years) Home made video with 24 minutes video and with a really bad quality, I lost time, money and my patience.Sorry"
5,GREAT ADDITION TO A GREAT SERIES,"Like all the books in this particular series for young people, you get much more that just a simple story about an individual. With this one the young reader is exposed to much more than the simple story we learned fifty years ago, most of it not true, and is given a very good insight to just how it was at that time in our nations history. This work is very well researched, very well written and the illustrations fit the text quite well. As another reviewer has pointed out, in addition to learning the life of a very important individual, the young reader is taught how to study history, what source documents are and what is important and what is not. I cannot recommend this one high enough."
1,Pure Fluff,"This is one of the most bewildering stories I've ever read. There is virtually no plot; the build-up of suspense over the ""treacherous"" Mrs. Dorval amounts to nothing more than rumour and gossip. Absolutely nothing happens! The book ends so abruptly that I thought someone had torn out the final chapters."
5,5,"Im from easter island and i really love this CD but it would be great if you guys put it back in stock, because its kind of hard for me to find it,the first time i heard this CD i just went nuts, its just GREATT. MAURURU(thanhs in some of the polynesian islands)."
5,Rich,"Fenua is my favorite album...especially track 3 ""Mama Rava"" Fenua puts me in the best mood...when I'm sick and fed up and have had it up to here with America I pop in Fenua and I think of home and ponder why I ever left...This is the first CD ever that I have completely felt through out my whole body...it gave me chills..."
3,"This is a cd, not a book. It has a key Buddy Holly interview","This has the interview that DJ Red Robinson did with Buddy Holly in 1957 in Vancouver, Canada. It is a voice interview and not a book. It is one of the rare interviews with Buddy Holly that has been preserved for posterity. The other recordings are of other singers singing Buddy Holly songs. For me, the interview is the highlight of this CD, giving me the opportunity to hear Buddy Holly discussing rock n roll"
5,It's an on-the-edge-of-your-seat Adventure!,"It was a very good book. Josh is a boy going camping and when his parents have an emergency, only Josh and his brother are left (alone) camping in the wilderness and that's when the action comes in!"
3,Needs closure,The Fear Place is not up to Phyllis Naylor's usual standards. The book starts out having a sense of adventure with well drawn characters and a good conflict between the two brothers. The conclusion is rushed and unsatisfying. It seems that Ms. Naylor abruptly ended the novel leaving the reader with no clue as to how the central conflict resolves. There was no foundation for any options for conclusions.
5,"Haunting, gloriously evocative and rich","I had never before heard Allegri's Miserere. My original purpose in selecting this CD had been due to my passion for the Tallis Scholars, and having so enjoyed their interpretation of Tallis' Spem in Alium. But when I heard Miserere for the first time, it brought tears to my eyes, for it is one of the most beautiful choral pieces I have ever heard. One can almost picture in one's eye a Renaissance Pope on his knees before the Cross in the Vatican, such are the images Miserere evokes. Exquisite."
4,Good resource for understanding the writing of Paul,"I've found this to be a good resource for the study of Paul's epistle, especially as it relates to understanding some of the details of the time, culture, and language Paul used in the letter. If it lacked anything, then it's in helping me understand how I can apply the message to my daily life and living out the Scriptures. For that, I would use this with another resource like:Paul's Letter to the Philippians (BibleDude Community Commentary Series)The historical and cultural depth of this commentary is extremely helpful for serious study, and I really appreciate how the author helps us learn how we should apply these perspectives to our understanding of Paul and his message.This one definitely helps me understand some important facts about Philippians!"
2,poor editing,Many misspelled words. Does not seem to have been reviewed after conversion to Kindle format. Very dissapointed with all the errors. Expected better.
5,Truly Incredible.....,I love this CD! Michael is incredibly talented with the gentle voice of an angel. I love the variety on this album and have been playing it continuously for months now.
3,"Interesting on a metaphysical level, but....","When I purchased this book I was not sure what to expect, but in regards of the subject of the book it satisfied me when it comes to the metaphysical, or put in other terms, quantum physics in connection with consciousness. What hits me, as with many other New Age masters books, is the absence of teachings and emphasis on the importance of ego release/death, which is a prerequisite and most important for operating fully on these ""levels"". But off course, if you would like to keep people dependent in an esoteric show you avoid doing that."
4,Setting the record straight,All of the good points about EHYEH have been mentioned by other reviewers. I only want to correct two things said by the reviewer from San Ramon:1. Zalman Schachter-Shalomi is very much alive as of this writing.2. Arthur Green is not on the right wing of anything.
3,Unwordly,"No doubt an honest and deep thinker, Arthur Green's journey seeking a deeper approach to Judaism left me trailing far behind. Too esoteric, too me centered, too Reconstructed for my tastes. Too artificial in linking modern thought, Kabbalah and a practical world view. Kabbalistic thought can be challenging enough... adding an additional vision seemed overactive. But I wish the author well in his exploration toward finding his personal Shangrila. He certainly is commited to it."
4,First Act 8 Piece Drum Set,"Purchased this drum set for my 13 year old son from a Thrift Store for $65.00. All parts where there just needing assembly and tuning. Not bad for the price and the drum heads can be purchased if needed. Good set for a beginner who thinks it is an adult set. Cyballs are crap, but they can be replaced. Over all satisfied with the purchase and quality of the set."
1,This drumset is Worthless and STUPID!,"I have this drumset, and I've are broke 4 skins and had to replace the cymbals. I recommend Pearl or DW. But this drumset is worth $10."
2,Pretty useless for anybody but managers,"I found this book pretty useless. It contains a lot of commonplace hints how to organize your life better but doesn't offer many original ideas on how to implement them and help yourself in achieving results. I guess, most of us usually know WHAT our ""time wasters"" are and would rather need an advice HOW to change situation.The book style if old-fashioned and many illustrations (especially tables) are impossible to read because of the author's scribble. It seems to be written by a manager for other managers ignoring the day-to-day needs and specifics of anybody else. Abundance of slang and ""simple language"" is another feature of this book.I found David Allen's ""Getting things done"" a much more inspiring and useful."
3,Good information but old had,"If you have any time in the business world, and you think this book is a learning lesson for you, then I have no idea how you got this far. Even though this may be old information, this is something that everybusiness major should be handed as a survival guide in the corporate world. Even though it has been updated, it is still a little outdated. I was given this book to read, and was delighted to know that I am already doing several of these time saving tasks. I only wish I was given this when I first entered corporate America.I had to learn from several mistakes while swimming in the river of d' nile (denial). This is a must read for any Corporate, high tech, or customer driven professional"
3,The Time Trap Book,"I think it's written more for the corporate population.Perhaps, those who own/operate a business w/employees may benefit too.However, I am still doing a thorough review since I have a supervisor position."
5,Helpful Ideas for Adults -- not kids,"THE TIME TRAPI would recommend this book to anyone who works for a business company that has even a little management trouble. This book teaches you how to manage your time, avoid time consuming problems, keep organized, and much more. It tells you the top twenty biggest time wasters like drop-in-visitors, pointless meetings, and telephone calls. It teaches you how to solve these and many other problems that may not be as common as the twenty-magor wasters. This book is the newer addition of the best seller The Time Trap that came out in 1972. This one tells you better ways to solve problems and new problems that can be solved. This is the best time management book out still from when it came out in the 90's.I read this book in seventh grade just to read a book and so I would not recommend this book to any of the seventh graders because they would probably think it was lame and pointless."
3,"""Time management is stress management of the highest order.""","This book helped me to have a better awareness of the time concept. This has various benefits on one's life: better balance between work and life, less stress, more productivity, and happiness and sense of control over life,etc.The book emphasizes the importance planning tied to goal-setting, determining the priorities without which we can easily lose the motivation to work ahead. It also identifies 20 biggest time wasters and gives resolutions to avoid/overcome them.Personally, I got the most benefit from the concept of ""Ideal day"" and ""Time Log Analysis"". Comparing my typical day to my ideal day and analyzing my typical day with the precise details in time log have helped me a lot."
4,The Time Trap,I personally didn't read this book but purchased it for my boss. It must have been good because he purchased 2 more copies!
3,"Good, but seems to stress technics for manager or higher","Good book but alot of the technics and examples seems to be for managers or higher. I'm just a regular salary guy that is trying to optimize my time at home and work. I am not a manager that have 10 people under me. So I found it hard to relate sometimes. But it does have some sound general time management advice.This book could probably be titled, ""Time Trap for Managers.""I would recommend ""How to Get Control of Your Time and Your Life"" by Alan Lakein for a starter time management book. And probably all you need too."
3,"So Cute, but not what I expected...","The toe on this boot is VERY narrow, not what I expected it to look like. Plus, the boot is NOT tight around my leg, sort of slouches down slightly. I specifically bought this boot because I thought it WOULDN'T slouch, but maybe I just have skinny legs? I'm not skinny, just about average, so it's a bit puzzling why they aren't more fitted :("
5,Best book on Leonardo Da Vinci,This book is full of illustrations. There are pictures of Leonardos notebooks. You get to see exactly how he drew everything. The author also give great insight to much of Da Vincis life and work.
3,Leonardo,"The book's contents are awesome, the book itself a little too worn, but I was glad to have it, for its immense contents."
4,Beautiful book.....,Wonderful book but I had hoped it had more of the artwork.There were no paintings represented in the book.The text was very interesting to read and will continue to provevaluable to me.
4,Noteworthy notebooks,"If you enjoy researching from old documents, you will enjoy this book. It isn't an easy read, however, if you're looking for just an armchair novel. Leonardo had his opinions on many subjects, and wrote fairly technically. The drawings are wonderful, as you might expect, and the diversity of subjects gives the reader a glimpse into his wide range of interests."
4,Very good book.,"The only thing keeping this book from top grade is that the author didn't help with a deduction of Leonardo's letters where it surely was needed - in the anatomical studies for example.This makes it hard to understand the meaning of the drawings compared with the translated text, because Leonardo's letters(in the drawings) doesn't look like anything from the Roman alphabet. So when the meaning of the letters that appears in the drawings are mentioned in the text, you can't understand what letters goes with what in the drawings, because the text ONLY use the Roman alphabet(and NOT Leonardo's letters as seen in the drawings).In other words, to fully get the whole meaning of Leonardo's writings and drawings you do need a ""Leonardo - Roman alphabet"" dictionary.This is a major set back, and the worst is that the author could have avoided this so easily.Other than that the book is amazing."
4,davini notebooks,"definitly the best book you can find without having to pay 60 dollars for the full out notebooks, it tells you what he says in sidenotes on the page but sometimes can be hard to distinguish which note it is, sometimes the note is on a totally different page, still worth the money though"
5,I read It in less than one day!,"This is the BEST vampire book I have EVER read! It was so good I cold't put it down! I read the whole book in less than a day! I would recomend this book to anyone who likes mysteries, thirllers or books on vampires!!!"
5,this was very good!!,"This book was great, you couldn't tell what was gonna happen next. One minute you thought i was this one guy and the you would change to another person and when you found out at the end you couldn't believe who it was. This book was exciting all the way to the end. I couldn't put this book down!!"
1,"Not worth it, buy another book from Amazon...","The book is simplistic and offers no real educational or spiritual value. You can tell when a book or author is annointed, however in this book there is no such annointing. Buy a book from Amazon, however not from this author as their views are not in line with God's."
3,A lot is missing,"Fenby is excellent in the early life of Chiang and the war years in Chungking--lots of anecdotes and tidbits. However a lot happened after 1950 when he installed himself in Taiwan and proceeded with a land reform that ultimately helped save his regime. He also steadfastly defended the island against communist threat-with US help- which under an alternative regime might not have survived. This post-war period is totally missing from Fenby's account, which does not mention that when he died there was a massive outpouring of sentiment from the people. The irony is that he is more revered today in the China he lost than in the Taiwan he helped save!"
3,Disappointing,"Built up as the first comprehensive English language biography of Chiang in a quarter century, Fenby's book does little to further our collective understanding of this complex and important political and military leader. Fenby's goal seems not to have been to carry out an informative and critical analysis of Chiang's career, but rather to tell Chiang's story as a novelist would. As a result, the book focuses too often on peripheral details and amusing vignettes that ultimately have little to do with the Generalissimo himself. To Fenby's credit, this book is well-researched and very well written. However, for the student looking to gain penetrating insight into Chiang Kai-Shek as a leader, this book will prove to be greatly lacking."
2,"Factual, but uninteresting","This book is thoroughly researched but bone dry. This book is for you if you want a list of facts: this happened, then this happened, then this happened....What this book doesn't do is to make an interesting story out of the history. The book doesn't discuss why certain things happened or the motivations of actors to do what they did. The book doesn't touch upon the consequences of the decisions that were made. In short, this book gives the ""what"" but not the ""why"" or ""how"" that would transform the book from a list of events into a narrative."
4,Incomplete... Book 2?,"Insightful look into the life one of the 20th Century's most fascinating figures, told with a detailed background of a difficult period, blurred by multiple conflicting views of history.However, much is missing from the Nationalist-Communist Civil War, defeat and relocation of government to Taiwan, and ensuing reign. These are requisite chapters in the life of Chiang Kai-Shek, and the narrative should be graded incomplete without."
2,A Poor Attempt By Neal,I am a Neal Hefti admirer but this album just didn't work for me. I believe Neal was trying his best to boost Frances Wayne but he didn't succeed.
4,for the hater in you,"you know why i don't get down with the jungle scene much any more...cuz i swear, more than any other music scene, there are tons of haters...snobs who won't dance they'll just stand there bickering to their friends about how DJ so and so doesn't live up to their standards instead of cutting loose and actually having a good time. that said, i'm sure klute would give a big middle finger to these types. this cd stayed in my cars deck for months and im just getting around to talking about. true there are some tunes which are only alright in my opinion it has a heaping of some of the most epic and catchy and good feeling tunes out there. oh yeah i love minimial techno, house blah blah blah but he should have definetly stayed away from releasing the second cd with the first. besides like one song that cd is dreck and is ignored in my mind. i guess there is a hater in everybody"
2,Don't Buy this cd,"How is it that Klute transitioned from making the most amazingly oppressive Industrial noise to making easy listening Drum 'n' Bass? If you want aggressive dnb buy Friction, Kemal, Dylan, Twisted Individual, Dillinja, Black Sun Empire, Ed Rush, Usual Suspects, Stakka, Trace, Keaton, Hive, or even Dieselboy!"
2,I just saw this today,"Like I mentioned, I just saw this version. I have read the book many times and love the book. First thing, this version does not follow the bood very closely. Too many things were left out. There was not very much emotion portrayed in this version. There was much of it in the book and other versions I have seen. Jane was too pretty in the the movie. I couldn't imagine Jane being that pretty in the book. It tells me in the book that she was plain. Everything was sickly sweet and glossed over."
4,not to bad... if everything fits right,"For a home theater in a box, and so cheep, it sounds good.Not Denon good, but farly warm open sound, desent range -- the manual clames 20 Hz to 20 kHz, if true, that's inpresive for something so cheep. It has very little power however, and that will limit how large a room it will be able to work in, and of corse how loud it will play.It looks very smart too.The picture was also better than expeted, given the price. But the buld felt a bit cheep and the disc tray was missalined and would not open without help, and it would pause randamly (possably because of the missalined disc tray), so it was sent back for a Toshiba.Other then THAT I would recamand it."
1,Disappointment,The only rating option available on the above scale was 1. I would actually give it a -5. The Cast Iron Paper Towel Holder is a poorly made product. It is not square which makes it difficult to put together. And it is not stable. A great disappointment. I would not recommend it to anyone.
5,taste great!,"these little cookies taste fantastic! not too sweet, just right....chocolate melts easily, so we will be ordering these in the cooler months only"
5,Sweet and refreshing,"I love these! After discovering a familial gluten intolerance, premade items that are gluten free have been difficult to obtain. Therefore, I now order these by the case each month. Light, refreshing, sweet and no grainy aftertaste. Yahoo! I don't have to break my dient now and I might not starve to death! I am so weary of lettuce...."
4,yumm,I got these not expecting much but they were realy good. For gluten free they were great. I am so glad i found these. There great for when your craving something sweet.
5,gluten-free and corn-free cookies that truly satisfy,"These are cookies that give a satisfying crunch, taste great, yet still are both gluten-free and corn-free. Finally, something to satisfy my sweet tooth while also providing some of the hard to find gluten-free crunch."
5,delicious,These wafers melt in your month! I buy by the carton. we all love them. Highly recommended.
4,Yummy lemony goodness,"Although at first I wasn't sure about the texture of the wafers, I found these lemony wafers to be really addicting. The lemon filling flavoring is delicious and much better than the chocolate version of the same wafer. i would definitely buy this again!"
5,My kids love them,My two little boys love these. I can't tell them apart from the real gluten version.
4,COOKIES!!!!!!!!!,My hubby and daughter LOVE these cookies. They are kinda spendy though. I did not enjoy them as much as I like gluten containing cookies!!!!
1,tastes like licorice :(,I bought these locally. The price was high and I don't like the licorice taste! I couldn't even finish the box... I prefer the Schar brand vanilla wafers.
4,Too much sugar,"Crispy, light, but overloaded with sugar.Sweeter then any GF product I have tried!!! The price is one the high side, but Amazon has a good deal."
5,As good as regular!,"These wafers are delicious. My daughter has celiac so I buy them for her, but I love them too!"
5,the best,"Best cookie ever - if there are Glutino Lemon Wafers on my kitchen shelf, I can sleep well at night... best dessert .... fabulous fix for the sweet tooth. Top notch cookie that deserves top praise."
5,Fabulous!,"I never thought I'd bother to review a cookie, but . . . These are terrific, indistinguishable from 'real' cookies. We go through a lot of these."
1,Sorry I spent the money,"I miss eating wafer cookies and the picture on the box looked great. So I spent the $5 and took them home. I had high hopes! I took one bite and the cookie tasted very unpleasant. I can only describe it as ""musty"". Kinda tasted like its been sitting in a basement somewhere for months. Stupid me ate another and then felt slightly nauseous. I'll be throwing the rest of the box away."
2,Not a favorite,"Well, my kid who isn't gluten free likes them, and my kid who is won't touch them. I cook and bake most of what we eat, so desserts are very homemade and natural in their flavor. These are really, really artificial-lemon flavored....they remind me of my dish soap every time I try one. I really don't like the flavor, but the texture is nice. I'm a little dizzied that I have so many boxes of something I don't care for... it was worth a try, though."
2,HATE THEM!,"These maybe waterproof, i haven't tested that yet and they do light but they are the biggest pain in t he rear. if you try and strike them, even gently, they usually break in half. It may take a few strikes to light them and then they have so small a match head they they go out very quickly after lighting unless holding them at an extreme downward angle. This was all tested inside with no breeze or harsh conditions. I gave them to my roommates (all campers like me) to try and we all found the same thing: these are some fragile and poor-quality matches. Thank goodness I didnt have to test them out on a camping trip."
1,WORTHLESS!!! - - Buyer Beware!,"READ PREVIOUS REVIEWS!Pros:Uhh,they look like matches?Cons:Box and the Striker on the box is not water proof (cannot light matches if the striker gets even moist)Matches are NOT water proofMatches Snap in half upon attempting to lightSolutions;DONT EXPOSE TO humidity or water (NOT WATER PROOF!)When attempting to light, Hold your fingers at the base of the red phosphorus stuff. ""try not to burn your self. . .""Just Thros these POS away and go buy a box something eles. . . any thing is better then these."
3,It's ok,"The reviews were right about these breaking easily, i can't speak for them being waterproof, they do break easily and burn up the stick before I can light most things. But they work for what I need them for so I'll give them a 3 star review. I light them close to the edge so I don't break them."
3,They're just matches...,"It does everything that it is suppose to. But, the shipping cost more than the product. I think that 1st. class US Mail would have been better."
2,Thumbs down... What an annoying movie...,An experimental movie that can't get its act together. Full of repulsive characters... There are glimpses of good ideas and interesting dialogues here and there but overall one of the most annoying films I have ever seen.
2,Caveat Emptor,I purchased this study guide believing that it would be a REAL student guide that required the student to answer cogent questions (short answer and short essay) at the end of each chapter but this study guide is no more than a glorified version of Cliff Notes. Save money and use a free online study guide.
1,NOT!!! It doesnt smell great at all!,"Please don't waste your time on this product anymore! Everytime I got my hopes up high, the product has too many different horrible scents...used to be the BEST!!!!!"
1,Not The Scent It States It Is,"If this is what new cars smell like, I would not buy one. The scent is not like anything I have come across, the closest way to describe is that it smells like an electrical transformer burned out."
4,You might want this,First off i would like to say i have Xbox 360 and i wanted a fun arcade style boxing game and there is none now a days besides fight night to choose from.Now going back in the year's to older graphics i would have to say they are not that bad this game will play on your 360 but you have to have it online for an update and that only takes a second an then you don't have to be online any more.This rocky is a lot harder than the 2002 one.But i think it is a lot of fun and if you are a rocky fan you must own this.This game is not sim but is a lot of fun especially with 2 player's .I just hope ubisoft make's us another one for the 360 i want a new rocky game damm it! But this one will have to do for now.
4,Rocky Legends Lets you Relive the Rocky Magic!,Length:: 0:54 MinsThis is just a quick review of a game we loved. It is my first video review so be kind. Just kind of testing the waters here!
4,Good Stories with age appropriate life-lessons :),"Good radio program, interesting stories for my 6-8yr old to get into. She sometimes avoids reading and prefers to watch the cartoon version or course, but once she's interested she will read the book too."
1,No Flo n'go,"I purchased a Moeller DuraMax Flo n'go December 5, 2009 as a Christmas gift for my son. We attempted to used it our lake house to gas boats for the first time this past weekend. I assumed a few squeezes on the hand pump would act to prime the gas and it would flow by siphon until the boat tank was filled. After continuosly pumping for ten minutes or longer without any flo n'go, the pump began to leak gas into the water. The only way to empty to DuraMax was continously squeeze the pump or to raise the heavy DuraMax above the tank on the boat. Is this necessary or do we have a faulty pump?"
3,Holds Gas,This is a gas tank. Can't really use it reliably for anything else. Wheels don't work after a while. The tank swells and renders them useless. Pump is a science to try to figure out. It pumps when the tank is well above the dispenser nozzle.
2,Already falling apart,"There is are 2 eyelet valve on both the hose and the container (at thebottom). The small black handle on the valve for the container isbecoming loose and also very hard to move from the close to openposition. It feels like this will break off with additional normal use(open and close) .. I noticed that the valve was hard to move positions,when we first bought it and well as when the container is on its back,with no pressure on the value."
4,duramax 14 gal can,"will save me the cost of the can in savings from the marina pump this year alone. be prepared for the weight if up carry in a pickup and unload at the dock. fairly slow to drain, but not as long as discussed on other reviews. don't like the ""safety"" latch, but i'm sure that wasn't the idea of the company, but can easily be ""removed"". heavier hose would be nice, but just set the tank 4 or 5 feet back to give a straighter length.incredible price compared to Cabelas."
1,Don't buy it.,Not worth the money. Very cheap pump handle and the hose is a very cheap grade of rubber (collapses on itself).
3,Cheap Wheels,"Does not pump, it only work gravity if the tank you fill is lower then the Dura Max. Its way to hard to lift full of fuel. It pumps by hand but you have to constantly squeeze the trigger for a half hour."
2,not happy,"I think its really cheap, I would have put the money towards a more sturdy model. After all is holding gasoline."
2,Need A Pump To Use,"You need to either lift this item, w/14 gallons of gas in it, onto a platform or tailgate as seen in one of the descriptive pictures, to get any gas out of it. I would not buy this rolling gas again unless it came with a hand cranked pump. Ha..that or buy/build a platform to position this item to work using gravity. Would not buy it w/o a decent pump...one that easily attaches to this plastic gas can."
1,"Great Tank, lousy hose and nozzel","Bought the tank and it worked great the first year. This year the hose was so stiff I could hardly get it to work. Then it kinked. Obviously a reaction with the gasoline. Now the nozzel has broken off and so there is no way to pump or use it, unless you are willing to pick up a 14 gallon container (105 pounds) so you can siphon into your tank. And with no nozzel, you better be fast at turning off the valve that is sandwiched so close to the tank you need the fingers of a five year old to reach in to use it.Oh, and when you contact the company their reply was your tank is two years old, so, too bad, and then they also asked me to send them pictures because they didn't believe I had their DuraMax tank.Buyer beware is all I can say, from a disappointed user."
1,Flo n Wait and get gas on hands,"What a piece of ****. I'm still using this stupid thing for the 3rd year now. I will NOT buy another one of the terrible siphon hose thing. What I'm going to do is get a real hose and attach it to it. Not the flimsy thin it comes with. As others have stated, you cannot lock it in place, so you have to hold the handle and wait up to 30 minutes for the stupid thing to empty. It gets worse as the hose gets more kinked. Then, the plastic siphon thing leaks and gets gas in the water (I use for boating) and all over the boat and my hands. I'm writing this review as I wanted to go to the company website to see if they had a better hose for this thing. Nope. Have to buy the cheap siphon and hose for like $50. Don't waste your money. I think getting two 6-gallon cans as someone else suggested is a better idea."
1,don't buy,I have been using Amazon for years and always had great luck until now. This item just doesn't work-no matter what age. I have tried and tried but only get a drop. My handy son in law tried-nothing. My two sons tried-they failed. Amazon should be ashamed to even carry this product. This is nothing but junk!!!!
1,pumps slow,"It holds alot of gas but the pump is crap. it flows ok for a bit but then you nearly have to lift the thing higher to keep it flowing, and it's pretty heavy and defeats the purpose of having the pump...not worth the price."
2,Read the negative reviews!,"As many have mentioned, this thing is poorly engineered. I couldn't get the pump holder handle on as the screw embedded into the body was loose. Took 30 minutes to rectify that problem. And it is cheaply made. Plus, I love Amazon.com but their price is just stupid. Costco had this thing for $90."
1,bad handle,"The first can started leaking from the handle upon first use, Amazon immediately sent a replacement and I didn't use the hand pump feature on the second can, just used gravity feed and that handle began leaking also. The plastic handle is not able to be taken apart so I don't know where the leak was exactly coming from. I bought this to avoid leaking gas onto my snowmobiles, atvs and motorcycle but i'm going back to using the regular cans. The customer service from Amazon was fantastic but Moeller's product needs some help."
1,Piece of garbage. Leaks everywhere.,"This is a big waste of money. This ""nozzle"" is a super cheap pump that leaks all over. We were able to use it as a storage tank by cutting the hose and using gravity to feed the gas into our tanks.Buying three 5-gallon plastic cans AND a good spout is probably what you want. It's definitely what I want!"
1,Save your money,I have owned this product for a month. It is not worth a dime. It is cheaply made. The fuel handle leaks gas. You cannot get the last 2 to 3 gallons out of it.
3,Moeller Dura Max hose poor quality,The hose is not made of the best material and presents issues and kinks up when putting gas in a boat. Even our neighbors wouldn't buy one. We ended up putting a different type hose on the container. Wouldn't buy another one because of the hose.
2,Not what I expected,I should have listen to other reviews. You cant get the last gallon out without spilling it out on your self! Flawed design. They should have thought about that before making the thing....
1,Practically useless,"I used it once. The hoses and dispenser nozzle leak and the wheels are now useless, as they dig into the tank. It's now in a landfill somewhere and I bought a few 5-gallon steel gas containers with safety caps plus a littls hand truck to haul the gas. This thing is unsafe."
2,"Bottom can't be emptied, hose mount break, pump is slow","The bottom cannot be emptied using the bottom valve, only way to somewhat get it emptied is to lift it head down and use the top hole but even doing that leave some in, messy !!!The hose mount screw also broke without much forceI decided to get many 5 gallons tank instead, store them on a shelf in my garage and use gravity to fuel up the cars, MUCH MUCH better !!!"
3,Moeller Rolling Fuel Caddy,"The rolling gas can is well-made, and is useful for filling multiple small and medium sized gasoline powered items. The hose and nozzle assembly flows too slowly to be used to fill larger tanks, unless your boat is a long walk away from your car, when the wheels come in very handy. The hose could be a little more rigid, as it kinks up once in a while. I hoist the tank up a couple of feet to speed up the gravity pouring."
4,Very useful,"This tank has saved me from filling multiple small tanks. It saves time.But this is not for you unless you can keep it higher than what you are filling.You can pump by hand but that is tiring because each squeeze only delivers like a cup of fuel. It works well, though, if the tank is kept high to use gravity feed by keeping it on a truck bed or on a cinder block. Unless you can do that you would be better off buying several tanks instead, in which case No-Spill 1450 5-Gallon Poly Gas Can is a great alternative. I have both. I use the 5-Gallon can more often for smaller things like a trimmer, but the 14-Gallon hand pump is easier to use for a larger equipment like ATV or generator.By the way, my hand pump started to leak badly after a year. I contacted the manufacturer and they sent me a replacement pump which has a better hose on it. It is nice they took care of the problem without any hassle."
3,Duramax 14 Gallon Fuel Caddy,"Bad points, your hand gets tired quickly pumping 100 times to fill a lawn tractor gas tank. To make matters worse, the safety catch requires your other hand in a awkward position to disengage it.Good points, throw away all your old gas containers and never have to lift, pour and spill gas all over the tractor ever again."
1,Disappointment,"We purchased this to fill tractor at farm. On the back of pickup it was higher than tractor and it would not flow. Put two saw horses on back of truck with boards on them. Managed to get tank on them and it finally flowed. We will probably go back to 6 gallon cans. This was a waste of 100.00. I saw one review that told how wonderful it was and ridiculed anyone having problems. My conclusion is he must work for the company .my husband is very good at getting things to work and this is way too much trouble. I would advise anyone not to waste your money. The company should have to post disclaimers for all the ""possible"" problems."
1,Buy three 5 gallon cans and a dolly!,"It's all been said here. It takes FOREVER to empty this thing. Gravity flow is so slow you can't believe it. Your hand will get sore from holding the nozzle open. You can't get the last 2 gallons out of it. It looks the old version had a pressurization device, the one I got does not. I'd like to have my $100 back. I thought this would make filling my boat easier than using 5 gallon jugs. It not easier, it's longer. It takes forever to empty this thing. And in case you didn't catch it, it takes forever to empty this thing."
1,A waste of money!,"Do not waste your money here, this product is total junk and the one I bought is heading to the dump after two years. The list of complaints on this is long: heavy to pick up 14 gallons of gas at once to get it above where you are pumping too, ackward to pick up when full no hand holds on sides, hose is stiff when cold and cracks real easy, you had to hold the nozzle open the whole time you are fueling, the nozzle started leaking and there is no way to repair it and the replacement is almost half the price of a new can. You are better off buying smaller cans that are portable and will last longer than this junk."
1,It's a Leaker,"Bought two of these to use for boats, etc. Both handles leak when using the pump feature. They are okay if you siphon only.d I cut the nozzle off one to prevent leaks. They are a little cheaply made."
1,Very disappointed,Use the product once worked fine. Used it a second time the pump handle leaks severely. As others have stated this product is majorly under engineered and not worth the money.
2,Great idea,"The concept is great. But after the first use the pump leaks, and the flow is minimal at best. The hose is very prone to kinks as well. The 2 valves used to turn the flow off and on are a gigantic pain in the rear. If a better pump came with the tank would be a definate 5 start"
1,JUNK,"I m a CEO of 2 small companies, received a boat as a gift and bought this product as I m in my 60's and thought it would help me get gasoline from the shore out to the dock. Wrong. First, FedEx delivered the product and the box looked like it had gone through a grinder. The ""simple"" instructions are great if you have a degree from MIT in engineering. After lugging this thing to the boat...I spent 1.5 hours trying to get it to pump. It pumps at the speed of ""zero."" I have been in manufacturing 28 years and this is the biggest rip off I have ever seen on a product I ordered. Certainly isn't Amazons fault. Thanks..good luck."
4,WOW,"used it this weekend to refill my generator on 4 occassions and it was great not having to hold the can or having gas splash on me. the hose was long enough to reach from my truck bed to the generator which eliminated any lifting and I had a nice siphon so I didn't have to constantly pump. however, on the down side is the thin hose that kinks easily and that damn button you need to push in as long as you're pumping."
4,I like it,"Bought 2 to bring gas to my boat. The gas fill cap is lower than the dock so gravity does all the work, I do not pump it. Takes about 10 minutes to empty the can and leaves very little in it, maybe 1/4 gallon. I just tip it forward and the rest comes out. I can see if you are trying to pump the gas up against gravity where it could cause a problem."
2,Not Quality,"I ordered this product for my father as a gift. When it was shipped to my house, the box looked like someone had beaten it with a baseball bat. All pieces were included but if there had been any small parts they would have been lost through the many holes. I was embarassed to give this to my dad. Due to the condition of this item I would not order from this seller again."
3,Weak hose hook,The hose hook is very weak and cannot handle the hose and dispensing handle. Fuel comes out slow but I knew that already.
1,STUPID PRODUCT,ITS GRAVITY FEED. THE SHUT OFF VALVES ARE IN A TIGHT SPOT AND IS FRUSTRATING TO TURN THOSE TINY SHUTOFFS. THE HOSE KINKS EASILY. BASICALLY IS A WASTE OF DOLLARS SPENT ON THIS ....14 GALLON PRODUCT. THIS PRODUCT NEEDS TO BE REINVENTED TO MAKE IT BETTER PRODUCT. IM JUST NOT FEELING THIS PRODUCT.
2,Leaks and pump is useless,"The gas tank holds gas, you can roll it around and it doesn't take up much space. All good.The bad is, if you fill it up with 14 gallons of gas, it leaks from the upper fill cap. I put exactly 14 gallons in it, I did not fill it to the very top. After you take some gas out of it 1/4 - 1/2 gallon? it no longer leaks. OK, so no big deal, you put 13.5 gallons in it and problem solved.The bigger problem is with the pump. What a joke. If you are looking to bulk-up your forearms, its great. If you are looking to move gasoline, forget it. It took me over 5 mins to move just two gallons of gas. I will have to buy one of those crank pumps that I believe works with this unit."
4,review duramax flo n go,"seams to work well for me , a little slow , but so what. would be nice if it emptied completly, oh well good overall product"
3,14 gal Transfer Pump and Rolling Gas Can,"The Moeller DuraMax Flo n'go LE Fluid Transfer Pump and 14 gal Rolling gas can is a great addition to my RV and Boat (I bought 2 - one for each thru AMAZON) I like the sturdy construction and the gas dispenser nozzle. The only downside is it is lacking a D cell battery powered pump in the Nozzle Assy so one doesn't have to position the Flo n'go above the fuel tank which makes it difficult to put gas into an auto, rv or boat where the fuel cap is above the height of the Flo n'go. Gravity feed doesn't work in this case.Michael Walsh (Phoenix AZ)"
1,Wrong order,"I ordered the Buff, but mistakenly was given another shade. To ship it back would cost too much to have it replaced. Kept the product and hope to be able to give to someone who may use it."
5,Amazing...thrilling...captivating,"This book is definatly one of the best I have read in a long time. The author had me so caught up in what was going on that I could not put it down during the four days it took me to read it. The beginning and the way Mr. Tabor introduces you to the characters gets you hooked, and the events that the protagonists find themselves in keeps you reading. There is a wonderful twist for an ending that has me finding myself reading the last chapter and epilogue over and over. This is definatly a must-read for anyone who enjoys a good political suspense novel, or anyone who enjoys a great novel. Tabor certainly has recommendations coming from my direction."
2,SENT WRONG POEM,"Frame was sent with wrong poem, not the one shown in photo of product. was very disappointed."
5,Every kid should have this book.,"Forget the economics slant from other reviewers. In my opinion, this is one of the finest children's books ever written. That it features an interesting, intelligent, fun, individuated girl, moves it to the top of must-have reading.And if you can get it in the original hardcover, with that simple and wonderful illustration, all the better. There's no need for any fancy-schmancy. This is also the perfect gift for an eleven-year old, as the heroine is exactly that age."
4,A kid's guide to ecconomics,"Janie and her sister both want new bikes. But they need to pay for 1/2 (one half) of them. So, Janie, (who spends all her money on comics and chewing gum) forms KID POWER, an organazation made up of one and only one member--herself--that does odd jobs for $1 (one dollar) an hour. Includes lots of facts and terms relating to ecconomics and the money program of the United States. (Reccomended, but a little too unreal.)"
5,A Sophisticated and Entetaining Masterpiece,"This collection of essays by philosophers, comic writers, and other brilliant people does not sacrifice intelligence or fun. This is not one of those pop-culture and philosophy/theology books where trite little metaphors from pop-culture are stretched into cliched little feel-good sermons. This is a serious examination of some of the most powerful stories and images in modern America. The essay on ""God the Devil and Matt Murdock"" is especially good. This is a great tool for ministers, philosophers, theologians, and comics fans looking for insights into the characters and stories they love. If the title sounds even slightly interesting to you, pick this book up. If it doesn't, pick it up anyway."
3,Thought provoking but limited,"This book inspired me to ponder several concepts, but the views expressed as the chapter conclusions were often scantily supported. The book delved into some interesting topics such as identity and what it means to be moral, but several chapters were based on only one or two superhero characters or even one specific example from the superhero world. The book veered into religious philosophy more often than was warranted given the subject matter. I'm glad that I read this due to some insights it gave me into a few characters (esp. Batman and Superman), but I was disappointed due to the great potential a book of this nature could have. Superheroes and Philosophy is probably the only book based on the combination of these two loves of mine, so I am glad that I bought it. However, there are deeper volumes of the popular culture and philosophy series."
5,Fantastic!,"This book not only came in as brand new but was wrapped in plastic and came earlier that expected, which definitely helped as giving it as a gift to my significant other."
5,Great basic introduction to the pillars of philosophy,My daughter is taking debate and her teacher is using this book to introduce the basic ideas of utilitarian and deontology. It is simple and direct and takes a fun approach to the subject.
2,Missed The Boat,"This one just didn't do it for me. I have enjoyed 2-3 of the authors and some of Morris' work in the past, but this one fell flat. There is some heavy repetition in my mind amongst the collection of essays, super hero characters are repeatedly analyzed, and frankly I felt in a number of cases this book challenged me to take it seriously. If you are a big comic fan, pass, and if you are a big fan of Tom Morris, pass."
2,Not bad..... 2 1/2 stars.,"One of this band's biggest influences is (guess who) Nightwish-- and it shows. A lot. Namely in the keyboards, which sound almost identical to the ones in Oceanborn. If you are a NW fan at all you'll notice this, and it can either be pleasantly familiar, or plain annoying.This CD's major flaw is that the production is awful. Sometimes you can barely hear the vocals, which are weak-sounding as it is. The songs themselves are good, but the dull quality sort of keeps them from being enjoyable.I'd recommend VoA's next CD, Cast Away, much more than this one. It has a new male singer, better production, and they've gotten rid of their attempts at ""death vocals."" Go ahead and buy Eternal Endless Infinity if you're a fan of the style, but don't expect anything to rival a band like Nightwish."
2,"A good effort, but sounds like a demo","Well like everyone else, I am a Nightwish fan, so when this band was suggested to me, I bought this CD. The first song is okay, but after that, I stop paying attention. The music is good, but not great...maybe it's the production. The vocals are, imo, the best female vocals next to Tarja. I think the comparison to Angels Fall First is a good comparison - this is almost like a demo.All in all, I wouldn't spend money on this CD unless you're a diehard fan of bands that sound like Nightwish, but they have a ton of potential...and I look forward to hearing their future releases as they mature."
2,*sighs*,"I bought this CD because of the pretty cover. Well, I also heard they were a wannabe-Nightwish, and as a huge Nightwish fan, I wanted to see what they sounded like. The vocalists are terrible, and pushed too far back in the mix. The music is actually pretty good, though. The only track I ever listen to is Lovebearing Storm, and I marked it only as 3 stars on my iPod. I would not reccomend this album to anyone, nor will I ever purchase Cast Away. Look people, yes, there is a pretty cover, but save yourself a headache, and don't buy this."
3,Decent release but could be better.,"This bands music should appeal to Nightwish and symp. metal in general.The music it`s self is well writen and interesting.Since Nightwish is my favorite band they would get 5 stars from me but I could only give 3 stars for two reasons.First,the prodution on this CD is mediocor at best which gives a the music a muddy sound.And 2nd,they over used the male vocalist in the most of the songs.The male singer wasn`t very good but the female singer was pretty good but not as good as Tarja of Nightwish.Hopefully if the band continues to use a male and female singers that they will look for a better male singer."
5,Great gas can,Purchased 3 of these gas cans to fill my portable generator. Great size and easy to pour in the generator and to fill my car. The gas poured quickly and had no spill.
1,NOT spill proof,"The child resistant closure is useless when the spout is permanently open, you can't close it. Also this is a bad design...you can't fill the tank up to the top because it will start spilling out as you tilt the container to start pouring out the gas. Wants to return it, but the return postage cost just as much as the item."
5,pacy,"this one book that will keep your mind off a lot of things as you read it,better get a secluded place or be prepared to see a stream of people coming in to check up on you as you laugh your head off because some of the things you will read in the book are so far out you will have to blow your head off."
5,AutoCAD 2007 No Experience Required,"Takes a beginning user from start to 3-D drawing in a clear, easy to understand format. I have several AutoCAD instructional books, none however that come even close to the usefulness of this one."
3,I should have paid more attention,"When I ordered autocad 2007, this book came up as a ""better with"" and I took it. This is a beginners book and not really a reference or problem lookup book. If you are not a beginner get Mastering Autocad or the Autocad Bible."
