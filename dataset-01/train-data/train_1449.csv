2,A First?,"This is an unusual book written for the young reader. It is apparently a book based on a video game which in turn is based on a Tom Clancy character and written by a David Michaels. It carries the name of a popular writer in the title (Tom Clancy). If Clancy had little or no input (one can't tell), then one would wonder if Mr. Clancy has used a ghost writer for his other novels? I wonder how much he would charge other writers to use his name to sell their novels.A young reader who is unfamiliar with old clich√©s of the English language should enjoy it, but serious readers will be put-off by the writing style."
1,So bad I gave it up after 5 pages...,"I'd like to start out by stating I am a hardcore Tom Clancy fan. I've read all of his books many times (in fact I had to buy a 2nd copy of Red Storm Rising) and read the Net Force series. I picked up Splinter Cell looking forward to tales of Sam Fisher but as soon as I started reading I noticed something odd. The author was writing in a first person view like none I've ever seen before. He uses the word I constantly. In one paragraph EVERY sentence started with I. I did this. I did that. It dosen't make for good reading at all. I skimmed ahead and it seemed like the author continued to overly use the letter ""I"" throughout the book so having spent $12 of my hard earned money I put the book down and never expect to pick it up again."
5,Great book,"Great book. I read all of them and didn't read this one till last. That was my biggest mistake. It takes you through the foundations of Splinter Cell and gives you the knowledge for the other books. Having read the others first it was kind of a given as to the plot and what toys he was going to get. All in all a very good book but yet even a better series. I originally started out reading Richard Marcinko's books (Rogue Warrior series) but in his last three to four books he has gotten a lot more touchy feely and not as rigid as he used to be. If you like the Splinter cell series I suggest Marcinko, check those out, real world. Just make sure you start with the first one. Happy reading!!"
3,Splinter Cell,"I was very let down from my expectations. The story in this book is more like a narrative in a kid's video game than a Clancy novel.On the up side there is some good killing going on, that always helps.I would have liked for there to be more detail about what the Russians did with Sarah, mentioning pliers can conjure up images but some graphic descriptions would have been nice.I read the entire book so it is not all that bad, just not what I expected.I would recommend it for people aged 14 & up but the foul language is a negative for the younger readers."
2,Splinter cell,This book was okay. If Tom Clancy had written it the book would have been much better. it would get boring sometimes in the book where i would be tempted to skip parts. this book let me down. if you are a splinter cell fan read this book. personally i dont think its that bad but i just think it could have been better.
2,Too bad Clancy doesn't review these for the details,"The writing is barely ok and is just OFF for thesubject matter and details.Example: Sam thanks his Krav Maga self defense classes ,at thelocal strip center, for his having the ability to hold his breath for four minutes and make an underwater escape from the enemy instead of his extensive SEAL and Special Ops training.Sure thing."
1,Modern Day Unrealistic Superman,"I got misled by Clancy's name--the ""hero"" of this story is extremely, unrealistically, impervious to hordes of enemies, vanquishing all with impunity and mostly with his bare hands. No suspense here, as the reader ALWAYS knows he'll come out without a scratch. GET REAL!!!"
1,Repulsive Reading,"I couldn't stand this book. It cussed ""f"" all the time, and went into description in the sex scenes. Seein that this video game is played by kids and that they are most likely to read it... I just found it disgusing and uninteresting. The plot seemed average, like just another spy story. I'd steer clear of this."
2,Mediocre writing based on an excellent game,"This book begins on a positive note. There's action, some description of Sam fisher's cool gear, and a bit of a plot. But after a couple chapters it gets really bland. The author (not tom clancy) has a writing style that is pretty ordinary, with some weird perspectives thrown in. For example, the first person style takes a while to get used to, and seems confusing when the author cuts to different scenes (like the villains talking for example) that don't have a 1st person perspective.There isn't a ton of cool action, just a lot of mediocre action. The writer's pace doesn't even change when he's describing it either, just keeps on plowing through the story. Even the sex content isn't exciting.Overall I'd label this book a bland Clancy knock-off that is only worth reading if you are snowed in for days with nothing else to do."
2,Not good,"I bought this book in an airport bookstore. I was duped as I thought it was a Tom Clancy book. After reading the first page I figured it out.I have never played the game, just saw a commmercial on TV some time ago. The game looked interesting. The book was not.First off, you have to get over the first-person narrative style. The guy is talking about himself as if he is recounting it to someone, though he would never really recount it if he was so deep undercover. A third-person narrative would've made more sense.The characters were hollow and very predictable and I never felt engaged with the story. It kept hinting at something big that never came."
3,Enjoyable Read,"If you're looking for an in depth, well written novel, you'd be wise to stay away from this one. However, what appealed to me about this was its simplistic writing/story-telling style. If you want something that makes for an easy read and doesn't require any additional thought, this book is perfect. It was nice to just sit down and cruise through this story, knowing that I wasn't missing any important underlying messages. I'm not saying this to bash the book though. Honestly, I really did find this to be a very enjoyable read, and would recommend it to anyone who is in to this type of story and just wants to let their mind be entertained."
1,Middle School Excitement,"Only a middle schooler could love this book. Only a middle schooler could read this book. Only a middle schooler could possibly have written this book. (My apologies to middle schoolers everywhere!)Tom Clancy is a great story teller, but will never be accused of being a great writer. That being said, there's no way Tom Clancy ever read this book, let alone wrote any of it. If he had read it he wouldn't have willingly put his name on it.Save your money and buy a Nelson Demille novel!"
2,Good idea but disappointing execution,"Let me start out by saying how interesting the idea of a Splinter Cell is in practice. The book's premise is very interesting and the plot line is good as well, but that's where the positives of this book stop.The writing style of the author seems to be playing to the lowest common denominator. There are entire sections of the book that read: ""I do this. I do that. I go back to doing this other thing. I then go to do this. I start doing this."" There isn't much to say about the variety of sentence structure here.This was overall a disappointing read especially considering that Tom Clancy's name is pasted on the front cover of this book."
2,Blah. Don't Waste Your Time,"This book was a rather shallow read. Yes, I did cruse through it in a few days, but that was more because I had nothing to do than it being a good book. If you're a big Clancy fan, don't bother with this. These sorts of books are cash cows for him and just ways for bad writers to get some exposure. I think the biggest problem I had with this book is that it's too James Bond-ish in style. There isn't the depth and reality like an actual Clancy novel usually will carry. Yeah, Michaels does give some detail about a few things, but the scope of the book seemed rushed and poorly constructed. Like I said, I understand that these aren't meant to be massive publications of sweeping genius. They're cash cows that Clancy can slap his name on. It will keep you entertained for a long plane ride, but you'll forget it the second you put it down."
5,Splinter Cell-ahoholic!!!!!!!,"Splinter Cell is the best book I ever read!! It's an action packed, on the edge of your seat book. I had just turned 12 when I finished it. This book inspired me to get more Tom Clancy books. Tn fact, I just recently purchased Splinter Cell Operation Barracuda. Can't wait to start reading it. Anyway, this book is highly recomended to those who want to read about spys and futuristic gadgets and stuff like that."
3,Maybe it should have stayed just a game,"The Splinter Cell series has been a great gaming experience; however, I can not say the same for the book. I was very excited when I found out there was a Splinter Cell book, but after I read it, I was disappointed. I expected a lot more from the book, but it was pretty boring. Some parts were interesting, but the story line was very predictable. If you are a fan of Sam Fisher, maybe this book is worth reading.Pros: Gives you a little more insight on the life of Sam FisherCons: Story is to predictableOverall: If you are going to buy it, buy it used because you will probably never read it again."
3,"Not bad, but not that good either","This book is all right. At first I had a hard time getting used to the writing style, it's very short and choppy. ""I did this. I did that. I drove here."" Gets pretty boring, however, if you've played the Splinter Cell games, that's almost how the character of Sam Fisher is. The book really shines in the sections that are written in third person, there is some really quality descriptions in those sections of the book, and you can vividly picture the action in your head.Unfortunately though, the book is written as if you have zero knowledge of the Splinter Cell universe. Don't be fooled by the Tom Clancy name on the cover, though, because it's not as good as a classic Clancy book, too short, too choppy, and there are some serious deviations from accepted Splinter Cell canon."
3,About What You Should Expect,"This is the novelization of a video game. Since you become Sam Fisher in the game, the book was initially a bit off-putting to me because it did not reflect the Sam Fisher I had created in my mind. Once I overcame that obstacle, it was an average read. You can't expect great things from a book that is-1: Presented by, not written by Tom Clancy and,2: Based on a video game.With all that out of the way, it deserves its three stars. If you're looking for War and Peace, look elsewhere. If you're looking for an average spy novel that you can read on an airplane , by all means pick it up."
5,Very engaging account- hard to put down,Rhea's followup to his account of the Battle of the Wilderness is even better than its predecessor. Military history done right.
5,The Best Living Civil War Historian,"For a serious student of Civil War history there is no living historian equal to Mr. Rhea. His trilogy covering the Overland Campaign commencing with the Battle of the Wilderness, and followed by this volume covering the Spotsylvania battles and completed with his coverage of the North Anna engagement constitute the most entertaining and enlightening history of recent years. Mr. Rhea closes his North Anna account with the sentence, ""Destiny waited at an obscure Virgina crossroads named Cold Harbor."" Mr. Rhea, I'm waiting for you to take us there soon."
4,More Civil War,"I have recenty - in the past two ot three years - become interested in the Civil War. The Shelby Foote series is wonderful, but still leaves a lot of detail to be fleshed out. The more you read the more you want to know. Much about the War remains a mystery. The battles can be presented in much detail and Rhea's writing is clear and lucid. There is considerable detail in presenting excerpts from diaries, reports and the like to make the battles real from a human standpoint. The books are much like the work of Stephan Sears.All are well written and enjoyable, although I do recommend a bit of lighter reading between volumes.The only quibble that I have is with the maps. They often neglect detail that could help follow the action. Plaaces mentioned in the text are sometimes not to be found on the maps.This complaint can be applied to virtually every Civil War book that I have read. If you are interested in the civil war, this series is excellent."
5,Native american music,I have used his cd for years to help me sleep at night -- wore out the orginal had to replace it
5,She really seemed to love it,A nice and colorful little pin. It was smaller than I imagined it but she thinks it is just right.
2,poor colours,"I gave this product only 2 stars, because it wasn‚Äôt that good as it was described here. on the photo brooch has bright colours, but when I received the product I was really disappointed.colours were very poor. moreover the brooch has crack. for product, that is absolutely ordinary (no gold, no silver, no gemstones) and has visible defect, 78 dollars are more than expensive."
2,No good!,I purchased this umbrella to replace an old on I got from wal-mart. I now what my wa-mart one back. It was so much better than this one. This one will not last much longer and I have had it for 3 months and yes I have taken good care of it. It is hard to open. Try a different umbrella just not this one.
2,A stability ball book should have more exercises actually on the ball,"As indicated by my review title, I didn't like this book. I ordered it and once I saw it I immediately returned it. About half the exercises are ""on"" the ball while the others are exercises simply holding the ball or putting it between the legs. It doesn't seem to take advantage of the instability or range of motion that the ball allows. The exercises may be effective but I didn't want a book where I could easily perform the exercises without the ball."
5,Excelent!,This book brings very creative exercises on the ball and is the first book I know that brings aerobic conditioning on the ball. The author also explains very well all the positions. Very good for those that want to exercise at home like myself.
4,ANOTHER MANS WOMEN available on this,this is a must have for supertramp fans rick davies stellar keying on another mans woman is awesome as well as some of best hits interperated nicely. great sound horns guitars vocals and keyboards plus whistling and harmonica too give that special touch . get before this version goes into obscurity
4,if you want to Give A Little Bit,"As far as I know, Supertramp has not produced a live cd/album which includes their awesome hit ""Give A Little Bit.""If you are like me, and want to get a live version of Give A Little Bit, venture out and buy a copy of King Biscuit Flower Hour: Presents Ringo Starr Live. That cd has Supertramp's very own Roger Hodgson doing this song (at a longer-than-studio length of 5:13), plus The Logical Song and Take The Long Way Home. You'll even get Greg Lake doing a fabulous version of Lucky Man, and that Ian Hunter dude singing All The Young Dudes.No, I'm not on Starkey's payroll, but please do tip your waitresses... I'll be here all week giving free tips."
4,Nice live album,"This is a great new live album from Supertramp. The best Supertramp song ever ""Another mens women"" is the greatest song i have heard. Try this."
1,Question,hello! this seems a very interesting live cd but I have a doubt. several people mentioned the song another's man woman but I don't see that song in the listing. is there another import edition of this cd besides this one? please anybody could clarify this? Thanks! anyway any concert of supertramp with or without hogdson is worth the price!!!
5,Corelle Scandia White Dishware set,"I love this Corelle Ware dish set. We have now had a set of 12 for a couple of years. They still look great and have a great shine even though we use them daily and we clean them in the dishwasher. This model has a heavier feel (is thicker) than the normal Corelle Dishes. It is well worth the few extra bucks to get this top of the line model of Corelleware. I have always liked Corelleware because it is tough and it wears so well. You can almost not break these dishes. This dinner set has a classy look and can be used for your upscale dinners.......so when we have guest over, we don't always get out the fine china. The square design with the grooves on the lips of the plates really looks great and they are practicle with two sizes of plates incuded. The smaller plates, bowls and coffee cups are all attractive and functionable. I highly recommend these dishes and the bright clear over white finish goes with anything."
2,Beautiful But Difficult To Clean,"I have had different patterns of Corelle over the years, and this material is different - it is heavier and has a much more luxurious feel.The big surprise is how difficult it is to handwash them. Oil seems to stick to the fluted sides of the plates like glue, and I have to add extra soap and scrub extra hard to get it off. The cups are the most difficult to clean - all of them have coffee stains on the inside that I cannot remove. I don't know if they will fare any better in a dishwasher - someone else will have to comment on that.I am now in the market to purchase another set of Corelle in the traditional material. Not as nice or as luxurious, but certainly less stressful."
2,Manufacturing problems,"I bought 2 sets for me, but both came with different manufacturing problems... wrinkles on the borders... color differences on the edge... I love Corelle and still think is a good product, but dont expect it to be perfect. I am thinking about waiting a couple more months and try to buy them again to see if they improved the manufacturing process."
4,Good Dishes,"I bought these dishes because I have arthritis and picking up heavy stoneware dishes was becoming very painful. I had used Corelle before and knew that they were very light and the whole not braking thing was a bonus. Saying that I have to add that these dished are not as light as the old set I had. They are lighter than the stoneware but only a little. I will use them until it becomes to painful, then I will start my hunt for the lighter ones again.I wanted to add that they were delivered in good shape and on time. I buy a lot of stuff from Amazon and the only time I have any problems is when dealing with the carriers that ships the merchandise."
2,silver-plated PLASTIC,"When I read the words ""silver-plated"" I thought that it meant metal. Sadly, it is electroplated plastic. The belt looks alright from a distance, but it has no weight and comes apart easily. At least it is cheap."
4,Chic Dining!,"My husband and I received two sets of this as a wedding present almost a year and a half ago. I had no idea this item was available on Amazon until just now. I unfortunalty broke a bowl and am looking to replace it. The set has had daily use and been through countless dishwashing cycles. The plates and bowls do show scratches, but that is to be expected. This dinnerware WILL break if dropped; in addition to the bowl today, I broke a little plate several months ago. I was surprized that the bowl broke, as it only fell a foot or so (I was unloading the dishwasher and it slipped out of my hand). I love the way the plates look on the table, so I'd like to replace the broken items so we can have a full set. Overall, this is a good dinnerware set at a reasonable price. I plan on replacing the broken plate and bowl, and may even add to our dining experience with the serving bowl and salt and pepper shakers."
2,Paper Jam!,"Paper Jam! Every time! Print, Paper, Paper Jam! It should just print, only occasionally jamming upon moments of emotional self reflection and technological epiphany! Paper Jam!"
2,This printer is alot of hassle,I don't know if other printers are like this but this Canon pixma MP160 guzzles expensive ink like a Saudi Arabian marathon runner guzzles water freaken A!! so I tried using remanufactured ink it worked for awhile then somesort killswitch screwed up my printer so I got Canon ink again it worked then I ran out of ink so I got more Canon ink but I'm getting a errorE Aghhh so frustrating!!
2,"Google ""MP160 Paper Jam""","I've had this printer for less than a year, using it about 10 pages per week for documents, and about five 4X6 photos per week. Recently started jamming or feeding 3-4 sheets at a time. Normal paper, photo paper, card stock...didn't matter. Ran the on-board roller cleaning procedure multiple times, with no luck. Finally Googled ""MP160 Paper Jam"" and learned that this unit is notorious for jamming.I recommend that you avoid this printer."
3,Good Printer for the Money,"I purchased the Canon Pixma MP160 all-in-one about a month ago. I am happy with it overall, and feel that it is the best printer I could have gotten for the money that I paid for it. The print quality is pretty good, text comes out fine, and the scanner and copier work well too. The printer is not great with design program such as Photoshop and Freehand because you cannon control much of the printer options such as quality and paper type, but I knew not to expect too too much from a printer under a hundred dollars. Another perk is the fact that the ink seems to be less expensive than many other ink cartridges out there, and that is always good since we end up spending more on the ink than the printer itself. Overall I'm happy with the purchase, but it is meant to be a temporary solution until I can afford a nice color laser printer."
4,"low cost, high value printer","Not the best printer, photo printer, copier -- but a great low cost solution if you want all three in a limited space."
3,"does not print pictures well. other than that, fine","ok so if you are looking for a printer that prints quality photos, dont buy this printer. if you are just looking for a printer that prints great quality documents, buy it. but the photos are hardly crisp and lack detail. i was very disappointed in that respect. but i did buy it during black friday also, and only paid 20. so how can i expect quality photos when paying that price? right? other than that, its a fine printer for the money."
1,Avoid at all costs,"This printer worked great for about a month, before it started jamming every sheet of paper that was fed into it. This was my first and last Canon printer purchase. I'm going back to HP Printers."
2,Broke after less than a year,"The print and scan quality are good for the price. The ink cartridges won't get you very far, but this didn't really bother me because I don't do that much printing. However, this printer just broke, and I've had it for less than a year. AND I don't even use it that much. Poor quality for a $170 printer."
3,Canon PIxma MP 160 printer review,"The Canon Pixma MP 160 printer is a fairly convenient printer and prints quickly. It lacks the ability to copy documents more than one page at a time, since you must place the item to be copied flat on the document screen prior to copying.However having a flat document screen does make it easier to copy a page from a book or magazine that can't be done easily on some other printers.The color copying is very good, and the colors are clear and seldom need adjusting.I received this printer in used ""very good"" condition and it works fine."
3,Canon Pixma MP-160 All purpose Printer,"Recently purchased this multi-purpose printer. Actually was a purchase to replace in-kindprinter which experienced mechanical damage. Only negative aspect of the original MP-160 was, in my opinion, the ink cartridge replacement costs. I find Canon cartride replacements, very expensive. Not much experience, with printer ink, but found sources to buy remanufactured cartridges and ultimately, a re-fill mail center, whcih reduced the ink costs in half.The original MP-160 was destroyed by an pen falling into the paper feed, and unaware ot this incident, I attempted to operate the unit and caused mechanical damage. I ordered anexact replacement (used) and am quite satisfied with my purchase. My printing requirements are small and am not certain what the reliability and efficiency of this particular printer would be under heavy service; but as an average consumer, I could recommend this unit to all.Dana BourgeoisCanon PIXMA MP160 All-In-One Photo Printer (Gray)"
1,paid but never received,"i can't review an item i paid for but never received, but i can amazon. i ordered this item almost a month ago and i am still waiting to get it. i think amazon should take a little more responsibility for items sold on its website."
3,printer cable,Does anyone know if this printer come with the cable that connects to the computer?it doesn't seem to be included in the box
2,Ink Obsorber Came out on 6th Page,"I also bought the $20 Best Buy Black Friday MP160. My old Printer just ran out of ink so I'm just getting to setting it up. I aligned everything, and it was working great. On about the 6th page, the paper jammed. I pulled it out, ran another page through and it spit out the next page along with a piece of foam. The help desk was very responsive and indicated it was the ink obsorber. They are sending me a new Printer in 2 days. This one is still working fine, but they recommended not putting the obsorber back in. Since their support was so good, and everyone else is having good luck, I guess I'll try another one and see how it goes. For $20, I don't have a lot to loose, except time!!"
1,Biniarch is a terrible vendor to deal with!!,"I ordered this printer through Amazon on December 5th and it NEVER made it to me. Biniarch never responded to any of my email requests, but they sure debited my account for the printer promptly. If you see ANYTHING that is listed on Amazon from this vendor...AVOID IT!!!"
3,this boi is not gr8t,this boy is not gr8t he has ugly clothes and ugly eyes he should be call camera off cause who wantz to take a pic of him i mean he not the best eithan rocccckkkkssss!!!!!!!!!!
4,"The track ""Here and Forever""",This song is hauntingly familar. Does anyone know if this track was in a movie? I remember it being longer.....hmmmm.
5,Breathtaking !,This particular CD of Oystein Sevag and Lakki Patey is very rare with both sharing very intense music. It is by far a masterpiece. It is in a class of its own and you will be amazed at the talent of these Norwegian composers. It would be best fit that you place yourself in the center of this music so that it surrounds you and you will be the judge. A small investment will put you far above what you may imagine. Highly recommended as your past reviewers have done as well.
4,Peaceful Stuff,"A great end of the day disc. The kind that you can put on and sit down to with your favorite beverage. Or place quietly in the background to create, sustain, revive a certain mood. Some of the tunes may just reach out and touch you.If you like anything from the Windham Hill or Narada lables then you'll want to give this a listen. If you ever get stressed and want to get rid of it you'll do well to buy this. (It's less than a massage and you can carry it with you).4 Stars, recommended for ""mood"" listening.(Searching the Obscure, Lusting for the Sublime...Just Listen!)"
4,Fun book!,"My daughter has a fascination for monsters, so I knew that she would adore this book. Now she has a book about a monster that I can read to her at bedtime without worry of bad dreams. It's a very cute story."
1,monster books for kids,"My son is obsessed with monsters. He absolutely loves this book. The story is really cute, and it's a great bedtime story because it isn't just a 3 page book. It gives you time to get the kids settled in, and they can enjoy reading with you."
3,"Not a fast charger, but it is reliable","I expected an hour tops based on the product title, but have experienced up to six hours of charge time. It does have independent charging channels and a trickle charge feature to maintain charges once fully charged. Buy it for the great price, but don't buy it if you need speed."
4,the blowers daughter ...a lovely piece of music!!,"I enjoy the tv show...Covert Affairs...and Tuesday night at the end of the show,this lovely song was played. I did some searching to find out the name of it.It is in this album.....it is used in the movie CLOSER.It is a very lovely and haunting melody.I am sure the rest of the album will be great as well."
3,it grows on you,"I bought this album for one song- the Blowers Daughter. I couldn't get the song on its own, so I thought I would just buy the album. the first time I listened I was a little turned off by the arrangments and the songs chosen. these are all well-known songs and in my personal opinion some of them sound just too strange to be sung by a choir. However, after playing it in my car for a few days I simply fell in love with about 3 more of the songs and that makes it all worth it to me."
3,Price change,"I bought this last month for $39, big price jump to 50. I just checked for local store online and it's 41. Guess it's to Petco for me."
1,Just a beach ball.,What a huge waist of money. This think is nothing more than a beach ball made to look like a globe. It is very thin and will not last long.
2,Not the Real Deal,"Sex-O-Rama is OK, but it's remakes of 70s adult soundtracks INSPIRED by the originals. Not the real deal. For those who would like a taste of actual soundtrack gems from the golden age of adult film, check out DEEP NOTE: Music of 1970s Adult Cinema. Over one hour (40 tracks!) of funk, straight-ahead jazz, groovy fuzz rock, Bruce Haack/Jean Jacques Perry style analog synth, and kitschy soundtrack cheese all served up in a truly eye-popping, six-panel digipak!! DEEP NOTE is an extra tasty portion of 1970s underground pop culture from a more carefree, liberated time. Check it out. It's a stone groove!"
5,WOW.....,"wow,this thing is unreal....i was turned on by this band by exposure to the trailer for the film ""stuntrocker"" - a bit of extreme 70's bad-film nastiness.what caught my attention was the music...a curious mix of ""heavy metal"" with southern california party-rock.imagine if Spinal Tap where a REAL band,and not a parody(at least not a blatantly obvious one).lyrics are ridiculous,riffs are kinda cheesy but fairly heavy & fuzzy (fu manchu,anyone??)for the time.All N.W.O.B.H.M fans (though they arent British),""stoner rock"" fans & assorted heavy metal historians consider this an essential purchase!!"
2,Caution! This book is simply Part II of Little Women,"This is a great book, and my favorite part of Little Women. It covers the part when Jo goes to New York and meets Professor Bhaer. However, when I ordered ""Good Wives"" I thought it was a sequel that I hadn't read before. Instead I found that it was a poorly bound and poorly copied (e.g. faint print that's hard to read) copy of Part II of the book Little Women. If you have the novel Little Women you already have ""Good Wives."" I sat the books down side by side and compared them, and they are identical. I'm confused why everyone is referring to this as a sequel to Little Women, unless perhaps when Little Women first came out it ended when the father came home from the war, and maybe Part II was originally printed in a separate volume?However, every copy I've ever picked up of Little Women nowadays already has Part II in it, so if you have Little Women I'd advise you not to waste your money on this."
4,A worthy sequel,"Sequel seldom works but this book is better then the first one, 'cause it explores the minds of it's charecters more truthfully then the first one.Here in this book they look more real and alive.The lose of the Beth is the great one but they bear it truely. Jo's charecter comes out so vividly that it dominated the whole book.It was a delight to read this book."
2,NOT a sequel to Little Women--just chapters 24-47 of the original,"I feel compelled to write a review on all these different versions of GOOD WIVES. This is good literature, but there is no reason to buy this book if you're planning to read LITTLE WOMEN, as every copy of LITTLE WOMEN contains these chapters. LITTLE WOMEN is divided into ""Part First"" and ""Part Second,"" and GOOD WIVES = ""Part Second."""
2,NOT a sequel to Little Women,"As another reviewer noted, THIS IS NOT A SEQUEL TO LITTLE WOMEN. I pulled out my copy of Little Women, and the chapters in Good Wives are exactly the same as the second half of the book Little Women. If that wasn't clear: my copy (and every copy I remember) of Little Women contains ""Part First"" and ""Part Second."" GOOD WIVES = ""Part Second."" I can't think of any reason to buy this book.However, the book LITTLE WOMEN is great, and I can think of a million reasons to buy it! (I hate giving anything Louisa May Alcott wrote only 2 stars--but those are for the packaging, not the text.)"
1,Don't buy it -- its chapters are already in Little Women,"If you have Little Women, you already have these chapters. The chapters of Good Wives have been tacked onto the end of Little Women, so there's no need to buy them separately."
2,Potentially good reference needs more work,"Despite nice illustrations and photos, this work suffers most from poor organization. Instead of going through each of the building blocks f Himalayan statuary and iconography, then putting them together (i.e., mudras, vehicles, hand objects, etc.), it is organized (not right word) in a peculiar fashion that resists its use as a reference book. Often it goes into great detail about trivial things, then omits more important things. For example, it clutters the landscape with discussions about different sects - this is really premature. If you read German, my recommendation is buying Wolfgang Schumann's masterful ""Buddhistische Bilderwelt"" [The world of Buddhist Iconography], which you can probably buy from www.amazon.de."
5,great art book and subject for the beginner.,colorfull and well written. as welll .as thames and hudson always delivers a fine product. a real treasure. a great find.
2,They didn't all snap together and the kids keep falling off,"The kids should snap onto the horse, or the fit should be better. It's frustrating to my daughters that the kids keep falling off the horses. Some of the kids are hard to seat on the horses because of how the legs are bent.The 5 are supposed to s nap together. One of them won't snap in because it's prongs are a little too far apart. Not sure how that happened, but it's not good workmanship."
2,Somewhat Dissappointing,"Per ad hype, I anticipated something similar to the writings of Gahndi or Tolstoy on comparable topics. However, this is more a biopic overview of the remarkable work of Mandela with 'notes and commentary' by Tutu. While the Mandela process of forgiveness, in the face of unimaginable atrocities, is very much worth one's study and incorporation, that's not why I bought the book. Desmond does not believe forgiveness is possible w/o perpetrator public confession and request for forgiveness. What happens to a victim's future when the perpetrator[s] is dead, unavailable or unwilling? The relevance of this treatise for us garden-variety souls in a benign democracy is missing."
4,No Future without Forgiveness,"Excellent book for an honest background of the horrors that took place, as well as the introduction of the concept of forgiveness as an absolute counter-cultural event that could take place if hearts could be convinced."
3,Gotta have them...,"The bags are strange. You need them to use the HEPA filter, but the filter takes up the center of the vac tank and the bag kind of tucks down the side and under it. This seems to reduce the volume of the bag and creates a twisted air path through it. I think this contributes to the tears that sometimes develope around the bag's inlet hole.The result of all this is that these bags should be replaced well before they are completely filled and Fein thinks highly of their products and prices them accordingly.Still, they work and I like the Fein vacs per my review. For the price, though, it seems that the bag design could be a bit more clever. As far as I know, there are no aftermart substitutes."
1,These DO NOT work on 9.77.25,"Amazon says that these work on a 9.77.25 they do not, so do not do like I did and buy these to find out later that they do not work on this model. The correct Fein part# is 913064AGA6. FYI"
5,extend filter life and time between cleanings,"These bags, although a bit pricey, extend filter life and greatly extend the amount of time you can use the vacuum before having to empty it out. They make a world of difference! That's because they act like a whole extra filter. To save money, I have found that you can empty them out (over a dumpster, wearing a dust mask) once or twice and reuse, before disposing of them."
5,Fein vacuum bags,"Hi;Received my order from Quality Dist. LLC promptly (ie., there was a delay but it was a result of a miscommunication with my local UPS.) Quality Dist. responded quickly to my email. Fine company. RPK"
5,Winny! God bless your soul,"You can't beat Winny. There's absolutley no silly emotionalism on these recordings. Sir Winston lays it down just as is it. 'Never give up' ""Fight, fight fight"" Toil and trouble... western civilization. blood and guts. This is all fighting stuff made when the Brits were still truely British. Stiff upper lip, never say die and so on. Well, it's nice to play when you are driving home home drunk or listening at home sober with the family. There a lot of wisdom here and let us not forget that while Adolf was screaming death and wacko racism, and eating vegetarian food and not even enjoying good German beer, Winny was plastered up most of the time and tucking into meat pies and steaks. Fanaticism surley does come out in many different manifestations."
3,I can't rate because ...,I sent this as a gift and never heard the CD. I can not rate this because I never listened to it.
4,Visually Photoshop CS,"Very basic instruction,lots of graphic illistration.Book was a requirement for digital photography course being taken at college.Limited coverage in some areas."
5,Our son kept it under his pillow,"This was a magical, powerful book for our son when he was learning to handle bad dreams. He kept it for years--still has it in fact, though he's long since grown. The Dream Eater is a creature who comes to the village to rid young and old of their nightmares. It's an empowering talismanic tale, simply beautifully told and illustrated. It's the kind of book that having created it, the writer and artist can both be proud of what they've done in their lives. Try it out with your child when bad dreams come. It may help you to talk about the dreams, too. Take Me With You When You Go"
4,Interesting Read,"No retelling of Tudor history would be complete without a look into the 6 doomed lives of Henry VIII's wives. Lindsey manages to combine both fact and opinion in this interesting book. Divorced, Beheaded, Survived reads like any other biography, except it adds a feminist twist on many famous events. Famous names include Henry VIII, Catherine of Aragon, Anne Boleyn, and Princess Mary. The story is well researched and accurately depicts royal life; from the plotting, betrayals, and constant struggle for the throne. It also contains quotes from the characters themselves. The only downside is, that in her rush to detail female suffering, Lindsey does stretch the story a bit far. She often strays from the subject of the queens to other independent women. The story also tends to babble on at times. Overall, Divorced, Beheaded, Survived is an appealing, informative book."
4,Getting chummy with royalty,"""I thought I knew"" all about King Henry and his wives, but Lindsey's spirited chronicle gives us a close look at the actual ""gameboard"" for 16th century women, and others who hoped to profit from their accidental (and even unwilling) promixity to the 'seat' of power. Her choice of details seems designed to remind us that ""survived"" was no accident, that Princess Di had a lot of predecessors both in talent and (alas) in luck. In the end you may feel you know Anne of Cleves and Catherine of Aragon ""at least"" as well as our current royalty...all rather chummy but a not unpleasing illlusion."
1,wish I could rate lower,I've got a GREAT idea! I'll rewrite history and make a few easy bucks. The least you could do is file this under fiction with a BIG F.
5,Rhyming Wives,"Confused about Henry's wives? Not all were beheaded.Divorced, Beheaded, DiedDivorced, Beheaded, Survived.Referring to:Catherine of Aragon, Anne Boleyn, Jane SeymourAnne of Cleves, Kathryn Howard, Katherine ParrHow to remember their order?Cate & Jane& 2 Kates again(Cate Anne JaneAnne 2 Kates again)"
1,Don't waste your time,"Not worth the money, time, or effort. The book lacked a scholarly (as well as feminist) point of view, angrily attacking the women as though they wronged her. There are many better ""reinterpretations"" on the market; try them."
5,Crop Circle Secrets,"Crop Circle Secrets Part 1An interesting analysis of crop circles. Published in 1991 and contains 80 pages. Whistlers, lightening noise, sunspots, islands, geometry, Jupiter's cloud bands, dumbbell patterns, King Arthur, magnetic declinations, and radio frequency energy are discussed."
2,I highly doubt that Khaled is behind this release!,"No one doubts the originality and creativity of Khaled's music. On the other hand, this CD seems to be pirated with poor sound quality, and the record label is not Barclay or any other record labels that produce his work! I would recommend buying any other CD from Khaled's collection other than this.Besides that, his album titles are never in English! Please do not support piracy."
2,"the strangely titled ""NOW!"" by Khaled","The ""new"" Khaled cd entitled ""Now!"" appears to be old tracks from before Khaled's international success - with the exception of the 5th track - ""Aiysha"" - which is the same recording as ""Aicha"" from his last cd, ""Sahra."" This is hardly Khaled ""NOW"" - If you have no Khaled yet, you will find unending pleasure in the cds SAHRA, N'SSI N'SSI, KUTCHE, and KHALED. I give all these other records 5 stars ""N'ssi N'ssi"" is my favorite."
4,Music fan from EGYPT.,I think this is not the best CD for khaled but the first track surely worth buying this CD ...
1,Bag of shite - Badly organised and incomplete,"Some parts of the book are well written, succinct and to the point. For example, the second chapter takes you into VB by building a simple image control. Everything you need is in the chapter.However, the rest of the book seems to have been written in a hurry. I think the book could have done with a rewrite. For example, chapter 12 which discusses API calls mentions that API calls are a way to know when a process has terminated. This is given in a list of four other things which are then demonstrated in the chapter, but how to determine if a process has terminated is not explained. In chapter 5 it was promised that this would be explained (see page 219).These are just two critisms amoungst many. The book is just not laid out in a way which will help you learn VB. I have a problem with it and two colleagues at my work place have used the book and compared it unfavourably with others on the market."
2,2-pound bags?,"These are two 1-pound bags, not two 2-pound bags. I don't know if the coffee is GOOD because it's BEANS, and I don't have a grinder."
2,This book is an advertisement for the [price] download,"What a [scheme]. I thought I was purchasing some templates - generic data models oriented for specific industries. This book is a teaser for the author's electronic products, which contain the real templates. This book has just enough information to lead you to believe the electronic product is plausable, but not enough to really use the data models discussed(without the expensive downloads). I expected a bunch of entities with the PK and FK attributes ready for customizing with my company specific attributes... NOT."
5,Is it worth buying a book for only one chapter?,"Yes, it is. Because the other chapters have all sorts of useful content as well. This book covers Manufacturing, Telecommunications, Health Care, Insurance, Financial Services, Professional Services, Travel, and e-Commerce. Most companies, even if they aren't in those sectors, use the services of companies that are (or may do a little bit of them - offer insurance on their products, for example), and if you need to include these areas in your model, in more detail than was covered in volume 1 (the core Universal Data Model book), then this is the place to start. If you are in one of these areas, then the specific chapter has a lot of useful stuff (I have worked in Travel, Telecommunications and Professional Services), but it is well worth checking out the other models for ideas that can be re-used in your area."
2,Model Templates NOT Included!,"As others have stated, the CD included with the book is (effectively) only an advertisement for the models for sale on the web site. Frankly, I find this offensive, since books that have CDs are generally much more expensive because (normally) the CD has additional useful content, CDs cost money to make, etc. I doubt that I would buy another of Mr. Silverston's books after having this disappointing experience. The models themselves seem well thought-out and useful, but if you're looking for something that will save you time and money, you'd be better off purchasing a model from one of the many industry-specific standards organizations (e.g. ACORD). Those models will be much more detailed and recognizable between multiple organizations."
4,"On: Cavalry, Its History & Tactics","A very thorough volume on the mounted sphere of human conflict. Written expertly in the classical style with an historic sense. Focusing on the role of Cavalry as complementary to attritional based warfighting and conflict of varying intensity, it sets out Cavalry as an indispensible asset to national greatness for the western powers it covers.Will leave the reader with the firm opinion that Cavalry Tactics represent a superior means of engaging and destroying enemies, or bypassing resistance in pursuit of lofty ideals, specified goals, force protection, force projection, combat multiplication.Overall one of the most intelligently written and thorough works in the field of Chivalric Literature in Modernity. Highly recommended for all horesemen, military leaders, political scientists, historians and others."
5,American Psychobilly has been perfected!,"Yeah, you like the Cramps. And, yeah, the Reverend is pretty damn cool, too. But no U.S. psychobilly band compares to Speed Crazy, with a style all their own, and yet slightly reminiscent of Brit bands such as the Guanabatz and the the Frantic Flintsones. What I find great about their sound is that that they don't need the hard distortion or poppy progressions that newer psycho bands use; they keep an authentic rockabilly sound but rev it up to the point where toe tappin' becomes foot stompin'! These guys know the old school sound and also how to beat you over the head with it! The music is soon-to-be-classic, the lyrics are great, and the technical ability will definitely impress you, even if you've never heard of Rockabilly before. Buy this record! You won't be disappointed."
3,HOT! HOT! HOT!,The transfer rates of this modem are great but this modem gets way too hot. This modem had to be placed on the floor far from the computer. I returned this modem and got a Linksys and the heat problem is gone. This DLink modem can't be stacked because of the heat
1,Don't buy. Don't waste your money.,not reliable. Very slow speed. And it doesn't support the new tech. Don't waste your money.
1,Not impressive,Ever since I have replaced D link modem in my home from the original comcast modem just to save $7 ....I feel I did the biggest mistake life has become hell with the ind of connect I get after switching to D link...earlier I use to get 54 mBPS however after switching to D link modem I only get 18 MBPS or may be max is 48...that to depends....I'm in follow up with the company but not getting responses I wish change it to other router may be that will help me as my other colleauges are happy using the different model...Wish some one will read this & help me switching to the other model.Amit
4,cable modem,Received it on time and it is working well. I have had no problems with the modem at all. I would buy it again.
3,Professional writers writing professional-sounding accounts of the paranormal,"This book is comprised of many stories in varied settings and situations by authors from all walks of life. In that regard, it is a book that will be interesting and entertaining to many. It becomes quickly obvious, however, from reading the short bios after each tale, that all of the contributors are professional writers. On top of that, in the intro the three editors thank the Editor for ""nipping and tucking, tweaking and adjusting each and every word, every comma, every nuance...."" and it shows. Unfortunately, for me, it shows in how polished and yes, at times, artificial sounding the stories are. While I really enjoy when a ""ghost book"" is well written, this one takes it to a new extreme. Having said all this, again, the content is broad, some chapters have more substance than others, and I'm sure that there are many readers who will enjoy this book and disagree completely with my comments!"
5,Excellent toy,"For the people who love the Star Wars old toys, this is a perfect choice. And the price was the best; I think is more fun this today."
4,For Quiet Moments,"When the Holidays get too hectic and you just want to decompress with a glass of wine or a book, this is the album to play. Soft but not corny, this music is very soothing with just enough of the Christmas traditional touch. Sometimes I get tired of always hearing the same old Christmas songs rehashed by this artist and that artist. These songs are a nice departure from this. Well worth every penny. S."
5,Great music deal!,Buying this item through Amazon.com is one of the smartest music purchases I've ever made. I intend to buy more music this way in the future.
5,Windham Hill Winter Soltice 5,Not your ordinary Christmas Music CD. What a nice change to the typical Holiday music selections. The whole collection is very moving. If you want a change of pace try this one!
2,read the fine print this was a cassette,Don't know cant play it it was a cassette not a CD and I should have read it more carefully. Be cautious and pick slowly.
5,Eyewitness - Glossy Photos -Easiest Travel Guide,I have all of the Eyewitness Travel Books & for my most recent trip to New York City enroute to Paris and then on to the Riviera....I loved this one because you will identify the building when you are traveling (in my case...always Solo) and my travels become so easy.I highly recommend this line of books.
5,Grerat helper,"I was recommended to buy this product by a friend - great helper when exploring the city.You have maps, admissions (eventhough not always correct), opening times and where to eat as well.Absolutely amazing value for your money."
2,"Lots of glossy pictures, but not very much information.","I am new to living in New York and was looking for a book with substance, as well as pictures illustrating the narrative. This book looked great, but I found it disappointing and ended up returning it. It does a nice job giving a visual overview of the city and attractions, but it fails to provide much depth via writing. If you are expecting any historical information or a description of the area beyond visuals, you will not be pleased.I ended up buying the Insight City Guide (made by the Discovery Channel) of New York instead. I highly recommend it! It provides a number of big, glossy pictures, but it also contains writing to give the reader a greater sense of depth and understanding."
3,Caballe's Magic,"Caballe at the height of her powers, in 1967. She always comes through in front of a live audience. The character's love and anguish all expressed through perfect musicianship. Cappuccilli also fine. Unfortunately, the tenor role makes demands the tenor cannot fulfill. Worth having for Caballe."
4,Caballe in prime time,"I agree with the previous review, but for the price and sound quality it is a wise investmentHaving two readings of the same work, makes CD listening more profound and enjoyable. This CD is an excellent second choice"
3,Pretty good but don't use too much - will make hair greasy,"This product is pretty good to help tame the frizz but you have to use just the right amount because too little doesn't do the trick and too much makes hair look greasy! I wish it helped soften hair also but it doesn't, and in fact may actually have the opposite effect depending on the amount used.This product is rather thick so I dilute with water to help it spread through hair. Has a decent scent to it - nothing floral or cloying. Probably could smell better than it does though.. actually wish it did!I use it because my hairdresser uses it at the salon I go to but I am honestly trying out something else that I like the scent of, that softens my hair and also does the job. Going to try Curly Sexy Hair and see how that works. I have heard great things.. we'll see."
1,If you want to print custom paper,"If you want to print custom paper (like 3x5 or 4x6 index cards), be aware that this software may not work with your printer and tech support absolutely refuses to answer anything that has printer in the email.I had V5.0 working fine and updated to V7.0. My custom 4x6 cards now print off the page with increasing indents. I had to write a helper program which takes an exported recipe and formats it into Microsoft Word in order to print."
5,MY REVIEW ABOUT MASTERCOOK DELUXE,THIS SOFTWARE IS EXCELLENT AND INTERESTING. I HAVE BOUGHT THE OTHER COLLECTION OF MASTERCOOK AND THEY ARE VERY USEFUL TO FIND THE RECIPES YOU WANT. THANKS VERY MUCH
5,One of my all time favorite children's books,"I discovered this book more than ten years ago when I was teaching preschool.Elisa Kleven is a wonderful artist and story teller. I made a bulletin board of the lion and bird, and the children created animals and flowers which were added all year. I give this book as a gift to every friend who is a parent or teacher of children. Her other books are charming as well, but this story of friendship and the joy of creativity is still my favorite!"
5,Beautiful story,"My 3 year old daughter loved this book, with its original storyline and beautiful drawings splashed across the pages. We've read this over and over. The first time we read it, she made a point of finding her papa and telling him the story as well. She showed him the picture that she liked the most (the one where the lion saves the cat). After I put her down for bed, I immediately went back to Amazon to buy more of Elisa Kleven's stories."
1,the biggest joke is that they considered this humor.,"The ""jokes"" depend heavily on the use of shocking language, insults, crudity, and just aren't very funny. I know two people who love this performer-- while everyone else I have met who knows him hates the performer and his material.If bad is funny-- this doesn't make it even then."
1,So funny it blew away my jetty!,"If you enjoy the musings eternally etched into the sheet metal of every toilet stall in America, you will hate this CD because the jokes are twice as lame and four times as old."
4,Great!,"When I bought this CD at one of their concerts, I sort of knew what was coming. And I was not dissapointed. This album combines rock and country, and makes it sound GOOD. Possibly the best song on this album is ""Alberta"". Unfortunately, The Uncas have disbanded, but this is still a great album to have in your collection!"
3,Only ONE chapter worth the three stars - helpful,"Not the best of Big Al's books - overall I learn a main key from all his books that help my training for a successful business. In this book, The Secret Ingredient chapter is worth the price of the book IF you are interested in showing your business opportunity at local Fairs and Trade Shows. He gives a very good idea to garner a lot of attention and fun at YOUR booth."
4,Surprise ending makes the story,"Moon Blossom is the daughter of a poor family in old Hong Kong, who tries to earn a few extra pennies for her mother by running errands for people she meets on the street. One day a mysterious old woman - almost a ""fairy godmother"" type - tips Moon Blossom with a penny made of gold, which sets off a chain of ""good luck"" events for Moon Blossom's family. So far, this story reads like a standard moral tale of ""little girl works hard and does good deeds, and is rewarded"" until the old woman reappears, and reveals the true nature of the lucky golden penny. I read this book when I was about 9 years old and definitely did NOT see that ending coming, although it's a happy one. The illustrations are charming as well. Recommended for children who enjoy an interesting plot twist."
2,Not what I expected,"I knew these brushes would not be amazing at the price, however the bristles were all over the box even before I took them out of their packaging.Very difficult to use as they are falling apart."
1,"Wrong info, expensive returns",Poorly advertised and misleading. Didn't work in my printer when it said it would. Interrogating customer service. Expensive returns. Will sell on Ebay instead.
5,Excelent!!!,"The book was not only VERY cheap, but also in extremely good conditions! I feel like buying three more, just because it is so cheap.When I bought if for 5 dollars I was very suspicious whether the book was actually going to be a book or just the cover or something... but was I wrong! It barely looks used!Furthermore, it is an excellent encyclopedia. I use it as a resource for a college-level science fiction class and I recommend it for the multiple valuable pictures it has and for the timelines of SF. The written part is not as brilliant, but for 5 dollars, you can't go wrong. Useful for little kids, for old folks, and for college students.After reading this and some other, deeper and harder book about SF (I recommend Adam Roberts' ""Science Fiction: the New Critical Idiom""), you will never watch movies or read science fiction like before."
3,Al Jolson,"Disk #1 had an issue and wouldn't play, but #2 was fine. Had to return set due to the flaw. But the recording on #2 was very good and the sound was great. Al Jolson's voice was captured the same as in the movie about him. Very good sound and too bad the one disk had an issue."
4,Times and styles change,"It's interesting how styles and tastes change over time. It's been said Jolson was the greatest entertainer of his time, but I was surprised by his delivery: limited vocal range and generally unchanged expressiveness from song to song. They are almost ""talked."" I was interested in the lyrics of those old songs, and he certainly enunciated very clearly, so that met my need."
5,excellent,Great service. The movie is excellent and I highly recomend it. Not a movie for small kids but a great mystery with several surprises.
5,plain truth,this is a very good movie about the amish farming community mariska hargitay is excellent as well as alison pill this moie is very good this one of lifetimes best movie a 4 star rateding.
4,Solid 4+ Stars,Excellent movie. Solid performances by the entire cast. Allison Pill and Mariska Hargitay prove that they can shine in demanding roles. Unexpected plot twists tied to the interplay between the Amish and modernday cultures heighten the drama and character development. You'll miss out on a good movie if you fall victim to the bias that made-for-TV productions aren't worth seeing on DVD. This one is better than many bigger budget Hollywood movies. Buy it. It's worth adding to your collection.
2,A dissapointing movie from a wonderful novel!,"While reading Jodi Picoult's novel, I could picture the scenes forming into a movie in my head. I then ran across it on here, and had to buy it.All I can say is that I was very, very disappointed. The characters are not developed, the storyline is weak, and it was crammed into such a short time that it hurts the telling of what is a truly amazing story."
4,pretty good,I pretty muck picked this up based on Mariska Hargitay on Law & Order. This could have been better as a series than a movie. Mariska is wonderful as always. Its a shame she doesn't get top Hollywood roles.
1,Big disappointment,"What a horrible ending! Great story until the last 5 minutes, which ruined the entire story. I ended up throwing the dvd into the trash. I think the author didn't have a clear understanding, and then portrayal, of the Amish with that last scene.Notwithstanding the acting was very well done."
1,Horrible,"Most Lifetime movies aren't worth watching (unless you're in the mood for, well, a Lifetime movie), but this one actually looked promising. For the most part, it was interesting, up until the ""surprising twist,"" which nearly caused me to vomit. I would never recommend this to anyone, it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I've seen some bad ones. Go check out My Stepson, My Lover instead."
3,Fits Craftsman pole saw head.,"I ordered this product as it was the only one I located which fit the craftsman pole saw head I have. Overall, this product was disappointing. It is very thin and flimsy; also it is not very sharp and does not cut as well as other replacement blades I have ordered for pole saws. Good opportunity here for a U.S.A. company to make a better product that this import."
5,"Informative, and fun to read.","If you are a English speaker, and want to learn real Internal Chinese Qi Gong, then this is the way to go! It is the first book, in English, that really reveals to the English speakers, and as the title suggests, serects and benefits of Qigong cultivation. Dr. YanXin is a most famous QiGong master that has lead the Qi Gong up surge both in China, and else where in the world. The book contains information about scientific QiGong reasearch and development, as well as high level qigong methods not accessible any where else. You can't go wrong by reading this book."
5,Absolutely delightful!,"This book is a gem. Think Dave Barry and Bill Bryson and you will just have started on the delights and laughs in this book. If you love to travel, even better!! This book was laugh-out-loud funny and I live in the same state with the Barbed Wire Museum. Cash finds a way to have fun with the sights he sees, yet is mostly self-deprecating, so he isn't making fun of the people he meets - there isn't anything cruel about his humor. I can recommend this without hesitation to travel buffs and those looking for a great laugh alike."
4,Good Battery book for off-grid,"This book was helpful to me, in understanding more detailed info on lead-acid batteries.Living off-grid on 12 big (125#) batteries, meant maintenance, and I wanted to know more."
3,"Good info, NOT a ""book""!","The information contained in this book(let) may be ""essential knowledge"" but it is not at all ""secret"". If this booklet was $2 or less with free shipping it would be a borderline value, but at $9 with shipping it's a poor value. The information contained within is readily available elsewhere for anyone with web access & an interest in alternative power systems. My recommedation is not to purchase it."
5,HARD TO FIND ITEM,"IT TOOK ME A LONG TIME TO FIND THIS PRODUCT. I LOOKED AT ALL THE MAJOR DEPARTMENT STORES AND DRUG STORES. FINALLY I WENT TO THE INTERNET AND GUESS WHAT THERE IT WAS. NOT ONLY DID I FIND IT, I GOT TWO FOR THE PRICE OF ONE. THIS LOTION MAKES YOUR SKIN FEEL SO REFRESHED."
1,Smelled funny,"Maybe because it was water based, I don't know. I looked for the gel everyone raved about, but I can't find it anywhere (I went with another product instead for the gel). But this stuff had a slight foul water smell. Like a soggy dish towel, but not as potent. It was covered up by whatever perfume is in it, but I still smelled it. I wasn't impressed, used a portion of one bottle, and tossed the rest. I won't buy it again."
4,Weed Eater Replacement Spool,"I bought this as a replacement spool for my electric ""Twist N Edge"" trimmer. The spool fits perfectly on the trimmer. This replacement string performs the same as the original string. I did not rate this product 5 stars because I would like to have more string on the spool."
4,Weed Eater Cord...,t can I say about this product? It's weed eater cord. It was what I expected it to be. And it works fine. I think the model of weed eater it fits is being discontinued and couldn't find it anywhere. Bought extra so we'd have enough.
1,dosent fit,"i bought this same spool when i got my weed eater and it was easy to replace,i recently ordered another replacment spool of the same kind but this one dosnt fit!"
2,Buy refill string,I don't know what I was thinking. If your reel is good just buy the refill string and rewind. It's a good product and can be useful if you keep it refilled for a quick change.
5,Finally,"Tried to find this at all our stores and no luck, then I found it here.Great service and speedy delivery, will shop here again."
3,tap n go,"This product seems to be intended for very light duty. Fortunately that is my situation. It does always run, however, the spool runs out fairly quickly. I would not buy this product again."
5,Looking Back,"This is a beautiful and poignant remembrance of a woman who lived many years ago, looking back on her past as an egypitian queen as she lies on display in a museum. A really fantastic children's book with gorgeous illustrations."
5,greatest one egg pan ever,This pan is great eggs fit perfect on English muffin or those those flat breads to make breakfast sandwiches on.. even a burger. If you have a problem flipping the egg with just the pan do it over the sink you will get use to it and it will be a breeze also spray a little Pam in pan.its the best pan ever and people who give it one star can't cook if the egg is to dark its cause your heat is to high and you can't cook. If one egg is your mission buy buy buy!!!
2,Too small,"I wanted a small skillet to cook just one egg, so I thought this would be ideal. Before I ordered it I even got out a tape measure to give me an idea of the size. The size is exactly as described, but I didn't take in to consideration that it would be too small to use a spatula to flip the egg. I'll buy another skillet a little bigger."
3,Nice but you will need the flipper,I bought this thinking it would be easy to make an egg to fit on english muffins. If you do buy this pan make sure you buy the flipper. It is practically impossible to flip an egg without it.
2,Poor Quality - Don't Buy!,I used this pan twice cooking ONLY eggs in it and the non-stick quality failed! my eggs stick to the pan.
1,Tiny fry pan,This pan is a real conversation piece hanging on the wall in our kitchen. It might even work but that is not what we use it for.If it had a nice thick base we likely would have but it feels as well as looks like a toy. It certainly has been cost effective in the laughs it has generated so we will keep it.
2,Too small,"This is too small, I did not realize it would be this tiny when I got it. It looks like a toy, I ended up giving it to my daughter to play with."
4,Great Skillet!,Great little skillet that makes it easy to fry a great egg. If you follow the directions you will have a perfect egg.
2,"Worked fine for a couple of weeks, then got sticky","It's a real shame. I got this pan hoping to be able to fry an egg for my daily sandwich. Worked fine for about 2 weeks before my egg starting stick to the sides and the bottom. Don't know what happened. I normally cook my eggs starting off at moderately high, then low to medium. Buyer beware."
2,Just too small,"I bought this pan to fry single eggs, but it's just to small! Please be aware that even though this pan is advertised as being 4-3/4"", that measurement is across the top of the pan, which is completely irrelevant. It's infuriating when manufacturers do this, but anyway, the actual bottom of the pan (you know, where you cook) is only 3-3/4"". For me, that's simply too small for a fried egg. With a fried egg that small, I think the whites are too thick, giving it a strange texture and making it difficult for the whites to reach the proper level of doneness without overcooking the yolks. If the cooking surface were actually the advertised 4-3/4"", this would probably be a wonderful pan.And yes, it's fairly thin, flimsy, and cheap-feeling, but I'm not holding that against it and it doesn't contribute to my 2-star rating, because, well, it's a cheap pan! As a result, I used this once and it now collects dust in my cabinet; I'll stick to my larger nonstick frying pans."
3,grab a ruler before buying this item,"step 1: grab a ruler for this so you know what I am talking about.step 2: try not to laugh and think of yourself as the main character in Gulliver's Travels (a giant).Here are some measurements as reference: the top and widest part of pan measures 4.75"". the bottom portion resting upon a burner measures 3.75"". The handle extends 4.75"" from the pan. The smallest burner on our stove measures 6.5"" - this means that not only will the smallest burner heat up the pan, but it will also vertically heat up 1"" of the handle.Will this cook ONE egg? yes. Will this saute some garlic? yes. Will this melt some butter? yes.Can you put a lid on this pan? Let me consult my Barbie playhouse for one tiny enough to fit.It does appear heavy duty and well made, but I can't help but laugh why I bought such a tiny thing. oops."
2,Barely lasted 5 months,"The pan is just the right size, it doesn't tip over, and the handle never gets hot. Unfortunately, the nonstick coating just didn't last. We always use nonstick safe spatulas and wait for it to cool before hand-washing, so really not sure what went wrong. I know it is a really inexpensive pan, but it is never a good thing to notice that a bunch of the nonstick material has suddenly disappeared. Let's just hope it went down the drain and not in with the eggs."
2,"Cute, not too practical","I thought this would be great for making fried eggs, because when I make them in regular pans, they're never nice and circular. The problem with this pan is that it's impossible to flip the egg, so it always ends up like a mess. (Maybe if I had a tiny spatula...)"
1,ugh,This was the worse ever.. looked like a toy.. was certainly not worth the money.. even if it was not very much..
1,Use for LOW heat only,"There was nothing in the review about heat and when I checked the instructions, it said low heat only which is quite useless to me. I gave it away, not worth the return."
4,Very good,"I like this one egg wonder pan very much. It's easy to clean and perfect for just the one egg. However, be aware that it measures 4/34 inches across the TOP and so the bottom is even smaller. I blieve the ad could have been a little more clearer about whether the measurement was across the top or the bottom, as many pans are measured across the bottom. Therefore, I was slightly disappointed, but just slightly. All in all, I like it."
5,So cute!,"This looks like a toy in its size but the quality of the pan is surprisingly good. I have used it to cook an egg. Be aware that if you cook an egg, you may also need a spatula. A single egg is big enough to fill the entire pan. You will need to flip it to cook both sides. I use it when I'm in the mood for something light and small. I can also see using this for making small garnishes for main dishes. The pan cleans really easily and stores well. So far, I've used this a couple weeks. The pan has held up well. None of the coating has come off yet. I would buy this again if I had the opportunity or need."
2,Informative but confusing,"This book seems to have been completed before AutoCAD 2006 was completed so there are lots of typos and additional information that needs to be provided by a teacher if you are taking an AutoCAD class. This author also introduces the lessons in a confusing order - she'll ask you to do things that she hasn't yet explained in the book. Although some are confusing, most of the exorcises are informative and help you learn the program."
2,Bad reviews are right.,"I should have taken the reviews more seriously. It took a little too long to ship, I couldn't track it as promised and I couldn't reach anyone. The watch was ""on"" in the box and the battery died a week into wearing it. Not as thin as it seems either."
5,The Ancient Song,"If you are looking for one excellent collection of Celtic music for your library, then you have found it. This is music to both heal and inspire the soul. The blend of traditional instruments, human voice, and sounds from nature come close to perfection. If you close your eyes you can clearly see the various legendary themes covered:1) The Bard and the Warrior,2) The Dream of Taliesin,3) Tylwyth Teg,4) The Crossing,5) The Fortunate Isle,6) Lady Sovereignty,7) CuChulainn's Last Battle,8) The Raven Stone,9) Way of the Warrior,10) Isle of the Everliving,11) Ancient Song.A well-written and designed little booklet is included to retell the tales of Taliesin (the bard) and CuChulainn (the Warrior.) The tale of the Ancient Song is also included- of how the Celts of old believed that the world was upheld and sustained by a single all-embracing melody. After listening to this collection on a quiet evening, you will have no doubts that this is so."
2,nozzle leaks,It is a nice sprayer with brass fittings but I bought it to use Round Up the weed killer and it always leaks a couple drops from the nozzle end when you stop spraying. So it won't work at all for weed killers. If you are buying it to use with a different product it is a nice sprayer. I have bought Gilmour sprayers for years and never had a problem before
1,Horrible video,"I bought this video for my husband and it is the cheesiest, most awful DVD I have ever seen. It didn't teach you anything and had the most repetitive and 1980's graphics I have ever seen. A total waste of money...and we didn't have a lot to throw away on a complete failure of a video."
3,Not that great,This is an older product that has misinformation dispalyed it in. Some of the techniques he uses and explaines are out of date and can be considered dangerous. Not a great film for this day and age.
5,Charlie Rose and Michael Gambon,"I purchased this dvd primarily for the interview with Michael Gambon. I've seen him in so many movies in character rolls. I have been trying to get some of his movies as a young man, but have not been successful. When you see someone like him in a variety of roles, it's difficult to know what he is really like. I was pleased to know that he is not a bunbling old man but a very interesting man with a young outlook on life. I enjoyed the interview very much."
4,Gilmour Water Timer,I use this water timer for the pasture. It is very durable and doesn't leak. Very dependable I've been using this timer for two years now.
1,Does not work,"I bought three of these Gilmour Timers and three of the Nelson timers. This timer never switched off. All the nelson Timers worked, none of the Gilmour timers worked. I even swapped them around to see if it was the installation, water pressure or whatever and still these did not work. I returned them and ordered more of the Nelson Timers"
1,less than 1 star,"It does not shut off. I had the water on for hours when I had it set on 1 hour. I had two of them. One exploded. The other I just tossed in the trash, not even worthy of freecycle."
1,Does not work!,These timers do not last long and stop working. The company sent me replacements two separate times and they stopped working. I am on my third request for a replacement. Don't waste your money on this item.
3,"Works usually, gets stuck once in a while","I have been using this timer for about three years, and I always have a little apprehension when I use it because once in a while it won't shut off as set. Like the title says, it usually shuts off, albeit not exactly accurately. My advice is to find something else if you are in the market for one of these. I haven't thrown it out yet, but if gets stuck one or two more times, I'm done."
3,Casio keyboard,"This keyboard is very handy and can do more than I know how to do right now. What is definitely needed is a damper pedal, and I'm not sure if one is available for it. I haven't had time to contact Casio directly to find out if one is available. Otherwise, I'm happy with it."
4,Works great,Bought this as a gift and she has learned several songs quickly. It has many settings to help you learn. The only small problem I found was that the preloaded songs are not the whole song. I would recommend this to a beginner.
5,great product,I bought this as a replacement item for my travel trailerIt works great & is much nicer looking than the fractoryequipment.
5,Elite Grill,"I find this product to be very handy, size wise for a l person houshold..maybe even a two!!!Would recommend it"
2,Disorganized mess,"Holm may have been exceedingly knowledgeable about electrical contacts, but this book is a mess. It would appear that the manuscript was in loose-leaf form, someone threw it down the stairs, his widow reassembled it in random order, and thus it was published. I have never seen such a hopelessly disorganized technical textbook before. Holm jumps into discussing things midstream, then many chapters later (if lucky) you will find the introduction, definitions, etc. that might make it feasible to understand what he was earlier in the midst of.If you want to understand electrical contacts, read the book by Paul G. Slade, instead. This is more current and never was thrown down the stairs at all.For a more basic, but clear (not muddled!) introduction to the science of contacts, read the ""Ney Contact Manual"". This can be downloaded freely from the Ney company website, after you have filled out a request form."
3,Mount up!,This design is complicated and subject to wear rapidly. It does the job and has an interlocking feature for safety.
2,not helpful,"I'm an intermediate player, practicing Yang style since 1993.And I've read many taiji books,but my first reading has been unusually unhelpful.Sorry, but I won't try to reread any part of this book.The writer unveils a principle at a subtle level and then suddenly leaves the topic without fully explaining it fully. For example, he mentions a Double peng in Ward Off, and gives a verbal description which defies me and then says it is a sense of ""two events unfolding in step,"" ""like watching two different-sized cogs meshing in mutual rotation."" Duh!Definitely not recommended for beginners, and very confusing to the intermediate."
2,almost silly,"As a long time Taiji student/teacher I can vouch for the solid principles and concepts presented.However, the author's constant attempt to construct his prose in a magical, mystical package was almost too silly to read.he seemed kind of full of himself, as if he was the focus with his esoteric poetic sentence structure.It's worth getting just to enjoy his attemot to be deep, dark and authoritative."
4,Great Resource,"This is one of several books that we've purchased or borrowed from the library to learn about raising animals. I think that this one is one of the best (the Encyclopedia of Country Living is also another great resource). The information is straightforward and honest. After having experienced the country life, along with the ups and downs of having chickens, guineas, goats, and cows, I can say that I wish I had this one in the beginning."
4,Great Bean Recipes,"A simple little book, no frills or pictures, but surprisingly useful. Divided into four main categories--soups, salads, entrees, and sides--each recipe features beans, peas, and/or lentils. Many of the recipes are vegetarian/vegan, as well as some good recipes incorporating meat. The recipes aren't fancy or gourmet, but they're easy to prepare, healthy, and above all, quite tasty. If the book had pictures and a few exciting/unusual recipes for balance, I would give it five stars. Recommended for:--beginning cooks--busy/time-pressed cooks--anyone wanting or needing to incorporate more legumes into their diet"
1,These reviews are fake,"Since people have figured out a way to flood Amazon with positive reviews for their books, then you can't trust anything anymore. I saw that this book was generally favorably reviewed and decided to buy it. What a mistake! It is self-published garbage with tons of typos and embarrassing mistakes. The recipe that I did try was mediocre. It's a shame that people are so dishonest. Buy a book that was actually published by a real publisher, with pictures. Or just go online for your recipes, where I think, actually most of these recipes probably already are. Learn from my fail :-("
1,Not for Quick Lentils,"This review is only about the lentil recipes, which may or may not be your interest. When I bought Easy Beans, I was looking for varied ideas on cooking lentils, since they're healthy & quick: 20 minutes cooking. Easy Beans agrees in the overview on page 16, and then all but one of the lentil recipes take over 50 minutes. (Some bean recipes are faster, when they use canned beans.) Particularly disappointing when the subtitle promises ""Fast...recipes."" An alternative,Bean, Pea and Lentil Cookbook, is little better: most lentil recipes there take over 35 minutes."
3,testy yummy things,"easy cookbook to use,great recipes specially if you like beans and whole grains try it u like itthanks,"
2,boring,I felt this book had too many recipes for chickpeas and blackbeans. I would not recommend this book.
4,Great costume shoes!,I bought these shoes for my Halloween costume as a clown. They were awesome!My only complaint regards the size of the ankle openings. The openings are entirely too big. I had to wear another pair of shoes inside the clown shoes in order to keep them on my feet.
3,Eye Opening Look At Liberalism and Progressives,"If you find a lot of the current actions in Washington shocking and out of control then you haven't read the right history. This is a very dull and boring book and not particularly well written, however it is an eye opening book of insight.The man that wrote the book was an adviser and friend of FDR and right hand man to Woodrow Wilson. If you want to understand the mind of a Progressive, otherwords read modern day Liberal then you need to read this book.Always look to the past to understand your future. If you didn't know that Progressive believe that they are smarter than you and the free markets then this book will go a long way to explaining exactly what and how they think and what drives them and their ideologies."
1,Shame On You Amazon,"Shame on you Amazon. This book is availiible on public domain, as in, you can get it for free from Project Gutenberg. This is one of the most poorly written books of all time. Woodward Wilson was known to have read it 4 times."
3,Author has ego problems,"I am quite surprised this book has withstood the test of time so well. The author, Colonel House, was an advisor to then President Wilson. It was during Wilson's administration that Federal Reserve Bank came into being. It was on House's advice and strong recommendation that the Federal Reserve system was created. House, in this instance, saw himself as being the strong, benevolent leader to the sheep-like masses of people called Americans. Philip Dru, the book's main character, is House's idealized version of himself. He brings about a total change in American government, with himself in charge, after a ""second American Revolution"" of sorts has take place. The characters in this book are too pat, the situations are too pat to be believed. One does not really get ""acquainted"" with or sympathetic to the characters and situations in this book. The author has a very puffed up opinion of himself, and it SHOWS in his writing. Thank God this man never became President."
4,Todays Goverment,Although written so long ago it appears this is the goverment we have today and it isn't pretty. Congress denied and a benevelent? dictater
5,Love the book,I love the summery of the story and I'm collecting the whole series. So I can read them all over.
4,A funk holiday album by the string quartet jazz masters.,This is not a typical holiday album. By The Fireside has musical styles that run from Vivaldi's Four Seasons to a the folksy music of A Prairie Home Companion; with everything done in TISQ's unique way.
5,"Eclectic, enjoyable and eminently listenable","I've had this since last Christmas. All the tracks are good, but in particular I was tickled by ""Do Something Nice For Your Mother"", as narrated by Garrison Keillor. Make no mistake, this isn't exactly christmas party music -- it's best, as the title says, by the fireside."
4,Pretty Impressive,"I liked this collection a lot. My favorite piece was Near Northern where the rythym was good and the overall piece was excellent. The others were fairly good too, especially Snow What? Overall, I would say this was a nice collection to have."
3,Works good,"I bought this watch 8 years ago. It is kinda big but works good. I didn't have much chance to use it. I need to replace the battery two times in 8 years is about right. If I want to buy this type of watch again, I will buy one with solar power."
4,"It's a Trim Kit, not a Valve Kit.","Easy to think it might be a full kit, but the actual product title says exactly what it is: Trim Kit for Mixit Shower Valves.I needed to replace my old valve, which used the old style metal knob and temp lever. I only could easily find the Danco MX1 valve which fits the valve body, but is not compatible with the old metal lever and knob. I had to buy a Trim Kit with the more modern plastic knob and temp lever [still metal on the escutcheon.] All is good again. No more drippage.PRO-TIP - I couldn't get the old metal temp lever off to save my life. So, I tore it off, essentially. And found that there is a hidden-from-view screw that secures the lever. It's behind the long skinny part of the lever. So, put a screwdriver parallel to the wall, behind the lever, towards the center and you can then loosen the screw and avoid my rookie mistake."
2,Not the best,"I wasn't expecting much. Atleast it works but there is a small piece on the temperture handle that broke while installing this, so that when I turn the water off the handle moves with it."
3,Not All That Is Needed To Change Out Old Shower Valve.,"This did not come with all of the necessary parts to switch out an old shower valve. The product, itself, seemed to be nice. I had to return it, though, because it did not come with all of the necessary parts."
3,Not Terrible,Little mad you can only fit and wash 3big plates at a time in a normal size dishwasher!
1,Absolute garbage!,"Bought two of these sprayers, a two gallon and a three gallon. The top of the three gallon sprayer bottle was deformed (looked like it had been melted, probably happened during manufacturing, but how did it get by quality control?) and the top would not screw on tightly, so it would not build pressure. The two gallon sprayer wand handle fell apart in my hand after about five minutes of use, and when I attempted to depressurize the bottle with the pressure release valve, the valve collar came off in my hand. Both returned for refund."
2,Almost a good product,The brass wand is too heavy for the cheap plastic collar that holds it to the trigger section and when you wave it back and forth to spray it causes the collar to loosen and leak. If it had a more sturdy collar it would probably be OK
5,A MASTERPIECE COLLECTION OF HEAVY HEAVY FUNK!,"This is a collection of now out of print 45s issued by Desco Records. It is a great mix of soulfull vocals and upbeat, very danceable instrumentals. These are modern bands recorded in an analog style (I'm not 100% sure about that) so the sound is just like the pure funky sound of late 1960s/early 1970s rare groove and funk albums. This is really a bargain, considering the 45s sold for $6 each and all sold out in no time at all! Grab this stuff before it's out of print too! Thanks to Desco for keeping it true!"
2,Boring,"I decided to get the CD because it was said to be 'better than Wedding Planner', but I didn't think so. The main character played by Denise Richards is not well developed and the actress comes across very dull and lifeless in this movie, even when matched with Superman! It gets two stars however for the hot guys -- Dean Cain, ex Superman and the star from Sue Thomas, FBI Yannick Bisson, that plays his brother. HOT! HOT! HOT!"
5,"loved the movie,",I really loved this movie. I bought it because it had Dean Cain in it and it was a romance but I also got a second bonus because my favorite Yannick Bisson was also in it. I watch it at least twice a day. One can't look at Dean Cain to often. I bought 3 copies. 2 were Dvds and 1 was vhs.
1,Unpleasantly Suprised,"Save yourself, don't waste two hours that you can never get back. Dean Cain is still as good-looking as ever, but he can't surmount the horrible script, riddled with obvious chick-flick cliches. The movie only loosely (very loosely) follows the brief blurb written on the back of the dvd."
3,Good,"Came a little later than I expected. Although it came later, it is in good condition and I still give these people a good rating."
2,I've Seen Better,"This film was a let down for me. I was looking for an uplifting happy feeling in the end, but it was lost along the way. Not a film to set young children in front of. The plot got lost somewhere along the way. The Wedding Planner was a much better film if you are looking for a movie in this area. However, Dean Cain was as handsome as ever. And he plays a good guy. Not a man's movie at all."
4,Cute Romance,"I really liked Dean Cain, but I wasn't too thrill with Denise Richards and that annoying dog. It's a typical boy meets girl, they like each other then misunderstandings occur and instead of just comforting the person and talking them through, they jump to conclusion. However, it always seems to work out in the end and that's what makes me smile."
5,A great film,"I saw this first on comcast.net, then saw it about once a year thereafter, because I thought the actors were great.Since I love romantic films, I decided to purchase it for my own DVD library. I never get tired of it and it onlytakes a few months to forget all the details, so it is rewarding to watch it over again."
4,A Romantic Comedy with Twists,"A fun movie that starts slowly, builds speed, ends well and deals a few plot twists to keep you quessing.Denise Richards and Dean are fine as the two love interests that deal with mistaken identities, some crotchety, manipulative characters, and a cute actor dog.The story involves a junior wedding planner trying to get ahead with her demanding boss and get over a sour marriage- after a year and a half, she's still waiting for her cheating husband to sign the divorce papers. Dean Cain is a charming, sweet(or is he?) fireman whom she reluctantly falls for.This is Lifetime and not Hallmark with some non-family friendly themes including a love scene, you get to see Dean's bare back, but still pretty mild by today's standards, but really there's no language, nudity or violence."
2,"Nice, but not worth $130.00.","Don't get me wrong, this is a nice product but is it really worth all that money? For that price I was expecting much more. It has a canopy for the summer time to sheild the baby but come on, how often are you seriously going to have the baby outside in the summer on the ground? For that money I wouldn't want to put the boat on the ground? For me, it just isnt worth the money. There are much cheaper things out there that do the job just as well."
5,A Christmas CD with a difference!,"Vince Charles' ""Caribbean Christmas"" is a whole different flavor of Christmas music. Even though the songs are all classic holiday tunes, the truly amazing steel drum playing of this artist gives them a freshness I never would have expected. It has become my absolute favorite Christmas music CD!"
4,"Nice, but handles don't lock well","Great loppers with an excellent cutting ability. My only negative is the telescoping handles don't stay locked. They seem to unlock easy allowing the handles slide unexpectedly. Not deal breaker for how well the loppers cut, but it can be little annoying at times having to keep locking the handles in place."
1,Poor Quality,Purchased in April to use for hedge trimming at the end of summer. Used and on 7th cut the gear snapped on this lopper. All cuts were made at or under 1 1/4 inch. Forging on this product is poor and be aware that you need to stay below 1 inch to be safe. The extension on these becomes useless due to having to stay below the 1 inch mark.
4,A good book to begin your political education,The book is well balanced and well arranged topic-vise and offers a good number of real-world examples for the matters that are discussed in it. I recommend this book to everyone interested in understanding basic things about politics of the state and common political concepts we face in our everyday lives.
2,"Lots of information, poor organization","Currently using this text in a Political Science class. While it provides lots of information, it is very poor in developing a cohesive body of thought. The online outlines, summaries and test questions are helpful, so there are some useful tools but.............."
5,Tremendously Helpful,"This book was tremendously helpful. I saw my thoughts, fears, reactions, emotions, and myself in the first part of Harbin's discussion. So, I knew he was on to something. I kept reading, anticipating Harbin's strategies for dealing with, or solutions to, the problem of male anger. He did not disappoint. From his book I came up with a page of notes that I keep nearby to remind myself, e.g., to ""let it go"" and to ""to be fair to myself."" As a result of reading his book, I feel more at peace, happy, and confident than I have felt in years. Bravo!"
2,"long on wind, short on solutions","I bought this book in hopes of learning some good information in regards to anger management. While there was abundant anecdotal evidence, there was repetiveness and a lack of focus on solutions. When it did move into the solution portion, alot of it again floundered in anecdotes. I read the sections with an open mind, but did not recieve the level of information I had hoped for. I think this book is good for the man who wants to see that his concerns are legitimate, but for solutions, this book did not provide them adequately."
1,It wasn't the most helpful for me,"I've read quite a few books on anger in the last few months after having been confronted by two of the most significant folks in my life about it. The one turn-off I have toward ""angry men"" books is that it plays into the stereotype of men being more angry and violent. The latest studies seem to be disproving that assertion. Overall, the practical exercises in the book are helpful, however it didn't help me get to the root of my issue as other books and methods did. In the end, I set this book aside in favor of another methodology that yielded better results for me."
1,"Lots of hype, little help!","As dangerous as the power of anger is, it is a shame that this book sugar coats the issue. He doesn't tell how terrible men's actions are when we are under the influence of anger. The emotion anger provides us with so much power that it scares the hell out of women and children. This same anger used to hill beast in the forest. We see this same anger energy on football fields. Watch out for my book in two and a half years."
5,"The best book, the worst book..........","This was the worst book in that it made me take a long, hard look at myself. I did not like what I saw.It was the best book because the author gives you tips and techniques to manage your anger and, more importantly, why you feel anger all the time.Sadly, for me, it took the loss of a seven year relationship to wake me up.I highly recommend this book, don't wait till it is too late..."
4,Great Advice,I would recommend this book to anyone who does not know how to deal with their anger. It offers some very real advice and can give you insight from someone who has walked the same road.
4,Very Good book,"Very good and honest. Reaches unexpected depths of your problems. Helped me realize problems that I did not understand why they were taking place. I recommend this book to all who are suffering from ""anger""."
5,"great read, very helpful","I bought the book for my husband and so far he is very impressed by it. He said it hits many valid points about anger in men, and he highly recommends it for any man with an anger problem."
2,Ex Smoker,"I expected the author's experience with his own anger and his experience as a psychologist to yield a book with depth, perception and some sensitivity.Instead, I felt like I was listening to an ex-smoker.This is great book if you have never done any work on your anger and you are seeking an ""action-oriented"" approach to anger management.This is probably not a good book for you if you are also seeking a nuanced understanding of the underlying source of your anger. I am not a professional psychologist, so I won't comment on what I think that might be, but The Dance Of Anger (which is primarily for women) has a bit more depth and sensitivity and is quite relevant for men."
4,Can make immediate impact.,The fact that the author struggled with anger issues himself makes this a very credibl source for help. This book can have an immediate impact on your life and more importantly those that you love.
2,Obviously no science advisor,One of the poorest SF movies in terms of scientific accuracy. Moderately interesting actors. Very poor and low budget effects.
4,Snow Chasers Review,I thought this book was an inspirational book for young Christian readers. It shows God at work in the lives of people. I liked the story line of two young people and their journey of faith to save themselves and others from a flooding river. I like how they face and succeed in the challenge of sharing the good news of Jesus.
5,One of my favorite Christmas Albums!,"This CD came in the mail very quickly and it was in excellent condition even though it was used. It has ""The Little Drummer Boy"" featuring Bing Crosby and David Bowie- the most affordable way to get this one these days."
3,Hit and Miss,"The standout on this cd is the Waitresses ""Christmas Wrapping"", but most of the rest of the cd isn't so good. I was pretty disappointed actually, since other reviews of the cd looked good, and I generally like most of the artists on this cd. This will not be one of my holiday standbys."
3,Could Be Better,"Except for the selections by Kate Bush, The Smithereens, The Payolas and The Pogues, all the other cuts on this cd can be found on several other rock and pop Christmas collections. Best cut is ""Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer"" by The Smithereens, they even sound like the Drifters during the opening sequence,right down to the organ riff. Otherwise, this would be much better with different tunes by different artists."
5,"All plays are meant to be seen, not read.","There is a review here about this play being better to see than to read. This should be true of all plays, since that's their purpose. In fact, if you really enjoy reading a play, in the same exact way you enjoy reading a novel- it very likely may not be a good play & should in fact be a novel instead.Having said that, I believe Anna in the Tropics is a great and beautiful play. Reading it I can see how wonderful it would be to see on the stage; watching these very real characters go through their vulnerable journeys; I enjoyed my copy thoroughly."
3,A Bit Predictable and Formulaic With A Few Good Moments,"I haven't seen a production of this play, so I'm judging only by the quality of the text on the page. As stated by a few other reviewers here, the play is just very predictable. Characters are narrowly drawn and perform like puppets used by the playwright to make a point about how the world is about to change from one that is warm and vital to one that is harsh and mechanized. Not exactly breaking new ground here, so it's odd the play earned a Pulitzer Prize. Maybe the production adds nuances that the written text just doesn't have (a good director can make even modest material come alive.) This play felt contrived and agenda-driven, not in a hugely in-your-face way, but more in a piece-of-fluff way. I can't imagine it surprised the author as he was writing it - which isn't good - and it probably won't surprise anyone reading it. It's old news and a bit tired."
3,"A nice read, better to be seen","I was quite excited to read this play after hearing the playwright speak and read excerpts from it. However, I found out that this is a play better suited to be seen than read. Reading it cannot possibly capture the rhythm of the Cuban characters speech that Cruz has aptly recreated. [I should know, as I live in Miami] Cruz had done a lot of research on Ybor City, but it seemed to not come through as vividly as one might think. [I've been to the charming little city] Sure, one could easily find historical data that points to the lectors and Cuban cigar makers: but that is information easily found and known. Still, there are lines that are just plain beautiful and make the reader stop and say ""Hmmm..."" But in this writer's opinion, Cruz' ""Beauty of the Father"" is much more poetic, deeper, and beautiful. Maybe the Pulitzer should have gone to that one."
3,Hot blooded Latins,"Tolstoy's Anna Karenina isn't a book that you would usually think of peoplegetting really passionate about. The cigar factory becomes a place wherepeople have issues about love and it is centered around a handsomereader of books. The explosion is a while building and when it happens,you knew something was on the way...It is well written play, but I really don't like it very well.Maybe that is a good thing?"
1,Where'd the dvds go?......,"So I bought this dvd as ""new""..... yeah, when I received it, it was completely sealed up but the dvds were non-existent when I opened it up. ZERO DVDs inside. So I paid for an empty dvd case. Depressing :("
3,NASCAR Brakes???,"Pads came with new hardware. The hardware did not fit my vehicle even though it said it was the exact fit for my make and model. Thankfully I saved the old hardware. 3 of the 4 pads had at least one of the wear indicators missing or just never installed. They are permanently attached so I couldn't have dropped them. Plus they were not consistent. One pad's wear indicator may have been on the left, one on the right, and one pad had them on both sides. Not a problem but makes me wonder about quality. I've had the pads installed for two weeks now with new rotors. There is still a heck of a lot of brake dust generated. That was the number 1 reason for me to change the brakes and buy a name brand brake that I thought was reputable. Next time I'll go with Wagner."
2,Didn't work for me....,Afraid that the callus remover didn't do anything for me. Perhaps it only works with small callus's.
4,I bought them as gifts,I have a collection of Riedel glasses. Still waiting for the second half of my order. Just got half the order. Hope it arrives so as it was a gift.
3,Could use a little tweaking,"It's nice to have something beside the standard issue plastic snap-in holder, but this leather case needs a little better fitting done. Everything seems just a little off and I find I have to slide the cover to one side or the other to get my bb to turn off. So that tells me the magnet doesn't quite match up correctly. If I press too hard on the cover when I close it, it will launch the phone. I've learned to deal with these little annoyances because I haven't found anything better. But Krusell needs to do a little tune up on their next batch."
2,The case is not cut right for 8700c,"While I was happy with my previous Krussel case for Blackberry 7250, this is just too off. In fact is so off that Krussel website doesn't advertise this product, I suspect it must be on recall or something, since it's not usuable at all !"
1,Don't waste your money,There are a lot of beautiful Christmas CD's out there. This is not one of them. Don't waste your money.
5,An Elegant Collection of Traditional Carols,This is a beautiful and moving collection of instrumentals. I purchased it last season and find that it is now one of my favorites. It is perfect as background music for a holiday gathering but also wonderful for focused listening.
4,Christmas music,"Music is pretty. The last song skips, oh well....it was a library copy. I have to write 3 more words."
4,Lisa Lisa Lisa,"This was quite a bit better than I was expecting. I watched it because it featured Cheryl Ladd who I am a fan of from watching Charlie's Angels.She is wonderful in this. It's not like quite a lot of the TV Movies, a American family drama, sometimes with other actresses from Charlie's Angels.It is quite a lot different. It kept me interested right up till the end, trying to find out who the person now after Lisa really is. A better TV Movie with great acting from all really."
2,nothing beyond mildly entertaining,"cheese made for tv crap, but if there is nothing else on, I guess its not the worst way you can waste your time."
1,Not Worth the Price....,"This book would have made a fine short story. For the first 16 pages -the suspense is breathtaking. Then the story becomes sodden with unbelievable actions and motives. The characaters are not well-formed. It goes downhill in a bucket as the action becomes repetitive and confusing. I closed the book at page 113. I snuck a look at the last page, p.190, but did not find resolution."
5,Luv Windham Hill,Have a number of these Windham Hill collections. This one like most of the others won't disappoint.
1,"""T H I S"" IS AWFUL!!!","What a piece of garbage...A Musicians worst nightmare come true.A pipe dream of a midget man tryingto be someone he'll never be!!!Give it up and get a DAY JOB!!Signed,Not-a-Fan!"
1,Sorry but not Bowie.,"Maybe one good song on this album I bet the artist wrote the review below this one because this music does not even equal Bowie, and who is that other guy who played on the album? Too obscure...I don't know..buy Low or The orb's Orbus Terrarum and take those trips instead. Peace"
3,HTC HD2 case,"Not the best case for the phone but the only one I found online (hard case). I don't like carrying my phone in my pocket so it works for now. It just makes the phone look even bigger than it is. If you can wait, I say wait for something slimmer with a snug fit. The phone actually doesn't touch the front side of the case - a little to big."
3,Good Tidings Prelit Christmas garland,"The Garland looks fairly realistic, the clear lights are pretty and it is suitable for a banister. It is somewhat stiff however which makes it difficult to work with."
1,Broken,"The item arrived already open, both the box and the discs. I've tried repeatedly to install them and they are not working. I've contacted customer service over the phone and email and have had no response to sending them back."
2,"Poor software - buggy, crashes often","They list this software as Vista compatible. Their vision of compatible is the software runs 10 minutes then crashes - if you can finish all your work in 10 minutes, you'll be fine.The drawing tools are weak, doing a simple 45 degree bend in a kitchen island is impossible. Doing something simple like putting a sink where you want it on a countertop is impossible - it always centers the sink in the space provided. If you're used to even the drawing tools in MS Powerpoint, this will be a big disappointment."
1,Waste of money....,"You think if the software could do all the great things it says so easily, then a garage shouldn't be so hard, right? The simplest things like getting it to print right, laying out joist, wall height...pain in the... If you have never touched a tape measure or hammer and want to play pretend architect you might have found what you need. I recommend anyone with knowledge of construction, CAD, or decent software steer clear - it will only confuse and frustrate you - I though since it was created by Chief Architect it would have been worth a ****."
2,Forget modeling a split-level house,"I First realized that the product was limited when browsing the 100 or so samples that come with the product I saw there were NO split-level samples to use as a basis for modeling our existing home. After 4 hours of tweaking with floor levels, wall heights and unintuitive invisble walls, I was able to get something resembling our existing 3BR split-level, but it's off enough that my wife and I will not be able to get the kind of visualization we expected.Invisible walls allowed me to approximate our multi-sloped roof, but the result is not very satisying for all the effort.On the other hand, if NOT trying to model a split-level, it is very easy to use, almost trivial, to pop out a model from a floor plan and the renderings look very nice.Bottom line: I wish I had seen the reviews and known the BIG limitation before I bought the product from Sam's Club."
3,Decent consumer home layout and visualizing software,"Of course when you buy these kinds of programs, unless you go with the high end versions you will never get what you are hoping for - but in the case of Better Homes and gardens Home Designer Suite 7.0, you get a decent enough tool that works well enough.I was hoping for better texturing, better overall visuals, a better library of furniture and fixtures, etc. But this suite will do its job in helping you visualize the layout of your home, or for a remodel.The program is not the cleanest to use, and can be frustrating at times - but I have not used too many design programs (including AutoCAD) that are not frustrating at least at times.So in closing, this product is ok but don't expect it to be picture perfect or to be too flexible."
3,"Good functionality, poor selection in libraries","As far as using the product to draw in the walls of my basement (I am planning a basement remodel), I was very happy and found the tool easy to use and the tutorials quick to get you started. The issue I have is in the poor selection of accessories, furniture and appliances that come with the product. No doubt that is the price differential between the different packages. Could I draw a plan view of my proposed basement with interior walls, doors and windows? Yes. Would I be able to submit that to my village for the permit application? Yes. Would it have been nice to have a bigger selection of accessories (bar counter, stools, home theater seating) to get a more realistic walk-through view of the proposed living space? Sadly, yes. But I accomplished what I set out to do, now my wife will have to wait and see what it really looks like finished."
4,Hours of fun,"I bought this product for my wife to use to start the design of our new home. She's a regular computer user, but no kind of geek and is frequently confused by software features and functions.Nevertheless, she's spent hours enjoying the process of designing our house using the software. Room layouts and adding furniture have been a breeze. The software has given us a very good picture of how big the rooms need to be and how the furniture will fit.She's had some trouble figuring out mutliple floors. When she added the basement and then switched to a 3D view, the house was shoved sideways off the basement. We never figured that out. Adding stairs to the second floor is another function that she also hasn't quite figured out.But overall we are enormously pleased with the software. It gives us plenty of design power without overwhelming us with complexity."
2,Deport this Import,"This disc is only $9.99, but don't buy it. Save your money. If you can find another Shangri-Las compilation similar, do so. The selection of songs are great. On the contrary, thumbs down for the audio quality. It is awful. It sounds like someone burned a CD from old vinyl. ""Give Him a Great Big Kiss"" has a ding in it (must have been a skip in the record!!). It's a shame that such great material was produced so inadequately."
2,Greatest Hits???,"There is a lot of material on this cd. However, some of it could have been omitted: The Boy, Dressed in Black,Wishing Well,Hate To Say I Told You So,Bull-Dog. It is easy enough to skip over the misses and just listen to the hits. The biggest disappointment is the overall sound quality--horrible. The old Red Bird and Mercury vinyl LPs that I own sound much better. There is a glitch in the beginning of Give Him a Great Big Kiss that just startles your ears. The liner notes contain some inacurate information--for one thing, Marge Ganser died from cancer not a drug overdose. This album only gets 2 stars because it does have my favorites--guess I'll just play the old vinyl though."
3,Great product for the price,Printer was easy to set up and came with 1 sample ink cartridge to start with. I have no complaints. Nice basic unit.
1,Warning!!! No USB cable or black printer cartridge included!,"I fell for the low price and was sure that I somehow lost the USB cable and tore my study apart looking for it. I finally gave up and went on line to buy a cable. I then stumbled upon these reviews and after then checked my printer instructions and sure enough, no USB cable is included and no black printer cartridge. Locally, the cable will cost $35 with tax. Then you still have to buy the black printer cartridge. Bad, bad Amazon for not warning buyers that the price does not include the printer cable and black ink cartridge! I am very disappointed in Amazon."
3,Wish I had read the other reviews before purchase,Misleading advertising. The USB connect cable costs 25.00 plus. I have never purchased a printer that did not come with a connect cable. Wish I had read THE REVIEWS FIRST..I would have known this was a cheap come on printer.
3,decent printer for the price,"I guess for 50 bucks you can't expect too much from it. The problem with it is that it'll load up 4 to 5 pieces of paper and it'll get jammed up. Aside from that, it's pretty quiet. If I were you, I would just spend the extra money to get an all in one machine."
1,Ugh.,"It's just wonderful spending your day shopping, thinking you have everything. You get home all excited to install your new printer.. only to find there is no black cartridge or USB cord. Also the ink runs out very quickly, I think I have only printed a maximum of 30 pages before it ran out.Thanks HP."
1,"no cable, no black ink cartridge, no quality","The lack of a USB cable didn't bother me, I still had my old one from my last printer.I was surprised to find no black ink cartridge, but what bothers me the most is the lack of quality in the prints and design. It uses a ton of ink and jams frequently, the ink cartridges are designed to be nonrefillable.This was my first hp and it will be my last."
1,Piece of Crap!,"I bought one of these last Spring 2007 after returning back from Ireland and I have just smashed the thing on the floor after it continuously kept rolling the paper through halfway and getting stuck and not printing and then....ugghh! Don't buy it. I have three cartridges left and so I have to get another one of these but after a HP printer going the same way in Ireland I bought a Canon over in Dublin and it was fantastic, however because the power supply is different I gave to my brother in law and thought that I would give HP another try. Well, after just 8 months of owning the thing it just up and did itself in...so I helped to put it out of its misery."
3,Does what its supposed to,"It looked great on the computer screen but when I received it there was a cheap feeling about it. Having said that, it does print and it hasn't given any problems since."
1,Beware: You will have to factor in the USB and Black Ink Cost,Nowhere in the product description did they mentioned that the USB cable and the black ink cartridge were not included. That is at least an extra $25 you will need to factor into the total cost.
4,Exactly As Promised,"This printer is exactly what I was looking for!!! Not too expensive, but it does the job perfectly! Don't get it if you're looking for amazing quality, high-capacity, specialty printing, etc. This is a great printer for regular home printing. It is pretty small, so it fits great anywhere, and it only uses two cartridges. So far, I haven't had any issues with it, and I've printed a lot of different things. Color and black-and-white...not a speed demon, but fast enough. I would give it 5-stars, but we're not talking the holy grail of printers here. If you need something simple to get the job done, definitely get this model!"
3,meh,"it has great print quality and it's really simple and cheap but the problem is that it runs out of ink really, really quickly so it's probably not worth it."
3,good price---but got higher when I got it,"hp deskjet D2330 printer. A good price at 40 bucks. Free shipping--always a plus. Timely received. Works great, What's the problem. Instructions say UBS cord may or MAY NOT be included. Of cource, it was not included. Add 10 dollars. Contained a color cartridge but no black cartridge. Add 10 dollars. My 40 dollar good price is now a 60 sad price."
5,Simple and efficient,"This printer is exactly what I needed. Reasonable price tag, inexpensive ink replacement and great quality print."
3,Nothing Fancy,"I've been using this printer for several years. I bought it because it was the cheapest one at the store (around $30), and I just needed something to print text.I can say with confidence, that it prints text. I have also had no technical problems with it at all, as it is very simple. It's also light, and doesn't take up a lot of desk space.It will print color images, but not well, and it will blow through a ton of ink doing it. The D2330 is not cost effective if you want to print a bunch of pictures.This printer serves my purpose. I'll replace it when it breaks."
5,Dan's printer,This printer is very basic but exactly what we needed for our son. The transaction was seamless. The printer was inexpensive and was shipped quickly and without a hitch. I am very pleased.
4,Good little printer,"After reading the reviews I decided to try it. So far, no pages are jamming up. The printer cartridge is small and, will have to be replaced frequently if used intensively. You'll have to check online for best prices for replacements. Also, its true about the lack of a black print cartridge. Mine came with a single tricolor cartridge.Other than this info, I've no problems."
4,cheap printer,"prints good, - there that is my review - now stop sending me emails requesting that I write one"
3,essentails of business ethics,i'd like to review some aspects of business ethics written by theese 2 writers. It's so important to understand the area of ethical issues in my class.
1,No Longer supported,"This product, along with Vip C is no longer being supported. I recommend that Mac users looking for a BASIC programming package try REALBasic, or Future Basic. Codewarrior Discovery is also a good choice."
5,For anyone who wants to add tension,"This book goes beyond erotic romance and is, I think, a gem for anyone who wants to write romance of any sort. The exercises are great. Most of the topics worth thinking about even if your stories never gets beyond the bedroom door. It's all about the TENSION.I got a lot out of it, but I wish this book had been around a few years ago when I was a newbie writer."
2,Surprisingly disappointing high tech speakers,"After reading many positive reviews from people such as Chris Breen and in particular learning about the features for wireless configurations, I started out with a positive disposition toward the Audioengine A5. The design and technical functionality immediately give one the impression that this company knows what its doing.Thus, the shock is even greater when one has the first listen. Sound is certainly subjective, but the A5's interpretation is flat overall and sometimes distorted. Although the A5's provide a healthy low bass, the high range isn't crisp and the mid range is sometimes distorted. It could well depend on the type of music. Whereas Led Zeppelin sounds pretty good, other types of music such as Jazz or Classical leave much to be desired. In short, my opinion is that the A5's aren't a viable selection for anyone with an ear for a broad range of music. If you are considering the A5's, please give them a thorough testing first."
2,loud hum/buzzing,"OK sound but couldn't get rid of the loud hum/buzzing noise. I followed all the troubleshooting tips in the manual and bought a ground loop isolator from RadioShack. Still no luck. I saw many people complaining about the same problem on the internet. None seemed able to solve the problem, so I sent them back. Then I got some Prodipe 8 monitors that work perfectly with my Airport Express in the same location, have much better sound and absolutely no hum. They were also cheaper than the Audioengine 5. They are quite a bit bigger, but if you're worried about the size you could get the smaller Prodipe 5."
2,Speakers died after about 1 year,"As others attested in reviews that convinced me to buy these speakers from Audioengine, they sound great. Unfortunately, after about a year the left channel sound output died and I've been unable to troubleshoot it. The left speaker just puts out a muffled distorted cacophony of noise. Tried connecting a different speaker to isolate the source and it also played with extreme muffled distortion so I suspect something is fried in the amp. Eventually I'll get around to taking it to a local repair shop, but I'm sure the repair cost will be high. It's frustrating because these were quite expensive and I've never had speakers die before."
5,Grown up speakers,"Firstly - I have been using Amazon for years and leave no reviews. This speakers have forced me.Secondly - as a frustrated audiophile tinkering for years and steering clear of 'small' speakers the idea of wireless tempted me with a pair of these. My previous encounters with Sonos were too cumbersome and prone to dropouts and trouble and strife. Anyway, once the source and signal are true for these puppies they perform miracles for their size. And I have yet to find / be given permission to find the max volume in a large apartment - they have more than enough oomph. Well done, very pleased."
5,Awesome speakers,"I needed some great speakers, I used to have a 5.1 Logitech desktop speakers and my cousin has the Bose sound dock series II. The overall sound quality is way better than the logitech not as much bass because the logitech has a sub with volume knob, don't get me wrong though the audioengine's do have some punch. Sound quality vs Bose sounddock. The Bose sounds a little bit clearer but the audio engine's have a little more bass and they're stereo.The sound quality is very good on the audio engine's I've heard some things I couldn't hear in the music before.I got the white one's and the finish is really nice."
5,Unbelievable sound !,"These speakers are truly a work of art - the sound is unbelievable for their size. I am a music lover and enjoy hearing all the complexities of the music without distortions. We use them with the Squeezebox set-up. Hats off to the folks at AudioEngine !! - they went beyond expectations. We just purchased the smaller versions for a PC set-up...again, we are very pleased."
5,A fine biography,"Michael Yorke has written a gem about a fine illustrator and storyteller. Mervyn Peake's considerable influence on fantasy fiction (through his neo-Gothic trilogy, Gormenghast) and portfolio of illustrations cement his reputation of a master of twentieth-century arts and letters. Yorke's coverage of his debilitating illness is highly sympathetic, but the biographer does not shy from Peake's darker side, including infidelity to his wife. This finely-produced book contains a generous sampling of Peake's writings and illustrations. Well-researched and superbly written."
2,Disappointing,"A little known german opera. Interesting plot and historical recording. I came to this mainly because of Anna Tomowa-Sintow, and, surprise surprise: the cd does not contain the libretto!!! Really bad. Anyone interested should beware."
2,Larry Niven writes a good yarn but sees women as plastic toy,"Larry Niven does an interesting job of creating a world of inventive beings--intelligent life forms evolved from cats rather than apes. The Kzinti males are intelligent but the females are not sentient. And that's the way every female character is basically portrayed, though the human women are allowed to walk, talk and interact with men."
3,Mrrr.,"The world created is a wonderful sandbox. Having read a sample from 'The Children's Hour', I bought this, thinking it would be in it. Unfortunately, it is not. I was about to fling the book across the room when I came to the third story, 'Cathouse', which made up for the entirety of the rest of the book by far. I'd buy it just for that one story...but only expect that one story to be worth your time, unless you REALLY like dry, dead, old sci-fi."
1,Beware!!!,"Not only is the display way too bright to sleep in (even on the low setting), you can only see the display- when lying down- with something under the back of the unit to prop it up. To add insult to injury, I received this as a gift from bed, bath and beyond and had to return it 3 times because it would inexplicably reset itself to 6:00 P.M. and stay there until I adjustied it. Do not waste you time or money!"
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"I have owned this product for 5 months. The problems pointed out by other reviewers are all true. Extremely poor radio reception. The time is impossible to read unless you are looking at it straight on. Buttons are poorly placed. You must reach around the back and feel for multiple tiny buttons just to turn the alarm on or off. Controlling the ipod through the docking system is awkward. Sound quality is poor. To top it all off, mine just stopped working and it appears I have no recourse through Amazon. Save your money. There are better choices out there."
2,Innacurate alarm,"I was quite pleased with this alarm clock until recently when I found that it was consistently waking me up one hour early. I tried fiddling with the DST setting and then changing the alarm and clock times just a little but without fail it would wake me an hour earlier than I wanted. The brightness may be a problem for some people but I found it reasonable. Overall a good docking station, but a poor alarm clock."
2,Needs some more development...,"I received this for Christmas and right away noticed a problem. When you turn on any of the audio options (sounds, iPod, radio) you get a very faint, high pitched tone occurring at any volume level above 0. I returned the unit and got another and had the same thing. I'm just going to deal with it since it's the only one I've found that has the iPod dock, dual alarm, and time projection. Also, it will NOT charge the iPod Touch 2G. Both units prompted a message on my iPod that charging was not supported with that device. Oh, and the iPod Touch 2G doesn't sit real secure in the dock. I wouldn't buy this again. And after reading the other reviews, I'm now a little leery of the resetting, and power failures..."
1,IPod Nano 4th Generation Incompatible,"Short and plain, Homedics produces great alarm clocks, but this won't charge a 4th generation IPod Nano."
4,Nice alarm clock,"My wife loves the beach sounds and all of the nature sounds are realistic, the radio is a little bass heavy, and there is no tone adjustment. It works great with an iPod, but will not charge an iPhone 3g. The time projected on the ceiling is clear and easy to read at night."
5,Good sound quality,"I am extremely satisfied with this product. The sound quality is very nice. Also, the option to set a timer to turn off the audio comes in handy quite often."
3,Slow Clocks,"I bought two, and I would love them except for two problems.1. The clocks run slow, losing several minutes over the course of a month.2. AM radio reception is poor for my favorite station. A cheap battery-powered AM radio placed on the nighstand next to it sounds much better."
3,Plain and simple - it's too bright,"Everything I like about this (that it has an Aux port, that is has a projector, that it's relatively small and pretty, and that it has NatureSounds) I have to take back for one simple reason:The clock is just too bright, even on its dimmest setting. I find that more nights than not we cover the display with a book or whatever's available because it's just that bright. And don't get me wrong - our room isn't exactly pitch black...Oh, and don't even bother using the projector (which is the reason I chose this model). even at IT'S dimmest setting (of two) it's as bright as trying to sleep outside under a full moon. It's a strange feeling waking up in the middle of the night and seeing everything around you as though it were the middle of the day, not to mention trying to fall asleep.If you honestly like sleeping in full light, this is the clock/iPod doc for you. If not, move along."
1,A total piece of garbage. Don't waste your money on this one.,"The big complaint about this alarm clock is that we cannot see the time unless the room is pitch black. It is nearly impossible to see the blue numbers when there is any sort of light in the room. The other complaint is that the projector (which also displays the time only in 0 light situations) does not move around very well despite it being made to. It points straight up which gives you an upside down image of the time on the ceiling. You would think that the maker would think to allow the projector to spin completely so the numbers would face the other direction. Unfortunately, the spinning rotation stops before you can completely rotate the time projection. Last, I had to purchase the remote separately. This alarm clock is garbage."
3,Very Bright Display,"I was excited when I was able to purchase this at a discount, because I wanted a projection clock and this had the added benefit of the ipod function. My husband liked falling asleep to the nature sounds. My complaint lies with the display.My kids have a projection clock that subtly projects the time on the ceiling. I always loved this especially on those nights when they were sick and I had to comfort them in their own bed and could easily see the time on the ceiling. With this clock though, the display is huge and brightens up the room--very annoying for me because I like to sleep in total darkness. The projection display is light blue and the light blue light also streams out from around the ipod when it is docked. The light eminating from the clock is almost obnoxious and I ended up sleeping with a pillow over my head until I returned it."
1,Not so good,The display is too big and bright.To further this the iPOD dock lights up as well.There are no radio presets.The radio reception is poor.There are no tone controls.Too expensive.Look for something else.
3,Display is way too bright,"This clock would be PERFECT if it weren't for the display. Even with the Dim setting on LO it lights up a room. I had to throw a cloth over it to get to sleep. Would probably be great for a kids room. All of the other features are great, nature sounds, radio works great, iPod sounded fantastic. I'm really disappointed that I have to take it back."
3,Too lit up,"A nice clock radio with an ipod dock, but it is so lit up at night it's like having the light on. There are only 2 settings for the light, and the low one is not nearly low enough. It is not only the clock face that is lit up, but the whole ipod dock and several buttons. I am returning this product."
2,iPod Nano 2nd Gen - won't fit,"This unit sounds ok. And the sound-spa aspect is a nice difference. However, none of the inserts that come with it fit the ""new"" iPod Nano. I'm still waiting to hear from Homedics about getting an insert that fits..."
2,not bright enough,"I replaced the older style round HOmedics projection clock with this one to get the ipod feature. This clock is placed across the room on a dresser and from the bed it is not readable, even during nightime, same with the projection feature You just don't know what time it is unless right in front of it. And yes, I have it on the high light level. Never had this problem with the older, simpler Homedics. Features on it are fine, no problem with the time or alarm system, but if you can't read it, it is no fun waking up in middle of the night and wondering what time it is. Nope, I won't move it next to the bed, instead, it will be replaced and moved somewhere else."
4,Soothing,Yes the radio reception is not so hot but that wasn't what I bought it for anyway. Great with my nano and the ocean waves are perfect to fall asleep to.
1,"Poor Time Display, Hard to set Alarms","Got this and both my husband and myself were severely disappointed.Sound quality is great.Yet unless you are right on the clock you cannot see the time on the front display (the projection works...if it is night time or dark in your room)I owned it for 3 months and never set the alarm on it short of a couple of times. Very difficult to set and change, plus turning it off is a pain and a half. I finally settles on a iHome with dual alarms...My husband and I are much happier now.Don't waste your money on this.We got it at a major discount and we couldn't wait to get something else that was more expensive.Never used the nature sounds since the rest of it was so hard to work.OH...both my husband and I are geeks, so it was due to bad design that we didn't set the alarms too often. Not due to us, we can admit when we are idiots. ;-)"
3,my rating,over all this product proformes as advertised however it is lacking in some qualitys that would have been an easy add on there is no alarm volume and the level I go to sleep with is the level that the alarm wakes up with and the bass has a little to be desired but over all the product works as advertised.
2,Defective,"I got this for X-mas plugged it in and the sound was great then I attached my ipod and the volume stopped working, I disconnected it and then unpluged the system. Now when I plug it in it emits a high pitched sqeaking and will not turn on."
2,Caution! Doesnt work with I -Touch 2nd Gen,"My mom and I each received this as a gift for Easter and were extreamly excited about them. All the information on the box and the website says it works with I-Pods and I-Touch. A word of warning, the charging function DOES NOT work with the I-Touch 2nd gen. We are returning ours today."
1,Broke within days,It was working ok for a couple of days and then then 'spa' sounds became overrun with static and the next day all of the lights stopped working. Seems like it's not an uncommon issue with this company so I plan on avoiding this brand going forward.
2,TOO BRIGHT!,"I have had 2 different Homedics clocks, and they should give their audio people a big raise--the sounds are fantastic. The rest of the team should be fired. This clock is TOO BRIGHT! Even the power light is a beacon. I had to put nail polish on the power light, and black electrical tape over the clock portion.PLEASE: 1) Make the clock red instead of blue. The blue is hard to see. 2) Put a dimmer that has a dial. These are insanely bright. 3) Sell your audio on iTunes. I would buy it in a minute and use my regular iPod speaker to listen to the sounds-this way I don't have to deal with the overbrightness of the clock."
1,AM reception horrible,"This unit is fine for the nature sounds and the ipod docking/playing. However, I cannot pick up even a single AM station. I purchased it so that I could flip between radio and ipod and either I have to replace it with something else or I have to have 2 radios on my desk. My $10 tiny portable radio picks up stations, so why can't this? I am tired of clock radios always having the flimsy antennae and no reception."
5,Very dusty break in but stop on a dime.,These things produced a lot of dust when I first installed them but stop the car a lot better than the stock pads. Would definitely advise slotted rotors to go with them. They are on my 2007 Dodge Magnum RT which is heavy. I would highly recommend these brakes.
5,Darling S & P Set!,This is a really cute Salt and Pepper set for dog lovers! They make a set for most dog breeds and they are all very cute. They are a real conversation starter too! Linda
3,What if all the men are gone?,"This is a speculative fiction set in the future - a future where there are only female humans left surviving. In essence - a new form of birth control had disrupted the ability of women to have male children - until there are no males born at all - only females. Only the process 'parthenogenisis' - the development of an unfertilized female egg allows humanity to continue - but this only produces other females.The author outlines his vision of a future with no men - and how society might look. This is a very interesting take - and somewhat more graphic than Ursula LeGuinn's 'Left Hand Of Darkness'. Eventually, a frozen male body is found in the far future, and the chaos that ensues from the possible re-introduction of males into society ensues.Be forewarned - there are some rather graphic forced sex scenes in this book."
3,Tool for beginner level system managers,"This book was a great help for me as a programmer trying to become a system manager for Vms (a new operating system for me). It gave me the bare basics I would need to know inorder to get to a good start learning vms. This book is not for an advanced systems administrator, but it is just right for a beginner. The chapter on system integrity monitoring was really good. It talks about the uses for the monitor command. It also talks about monitoring the system for hardware errors. The book contains very little on tcp/ip and its uses in the vms realm."
2,Sometimes useless,"I use this book from time to time. I work with quite a few different models of VAX and AlphaServer machines. The first part of Appendix C has many of the commands necessary to boot VMS with various options -- but not all of them.The book is incredibly dated, too. While it has most VAX models, which went out of production 15 years ago, it doesn't have all the Alpha models. And the boot commands for Alpha are buried in the middle of the text instead of being included in the Appendix. Fortunately, all Alphas use the same boot commands.This book doesn't include the HP Integrity servers (which replaced Alpha), which has a much more complex boot process. Of course, this book was written way before those servers were invented.I'm hoping that the new book (OpenVMS System Management Guide (HP Technologies)) might be more up-to-date.OpenVMS System Management Guide (HP Technologies). I'll be checking it out soon."
5,Something for any serious student of Ancient Greek,"I got the 1956 edition already knowing that it would be very useful, as I've used the library's copy on many occasions. As a graduate student, I thought it was finally time to invest in my own. The text is crisp, and it's bound attractively. After several conversations with professors, I settled with this over more modern editions, because nothing that has come out since has been able to match Smyth's, in terms of completeness, accuracy, and utility. The one thing I'd say against this particular edition, is that the spine broke down the middle almost instantly after opening it (I'm quite protective over my books), but I can only attribute that to the book's thickness.Warning: The other hardback edition in this series (the more recent publication) is just a shoddy reprint of the original Smyth's, not the better 1956 edition. Do not purchase it; I made that mistake, and had to send it back."
1,This is not the book you are looking for.,"I purchased the Benediction Classics edition thinking I was simply getting a cheaper and lighter version of the hardcover Smyth's Greek grammar. I quickly discovered, however, that I was mistaken - this is not Smyth's classical work ""Greek Grammar"" but another of his earlier, shorter works misleadingly titled. This version is hundreds of pages and thousands of sections shorter than the real ""Greek Grammar"". Worst of all, if you are a student of Greek trying to look up the citations made to Smyth in a student commentary or scholarly article, the sections you have do not match the numbers that all experts use! Save yourself time, money, and hassle: purchase the hardcover Harvard University Press edition, ISBN 9780674362505 (available here on Amazon atGreek Grammar). The Benediction Classics work will not give you what you need as an expert and will only give you grief as a student."
1,The Reactionary Bible of Postmillennial Evangelical Protestantism,"Published in 1886, Strong's Our Country spoke immediately and eloquently to Protestant America. Over a period of 30 years the book sold 175,000 copies.A postmillennial evangelical defense of Anglo-Saxon rural America against Roman Catholicism, Mormonism, socialism, mammonism, materialism, immigration, the liquor power and other dred scourges of a modern urbanized society.Available in an on-line edition."
3,Phelps not the author,"Friends,Austin Phelps, 5th Bartlet Professor of Sacred Rhetoric at Andover Theological Seminary from 1848-79, is absolutely wonderful; I give the highest possible recommendation to all his writings. But his contribution to this book is brief (a 5-page intro/endorsement). The book's author is Josiah Strong."
3,Simply written yet heart-stirring,"This is a simply written, heartfelt devotional book. In ""My Heart's Desire: Living Every Moment in the Wonder of Worship"", David Jeremiah draws you in to the pictures he paints in the book. You find yourself in Heaven's throne room, weeping and then rejoicing with John as the Lamb is found worthy to open the book. The awe and wonder which this book inspires is aimed to incite you to greater heights of worship. Indeed all of life is to be lived as a worshiper of Christ.For those looking for light yet devotional reading, this book will do nicely. It's not all that profound, but the message is straightforward. And yes, its convicting. May your heart for Christ be strengthened as you read this book."
5,Excellent book,"Although I purchased this book for myself, I haven't had the opportunity to read it yet. My former pastor borrowed it. He has read it three times, and wept every time he read it. I'm getting ready to order him his own copy so I can have mine back. He says it's a wonderful book."
5,best buy!!!,this is perfect fit to my american classic II 45 full sized!i will highly recommend this product. it came out very good on the package! no issue whatsoever...
1,Too small for guns advertised. 1911 owners keep looking and spend less.,Holster is smaller than advertised. Springfield 1911 too snug for easy access. Clip is plastic. 1911 owners keep looking for a better holster. You can get better quality for less money
3,just so so,"FOR the price, I CANNOT ask more. The charger seems work at the beginning, but when i turn on my PSP, it shuts...and i cannot turn on it anymore..."
3,read this,its usb charger doesnt charge my psp even after 3-4 hours..so be careful for the cheap stuff you buy
3,hit or miss,"i needed to replace the one i lost, so i ordered this on, but the one i got did not work. but i think it was just not made right."
1,poor,This product worked for a week and now will not charge the psp at all....very disappointed from this seller....I do not recomend this product to anyone...
3,"Works, but there are better options.","I purchased this cable without really thinking too much about it. Yes, it does what it is supposed to do, however it won't allow you to charge the PSP while connected only through USB. I have an external hard drive with the same USB fittings, and the cable for that transfers data as well as charges the PSP. Why purchase a split cable when you can have a single cable that does both at once? Either way, cable was cheap and arrived very quickly. I just would suggest finding a simple data transfer cable that charges the PSP as well."
3,Charging complications,"Well, it pretty much defeats the purpose that I bought this for, but it CAN charge via USB but only if turned off or in standby mode. If you try to wake up or turn on the PSP with this cord plugged into the charger port, then the PSP will turn off. It works okay for data, but since I wanted to use it with the usb adapter in my car to use my PSP as an mp3 player, it doesn't do much good that I can power it through my car while it plays...so I have to either wait until it dies for it to charge or I don't know...My car's outlet doesn't have power when the car is off, so it's pretty much pointless."
4,Power Cable works on Sony PRS-600,"This works great as PRS-600 DC adapter, too, with MOST USB ports. So you don't have to take off password to charge as you do when using the USB connector!"
1,Not designed for 1000 series,"I thought this would charge my 1000 series PSP. It would not. I fiddled with it for a few hours before just leaving it plugged in (orange ""charging"" light and all) for about three hours while the PSP was turned off. It was one percentage point lower than it was when I plugged it in. It does allow for data transfer between computer and PSP, but not charging."
1,NOT FOR PSP 1001,"They lied when they said this product works or 1000, it does not. I will be getting my money back."
2,Too expensive for what you get,I purchased this toy from Marshall's and it broke the second day my daughter had it. It is supposed to make a noise when turned over and that broke. Don't waste your money. My daughter loves the plain stacker from fisher price.
1,Pirate CD - no good!,"This recording is a pirated version of a video produced by Arco Films ""Am√°lia Rodrigues, Live in New York City"" which was recorded at Town Hall in 1990. I don't recomend this CD as the audio quality is very bad. For best quality on this performance look for the video which is available in Portugal, Spain, France released by EMI or in the US released by Kultur Video. There are a number of pirate CD's out there. I strongly recomend buyers to make sure they get the Am√°lia CD's that are released by EMI records. Any other recordings are cheap, fast, bad-quality pirated tapes that were put out in the market to capitalize on the fact that Am√°lia Rodrigues recently passed away. The best quality CD released by EMI is called ""The Art of Am√°lia"" (it includes her best performances from 1950 to 1970)."
1,Not Recommended,"The photos and the visual impression of this product is positive. It is during use that this product fails badly. The blades pivot on a pin, of course, and the tension on the blades is supplied by a spring. When I was younger, the tension on tools like this (scissors, clippers, etc.) was adjustable and controlled by a fine-thread nut/bolt arrangement. Unfortunately, on these clippers, that arrangement has been replaced by a fixed (non-adjustable) rivet with the tension is fixed due to the lack of a means to adjust that tension. As a result, the tension isn't sufficient and if I try to trim anything more than a half dozen blades of blue grass at one time, the blades separate and the grass jambs between the two blades. In my view, this is a very poorly engineered product and useless for the task intended. I bit the bullet and tossed these in favor of a new set of clippers. You'd be wise to look elsewhere and profit by my (expensive) mistake."
4,Fiskars power lever grass Shears,"Very nicely made, but despite the name of the product--you supply the power; and after years of working a string weed wacker, I found my hand got tiried pretty quickly. Good sharp, well made product. Stan"
1,Blades fell off the handle after unpacking,I unpacked the shears went out to try them and the blades immediately fell off the handle. Needless to say I am returning them.
1,No,"Idi Amin will die comfortably in bed of old age; Martin Luther King and Gandhi were shot dead; much of humanity is starving and unhappy, and there's nothing we can do to help; and Wyndham Hill release records of such unbelievable mediocrity that I cry myself to sleep at night because of it. I bought this entirely for the Penguin Cafe Orchestra contribution, but decided to listen to the rest. It's precisely the kind of thing that gives 'New Age' a bad name - sappy, inoffensive, empty and utterly false background music for faux-ethnic shops that sell Taiwanese-made wooden African masks and scented candles, for people who find proper classical music 'too edgy'."
5,Excellent book!,This is an excellent book that I'm using for my intermediate high ESL students. They are learning quickly and easily.
5,Onyx set,Just one of many items to replace those lost in our housefire. Very good quality. Wrapped Securely. Arrived early. Thank you to all involved. I have purchased other colors of this set and like them all.
2,"Works, but mediocre image quality","I got it working w/o much trouble, but it's not great image quality. Substantially worse quality than if I play movies out of my DVD player to my TV. If I put it through an rf converter to put it into my TV rather than plugging directly in the rca port on my TV (for convenience w/ my setup) -- as suggested for older TVs in the instructions -- the image is completely washed out and useless.I don't know what quality is available with other boxes. I got this one because it was cheap, and it works, though I wish it was better quality for watching Netflix instant downloads..."
1,Not So Great,wellgoing on reviews of this product..I purchased one.I have a Dell Vostro 1000......and have spent the last 3 and 1/2 hrs trying to get this to work. All Im getting is a BLACK screen. Ive called my Dell dealer twice..and still Nadda'...So I either take it in to get it to work or send it back....very disapointedSo far its no more then a lesson in frustration....Sk
1,Bad time consumer and teaser!!!,"This device looks good but is a waste of time.Once you plug everything up,you think you're ready to have fun.You'll begin trying different avenues for a solution but will get nowhere.For me,the sound works crisp and clear but the images show up shaking as you watch them.I think the problem is the VGA cord."
1,Piece of junk. Don't buy if are thinking to ccnnect laptop and TV,"I purchased this item online and returned the very next day. I watch live tv from india. so , i got this item to connect to my tv . i could only see flickering b/w and colors. :) see what i got for 46$ . I have a dell inspiron laptop which does not have a tv out/s-video. i purchased this scan converter , hoping this would help. i don't want to spend $$$ to connect my laptop to tv.If you intend to do the same. be warned, it won't work.cheers.happy shopping."
3,Looks just like that...,Looks just like that and it works quite well but I rarely use it... Not bad though.
3,Effective but not as good as its big brother,"While it does what it claims to do, I wouldn't have bought it if I had known the next step up was available for $20 more. No adjustments for picture quality (finetuning does zilch). The next model up does have a full menu of adjustments that make it possible to do color correction, screen size formating, etc. without having to adjust your TV or monitor. Still, as a basic function, it works fine."
3,"Worked on my old 20"" box tv but was horrible on my 50"" flat screen","Worked on my old 20"" box tv but was horrible on my 50"" flat screen. The quality goes down significantly. For it's price, it's not very good. Unfortunately, my TV didn't have the VGA input so I got this."
4,Basic and works,This is very basic and it will not be sharp and perfectly centered on the screen maybe...but it works reliably and very easy to install/setup. Keep it on 640x480 if you want any chance of reading what's on the screen though. This is NOT for reading large amounts of text! Great for watching online videos and streaming content from the net though.
2,"Easy to Use, but Difficult to See","I purchased this for use with the Netflix ""Watch Now"" feature. I figured I would watch movies on my regular TV using this device. I was able to get it up and running with no problems, and was watching a movie on my TV within minutes.However, I no longer use this device, and simply watch internet movies on my laptop screen or a PC monitor. Why? Because the screen is so dark that any scene that is not in broad daylight is difficult to see and follow. I tried every possible resolution and setting to see better, but nothing helped.It's a good idea, and a good design, but ultimately an unusable product."
3,[Three-and-a-half stars out of five] Outstanding overview of the,"slacker Pierre Elliot Trudeau's reignof terror over Canada. Well, at leasthe did a ceremonial 'kickoff' at the'69 and '70 Grey Cups! The author didgood work here not only with the titlebut with the contents as well! Recommended!"
1,Has never worked,This tool looks quite different from what estheticians have used during my facials in the past. This thing hasn't worked for me once. It now sits unused in my drawer.
1,Body Toolz Facial Skin Care Tool,I have found this item to be totally unacceptable. It promised to allow me to get rid of blackheads on my face and it hasn't worked at all. What a waste my purchase was.
4,Extra Wands a Good Idea for Large Family,I bought these in addition to the Tiger that came with one wand. It allows more kids to play the game together. You should consider buying extra wands if there is more than 1 child in the family. (Or even if Mom or Dad want to play.)
4,Pretty good toy,Works well.Both my kids like it (3 1/2 and 1 1/2)Wish it picked up the monket under a thing or two.
4,Entertaining and fun!,My son loves hide and seek so this toy is perfect! We ordered 2 extra sticks so more friends could play!! Great idea!!
4,great fun!,The wands were smaller than I envisioned but the kids age 2-13! Had fun looking for the monkey with the sensor wands! The gift was a big Christmas hit!
2,Advanced All Grain Brewing Video,"If you are a Homebrewer with at least a couple of brews under your belt, consider another video. This is NOT an Advanced type Video. It would be great for the soon to be Extract Brewer, or first time Partial/ Mini Mash Brewer, I have Homebrewed for several years now and was seeking ways to improve on All Grain Brewing skills. This is not the Video for me. I fully support this type of production to encourage new Brewers into this great hobby, I just think this Video is poorly titled."
2,The Bear River Massacre and the Making of History,"As a student persuing a Ph.D in American Indian History, I was not impressed with this book. Fleisher goes into long detail about her own experiences while writing her book, and what little ""history"" she does relate is easily found on the internet. The sources she uses are secondary and tertiary sources at best. If you want to learn about the Shoshoni and the Bear River massacre, I suggest one of Brigham D. Madsen's books; The Shoshoni Frontier and the Bear River Massacre, or Encounter with the Northwestern Shoshoni at Bear River in 1863: Battle or Massacre."
1,Not so good,"As an individual who has an MA in military history and has written articles on the Bear River Massacre I think this work had very little historical value. It was written by an English teacher and not a historian, it has very little historical value for real historical scholars. The book is primarily about the author and not the massacre, being written in first person. Further, it was written in non scholarly MLA type format rather than any scholarly hostorical format. If you want to actually read about the subject matter, read Dr. Madsen's works, he is the subject matter expert."
5,Astounding first novel,One of the best books I've ever read - engaging characters - crisp insight into their lives. Drinnan has a new book coming out this winter check this one out first
5,Great Australian novel -- gay-oriented subjet matter,"When we think of good adult movies we should think of the brilliant acting of Burton and Taylor, or of the directing of Billy Wilder or Mike Nichols. When we think of good adult books we should think of Nabokov (""Lolita"") or Neal Drinnan (""Glove Puppet"").For such a short novel the plot goes in so many ways, yet stays entirely coherent. Written in the first person by a 20-year-old, the boy's mood changes with his age and with the story. The writing, however, is consistent from cover to cover.The story is fascinating and will take the reader through a whole range of emotions. It makes one wish the author had been paid by the word, so the novel would infill every detail.Australians have been turning out great stuff for decades. Here's another outstanding novel. Since it's short everyone should take the time to read it. Neal Drinnan was in his early 30s when he wrote ""Glove Puppet."" We can all hope he has many more excellent novels to write."
3,"Good racquet, not personal favorite.","I am an advanced beginner. Bought this racquet a while ago because it had good reviews and the price was right. It is a good racquet, but personally I would prefer something that has an even balance or be a bit head-heavy (the racquet is very head-light). Also found the handle to be too thin (which is usually the case), so had to apply anextra layer of wrap."
4,Great,The other review is spot on. These sleeves are very thick and seem pretty ideal if you or your kids like to show the cards off or transport them around a lot. They're also pretty good at protecting other documents! I liked them so much I stuck my social security card in one!
1,Don't bother,"Package clearly states it imports resumes. When you get to that part it tells you that if you want to import it will have to be plain text (i.e. no Word docs), with bullets and formatting removed. Well, that's pretty much just not importing.Secondly, the program hangs on XP all the time. I have a brand new machine, with patches. And I updated Resume Maker right off. Still hangs.Really, this is a waste of money. I'm giving up on it and going back to Word. All the other 'features' (sample resumes, etc.) can be found at many websites."
1,Simply does not work as adverised,"If all you want to do is create and print a resume you might be happy with this software. None of the other features work. Resume Maker states that you can choose from thirty different styles in which to print your resume. Doesn't work. Resume Maker also says that you can e-mail your resume and it will retain its original format. Not so. I sent a resume to a prospective employer, making sure I sent it in the format requested. (HTML) It was a mess. I had to send a hard copy byUPS. Individual Software has yet to responed to e-mails sent to customer service."
4,The Official Guide to Metru Nui,"My son is a Bionicle fanatic and likes this a lot (well, anything about Bionicles would make that cut). It is very similar to ""The Official Guide to Bionicle,"" but for Metru Nui instead of Mata Nui. It fills in background details about each Metru."
2,Disappointed-.,Out of each batch of seeds I've tried to grow only half have sprouted. I will try another company next time.
5,Repeat customer,"Great products! I have never been disappointed with my orders! Local seeds, nothing from China. Good germination rate with the seeds."
2,"Not really mixed well. This ""mix"" is mostly clover. While not necessarily bad, clover is one of the cheapest sprouts out there","I usually like buying things from The Sprout House, but this mix needs to be looked at. While it is advertised as a mix of broccoli, alfalfa, and clover what it really has is just clover.Anyone that's been sprouting for a while can easily tell the difference between clover and alfalfa (even though they are incredibly similar), and the last six batches I grew were ALL around 80% clover.Clover and alfalfa are both fairly cheap sprouts, where as broccoli is not. I don't quite understand why they can't have a simple 40/40/20 mix of the three and call it a day. As it is, I believe the mix contains around 80% clover, 15% alfalfa and a whopping 5% broccoli seeds.Paying $15 for a pound of mostly Clover is a rip off, since other sites sell that seed for half the price.You would be better off buying a pound of clover AND a pound of alfalfa for less than $17."
4,Yum!,"Just new to the sprout eaters club. I mixed this mix with some lentils that I had and it really helped me get the most flavor for the $$ out of the mix. Lentils added body, and these tasty bits added wonderful flavor. I think I might need to get a sprouter though. They take like 5 days to get fluffy like I like them!"
3,"...good, but not as good as i hoped...","i've been wrestlin with this cd for about a month now...and it's okay...no, it's better than okay...i just aint feelin this the way i'd like to. her voice is alright, but this album just feels a bit dated, like it shoulda came out in the late 80's and i hafta blame the production for that! it took a month for n'dambi to grow on me and maybe karen will too in time...this isnt a bad purchase/i dont regret buyin it and i'm glad i did...this woulda been the sh!t if it coulda came out 5 or 6 years ago when neo-soul was really catchin on, because this only suffers due to that ""been there, done that""-syndrome.but if you like rachelle farrell's latest disc, then this one just might please you like that one, too."
3,I really want to like this CD but........,"I believe she could've promoted this CD a little more. I knew it was out, but hadn't heard not one track until now. Karen has a beautiful jazz singers voice but production fell short on a lot of her tracks. The band is tight and the grooves are plentyful, but after hearing N'Dambi, Mama's Gun, Amel Larriuex and Ursula Rucker, I just can't grasp this with my ears right now........... maybe later.oNe"
3,John Sloan Artist,"PRO: This is a fine book that shows very nice examples of the works of John Sloan, all while providing a competent biography of the artist as a whole. I have found this book useful for incites on the ashcan school and the products of Sloans work's such as etchings, paintings, and drawings. This is a solid book for any art student or student aspiring to broaden their understanding of Sloan's painting career.CON: If you a looking for a book in which all, and I stress ALL, works are in color then this book is not for you. Only select pieces are in color the rest black and white. You may also consider that the works included are a collection its not 100% paintings, etchings, or drawings, but a mix. This maybe a con for people only acquiring this for color theory research on Sloan / image research strictly for visuals."
5,cajun trail mix,Thanks u guys r the best got my fix for a little bit cant find these but at one store in western new york
2,Not the Same,They took out the little rice moon crackers that were my favorite. I wish I had known. The package is different now. It needs to be updated on Amazon. Same flavor but not complete. Would not have ordered a whole box.
4,Tasty trail mix,"Liked this trail mix very much, though would have liked it spicier. The salty mix of nuts, sesame sticks, corn nuts and other stuff is quite satisfying - though it usually takes the whole bag to get it done."
3,is not wha it looks like in the pic< completely different. very dissatisfied.,"I odered because i love these, but when i got the box the bags were different and the contents are not what they used to be. I wouldn't buy it, is not like the picture, the added to many nuts and less of the good stuff. dissapointed"
3,Good Value,This product is a very good value. It works very well but squeeked loudly until I gave it some silicone spray (still squeeks some). Also one rowing arm had the threaded hole for the locking nut stripped out when it arrived. I read other reviewers that had the same problem. The company sent a replacement very quickly. Overall a good product for someone that isn't looking for a high quality rowing machine.
1,COASTER MAKER,"When I searched the Amazon site for Adaptec software, I was reacting to the abysmal performance of the CD writer that comes with the ver 7.01 Windows Media Player. I thought, why is the company displaying such a large ad to upgrade to the Deluxe product. I still have no clue. I own two other CD burning products, which unfortunately do not convert from Microsoft's WMA file format. Adaptec's software is horribly buggy. My error rate on over 30 CDs was about 35%. That's correct: one of three CD writes failed. The first couple of writes, I thought, might be the result of other software interfering. So, I closed ever single program under Windows 98SE except Explorer and Systray, and still obtained this awful success rate. I can only conclude that Adaptec thinks that we are a bunch of fools who think that paying them [price] for an ungrade will magically make their software perform where it was not capable before. As for support, read the review below and believe it."
2,"this sucks, worst 1 yet","ohh my god does this movie suck, it is crap, honestly what was adam herz thinking when he wrote this, probably nuthin. the charecters are annoyin as ever especally michelle, her mother, kevin and jim and i 4 1 am bored of this franchise now, never thought i'd say that bcause i loved the first 2.the director Jesse Dylan isnt very good at what he does, i no i culdnt do better but i am not a director, they should of stuck with the origional directors (paul & chris wietz and J.B Rodgers)the reason i gave it 2 stars was stifler, although annoyin sometimes he is the movies saving grace. plz dnt buy plz dnt rent watch it when its on tv, defentaly not worth it. oh yeah the little kid who said this is the best film ever, what age are u 7, ur delousional kid."
3,Overdid it sometimes,"Don't get me wrong...this was a great third part of the great American Pie trilogy but I thought they got carried away with some things. Stifler's character was always slightly on the retarded side, but I felt like they overdid his crude attitude in this movie. That was unnecessary, and Jim seemed even more dumb than in the first two movies (take a certain shaving incident!). Nevertheless, this movie has some very sweet parts aside from the crude humor.The bonus material on the DVD isn't half bad either. There's the making of featurette, deleted scenes, and outtakes. Good to keep you occupied for a while. :)"
1,Junk,"The first movie of the trilogy was bad, the second one was funny, really funny. But producers couldn't do it worse making this movie. You can't laugh with nothing, Sean William Scott has talent and he wastes his time doing this they call movie. No plot and bad acting."
1,Waste of Fred Willard,"What a waste of comedic talent, such as Eugene Levy and Fred Willard. The first two American Pies were hilarious, but this one was a total waste of time."
5,best american pie,"the is the funniest one. i laugh so hard i laughed hard. they did a great jorb in this one. i thought they were gonna crap it up, but they didnt. this is one of the funniest movie of 2003. the thing with movie it's just hilarious. and im not really much of a shawn william scott dude. he was ok in dude wheres my car. the thing was i didnt think it was gonna be good because not everyone from the original cast was in it. and the dude from rookie of the year didnt really do anything. same with the dude from saving silverman, all he did was get married. na they were all funny. this is a must seen movie and a must get dvd. get it"
5,Great movie,I bought it as a gift and it came very quickly! This movie is a great movie if you're looking to laugh!
3,disappointed,"i got it and put it in, but it was skipping. i took it out thinking that it has some dust on it from getting shipped, so i cleaned it. come to find out, there were some scratches on the back of the disk. i dont have a printer so i cant print out anything to have it shipped back so i could get one that doesnt have any scratches on the back of it. i was looking forward to watching it too."
3,Not as great as the first two,I was a huge fan of the first and second American Pie. Those was hilarious. This just seemed to be stretching it too far. It makes sense to end the series on this movie because it completes the romantic story line but I just did not find it all that funny. Its worth watching once or twice but not worth the purchase. If you are a fan of American Pie I suggest renting this movie instead of buying it.
2,Godawful,"This movie just tries to squeeze out a few more million out of our pockets by reusing all the jokes from the previous two movies. What you saw in the previews was about the extent of the jokes -- and those weren't funny at that.The only worthwhile part of the movie -- if a part can be called worthwhile; nothing could have saved this disaster -- would be the acting of Seann William Scott. His ability to critique each moment with one of his memorable quips was somewhat interesting. Even with him, I still give the movie only 2 stars.If you must see the movie in order to finish out the series, get it from the rental store or a friend, but do not buy it. You will regret it."
4,Great pie!,I am really going to miss the AMERICAN PIE series. This is an excellent movie and is very much underated. It had a very good storyline (especially at the bucks night) and hilarious twists and turns which are guaranteed to make you crack up laughing. The intellegence of the characters(stifler) is also funny. This movie shows all the pros and cons of a wedding and how to impress the in laws. MUST SEE for anyone who liked any of the other american pie movies or a comedy fan.
2,Bad movie.. Worse DVD...,"I won't go into any great detail about the movie. I felt that it was bad. Even the editing was poor--scenes were cut in the middle of actor's lines.The DVD quality is horrible. The colors are over-saturated and the wrong hue, and detail in the blacks is crushed. Overall a dark transfer with bright orange skin color."
2,"Eugene Levy is hilarious, third PIE is not","American Wedding (2003) Jason Biggs, Seann William Scott, Alyson Hannigan, Eddie Kaye Thomas, Thomas Ian Nicholas, January Jones, Eugene Levy, Molly Cheek, Deborah Rush, Fred Willard, D: Jesse Dylan.After a three-year relationship, Jim proposes to band-geek girlfriend Michelle, which means bringing members of the gang to help him tie the knot (excluding the leading ladies), a lot more embarrassing mishaps, and a bachelor party for the obnoxious, one-track-minded Stifler.Third helping of PIE makes room for more sexism and tastelessness, which can't cure its phase for showing its age mark. The heart is left out here from the film digging so low for more funny stuff, but all we get is the cake topped on with pubic shavings and some masticated doggie poo! If you prefer potty humor like so, here's a pie in the face! Directors of the first, Paul and Chris Weitz are co-producers.Running Time: 96 minutes and rated R for sexual content, language, and crude humor."
1,bad taste,I thought this was a sexist movie. I wish they would make a movie of teenage girls looking at naked guys for a change!!!!iT'S ALWAYS THE OTHER WAY AROUND BECAUSE MEN MAKE THESE MOVIES AND THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT TO SEE!
1,Movie is good but Amazon's streaming service is terrible.,"The movie is a good one, I've been meaning to watch it for a while. Unfortunately, I had to go elsewhere to watch it. Amazon's streaming is absolutely terrible. Video playback freezes every few seconds and completely stops every couple of minutes. After wasting $3 on a failed effort, I am moving on to streaming from other paying sources like Youtube Movies."
5,Quick and Painless,"This was my first purchase from Amazon, so I was a little skeptical getting a gift from here, but it arrived within 2 days and was exactly what I expected"
4,Still going strong!,"American Wedding is so far the funniest installment to the trilogy.This one finds Jim and Michelle getting married,opening with what I've found to be the naughtiest scene I've ever seen take place in a resturant.Stifler brings more laughs to the screen as Stifler,who thinks the first thing that comes to his mind when he thinks of weddings:Bachelor party!The biggest scene,basically,is the bechelor party scene,where a gay guy Jim and his pals met in a gay bar brings a couple of foreign strippers to Jim's house and they party for a while,until it's busted up by the early return of Jim and Michelle's parents.Laughs and gut-busting humor ensue as the pals get caught up in what might be the best film in the trilogy."
3,Successful Tale Starts to Sink,"I loved American Pie. I loved the sequel. American Wedding, however shows a downward movement of this widely successful tale of high school friends endlessly in search of gratification. Do not get me wrong, I enjoyed this film, but not nearly as much as I enjoyed the two previous installments. The acting in this film was of similar nature to its predecessors, and the jokes were in the same vein. Overall, however, I feel that this film did not live up to the legacy created by the original. Despite a few good laughs, and some gratuitous nudity, this film was not at all what I expected it to be. I give this film 3 stars."
3,And now it's over...,"While this wasn't the strongest of the three 'Pie' movies, I really enjoyed it. I think that some of the secondary characters suffered a bit from lack of screentime, but the overall story was just as good as the other 2 movies."
3,Fast & Light - Good For A Few Laughs,"""American Wedding"" is not a great film...it is not even a good film. But I managed to watch it all the way through and was reasonably entertained, so I'm not going to complain about it. With the setup of the first two lackluster films, the bar was not set very high for the climax. One surprise is the rise of Stiffler, who has grown large enough to dominate the entire film. Though, in order to do so they have had to dumb down his character even more so than in the first two films.I did not find ""American Wedding"" hilarious, but it certainly has enough laughs to keep the pace light and fast. If you're looking for a fun movie to rent and you liked the first two, you might try this film on for size. It's reasonably entertaining and requires no brain effort to watch."
3,funny but...,"it was amusing, glad I saw it, will get the DVD eventualy, but nothing new. More of the same situations, lines, and embarrasing moments. I definatly think I would rate the movies in the series inline with their release (1, 2, then 3 as the worst of the bunch)."
1,Once Was Enough,The original American Pie was cute. A high school version of Animal House. The sequel was dissappointing and this third installment borders on unbearable.The same cheap humor is rehashed over and over again with little sign of originality. How often can you have Finch pursuing Stiffler's mother? Stiffler is oh so annoying as if all he ever thinks about is crude sex. The scenes with the dogs humping Jim and Stiffler are repulsive. You would think this group would have grown up but obviously they have not.I know that I may sound prudish but I appreciate sexual innuendo when it is done with some tact and clever lines. American Wedding does not come within seven miles of cleverness. Pass on this and pick something else. ALMOST ANYTHING ELSE!!!!!!!
1,AMERICAN PIE III WAS VERY GOOD,IT WAS SOOOOOOOOO FUNNY IN THIS MOVIE...LOL.....STIFFLER WENT TO A GAY BAR AND THOUGHT HE WAS GONNA MEET A HOT GIRL AND MET A GUY.....AND THE DANCING SCENE WAS THE GREATEST....I LOVE ALL THOSE 80S SONGS.......BEAR WAS ACTUALLY PRETTY COOL...AND DANCED GOOD TOO.....I DIDNT SEE THE REST BUT THERE WAS A LOT OF GOOD DANCING....STIFFLER IS PRETTY COOL SOMETIMES....SO GO OUT AND SEE IT IF YOU HAVENT YO!!!!!!! STRAIGHT UP FUNNY HILARIOUS GREAT GREAT SUPER GRETA MOVIE!!!!!!!!!
1,Let down,"The gross outs were fun in the first film, the second was ok but this one just reeks! Nothing new here & half the cast is missing. It just came off very awkward & very tired."
4,Halarious!!!!!!,"I went to see this movie at the theatre the day it came out and I was in kind of a bad mood, but when I got done watching this it lifted up my spirits. I thought it was halarious!! The only downside was that a few of the original characters didn't make an apperance in this movie! But even without them it was still a great comedy! I recommend this to all! :)"
1,a bit dissapointing,"walked away feeling slightly disappointed ;(Seems to me that stifler tried way to hard to be crudly funny, thumbs down on his charater this time. was Hoping to find some of the same ""wet your pants"" laughing as the previous ones, and relized that the charaters may have out grown their high school antics. I'd say wait for the rental. Seen it, been there, and came home with a ticket stub.:("
4,Gotta Have Your Third Slice,"I loved the other two films, read bad reviews, and put off seeing this one for a while. Just shows you can't trust critics. I think this film had the most laugh-out-loud funny moments of the series (I don't see many films where people keep going for minutes, there are two scenes which involve dogs...well, you just have to see the film). The characters, for the most part, are rounded out beautifully (a few aren't given enough to do). Sean William Scott's ""Stifler"" will go down in movie history. Kudos also to Biggs, Hannigan, Thomas, and Levy, who add subtle shades to characters we've come to know. The biggest surprise for me is that this wasn't a sloppy sequel (um, unless you mean messiness, like the scene where...see the movie). The opening scene in the restaurant, to me, was the funniest moment of the whole series."
2,Two Was Enough,"I saw this movie on the opening night and can only say that it was a complete waste of time and money. With half of the cast from the first two movies missing the interesting interplay was largely missing as well. Seann William Scott as ""Stifler"" seemed like he was really trying to force it even though he largely plays the same character in every movie. There were some funny moments, but there were also some gross-out moments that were meant to be funny, but didn't work. I just wouldn't recommend this to anyone and I really enjoyed the others."
5,Read BEFORE you buy!,"I gave this movie 5 bright stars for keeping right in line with the other American Pie flicks. The original cast of characters pull off another great performance. If you liked the first 2 in the series then without a doubt you will love this one (as it on the same premise).Also, girls an added feature for us- since we like love stories with happy endings- they actually get married and have a commitment to each other. But guys don't worry because it does not distract from this largely hilaroius movie. I would have to say I luaghed more during this than during the other 2.The ONLY WARNING I have for those thinking about buying this movie is that just like the other movies within the series, it is not meant for children or young teenagers who cannot grasp it's concepts or tell the difference between true life and fiction. The language and overall tone of the movie is jsut not sutied for the young or immature."
1,Wanted to laugh...,"Caught the matine on sunday early afternoon...About 25 or so in the crowd. I wanted to hope it was equal to the 1st, or at least as good as #2-but WHAT A LET DOWN! only heard a few small laughs throughout the entire film. I was bored and couldn't wait for the end."
2,to many people where cut out of the movie,first off i dont know why but the picture quality of this movie just seems badand also why did they cut so many people out of this movie1. first off they cut out oz i mean seriosly he was 1 of the main chractors and a good one at that2. second off they cut out jessica and vicky3. third off they cut out nadia4.fourth off they cut out oz's girlfriendThe only reason i really put 2 stars cause its part of one of my favorite trilogies.The acting is good but the movie over all is a 1.5
4,Still laughing,"This is almost as funny as American Pie and American Pie 2, but the humor is getting more than a little predictable. However, I am still laughing so 4 stars."
2,Foul language all around,They almost destroyed the movie by giving Sean William Scott so much room and transforming Stifler character in a machine gun spitting foul language along two hours of movie time. Amazing!
5,American Wedding,"This movie is better than Just Married. Stifler and Cadence are like Tom Leezak and Sarah McNerney a boring normal married couple who would be divorced three or four years that's why I didn't. Seann William Scott knew January Jones Dude's Where's My Car when she was dating Ashton Kutcher. Stifler didn't see a future with her when he and Finch didn't get the girl. If Kevin's girlfriend showed up I was always wish Sarah Michelle Gellar played his girlfriend. No way Stifler thought a beautiful girl go for Kevin. Of all the wedding movies I saw this one is my favorite, because I rooted for Jim Levinstein and Michelle Flaherty. Kevin, Finch and Jim's Dad loved Michelle that's why they rooted for Jim to Marry her."
4,"funny, but no.2 is better!","Ill sum it up in a couple of words. Excelleny movie, but where the hell is oz and every1 else?????????"
3,The first two were better.,"I really wanted to like this movie before I saw it. Unfortunately, it falls short of the hilarity of the first two (the second one was my personal favorite). It's not terrible (hence, three stars). It's just not up to par with it's two predecessors. I think the reason I didn't like it as much was simply the lack of ""Michelle"" in the movie. Oh, sure, Alyson Hannigan was in the movie. However, for a movie that was supposedly about her wedding, she didn't have very much to do and her part, except for the hilarious proposal scene, wasn't written nearly as funny as it was before. I guess that's my main objection to the movie. Everything else was pretty similar to the other two movies. This one just had less of the funny, wacky ""Michelle"" that we had come to know. I really missed that."
2,Are these reviewers on drugs?,"I just got done seeting this movie and it was terrible! I loved American Pie #1, #2 was pretty good, #3 was so forced I was amazed. They crammed Stiffler in there so badly it ruined the movie."
3,American Wedding DVD,"Gross, Very Funny, but long, The Dance sequence is funny yet not too much, The first two installments of this movie were better, Alot better. At least this is in the tradition of keeping most of the cast unlike more spinoffs! Not the best."
5,BEST MOVIE EVER,Wow! I love the american pies and this one is the funniest! I laughed sooooo hard. After the 2nd one i was kind of disappointed. The 1st was so darn funny i almost peed myself. The 3rd was sooooooooo hilarious. My one question is though why was stifler so gay?
1,No more stiflers or stifler clones. please seann! More SRM,"Stifler is one of my all time favorite characters and Seann Scott has more than delivered on this character that was little more than a minor character in t he first movie, and good for him. BUT, American Wedding was the least good of the three PIE films and I pray that there will NOT be a fourth. I was so disappointed in this film and how lacluster it was. All the movie executives at Universal who said this film was a ""go"" out there in Hollywood should lose their jobs. But not before paying back a lot of loyal fans whom they roped into seeing this piece of studio garbage.On the other side of the coin, Seann's latest DVD,Stark Raving Mad - is a great film and I want to see Seann in more films like that... no more stiflers or stifler clones (The Rundown, road trip etc etc)Go do some more edgy indie stuff. SRM rocked. Fire the American Pie guys at universal and go back to the indie guys from SRM and keep making real movies."
2,Jim & Michelle Ties the Knot...,"American Wedding is the third film in this series of comedies and in this episode Jim (Jason Biggs) is tying to tie the knot with Michelle (Alyson Hannigan). Knowing Jim from the previous films, the story is about to go wrong somewhere and it does so right from the beginning when Jim is about to pop the question. In the shadow of continuous blunders, Jim's father (Eugene Levy) is spicing up the slap-stick humor with his intentional good-will. Despite the jokes, the story falls flat on it's face because it consists of one silly joke on top of another which prevents it from taking off. In the end the audience will have had several belly-aching laughs, but is left with an empty cinematic experience."
2,bad mouthed,"MAYBE AMERICAN WEDDING SHOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED AMERICAN DISASTER.TOO MUCH FOUL LANGUAGE THAT WAS OVERDONE THAT EVENTUALY LED TO THE MOVIES DEMISE,IT ALMOST BECAME A BIG BORE.IF NOT FOR THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN QUITE PLEASENT.NOWHERE NEAR AS GOOD AS AMERICAN PIE,THE DIRECTOR JUST RAN OUT OF IDEAS HOPEFULY THIS WILL BE THE LAST.SEE IT AT YOUR OWN PERIL."
1,"Terrible, low-class, coarse humor","If a screen writer intended to make a movie that was disgusting, not funny, focused on the lowest and basest instincts to such an extent that it would be even less interesting than a raunchy ... movie, this would be the movie that was created.First, why is it necessary to end this series even more revolting than it started? When the series began, it certainly was sexually-explicit, but it was by no means close to obscene.Also, every scene was highly predictable. All I had to do was think: ""What is the easiest thing for a screen writer to create,"" and before my brain could process a result, I saw it on the screen. Certainly we, the movie-going audience expect to be somewhat entertained by substantive dialogue and an actual script. It is unfortunate that this movie fails on all counts."
1,A Cinematic Disaster,"I would rather suck on a tail-pipe than watch this film again. If you like the first two films, and you are not moron, then I can assure you that you will hate this film. It was like the writers and the actors just stopped caring."
2,American Stifler,"Once Steve Stifler appears on screen, you realize that everyone else in the movie is just there for scenery. Stifler is the movie. Wedding? What wedding? It takes a backseat to Stifler on the onslaught of profanity and nudity. Is that a bad thing? Not necessarily, but the movie really reaches to get it's laughs. Some are genuine, but many are very forced. I wouldn't say that this movie is a failure. It just tries too hard to recapture the glory of the first film."
4,good book,describes the different types of tantra I enjoyed reading it it gave me more insight on tantraagain don't know what else to say
2,magical,"Here it is, the definitive account of Tantra. Assume Yoga, Gita, Veda, Acharya, Ramayana, Pranayama and Vedanta. Now contemplate the subtitle, ""Seducing the Forces of Nature."" What could be greater than seducing Mahakali, the Great Goddess herself, into giving us everything our teensy little hearts desire? Yet one must be wary of who is seducing whom. ""Wallowing in ignorance time and again, the fools imagine, 'We have reached our aim!' Because of their passion, they do not understand, these people who are given to rites. Therefore, they fall, wretched and forlorn, when their heavenly stay comes to a close [Mundaka Upanishad 1.2.9]."" On a practical level, there are photos of how to hold one's hands in mudra (again, assume the basics of adoration and supplication). There is also a 60-day ritual for curing insomnia, that is bound to put anyone to sleep. More secret knowledge is available from bona-fide lineage-holders. Just remember: it's not *nice* to fool Mother Nature...."
3,Funny and Not So Funny,"I've heard most of these songs on the radio, and for some reason most of them were funnier to me then.WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO ABOUT IT is funny, without question, but there's a newer version with French and Ebonics which is much, much funnier. I don't know whether that version appears on Phillips' other disk since I haven't bought it.SWEET BLOSSOM OF MINE is very funny, as is YOUR TAX DOLLARS AT WORK. These two, like What Do You Want, are intelligent humor songs, and the complex comment sung over the music are what make them so funny.I think some of my lack of responce to the other songs might have to do with the fact that some are studio tracks, and because sometimes the audience wasn't participating much. On other live versions I've heard on the radio, the live audience's reaction adds to the humor of the music, but that just isn't on this one much."
5,I LOVE HENRY,"I first bought this CD after watching his comedy show in West Hollywood many years ago. I let a friend borrow the CD & never saw it again. So, I had to get a new one & this time....no one will get to borrow it."
2,Wild Yam: Birth Control without Fear,"The information was ok and interesting but it was written by a layperson. There is no information about what species of wild yam was used, so people could use the non therapeutic one and wonder why they are getting pregnant. Also no information was given to how much milligrams of wild yam was in each capsule. A person could use a capsule that contains a smaller mg's of the product than this lady trialled while still consuming the number of capsules they recommended because the trials capsule were 200mg of wild yam where their's was only 150mg capsules. They may be potentially at risk of pregnancy. Therefore more research needs to be done to get the exact amount and species used. As a practitioner (Naturopath) I find this information very risky and contentious, however worth pursuing for further research...."
4,A Great Book: Me First,"Me First by Ellen Rudin is a terrific childrens book that teaches a very important lesson. When I was little my mom gave this book to me, mainly because one of the little pig's name in it was Betsy and that is my name too. This book is about two little pig sisters, Betsy and Bonnie, who play a game to see who can get certain things done first. Betsy starts to become very obsessed with the game and Bonnie becomes very sick of the game because of the way Betsy is acting. This book teaches a great lesson and helps children to understand the concept of not having to always come in first."
5,Great Music,I ordered this CD as a Christmas gift. The shipping was fast and the CD is absolutely wonderful. Michael Hedges was a true musician.
4,Good album.,This album features some of Mr. Hedges fine guitar work. More mature and choreographed sound than in Live on the Double Planet. Melencholy yet righteous overall feel. This album should not be forgotten.
4,Complete!,It is a complete book about Cardiac Anaesthesia. The problem is: when the book is puting in the market some aspect are not up to date!
1,Gilmore Hand Held Sprayer,"I ordered two of these Gilmore sprayers via Amazon and received promptly. Both units had air pressure leaks where the handle part of the unit screws onto the liquid holding portion; One sprayer air leaked moderately, the other unit air pressure leaked severely; I was barely able to use the moderately leaking unit to do a ""rush job"" by very frequent pumping. The severely leaking unit was not usable because it lost pressure so fast. I called Gilmore customer service and requested a new unit and was told I would be sent a new replacement sprayer if I would prove recent purchase by sending them a copy of the concerned invoice via email -- I did this and quickly received a new identical replacement sprayer. I immediately added pure water to the reservoir, operated the hand pump to pressurize, and immediately noted this new replacement sprayer also had a severe air pressure leak making it virtually unusable."
2,Gilmour sprayer,I thought this would be a stronger/more durable design. Same design of part I can find locally (Lowe's etc) and it would have been cheaper/faster. It takes a lot of pumping to get fluid flow and it leaks down fairly quickly. The primary leaks seem to be around the threads (as expected). I would not purchase this unit again.
5,excellent sprayer for our natural enzyme product,"We have used used these sprayers for a number of years for our business. Works great to spray a cleaning rag or cleaning mop rag with the natural enzyme product we use. It is only available at our local stores during the summer months so will order from Amazon so we can replace used sprayers year round.Don't know how the sprayer works for other jobs, but for us it is great!"
1,Complete garbage,"I bought one of these in October 2011 and it was DOA - never sprayed a drop.Fast forward to March 2012 and I still have some spraying to do. Searched Amazon for a sprayer and this came up again. I figured, what are the odds of getting two defective units? Well, the answer is 100% - arrived DOA.Bottom line - these are not sprayers; sprayers spray stuff, these do not. At best, these are 1.5 liter yellow jugs.So, if you are looking for a 1.5 liter yellow jug, these are great (except they are more difficult to use than traditional jugs)"
3,So so,"I bought two of these sprayers and one worked great, the other would spray but would also drip from the bottom of the nozzle. I tried everything and I couldn't stop it from dripping. Thankfully, Amazon is easy and they sent me a new one while the defective one was in transit. The replacement is just fine and doesn't drip. The spray is a very fine mist, which is good and bad, depending on what you are using it for."
3,OK for the money...,"Decent sound quality although I have noticed some slight buzz when no sound. There is pretty good noise isolation from the pads even without the canceling switched on. Not super comfortable for long wear, the band across the top of the head has a plastic pivot for the hinge and tends to sit right on the top of your head with no padding. Also the plastic on the head band/hinge feels a little cheap, I will be interested to see how long they hold up...*Update* Buzzing only happens when plugged into a PC. With iPod or speakers sound is more than adequate."
2,HUUUMMMMMM!!!!!!!,"The sound quality and the size is fine if you just want to listen to your tunes with them. The bad thing is that when you turn the ""sound cancelling"" thing on, there is a very noticeable hum. Are they trying to conceal the outside noise with inside noise???!!!"
1,Do Not Be Fooled,"I know it sounds great, folding, noise canceling,and everything, yet it doesn't do a good job of any of the things it boasts about.Couple of things why you shouldn't buy this.1. The Noise canceling doesn't work very well. One of the worst I've seen. It's not very well made because the noise canceling is suppose to only send out a certain amount of radio waves to block the ones coming in, and yet they made the noise canceling too loud and you can here the radio waves all too loudly.2. Very cheap material, it looks good in the picture, but the actual product doesn't look all that good.3. The ear part is the weirdest size. It doesn't go over the year and it just kind of squeezes your ears to stay on. It doesn't cover your ears very well.4. The head band is not round, it's square because of the folding option. You look goofy when you wear it, only wear it inside the house.5. You can't wear it for a very long time. It's not comfortable.Please do not buy this. For your own good."
3,iLuv 1901,I have owned the iLuv headspones for about a year now and have used them on airplanes and while cutting the yard on the weekends. The noise canceling feature is good but the top or bridge does not stay inplace. It seems to want to fold while still on your head. The earpeice could be a little bigger too. Sence I got them at a local discount store I am happy this the purchase.
1,Hurts your head,"I purchased these headphones as a gift. Didn't even get a chance to see if they really cancelled noise...the band that unfolded to hold the headphones on the top of the head was so hard and uncomfortable, you couldn't even wear it!I returned them immediately and purchased Philips noise-cancelling headphones with a behind-the-neck band. Much more comfortable."
1,"good design, bad for your ears",I think they did a genious design for the headphone (can be folded) but its too tight to your head and painful if you wear it for more tan 5 mins.The sound quality is very good
2,This meter is too complicated....,"I have been using a onetouch system for several years and like the memory and averaging functions. I thought I should replace my meter after three or so years and saw this meter and thought it would be an improvement on my record keeping. Wrongo! It keeps records based on the time of day, does not give you a before eating and after eating average, and has too many entries for food, exercise, medication, illness, etc. It makes assumptions about what meal you eat based on the time of day and is just too complicated. I am pretty tech savvy, so if I have trouble getting it to do what I need it to do...I wish I had just stuck with the regular onetouch meter. Blew forty bucks on this thing..."
2,not so good,"the screen blacks out after 10 minutes, so you constantly have to do a cold shutdown and restart. Great if you can use an alternate screen."
1,The most vile piece smut on the net,"Too horrible for mere words to do any justice!!!!!! The intellect of modern day America has sadly seen its peak with the postulations and hyperbole put forth by this untalented, third rate, poor excuse for a comedian."
2,No depth,"I was very disappointed while reading this book. There is no depth to the characters. While the sex scenes are graphic, the author used too many adjectives to describe what's happening. You feel like you are wading through the sex instead of flowing through and along with it. I couldn't even finish the book."
1,Does not recognize CD burner on my HP media center,My wife purchased this product for me for Christmas and I must say at first it looked extremely easy to use. However it would not recognize I had a DVD RW drive in my HP media center PC when every other application I have has no problem using it. For a CD burner it is pretty useless if it does not even recognise your drive as a burner. Then both my CD drive and DVD drive disappeared from my system (Not physically of course). The registry entries for them became corrupted. I had to do a complete rebuld of my system and it took me about 8 hours of time to get it back to a working state with my previously loaded software. I have deleted all traces of it and am taking it right back to the store.
1,Read,"Please read this review. description is Mis-leading. it says it fits split-limbs, but does not mention needing the $40.00 adapter,It is stated on the package thou. it also does not tell You that it will not work on crossbows."
1,Unsafe. Need I say more?,"I used this on my bow after tuning it down to ~60lb (+/- 5lb) of weight. Not even halfway into putting enough tension into the cables to reattach my strings, I heard a loud crack. I inspected my bow first, thinking that I may have cracked a limb. Fortunately, this wasn't the case. I then glanced at a section of the bow press cable. Several of the cable's fibers had snapped.I do not feel safe using this product, and I would rather not lose an eye when it snaps on me."
5,Better than expected...,"I was pretty skeptical before I ordered this bow press. (Even though the reviews for this type of press are very good. I was pleasantly suprised at the ease of use and the simplicity of this press. It is also very compact and lightweight. I have read a few negative reviews of people saying that it is hard to crank. I haven't noticed this at all! If you do any bow work on your own and don't want to spend a fortune on a bow press, this is for you."
5,great product,"Bought this press recently along with the Prototech Industries Inc Bowmaster Split Limb L Brackets Standard. The two items worked wonderfully together. Very safe and easy to use. I suggest not doing any type of work hastily since there are opportunities for misuse on both the brackets and the press. So double check your work and when you are actually putting pressure on the press, triple check. Overall great product."
3,Maori flavor,"If you can get your hands on a copy of this, do. Some of the stories from this are excerpted in ""The Vintage Book of International Lesbian Fiction"", and they inspired me to order a copy of this. I wasn't disappointed. Te Awekotuku's language is often strong and forceful, and her depictions of the lives of women in New Zealand are intriguing. Most of the stories center on the character of Tahuri, but not all."
1,The 1 in 101,Very simplistic and repetitive review. Basically only deals with epoxy glueing and that in only simple terms.Not recommended to anyone unless they have never glued anything with epoxy glue before.
1,A Very Forgettable book,"Having come across this book, I thought I would give it a try. Bad choice on my part. The characters are unbelievable, and the reader continues to think of them as someone in the author's imagination rather than real characters during the story. The author needs to 'know' his subject. With statements such as; ""... I learned that I acted instinctively like a real professional who always aims for the shooting hand with his first bullet, knowing that a dying man can still get off a shot at him."" Really! Give me a break. A 'professional' is not some John Wayne. A professional shoots for body mass and lots of it. The author has seen too many cowboy movies and totally spoiled this book from page 22 onwards. The characters are totally unbelievable. Not worth the read."
5,"Incredible, as always","As always, Jack Higgins is a quick and excellent read. This one introduces a new character, and is as pleasing as ever. Sean Dillon this new character is not, but I could certainly go far a dose of this character as an occasional break from Dillon. On another note, a novel with either Hannah Bernstein or Charles Ferguson as the main character would also be interesting, and no doubt entertaining with the dependably bard-like Higgins at the helm. While it certainly does not spark intellectual curiosity or cause one to ponder the state of man and/or society, that is perhaps simultaneously the beauty and appeal of Higgins' novels."
1,junk,i have had almosy every modle in the gilmore line. non have worked for over a year. the last one i got did not work out of the box. i am not one of these folks that has problems all the time. there produts are just junk. i got this modle last year and took it strait back to the store for refund.
2,plastic junk,"If you want a dependable sprinkler, stick to metal. I wish I had. I picked this one because you can adjust the spray width easily. However, you'll pay the piper for using plastic. The hose connection fitting will wear more easily and begin to leak. The arm movement will drive you to frustration. Sometimes it will follow the selected pattern; many times, however, it will not and you will have to rotate the selection knob again. Lastly, the width adjustment will begin to wear and will not lock in place. Bottom line: spend a few more bucks and go metal."
4,Tailor your watering area,"I love this sprinkler as one can tailor the area of watering very well. Both the controls - width and length of watering work very well and it is a life-saver as I do not believe in irrigation systems. The only drawback is that it takes a little time to get the hose connected to sprinkler. Also, the place for hose connection is made of plastic - that is where they generally break and become unusable - but that remains to be seen about the Gilmour!"
4,A trip worth taking,"This is one of the rare recordings in my collection that sweeps me away. Takes me to another place. And not only does each track stand on its own, the recording/songwriting is so well constructed that the entire CD is almost one composition. The thing that grabs me the most about this recording is not that the vocals are sparkling or the guitar is outstanding...but there is so much conviction that it almost overwhelms...buy!"
1,The worst?,"The only reason this novel had Dumas as its author was because it was signed so. Nowadays, very little (if any) evidence suggests that he was actually the author. At any rate this novel, which deals with a dumb but honest and strong hero while portraying Aramis (who was obviously the only one of the musketeers alive at the time) as the Evil Personified, is among the worst novels I have ever read untill the end."
4,impressive,This was purchased for a Good Friday Retreat. The students were awed and it provided a great teaching tool.
4,Crown of Thorns,"This was purchased for our church to remind us, as a previous reviewer has said, of Christ's suffering on the cross. It is authentic - which is appreciated - it adds to the visual impact.I cannot imagine anyone seriously considering this for a Hallowe'en costume. The thorns are real and the wearer would be able to feel the pain and experience the bloodshed. Go figure!"
1,blood everywhere,"I purchased this for a Halloween costume and after wearing it for half an hour, my hair was matted with blood. I would not recommend purchasing this for a costume."
2,Good Concept. Poor on details,"While I am totally in favor of the subject matter the title suggests, this book offers little science and its content is mostly ancedotes."
2,don't waste your money...,"I read Dr. Batmanghledg's first book ""Your body's many cries for water"". It was an excellent book!!!! So I was attracted to the title of this book ""Water cures: drugs kill""Great title!!! But lousy book. It's 100% testimonials...just several pages of his own words...all the testimonials are just ""rah rah rah"". I mean, it's helpful...but it was a waste of my money...just stick with his first book..."
3,a heart lifted,"this book basically review the information that already mentioned in the other books of Dr. Batman. however, It also contains many testimonies that give you more faith."
3,letters,had to dig to get more information. was not impressed by letter after letter. his earlier books are beter reads.
1,Disappointed,"I used to love Sennheiser headphones, so trying these made sense with my first MP3 player. For the money, they sounded quite good and fit fine. But the cable had a short at the plug which caused them to crackle and cut out whenever you moved. Exchanged them for another pair -- same exact problem. The cable seemed rather flimsy and cheap, and the way it twisted and turned up through the packaging put a lot of strain on the minimal strain relief (an obviously stupid configuration). Thought maybe my MP3 was the problem, but the headphones did the same thing connected to my PC. Even if they worked out of the box, I suspect they wouldn't have for long. Got a refund and bought some Bose (4 times the price, but they work). The 1 star is for the sound quality when there was sound, but the overall quality was poor. I expected more from Sennheiser."
2,"uncomfortable, sounds ok",These were purchased for my daughter and she is unhappy about the comfort and quality of the sound.
4,The best affordable headphones!,"This is a great pair of headphones these are some specific grades that I would give them:Bass 8.5sound quality 9confortable 10The only reason I don't give this headphones a 5 stars is because they are not as good as 200 dollars headphones. They come close, and they cost a quarter of the price."
1,Very mediocre,"I can honestly say by the amount of stellar reviews for these i thought they would sound a lot better. These headphones replaced a pair of koss ksc75 that sounded realy good but after over a year of daily use fell apart. That being said i paid fifteen dollars shipped for a refurb pair of these and i feel that they are worth about that much. In my opinion they're they are comfortable and isolate sound well. And aren't as fatiguing as the ksc75 and have better bass extension due to larger drivers, but the detail isn't very good. I would rate these 3 stars for the price i paid but i rated them 1 star to balance out all of the great reviews. don't pay anything over 15 for these. if you want better detail in the same price range get the Koss ksc75 igrado or koss portapro. if you don't care as much about detail and want decent bass and isolation these would be an good selection for the price mentioned."
4,"Not ""that"" great.","I bougth this headphones because of all the good reviews. And it turned out ok but not 'that' great and I won't use 'awesome' to descript the sound quality. It is a fine product for the price. But when sitting in front of my computer, I would rather use my ipod earbugs instead of this one."
5,Excellent Purchase,"I bought these headphones for a friend, and he loves them. Says he never knew his music could sound so good. I'm even planning to buy one of these for myself now. Great product, worth every cent."
5,Superlative..Excellent.. sound producing headphones,"Sennheiser, huh? The name sounded familiar to me. Then my memeory kicked in and I was reminded that indeed I had used Sennheiser products in the past. While studying to be a radio and tv audio engineer I had used the HD 414's and HD424's plus their top of the line microphone. German precision engineering for decades.I was looking for a set of headphones and I had tried SkullCandy, Philips, and Sony.All disappointments. By chance I was browsing Amazon and spotted the Sennheiser 150's for $27! I jumped on it. The sound was as advertised deep purring bass with select and distinct trebels. I listen to all types of music up to 2 hours at a time so I required sound quality and comfort. I believe I have found it in the Model 150."
4,Good for price,"These are very good, well fitting head phones. It would be nice if they had an in-line volume adjustment."
5,Awesome Headphones,"These headphones are a must-buy, if you are looking for a value for money kind of deal. I have been using them for 6 months now, and I am not so careful with them either. Yet, they have held up their sound. These headphones have held up very well against the very common problem of loose jacks and one ear side not working. A must buy for all music freaks."
4,SLENDED ITEM,"This headphone is nice and very comfortable when waring it, it has a lot of quality sound and therefore it's really a slended set of headphones for the low price."
2,"Decent sound, bad fit","These headphones have decent sound quality, but the size of the phones are very unnatural to fitting my ear (average male 6 feet tall)that coupled with an overly tight fit that cant be adjusted means that while I do like these headphones for a short time period because of the sound quality. It is not good at all for any extended use.I wouldn't recommend these to a friend simply because of the fit."
5,Awesome Music,This is my first review for amazon. This product is awesome. It is a steal for the price that it has been offered at.
4,Nice Headphones for the Money!,"I needed some headphones to do some personal editing from internet radio of a talk show with music. They do the job just fine. I do agree that the headset can get a little uncomfortable after 30 min. or so, I just take a break and get some coffee. I covered the ear cushions with 5"" sq. soft,light,cloth to keep the ear cushions from drying out too fast.I used rubber bands to hold the material in place. Does not look real great, but does the job for me.(Oily skin can make the material become stiff after a few years,or is that ears?) The cord length is approx. 10ft.and does not present any problems, being that it is rather thin, so handle with care!"
5,Worth every penny.,"This product is so awesome for its price. I'm somewhat an audiophile, but I know good headphones when I see them. The bass is very good. It's pounding on some songs. It does get a little uncomfortable, I must say, but after you take them off after an hour or more. While you're wearing them, you probably won't notice. Why pay more for others when you can bust out your spare change(compared to the 100+ headphones) and try these first? There's not much to lose, expect yourself in your own music in these babies."
4,"Awesome headphones, tad unconfortable","Just got these headphones today, Ive read reviews how the suck if you have a big head, and there extremely uncomfortable, but i find them pleasing. Put them on, plugged them into my i pod, and it was perfect! I have a huge head, and i find them uncomfortable, just a little tight on my head, but that's the only bad thing! Great sound, and base. If your having doubts cause of the uncomfortable reviews, don't listen to them, i think it works."
4,clicking noise can be reduced by adjusting equalizer music player,"These headphones are cheap and sound great. It cuts out external sound very well-when my friend set a bag of pasta on fire I could barely hear the fire alarm go off and my friend cursing and my room was right next to the kitchen! :p I've read in some reviews that there's a clicking noise, there is (at least on the computer) but I just started to adjust the equalizer (on itunes, haven't tried anything else) and it greatly reduced the clicking. It's still there occasionally but it's fine now. On itunes i set it to electronic? and increased the preamp from 0 dB to 1dB."
1,BAD FIT & CHEAPLY MADE,"Sennheiser should be known for their High-End Sound Head Phones. The EH-150 is clearly their entry product. They are uncomfortable to wear, since the foam presses against the ears - unless you have tiny ears. They look cheap = no golden connectors, cable is just a cheap long wire. FORGET ABOUT THEM and spend 40 bucks more and get their HD 280 PRO (those fit like a glove, are very well made, lasts forever AND sounds great) - I have two. ..."
4,Good headphones,I purchased these headphones for a friend for Christmas 2009 and he said they were very good - good sound quality and good quality overall. Fine purchase.
3,Not so great,I just purchase this headphone.. after one hour of use my ear where in pain.the sound is great but to keep them on your head for a long period of time is out of the question.save your money if you are looking for comfort..Last year I purchase from Radio Quack a a pair of headphone ( radio shack tatinium ) they are so comfortable that I even sleep with them. The sound quality is decent but the EH 150 evolution is much better.but if I had to choose I take comfort any day...thanksthanks
5,Awesome,The first ting ive noticed is that the quality of the sound is amazing. the bass is both soft and strong and the sound is very clear. the design is pretty good and is very light. My ears are a little bag but fit pretty well. the noise canceling is good too. I think this headphones is really good.
4,"Good Sound, Little Warm","These things sound great, well balanced, comfortable, good bass response.They are just a little warm for extended wearing periods. Make your ears sweat a little, or maybe I just have sweaty ears."
2,Not that great and its terribly small,Too small for my head and the ear muffs are too small for my ears and I'm pretty small like 5 feet 6 inches
2,Very Uncomfortable,"You might as well forget the concept of enjoying your music while you relax, as these are one pair of very uncomfortable headphones. As far as being able to adjust them for better fit, you can move the speakers up and down a bit so if you have a really long head it will be aligned with your ears, but the clamping action against your ears will still be there.I also did not find the sound quality to be anything that would set them apart. Can not say that I would recommend these based on that."
3,"Not the Best, But Then What Do You Expect?","These headphones are not the best. Trust me - I have heard better.But what do you expect for a $30 headphone?These are just temporary headphones while I am saving up for my very own Sennheiser HD 650. Now those, those are worth every penny."
1,All the sound in the world cannot make up for the lack of comfort,"Tremendous sound, etc., like everyone else says. However, it is absolutely unbearable to wear these headphones. At first you feel the pressure on your head like a clamp, and when that subsides you can't help but to notice that a fourth of your earlobe hangs outside of the hole provided for your ears.I know this sounds a little extreme, but honestly, as much as I enjoy the sound of these headphones, it is impossible to focus on listening for an extended period of time without your head hurting.I will soon be on the market for another more comfortable and more portable pair of headphones"
3,DON'T BUY if you intend to use them for your GUITAR AMP!,I bought these because of the amp adapter. I play guitar and need headphones. These sound horrible plugged into an amp. My amp is a Epiphone Triggerman DSP.
5,Def worth it.,"I run through headphones like water. These guys lasted me the longest. I bought them refurbished, so I don't know how much of a difference that makes, but I had them for a pretty long while...until my pet rat chewed a hole in the wire, and now I can only hear out of one ear. Augh.The bass is a little heavy, but I like that. It doesn't KILL sound outside of you, but it does muffle it. I like that, too. The music sounds crisp and clear and I don't have to put my hands over my ears like you do with the crappy over-the-heads.I'm def buying a new pair. I miss my guys already..."
3,adequate,"For the price, who can complain, however from the name Sennheiser I expected much more, the overbearing bass is deadening and if you adjust it changes the whole spectrum. I'm right back looking for headphones, just a little poorer but wiser."
5,I USE IT EVERY DAY!,The price was right! I don't know how you could pay hundreds more and get any better performance? I use them every day.
3,Try them on FIRST!!,"I bought these without trying them on first, which I'm sure a lot of folks do. Well don't. On almost every pair of Sennheiser headphones listed on Amazon there are a handful of reviews that say that the phones being reviewed fit too tightly and are uncomfortable. I went with the majority and paid no attention to these reviews and wish I had. I just got them and have had them on for about an hour. They felt fine at first and sounded decent too. But after about 45 minutes they just plain hurt. I've now had them OFF for about 15 minutes and my ears and head still hurt and I have a headache. (no the music was not THAT loud) These are obviously decent headphones, but just think about trying on some somewhere before spending the money."
3,"Great sound and design, but didn't last","I bought these for my PC and used them on my laptop, too. They were easy to adjust and fit well on my head, no matter what hairstyle I wore. I liked the near isolation and bass I got, so clear, I could hear the faint mistakes in songs (talking in the background, hitting noises). The extra-long cord was a bonus for my desk configuration and moving around for short distances while on the laptop.Too bad the things only lasted three months! I have never had a pair of headphones last more than year due to some wire disconnection. I was told if you wanted ones that last, you will have to spend nearly $300 at the low end. There has to be great quality headphones at a more reasonable price somewhere."
2,Sennheiser EH-150 Hi-Fi Stereo Headphones Too Small,"After trying on the earphones, I return them since they didn't fit properly over my ears causing discomfort. Because of this, they didn't block out the ambient noise as stated in the product description. I recommend visiting local electronics stores to try on the headphones before ordering them from Amazon."
3,Mediocre headphones - Expected better for cost,"They aren't overly expensive headphones but I still expected better for the cost. They work, they have a long cable and does dampen some ambient sound. On the other hand, the cans become constrictive and somewhat uncomfortable after a few hours and the sound isn't all that great either. The product description calls this perfect for ""serious musicians and professional DJs"" and someone ""who practically lives with a headphone"" over their ears---I seriously doubt both these assertions. I don't necessarily regret the purchase, but I would not choose to buy them again for my next earphones. You could probably go cheaper for the same quality or higher for much better."
2,Too small,"Sound is OK for the price, but they are very uncomfortable for an adult. They don't fit over the ears and are too tight. Cord is just the right length. Would be 4 stars if they were a little larger."
2,Much worse than expected based on other reviews,"I carefully selected these after reading many of the reviews and seeing the average review score was excellent,with cost fairly inexpensive. I was quickly dissapointed as I found the headphones to be uncorfortable and the sound was not very impressive. I then read some of the negative reviews and they are right on the mark. The headphones are too tight (and I have a small head), the cups don't fit over the ears; they give me a headache within 5 minutes. Not to mention, the sound is no better than my 5 year old, inexpensive Sony earphones. On top of all of this, the pair I received seemed to be defective as the right speaker hisses a lot. Plus they are a little bulkier than I expected."
3,Lows over represented and mid-high range thin,"These headphones sound OK. However, they over represent the lows and have a weak mid-high range. They are good for the office environment, but I'd say set your equalizer to compensate for the strange range on these cans."
5,Excellent headphones,"I've read the complaints about the tightness, and I don't notice it at all. I've got a relatively big head (size 7.5) and yes these are a little snug, but not at all to a point of discomfort. I actually like their snug fit. As for the sound, they're amazing. They definitely cover your entire ear and block out everything. I prefer listening to music this way where the sound is all-emcompassing. I had a pair of PX-200's which were nice, but you still hear people talking in the room, the tv, etc. I guess its a matter of preference. Anyways, these sound fantastic, and are EASILY worth the $24 or so. Highly recommended."
5,Love My Cans!!!,I wasn't expecting such clear sound coming out of these cans for the price I paid. They don't say they are noise cancelling but they are exceptional. Highy recommend.
2,Confirmed: for micro-ears only!,"I read all of the reviews for these headphones before I went ahead and decided to buy them and try them out. Many reviews commented how small they for normal-sized ears. I thought maybe they were wrong.I've 100% confirmed this... I have normal sized adult male ears the headphones 'sat' on about half my ears. The sound quality is incredible, but not if after an hour or two your ear hurts from being smashed.I do not recommend this product. I've returned them to Amazon. 2 stars for sound only, not fit."
5,Definitely one of the best for their price,"Pros - Best sound quality for their price, good isolation, cheap, just enough bass, comfort(read below).Cons - They're highly uncomfortable in the beginning. Just an hour of listening and it hurt. But I've had them for around 4-5 months now and these days I can wear them for hours and not feel a thing. They're extremely comfortable after you get used to them and they loosen up.They're fairly durable but be careful of the earpiece which slides up and down the main frame, you'll wear it out if you keep sliding it and they will just fall limply to the bottom.The cable is long, and if you don't have something to wrap it around, you'll tear your hair out in frustration - they keep getting tangled up.If you use equalizers or something similar to boost the bass, then there will be a noticeable distortion of sound. They're not meant for heavy bass.Sennheiser EH-150 Dynamic Sound Evolution Hi-Fi Stereo Headphones"
3,Yes ppl are right.,"I'm a female with an average head and ear size (I would like to believe).So the reviews saying these headphones hurt, I didn't think they would apply to me.I'm loving the design and the sound quality, but after having them on for 2 hours, my ears are killing me.I think the holes your ears are supposed to fit in the padding of the headphones are too small, even for an average ear sized female like me. After about 2 hours the pressure to the edge of my ears were unbearable and I had to take them off 'cause they REALLY hurt.I want to love this headphone, but I listen to music all day and all night. I would have to have them on for more than 2 hours straight. So I'm torn as to return them or not. Yes, would sacrifice sound quality or pay more for something that doesn't kill my ears."
4,Great Christmas Preset,"I bought this pair of headphones for my boyfriend for Christmas. I was looking for a great product for a great price and sure enough, the Sennheiser EH-150 Evolution Hi-Fi Stereo Headphones were just what I needed. They have great sound quality and the noise-cancellation is pretty good. They're not as impressive as a set of BOSE headphones, but they're pretty darn great for the price you pay. My boyfriend works in an office on Wall Street with 19 people in the same room, and he says they're perfect for tuning out office noise so that he can get his work done. He uses them for both his laptop and his iPod, and he's had them for almost a month now. His only complaint is that if he wears them too long, his ears get really warm and he has to take them off for a few minutes; hence the 4 star rating. Overall, I'm a very happy customer."
4,Good value,The phones are a very good value for the cost. I only use them for watching TV. My husband has a larger size head and says they are tight and do get a little uncomfortable after an hour.
4,Great Headphone!!!,"I just received my headphone today. overall, it is a great item for the price i paid. Sound quality is above average but not the best out there. Design is very nice. Good enough for casual user to listen to music or game. I gave it four stars because this head phone is NOT recommend for people who wear glasses.It is quite uncomfortable, however when i dont wear glasses and listen to this headphone, it is very good. IMO!"
2,Get what you pay for,"I shouldn't have expected much for the $15 I paid for these, but still I was disappointed that a full over-the-ear headphone from a storied manufacturer like Sennheiser could deliver such poor sound. The highs are tinny and strained, the midrange is non-existent, and the bass is overboosted and artificial-sounding. I've heard iPod earbuds that sounded better than these cans."
1,Below average,"The headphones are too small for an adult's ears. The sound is just OK, I wouldn't buy again."
5,Great sounding headphones at a great (refurb) price,These headphones sound great. I wanted to be some more enclosed headphones for my listening to my mp3 player. These did the job and at a very nice price. They're refurbished but look and sound like new.
5,a great little find,These headphones are the perfect answer for what I thought was going to be a long search for a comfortable fit and quality sound for a reasonable cost. Here they are. It's got good sound. It's got the punch yet the subtle clarity for both the music and DVD playback that my computer demands.I previously had a slightly larger pair of headphones (or 'cans') that I was content with for three years prior. I got these EH-150's and I was slightly suspicious with the smaller size earcups. But an immediate run through have put my fears to rest. I paid less money for better performance. Go figure. Plus my bald noggin was appreciative of the padding on top instead of strips of plastic digging a channel through the top of my head.I'm thinking of getting a few more pair while they are hot.
4,Great headphones,"I read many of the other reviews before purchasing and was a little hesitant about the complaint about being uncomfortable on the ears. They fit great, no discomfort and the sound is really good. They sure shut out the rest of the world."
3,"Great sound, for awhile...","Music is my passion, and so I needed a good set of headphones mostly for the computer. This is where I usually listen to CD's, which seem to arrive weekly! The sound was great, blocked out most of the TV which is in the same room. But within a year, they stopped giving me stereo. For the price (actually paid the $59 price ) it was OK, a great experience but my next set will be different."
5,Sennheiser Roules!,"this headphones are awesome!It's a german company of electronics which was founded in 1945.In 1980, the company entered the aviation market, suppling Lufthansa with headsets..impresive,aaaaaa?"
3,Small Ear Cup,"Great sounding headset for the price. The ear cups, while nicely padded, only sit on the ear and do not surround the ear like some headsets do. They are not something that could be worn for a long duration (over an hour) unless you have really tiny ears."
2,Not Much,You get what you pay for. I really did not expect to much for the price and I did not get it. My bad.Spend a little more money and get something a little better.
4,"Sound great, could use as a noose.","I think these sound great and for fairly cheap headphones i cant complain. with that being said i would not have bought these had i known the cord was so long. my fault, should checked the details. DUH DUMBASS. a shorter or retractable cord woulda been nice. if i go running or walking i have too much slack and tying it up is downright ugly and adds weight."
4,Great Value,Best cans I've ever had for the price. Ear pieces could be just a bit larger. Super long cord. I am very pleased with the sound quality.
2,HOT Ears,The only problem I have with these is fit. There is no adjustment except for up or down on ear phone. They are tight and therefore ny ears sweat!
5,"""Picture-Perfect"" Monitor","This monitor is the greatest monitor I have ever seen. From the extremely fine display to the way it blends seemlessly with the rest of the decor. The best part is when there is only a picture on the screen, it looks so much like a picture in a frame that I want to hang it on the wall. A true 5-Star monitor!"
5,my beautiful 17 inch NEC LCD,"I got my MultiSync LCD-1765 about half a year ago and it is so nice. It sits on my desk, freeing up tonnes of room for my keyboard which is always nice. It is built very sturdy, which in my opinion is a good thing. It looks bigger than it really is, says most people. I play quake3 Rocket Arena on it all the time and its quite fine. It turns off and on in less than a second, which is faster than some CRTs I know. It is one of the best LCDs I have come across so far. NEC is a good brand to trust. It matches my grey logitech MX700 wireless mouse. I gave it 5 stars because I have found absolutely no fault with it."
5,Just dusted this old thing off!,"I bought this back in '04 for a pretty penny and used it for 4 years until I got a 17"" laptop. I put this away. I just busted it out for dual monitors and wow! The colors are amazing. I forgot how great this was. I'm more impressed than ever."
3,Video is disappointing; Audio is wonderful.,"I remembered seeing the television show many years ago and when I looked it up on the Internet, Amazon.com came up with this CD. I ordered a few copies of this item for various family members after a very animated discussion on Christmas Eve -- some folks said it was crazy to think that these two artists would sing together and thought that the two voices had been recorded separately! Anyway, we were all very disappointed when the video could only be played on a PC. We all had assumed that this would be a DVD quality movie. It should be! I would gladly pay many times the price for a better video. The PC video version is only about 4""x5"" and looses resolution rapidly if you try to enlarge it. The audio is worth it, though we were expecting a double-bonus with the video and it didn't work out that way."
1,Not what it says it is,"While the description says there is a video, there is not. It is just the song. Download the song and save yourself time and money."
1,Save your money,There is ONE song on this CD! It is supposed have a vidio portion. I challenge you to get this to work on any DVD player or computer. The only computer that has the capability of playing this CD has to have QT32.exe. There are absolutely no guarantees with this CD and there is no way to get help. This gem is an antique!
1,"good song but only one song on the cd, too short",I looked all over for this duet and was somewhat disappointed that I paid over $10 for one 4 minute 22 second song. I thought it was a whole cd of Bing Crosby and David Bowie. At the very least the song should have been repeated for the whole cd.
4,"Nostalgic, not audiophile...","This CD sounds like it came straight off the video - dialogue and all. That's kind of nice for the nostalgia of it, but it's not the kind of crystal clear production you'd get nowadays. Just warning you...But that was typical in those days, and in the end it's great content."
5,"Pretty tune, isn't it?","This is the legendary David Bowie & Bing Crosby duet of ""Peace on Earth/Little Drummer Boy"". It was originally performed on the 1977 Christmas Special ""Bing Crosby's Merrie Olde Christmas"". That was Bing's last TV Special before he passed away. The track here includes the dialogue spoken between Bing & Bowie before they break into the song, as well as the song itself. The dialogue is pretty corny, but charming. The song is great, which you already know if you've heard it."
5,pop meets classic,This pop meets classic crooner duet proves even in a time of music turmoil that music genres can put their artistic differences aside in this beautiful rendition of a classic holiday song bringing back the spirit of Christmas year after year.
4,Peace On Earth / Little Drummer Boy,Great holiday song; doesn't get radio airtime it deserves. Trying to find the score for this arrangement for a church duet. Any help would be appreciated!
5,Love it!,This is my all-time favorite Christmas song! It's absolutely beautiful. David Bowe and Bing Crosby are an unlikely but talented duo. They created a striking and heartwarming rendition... one that I truly look forward to hearing every holiday season.
5,Great Song and Singers,"Although the quality of the original video could be better, the DVD and sound quality are excellent. Given the quality of the performers, the song is truly a Christmas classic, well worth playing repeatedly. I bought the music score separately and love to sing it as a Christmas duet."
4,Getting the Video to play!,"This is a great song and worthy of purchasing. The video does work the key is to ignore the ""quick time"" player and all others associated with the CD. If you have Real Player on your computer put the CD in your computer when it asks what to play the CD with close the program. Go to the 'start"" button on the taskbar click on ""run"" ""Browse"" change from ""programs"" on the bottom to ""all Files"" choose select program from list pick ""real Player press the start button poor video & out of synch but it is a classic song from the past Matt"
3,oldie but a true goodie,This song is my all time favorite holiday song. I had been looking for this particular duet between David Bowie and Bing Crosby since I had seen the original showing on TV. I was some what disappointed that it was the whole scene with the talking & swopping stories before the song but the song itself is superb. To mix the two styles and eras of singers was genius.
1,"Wrong Item! advertised and sold, TWICE!!!",They can't ship the right product on TWO TRIES. Do not do business with Amazon for this item. Buy it elsewhere if you want what is advertised. VERY bad Experience.
5,plaisirs d'amour,"such a wonderful music! you'll be jumped in a real introspective world, i recommend it for real dreamers!!"
3,Follow up,Hi... I recently ordered and recieved this item and to be presented as a gift. I was considerably disapointed with both the product as well as the presentation. I promly wrote a review and within 2 days I was contacted by a company ...JJ Artisans...representative. She was very apologetic and made a refund to my account as well as an offer to keep the item. I am quite impressed by their resolution of the problem and would consider purchasing from them in the future.
3,Old arguments,"In reading this book I was very impressed with Dr. Habermas' writings, however it was the opposite with Dr. Moreland. He tries to offer a logical argument for dualism, which is a dead idea. I feel that as Christians we need to get away from the philosophy of Plato and his body/soul distiction. also the use of NDE's in this book is a horrible argument and most of the scientific world laughs out loud at these ideas. I recommed for the philosophical mind that you read Richard Rorty's Objectivism, Relativism and Truth essay on Non-Reductive Physicalism. This is the direction Christianity has to go if it is going to continue to live."
4,Not as good as the first Montrose tape!,"So don't get your hopes up, cheese. But these guys seriously rock and you should pick this muther up."
1,"Looks good, functions poorly","Was planning on using this for a 48 hour trip. I tried, but the shoulder strap broke and then the handles broke within 6 hours of actual use.I had to replace it on the fly because there was no way to carry it at that point. It looked good, but the quality is crap."
5,A perfect gift,"This bag was another gift for my boyfriend and its absolutely perfect for his overnight business trips. It looks presentable, fits quite a lot of clothes and other items and its very reasonably priced. I did not notice any leather smell upon opening it and the leather is quite good so I have no complaints about the bag. I would honestly travel with it myself so overall a great purchase. And he really likes it too!"
4,Good bag but has a very leather smell,I bought this bag because it was leather. I didn't expect it to smell like a baseball glove. The smell will go away in time and it's still a nice bag.
3,"Nice bag, but the shoulder strap broke.","The bag great size, well designed, loved the outside pockets. And for the most part seems well made.Unfortunately, the first time I used it the shoulder strap broke. I did not have that much stulf in it...a large snow globe I had bought as a gift a couple of shirts and socks, toiletries, an ebook and a 7' tabloid computer and a large sandwitch. Not an excessive amount of weight at all. I was walking around a lot with it.I was able to remount the strap by punching a hole in a strong part of the leather, and used it for a couple of trips since, without a problem."
4,But I will keep it!,"This is not the bag shown in the picture nor is it the one described in the write up. I gave it 4 stars because of the falseness in the advertising.That said, whatever it is, is a nice product and will serve the needs for which I purchased it.I won't be using it until September. We shall see if it holds up on a 28 day cross country trip."
3,Bueno para el precio,"Este bolso es bueno para su precio, lo encontr√© que tiene buen tama√±o y no pesa tanto.Excelente para viajes y llevarlo a las excursiones"
4,Patchwork leather bag,"This bag looks good, is real leather, and seems to be holding up rather well. It's also a great size for a carry on bag. It did have a strong leather smell, but it has since faded."
1,beware,This item smells bad and was supposed to be new.it was scratched and worn in placesLeather seems more like vinyl with leather trim
5,Great looking bag for any price!,"We received this bag today and it is a great looking lined black leather bag and shipping was included in the price that I thought was already pretty low for an expensive looking,well made bag.that is just perfect for our needs. Some people have said there is an overpowering smell to the bag but we do not find this to be so and we find the straps to be quite sturdy too. Will write more if there are any problems after using for a while."
2,Too Small,"I measured the bag when it arrived, because it just did not look like the right size. When I measured it was about 2 inches short. Appeared to be made OK. Others have reported a bad smell....this only smelled like natural leather. It looked OK.....it was just not the size they advertised. I sent it back the next day."
4,"Excellent, cheap, and portable","This is the ideal carry on for short trips and travel. I used it on a 5 day jaunt to Mexico and to put all manner of items in for visiting friends and relatives on weekends. Its a great size, big but not too big to be a full size bag. It can be a carry-on for flying. It fits a lot of stuff, and is durable. It is real leather, but its complete nonsense what some other reviewers are saying about the smell. It smells like leather, that's it. End of story. If you don't like leather and its smell for some reason buy something else. But its hardly a matter of major concern. The large strap is a bit weak, but the other two are well built, and I would've liked to see a different zipper mechanism (its a double zip held at the end with velcro) but overall a great buy for a great price."
4,Lowrance H2O C,"Purchased this unit so I could find some streets on a trip to the South. This unit is better utilized in a camping or hiking mode. It does not plot a trail to an address using a street structure. It will plot a trail, but is as ""the bird flies"". It does have excellent battery life, and the power point adapter included is great. Buy the Plus unit because you get the mapping software and an MMC card which you will need. The built in map is only good down to 8 miles zoom in. Anything closer and you will need to have created a custom map. Quality is excellent, as is my experience with Lowrance. The mapping software is also excellent. This unit will work great in my boat as well. Mapping software is also excellent and easy to use with unit. Overall I am happy with it."
1,Other Bad Reviews Are Correct!,"I purchased this item several weeks ago excited about the Plus Package with mapping software, memory card, and memory card reader. I had received the item quickly but had quickly found that I had received the standard model and got in contact with Amazon. After speaking with them for almost an hour, the lady had told me that she was sending me a replacement with the CORRECT items. This was made clear and I needed to then return the item I had received. FIVE DAYS LATER, I received the EXACT SAME THING I had received before. Standard item with no plus package. I had called again and after a long explanation of them confused about their own explanation on the website I asked for a refund. Now a few days before my fishing trip I am without a GPS with mapping software that I was needing. Terrible customer service, and she let me know that i wouldn't receive my money for probably a week. Never buying again....."
1,"H20C, one star because you can't give it no star","I have an iFinder H20C which I received for Christmas last year. It has operated MAYBE 12 hours and now has quit working, the satellite location does not translate to the map page. Several resets later it still doesn't work.I enquired by email a month ago about service after spending the afternoon on the phone to no avail.Today I received a reply. Lowrance wants a flat $149.95 plus $12.50 shipping and handling to repair the unit.I am replacing the unit with a Garmin./s/L. C. Clower"
5,A Great Read,"I `ve been reading this book with great enjoyment and interest, taking time to do the incremental exercises, although the temptation is to rush ahead! It's very satisfying, solid, thorough and well-organized, with a nice mix of attention to detail and ability to hold the bigger picture, and a sense of the author's depth, experience and humanity sustaining it all. I appreciate the careful crafting of the methods used and patient attentiveness to make sure that it all supports sanity, and not adding to the hubris and inflation that can easily occur when people think about working with their own self-concept."
4,Blade,I purchased the blade to replace the orginal blade. Had no problem with the blade. I only do smaller limbs (4 inches or so).
4,Great folk CD.,"This is a great CD if you like laid back folk type music. The songs are original and catchy, and the lyrics have great meaning.Definately worth the price, and more!"
3,Indeed a good read.,"Let me quote an early assessment by the author himself. It is classic. To wit: ""This book deals with an unknown author writing about a little-known college having a losing season in a minor sport played by women."" I need add only that it is, indeed, a good read."
5,The perfect platinum band!,"My husband bought this band for me for our anniversary and I love it! It was exactly what I wanted...something that I could wear all the time, even while at the gym, traveling, washing dishes, in the yard, etc. The band is the perfect width (2.5mm) and very comfortable. Despite the heavy weight of platinum I forget that I'm even wearing this ring. The comfort fit is awesome-it's super comfy and the slightly rounded edge is very pretty. The inside engraving reads ""PLAT 950"", nothing else. You won't be disappointed with this ring, especially for the price. (Our local jeweler couldn't find one for less than $800.)"
5,Encyclopedic!,"Excellently written second tome in a series of 4 volumes of the great guinness encyclopedia of music. It is of course somewhat dated now but it contains ultra-extensive information that you will find nowhere else. This tops all other avalable reference books be it by Rolling Stone, Trouser Press or even the AllMusic books (who are great but amateurishly written). There is omething about British rock journalism that cannot be really defined and that makes it superoir: they take the music seriously 8as do their american counterparts) but somehow they write better."
2,My wife bought a new pair of beige shoes . . .,"but she couldn't find a bag to match. I thought $45,021.00 was a little steep for New Image Mini Drainable 9"" Pouch that had Color Match: Green - Beige - Box, so I bought a box of used ones for $28,451.78.She was excited to finally find a bag that matched her shoes, but Hollister hadn't drained them, and their claim of odor-free pouches was not true."
5,A Bible for Grief/ Yours and Theirs!,"This book could easily be called a bible given the depth, breadth and soulfulness of its content. Dr. Jeffreys speaks of the need for the care provider to communicate from the head, hand and heart, and he does just that in this book. It is rare to find a text so full of relevant information, well organized, well presented, and at the same time nurturing the heart of the reader. This makes for an amazing experience. The care provider leaves this book with heightened empathy, with increased love of self and of fellow man, what a unique gift! I have been in practice over 25 years as a psychologist with a specialty in grief, loss, and trauma. I trained with the senior staff of Elizabeth Kubler Ross, MD and I find Dr. Jeffrey's book to be the most comprehensive writing I have ever encountered on this topic. I highly recommend it for everyone, the professional, the friend or family member and each individual, for we are all grieving people at some time , arn't we?"
3,Tape Measure Review,"My kids enjoy playing with this tape measure, but sometimes they play with it the wrong way. They'll pull the tape all the way out with one child holding one end and one child holding another end and run around the house. The beginning of the tape already ripped within the first two months, but I taped it up and it's fine. It's mostly for them to have fun measuring things and I couldn't find anything in the stores."
3,"Great shut off, flow not stronger than my multi spray pattern nozzle.","The plus: The smooth operating lever creates a linear increase in water flow and a complete shut off. It's also reliable: I had left it on my hose and forgot to shut off the water supply --- for two months. When I came outside, there wasn't as much as a single drip from the nozzle and when I pushed the lever to the open position, it delivered a steady, powerful stream. Now, the negative. I was looking for a nozzle that would [hopefully] create a small stream that by hydrodynamics would create a stronger/longer flow of water than a conventional nozzle. Sigh, it was just about the same as my regular multi-pattern nozzle. In other words, I don't need this nozzle, even though it is very well built."
3,"Some good gems, but my least favorite of series","There are some good moments on this one, but this is my least favorite of Winter Solstice series. I think Windham Hill did return to form & quality with their next offering, ""A Winter Solstice Reunion"". This one opens with an uncharacteristically ""smooth-jazz"" piece called ""Joyful Times"".""Yesterday's Rain"" & ""Snow Dance"" are pleasant, but to my ears they are in a similar vein. (Perhaps more New Age-like). And ""Western Sky"" is similarly pretty, but at nearly seven minutes, it becomes a bit long & repetitive. This is the most uneven disc to date. The earlier discs contained quiet, often acoustic pieces that weren't quite as slickly (over) produced. Most likely this reflects the departure of Will Ackerman a few years before, and I believe Dawn Atkinson may not have worked on this one either though I may be mistaken. There are still some great gems here, such as Michael Hedges' ""Ursa Major"", Liz Story's ""Snowfall"" & Tim Story's great contributions ."
2,Nope!,"I've got ancient, original copies of Winter's Solstice I, II, and III. Excellent works all, and brought out regularly to celebrate that season. This one, however, evoked no such seasonal feelings. Rather it seemed to be a random compilation of Windham Hill music. Hugely disappointing. Get any or all of the first three in this series, but pass on this one."
4,"My favorite ""Winter Solstice"" cd","I own Windham Hill's ""Winter Solstice IV"" and I must say I prefer ""Winter Solstice VI"". It is for those who like their Christmas music on a quieter register. Beautiful instrumentals and blissfully peaceful."
2,Enough already!!,"I have all of the Solstice releases. This will be the last I buy. It sounds more like the ""Easy Listening Jazz"" FM stations that are franchised around the country than Christmas. I used to put the CD's on at night with the tree lights on, house lights off and the snow falling outside. The collections were a perfect blend of ambient mood and beautiful sounds that REALLY sounded like a secular holiday moment. I was convinced they would be the new sound track of the Holiday's. A good thing has gone too far and is no surprise that Windham Hill not really being Windham Hill anymore would drop the ball."
5,Love it,"Great pack of movies, love it. Purchased it for a gift. Arrived quickler than expected and was well packaged for protection."
5,Look no further than within for the resources of your soul.,John's book is a powerful story filled with inspiration and insight into the spiritual path. He takes the reader on a personal journey through the field of infinite possibilities into self-discovery and fulfillment. A happier and healthier planet is within our grasp as each individual awakens to their own hero's journey.

ALL AND ALL A GOOD CD. BUY IT"
4,"Nice plates, but not perfect","Overall I was pleased with the set. The design is quite pretty and looks good in person. There were however a couple of surprises when I opened up the set: there is no pattern on the bowl beyond the color of the rim, and the small plates are actually quite large (nearly the size of the full plates they were replacing). That's not to say these were bad surprises, but it's worth knowing.The main reason this set didn't get 5 stars was that some of the plates we received were a little warped around the edges, nothing too bad, but quite noticeable when they are all stacked, not what you'd expect from something branded as a premium ""ultra"" product."
2,snoww3,"The violin came very fast, but the color displayed on amazon is deceiving. The violin is not as blue as it looks in the picture, but is more of a light torquoise. I have been unable to get ahold of Gracemall to discuss exchanging for another color. It is very difficult to find contact info to talk to someone. This was a Christmas present for a little girl who was disappointed by the ugly color and now it looks as though it cannot be exchanged. Anyone have any ideas on how to get ahold of Gracemall? Amazon seems to not want to give any info about them on the website."
3,Not a long-term investment.,"We bought these nightstands for our bedroom which is decorated in dark espresso colored woods. The picture shown at the time did not reflect the true color of the stands we received which we expected would be a dark brown. Although the model we bought was named dark cherry, the actual color is typical of a medium cherry shade. The wood is extremely soft and showed dents/nicks from regular use within the first few months. This is a fine purchase for a starter home or for a young couple on a budget, but I do not recommend these stands as a long term investment. I highly doubt we'll take these with us on our next move. The knobs are cheap looking (we tossed them right away) so I would recommend you replace them with a more modern alternative from your local hardware store."
5,Sure-fire sleepy time soundtrack,"I can't guarantee that your children will zonk out within 60 seconds of your hitting the ""Play"" button, but I can assure you that parents will enjoy the music as much as children will. And I would say it will probably take many more listenings for you to get completely sick of it, compared with the more saccharin options on the market. It is a lovely collection, diverse enough to make it interesting through-out, not at all repetitive. At the same time a quiet mood is maintained and each track follows easily upon the one before. One other thing I like about it is that we've gotten many years of use out of it--our oldest son (he's 7) has heard it since he was a baby and still enjoys hearing it."
4,"LOVED the instrumentals, vocals so-so","From 3mo's - 13mo's my daughter LOVES this album (and so do I). 1/2 of the 17 songs are instrumental and 1/2 are sung in various languages. I prefer the instrumentals. The music sets the perfect mood to create a relaxing atmosphere. I haven't grown tired of the songs after MUCH repetition and actually find myself humming the tunes when the CD is NOT playing. Get this CD, you'll enjoy it."
5,Superb mix of melodies appropriate for all ages,"This compilation features music sounds from around the world--both familiar and new. The melodies are catchy, and we find ourselves humming them throughout the day, especially Common Threads, by Bobby McFerrin. Best of all, it's a great stress-reducing, going to bed CD. Absolutely would recommend this to everyone who loves soft, alternative music."
5,Heavy artillery for calming baby,"We are new parents of a five-month-old, and we expose her to a lot of music, sometimes because it's music, and sometimes to calm her. This album has become our heavy artillery for helping put her to sleep. Highly recommended for this purpose. I wish there was a Starry Night 2!I have to add to my previous comments--I made it sound like the only merit of this music was that it helps put the baby to sleep. Actually, the music is very nice. It's not what I would normally choose for myself, but it is always pleasant to hear, and most incredibly, even after hearing it a million times, I have not gotten tired of it! I suspect that many people without babies would just enjoy listening to it."
5,We all love this!,Our daughter still sleeps in our room. She listens to this during her bedtime routine and falls asleep listening to it. Even my husband likes to leave this CD on as we go to bed hours later - it's so soothing! Very mellow. Beautiful sounds.
5,"Soothing, dreamy music!","I just had to write a review of this cd. It was recommended to me by another mother, and I tried it and love it! We like to listen to it in the living room as nap time approaches, nursing with the lights dimmed. With the fan going and this cd on quietly, both momma and baby start drifting off to sleep. It's absolutely wonderful, and I recommend it to anyone who needs some instant R&R."
5,"Magic - the more you listen, the more it grows on you.",No question this CD was a labor of love for the international group of performers. We have loved listening to it and reading the notes. You don't have to be a lullaby fan to enjoy these.
5,Our Child's Favorite,"Our little angel gets rocked to sleep three times a day to this CD. She falls asleep in a matter of minutes. We take it on trips, in the car, etc. I don't know what we'd do without it."
1,THIS IS LOAD OF SH - T,THIS IS A SAD OFFERING. I SAW THE BAND LIVE AT THE VICTORIA APLLO (76) LIECHESTER SQ BALLROOM (77) THE MUSIC MACHINE (78) REAL SAILOR FANS PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY .
4,I've just finished teaching with this one--,"--and, as some have said, it _does_ lack a number of things you'd like to have. But it's hard to blame W.W. Norton (as one poster does) for the shortage of Hemingway and Fitzgerald when the real culprit is Scribner's, which gives anthologists extremely limited rights: one story from each writer. (The writer's original publisher is also to blame for the amount of T.S. Eliot here: no more than 1000 lines allowed.)One more thing: I'm ditching this in the future for texts with fewer footnotes. _Norton_ needs to avoid overdetermining readers' responses with interpretive notes."
2,The great Timi Yuro sounds old,"My wife and I both loved the original dynamic voice and sounds of Timi Yuro. In fact we listened to some original LP albums over the holidays and decided to buy a CD. On this particular CD she sounds like she is 65 years old. The dynamic voice and emotion are NOT there. I don't know if the recording on this particular CD is the problem or what, but we were very disappointed when we listened to it. We still love Time Yuro but this CD did not deliver."
5,Can't leave home without,"After seeing other parents children sit in the grocery charts coughing and sneezing all over the handles I knew that I did not want my daughter to touch that! So I began a search to find something that would fit in the grocery cart to keep her free of those ""other kids"" germs. That is when I found the Floppy Seat. This has been wonderful, my daughter turns a year old in a week and had only been sick twice with a cold. I know this has helped cut down on her exposure to germs that others leave behind. I have nothing but great things to say about this product and that it is a must have for any mom no matter how old your kids are!"
5,How did I live without this?,"I bought this for our 5th son. I had never seen one before. We started using it when he was about 7 months old and it is fantastic! It is so cushy that it covers the whole high chair or shopping cart seat and he can lean his head on it if he's tired. It has a strap that you attach to the cart or chair and then buckle around the baby. It has a little pocket and it has loops so you can attach toys. It then folds into itself to make a bag with handles. I feel so great having him sit on this because it protects him from touching all the germs and he's comfortable. I read a review that said that you can't put it on with one hand (while you're holding the baby). That is definitely true, but I've been able to work around that. Once you get the baby in there it's definitely worth it!"
5,GET THIS! You need it!,This was a wonderful idea! It works great and is easy to use! A must for all moms who want to protect their children from as many germs as possible! Washes easy!
5,mom of a teether,"I love this item, especially now that my son is teething. I have seen a few moms with different styles. I like this one because it fits around the whole shopping cart/highchair. With all the germs around, I feel like this is safe for my teething baby"
4,Everybody with a child should have this,"i love the floppy seat. it is easily put onto the shopping cart, fits any size of cart (even the huge costco ones), covers everything baby touches has a seatbelt that works great and is very soft and comfy.the reason i gave it just four stars is that the fabricd fades quickly. couple times of washing it and the fading starts. the second thing i wish is that they had some hipper fabrics, like pink camo, or some retro look."
5,Should be considered a necessity!,"I love this product! I had originally bought another cart cover that was less expensive, had toys and seemed good enough. But no way, it didn't fit most carts and didn't cover the sides. My son would search for the metal to chew on. YUCK! So I spent the money on this one and don't regret a dime. It even covers the push bar of the cart so my hands can stay clean. With just a bit of practice, its easy to put on and take off. While the padding is nice, it can be bulky to store."
5,A MUST HAVE !!!,"After purchasing another grocery cart that we were horribly unsatisfied with, my husband and I purchased this one from Babies R Us. It's wonderful!! It's a breeze to attach to a cart or highchair and it provides all the necessary safety from our little man and the germ covered carts & highchairs. Don't even consider buying another grocery cart cover. This is the only one you'll ever need!!"
1,Not Happy with the Floppy Seat,"I personally was not happy with the Floppy Seat. I do not like the way it moved around in the cart & it was not convenient to store. I then purchased the Buggy Bagg & was extremely happy with that product. The padding, convenience & features of the Buggy Bagg were far more superior than the Floppy Seat. I would like to see Toys R Us carry the Buggy Bagg. It is the absolute best."
5,Best baby gift I received...,"I received this cover for a shower gift. It has been the best baby product I have. I read that it doesn't wash well, however I have had no trouble with mine. I haven't dried it in a dryer, though. I pop it into the washing machine at night and hang it on something to dry before I go to bed. It is dry and perfect for leaving in the morning. The only times my daughter has gotten really sick is when we HAVEN'T used this seat cover. It was great when she was learning to sit as well. I was easily able to bunch it up in the right places to give her some support to sit. Our daughter is currently about to turn 2 and I still use it in grocery carts and occassionally in highchairs. We also found that it was harder for her to squirm out of the seat with the cover around her."
2,This cover not very practical,"I bought this floppy after reading lots of good reviews about it and I definetely wanted something to cover both shopping cart and high chair. After using it numerous times, I decided I don't like it very much. Yes, it's great to have this to cover and it's a two-in-one. However, I find it way too bulky for normal restaurant high chairs. I always have a hard time putting in on the chair and then trying to get the baby in. And since it's so bulky it doesn't stay in place well at all until the baby sits in it. Then there is no way to put this on either high chair or shopping cart with one hand. So I always have to put the baby down.In the end I wish I would have bought two covers, one for the high chair and one for the shopping cart. Now, I will just buy one for the chair, and use this one just for the shopping cart (since I already paid for it).So I would not recommend this cover if it's to be used for chairs and carts."
5,Love this Floppy Seat,"I purchased this for my daughter when she began sitting upright in shopping carriages. I could not stand the thought of her touching anything with all those germs. I previously had a cheaper version made by Infantino that I purchased from another store, but was not at all happy with it. It did not cover the entire surface of the carriage and my daughter always managed to touch the one spot that was not protected. I then purchased the Floppy and could not be happier. Its generous size covers the entire surface of every carriage I have encountered. The plush material also makes for a comfy ride. She is nearly 3 and I still use it all the time. It washes well and folds up compact. Well worth it and a must for every baby registry."
1,Research all of your options...,"I bought a floppy seat because my sister had one and she loves it. However, I didn't really like it because it's too big and cumbersome. The leg holes are too big and it leaves a lot of the cart exposed there, which of course is where my daughter wants to touch. This defeats the purpose of the cover. Also, it is very cumbersome and takes two hands to get it on the cart and forget about putting it in the bag unless your hands are totally free. I tried it in 3 different shopping carts and while it fit it left a lot of cart exposed through the leg holes. Needless to say I returned mine and got a Buggy Bagg instead. That thing is great. My daughter fell asleep today in the grocery store in it! It's so easy to use and fold up too. It is more expensive but totally worth the money. My advice would be to do your research before you buy."
4,Floppy Seat Cover,"I am very pleased to have purchased this item. It is all that the manufacturer said it would be. However, if I had to say anything negative about it is that it is a bit troublesome to try and unfold it or put into place in the shopping cart or high chair while still holding my baby. I also find it difficult to fold it back up after removing the child. Juggling the child/infant in one hand and gathering it from the shopping cart or high chair with the other, and getting keys ready seems a bit challenging but I have gotten better with time. I now wait until I get back to the car to fold it back up, or just leave it unpacked until the next use. I am glad I bought it, helping to protect against germs is reason enough to purchase it."
5,THIS IS WONDERFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have a one year old and the Floppy seat goes everywhere with us . To the grocery store , out to resturants and even to Home Depot with my husband . Our daughter loves the softness of the Floppy seat and loves to relax while we shop. I would highly recommed the Floppy seat to anyone who is thinking about buying it . Also just think those grocery carts and high chairs in resturants are filled with germs . Kara , Syracuse, NY"
5,Peace of mind!,"Great peace of mind, for me, against germs.Easy to use while grocery shopping andgreat for those not-so-clean high chairs atrestaurants. The pocket is great to hold baby's milkand there are attachment links where you can addbaby's toys. We don't leave home without it."
2,cheap,it looks pretty cool it was cheap enough. It came cracked at the base whewre the cord comes out but i never return anything unless its expensiv(pain ...]) i just trash em in the survey. it does look pretty cool in my retro office thogh but its very light(cheap ) so dont expect much.
2,Proofreading needed,"Careful editing is necessary for all books. Careful editing is a must for grammar books. When students find errors in a book that is supposed to provide clear instructions for them, the book misses the mark. Check page 175, the American English example: "". . . based on their skin color rather than for THEY way THEY are driving."""
2,Somewhat disappointing,"Coming to this book after the previous four novels of the ""Children of Violence"" (Martha Quest) series, I was quite surprised and disappointed. Whereas the previous books were delightful in their subtlety, this one seemed more of a polemic...more like sledgehammer work. Lessing seems to have regained her form later in Briefing For Descent Into Hell and the science fiction, but I couldn't really recommend this one. I'm very surprised that it seems to be one of her most popular books."
2,Review of the Kindle Version -POORLY DONE,"I read this book, made into a Kindle version by Harper Collins. There were so many mistakes! I was able to get through the story, but there were so many errors it gives this publisher a horrible reputation. Multiple times an ""I"" was rendered as a numeral 1. So many problems like this plagued the book I am not sure I got the whole story.THAT aside, this book is a magnificent story. I used kindle to underline dozens of passages and may very well begin to read it again right away."
5,magnificent,"As a violinist, i stumbled across this cd by accident. But i am sure glad i did! I had no idea that there was so much fantastic repertoire for the saxophone and that there was such a magnificent performer of the instrument in Mr. Kerkezos. I paticulary enjoyed the villa lobos, the 3rd movement is taken at such a speed! In this he manages to make it sound so effortless and musical while playing obviously very technally difficult passages."
5,Excellent NSBM for people who don't care about NSBM,"This is easily one of my favorite black metal releases of the past five years (has it been that long?). If you're put off by the National Socialist messages they espouse, that's your business -- go listen to Emperor or Dimmu Borgir. Just don't let your personal views interfere with your views of this album, and don't consider taking anything away from Nokturnal Mortum. They've put together an insanely brutal black metal album this time around. Even after the release of ""Weltanschauung"", and countless other amazing black metal albums from other bands over the past few years, this CD still finds its way to my playlist quite often."
5,Seems to help my son's tummy pains,My developmental son says it makes him feel better. I originally found this product recommended on a site for parents of autistic children.
2,Yuck!,"Good product, bad taste. How do you get a child with oral sensitivities that needs supplementation to ""take"" these? A chewable gummy form would be much more acceptable."
2,Interesting but very biased,"I found the information provided in this book to be very thought provoking. The historical side of Christianity is one you rarely hear mentioned within the modern church. But in reading this book the author is found to entertain many ideas involved in ""modern criticism"" that are much more philosophically related rather than truly historically related. Some of the author's statements are purely contradictory to all accepted Christian doctrine, thus throwing doubt onto other claims made by the author. At the same time the author never allows himself to entertain any commonly believed Christian views, further displaying his bias. I would not recommend this book because of the repeated failures to equally evaluate all potential views."
4,Smooth as silk,"These are the songs of the 50's and 60's as The Nylons re-imagine them. Culled from their albums up to ""Rockapella,"" this is what they do best. It also includes their lone ""hit,"" an energetic cover of Steam's ""Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye."" The lack of any substantial follow-up chart singles is certainly no fault of The Nylons, as this collection proves. Their versions of ""Happy Together,"" ""This Boy"" and ""Poison Ivy"" could have easily transcended novelty status to make a splash on the radio.It doesn't mean you should allow this secret pleasure to avoid your CD collection. If a primo blend of voices with a very spare instrumentation (usually little more than drum machines) tickles your fancy, then the collection is truly a ""Perfect Fit."""
2,"Do Not Be Fooled, This Album Contains Remixes","I bought this album because I looked at the track list and saw that it had all the hits I knew and loved. Sadly, once I listened to it, I was very disappointed to hear some of my favorite songs (The Lion Sleeps Tonight, Happy Together, and Poison Ivy to name a few) remixed with an awful 80's drum machine. If you want the real goods, purchase the original 1982 self titled Nylons album,I wish I had. I would have given it 1 star, but it still contains the original versions of some songs including Love Potion #9 and Duke of Earl."
4,No es Malo,"As the lead singer of The Mavericks, Malo is responsible for some of the most exciting and passionate recorded performances of the last 10 years. This departure from that group (whether temporary or permanent, we know not) allows Raul to dive head-on into the stream of Latin sounds and rhythms of his heritage. Whether singing en engles o espanol, he conveys both the beauty and the fire with his clarion tenor. Accompanied by as hot a band as imaginable, he has awarded us with music that simply drives us to dance, in spite of our ` pieds izquierdas' (left feet)."
2,Too Latin for my tastes,"I agree with the reviewer that called this a ""daring"" compilation. Mainstream fans of Mr. Malo's, like myself, who enjoy the Mavericks, may not appreciate this CD. Although I like the Mavericks music, which is sprinkled with Latin influences, the ""Today"" CD is just too much for me. I would urge people to download the samples before buying, as I wish I had."
1,big disappointment,"Just listened to this cd. I had anxiously waited ever since the Mavericks broke up. What a letdown.I could find nothingof the Raul Malo that I loved in the Mavericks ""crying Shame"",Trampoline and other hits. Where is that rich voice? Hope the next cd will concentrate on this wonderful voice and get rid of some of the twang. Lets get back to country. I'll be waiting.lena"
5,Great band,Raul Malo was recommended by WXPN. I had heard some of his work with the Mavericks and loved his version of Downbound Train on the Nebraska cover album. This is very listenable world music.
4,"Fusion of Cuban Beats, 60s Anglo Pop, and That Voice","It would be a mistake to call this Raul Malo's Latin Album, because it's not just about that. The frontman for the Mavericks turns out a solo effort that mixes American pop of both the 60s and standards eras with Cuban music, and the result is an album as varied as Malo's impressive vocal capabilities. The title track jolts you with blaring horns and an infectious, raucous beat. ""Ya Tu Veras"" is both lively and relaxed, ""De Ti Me Olvidare"" brings it down with slow soulfulness, and Latin rhythm underpins other tracks like ""Every Little Thing About You."" On the other hand, Malo can sing standard/lounge tradition buttery smooth, as in the wonderful duet ""Takes Two to Tango"" with Shelby Lynne, and ""Are We Almost There"" ranks up there with his best Mavericks ballad moments. If you love marvelous voices or music with a Latin beat, go get this one."
1,Raul Malo's New Songs Aren't Good,"I think Raul Malo has an absolutely terrific voice. However, this album doesn't do him justice, and as much as I like his voice and previous works with the Mavericks, I wouldn't buy this album. He needs a better song writer and musical arranger."
4,good single,get right was a pretty good single from jennifer lopez. and is as good as her other singles from the past.
3,A Rewind? Re-released remixes? A little better plz?!,"Okay, the reason for 3 stars is that most of the remixes here are already released on previous singles. Quite old actually by now. I am sorry but if you have other singles from from her album ""J.Lo"", just get the two track single of this. This single includes remixes from ""If You Had Me"" and ""Love Don't Cost A Thing"". I wish they would release some new remixes to go with this fantastic song! DONT"" GET ME WRONG! I Love ""Get Right""!!!! But some new stuff would be nice at least a few ""NEW"" remixes. But it's okay if you don't have her older singles. This could go as a complimentary choice. It's up to you. But don't take my word just listen to it yourself first!"
3,Catchy Cut&the Same ole Same old,another example of J-LO having a halfway decent cut but due to Her Limited Vocal Range a Song Suffers in the big picture due to the fact.I dig the Sax&The Groove on this Cut. Her Voice is burried low in the Mix to cover the obvious.but the Song is catchy.
4,sooner or later,it took longer than i thought to get the product but everything else was fine-thank you-
2,Don't Get Right,"It definitely can be so outrageous for manufactured acts to really try to chart up again. For Jennifer Lopez, that isn't a good sign. After her lackluster This Is Me.. Then, she hasn't found any way of touring, and performing on stage to prove you are a credible singer again. Her lastest single, Get Right, from her upcoming album Rebirth, really doesn't have a lot of beat in it. The beat outshines Jennifer's voice, which is very rare, but still not very well put. Sadly, this isn't a very good song, and for somebody like Jennifer Lopez, it is time to start touring for your music, and prove you can sing your heart out.Song: D"
3,Ew,"This song is definitely not her best. The horns are annoying the lyrics are third-grade. J.Lo is a good singer/songwriter/dancer butr she needs to lose those horns. This song is a rip-off of Beyonce's fantastic ""Crazy in Love""."
4,Bigger is better,It is a little oversized but does the job when I am out playing around with my camera.
4,long lasting battery,"This is good replacement battery whcih last long ( 3x) than one shipped with my camcorderOnly concern is size is bigger and looks slightly awkward when attached, though it doesn't impact any operations.JVC : develop same powerful battery in smaller size :)"
1,Not good,"It looks authentic, the appearance and the size etc, but actually, it does not last as long as the Ad said. I used it only ten minutes it showed the two scales (total 4) have been consumed. Not very happy about it."
5,JVC Extended Battery,"Wow am I glad I bought this battery. A friend who has a similar camera said I wouldn't need this but I found that it adds more stability to the camera as a thumb rest when shooting, an added bonus to the extended battery run time you get from this battery over the original that comes with the camera. I can shoot for hours with this baby before having to recharge it. Pair this with the optional battery charger and you are set for long days of shooting. I hardly ever use the original battery anymore.JVC BN-VF823U 2190-mAh Rechargeable Data Battery for JVC MiniDV and Everio Camcorders"
2,Duchovny: Yes. This book: NO.,"I love David Duchovny, don't get me wrong. However, I could barely make it through his biography. It's written in a very disjointed fashion, and everything mentioned is so out-of-order. It's also VERY outdated; so it's not even really worth getting now. The picture section, I will admit, is awesome; some of the best photos of David yet. The X-Files episode guide is extremely outdated; it only goes to season 3. 5 years ago, this book would have been a joy for me to read. But being madly in love with David Duchovny, I already know most of what was in there. If you want anything recent on David, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. The mediocre writing quality and ancient episode guide really isn't worth it."
4,Very good,"Series Three of Monarch of the Glen is one of the show's strongest seasons. All of the actors settle into their characters and come off as real people even when the writers saddle them with very cartoonish behaviors.The introduction of Stella Moon (yes, that is the character's name) brings just the right amount of antagonism to the show. And the character herself, played by the wonderful Alexandra Gilbreath, displays both strength and vulnerability and thus comes off as a more fully developed person than is often seen in such a role.Any fan of the show should add this season to their collection."
4,Good Highland Dram,"I enjoyed this good highland drama so far.The plots have been intreasting, and there is always romance.So far so good!"
3,"Not getting better, but still the Glen","I can't say that the series improved in year three, but it was still entertaining. I'm angry that Katrina's leaving was taken so flippantly. I find that the story lines seemed redundant, too. I like the character Archie, but I think they spend so much time making him seem an idiot, or at least very naive, that he lacks depth. Well, if you're caught, you're caught. I will continue watching."
4,One of the most disturbing books I have ever read.,"This is a sequel to ""Marching Through Georgia"" It is very well done, and the disturbing part is that but for the grace of god it could have happened. Very good alternate history, and highly thought provoking, but not much fun. When you realize that the good guys loose (Aparently forever) you understand that this is a very unusual book. Highly recomended"
5,"Haunting,frightening...this is a real ""can't go to sleeper!""","If you like the topic of alternate history in science fiction,you will find no more plausibly constructed nor better character-developed novel anywhere! That it is totally disquieting is only a tribute to the author's ability to craft a world that doesn't adhere to our notions of the way things should be but that is completely believable"
4,The King Bumi Action Figure is Awesome!,"I love the series The Avatar and King Bumi is no doubt one of my favorite characters of the series. I am absolutely thrilled with the action figure so much so that I haven't taken him out of the box yet! I never do that, it's terrible I know I should take him out and display him proudly but he just looks so nice in his box. :)The only things I'm disappointed about are some of the color variations from the online pictures and the images on the packaging, but that's to be expected. Also I had hoped for a little more with the accessories. But over all it's a good toy and pretty accurate to the characters details.I'd recommend this toy to anyone who is a fan of the show, adults and kids alike! Hope you enjoy it and try to look for a decent price since this toy tends to be on the rare side around the web. I snatched this for $10 plus $5 sh here on Amazon from a private seller."
2,US material contains mistakes,"This maybe a good book on UK bunkers of which there are many listed and detailed. US information contains many errors in the first edition. Example: Mount Pony Currency Vault for ""North"" of the Mississippi, should be ""East"" (the Mississippi flows North to South). The book is also full of the author anti-commentary, rather than descriptive analysis of the preparations. Does however have a map of Raven Rock which is rare to find."
4,a good book,"this is a very good book and read , i recommend it as it is chock full of information , but it mostly only covers the buildings of cold war england , which it didnt mention in the editorial review , though there is a bit about norrad and sage and some early american cold war projects in the biginning.i did expect some more indepth pictures of some of the sites which is why i only gave it a 4 (with more pictures i would have given it a 5) overall it is a recommended read and an excelent addition to a post ww2 library."
2,You will be dummy if you buy this book,"Poorly written, jumps back and force between the topics not yet explained"
3,Very good introduction to SQL for beginners.,"The book is well organized and simple for beginners to understand. It starts off with the simple stuff and works up to more complicated issues such as unions etc. If your a beginner, I recommend this book highly. If you have access to a SQL database at home, the examples are easy to follow, although depending on your database you may need to tweak the language a little."
1,Get to the point,Someone who is interested in getting the facts for rapid database development will find this book frustrating. Uses way to much filler.
1,SQL for DUmmies,"i will be happy to review this, if and WHEN i finally recieve it. i have submitted a complaint already."
2,Don't waste your money,I was unimpressed with the way this book is presented. Not enough examples of core SQL.
4,Good intro to SQL,"This book helps to ""demystify"" SQL. Before I started reading this and also ""Learn SQL in 10 Minutes,"" by Ben Forta, I had a mortal fear of databases, one that thanks to this book I now realize is totally unfounded. This book has a lot of good technical information about SQL, but it's presented in a way that makes it easy to understand and won't ""scare off"" the beginners like me. I liked how the author took great pains to explain a lot of SQL commands, making them relate to the topic being discussed.The first two chapters cover relational database and SQL fundamentals. The next few chapters discuss more details about SQL, first its ""languages,"" then how to build a SQL database, and once it's built how to retrieve data from it, and also issues relating to keeping it secure.Generally, a good ""Dummies"" book on a complex subject."
1,rambling and disorganized,"This book is a waste of money. Disorganized, rambles, presents examples without explaining them fully, repeats sections, hard to find what you are looking for since it is written in such a hodgepodge style, not good for either learning for the 1st time or as a reference."
2,Where's the Beef?!,"If you want to do any serious SQL db work, don't get this book. If you only want a general, superficial explanation and minimal understanding of SQL, and don't really need to do any serious work (such as your manager) then this book is for you."
2,Funring...Funny but Boring,"The book presents a fun layout, catchy illustrations, balloons, and all, however, it`s written in a boring way. I was looking for a fast track learning in SQL and unfortunately got stuck in this traffic jam..."
4,prompt deliv..great price.,"prompt delivery. A bit old version but great for price, would purchase again. I am not a techie I just bought for overall concepts"
2,Too academic and complex,"This book is too academic in the sense that it is a collection of theory with little practical examples and that goes too far into complex technical detail. It seems like the man pages have just been copied and formatted, with a little extra explanation (but not much.)"
4,Good Quick Resource,"This book is a good, quick and easy to refer to reference book. I save a lot of time and it is interesting reading"
4,Great for Penny Arcade fans; needs more comments,"I love Penny Arcade and think they are one of the more consistently funny webcomics out there. This book consists of their early work, and to be honest is not as funny as their more recent stuff. I think it's great for fans who want to see how Penny Arcade started, and get some comments from the creators. I also think longer comments would've been great, as I love Jerry Holkins's humor (but why didn't Mike Krahulik say anything?). All in all, I liked it well enough for the sake of learning PA's backstory, but on the early comics are not that impressive on their own."
5,Good Book,I have been following Penny Arcade for over 7 years and have always enjoyed their contribution to video games and the internet. I really liked the book and can't wait for volume 2.
3,first year,"penny arcades comic strips are usually topical, and considering all these strips come from the first year or two of PA, a lot of them are dated (which even tycho acknowledges in the bonus commentary). The art style is also a bit of a letdown when compared to the current style. This doesn't mean that the art is bad, it just shows how greatly the art has evolved over the years. As it stands, if you're a fan of Penny Arcade, this is a must buy. For the average fan and non-fan, though, it might be best to simply check out the strip archives on the website."
2,CLOCK DOES NOT WORK!,"Let me reiterate what others have mentioned as the major flaw to this product - the LCD display for the clock does not work! I bought one of these and the clock stopped working within just a few days. I exchanged it for another one and the clock would not display after only a few hours. This is obviously not a fluke - but a major, recurring problem with the product. Also as others have noted, if you want a decent-sounding docking station that will charge your Ipod and if you can find it on super-sale, this is okay. Definitely not worth more than $25, compared to other, similar products. The positive features are that it's small and easy to move around and really does sound okay for its size. If you buy it, ignore the fact that it's advertised to be an alarm clock (or that it has a clock at all) - because this is not the functionality you'll receive."
2,Broken,"Item's display only worked for the first five minutes or so, now just a blank screen so you cannot see the clock, set the alarm, or see the input/volume control....."
1,Save your money,"It did arrive on time. I bought it for my daughter mainly to be used as an alarm clock. But the fact it played the ipod, was a plus. The thing about this, is it needs to remote to set the clock, the remote worked for a few weeks, and wouldn't work anymore. So the alarm is useless. So more me this was a total waste of money."
3,Memo does not equal text,"I was disappointed when I received the organizer and realized I could not store notes or memos with text, only numbers, spaces and the dash. I wanted to store to-do lists etc. I guess only phone numbers need organization."
4,good enough for what I want.,"I got it for about $15. It works great for what I need most.I like the secrte function to store my password.Pros: good price, small and light, battery last over a year without hassle of recharge, secret password.Cons: no to-do-list, no calender.The 2nd and 3rd line in Memo only allow numbers. I got around it by storing most information in the first line."
3,CD BREAKUPS,I wanted to be moved.. to feel something.. this CD did not move me...lolIt was ok and I am probably just a generation too old to appreciate it.
2,Good until the end,"While I've always found the theme of the ""Kingdom"" less personal that the King, this book does a good job of tracing that line of thinking through Scripture. My problem came with the author's end time view. It appears as if the author does not believe in a literal Millennium. He states on page 145 that it is, ""not meant to be understood literally."" If you hold to a literal view of the Millennium be aware that the author's view is different."
2,Simple Broad Strokes,"The author admittedly takes a simple, broad attempt at synchronizing the whole Bible. Though some disagree with his approach, one cannot argue with his honesty and humility. This book is great for beginning Bible student and deserves the recommendation of teachers and disciplers."
4,Great overview of the whole bible,"This book provided a wonderful overview of the entire bible in one book. Not an indepth study, but it was fun to read about the bible, all 66 books in one volume. It also helped in understanding how they all fit together and that the central theme is God's redemptive plan for mankind."
5,God's Big Picture is a great overview of the Historic progression of the Bible,Length:: 1:21 MinsHaving not been schooled in the Bible I was a bit intimidated by the thought of reading a book about it. But I found this the perfect introduction for continued study of the Bible. This is a terrific overview for beginners.God's Big Picture: Tracing the Storyline of the Bible
4,Handbook for a healthy house (and a healthy you!),"If you've ""tried everything"" to keep from getting sick all the time, read this book. Chances are, you'll find that you did not try everything. The author gives various details of how the house we live in and what makes it ""tick"" can ultimately make us ill. With over 20 years of experience and research into this subject, Margaret has tracked down the many causes of her family's illnesses, many of which were caused by the very home they live in. This book will make you think twice about your home and what we normally take for granted in our home, such as the electricity, hot water heater, etc. A very interesting read."
1,A handbook for future hypochondriacs,"The ""disclaimer"" at the beginning makes clear that the author is a ""good christian"" and if you don't want to read a christian book, then don't buy this one. That was the first red flag. These books should come with warning labels. Then I skimmed through the various subjects and was reading about water softeners and what affect they might have on health. The author claimed, when the softener was on that it caused her entire family to crave butter. Not margarine, but butter. She didn't clarify salted or unsalted. I had hoped to find an answer to my craving for chicken pudding, but was not able to do so. If you purchase this book be prepared to remove all of your electrical system, plumbing system, carpets, furniture, walls, roof and the foundation to your home - all of it and the food you eat is making you sick."
2,Not for me.,"I was hopeful about this book having a plethora of info, but for me somethings were too obvious, and others were way over my head.I didn't even finish reading this one, sometimes I got a little put off by the authors reaching for a connection between her house and every symptom she and her family experiences. Seemed like every minor body symptom, she'd attribute to a change in her environment. I simply cannot be that OCD about it...Some may like this book, some will hate it. If you are completely ignorant about your environment and diet having an affect on your health, it might make you more mindful about the topic."
4,Could call it Memories of a Glorious Past at this point..,"OK short stories for what they are, more so if you were unfamiliar with the cast of business personalities from primarily the 1990s. Was funny them mocking Marvel by using ostracized kids who thought they could ""identify"" with the characters in the comics.Arrived by Amazon with some roughed edges (despite ordering it with a calculator!), so my copy definitely won't be a collector's item even if, as the Perelman-Marvel story probably would make obvious, probably was wishful thinking anyway :)"
1,Illegible on a Kindle 3,"This book is completely illegible on my Kindle 3. The speech bubbles contain text written in a black font on a dark gray background. It is impossible to zoom in and read anything because it is formatted as a .mobi. It also contains numerous ""blank"" pages that are frustrating.I have no idea if the book is good or not as I can't read it!"
3,"For true laughs, opt for ""X-Presidents""","I enjoyed ""X-Presidents"" so much I thought I'd try ""Titans of Finance,"" thinking it would be in the same vein. While inspired, ""Titans"" is just not in the same league. If you're in finance and enjoy seeing some fine skewerings (most of them deserved), then give this book a whirl. Otherwise, spend a few more dollars and go for the ""X-Presidents."""
4,"At last, a critic who enjoys movies!","This book is comprehensive, detailed, and humorous. Just the thing I was looking for in a video guide book. This book is one of the best, along with Videohound's Golden Movie Retriever 2000 and The Manly Movie Guide. For one of the best alternatives to the Internet Movie Database read Roger Ebert's Movie Yearbook 1999 (not to be confused with version 1998)."
4,Interesting New Format,"This new kind of venture is a fun read. I have several past volumes of his Video Companion and have always enjoyed Mr. Ebert's reviews. This tome has some great stuff in his more scathing reviews. The previous collections of critiques were getting a little top heavy with favorable reviews presumably to encourage people to check out some hidden gems. This book gives you a real idea of the films he slogs through on a weekly basis. As for people who are miffed because he has an honest change of opinion sometimes, the only people whose ideas never change are dead or employ expensive spin-doctors to convince you that they had that belief all along."
4,In depth and very comprehensive.,I felt the book had a lot of good points to it. I was amazed at how in depth it was!
4,"Huge Fan of Laurie Berkner, Son can't get enough!!","Hello,I just thought I would let all of you know a little more about this product. I bought the original and stumbled upon this one on the site and had to contact Amazon to find out what it was, just received it. It is a bit beat up but I will be contacting them. This is the complete plus system with the Laurie Berkner catridge, we are huge fans! This is not sold in stores, you can only purchase on Amazon. The songs included are Boots, Bottle Caps, I'm Gonna Catch you, Fruit Salad Salsa and Drive my car. I haven't given it to my son yet, as it is a Christmas present, but tested it out and he is sure to love!"
5,Great toy for kids ages 2-4,"My 21 month old daughter loves her new Learn Through Music Plus! She has just discovered the microphone and is having a blast singing into it and hearing herself. Right now she enjoys the songs the most, but I'm sure in a couple of months she will understand the ""games"" more. We purchased a few more cassettes and she really likes the Elmo Scavenger Hunt. I really like the Laurie Berkner cassette, although the songs are a bit short so hearing them over and over can get a little annoying. There is a volume control, but even the soft volume is a bit loud. Otherwise, it's a great toy. This toy was a big hit with my almost 4 year old nephew too! He played with it the whole time he was at my house."
1,A piece of crap,"This is the biggest piece of crap that I have seen in a long time. The video is bad, the sound is worse. The mix sounds like it was recorded in a barrel. I honestly think the soundtrack was taken from the live cameras. The songs fade in and out, start in the middle of songs and cuts some songs in half. Furthermore Buffalo Springfield is Buffalo Springfield Revisited. Awful."
4,"Great mount, but",Well I would say theses mounts are greatpro's:Look goodseem to be very strongdo exactly what I neededCon's:The screws includes for mounting broke as i was screwing into the wallthe wall anchors don't really hold the sheet rock all that well and just ripped out ended up using my own mounting hardware.I would Suggest these to anyone with a suggestion of buy your own mounting hardware prior to hanging cause i had to do some patch work to my walls.
5,great value,Great value for your money. This product was easy to assemble and put up.I would recomend this product to everyone.
3,Does what it says,"Fit the monitors perfect. My only issue is there is no left to right adjustment. If you don't mount it perfectly level, you are stuck with a crooked monitor. The mounting holes are a bit small so I had to open them up to fit a standard toggle bolt thru. Otherwise you can't beat the price."
4,VideoSecu wallmount,This was very easy to install and the quality is excellent. Only drawback is that it only swings to the left and right; wish it could tilt up and down.
1,"Good bracket, poor instructions and hardware","The bracket is solid, although I don't think I would trust it with more than 15 to 20 lbs.As for mounting, the instructions are useless as they are in ""engrish"". Thankfully as I install cctv as my profession, so that wasn't an issue.What was a major problem was the poor quality hardware included. The instructions say not to use the included dry wall anchors. (Why include them then?)Worst of all, the slightly undersized stud mounting screws stripped out the second I tried to tighten them into the pre-drilled holes. Trying to loosen them stripped out in both directions.Nothing worse than being on a jobsite and having to go to the hardware store to go buy two screws!"
2,Slightly misleading,"Im not a techy in the least bit so when i read the title stating it was a TV Wall mount thats what i thought it was. but it is not, it is for a much smaller screen like a computer monitor so just keep that in mind."
3,Did the job,"overall was good, stuck out from wall more than I expected but the attributes of the ability to turn up, down, or side to side was worth the extra bulk."
3,"The right mount for me, may not be right for you.","Considering all factors this is a great mount for a specific need. It looks nice, it is constructed durably, and supports my 23"" Viewsonic monitor. The reason it is a $15.00 mount is clear. If you want to be able to frequently adjust the tilt angle and move the monitor in and out, this is NOT the one for you. The pivot points loosen with every movement, necessitating a tightening of the pivot screws. Also, this mount does not allow height adjustments, and the mounting hardware is 100% garbage and should be thrown out immediately."
4,Mounting Bracket,"Great product to mount a 19 inch Flat Screen TV. You may need screws if you are hanging directly into the stud (as they are not provided). Also, tighten the mount in all appropriate places prior to attaching the TV. For the price, this item can't be beat."
5,Nice mount for the money,"This is the best mount for the money. Installation was easy and a breeze, my 11 year old installed it in his room. We mounted a 24 inch tv on the wall, you won't find a mount that is constructed and works like this one for the money."
3,Does what it's suppose to,"When I installed 3 of these I was expecting to have at least a little bit of breathing room, but when you install these it is very unforgiving. If you miss your mark by a fraction of an inch then you'll have a hole in your wall and almost unable to put another screw where you want it. I don't know, maybe I was just unlucky and most people don't have a problem with it, but that's my 2cents."
2,"Decent once up, but never installed something more frustrating!","Screws stripped, had to buy new ones. I have done remodeling and this thing was still super hard to put up. Once it was up, the monitor actually fell down, completely bending the stripped screws they had sent, I finally got it up again, and though I measured it strait, my monitor is crooked. It now has been up a month and seems to be working fine, but I really wish I had spent the extra 20 dollars and gotten something more easily mountable. This one was just not worth the headache.In case anyone is wondering, my monitor was a 23 inch monitor that weighed less than 10 lbs (7 or 8 I believe)."
2,You get what you pay for...in this case,Bracket arrived on time and tracking was good. As others have stated....measured and leveled only to look at a monitor that leans to the left. Aluminum screws strip very very very easily. I am a contractor and am very capable of installing with out damage to screws...next to impossible in this case. I didn't pay much for this bracket and I didn't get much in return. Unless you want to walk around with your head tilted to the left from using this bracket...spend some more money and get something with tighter tolerances.
2,Tilt will not stay up.,"I purchased this product about a year ago for my 19"" Samsung LCD monitor. It was easy enough to install with the correct anchors. Unfortunately, the tilt is sloppy. I have to constantly adjust and tighten to keep the monitor from pointing to the floor. It's a pain in the butt. Spend the extra money and buy a better quality mount."
2,Does not work with Toshiba 15LV 505 that Amazon recommends to use with.,The Toshiba 15LV 505 [ASIN:B001DZJVO2 Toshiba 15LV505 15.6-Inch Widescreen LCD TV with Built-in DVD Player (Black)] that I bought from Amazon (which is great) does not have VESA connection for this wall mount (VideoSecu MLB)yet Amazon recommended it to use with this TV set. Apparently the 15LV 505 is really not wall mountable. I wanted it on my kitchen wall about 7 inches off the counter top to free up space but now I can't.
4,Pretty good,"The only reason I didn't give a 5 star rating is because the arm has a slight play in it, but other than that it fit very good my 23"" tv I bought it for."
2,have your own hardware,Hardware made out of cheap metal. Ive seen better metal used for bottle caps. Mount works just fine . Screws strip out .
4,Sturdy but likes to loosen,Just as description says its sturdy but loosens with use a bit more than I would like. I am sure it's nothing a bit of locktite wouldn't cure.
5,For small flat screens,"This mount was a good match for the 22 in. Visio flat screen TV that my wife wanted in our master bath room. It was easy to install and it is very adjustable. My wife is happy with how it works, so I am happy."
5,Cheap but well built!,"Pretty simple, completely adjustable and installed it without a hitch. Seems very well put together as well and you can adjust tension on every joint. I love it!"
5,Well made,I would recommend this product to my friends. The product was made stronger than i had anticipated.The bracket was easy to install.
5,No complaints,"This wall mount was way cheaper than any I saw in the retail stores. On top of that, it was really easy to install and worked perfectly with the 19"" LCD I bought. The only hardware I had to buy were longer nuts, bolts and washers since I installed it on the side of a free-standing wood closet intead of the wall. It worked perfectly."
5,Good Quality,I found the item to be of very high quality. The metal is strong and sturdy. The monitor also tilts up and down so you can mount as high or low as you want on the wall.
3,Get what you pay for,"I purchased four of these for our home office. We have 2 24"" HP monitors, and 2 23.6"" Acers. Everything went up fairly easy, the installation was seamless. But the mounts are not very sturdy, if you swivel a monitor too far in 1 direction, it leans in that direction due to the monitor's weight. We didn't have a lot of room, so our 4 monitors are spaced on 5 studs @ 16"" each. All 4 monitors lean and it's impossible to tighten the mount enough in any way to stop that from happening. It bothers me to no end, and I will eventually replace them because my monitors dont properly line up.For some people, this isn't an issue. If you're picky and just need them to sit in one place, perfectly aligned... Spend a bit more."
2,Wall Mount is Junk,"The mount appears to be well made and is easy to install, but if you extend the arm at all the TV will hang at a noticeable angle. You can tighten the arm nuts but it won't fix the problem. This item is going back as it looks terrible."
5,Perfect in every way,"This product shipped on time, arrived on time and is exactly what I was hoping for. Easy to assemble and flexible. Works great!"
3,Wall mount,The product appears to be very sturdy and well manufactured. The only negative thing I would say is it should come with a lag bolt screw instead of a phillips head screw. I drilled a pilot hole and screw still stripped out. With a lag screw this would be eliminated.
3,decent for the price - crappy screws,The mount is satisfactory but the screws that it provides to mount to the stud are very soft heads and strip out very easily. Be sure to drill pilot holes first that are long enough.
4,nice product,"This product was very easy to install and works great for a 22"" TV. No problems at all."
4,Sleek look,"I like the sleek look, however its not easy for an average female to install. I am still waiting on my handy-guy to install it for me."
5,great for small TVs,"I was impressed by the solid quality of this unit. I was 1/2 expecting something pretty cheaply built, but that doesn't seem to be the case. It's great.We have it connected to a little 22"" tv, so:A.) the tv's super light so I'm sure I won't have any weight issues(though I'd expect it to hold the limit it advertises, if installed into a stud and all).B.) we require it to swivel sideways 90 degrees 1/2 the time. It accomplishes that fine with out tv, but I'd expect a larger tv wouldn't make that complete angle turn without hitting the wall, based on the maximum length of this unit's arms. So keep that in mind.That said, it's great, perfect, for us!"
4,TV Wall Mount Bracket,Received product quicker than expected. Everything worked well except the mounting screws. The metal is very soft and would strip when screwing them into the wall. Had to go out and buy new and better made screws.
4,Inexpensive and strong.. Instructions could have been better,"Sturdy and low profile so my 22 inch TV tucks in nicely to the wall. The only gripe I have is that there were little to no instructions with it. I know it's pretty self explanatory but it would have been nice to know what size holes to drill in the wall to place the screws into. I've never mounted anything large onto the wall and this isn't even that big but it requires some serious holes in the wall. (>1/4 inch, close to 3/8)."
1,lousy screws,"I was excited when I received this as the quality looked great. Although, on installation, I've learned otherwise. After drilling pilot holes into the stud, I attempted to screw the mount onto the wall. It's as if these screws were made out of pewter. The heads stripped nearly instantly, half way into the wall, and stripped more when I tried to back them off. Using a dremel to make a slot in the head for a standard screwdriver, and the heads practically disintegrated. What should have been a five minute job has now become a mess. I'm now looking a the mount, half hanging on the wall."
3,Does not fold flat,TV sticks out from wall a little bit on this mount. I wish it folded up flatter. It feels pretty secure
5,Great holder for the money.,This unit was very easy to instal and works with any TV. It is very solid and the build quality is excellent for the money. Wise purchase.
2,Cheaply made and mounting screws are junk,"Prior to mounting this model, I mounted another TV with Sanus full motion flat panel mount. The Sanus was a breeze to mount TV with and very sturdy. This unit, made by VideoSecu was a different story. Instead of using large lag bolts (like the Sanus)to mount bracket with, VideoSecu decides to use cheaply made phillips head screws. I drilled pilot holes, but even with that both screws cammed out before tightening completely. So, I had to get them back out with pliers and mount bracket with a couple of zinc coated construction screws. In the meantime, the wall paint ended up getting scratched and thing is one piece, so TV has to be balanced while all this is going on. I was totally aggravated by the time I got through with this project...This mount seems flimsy compared to the Sanus, I just hope TV stays on the wall.Pay a little more and get a much better mount, such as the Sanus SF213-B1 from J&R;."
3,Sturdy mount but misaligned,"The bracket seems sturdy, but the assembly is misaligned. Basically the plate attaching to the monitor is misaligned causing the monitor to hang down to one side by more than a quarter inch. Fixable by mounting the wall plate at a slight angle and widening the mounting holes by a bit to make them level, but this is rather annoying. Even though the arm is inexpensive it should be fitting correctly.So if you don't mind doing some metal work on the frame it's fine (it will probably only take me a few minutes to fix and then it's a good arm for the money). If you look for something that makes your monitor hang level when installed properly without messing with the arm choose something else."
5,VideoSecu,"The VideoSecu is a simple strait to the point and easy to install wall mount . I purchased three of these mounts to mount three HP 2711 X 27"" pc monitors . Needless to say I had to remove the back covers on the monitors and reinforce them,and install threded inserts to complete the mounting job. I would buy this product again and do recomend it .Regards"
5,Best Deal Ever!,"I had previously priced similar wall mount brackets for the new 19"" TV my husband gave me for Christmas.I found them form $80-$90 locally. I was a little hesitant to buy this one, but the reviews were good.I am so pleased! My husband had no trouble mounting it. It swivels and tilts great and is super heavy duty!I would highly recommend this mount as long as you check your VESA listing in your TV instruction booklet toensure it will fit. We did, and it is just wonderful! Even my very particular hubby is super happy with it."
4,Does the job!,"Using this for a twenty inch monitor for a while now. All metal - good quality affordably priced product. Tension on the joints (set by the allen wrench provided)cannot be maintained if you have to reposition the monitor every now and then. But it's no big deal for as long as you mount it level on the wall so that it doesn't drift to one side. Also, screws could be stronger, so don't torque your driver too much when you install this product into a stud. Recommended!"
4,Excellent TV / Monitor Wall Mount Bracket,"Bought this for my travel trailer. Product was received in great shape with attaching hardware and instructions. Mounting was intuative and simple. Holds my 9-pound, 22-inch LED TV perfectly. Excellent quality for the price."
4,A Few Thoughts,"Most people have touched on the overall quality of this item. I think it's working very well on my wall with a 22"" LCD.My only complaints are that the wall mounting screws that come with it should not be used in a stud. Mine stripped immediately despite pre-drilled holes.Also, I leveled this thing to the letter, but the give in the mount after adding the TV weight causes a bit of uneveness. Overall, a nice product, and a great price.Think ahead and buy this now. If you go to any retail store, you are looking at at least half a c-note for this type of mount."
5,Good Value,Solid construction and easy to install. Furnished hardware fit my TV. Better than units costing three to four times as much in the usual retail stores.
4,Worked well with small TV,"Used this wall mount to install 26"" LED TV. Directions easy to follow. You do need 2 people to install, as the unit is one piece, so once it's attached to the wall (obviously, the bracket must be screwed into a stud), you have to have someone hold the TV up to the faceplate while the second person screws the TV onto the faceplate. Not too difficult, just need a little patience. Product did what I wanted it to do."
4,Great product !! BUT!!!,"The Product it self is great! does it job very well!! very sturdy, but you must buy your own screws , the screws for the the wall are very cheap and the head will get stripped with ease!! Save your self a head ache and buy new screws before starting installation!! other then that I love this product and for $16 cant complain!!"
4,"Just fine, especially for the price","This was pretty easy to install and holds our 37 inch flat screen TV without issue. I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because though you can move it out and side to side, you can't easily tilt it up and down. To do that you would have to loosen a bolt, adjust the TV and then tighten it again. If you plan to leave it oriented in one direction, this will never be an issue. This is a really excellent mount and really incredible for the money. I purchased it when it was more expensive, but the price keeps dropping. It's worth more than the price, for sure."
2,Not very impressed,"The monitor mount had a joint that is meant for tilting the screen forwards or backwards. This joint is very loose and wobbly, even though it's tightened all the way, and causes the screen to tilt left and right and be crooked.When the whole arm is extended, the screen rests tilted to one direction so its obviously not level, and when the arm is retracted the screen rests tilted to the other direction and also obviously not level. This also makes it so you can't adjust the screws holding it to the wall to fix the tilt either way."
5,Great Mounting Arm for Big or Small Displays,"SUMMARY: excellent mount, even big displaysPRO:- Versatile positioning. Arm can adjust distance from you, as well as left/right position, and also the angle of the screen.- Awesome price for the quality ($15 when I bought)- Strong: doesn't seem to strain one bit to hold my 27"" LCDCON:- Can't adjust height with arm (but this is not an advertised feature, so a moot point)- Tightening the screen angle takes a little trial and error to get it to where you want itOTHER:- Requires stud to mount the bracket to. If you try to mount into drywall this thing will prolly pull right out.Overall definitely recommend it."
5,Perfect for what I needed,"This bracket was perfect for the space and use I was looking for. I had ordered a different one first, but it did not fold up or extend the way this one does. Great item for mounting a small TV on the wall. Easy to install and set up in just a few minutes."
5,Very high quality for the price.,This mount compares to one that cost me $75 last year. I mounted a 22 inch VIZIO TV for my security cameras. It is strong and I highly recommend this item and seller. I also ordered cameras from this seller and I am very happy. Note: we did not use the included hardware to install this mount we mounted to an outside wall (concrete) and used Tapcons. I also recommend finding a stud and using high quality wood screws - I would never expect a drywall anchor to support a TV or monitor.
3,Not for a TV,"Just in case anyone else is confused...this is NOT to mount a flat screen TV. The box says Security Camera mount, and that's probably right. Or maybe a tiny security TV. It looks like a fine product, but claims it can hold 30lbs...our flat screen is only 24"" but not at all compatible to be mounted. Just FYI."
1,Terrible - do not buy,"Hand me down from daughter after she bought it on Amazon without noticing the small mounting plate for TV (there is an optional extension)...I bought a replacement for her at a local box store and took it home the VideoSecu for another TV I had.Mounts poorly (drywall anchors are a joke), arm is terribly stiff (like tens of pounds of pressure to move - which would rip out the drywall anchors), the mounting plate too small for many TVs, and black paint flakes off with little effort. I can not think of a positive aspect. Cheap Piece of ""Crap"" - there is a reason the price is listed as such.Don't say I didn't warn you!...good luck~!"
4,Great product,"For the price of this, I'm very happy. The metal is sturdy and it was very easy to put up. I paired it with a 22 inch Vizio flat screen and you can completely pull it out and turn it perpendicular to the wall where it is mounted, and the tilt helps (I have it up for watching on the elliptical, so it's high; but the tilt means I can also watch from my office desk.)It comes with an anchor for Sheetrock, but I would really recommend mounting it to the stud! If you don't have one, you might want to buy a better anchor at the hardware store. Also - we had to get new screws, as the other ones got stripped very easily."
2,good,it good it hold the TV in my office and that is about it in and out not tilt or up and down so make sure you have it right where you like it before butting it up not the best put it works
3,Won't hold up.,"Description says it is for TVs up to 25 lbs. Well, not even 20 lbs. Can't tighten the brakes enough to get it keep the screen up. Good thing I needed some down angle and have a wall there to brace the TV. Would be perfect for smaller (<15 lbs) VESA TVs."
2,Flimsy,This stand is flimsy and pretty small. I used it for a 25' LCD TV and I'm not convinced it would hold. Seems like it works fine for very small tvs.
4,TV wall mount,"Works great, a little tricky to align up and center the mounting holes but other wise it works good for the small tv."
3,Articulating TV Wall Mount,Great price does what it is expected to do. When fully extended it can be a little flimsy. Overall I give it a great review.
3,"Good for the price, but leveling is a challenge","The unit is sturdy and functions as advertised. However, to echo other reviews, I wish there was a right/left tilt adjustment to aid leveling the TV/monitor.There is some ""give"" in the mount when extended, so to get the screen close to level you'll need to attach the TV to the mount first. Then, with the arm extended, mark your wall attachment points. This makes installation a two person operation, and you may still need a couple of tries to get it right."
4,LCD monitor wall mount,"I used this item to mount my 22"" Acer LCD computer monitor to the wall above my computer desk. The intent was to create more workable space and be able to push the monitor out of the way when working at the desk. It mounted fine, though there was some shifting when the monitor was mounted and the screen was positioned all the way out. I didn't care because this is a computer monitor, but for someone using this as a TV mount may be frustrated by the slight tilt to the side when fully extended.It is adjustable in the following ways:1) away from the wall2) side to side3) tilting up and downIt will not adjust in a twisting fashion and it was in this dimension that it shifted. I would recommend this product with reservations for the reasons indicated above."
4,Monitor wall mount review,"Easy to install. Holds monitor firmly when you pivot up and down. Able to turn my 22"" monitor perpendicular to the wall for viewing. Solid and sturdy. Low profile when folded away. Wish arm just an inch or 2 longer for better viewing when tv is perpendicular to wall (personal quark)."
4,TV wall mount,This clamp was perfect for my new TV for my bedroom. Swivel arm is perfect for what I needed. Allows me to angle the TV to watch in bed or when at the computer desk. Just need to keep the alan wrench near by.Both bolts used to hold it into the wall became stripped at about 75% when screwing them into the stud. I should have pre-drilled the holes. I was able to tighten them up using some channel locks. The thing comes in 1 piece so besides my error of installing it was pretty easy.
1,"Defective mount, poor customer service","I purchased this mount for my 22"" Philips HDTV. I installed it, verified that it was plumb and yet the TV leaned conspicuously to the left. I tightened the screws at the arm joints until it would barely retract, but that did not solve the problem. I contacted Video Secu and they promised to send replacement washers. They never did. After I contacted them again they said that it was past the 30-day policy (which was not an issue before) and to ""go buy a new mount online""."
5,Exactly what we were looking for,"My son saved his money and bought anApex LE1912 19-Inch LCD HDTV, so I started looking for a mount that would let it be perpendicular to the wall (viewable from his bed or a chair). At local big-box stores, they ran $60-80 for the smallest mounts. This bracket did exactly what I was looking for and should even hold up to larger, heavier TVs as long as you use the included tool to somewhat tighten each joint to avoid movement that would let the TV go off of level. Yes, that reduces the ease of movement, but we don't move it often."
2,Look at different ones,"Product is cheaply made. If you extend the arm, your monitor does not remain level because of the play in the arm."
5,"Sturdy, Quality Mount for My LED Tv.","I had looked at several mounts and found some of them to be lacking in quality.However, this mount is very well built and should provide a long service life.If you need a mount of this type, look no more as this is the one for you.I will be using it in our motorhome and it should be perfect for that purpose.Thanks for the great product and very quick delivery."
3,Screws for the Mount aren't Long Enough,Everything was going great until the screws that come with the Mount weren't long enough to reach the actual 'teeth' in the Samsung Monitor I have.
5,"Excellent product, price, service!","Stunned by the price of other wall mounts, I knew there MUST be a decently engineered mount at a justifiable price. Here it is. Best of all, I had a small problem with my order... I called them and they were all over it! First rate, we all make mistakes occasionally but these folks even know exactly how to handle it. Excellent product at an excellent price with smart customer service. Yup."
4,Works the way it should,"The only downside to this product, and it is the same with all mounting kits, is the hardware (wall screws) They are crap, but replace them with something that doesn't strip out as you install it, and the swing arm itself is great. It has good reach and tilt. Installed in less than five minutes and clears up a lot of space on my desk."
5,Good Deal,"Very well constructed sturdy mount. It compares to one I saw at Walmart that sells for $50. The only problem I had was the mounting plate has VESA spacing holes of 100mm x 100mm and the 26"" TV I was putting up had 100mm x 200mm spaced holes. I had to fabricate a couple aluminum strips that mounted to the plate with holes drilled at 200mm spacing. Everything worked out just fine."
5,piece of cake,"I had no trouble with this mount.I think it is an exalent mount.I put up three of these and hung three tv's in no time at all and with out help.It hangs straight and moves easy,and stays where you put it.When I found it,I thought this can't be any good,it's too cheap,it's probably a piece of crapp.What have I got to loose,I thought,it looks good and the price was right.So I bought three of them,and I'll probably buy more.And it is NOT a piece of crapp.Very nice!"
2,"Ok, if you don't mind your monitor crooked......","Mounted to wall, used a level, Got it installed without much issue. However, after attaching monitor it is ""straight"" or level if the mounted is not extended from wall. If I pull the articulating arm out from wall the monitor wants to lean because the mount has to much play in how the arms connect. Otherwise not a bad monitor mount for the cost."
3,ok but,"good item for the money, it should have been designed to lock in place, tightening the bolts is not enough to keep stationary."
3,No head adjustment..,would be great if you could adjust the bracket that holds the tv to level it...would have given it a 5 with thqt
5,goob product,"great product the only thing is that the weight is not served in wooden furniture, but for this excellent concrete walls"
4,Well Built!!!,Well built....and for the under$15 this was one easy purchase!!! Even with the cheap screws this was a good purchase. Replace mounting screw and you save yourself valuable time.
3,Just okay,"This allowed me to hang a 23"" monitor on the side of a cabinet. However, the 'knuckle joints' do not have tight tolerances and it tilts to one side slightly when used in a certain orientation."
4,Good Wall Mount Bracket,"My husband wanted a wall mount bracket but didn't want to spend an enormous amount of money. This was fairly easy to install he said, and it seems to hold our flat screen/DVD combo tv just fine. And we can rotate the TV back and forth, so the kids can watch it while playing (in our guest room/kids play room) or our guests can watch it while lying in bed."
3,"Great price $ great product, but BIG one issue!","Great price and great product. I would give it 5 stars if not for the screws included are cheap junk!!!!. I stripped the screws in a few minutes of installing. I took me 2 hours to cut the screw off to get this off the wall.Save yourself the agony, use 2 good screws not whats included."
4,Good product execpt the wall mounting screws,"Good product, however, get yourself better wall mounting screws from your local hardware store. Even with a generous pilot hole they would break before making it half way in."
5,"Great value, great for kitchen TV viewing","The product is sturdy and easy to install, and has allowed for more cooking/work space in the kitchen. When installing, be careful to make sure that the monitor will be level as there is no rotational adjustment. Works for computer monitors as well. I recommend this product because of the price and sturdy construction."
4,Monitor Bracket,"Shipped Quick (even using Super Saver) Easy To install (2 screws) Works Great Looks Good. The only negative comment I have is the Amazon description does not mention that it has to be mounted to wall studs. I figured that out before ordering, but others may not and try to mount between studs which would not be a good thing."
4,Good value for price.,"This was perfect for my purposes, which was to mount a 19"" TV in my bedroom. I can't imagine it would work well for a heavier TV. I have kept the allen wrench handy as it loosens up when I jar it plugging in headphones, etc. and the screen rotates downward. I'm very pleased with it overall and feel it is excellent value for the price I paid ($15)."
5,Great price!,"Works perfectly for my 22 inch flat screen. Well made, very easy to install and an excellent price! Highly recommended."
4,Works well,I bought this for work. I am a test engineer and I used this to upgrade a test option on the shop floor. The operator was entering data that she was reading from a piece of equipment next to the cart where the computer monitor was located. I used this to have the monitor face her as she worked. It works very well and is built pretty well.
4,good for the price,"The mount works well for the price. It isn't designed for more than 30lbs but if you tighten up the screws enough, it seems to work for an old 45lb monitor. Two people are highly recommended for installation, as there is no easy way to attach the monitor to the mount after it's screwed into the wall. probably best to not use wall mollies for this, as it mounts with only two screws, decently long screws into studs though allows it to survive heavy loads."
3,Not for 32in TV,This bracket was marketed as for a 32 in TV. It is for smaller TV's. I think it could handle the weight of the 32in but does not have the extended brackets to attach to the back of the TV.
5,Excellent value,"The bracket attached to the TV without any problems thanks to manufacturer's foresight in providing a variety of screws in different sizes.The bracket itself is very substantial and can be easily articulated using the hex adjusting key provided.The attachment to the wall was easy, once again the manufacturer provided Expanding Plastic Sleeves and screws so that the bracket could be attached to the drywall or if possible a stud. I completed the installation in about 15 minutes.The price is right and overall an excellent value. Delivery was very speedy."
5,Nice Product,Purchased two of these. Very sturdy and easy to install. I like that you can position it where you want. Perfect for our needs and you couldn't beat the price. No complaints at all with this product.
1,Not so good,"This mount says that it will hold up to 33 pounds. Maybe for 5 seconds. I wouldn't trust this mount with anything over 10 pounds and not with any LCD or LED that you want to move often. We put a 25lb LED on it and it felt like it would break if we let go. We used a different mount that was much stronger. This we will save for a 20"" monitor that is less than 10lbs."
2,made in China,"This mount is solid, easy to install and works as expected based on the advertisement. Had I known before receiving it that it was made in China I probably would have shopped elsewhere? Just a personal preference. The country of manufacture may be why it is so inexpensive."
5,Love it!,"This is the second of these I have purchased after moving and leaving our first one in our previous home. We love it and will order another one when we move in a few years! The reason for the one star short of perfect on ""ease of installation"" is because the wall screw heads seemed awfully soft and we stripped one of them and nearly stripped the other. We got the stripped one in plenty far enough to hold the unit on the wall, but still. Besides that, perfect!!"
2,No rotation adjustment,"I purchased this mount to hang a 15"" LCD TV, weighing less than 9 pounds (the specifications rate it up to 33 lbs). I carefully measured and used a level to mount the swing arm on the wall, but when I hung the TV, the position of the arms and the small amount of ""give"" between the arm segments caused the TV to hang at a slight, but noticable, angle. You can tighten the arm segment joints, which helps the problem somewhat, but you won't be able to swing the arm around once tightened. The swivel adjustments only allow you to change the side-to-side angle and the vertical tilt, there is no way to fix the rotation of the set."
5,Monitor LCD Wall Mount,The unit worked perfect for my 22 Widescreen. Quit looking around and buy it like I did.
4,Works great!,This item is great and is standing up to the test in our bathroom. The only reason I gave 4 stars is that our wall is cement and the screws would not go in easily and is now coming out of the wall. It is nice to be able to see the TV from anywhere in the bathroom especially while taking a long hot bath. Swivels side to side and swings out. I can be set to be at different tilts and that is nice as my husband watches it while standing and shaving while watch it from the bath. Great product especially for the price.
5,Looks good works good,"I'm slightly offended that I just bought this item for $20 and today it's $18.I bought 2 and put up two 24-inch monitors. They came with the mollies needed for mounting to drywall. The instructions specifically states to mount onto a stud only, but the kit came with mollies. I used a stud for one of the mounts, and mollies for the other.Anyway, one problem with this product is that even though I lined up the top of the two bases using a laser leveler, one of the (identical) screens is higher than the other by 1 cm. I had to fix this bc it bothered me.Great product, great price. I would have gladly paid double for this product after seeing the cr*p that was available at the local stores here."
5,Very easy to install and use,"I have this mounted in my home office to hold a 22"" LCD TV above my computer monitors (so I can multi-task when doing work and watching TV).The mount is great, only two bolts and you're done. It does require being screwed into a wall stud. It comes with a supplied allen wrench to loosen/tighten the arms. The tilt feature is very nice!"
3,"Not enough for a 27""","Basic construction looks solid, but I'm taking one star for the poor quality lag bolts. The low-grade steel stripped on both from looking at cross-eyed and I had to go to Home Despot. In fact, I would go so far as to say if you buy this then go ahead and have two #12 x 2"" screws ready to go. Secondly, the Samsung 27"" that I've mounted is clearly overwhelming the mount even though it has VESA 75 and 100, and is under 30 lbs. The TV is pulling away from being flush with the wall and tilting down until it contacts the wall. Great mount for very small screens, but I wouldn't recommend it for 27"" displays."
4,Flat Screen Wall Mount,The mount was easy to install and works fine. The weight of TV was no problem even when extended to max length.
2,Not for TV's,I bought this thinking that it would fit TV's but it turns out that it will only fit computer type monitors.
3,TV wallmount,"Good design, but plate that mounts to TV needs to be bigger. Does not work with 32"" TV without using bracket extensions."
4,perfect choice,"my neighbour was the one who recommended this product after i explained what i wanted to do, in my kitchen. this was the perfect choice, i love it."
4,Does exactly what it is supposed to do!,"This wall mount does all it is supposed to do. I installed it with ease, the price was more than fair, and the machining matched the flat screen perfectly. My only suggestion is to try and secure the wall base in a stud. If you can't, then you have to use quality sheetrock anchors. All in all, I'm very pleased with the product.+"
5,installed it in 2 minutes.,"this wall mount feels very sturdy.Installation was done under two minutes, it took me longer making sure i found a stud with my stud finder.I havent tested it out with the 24 inch tv that i purchased for my sons room. Come saturday i will mount the tv into the stand but I'm not worried about any issus."
4,Works like a charm.,"I purchased this item for my garage down the shore, in an effort to hang my 15 inch television. The wall mount bracket does exactly what it was intended to do. The only problem with the overall package was the inclusion of some low quality screws. My screwdriver ate the heads of the screws, and I was forced to dig up some new ones out of my tool box. Not a big issue, but I was surprised at how low quality the screws were. Overall - 4 out of 5 stars!"
5,This turned out to be just perfect!,"I needed a kit to mount a 20"" flat screen for my elliptical to watch iFit video workouts.This was a complete kit, will fit a variety of VESA formats, and included all require hardware.I did use a stud finder to get a secure mount.Thanks much!"
5,Great product,"This is a great product. Got it just the other day and have it installed already. It's very light and installation was fast. The instructions were good enough, but the thing is essentially self explanatory. It's holding up a 22"" LED LCD in the kitchen and doing a great job. Fit and finish was great and it came with plenty of hardware for installing the mount and the TV. About the only thing I would take away from it is the 2.5"" screws it comes with; I used 3"" screws and believe it or not that .5"" matters. However, it's still a great product especially for seventeen bucks! Made in China."
5,Can;t imagine a wiall mount better for the price,"Title says it all...feels sturdy and well made....came w/ 2"" wood screws for installation...had mounted in 15 minutes. No negatives here...get one."
4,"Used it to mount a 15"" TV (7 pounds)","I used it to mount my wife's old 15"" TV in the kitchen after our cheap 5"" under-counter one died. Mounting was simple and it seems like it will support it just fine, although it's only 7 pounds. The articulating arm works smoothly after adjusting the various bolts in the arm, as it was too stiff out-of-the-box. If I was mounting a TV that was closer to the max weight, I might be a little more hesitant, since it does seem like it might sag after a while, but since this one is much lighter and kept flush to the wall when it's not in use, I don't expect any problems."
5,LCD Mounting Bracket,Was able to mount LCD TV on wall giving me more room on my desk. Great product for the money
4,I like it !,"I bought two of these for my kids rooms. However for the 26"" Emerson TV's I was hanging I had to purchase the VideoSecu MLE100B W39 TV Mount Adapter Bracket LED LCD VESA100 to VESA. I didn't know that until I ordered so needless to say I had to order the conversion kit as well and waited for it to ship to continue. The kit came quick and after some modifications to the holes, ( drilled the original holes out bigger so the TV mount locations would line up for mounting.)All said and done it is a good system once altogether and like the adjustability of the TV as it hangs on the wall."
5,Great Bracket,This bracket was easy to install and works very well. We used it on a 23' Vizio tv. It securely holds the tv in a variety of positions and then folds neatly back to the wall. We have it mounted in our kitchen and it frees up our counter. Bottom line...we liked it so much we bought another one for our bedroom. It is well made and well priced compared to most brackets sold in the big box stores.
5,Strong,Very strong product that does not damage the wall. All my tvs are wall mounted with this product that I received promptly and is of excellent quality. Good price
5,GREAT. Works exactly as it should.,"Used to mount a 24"" Toshiba Razor w/DVD player. Easy to mount. Harware included. Allows the screen to be adjusted to a large amount of variance. Stable even when fully extended from the wall. Folds flat snuly to wall.gHighly recommended."
4,It did exactly what it said - great price too,"I would of give 5 stars if it has rotation but 1 star less because of this no rotation. It is light duty only; NOT recommended for heavy monitors. It provides up down, side to side but no 360 rotate; stay at 180 adjustment. If you want exactly the same even the price plus 360 rotate; check out the ""Flat Panel Screen with VESA 100 A63"" also $14.99 I think the Vesa 100 is better because it a bit stronger and include 360 rotate. Words of caution, there are other models that exactly the same or a little cheaper but it can't rotate 360 degree so read the description carefully before you buy."
5,GREAT Item!!!! Look No More!!,"VideoSecu Articulating TV Wall Mount Bracket for VESA 100 LCD LED Flat Screen Monitor TV 1E9I had been looking for two wall mounts that I could mount my Dell 20"" monitors to the wall with. After doing some research, I decided to give this a shot. I ordered two of them and today I hung the monitors on the wall using the included hardware. Well let me tell you that not only are these made well, they installed with NO issues!! I had them up in no time at all. As long as you measure correctly and use a level, you should have no issues. Once up on the wall, I tightened the allen screws a bit. They are level and secure. You will find other wall mounts out there for 2 to 3 times the amount but I promise you....you can't go wrong with these. I would highly recommend them. Great Product + Great Price = WIN!!!"
5,Great deal!,"As others have said, this is nice piece. It is solid, appears reasonably well-made and comes packed properly. I will replace the screws rather than risk stripping them like others have said they did. This is an incredible deal given the price."
5,Easy to set up,I use this mount with the ‚ÄúCoby LEDTV1526‚Äù and it works great. Easy install!5 Stars for easy install and very few parts.
2,Blocks plugs,"It's probably more of the TV's fault. But, this mount blocked my antenna and power cord slots for my Phillips 22"". I bought the JLAB and could plug in everything."
4,Great wall mount but buy your own screws!,"This is a nice mount for my 22"" LCD. Just make sure you buy your own screws. The ones that it comes with strip very easily."
5,Just what we were looking for,It does exactly what we wanted from this wall mount. Our office ordered two more after the first one and it got to our office a day early both times. We were extremely happy with the product and extremely happy with the delivery.John
5,Quality TV wall mount,Why spend $50-$100 on a wall mount at local retailers when you can spend only $15 on this one. The construction is the same as the more expensive ones in the stores. For the people that have purchased and said there is a little unlevelness when installed. There is an allen wrench provided with the wall mount. Snug up all screws before you mount and there will be no problem.
4,almost perfect...,"A very nice, well built arm at a terrific price! Only complaint is that the aluminum mounting screws are way too soft and both heads stripped before fully fastened and had to be extracted with vise grips, and replaced with better quality screws."
4,excellent!,"This mount installed and works like a charm.quite sturdy and well made, fits perfectly with my old monitor.the only thing is the monitor doesn't rotate 360 degrees. no biggie ."
5,Very Satisfied,"I purchased this wall mount for a Viore 22"" HDTV. It works perfectly. I was easily able to mount the TV and position it the way I wanted. Other reviews have noted a problem with the TV tilting slightly after it was mounted. I encountered this at first, but then realized that in attaching the mounting plate back on the mounting arm that I had not reinstalled the washers. After I reinstalled the washers there was no tilting problem at all. This was a great purchase."
5,Fantastic ROI,"I am extremely satisfied with this product. For small televisions (>= 33lbs, 15kg) I cannot imaging a better horizontally adjustable tilting mount for the money. It is of very sturdy construction; I was a little surprised by how heavy it is. It installed very very simply with a drill and level.The only rather weird thing is that the instructions very clearly state in bold, underlined, capitalized, and red letters ""DO NOT USE MOLLIES"", and yet the screw bag contains two plastic expansion hangers which are even less sturdy than molly bolts.That curiosity aside, I would recommend this mount to anyone with a smaller TV to hang, where vertical adjustment is not a requirement."
5,A+,"I bought this based on other reviews and it did not disappoint. What a bargain. A quality, sturdy wall mount for my 23"" Samsung for $20, WOW. Easy install. Verrrry satisfied. A diamond in the rough."
5,Perfect!,"Yes, this was a little trick to install.A two person job for sure.Put Really, any tv wall brace is two person job.The swivel movement works great, our tv is moved and turned several times a day.You just can't beat the price!Can not find these anywhere locally for under $50.Will be ordering more as we get more flat screen TV's in the bedrooms!"
5,Wall mount,"Good prices, works perfectly. Using it for my kitchen tv, am able to position the tv everyway so we can see it from wherever we are working in the kitchen."
5,great sounds,"the dubplates have that echoey sound that sound systems like, and sharp hard tones, it adds almost a mysticism to his voice. Garnett Silk made plates for everyone (stone love, waggy t), but there is something special about these, you can hear it in him, and the last track, which is a very old (and somewhat scratchy but nicely bassey) track of Garnett taking Whitney's where do broken hearts go and turning it into an evil dubplate is excellent. Unfortunately, Splashing Dashing (my favorite garnett track) is essentially not where it says it is, as the song tapers off as soon as he starts in on that gem. Good duo with tony rebel, also great tracks like Lionheart, and even some humor as he uncharacteristically starts to chat and breaks off into a laugh on track 2; very sweet."
4,Nice and easy book,"The only thing that you will have of this book is a nice time, of course is one of the things that you want while reading a book, the story of Luke and Faithe is like a fairy tale, (you don't know what part could be real or not), but with this story you can just relax and read.The main story will keep you reading but is not exactly a page turner book, so I recommend this book for your vacations or in a long flight."
2,watch the model,"First off, Garmin mount are not particularly good quality & will break if dropped. In addition, I linked to this product from the related accessories on the Garmin Nuvi 550 page. It is not the correct mount for that product. If you clicked this link from any page other than a 200 series, this is probably the wrong mount."
1,worked for 8 days,"Clearly a common flaw, the suction cup tore away from the mount after eight days. I installed this and left it alone. I didn't take it off of my windshield once before it fell off on its own. Obviously this is a hit or miss product manufactured by a company with some quality control issues. I got a bad one, you might get lucky."
1,Only had it up a few days and fell apart. Piece of junk dont buy.,Came with both pieces suction and mount. Seemed to be exactly what i needed. But only after a few days it just fell off the window and dropped my gps on the dash.The suction cup stayed on window but the rubber piece that connects the suction cup to the mount just split and tore apart without even touching it. i hope it didn't mess my gps unit up. Contacted seller to see about refund. Will update as i go along.
2,"Good company, bad product",The holder was shipped promptly and as promised. It looked to be of good quality and it fit my 255W well. The ball and socket were tight. The suction cup failed within a month in a car that was barely used and garage kept. It should have had a good life. The rubber portion tore free of the rest of the suction cup and made it completely useless. Chargercity got the extra star for the hassle free return and refund of our money. Now we are trying the more expensive holder from them. I hope it works!!
1,Suction cup broke on first use,The suction cup base ripped the first time I used the mount. Many other reviewers had the same experience. Don't bother with this product.
3,convenience,This product is so convenient to swap between cars and it is hassle free to support your Garmin. I like the way it can be manipulated to create the best view while driving.
3,Good choice.,"It does its job. The grip is not tight enough that GPS was dropped twice over 1 year. I uses my GPS everyday. However, I just use it since my old one dose not stick to window anymore. You might be able to exchange grip with original one.I did not try yet."
1,Horrible,Horrible productLooked very cheap and was very tight to fit the gpsThe cup holder broke within a monthWaste of money
5,Perfect!,This is just what I needed to replace the one that went missing. It arrived in time for my trip and worked great.
2,You get what you pay for...,I give it 2 stars. Each star for the amount of months it lasted.One day the suction cup section just cracked and fell apart one day while I was trying to remove it from my windshield.Next time I will just pay the 15 or so bucks for the original Garmin mount.
2,Broke on first use,I used it thei past weekend. I went into a convenience store and left it mounted to the windshield. Upon coming back to my car the suction cup had come off and split where it connects. I am not sure if i can purchase another suction cup or maybe even super glue it... Not worth my mone.
1,Suction cup broke off on first use,"Just like the tons of other people, on the first use the suction cup broke off. The Garmin ones I have used did not have any of these problems. It lasted less than an hour and was not subject to high heat or anything."
2,Missing Part,"I got everything ""technically"" shown in the picture but what you are missing here is the metal plate the the sucksion cup sucks. No luck getting the sucksion cup to hold directly on my dashboard. You also need the metal disk that haderes to directly to the dashboard giving the cup a smooth surface for secure grip."
5,just what I needed,"I purchased 3 other dashboard mounts for my Garmin, and none worked. I finally found this one on Amazon, and it was the one that worked. I even tried the Garmin website, and couldn't order it. I paid for quick delivery, and it arrived the day before I left on a 3000 mile trip. Thank you. Having that suction cup mount made the trip so much easier."
1,waste of money,don't waste your money on this product it is a waste of money the mount is so loose and it don't stay sticked to the windshield so basically it's not worth the money
2,Different from original - NOT RECOMMENDED,"This product works. But it is a little tougher to get the ball in the socket than the one that came with the Nuvi origionally. Not only does the ball not fit in the socket, the suction cup stinks. It fell off my window during my driving.I would not recommend this product to other buyers. BUY THE OFFICIAL ONE FROM GARMIN, ITS WORTH THE EXTRA MONEY, TRUST ME , I HAD BOTH!Seller was good, honest, no problems there, but product was not the same as the original Nuvi Suction cup mount, and definitely isn't as good as the one that comes with the product. Good seller, bad product."
2,Suction Cup Broke,It was an awesome product for about 1 month until the suction cup broke off. The cup was on my window and my gps was on the floor. Just glad it didnt break the garmin
4,It is ok,"It works but the cheap plastic breaks easily, I am on number three now (which is being healed together with a band-aid), and i am getting sick of buying them."
1,Product not durable,This product lasted less than a month for us. The previous clip we had with the original Garmin Nuvi purchased lasted 5 years before we broke it. Now I have to go order another one.
1,Not great at all,"The priduct didn't last but a week, and i had to buy another one. The suction tore and is not any good"
5,Just what I needed,"I had broken my old one and tried touse the weighted bags, but this is without a doubt the better way to go."
4,Garmin Suction Cup Mount,So far this works great. Left my original in a reantal car. Read reviews and decided to order this one.
1,Disappointment,"Suction cup was torn; therefore, mount didn't work. It was given as part of a gift so that just added to the disappointment. I would have given it 0 stars, but the software wouldn't allow for it."
2,Not Like The Original,"My Garmin Nuvi 255 originally came with one of these. Almost 4 years of hard use had gone by when the suction lever finally wouldnt tighten the pad enough onto my windshield. So... time for a replacement, right? I LOVED this style mount because the GPS was in a normal range of view and it was simple to use. Purchased one identical to the original. However, I was sorely disappointed. Even once removing the factory plastic from the suction pad it refused to hold steady onto the clean windshield surface. Now looking at alternative mounts because Im tired of driving with my GPS in my lap or having the GPS on this mount fall off while on the highway and roll under foot."
5,Great Deal!,I am quite happy with my purchase. The suction cup mount arrived on time and fits perfectly on my Garmin GPS. Great people to do business with!
1,BROKE IN ONE USE,We purchased this for a trip and it broke on the window we put it on for no reason. Made cheaply would recommend buying. Waste of money all and all. Should have believed the other reviews I read.
1,Inferior Quality,"during the 4th use the suction cup fell off the rest of the mount. It looked like substandard materials were used for this mount. Too bad, it was working great until this happened."
1,Don't buy this one!,I have ordered two of these and the suction part breaks after each use! What a rip off. Ordering now straight from Garmin.
1,Piece of junk,"This product is a piece of junk. Third time I used it, the bracket fell apart where it clips onto the ball mount. Also, the suction cup does not work as well as my original Garmin product. I don't use it often because the GPS is mostly in my other car so there has been very little stress. Beware - this is NOT an original Garmin part. Spend a buck more for the genuine item."
1,Terrible product!,"Really, really bad design. Totally useless piece of junk. The ball does NOT snap into the socket in the cradle not matter how you try. I cant believe a reputable company like Garmin would degrade their product by putting something like this with it!! Y"
1,Mine broke too!,"As others before me have remarked, this mount breaks VERY EASILY. Within two months of purchasing this product, the plastic lever snapped off rendering the whole thing useless. Since so many others have expressed the same complaint, I'm not sure the mount is worth purchasing -- perhaps look elsewhere!"
2,Garmin Vehicle Suction Cup for Nuvi 265W,I used it once and it worked just fine. This product is not from Garmin. It looks like an overseas copy.
1,Waste,"The item came without base plate sticker , without that it is useless. Unfortunately I opened the package after the time limit to return, So I couldn't return it. Later I found many more reviews with the same complaint, that means they are selling like this purposely."
1,Ball Joint does not work,"The ball does not snap into the socket even with a lot of force. When you think its in there, the stand does not rotate freely and pops out after a few rotations. Seller wont even pay for shipping on the return of a defective product."
1,The Negative Reviews Were Right,"I used this for less than two months, and one day I was putting it on the windshield, and it just broke. The plastic broke that holds the plastic suction cup and the rest of the device together. I had no problems with suction, as some people did, but for it to break within two months, and as seldom as I used it, was very bad.Luckily it was cheap, because in two months I'm sure most people have thrown away the packaging, and won't bother to return. I'll shop elsewhere."
2,Missing bracket,"I received only the suction cup mount, but not the bracket shown in the picture, my order looks like item 010-10747-00 from Garmin, which is only the mount. This obivously makes the mount useless, since I'm purchasing this mount to replace one that was stolen. I'm still trying to figure out if it was a mistake from Amazon, or the item does not come with the bracket. I would rather have purchased this directly from Garmin, since now Amazon is giving me headache and money loss from having to return the item for refund."
1,piece of junk,No sooner had I mounted the new garmin GPS in my car than the rubber suction cup cracked rendering this whole device worthless. It lasted me all of 15 seconds before it failed. I felt totally ripped off.
1,WARNING! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"My wife purchased this item for me as a gift, and when I opened it and tried to apply it to my windshield, it immediately fell. There was absolutely NO suction at all to hold the mount in place. The item was totally defective. And since it was a gift, and I had not opened it until Christmas, we were past the date allowed in which to return the item. I know it's only a waste of $4, but I still feel as if we should have at least received a product that actually worked as advertised. So we would warn you against buying the item from this company. It would be well worth the extra money to buy it directly from Garmin instead of wasting your time with the defective product shipped by this company."
1,Poor Quality,Within 4 months of getting this mount it broke. The part that the ball fits into (ring part) broke. I would rather see the actual metal version that shipped with my Nuvi be available.
2,works but not great,"When using this product on the windshield when it's really cold out, it has a tendency to fall off and will not stick again till it warms up"
4,Good Fit - Works well,Exactly what I needed to hold the GPS. Fit the GPS and fits my vehicle. Works well for use in my Honda Civic.
4,Prefer the gravity mount,"If you have to mount to the windshield, this will do the trick. Our old one lost suction after a few years so we bought this as a replacement. If you can set it on the dash, I more prefer the gravity mount as it won't suddenly fall off in heat or cold like this can."
3,Garmin Pops Out,"The company sent out the product very quickly, the suction part works well, but the Garmin pops out constantly (for no reason)."
2,Suction cup issues,"The suction cup on my unit has a basically unremoveable protective plastic film. I've been trying to get it off for a couple of days and I've had limited success.If I can't get it off with some goo gone tonight, I'm done with this thing."
5,A pricey replacement but what can you do?,At nearly $20 replacing your windshield bracket is a bit pricey but when you need one you need one. At least the item I purchased was 100% exactly like the original--no difference at all. This one I will take better care of. But a great product and fast shipment as always from Amazon.
3,It is what it is,"The quality is not as good as the one that came with the Garmin, but it is a suction cup mount, so no big deal."
3,Decent product,"I purchased this mount because the one I originally had was stolen. I ordered it from my smart phone while I was in Best Buy. The BB price was almost $18 and this one was only $.04!! I did have to pay $4.95 for shipping but I would say that it was worth the discounted price. The fit is not perfect for the Garmin I currently own, but it works well enough its not going to fall off the window or fall out of the mount. Definately worth saving over 70% off the retail price."
4,Does what I needed.,"I received a cast-off Garmin GPS unit when the original bracket failed. I ordered this item, received it promptly, assembled and installed it easily, and for at least the first few uses it has worked perfectly. I generally only have my GPS mounted in the car when I expect to need it, so I attach and remove the suction cup regularly. Through the first several cycles I see no reason to anticipate a loss of suction, or vulnerability of the small lever one uses to create suction. At this price it is hard to argue with."
2,Does not stick to the window well,"It does not work as well as the original suction cup that came with the garmin. Well, i only paid 4 dollars....so i guess i got what i paid for."
4,Not bad,"First off, for the money this thing does the trick. If you are expecting it to come in factory Garmin packaging, you will be let down. This is NOT an OEM part, however, it does what its supposed to do. The ball fits into the socket maybe a little too tight, and any adjustment after mounting the unit on the windshield may take two hands. Being in Houston we have had extreme temp. ranges in the last couple of weeks. From 80 down to around 30. With the windows rolled up it has seemed to hold suction fine.For the money I think it is a ""buy""."
5,Good mount,"This is a replacement I had to buy after a friend lost the original one. It fits in nicely and has a tighter hold than my previous store bought mount, which would often fall off the dashboard while I maneuvered sharp turns!A useful add on for my Garmin GPS.Thumbs up for this!"
2,Garmin Suction Cup Mount,The part that holds the GPS is too small for my 500? It has to stretch and is bowed tight...
1,Doesn't stick for very long!,"I purchased my Garmin nuvi 200w back in November 2007 and I had to order almost 5 different suction cups since then because every few months it would just STOP sticking to my dashboard, and loudly fall down every 10-15 minutes (that is especially dangerous if you are driving on a long trip and need to pay attention to the road). I am thinking of putting super glue on the latest one to make it stick. Unfortunately my GPS isn't covered by warranty anymore so I can't get more free mounts.I definitely do NOT recommend this mount because it only sticks to the plate very well for up to 2 months then suddenly stops. It is not worth the hight cost!"
1,Not the actual Garmin mount!,I ordered this thinking that it was the exact type of mount I originally had with my Garmin Nuvi. I received a huge mount that is inconvenient and ugly. Beware! I should have spent the extra money to purchase directly from the Garmin website!.
1,Clip doesn't fit my stand....or even the suction part it came with!,"I wonder if the item varies from order to order, but the clip I received did not fit on a Garmin bean bag stand I purchased previously. Here's the best part: it doesn't even the suction part it came with.Be careful before buying."
1,"Garbage, do not buy!!!!!!","Do not waste your time buying these windshield mounts for a Garmin GPS. They are garbage. The only reason I gave them a one star rating is due to the fact that there is nothing lower. As far as construction they are fine but, the protective plastic that covers the suction cup is extremely hard to remove. It is like it is glued on. It took me about ten minutes to remove it. I had to remove the little pieces with a pair of tweezers. I made the mistake of buying four of these to have on hand. I ended up throwing them away and buying a factory Garmin mount from Garmin. I should have realized that the price was too cheap for them to be any count. If you purchase these after reading my review then you deserve what you get. I did not read any reviews or I would have left well enough alone. Although, they cost quite a bit more from Garmin.com, you will be much happier."
2,RR,Gift. My son did not like it that much and I cannot elaborate on it any further. Need to change your required amount of words!
1,garmin suction cup,Am upset with this one because the suction cup does not grib on that vechile sucaion toplllllll how is that am sold the wrong item and the mount wont lock inside the mount.
1,suction cup doesn't stick,"It worked for a few weeks. But then the suction cup failed after a few seconds to a few minutes on the windscreen. It's almost comical. I recommend you look elsewhere and don't hope it will work for you -- that's what I did, and it didn't."
2,Doesn't suck!,"After using the product a few times, I can't get the suction cup to stay in place on the windshield consistently."
3,My fault,I didn;'t catch the size limitations when I ordered and these are too small for the size of GPS I own.
1,cheap china made product,"when it arrived, the first time I set this sucker up, it basically broke into 6 pieces.The suction plastic also fell off and the locking lever separated from the round base.It really uses cheap plastic and cheap parts. Therefore a cheap product.Important to mention it never fell off, it was never used. It just didn't make it that far from the shipping box. Luckily I was near a trash can to avoid myself from leaving it in the garage collecting dust forever"
1,wrong ordered item,The item ordered did not fit the device I have. It would cost me more to return than just file 13 it.
4,Garmin GPS Mount,I loved the mount until my mother got her hands on it. She went to take it down for whatever reason and the Cup broke off from the rest of the mount. But I was very happy with it while it was still on the windshield..
2,You get what you pay for,"I would not purchase this again, I would probably look for a mount made by Garmin. The quality of the suction cup is pretty low. It tends to loose suction within about 5 minutes. Luckly I found my original mount and am back to using the mount that came with the device."
5,Point me in the direction,"Great to have an extra GPS mount to have in my other vehicle and, for the price, is worth having extras to take on business trips for rental cars.OEM replacement is of great qualityHighly recommend"
1,dissatisfied,"I am planning to return this item -- it did not adhere to the car windshield, and in short order broke. Poor construction. Please advise vendor RMA procedure so that this can be returned."
1,Very Poor Quality,"I purchased a repalcement mount for my Garmin GPS in from Semsons & Co. Inc. and it failed the within two weeks of use. The item was listed as a Garmin Suction Cup Mount by Garmin, but it was obviously a low quality copy item and not OEM quality. The rubber on the suction cup failed within 10 uses. My original suction mount that came with the Garmin GPS lasted approximately 2 years with heavy use. Avoid the temptation to purchase any identified pieces listed as Garmin from this vendor."
1,Broke the very first time it was used.,Item broke the very first time it was used - rubber part detached from moving plastic lever rendering whole contraption useless. Seller does not offer exchanges only returns but that makes no sense - quite obviously those mount are made to fail - I had original Garmin mount that lasted for couple years before it was displace. The mounts sold by Amazon are some sort of counterfeit lookalikes. No wonder they cost 18 cents. Stay away - this is cheap Chinese junk at it's best.
1,PURE JUNK,I bought several of these as gifts. NOT ONE of them lasted more than three days! The rubber that attached the unit to the windshield ripped on every single one causing the gps's to land either on the dash or the floor board. Complete impostor junk.
5,great product,nice product.good value for moneyI recieved my GPS suction cup holder much earlier than estimated time of arrival and it works so much better than the one that came with that GPS unit it was always losing suction and falling off....so as far so good product. Highly recommended.
5,"Complete Garmin Accessory, with bracket",I read a lot of bad review where bracket is missing. My order shown up with everything included in package as expected and working fine so far.
2,Didn't fit my GPS,"I purchased this mount before we went on a trip and could never get the GPS to stay in the cradle. It is advertised as fitting the model I have, the Nuvi 205W but it doesn't work and would not stay on the dashboard. Maybe it works for some, but not for me."
1,Junk,"This item is junk. The mount fell apart after 1 use. The suction cup separated from the plastic mount which is what happened to my original after 4 years. This is a problem with all of the knockoff types. I have ended up buying the replacement part directly from Garmin. I would stay away from these knockoffs. I did not expect to use this for very long, hoping to get a year or so out of it but was not expecting it to last just 1 use. Our seller was great and shipped very fast."
1,Junk,"I received the item and 10 minutes after using it, it actually broke and dropped the GPS on the dashboard. Poorly designed."
1,piece of junk,Brook on the very first day I start using it.Did not look like it was genuine Garmin product.Don't waste your money on piece of junk.
3,its ok,It works till the sun heats the glass. Seriously its not worth $15. I dont understand why companies stick it to their loyal customers by jacking the acessory prices so high. This isnt the 90's.
4,Garmin Suction cup,Got the product in a short time and have been using it for over a month without it dropping hold once. Very satisfied.Just be carefull when ordering to get the right model. I ordered one that does not flex unwillingly but it work well with the unit I have so I kept it.
4,Was a replacement piece,"I bought this garmin accessory as a replacement piece from the original garmin I purchased several years ago. It still falls off the windshield periodically, but it gets the job done for the most part."
5,OEM quality and functions as expected.,"This is a simple suction cup mount, but it works perfectly. The quality is definitely OEM."
4,WIndow Suction Mount for Garmin,Where did my old suction mount go? I must have lost it in a baggage inspection at airport.So I found this one at Amazon...All you really want to know is DID IT WORK? The answer is YES !!! So it's a good deal.
3,Not as good as the one from Garmin,"The ball-socket joint fits too tightly, and makes a squeaking noise every time I try to move the GPS around when mounted. I guess it will loosen up over time, but until then I'll have to deal with this some other way... maybe some grease to lubricate the joint perhaps?"
2,3d Time is a Bust,"This is the third mount I have purchased for my Garmin 265. The first one lasted about 6 months and then began to fall (lose suction) after 2-3 minutes.The second and third never did ""stick"" for more than 5 minutes. I even used different ""discs"" for the mounting (two in my truck and one in my wife's car) and none of the three will hold at all.I am buying something else."
2,Suction piece doesnt work,I bought this because the bracket piece was lost in a car accident. I bought this to replace it and the suction cup piece will not stick to the windshield even in the locked position. Luckily I still have the factory model suction piece.
1,Not worth the effort,"This product, a replacement Garmin Mount, broke 10 days after I received it. I then had to buy the Garmin one locally for at least double the cost. Then I had to return the broken one which is a hassle. Don't waste your time or money on this item."
1,"Poor Quality, broken after about a month","It worked well for about the first 10 uses, then it broke. The suction cup tore away from the hard plastic, rendering it useless. Don't waste your money!!!"
1,It cracked in 1 month,I used it for 1 month and yesterday I found it came out. The rubber base which hold the wind shield glass teared off. Its a poor quality item. Will not recommend to buy.
3,NOT JUST FOR ANY GARMIN,"Pay attention to be sure it will work with your model. I made the mistake of assuming that Garmin has a standard mount. Not so. I could have returned it because Amazon is always there for us. However, it was my mistake and not worth the time or return postage to exchange it. Good Luck!"
3,not as good a fit as the one shipped with the GPS unit.,"In my dotage, I neglected to pack the original mount before departing on a journey that would keep me away from home for several months. Purchased this to fill the void, but it was extremely difficult to get the GPS unit to snap into the mount. I nearly cracked the case, but finally was able to put it together. Getting it back apart was even more difficult. I suspect that these mounts may be test fitted prior to packaging and any that are too tight or too loose are rejected for each specific unit. Finally, I simply do not disconnect the GPS from the mount and just take the entire assembly into the house at night gor security."
4,Affordable and works!,"it works good. however every once in a while it would pop off but that is not a big problem for me. i would only use it once in a while on a trip or to a different place in town. 4 stars for minor inconvenience of popin off, it's not perfect. I'm very happy with the price and would recomend to you."
4,great replacement,i needed a replacement because my suction cup broke so not its great. the clip didnt fit my gps so i just clipped the old on onto it.
1,Disappointment,I thought that the price was to good to be true and I was right. I used this 1 time and the rubber suction cup ripped off of the spring that holds everything together. This should not have broken after one use. This is the second time this has happened. I guess you get what you pay for.
1,Do not buy it!!!,Suction cup ripped in less than 24 hours. Should have bought the original one. Don't waste your time and money. Don't buy it.
1,GPS Mount worthless,I was extremely disappointed with this purchase. On the second day of use the rubber suction cup peeled away from the mount causing the GPS to fall off the windshield. Apparently the weight of the GPS was too much for it. Keep in mind that this was the correct model GPS that this mount was designed for so clearly the rubber was shoddy.
1,Not really worth it,"I left my original GPS dock in a rental car and decided to try this one out. I figured I wouldn't be out too much money if it fell apart. Well, it did, after only removing it about three times. I suppose this would be alright if you always leave it in one place but if you move from rental to rental like I do, it is no good. The rubber is not well attached to the plastic so it tears off after only a few moves. Just spring for one of the more expensive ones and save the time."
1,Broken - lasted about six months!,"See attached picture of the broken holster - the plastic tangs in the ball 'receiver' broke. Our OEM Garmin mount lasted for years, in fact the only reason I bought this replacement was because we lost the original. My advice is to avoid this particular model and go OEM."
2,INcomplete,Product description fails to include that it comes without the plate that it sticks to so that u are only getting the suction cup and if u dont have a glass dashboard it has nothing to stick to. I went and purchased that separately.
1,Mount rubber is not of high quality,"My Mount rubber gave up, it broke apart when i tried to remove it from the car windshield after releasing the air vaccum. would have used it for 15 trips max"
2,Works as advertised but ....,"What else can you say except they do exactly what they are supposed to do. However, they only last about one year before the suction cup rips away from the metal backup. I am now on number three. Unfortunately, there is no other option. How can Garmin make such a great GPS and such a sorry suction cup?"
5,Had a problem- promptly fixed,"First one came with a plastic wrap that was stuck to the suction cup, making it unusable. Talked with the company and they had a new one out the next day. New one was perfect- no plastic covering. All good!"
2,"Man, what the crap....","The suction cup tore away from mount within 2 months. It wasn't taken up and down or abused, just slowly started tearing away. Worked good up until then, but now its worthless. :("
2,Was working well...until it broke,"I don't often review items I purchase on Amazon, but this one wasn't so great, so I felt compelled to get the word out. I purchased this suction cup mount after the original that came with my Nuvi 250 broke where the rubber meets the hard plastic at the base. It worked well for a month or so, almost too well. The suction was very strong (mounted on the dashboard disk that was included with my Nuvi) and recently, when I tried to engage the suction, the plastic lever in the back snapped off. I would probably have rated this item with 1 star had I not still had my old mount and could replace the lever from that one. Overall, not good. I bought this mount because everywhere else I looked, the prices seemed too high for a plastic mount... but as I have read in many reviews on Amazon: you get what you pay for."
5,Best history book available on the 911,"The author really knows these cars. He's owned them, driven them, and even raced them for the factory.There's a huge amount of technical information, but its presented in a informative and well-written way. The chapter on engine development is worth the price of the book alone; every design change is described and explained.Perhaps the only critisism is that Paul Frere likes the 911 too much. The disasterious self-leveling suspension episode isn't really mentioned, nor are the many problems that have occured with the 2.7 litre cars in the hotter climates of the USA.Overall this is a great book; if you have any technical interest at all 911s, this is the book to get."
2,Disappointing organization of book,"The information in this book is detailed and extensive. However I prefer a model by model organization of material but instead the author has chosen to organize by Engine, Transmission, Body, etc. This make the material really hard to use when you are trying to compare a car of a particular year with another. You are constantly switching between chapters of Engine, Transmission, etc. I also was disappointed by the sparse use of photographs. This books looks like it started out a long time ago and has been added to through the years without rethinking the layout of the information.By contrast, the book on the Porsche Boxster by the same author has a much better organization by chronlogical introduction of the different models. Within each chapter are the details on changes to the engine, transmission, body, etc. The pictures are also much better."
2,Gives the story but when did it happen?,I had a hard time finding dates for each change in design. Why not say that the last air cooled porsche was made in 1995 when the body change occurred in 1994? All the book says is with the such and such model came the model such and such transmission. When? Dates are lacking but a good detailed accounting of the changes to Porsche 911.
2,Again just another boring 911 book,"For those seeking references and technical data on their 911, skip this book. First time opening the book, I have already seen all the data and pics from OLDER Porsche books. There's barely pictures in this book anyhow. For those seeking good history and techincal data for the early Porsche's, get the Brain Long books."
1,"Really, Really Bad- Their WORST record.","As a devoted Mouse on Mars fan who has all of their recordings, I was crushed when I bought this disc. It is so dissapointing- a huge departure from their previous work. While still very inventive, they apply their looped cut-up technique to vocal samples, in an artless way.Innovative? Yes.Groundbreaking? Yes.Painful? Yes.Listenable? No.It's just poorly done, and most of MOM's fans agree. If you are new to Mouse On Mars, I'd reccomend Iaora Tahiti, Autoditacker, Idiology or Vulvaland over this. Actually, I'd reccomend ANY of their recordings over this one."
1,The Worst Flavor,"I've tried 7 of the other flavored Big 100 bars from Met-Rx, and they were all mind-blowingly delicious, like candy bars. This one though, tasted pretty awful. Not like cookie dough, and not like peanut butter. More like I would expect silly putty to taste, like chemical treated plastic. I had two and tried giving the rest of them away to people at my gym. Everyone took one, no one came back for a second. I'd say they failed the taste test.If you're looking for peanut butter flavors, go withMet-Rx Big Colossal Peanut-Butter Pretzel Bar, 3.52 oz. (pack of 12), it's fantastic, and I've gone through a dozen boxes of those in the last year. Maybe they just spoiled my taste buds for anything else."
3,Get the peanut buttrer pretzel,"If you've eaten other brands of protein bars, this one will taste good to you. It's a little chewy. But it doesn't nearly stack up to the peanut butter pretzel crunch. Get that one for sure. The pretzel one is crunchy like a sweet and salty and it's awesome."
3,they fill you up,taste great really chewy and they fill you up but not sure how fresh they are especially the chocolate ones we got
1,I would rather eat cardboard,"I bought a package of these for the mere convenience of having them at work. You're better off eating something out of the garbage. If you're looking for something that has nutrients, protein, etc. but is also edible/drinkable stick with GNC's Amplified Wheybolic Extreme 60 Vanilla. 60 grams of protein, not including milk, and just as tasty as a vanilla shake...seriously."
5,Bolshoi and Beyond,"It never ceased to amaze me that these guys just did not get the respect they deserved. Met them back in the day, opening for Love and Rockets. I ran into Trevor a few years back at a Celtic Festival, still making great music. I heard that Paul is on the west coast, still doing electronika, but that may be rumor.Bolshoi fans should definitely check out Trevor's solo stuff, as well as his Celtic bands, Celtic Soul & Rathkeltair.Tune into RadioIO 80s on the net for LOTS of Bolshoi classics."
4,Friends...,"I was introduced to this album via WUSM radio (now defunct- R.I.P.) circa 1984? I woke up to it one morning and was just awake enough to slide a cassette (remember those?) into the tape deck. Very glad that I did... It's something reminiscent of every '80s band you ever heard, but way, way better. Probably closest to the Cure, if anything...but doesn't quite sound like them either...meh."
3,Whatever happened to the Bolshoi?,"...I expected to find this album was a disappointing piece of fluff and my love of it then was the folly of youth. Not so. A couple of songs are very lame (Waspy for example). But all in all, it is very enjoyable. Compare to the more contemporary music of James."
1,Did not work for me,"The ""om nama shivaya"" chant is great, but there is a flute solo intertwined with it that sounds like a jazz piece -- and is totally disruptive for me, completely breaks the meditative mood. I don't know why Gass added it. A pity, since so many of his other albums are great for meditation."
5,Very Cool!,"I love these dishes, they are like the Cadillac of dishes. Be aware that they are more purple than what is shown in the photos. The bowls are hard to adjust to eating cereal in, I wish they offered a cereal bowl in this pattern."
2,Difficult to put together!,"I loved the idea of the 3-in-1 idea, but when I actually got it out of the box to put it together, I changed my mind! I read over the directions numerous times, but only certain steps have pictures to go with them, and that makes it very difficult to assemble. I would not recommend trying to put this together if you are short on patience and lots of time!"
2,not a good choice,The speakers were not loud enough and only lasted a couple of years before not working at all.
5,Great Video for those with limited mobility,This is a wonderful way to exercise even when you are seated in a chair. A well done and encouraging workout.
3,Microsoft Project 4.0,An excellent tool to develop timelines and plan projects. Could use some additional upgrades to make it more user friendly and comprehensive.
5,Last cd?!,I believe this was Phrancs last cd...Which is too bad as She had a great voice and made some fun cds! This one is no exception...Highly recommended!
2,Can't get enough of Elvis,I also bought this DVD at Wal-Mart. The interviews were great and I found out a lot of information I did not know about Elvis. It is wonderful hearing of all the great and generous things Elvis did. I also was glad to hear of the on going generosity by Lisa Marie and Priscilla. The reason for my low rating is the picture quality of the photos and film footage used is horrible. I also expected to hear Elvis songs in the background-instead they used some off the wall music.
4,Great little DVD,"This is a wonderful little DVD, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I have over 100 DVD and VCR tapes of Elvis and this one is special."
3,Nothing really new,"Most of the content in this DVD appears in other Elvis-related materials. However, I like the focus on Elvis' generosity. As a primer for someone who doesn't know this side of Elvis, it is pretty good. Long live his blessed memory in any way, shape or form!"
3,Always Elvis,This is a fairly good documentary onElvis. Some of the folks talk toomuch but overall it is a goodDVD to have if you are an Elvisfan. I was at Graceland on openingday (a long time ago) and I heardstories over and over about howgood and kind he was.
5,was what i expected,just what i was looking for works great... thank you again for a great product....will use for my needs on my dept. 56 houses
2,Doesn't fit Dept 56 houses!!,"I have numerous dept 56 houses and thought this would be great to cut down on the number of cords I have to use. But the bulbs supplied are too wide and short for all but one house (I have over 20 houses, so this seems strange to me). The light bulbs that came with each house were a bit narrower and the base of each was taller to reach inside the house. It just seems that an expensive dept 56 product like this should more consistently fit dept 56 houses. It is all but useless to me. I gave it 2 stars because it did work with the 3 accessory items. I would like to see them make a product that lights more accessory items as I have many of them, too!"
5,Clever idea and useful,I really use this and think it is a very good way to speed up your reloading. A handy item although you could survive without it if you are on a budget.
4,A little change...,"While Tim Reynolds is known to most of us as the ""sixth member of the Dave Matthews Band"", he is in fact, his own artist. Not signed to any current record label, traveling in a van instead of a bus, and playing small clubs may seem to some people as ""amateur"", while in fact he is one of the most unique artists of this generation. With the skills of quite possibly the best guitarist today, he continues to blow away his fans with his unique style. And while I myself am not a big fan of the sometimes pop genre, I rather enjoy the acoustic feel of his music."
3,Half good and half God-awful,"There are 14 tracks on this album. Seven of which are beautiful, wistful acoustic melodies which will sweep you away...if you're into that. The other seven are I suppose what one would call ""trance."" Very experimental and by no means easy to listen to. I would get it just for the acoustic half though. It's worth it for that."
3,Just being honest,"I really enjoy the acoustic songs on this album. Although they are not technically perfect they speak of his good sense of style and mood. I don't think a comparison to any other artist is necessary, or beneficial... if you want people to listen to leo kottke it's not going to help by bashing something else they might find interesting... people aren't looking at timmy reynolds cd's on amazon.com because they think he's a mediocre talent.... the other songs on the cd are kind of weird, not very listenable."
4,Not a bad book at all,"I picked this book up at a time in my life when I was very much into self-discovery. It's an easy read. I used it as a reference book after I'd read through it once, and have also given it as a gift to a couple friends. True, some of the suggestions aren't exactly suited to the typical busy lifestyle most people lead these days, but most of them can be adapted. The whole idea is to make quiet time in which you can get to know yourself better. If you're not prepared to do that, than I'm not sure why you'd even bother to pick this book up. As with everything, you get out of it what you put in. If you're willing to read and listen to the advice given here, and truly are into working towards a goal of getting to know yourself, than by all means, give this book a read."
1,A magazine,"This book has a picture on each page. It is more like a magazine article than a book. It has a lot of buddhist philosophies. I think that it sucks but I had to read it because it was 20 bucks.Yeah, I learned stuff from it, a little. But no book can fulfill you. I was looking for ways to get to know yourself, their excercises are unattainable and unrealistic for busy people. Please do yourself a favor and don't read this stupid book."
5,Bobby Bare - truly the heart of country,"Bobby Bare is a very talented man. His love for music is evident in the songs he sings and the way he sings them. I grew up listening to him and also listening to my own father perform his songs. There is nothing more enjoyable than listening to a singer who truly enjoys the music they are performing. He is the heart of country music and there is no one who can hold a candle to this man. His passion for music is personified, if you will, not only in this album, but all of his albums. Don't miss a chance to see him perform live. He is the greatest."
5,THIS IS THE BEST CD I'VE HEARD IN YEARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this CD THREE months ago, an I still haven't removed it from my CD player."
5,Great music!!,"Excelente trabajo musical. Magistral combinacion de la plena puertorrique√±a con otros elementos musicales como la bomba, la salsa y jazz. La influencia jazzistica se hace mas evidente en los arreglos de la seccion de vientos. Una joya entre las nuevas agrupaciones de plena."
1,"sprinkler does the job, but breaks easily","We purchased this sprinkler and were very happy with its performance-easy to operate and change the height. However, after just a few weeks, the base of the aluminum tube began to bend and finally cracked in half, rendering the sprinkler useless. The tube should have been made of much sturdier aluminum, or even of plastic pipe."
1,Don't buy it!,This sprinkler is a great design - but very poorly made. All plastic and thin aluminum. The plastic attachment for connecting on the hose broke after 4 uses. Spend a little more and get a good quality one.
4,Simple yet effective.,I noted several people had problems with this little lite weight sprinkler but I have used mine often and liked it so much I ordered two more. I like that it covers a LOT of area with not having to turn the faucet on much. Lite weight and you can change the height. I did buy another one very similar but heavier and more expensive. It works well too but this is much cheaper.
2,FALLS APART QUICKLY,"My daughter got this toy for Christmas. The first time she used it, one pom-pom fell apart (the handle broke off). The second time she used it, the other pom-pom fell apart (handle again). My daughter takes very good care of her toys, so there is no reason why this should have fallen apart so quickly. Don't waste your money."
4,Wheeling and Dealing,I thought the book to be very beneficial for a person just wandering what it is all about this book was not a ah lets go out and write a book and comsume some drugs along the way this was a study in the sociology of these people.
1,reads like a text book,"Not a story, reads like a school book, with the author backing up her research with ""shout-outs"", such as (Blake 1967). Boring read, pass this up. Read ""snow blind"" by robert sabbag, best book ever on the subject."
3,A few good songs,"Melba Moore is one of the greatest singers of our time with deep gospel roots. Unfortunately, on this new album, she can show her talent only on a few songs -O holy night, Go tell it on the mountain, Silent night-. The other songs are short and not very memorable, and there is also some inevitable hip-hop sounds..."
2,CI Humor,"I would equate this book to the seriousness of the tv series '24'. I read it and the first two as a means of entertainment. This is the first time I have publicly spoken out about my attachment to books of this nature ;)I would read more, but really Dave, bring it back down to earth, your first book was MUCH better."
2,"Not Counterintelligence, but an OK Read","After a reasonably good start with CI: Team Red, this one was a disappointment. Yes, it's an OK read, but there's nothing about it that is counterintelligence, or even intelligence. Nice touch of including Jim Chee from the Tony Hillerman novels. But otherwise, it was just another pseudo James Bond style, with some law enforcement and a little Stargate: SG1 thrown in. Doesn't rate the ""CI"" title."
4,Virgin Dublin,Maps and reviews were terrific. Font is small and could have used some feedback about the bad train service in Ireland.
5,Amazing,"Rich in culture, soothing, and downright contemplative in its own right. ""Scottish Moors"" is a CD that is perfect for playing in the baby's room on a bright morning, the living room on a rainy afternoon, the bedroom a relaxing night, or while on a mid-day adventure. Put it on your IPOD or other mp3 device for an exploration into the past wherever you may travel...enjoy!"
4,Certainly worthy reading material,Good reading material particularly for serious graphic designers interested in expanding the role of graphic design in today's market place. Heller's accesible prose works for me again
5,best follet book ever,"though thick and centering around the building of a church.....its wonderfully long and down right intriguing. actually it centers upon generations of a family (love those sagas) and their surroundings (slightly historical but with all the raunchy gossip) love, hate, betrayal, family...this was a great book. this is the first follett book i ever read and still to this day the best."
1,Horrid and morbid.,"I got to about half-way when I had to give up. The rape scenes are too horrible, the murder scenes are horrible. So explicit and not necessary. Since when did authors go from ""having his way with her"" to these horrible, vivid images of 17 year old girls being beaten and raped and think it's better writing? I am desparate for a good historical novel that I can read and not want to vomit afterward but this is not it. If you are the least bit squeamish about all the most horrid things life has to offer don't read this book because it serves them to you on a platter wiht all the trimmings. Horrible."
2,Over-hyped and too long...,"When my book club chose ""The Pillars of The Earth"" I was looking forward to reading this well-reviewed book. Unfortunately, this book is sloppily written and often redundant. The story might be a good one, but it continually gets lost in the minutia. Some characters are well-developed, while others border on being over-developed, and it could use a good editing to bring the wordiness under control."
4,"""Fantastic????""","Never read a Follett book... but found this on the Costco bargain table and thought ""why not??"" I love English Medieval History..I will buy the audio version, because I love to be pampered.. and I tend to speed read paragraphs to get to the ""meat"" of the book.But I got a chuckle out of one statement about the last 1/8 of the book..Elizabeth, wife of William(a real stinker) makes this one worded statement when she sees the Cathedral in Kingsbridge..""FANTASTIC"". I don't think so Mr. Follett..I do NOT believe that ""Fantastic"" is a medieval word... but well done."
1,commercial,"An extremely commercial piece of pop putting-words-on-paper. I'm sure Ken Follet is laughing all the way to the bank. Don't be misled by the categorization of ""historical"" fiction."
2,ICK!,"This novel, to me, mimicked a cheap paperback you can pick up at your nearest gas station. The fast pace of the book was nice but overall the writing was poor. Very little literary merit. The overall story is fine though."
5,Extremely Good!,i dont know why this book is getting negative reviews. This book will keep you flipping the pages and not wanting to stop reading. It is good from the first word to the last. There is not one boring part is this entire novel unlike other books of this length.
5,Wonderful,"I started reading Ken Follett when I was in High school, which I had to for a project. I fell in love with the book - Flight over water. And I started reading more of his books. I got this one way before it was on Oprah's book club, and I loved it! He is such a great writer. I enjoy his eariler stuff, and more historical stuff. I read all his newer books (family gifts once they knew I liked him). But I have a love for this one! I sent it on to other members of the family to read, and my old copy is read well! I'm looking forward to the time to read it again!"
4,"Excellent Book, a Must Read","It took me 2 weeks to read it, but it was a great book. Highly recommended!"
5,Best Book Ever,This is one of my favorite books. I am an ecclectic reader and i truly found this book both mesmerizing and challenging.
4,Must read!,"This is my first Ken Follet book. It will not be the last. I was worried about the length of the book, however it was a quick read. Very enjoyable, great characters."
1,Ugh!,"I've never reviewed a book before, but I felt compelled to have my say about this one. I read a lot, and love some books, like some books but rarely do I really Hate a book. This is the one! I usually donate books after I read them to the library but this one I threw in the trash (recyclable of course). Imagine my disbelief when I heard there was a sequel! This book was the most over-the-top, excruciatingly boring, unbelievable book I've ever read. I knew I was in trouble when Tom's wife dies in childbirth and within hours he's having sex with a stranger with whom he's professing undying love. You all know the plot so I won't go on with it, but really it was bad. I couldn't even finish it. And I loved Eye of the Needle & On Wings of Eagles, what happened Ken Follet?"
1,Not even worthy of tv drama,"I couldn't believe how uncreative this story was. After hearing gushing praise from you know who I expected something better...much better. I found this story boring and predictable. I'm offended when an author can't create drama in a female story line other than repeatedly raping her. It doesn't pass as depth, drama or creative...and it doesn't get a free pass from this reader. Don't bother waiting for it to get better."
2,Didn't see the dedication to William Golding ..,"The central plot of The Pillars of Earth is eerily similar to William Golding's riveting 1964 novel ""The Spire"" - fittingly described by an Amazon reviewer as ""One of the finest novels in the English canon"". I recommend you go with the original."
1,"Boring, cliched, repetitive","This book was terrible! What is the matter with all these people who think it's so great? I almost quit reading it a couple times because the plot was so tedious and repetitive and when I did finish, I felt like I'd wasted a big chunk of time on a massive piece of fluff!"
1,an epic disappointment,"Several people had told me that this was one of the best and most fascinating novels that they had read, so I decided to give it a try and I was severely disappointed. Both the characters and plot were underdeveloped. The one positive aspect of the book was the description of the architecture. It was the one thing the author got right."
2,Starts off well and just goes down hill,The writing and storyline started out very strong but continued to go down hill as the novel progressed. It seemed as though the author lost interest in his own story and was just trying to meet his deadline. Very disappointed.
3,Pretty interesting,Pretty good book for the most part. I just didn't see the necessity of such vulgar language and references to sex. That ruined it for me.
1,Puh-leeze,"Oh my God, will this book never end? Starting with Follet's masturbatory explanation, in the Preface, of how and why he wrote this book (do we really care about this? ""...it is my best book, and you honored it"".... yuk) to the last sentence on page 973 (yes,that's nine HUNDRED and seventy-three pages) this is, at best, a trashy romance novel. If you really want to know about the historical significance of these events, read architectural history and books about the middle ages. This is worthless, unless you like lots of rape scenes and Harlequin romance-type sex."
1,Don't waste your time.,"This book is a prolonged mess of words. There are too many undeveloped characters, a meandering plot, and an inappropriate amount of lewd content. Let's just say that the book could've been very enjoyable if it was 10-15 pages long--it didn't require a 1000. I know I'm in the minority in the rating of this novel, but it has no literary merit and was a complete and utter waste of my time. I continued reading it just to get it over with...."
1,BORING,This is a long winded boring soap opera. Don't waste your time. If you like historical novels read THE RELIGION by Tim wilcox.
5,A long long time ago in a world of trouble and dispare hope wins again.,"I first read this book many years ago, and have to say I missed the quality of this type of story until World came out.Great story and well worth the time to read the 1k pages. Can't go wrong with this choice."
4,HUGE book,"Gave it as a Christmas gift, don't know if it's any good or not. This book is extra long by the looks of the thing."
4,Epic.. and fun,"The scope of this novel is vast, and Follett obviously wanted a vehicle to talk about cathedral building, which he does with great passion. I found the smaller details he included to be more interesting, however. Follett touches upon medieval economics, storytelling, monastic structure, and warfare--and does so with the easy of an expert. I thought Follett's treatment of women of the period to be very sympathetic, although I agree with a previous reviewer that the ""breast obsession"" became tedious. Otherwise, this is a very engaging look at life in the medieval period, and I highly recommend it."
3,Long,"I found this book very long, and I thought that it spent a large amount of time giving details to things that really didn't need to be all that detailed. It seemed to give more information on how the cathedral was built than it did toward the character's details.This book came highly recommended to me, so I know that many out there absolutely love it. I, however, didn't think it was all that."
3,It's OK,"It's like the story of Job....how does Tom the Builder keep going? The story is painful and while rich with historical perspective it failed to grip me like it has so many others (friends and other reviewers). It's not a bad book in any way, but I found it boring and had to force myself to finish."
3,So long...,"I was very excited to read this because several family members had raved about it. Eh, I pushed through it because I don't like to not finish books, but it literally took me 4 months because I would fall asleep every time I tried to read. Also if you've seen the mini series and are expecting the same drama and action from the book- don't Starz took quite a bit of liberty with the story line leaving out some of the most important, beautiful details and adding some that never happened."
4,Length of book a bit daunting but a compelling historical novel,I've been wanting to read this for some time now but the length of it is rather daunting. This is a complex and engaging historical novel which spans 50 years or so in medieval 12th century Europe. What an undertaking for Follett! I'm not knowledgeable enough to know if it was historically accurate but I really did enjoy learning more about that time period particularly the glimpses into the hardships of daily life in that time period. The struggle for power for both royalty and Catholic Church was interesting too. I could have done without some of the graphic brutality. Overall I think it was a good book and would recommend it.
2,"good history, bad plot","I can't see what all the hype is about this book. I thought it was only a so-so book. I loved the Michener-esque style of telling history through a fictional story line. But the plot in this book was so bad. The entire book felt like it was an ""I got you last"" contest of one-upmanship. In one chapter the villain does something horrible to the hero, next chapter the hero gets even, next chapter villain gets back at the hero, and back and forth, and back and forth. It was really irritating to read. I plowed my way through the whole book, but I don't recommend this book to my friends. If you are interested in this type of history/fiction read James Michener or Edward Rutherford instead."
1,Take My Copy,"Let us put aside the historical inaccuracies, the one dimensional, unrealistic characters, the stunted plot, the glaring omission of any sort of depth involving anything touched upon by the author, and focus instead on the amateurish writing style with which the author delivers this 'tale.'To be honest, I was shocked to hear that Follett was an established, let alone successful, author. I thought that he had somehow harried the publisher into putting this novel out, and that they had complied, crying 'mercy,'so that he would shove off.What a bloated, overrated, bland book.All of that said, I'm glad that so many others found enjoyment in the refuse. Maybe Follett will introduce them to further, greater works of the time period, such as...anything else, by any other author."
4,settle in and enjoy this epic novel of historical intrigue,"I was completely enthralled by this book. The characters and setting are richly drawn and the story moves at a fast clip. I found myself looking up historical details continually, checking the story against historical record or simply getting lost looking at 12th century cathedral's. This is a true escapist book where the world within the novel truly comes alive. It reminds me of ""I Claudius"", there is nothing better than ancient gossip and intrique that peaks your intellectual curiosity. I do think it could have been 100 pages shorter though. The story starts to use similar plot statagies as in ""24"" where there is always yet another intrigue that the hero must overcome. We could have had one less horror from William and Waleran. The ending was a little to drawn out and thus was not fully satisfying. All in all though very enjoyable."
2,Expect more,"As a book, I thought this was a great read and worth the hype - 4 or 5 stars. Well done Mr Follett.However, as an ""Item"", which is what the review creation page says I am rating - an Item, I was disappointed to pay $14.27 for a digital version of a book that has been out for 22 years, only to find it riddled with spelling mistakes and typos. I fail to see how I am getting value for money for this ""Item""."
