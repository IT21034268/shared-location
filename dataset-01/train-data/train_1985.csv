3,Great Product.,This product was a gift for my nephew for Christmas. It seems to have about everything you could think of. My son wanted to test it out as soon as he saw it.
2,received broken,We received this with a broken blue handle and wheel. Our grandson was visiting from Chicago and when he opened it the wooden wheel fell off the blue handle. Since he was anxious to play with the playdoh etc. we just ignored the broken part. Since you ask now it reminded me. So I wouldn't rate it good because of the flimsy design on the wheel and holder.
3,"Cute set, not amazing","This is a cute playdough set, but we have one from Creative PlaythingsClay Center with Play-Doh(R)that we like much better. The Melissa and Doug set is much more limited as far as what he can do with the set. The actual playdough the comes with the set is in tiny amounts and it kind of sticky."
3,"Great toys, but the dough, well...","I love the toys this comes with, but the dough was sticky upon the second time using it. It was stuck to my little one's fingers and toys. It's a no go for me."
3,"nice, but a little too much $ for what you get","I bought this for my 2 yr old daughter to introduce her to playdoh. She loved it, but doesn't yet used the rollers. Its a great item, but I think its a little pricey for what you get."
3,So so product - awesome customer service,"I wasn't impressed with the quality of this product - the rollers didn't roll & the stamps were splintery. I emailed the company just to let them know that the quality wasn't up to par. Less than 2 hours later I got a response email asking me to call customer support - long story short - they are sending me a brand new working set at no charge. The customer service person I spoke with was very pleasant - my intent wasn't to get a new product, I just wanted to let them know the product wasn't what I expected from this brand. I give the Melissa & Doug company 5 stars just for great customer care. They want you & your kids to be happy and safe with their products so if you have an issue let them know. I'll try remember to post about the replacement set once I get it."
2,Not Impressed,"The pieces are very tiny. I was surprised at how small they were when it arrived. I thought about it and figured it would be good because the kids have small hands. But after trying to play with it, they are just so tiny and not really worth it. The wood and product quality is great as with most Melissa and Doug items. But for the price it wasnt worth it. Was glad i got it on a deal otherwise i would of been even more disappointed."
2,disappointing,there really isn't much you can do with this toy. The 5 stamps would have playdough stuck in them. my DD only enjoys taking the parts out and putting them back in their slots
2,Not as good as expected,"l thought these would be better quality being that they're Melissa and Doug. The little jars of playdoh are best hard to open for an adult , let alone a child. The rolling pins with designs are hard to roll and the stampers have chips and rough edges in the wood. Hoped for a better product than i received and probably wouldn't recommend or buy again."
3,"Tools are nice, but the dough sticks","My daughter loves to use the tools with her dough, but the dough that is included tends to stick in all the corners and is very difficult to get out. I had to wait until it dried to get the excess off. Otherwise this is a good product. My daughter likes to pretend cook so the rolling pins are great for her."
2,Not Impressed,"The dough was too small in quantity for each color and wasn't as malleable as Play-Doh. The tools were ok, but the rolling pin with the grooves seemed completely useless, all it did was get the dough stuck in the tiny crevices. We don't get much use from this set and I wouldn't recommend it. Just stick with the basic rolling pins and cookie cutters."
3,Sticky Doh,"The play doh is a little too sticky and the wooden parts get the clay stuck inside. Easy to clean, but would rather have bought a plastic set. 2 year old loves it though, so we're still happy we have it."
2,Seems small,I like the fact that they are made of what seems to be wood with plastic handles. I think they will be better for very young children given their small size. As I stated in another review. Time will tell as the children test this product.
2,new to play doh,"The paint came off of the stamper on the play doh and the roller cutter was too thich to cut the dough. Also, the dough that was included wasn't too firm, however, we already had other play doh, so wasn't much of an issue."
4,Son loves this set!,"My son is almost 2, and absolutely LOVES this set. Everything is just the right size for him - but the rolling pins can't really be held by the handles and rolled like real ones, they're just too small for that. I think I may be in the minority here, but I actually really like the modeling clay that came with this. It smells great! It doesn't seem to be too texturally different from Play-Doh brand, and we've had no issues with it being difficult or less malleable. However, I do think that it dries out a bit faster than Play-Doh as the storage tubs do not seem to be entirely air-tight. We've only had the set for about 2 weeks, so no issues with paint coming off. If it holds up long-term I'd be willing to give it 5 stars, but we've only had it about 2 weeks so I just don't know yet :)"
2,too cheap,"Disappointing! The molds are teeny tiny little caps to little cups of play-dough that is too hard for easy molding. The three rolling pins are the best part, sized for little hands. The block molds are both tiny, and not sharply defined enough to make good impressions. Would not recommend."
4,Play dough fun,"This product is fun for my granddaughter to play with. The case it comes in is great except it would be better if it had a lid so it could be utilized as a storage box long term.Great product, fast shipping, as advertised."
2,not even an ok purchase during the 1/2 off M&D sale.... & no way at full price!,"2 or 3 times a year Amazon puts a lot of M&D; products on sale... and so I got this for $10.The blue wheel cutter like thing (looks like a pizza wheel) was worth the $10 all buy itself. Our toddler loves it. Nothing else in the set is worth 2 cents.Play-Doh plastic roller does a much better job at flattening the dough.The stamps (square blocks) you see in the picture are the only designs you get.... which is just silly, since like a dice, there are 5 more sides to each block that M&D; could have utilized for many more patternsAnd don't even get me started on the tiny amount of playdoh that comes with this set. It's pathetic."
5,real nice,love it 2 year old grandson loves this kept him busy for a long time was able to get dinner ready while he played
4,"Standards Rule, Jazz rolls, wish it was studio","Recorded ""live"" in a warehouse setting, Carl Anderson presents the best cover of a ""Who can I turn to"" I have ever heard - Tony Bennett included. The rest of the CD has very well performed Jazz riffs, but the actual recording tecnique was not there. All in all, a favorite album, but wish it was studio. That's what happens sometimes ""live""."
4,This really works,"My 8-year-old now gets 100% on her multiplication tests. We loved it. Also, our box was missing a set of cards and the company was easy to deal with. They sent me the missing cards right away. no charge."
5,A must-have for Depeche Mode influenced musicians,"If you are a musician, play piano or guitar and want to delight your friends with songs of one of the best Depeche Mode albums ever recorded, this book is the most desirable sheet music publication you can own. It contains complete transcription of all songs of ""Ultra"" album for vocal, piano and guitar and although the price is not the lowest, you will not regret your money.And you will have very nice addition to your Depeche Mode collection."
4,This works for nother maker's vehicles?,I sent an inquiry to the seller with no reply.This product is what I have been thinking but not sure if this will work for my Chrysler Sebring 2000.Anyone has an opinion?
3,Decent game if you run as Administrator,"The game itself seems very engaging - but my kids won't be able to play it, because it will only run on an administrator account under Windows XP. (Some games will allow you to run them under a regular account and just give the program administrator privelages, but this game won't do that either.) If you let your kids run your computer as an administrator, it is a fun game, though."
1,Is Demo copy and not meant for sale. :-(,What more is there to say...$26.99 plus whatever S&H and this isn't even supposed to be for sale. :-( I sure wish we hadn't bought it and that we could return it for whole refund.
5,GUCCI Diamond G MOP Watch,"Gorgeous watch. The diamonds sparkle so beautifully. Very light-weight, which is a plus, I hate heavy clunky watches."
3,Mixed Results,"Well, I purchased 2 of these for my Dell Inspiron 5100, and one is working in there now, and the other one kept crashing my PC. Yes I did update the bios, and my PC works fine with one PNY 512MB Memory Module and one 512MB Module from another company. So I know the PNY Memory will work with the Dell, but they must have some problems with these."
1,bad memory,The product is faulty and causing blue screen to my laptop soon after I install it to my HP pavilion laptop.
3,It is working....,>Thank you for your recent purchase from Amazon.com.>We invite you to submit a review for the product you purchased or share an image >that would benefit other customers. Your input will help customers choose the best >products on Amazon.com.It is an old memory technology that I installed in an old laptop. It is working. What more is there to say?
2,Should have shopped around more,"Not more than five minutes after clicking the submit button on my purchase, I found comprable items online for a substantial amount less than what I paid for here."
2,SENT WRONG Item,i ordered what thefirst picture was. so i ordered it and i got the wrong item. it was not like it was shown in the pictere. i want a refund.
3,Good .Transaction,"Don't really know what to say about this. I got it, installed it, and it worked. Runs fine, and you gotta buy what the computer says that you need for it. The seller delivered it fast, sent a quality product, and him I can recomend highly."
5,Works as expected,Arrived in simple plastic packaging. Just a few seconds of unpacking and installation and an old Inspiron 1000 was running with 1.2G instead of 256MB. Couldn't have been easier and have had no issues.
3,it works,I doubled my current RAM with this addition. Not sure if I really see a difference in performance. Installation was easy and shipping was quick.
4,Memory improved,This product has speeded up my computer by 50%. Should have done it a long time ago.
4,worked as described,I used this memory to upgrade an old laptop for my wife. She uses it for email and surfing the web only so this made a huge difference with loading web pages and with startups. Installing it was very simple once you figure out which type of memory is compatible with the computer. Basically it's plug it in and your good to go. The outcome was as expected.
5,Works fine in Dell Inspiron 1200,The price was very reasonable so I decided to give it a try. Plugged it in and computer booted up fine recognizing correct memory size. Works fine in Dell Inspiron 1200
5,Worked perfectly and sped things up,"I was putting a fairly old laptop into service which only came with 256mb of RAM. Took out one 128 module and put this one in. I now have over 1 GB of RAM and the computer doesn't ""swap"" during casual use and is super quick."
5,Works Great............,"I purchased this memory after a lot of yes and no thinking if this will actually help speed up my laptop. It worked perfectly fine and my laptop which took almost 5+ mins. to boot up, is now up and running in less than a minute. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to upgrade their 512MB memory RAM laptops."
5,Great service!,"Pulled both SIMMs and put new ones in, and Thinkpad wouldn't come up!! Swapped in the old ones till the bad one was found. I reported, and they shipped free replacement and free return packaging the next day. What GREAT Service. Why leave home to shop?? P"
4,Helps speed an aging machine,A pair of these helped bring my Sony Vaio almost up to speed - there's only so much you can do when a laptop is 5 year old. Now I can multi-task again.
2,Laptop to freezes when streaming video,"I used this memory chip to upgrade an old Compaq laptop from 128 MB to 512 MB. It seemed to work fine, except when I tried to stream movies over Netflix. When watching a movie, the browser would crash after 1 to 15 minutes. I put the old 128 MB module back in the laptop, and it fixed the problem."
5,memory upgrade,Memory worked great for my older dell.Price was right.Shipping could have been a little quicker.
2,Only half satisfied,"Looking at the content of my order, the two packages were exactly the same but the actual memory's were different brands. (not what I expected) since I ordered two of the same brand, and I didn't recieved What I actually order. Thats My Big dissapointment. At this point I don't know if that's going to affect the performance of My computer"
3,Upgrading the RAM on your Laptop,"My 6-year old Dell Inspiron 8600 came with dual 256MB DDR memory modules and was never a screamer when it came to using the internet (dial-up or hi-speed cable). Once ordered, my (2) new PNY 1GB memory modules were delivered on schedule. In researching the upgrade options on Dell's website, I came across a video that clearly showed how to install the new memory modules. When it was time to swap out the original modules with the new PNY's it was a breeze. Once I had a small enough screw driver, it took me no more than 15 minutes - start to finish. Although I do notice improved performance, it is not nearly what I expected. I was hoping that my computer would operate just like you see on TV, with blink-of-an-eye connections. Although there is noticable improvement, I am still not operating at warp speed. I do feel the upgrade was worth the $90.00 (including tax and shipping) for both new modules."
3,RAM,PNY Is a great brand but must have recived a bad batch the ones I recived quit working about 35 days after installednot becouse of heat have an (laptop cooler) misplaced the paperwork to return so just purchased replacements at a local store
3,Do Your Homework,"Cannot vouch for how well this product works, but I can say that I used PNY's website to determine which RAM to use with my Sony VAIO PCG-K33 and PNY said these chips would work with my laptop. Unfortunately, upon installing these chips I found that my laptop is NOT compatible with these chips. So in short, do not trust PNY's site to tell you which chips are compatible with your laptop. [...] refunded everything for the chips, except retun shipping."
4,Design nonconformance,"Good memory that works great in my Acer Travelmate 800. But according to the picture the module has four memory chips (on each side), but the memory module I received has twice as many chips (eight on each side) without any PNY mark, so don't trust the picture."
1,Incompatibility with IBM ThinkPad,"I purchased this memory module to upgrade the RAM in my notebook. However, there is an apparent incompatibility between this 1GB DDR module and my IBM ThinkPad 1836-xxx notebook. I returned the first module and subsequently received a replacement (not sure if it was the original or a new module) which does not work either. The PNY website specifically lists this module as being compatible with my notebook. By the way, I have multiple 1836-xxx notebooks in my office and I tried the memory in more than one each time to no avail. It looks like a good module and is comparible cheap. Nevertheless, this module is of no use to me because it won't work in my PC."
3,A little disapointed!!,"Hi, I've recived the item on time but the problem is that the package were opened, besides the memory's brand were not the same with the package brand, the package says ""PNY"", the brand that i ordered and the memory says ""hnnix"", the memory wokrs fine but as i said i'm a little disapointed most by the opened package because looks like someone changed the memory."
5,PNY 1GB is Awesome,I bought this product for my Toshiba satellite laptop! I have one word WOW!! My laptop needed this I will be purchasing another one to put another GB in. A must have to boost your laptop.
5,It's ram. It works,"So far it's reliable. Good price, good performance. Hate the plastic bubble packaging, but that has nothing to do with the product. If you have an older laptop that needs more ram this works well."
5,Upgrade,"Installed (2) 1G and no problems, my system zips right along now and you couldn't have asked for a better price"
5,Sparkling new views of a classic world,"Berkman's stories give us a multifaceted prism--""the women he loved""--through which to view Shakespeare's works and days. In Duty, we get a glimpse of the secrets Juliet's mother must hide, giving broader dimensions to the classic love story. No Cause reminds us that the people in the Bard's sublunary life were real, with needs more immediate than the call of mere literature. My favorite story (Magic Wand) has Titania bridging these worlds with an Orlando-esque sweep through time and levels of reality (which is more real--the midsummer fairy world Shakespeare created or the world that buys Globe Theatre keychains?), portraying a muse who must be written in order to live and who must live to enable a writer to create lives. These little gems are witty and thoughtful; I look forward to a deeper novel from this young author."
5,KEY CABINET:,"This product fit my needs perfectly. It was the right size, held more than enough keys, separation of keys was excellent and the case was very sturdy. The case had a lock and key and came with plenty of key ID tags. It was easy to install. I would recommend this product."
5,Very effecient key cabinet,"Bought one several years ago for our construction office. Needed another,so bought the same thing again. Very efficient."
1,"This rake was the best, now it's useless",These guys at Union Tool really messed up. This used to be a magnificent rake but they changed the manufacturing process (probably tried to use less expensive materials) and it no longer has any use whatsoever. The tines are flabby and don't rake anything. I talked to them about it some time back and they indicated that they were taking steps to restore the old qualities but I see no evidence that they have done so. I have been buying this rake for twenty years and I use about two or three per year.
5,An Excellent Book,"I teach a distance learning course about family violence and this is the required reading for my course. The students are required to write a paper on this book, and usually their response includes that they can't believe that spousal abuse happens in the church.Christians can easily hide abuse that happens within the home. We can easily put on our ""Sunday face"" when we're around our church family, but at home, it's a different story. If you work in any ministry within the church, I would recommend that you read this book. What I like about this book is that it also has an international focus - it's not just focused on the U.S. So, even if you're a missionary in another country, this is a good read for you too. This will help you to understand the problem and cycle of spousal abuse and how you can help those in the midst of it."
1,Don't waste your money.,"This book may have been useful once upon a time, but it's definitely not anymore. Even then, the authors best advice was to move to the northeast. He does make some valid points, but nothing earth-shattering. Don't waste your money."
2,so so.,"out of date and pretty mickey mouse. If it cost a dime that is 10 cents to much. sorry, but that is my view of this book. it's more like a pamplet than a book as far as info is concerned."
4,great gift,I got this for my sister in law as a small token of my sentiment. She loves it and all have asked where she got it.
5,Cutest Bracelet Ever,"When I opened my package and saw this bracelet, I knew instantly that I had made the right decision to purchase it. I'm giving them as gifts to attendants for my winter wedding, and I couldn't be more satisfied. The picture really doesn't do it justice!"
2,Defective motor without company response,"We purchased this particular erector set to provide benefits of a motor. However, the motor was defective and neither the manufacturer or the distrubutor responded to e-mails for motor replacement. With such poor customer service, we opted to return the entire set for a full refund rather than risk getting another defective or incomplete set. Would never recommend this toy."
4,Practical Demonkeeping: A Comedy of Horrors,"Christopher Moore is a sick twisted dangerous man who should be locked up for his own safety. Locked up with a word processor. Read his books. Give them to your friends. Get new friends, buy more books."
5,"First Moore book, loved it.","This is my first book of his that I have read, and I became an instant fan. A clever story that draws you in, easy light reading that anyone should be able to enjoy. I am hooked."
3,Moore's first but not best!,"I have loved every piece of Christopher Moore's work I have read, until this. Here, in Practical Demonkeeping, you can really see how much Moore has evolved into the comedic story telling master that he is now. In this novel he needed more room to let these characters take more shape. The comedy was there but it was much more subtle as opposed to his next novel taking place in Pine Cove (Lust Lizard Of Melancholy Cove). Overall it was a good book but the author has spoiled me with his later and funnier works. This is a good place to start but not where I started!"
4,Quick enjoyable read,"This is the second Christopher Moore book I have read. The first was Lamb, which came out about ten years after this one and I think is a far better book. This is still really enjoyable though. I don't usually care for fantasy, mysterious type books, but Moore has a great sense of humour and this book moves at a real pace. My main dislike about it was that it was unnecessarily complicated. A lot of characters and a lot of details to keep track of (who has what power, over whom, how it can be removed, etc etc). I also agree with other reviewers that it was wrapped a little too quickly and easily without a big climax. Inventing hidden plotlines or last-minute secret powers is sort of an easy way out, no? But I recommend this book nonetheless. Or check out Lamb first."
3,Not so great... but better then nothing.,"I read it, cover to cover. Every word. And honestly, except for some of the content (there's a little sexual stuff in there) it could have been a book I'd have read in grade school for the writing. Very easy read. The storyline is okay, moderately interesting. A guy has a demon named Catch who goes with him everywhere. Someone else wants to banish the demon back to hell, and someone else is falling for the demon's tricks thinking she will inherit great power to make the Earth a better place.Will I read it again? Not likely. In fact its very likely I'll donate this book to Book Crossing and say good bye to it for good. Its just not that good, and how it managed to get a solid 4 star average here is beyond me."
4,creative and funny,Practical Demonkeeping was a very funny and unique book. While this book is not for everyone - I certainly laughed aloud on several occasions.I liked the characters and thought that it was great for a beach or bus/airplane read. Enjoy this book - it is a guilty pleasure.
4,What a great book!,"I just finished this book and already I can't wait to re-read it. I laughed out loud so many times I know the people @ the park thought I was crazy! I think ""Island of the Sequined Love Nun"" will be next on my list of Moore books."
4,A Riot,If you want to laugh...this book is a riot!..very imaginative fantasy tale featuring very real characters
5,"Funny, creative, and intelligent-Christopher Moore!","Practical Demonkeeping may have been the first book by Christopher Moore, but it sure is a keeper. I am now reading his lastest and if you have had a chance to pick up one of his books-DO IT NOW! Practical Demonkeeping is funny for sure, but the characters really come alive on the pages. I for one would love to see one or all of his books put on the big screen. Good story lines, excellent humor....just what this world needs now"
4,Heck of a First!,"I cannot believe this was Moore's first book! All the signature Christopher Moore hooks are here: quirky cast of characters, too funny dialogue and situations, tight plot and pacing; I can't believe he pulled it off right out of the gate. This has a pretty extensive cast to keep up with, but he pulls it off and doesn't leave any storylines hanging. I was sorry to see Catch eat some of the people he ate, and not sorry to see others get crunched down the demon's gullet, but that's how it should be, otherwise Catch would have been some sort of allegory for divine retribution, while the reality is that crazy, unexplained evil can even strike mostly harmless transvestite graveyard shift hotel clerks."
3,3.5 stars for me,"I love his work. All of it, but this one as fantastic for me as some others. I still would read it if you like Moore's work, but maybe before the Lust Lizard book. Some characters appear here that do in Lust Lizard. The same bar and bar owner and the same town. It's still witty and fun, but the story seems a little less involved and I believe it's shorter as well than some others."
3,Nice little funny book,"A silly little book with witty humor throughout. Ends up being like the mad, crazy dash to save the day like you might find in a movie. Is this amazing writing? No, but it is a fun and easy read, great for a lazy Saturday sitting by the pool. I believe Moore uses the town of Pine Cove (the book's setting) in numerous novels and many of the townsfolk make appearances across the different titles.I will probably read another of his books."
5,Amazing as Usual,"Christopher Moore again amazes me with his talented forked tongue. I have read most of his work. But decided while bored out of my mind on a deployment in Afghanistan to go back and read through all of his work. Starting from the beginning. As this being his first novel I started with it. And I was not disappointed at all. His ability to blend intelligence, humor, and great character development is beyond anything I've ever read. Bravo, bravo, I hope to one day stoop to his level of greatness."
3,I want my own Demon,"This is the third Christopher Moore book I've read in the past few weeks and while I greatly enjoyed it I keep hoping it is going to be as good as the first one I read (Dirty Job). I put this book on par with The Stupidest Angel in that it was quite funny, however, it took a good 1/3 of the way through the book to really hit its stride. Not that the beginning was boring, it just takes a bit to get going. Yes, the humor is juvenile and stupid.... but that is what makes Moore's books so much fun to read. They are a complete break from reality.What would you do if you had a man eating demon under your control and it also kept you from aging? I can think of a few people I know that would make a nice snack for the demon.Worth the read."
4,Snarky demonic fun,"This is a quirky book about a young priest-in-training who unwittingly commands a demon into existence that gives him immortality but follows him around eating folks for, well, forever unless he can find a way to send the demon back to hell. Its snarky and I enjoyed it oh-so-much! Moore has a very twisted sense of humor and I hear his books only get better after this one (and I thought this one was pretty nifty so I'm excited!)."
4,Fun and twisted read,"This book was a delight to read. It took me about 60 pages to really start getting into it and the characters. There are a lot of characters in this book and they are all well developed. Christopher Moore is great at weaving a story together from other characters points of view. His twisted sense of humor was very entertaining.If you like the sort of sci fi mystery that doesn't quiet take everything so seriously, you will love this book."
3,A good change of pace,"This isn't the typical type of book that I read, but it was a lot of fun. I have since picked up several other books by Christoper Moore. This is a great story!"
1,Lacking wit,"I found this book extremely disappointing - maybe because I was used to the wild wit of Carl Hiaasen ( if you don't know him check out his ""Stormy Weather"" )- so I expected Practical Demonkeeping and the other books by C. Moore to be hilarious : just look at their titles ! But I found the humor ""immature"" , lacking substance , the plots of his books seemed always too weak and unconvincing , ""kiddie"" humor..."
3,Moore's first book,"Travis O'Hearn arrives in Pine Cove and he's not alone. With him is a demon, Catch, that answers to him for the past 90 years. Travis has been criss-crossing the country, tracking down a way to rid himself of the demon. Meanwhile, Gian Hen Gian, King of the Djinn, also shows up and enlists the aid of Augustus Brine to eliminate said demon. Throw in a mix of off-kilter characters and you get Christopher Moore's first book, ""Practical Demonkeeping"".Maybe I'm tainted by his later works or maybe he has just improved that much but this book was just ok for me. Better thanFluke: Or, I Know Why the Winged Whale Sings (Today Show Book Club #25)but nowhere near as good asLamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal. Either way, it's a good introduction into Christopher Moore's writings, is a quick read, and you just may get a few laughs from it."
4,Jumps around a lot; a fun read,"If you remember Pulp Fiction or Playing by Heart for jumping between any of several plot lines and wondering how they relate, this story isn't quite that intense, but you get the idea. There are a lot of characters and you feel invested in all of them by the story's end... even the bad guy. This book wasn't as funny as Lamb, which is really great, but I enjoyed it nevertheless."
3,A hoot!,"So, mayhem and madness have descended upon Pine Cove, a thinly-disguised Cambria, California, which, if you've ever been there, is more than amusing in and of itself.Moore's first novel, while not as laugh-out-loud funny as his later work (LAMB, for example -- and the only one I can use for comparison at this point), is a hoot. I especially enjoyed the Djinn who curses in visible blue swirls. And at least one critic has compared Moore to Vonnegut, which may actually lead me to read that copy of SLAUGHTERHOUSE 5 that's floating about the house somewhere.Fun stuff. Recommended."
3,a convoluted tale,"""Practical Demonkeeping"" is a story of a man, his demon, and the small California town they stumble upon one afternoon.The story is certainly interesting, but it is unnecessarily convoluted. I couldn't help but think, while reading this novel, that there are enough interesting characters and subplots to make at least a second book. With some judicious editing, this would be a much better story. As it stands now, it is readable but not engrossing. As it was Moore's debut novel, I hope that his writing style is tighter in subsequent novels.This didn't put me off of reading more of Moore's novels, but it doesn't have me rushing out to buy them either."
3,Demonic!,I love Christopher Moore and have read many of his books. This was my least favorite so far but a fun read anyway.
5,You will NOT be dissappointed!,"Christopher Moore is a master at making people laugh. I read Practical Demonkeeping when it first came out in 1992, and anxiously wait for each new installment from Mr. Moore. I haven't been disappointed yet. Even though Mr. Moore seems to improve with every book, Practical Demonkeeping is still my favorite - as it was where it all started."
5,What a great book!,"I have just finished reading Practical Demonkeeping and immediatly got on line to see what else Christopher Moore had written. Wonderful story, even better characters and the style of humor had me laughing out loud quite a bit. I loved the little references to H.P. Lovecraft that popped up thru out the book.It is less than a week until christmas, I have so much to do its insane and yet I had to finish this book, and then look to see what else he had available. (There may be time to add a new book to my christmas list.)"
5,What a Great and Hilarious Story,"Travis has been twenty years old for seventy years. He's been given eternal youth by Catch, a human-eating demon and this pair have just arrived in the small Californian town of Pine Cove just south of Big Sur, which is full of neo-pagans, perverts, winos, drug dealers, deadbeats and weirdoes. Catch wants to chow down, Travis just wants his freedom.Factor in a pretty waitress, her drunk husband, a cop, a paranoid, a genie, a witch and a Zen fisherman and all hell breaks loose in a tale that will have you laughing right up to the end of the book."
4,A Good Rollick,"I've always wanted to say ""Rollick,"" but never had the guts to do so in public. I'm not even sure its a word, but...rollick rollick rollick rollick!!! Woo-hoo. I am complete.Meanwhile, if you like funny books with silly characters and light-hearted shenanigans (there, I did it again), try this one out. You won't be disappointed.Remember, laughter is good medicine too."
2,Love Christopher Moore But This One Is Not Funny,"I don't know why but this book just isn't funny. It should be, based upon the subject, and heaven knows Christopher Moore is laugh-out-loud hilarious. But it isn't. Can't recommend it. I do recommend Island of the Sequined Love Nun and Lamb, however."
4,Demons,Another original take on a monster book - good even for those with a weak stomach - he has a way of making even the gruesome & scary seem like fun
3,"Not his best, but his best is still better than most","I would give this 3.5 stars. I've only read one other Moore book, I Know Why the Winged Whale Sings, and it was loads funnier than this one, but this one had its moments. I liked the intelligent humor. He doesn't talk down to you, while making the humor and silliness accessable."
5,The best blues selection and R & B from the 30's on through,"BUY THIS ALBUM....great selection of blues from the 30's on through the 90's. BoDidley, BBKing, Carl Perkins..Honey Don't...the Killer, Bessie Smith, what can I say a cross selection of music at its best."
4,wrong part,"I received the wrong part for my truck, but the customer service from Amazon was great. Credited my account for the full purchase price."
4,Great after a little easy fix I did,At first the top was way too loose after locking. It allowed a 1/4 inch space which I could easily push a butter knife into and use it to push the locking bar over and open it. All I had to to fix it do was use my thumb to bend the lock bar up a little bit toward the top and now it locks tightly against the bottom lip.
1,Not Secure,"When in the ""locked"" position, the top can be lifted at least one-half centimeter, at which time any additional pressure will force open the box. A determined 2 year old could open this box when ""locked."" I would not recommend this item if your intent is to lock the box."
1,Defective,The one I received was missing the latch inside the box for the lock to attach to. Returning to amazon and will order another brand.
3,safe and sound,it holds every thin i needed it to. wish it was a little bigger though. still hold pass ports and such...
3,Not very accurate,"Maybe there's more variation in coin thickness than there used to be, with all the new designs, but I found it easy to be over or under by a coin or two with these. It's also very easy to confuse the penny and dime tubes, so you'll probably want to mark them.On the plus side, these tubes are inexpensive and it's fairly easy to get the counted coins into the rolls. Aside from accuracy, the negative is that you still have to sort all your coins by hand."
5,I Couldn't Put it Down!!!,"This was an awesome book. Of all the Saddle Club books I've read, this is by far my favorite. Lisa was great! She risked her own life and her horse's to save her friend. This is a really great book..."
5,Greeaatt book! interesting.,"Pretty good. I won't tell u the story, but, Lisa really takes charge! And she rides for Carole. It shows you how friends, BEST FRIENDS should be."
3,unrealistic--Bonnie's done better,"Blegh, Bonnie has done better--that's for sure. At first I thought it was good, but after Stewball and Lisa fall off a cliff, and actually land on their feet--now that's unrealistic! And Bonnie did a mistake. The Rocky Mountain fever, which is what Carole and Kate catch, is caught by a tick bite. Now, living out in the country, I have PLENTY of experience with tick bites. Lisa recalls seeing Carole and Kate itching alot. And you DO NOT itch from a tick bite. It's flea bites that you itch with.So if you like realistic books, I'd suggest a different saddle club book."
5,Lisa Has To Ride for her life,I loved this book because it had so much action. The Saddle CLub was invited to the Bar None ranch for a holiday. But when they find out that Stevie is not able to come they have to go on with out her. But when Kate gets sick and is not able to go with them to a medior shower with them they go with out her. The Carole gets the same sickness and Lisa has to find her way back to the Bar None for help. She gets caught by robers and she has to go over a cliff to find her way back. Stevie is at her hated cozins wedding but meets a boy who has two sweet horses. But when she gets back her cozien sees that she has been riding she finds out where she has been and get angrey. But she was out walking in a thunder strom and finds one of her friends horse hurt. But then she had the owner call the vet. And Lisa is able to help Carole. This is a 100 star book if i could give it that many stars.
4,Live fast and dirty?,"This is a pretty good book that tells you about how to make a movie without a lot of money. There's a lot of good nuts and bolts info. But if the thought of haggling and begging for everything doesn't strike you as very fun then you might want to look elsewhere. Also, DV film is changing so fast that there's a world of technical info that makes books like these obsolete the by the time they get published. (Props to the authors for noting this themselves)"
3,This book is NOT about Digital Filmmaking,"I bought this book together with ""Rebel Without a Crew: Or How a 23-Year-Old Filmmaker With $7,000 Became a Hollywood Player"" by Robest Rodriguez, and have to say that this book pales in comparisson to that book.I give it 3 stars for the effort and for the final chapter on movie distribution and the forms included in the appendix.I also feel RIPPED OFF because this book has NOTHING to do with digital filmmaking. They only vagelly mention digital technology. I think anyone who wants to make a quick buck can sue these guys for having such a missleading title for the book."
3,Where is the digital?,"I bought this book thinking it would help in a film project utilizing a good camera and a few volunteers. Unfortunately it does not even have much to say about the possibilities of digital filmmaking, but rather gives a disorganized (how about some editing?) depiction of their experience in making two films. I am not sure they even used the digital format.... The true focus is how to produce a film with little budget, and little experience. Not a bad topic, but not what I was expecting from the title. Three stars for the appendix, the chapter on working with the crew, and budget."
3,Digital Filmmaking 101,"Has lots of information and tips on ""how-to-"" do many things. But I wouldn't try to make a movie of it. It just didn't hit me."
3,"Its ok, wanted to learn more about dv film making","Its pretty informative but I wanted to learn more about the digital production side of film making.But I guess I should of read the table of contentsShould rename the title: "" How we made our movie and we can teach you too! (2004)"""
1,This is outdated information from an unsuccessful man,"Based on the other reviews here I can see that some people found it helpful but this book offers little to no information on digital filmmaking. The real world experience offered in this book offers you only obvious common sense tips on how one would go about making two embarrassing ""home video"" movies."
2,WHAT A WAIST OF TIME AND MONEY.....DON'T BUY THIS BOOK,"This is not the first book I read on the subject, and although I'm not an expert, I don't need to be one to realized It failed to communicate the basics on independet film production. It lacks a lot of info on contacts for production and didn't even mention or reviewed any specific product that can be used in film making, wich its what most novice people intersted in the subject are looking for. The way the book was set up didn't help much either. Most of the reference, which is minumum and simplistic, is in the back of the book instead of in the same page. That make you having to go back and forth. If you want a better book on the subject stick to the Dummies' one....you will note the difference."
1,Buyer Beware!!,"I purchased this item as a birthday gift for my nephew. While it arrived very quickly, I was very disappointed. The second hand was floating loose inside the face. Then we tested it and the alarm feature did not work. We tried several times with no luck. Also, this company does not refund shipping charges on returns and you have to pay to ship it back to them as well. They indicated the weight to be 7 pounds which is absurd. The entire package doesn't even weigh a pound!! I think they did this so they can tack on another $15.00 to ship it to you, as thought the $35.00 cost of the clock is not enough of a rip off ( a fair price would be around $20.00). I am very angry and will not be buying anything from this company again. UPDATE-after corresponding with the company they agreed to send me a replacement clock at no charge. In addition they did not make me return the broken clock. The new clock arrived promptly and worked okay."
3,Cute but very narrow,"I bought the pink and green to go with my Bebe capelettes in the same colors. My feet are a size 3 kids but wide. I wear anywhere from a 6-8 depending on the style. This shoe is very narrow and pinches even more because of the band on top of the vamp. If you are to buy this shoe, unless your feet are narrow, go 1 size up. Otherwise, it will pinch too much and you just might rip the vamp off the side screws."
3,good for the price,"For the price, these stockings are of suitable quality. I am 5'4"" with somewhat skinny legs (my thighs are about 16 inches in circumference), and these come up a little higher than I'd like, and they don't stay up very well. They still stay, but a lot of movement (like walking for long periods of time) will make them fall. They are not uncomfortable, and it does not seem as if they would squeeze anyone's thighs enough to be considered too tight (pretty stretchy at the tops), so if you want cheap stockings for Halloween or something (like me), these are a good choice."
5,Well done!,"We love all Magic Tree House books, but this book was the most exciting up to this point (reading the series in order). It had some delightfully unexpected plot twists that even had me wondering as my son read it out loud, just how Jack and Annie were going to get back this time! Of course we know they're going to be OK in the end, because we can't wait for the next adventure!One thing to keep in mind is that the books are written in sets of four that go together (1-4 is a set, 5-8, 9-12, 13-16, 17-20, etc) In each set the Jack and Annie have to find 4 things - one in each adventure. For this reason the books don't stand alone well if you are interested in following the Jack/Annie/Morgan story. If you are only interested in the topic covered, and don't plan to read the entire series, that it is OK to pick and choose, but we decided to read the series in order."
4,Cool for Kids!,"This book was awesome. I like that it was about a true story. I really liked the puppy in it. Kids should read this book! It was neat to read about the clothes they wore on the Titanic and how Jack and Annie got a present, and helped the passengers."
5,Tonight on the Titanic,You would like this book because it is very good and it makes sense. The characters were funny. The author was a good writer and a good drawer. I like when the ship hit the iceberg and it was starting to flood. The sad part was sme people were dying. The book was very good.
4,Rangler 8,"""Tonight on the Titanic"" is a great book about two kids who get transported in a magic tree house.By Mary PopeThe magic tree house transports Jack and Annie on the deck of the Titanic. While they are there, they have to find a mysterious gift so they can free a puppy. Annie had woken up in the middle of the night and hears that the wind is calling her, so she goes and wakes up Jack and says lets go. They reach the magic tree house and find a dog in a corner. Annie named the dog Teddy. It sounds cool for a dog. The dog has a cursed spell and so Jack and Annie have to get the curse broken. To do this they have to get a gift from a lost ship at sea. I think adults and kids would really like this book."
4,Possibly Age 7 or older,"I bought this for my granddaughter. She is almost 6. After I got her her mother thought it was not appropriate for someone her age, She had read some of the others at school and they gave her nightmares.. I read this one at it seemed fine to me."
2,Magic Tree House#17: Tonight on the Titanic,"I liked this book because I learning but I don't feel like I'm learning, and its actually kind of cool."
5,Kaitlyn's Review,"Have you ever wanted to learn about the Titanic?Tonight on the Titanic By: Mary Pope Osborne is a great historical fiction books for kids 5-11 years old and is for both girls and boys. Jack and Annie got whisked off to the titanic and are trying to save people before the titanic sinks. Jake Annie learned that they could save other people.Mary Pope Osborne has also written Sun Set on Saber tooth, Dolphins at Daybreak, and Dolphins and Sharks, Tornado on Tuesday, and Tigers at Twilight.By reading this book you will learn about the Titanic"
2,hoary old british PA novel,"i found purple 6 after reading level 7. the titles are catchy. purple 6 should have been another great entry in the library of cold war nuclear PA novels. no. it was dull dull dull, maybe because it's so english. there's a lot of dull talking and too little action. the doomsday scenario should be loaded with tension but it breaks no new ground."
2,I'm Trying to be Generous with Two Stars,"I guess I enjoy heavier reading in baseball books than what this book offers. It can be read in one sitting because it is easy reading and short. I have read some of these stories elsewhere and frankly I didn't find them to be terribly funny. The story told by Ted Power on missing the boating accident that claimed the lives of Steve Olin and Tim Crews and seriously injured Bob Ojeda and how it changed Power's life was the best one in the book. I guess a teen ager would find this book more interesting, but I enjoy more historical books on the game. My bookcases are filled with baseball books, but this one I will donate to my local high school library."
2,Hoyle Board Games 2005,Backgammon is my only real interest in this package. I wish that it had Mah Jongg. I have not tried other games.
1,Backgammon on 2007 Hoyle Board games cheats!!!!!,"My husband and I both agree that this game was programmed wrong. It won't take all of its moves if it means he will be open to be bumped. Not fair. Has taken some of my moves. For instance, I have a 3 and a 6. I take the 3 first and it will move 6. Also, always gets what it needs if it means he can bump you off the board. If you are nearing the end of the game and have been bumped off, you WILL NOT get your # on the roll until he has all of his moves in the final area and out of danger of you bumping him off before he can go out. Sometimes you go to bump him off and it will take yours with him. Very screwed up."
1,Hoyle Board Games,"This disc was hugely disappointing to me. I expected calssical board games such as backgammon, chess, checkers, etc. Instead it was various dungeon games and others of similar nature. I threw it away,"
3,"By the time a kid can play with it, they're bored with it","I bought this toy for my son, who demonstrated an interested in laptops at an early age, replacing its hard drive at age three and using it to hack defense systems of lesser developed countries by age four. He quickly grew bored with this toy, realizing that it would not allow him to post blogs about technology during his spare time."
4,Great Weird Horror Movie,I like really disturbing films and this is definitely one of them. The lead actress is great and she really carries the movie. Every time I thought this was one thing it became another thing and it made me really edgy. There was a lot of blood and some okay Aliens that you hardly even saw but most of this is like your not sure what's going to happen and everything is really horrible. It got talky at one part but I watched it through and the end is really great. If you like this type of film you'll really like this one.
3,3 stars,"Rent it first not worth the buy maybe if it was a $10 flick, then yeah but for $22 hell no. Wasnt a bad movie just not worth $22. Take my advice rent first."
3,Nothing Special,"Generally the first volume of a manga sets the stage for a series. It lays down the general tone, the overall plot, and the seeds to later conflict. This volume in general does so, but it's not terribly enticing. It's not a bad volume, but it's also not particularly interesting. All in all, it's a little old-fashioned for my tastes."
2,Poor liner notes,"This CD is marketed by the ""Kid Rhino"" division of Rhino Records, so maybe that's the reason why they thought that they didn't have to include any liner notes beyond the lyrics to the songs. Considering the classic and historical nature of these songs, this is unacceptable because we are left wondering who wrote the songs and when were they recorded. Some of this information is difficult or impossible to find on the web and Rhino should have done it for us. Some good songs, but no liner notes and only 35 minutes for a compilation of mostly public domain songs earns this CD a low rating."
1,horrible,"i really wanted to like this movie. the cover made it look great but really it [was bad]. i mean it had no storyline what so ever the zombies just kinda appeared out of no where. i mean one minute they arent there then the are! no explanation why they are there theyre just there. then the dialouge is awful i couldnt follow it at all. and to top it all off, it had random audio tracks from ""Night of the Living Dead"", ""Zombie"" and ""Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things!"" ignore this movie at all costs, i paid [price] for this movie and i wish i could return it for not liking it...oh well thats what eBay's for!"
5,The best small portable radio on the market,"After going through two Sony ICF-S10MK2 portables, I tried the Grundig G1000A. Both use two AA batteries, but there the similarities end. The Grundig pulls in more stations and has more powerful amplification. (Somewhat alarmingly, it picks up transmissions from small planes flying overhead.) It is well worth the extra cost."
2,Grundig G1000A,"I live about 60 miles from a large city with a dozen AM radio stations and as many FM ones.At night when I do most of my listening I need a good, selective AM radio to pull stations which can be drowned out by nearby transmitters on the same frequency. My old Grundig Traveler II still does this but is getting touchy and hard to tune...Sadly this modern ""Digital"" Grundig didn't even come close to the older analogue radio in terms of sensitivity, selectivity or sound quality. As an urban AM/FM radio it is adequate but for long range reception no good.Amazon's return policy then came to the rescue, I sent it back and upgraded to the Eton E5 - a much better receiver but no better than the old Traveler II in terms of sensitivity or selectivity... and burdened by an incredibly complicated and counter intuitive digital station memory and tuning system! Three steps forward and two steps backwards.Thank you Amazon for a painless on line purchase service!"
3,"Not bad for FM, Not good for AM, Lousy for Shortwave","I bought this radio for portable use to listen to National Public Radio stations 30 miles away. It works fine for that. AM is not nearly as good but ""works,"" and shortwave is lousy except for very strong stations. Digital tuning would have helped this radio a lot but the analog tuning is fairly good given its inherent limitations. For my limited needs I would buy it again."
3,good value for the money,"This radio is just what I was looking for. Small size with good reception. However. I thought Grundig was a German company. I turned it over and there it was. ""Made In China"". nuff said"
1,Bad choice,I was very disappointed with this product. Fine tuning is very diffcult and indoor reception is bad.
3,"Price , Size ,Performance its worth it!","Hello everyone , I'm Vince the radio man . I have been a radio buff for many many years and have a vast collection and I like to do compares . Considering the price , the size and the performance this is a very good buy . This model is an analog radio with a digital read out . However , the tuner sensativity and the sound quality is surprisingly good . Its the perfect radio for travel or to carry to work in your briefcase . I work in Mid-town Manhattan and have gotten some fairly decent reception on AM and SW during my lunch hour sitting on the park bench ( amazing).In my home studio it performs as well as the 300pe .... And its so small, what a pleasure . Little noise and interference and minimal drifting . Compare this to the Grundig 100pe and the choice is simple ...this one's the champ! Worth the $$."
2,some problems,"The AM tuner drifted considerably in the unit I received. If I tuned it to, say, 1130, in fifteen minutes it might drift to 1135. This made it inconvenient for listening to smaller stations, as it required regular retuning until it warmed up. I don't know if the FM and shortwave also drift, as I got tired of retuning and returned the unit."
1,DO NOT BUY Major Problems twice,I purchased this cash drawer within 2 weeks the key would no longer open the lock. big problem when the money is inside. The company quickly sent me another one and I returned the first defective drawer. Same problem happened with the second drawer. Figured we would just live with it as long as it closed and just not lock the drawer when we were away from it. Now The push button that opens the closed drawer does not work. Too much money to pay for something that creates more problems than it solves. DO NOT BUY!!!
2,NOT QUALITY ITEM,We bought this and 3 months later two of the clippy things that hold down money broke off. For the price it's not worth it.
1,cheep and flimzy,"The drawer is not the a quality cash drawer .. especially for the price, i would not get this one.........."
3,More trouble than it's worth.,"We bought this drawer since we travel to a lot of shows. It has been more trouble every time.The cash drawer is slightly misaligned so it never stays closed. It's always popping open if the key is not turned to lock it. This is frustrating at busy shows because I do not want to be constantly turning the key.The receipt slot eats receipts. They slip into the face plate and never make it into the drawer. Also you cannot put too many receipts in or it start to back up and you have to take the cash tray out, push the slips in and then put the tray back in.I would not buy it again but it was expensive so I'm stuck using it for now."
1,Understand the intended audience,"This video is part of a package for use in the instruction of junior ROTC or high school. It can not be effectively used without the purchase of an additional resource package. If you wanted to use this for work or corporate training, it is not possible. I wasted [a lot of money] on this video by buying based on its title, to find that I could not use it. Were I teaching junior rotc and had the resource package, I would have some use for this."
5,Terrific product!,"I have been using this fragrance-free product for decades! It was available for a long time in all Long's, Savons, etc. Now, there are competitors (with lesser quality items) that hog all the shelf space. I am SO happy that I can buy it through Amazon. It is the best lotion ever -- will not clog pores, so can be used under make-up. I definitely give it an A+ rating!"
1,Nutraderm TL Original formula,"NOT HAPPY !!!!This what ordered but they said it was no longer available and they talked me in to trying the Advanced formula and it realy SUCKS!!!,.......... GREASY"
3,"Nutraderm is non-greasy, fast-absorbing, and has a pleasant ...","Nutraderm is non-greasy, fast-absorbing, and has a pleasant scent. It was great on my dry skin, especially my hands, elbows, and feet. But I found that it didn't last all day or even a half-day. It'd have to be reapplied after each hand washing."
5,Big hit with my 3 year old grandson!,"Living an 8 hour drive away from my precious grandson, I knew I wouldn't be able to attend his third birthday party. I asked him what he'd like me to send him for his birthday. ""Train tracks!"" was his immediate answer. After I was able to glean a little more infomation from him, I hit the internet to do my usual research. This set was my final selection along with a separate purchase of the main Thomas engine. He LOVES it! My daughter told me that my grandson has spent many happy hours playing with his new train track and all the parts that go with it. I'm really looking forward to my next trip down there and to join my boy playing with this toy and possibly giving him some new ideas on ways he can use his imagination while doing so.Clearly I'm totally pleased with this wonderful item!"
3,"Nice set, but the mat is disappointing","Overall, the Down by the Docks set was a good deal (at $90 before Xmas) since it includes Cranky, a decent track with two elevated portions along with Percy and a truck among other items. The greatest disappointment was the playmat. It is plastic over fabric. The fold creases have still not come out of it and about a week after we set it up, all the corners started rolling up. The fold creases made it hard to initially keep the train track together (and of course, he's 2 1/2, so he wanted to play immediately!). The only way to make the playmat usable that we can come up with is to glue it down to piece of heavy duty cardboard or plywood. I think my husband is going to make a custom train table for the playmat, but that portion of the set definitely did not live up to expectations and was a major reason we purchased this set."
5,Great Starter Set!,"This set is fantastic, especially for the price we paid for it. I like how it has several interesting track features, special engines, and a playmat. This will provide hours of entertainment."
3,"Seems Solid, But Not What I Ordered","The product that arrived is quite different than what is pictured, and thus will be going back.I quite like the pictured item, but what actually arrived was a larger, black and white model that has large, white RAM lettering underneath a white Ram logo, all on a rectangular black background. The product seems solid enough but, in my opinion, is not nearly as attractive as the shiny one pictured. Since I bought it mostly to dress up the hitch receiver when I don't have the hitch installed, it kind of defeats the purpose."
4,Dodge Hitch Cover with Curtis Hitch,"The hitch cover is very good quality, only downside that I see is that it's not a tight fit on the hitch receiver leaving a gap between the hitch receiver and cover."
1,False advertising,Received my hitch cover only to find out it was black with white instead of what the picture shows. It also says RAM underneath the Dodge logo which won't work with my Durango. Seems good if you actually had a Ram though.
4,hitch cover,good fit just as advertised it was also easy to assemble it was priced about what I thought it is Worth so a good value.
3,Just Okay,"I did read a few things in this book that were new to me. However, it was repetitive of many of the Elvis books I read.I also found it to repeat many things Priscilla wrote. It was almost line per line on the movie ""Elvis & Me"" that Priscillaproduced.After reading many Elvis books, I don't believe Priscilla's position. She always makes herself look good and Elvisthe bad guy. There are many books out there written about Elvis that take a different position.Comparing it to other books, I would say it is ""just okay."""
1,Must be perfectly sized,Not a good buy if you don't fit into it perfectly. Wrinkles from shipping would NOT come out. Not surprised...shouldn't have expected high-quality for that price.
3,Some Fresh Interpretations,"This book worth the read. Mr. Forrest channeled in some new symbols, many of which have resonated deeply with me. After each degree definition, he provides a variety of well-known, world figures (Writers, Actors, Politicians, Religious Leaders) and the placement (Sun, Moon, Ascendant, etc)of the degree. If you want more detailed information, check out Lynda Hill's latest masterpiece ""360 Degrees of Wisdom"" or Lyn Birkbeck's ""The Astrological Oracle."" The first book on these symbols ""The Sabian Symbols in Astrology"" by Dr. Marc Edmund Jones and Elsie Wheeler is also another Sabian Symbols book to check out if you're into this kind of astrological symbolism."
3,decent product,"Was turned onto this product by a suggestion on another website. All comments on this product that I have read were great so I decided to try it, why not, very reasonably priced! The smell was a bit old school hair products,but laid the hair down ok, haven't experienced any gross build up yet either."
2,Kinda stinks,I gave it two stars because it stinks. It smells like the old school pomades. I will be buying Keracare's creme press next time. You don't need a lot of this either a small amount goes a long way.
1,this sucks,all you get in the box is the speaker no instructions on how to hook up and adjustit worked for a bought 3 months then stopped working don't waste your money on this the manufacturer was no help
4,Onkyo TX-8522 100 Watt Stereo Receiver,I am pleased with this receiver and would say it is a good bargain for the price.
1,They Just Don't Make Them To Last Anymore!,The Onkyo TX-8522 receiver lasted less than one month. I purchased it to replace a Fisher receiver I have had for 36+ years. Thought it was time to replace it. While listening to one of my favorite jazz tunes this new Onkyo receiver sparked - followed by the smell of a burning resistor. Needless to say I put my 36+ year old Fisher receiver back in service and continued listening to my favorite jazz tunes. They just don't make them like they use to. More to follow pending the results of the repair.
1,I sent it back,"I wanted to replace a 35 year old Marantz 1060 amplifier that had started blowing fuses. I got this thing and set it up and played a record and it sounded like Clapton was singing down inside a big can with a clothespin clamped to his nose. I was stunned. I could get Eric to sing really loud, but he couldn't take off the clothespin or get too far up out of the can. I found a local guy who diagnosed and fixed my Marantz for less than $80. I gave it one star because you can plug it in and turn it on."
2,Very disappointed,I am very disappointed with this product. I ordered this receiver after reading high rated reviews. I am replacing a 25 year old Harmon Kardon amplifier that finally fizzled. The sound quality of this receiver is so poor that it is unbeleivable. I have purchased low price radios at Walmart that sound better.There is no midrange and the bass is weak at best. I also have a worn out 25 year old Sherwood amp that I have compared it to so I know that it is not my speakers. This unit just does not have it. I also purchased the Onkyo 390 Cd player and found it to be less than wowing. This will be my last Onkyo purhase.
5,"""Try it, you'll buy it!""","This is a really nice receiver. A feature I like is that it is XM Radio ready. I bought the hook up package online for under $60 shipped, subscribed online and am enjoying the songs of the 50s and Old Time Radio. Those, and over 170 other stations for only $12.95/mo. ""Such a deal!"" I don't think you can find a nicer receiver for the price."
1,All tangled Up,"I purchased this brush last year. I only used it once, and never plan on using it again. Perhaps I received a defective brush, but the balls on the ball-tip kept getting caught on my daughter's hair, instead of smoothly moving through her locks. SO, after one use, I put this brush away and chalked it up as a loss. I own other Denman brushes and can't say enough accolades for them, but this one, I could do without."
1,The truth,"Worst brush ever..my dollar store brush is better than this brush. Dont waste ur money. Think I'm going to use it to kill flies, at least I'll get my money's worth."
1,Horrible,"This is the most dumbest comb ever. It was way too expensive for what I bought it for. It's completely false advertising and I would never, buy from them again. Excuse me for any messed up vocab or punctuations. and takes too much effort to return it"
4,Great brush but overhyped,"This brush is great, I got it after seeing it on multiple hair blogs but in all honesty I think the hype is unjustified.This brush doesn't pull or rip hair nearly as much as the average brush. The bristles are a good distance apart and penetrate between hair to the scalp nicely making for a decent scalp massage when brushing. The air in the brush pushes out every time you brush so it makes a whistle/wheezy sound which can be slightly annoying.Overall I'm happy I have it but would I recommend it? Meh, a 3$ brush will do just fine."
4,About right for it's price,"It's a decent brush; light, inexpensive at around $10, and passes the gentle test (drag the bristles along your forearm; if it leaves scratches it's too rough for your hair). However I can't speak to its overall quality or longevity as I just received it. Someone said they had theirs 9 years but I don't know if the quality has stayed the same & if the brush you get now is the same brush they made a decade ago. All I know is that it emitted a strong plastic odor after it was removed from its wrapping and it feels really cheap. I wonder how it shall hold up against heat styling. My Conair brush feels much better in terms of materials quality though it isn't this gentle. It's surprising how hard it can be to find a really good paddle brush."
3,Not great,"Thought I'd save a few bucks I over the Paul Mitchell paddle brush I was replacing, but this is probably a good case of you get what you pay for. This one is light plastic and the little balls on the bristle tips are much smaller and make the brush far less comfortable than the PM equivalent. It's not so bad that I'll return the product, but I'll be using it years from now cursing my decision to chintz out on a daily use item."
5,Best Brush for straight hair!,"I originally bought this brush in 1999 and just now decided to replace it - with the same exact one. I've tried replacing it with others, but just couldn't find one that could compare. It's very light weight and durable. Can't explain why it's so great, but it creates a pin-straight, shiny look every time. I can't live without it."
5,Best brush ever,I have this brush and absolutely love it. My 10 year old son loves it too so I ordered him the smaller (D84) version. It is well worth spending the extra few dollars for this brush.
1,Lem's dud,"If you have never read a book by Lem, you shouldn't start here. The best thing about Stanislaw Lem's stories is that he will bring up some of the most absurd angles of how our lives can be altered by technology. His best writing contains science fiction, philosophy, interesting asides and ethics wrapped up in a fun story. This book doesn't have any of that. Pick up His Master's Voice or Fiasco instead."
1,junk,"I bought this for my son. He has had it for one week, and the combination lock just broke. We can't open the cash drawer to get his money out. Once we figure out how to open it and retrieve his money, I will be returning it."
1,Like watching a very bad late night movie,"I only got to page 20, even though I was stuck on the bus with nothing to read. Embarrassing, trite, silly, with every bad-movie cliche as dialogue. It opens with a mock end-of-the-world scenario in a war room that just sounds goofy. Cut to the fictitious country of ""Bonterre"" (a fictitious country in a spy novel? Are you kidding?) standing in for Vietnam. In the field, a colonel lectures that ""guerrillas are cowards"", then they're ambushed, he panics and has to be slapped by a sergeant and thanks him for it, while the guy with the mangled leg cracks jokes. Cut to W.A.R., where the hero looks at Q-like gadgets that sound stupid, and makes comments like, ""Unless my eyes deceive me, that's a Russian T-34 tank."" I quit there."
5,Great Book!,"The content of this book is like none other I have found thus far. I appreciate the depth and breadth of the work done to research ancient information on crystal bowls as well as the intuitive approach from the author. I purchased one for a client as well, and she is very pleased. Both of us are utilizing sound for healing and are very pleased to have found this information. There are many books about sound, color and vibrational healing. They are very good, however, this book carries within a variety of information that I haven't yet found in others. The book was in great shape.I appreciate it being available.Thank you."
1,Save your cash,"I can only imagine that a thorough scouting of dog pounds was done prior to casting this movie. The feeble attempt at a plot was probably writen on a napkin during a coffee break. If you want good looking women look somewhere else, you want a story again look someplace else. If you have an urge to spend money, spend it on something else, anything else, even a 1 star rating is at best very generous."
3,Not worth your money,You can basicly read the title.I't has its fun moments and female nudity but it's not worth 20$.
2,slave girls on auction block 1313,slave girls on auction block 1313 isvery poorly made and no real storyline save your money and buy a better dvd
2,My least favorite of Moore's.,"After having read Moore's other works, this has got to be my least favorite. While I was literally laughing out loud while reading the others, while reading ISLN I kept thinking to myself, ""Okay, when does it get funny?"" The plot was predictable, and the humor seemed forced, like Moore was trying too hard. Characters weren't as fleshed out as in the other novels.If you want a great Moore book, try Lamb, Stupidest Angel, or A Dirty Job instead."
4,Moore at his best,"This truly is Moore's best work to date. I have read many of Moore's works, but this one is by far the most clear, comprehensive, and understandable book, It also is an incredibly fast and leisurely read. I laughed all the way to the end with this book as it had jokes in all the right and perfect proportions. If you are not familiar with Moore's work, this definitely is the best way to start."
4,Moore is always a refreshingly original read,"""`Boy, I'm glad all that supernatural stuff is over,' the bat said.""Our hero is Tucker Case, a dork in the body of a cool guy, who--after crashing the plane of a make-up CEO--is hired as a pilot for a mysterious Ozzie and Harriet missionary couple that double as a sorcerer and Sky Priestess for the local Shark People on a Caribbean island. Haunted by a dude in a gray jumpsuit that speaks in 1940s slang and accompanied by a transvestite navigator with a talking fruit bat, Tucker starts to unravel the mystery of the ""cargo cult"" and possibly obtain some sort of redemption. Fantastic, outrageous, clever, hilarious, and full of intriguing twists and turns; Christopher Moore is always refreshingly original. Grade: A-"
4,Love This Nun,"How do you describe a book that features a pink plane, a talking fruitbat, Shark People, a hurricane, missionaries (albeit not your average missionaries), a dead bomber pilot and Tucker Case? Hilarious.If you need a laugh this is your book."
2,Moore's Least,"This was my least favorite of the Christopher Moore novels. In keeping with his ""Tom Robbins meets the X-Files"" style, this novel is centered on an organ-harvesting scheme in the South Pacific. However, I found that it lacked the sense of slack fun the permeated his other novels. Rather than chuckling to myself, page by page, I was merely smirking.I would recommend any Christopher Moore novel, but if there is another one you haven't read yet, go to it first."
4,Worth reading.,"Loved Lamb. This is my second Moore book. Though I didn't find it nearly as funny as Lamb, I certainly enjoyed it and would recommend it. It's a great story with great characters and takes place in a fascinating and unique setting. I also feel like I learned a lot and will share many of the facts with others, whether they are true or not.I will definitely read more Moore."
4,Truth is stranger than fiction...,"A host of exotic characters come together on an isolated island where the natives are worshipping the ""love nun."" Will keep you entertained. Typical Moore, for those who have read him, but in this novel the underlying premise to all this craziness really exists! It could actually be going on! Read it and find out."
2,Not Lamb,"""Lamb"" was my first Moore exposure. And what a treat. ""...Love Nun"" is no Lamb and as the saying goes, once bitten, twice shy. This is not what I'm looking for to occupy my reading time."
3,An amusing diversion from reality,"Honestly, I bought this book on the strength of it's title...yes yes, I know, don't judge a book by it's cover...but I did. I thought from the reviews that it would be more than a detective/unwitting hero story. It was an interesting concept, a religion based on a WWII pilot, but I found myself disinterested in the main character and even less interested in the plot when it started to unravel into several stories. If you need an afternoon to shut the brain off and take a little ride to an exotic locale (Moore describes the island and it's people so well you want to hitch a canoe ride over for a little vacation) then this is the book for you."
3,Lacks Depth,"After reading Moore's Lamb, I was struck by his ability to be hilarious and completely irreverant while at the same time providing something of depth (Lamb had some interesting insights into similarity of major religions).This is the story of an alcoholic pilot recruited by the love nun and her doctor cohort. He discovers that they are contolling an entire island population for their own nefarious designs and comes to the rescue of the backward islanders.The Love Nun has hilarity and off-beat humor but not much else. The plot in and of itself was so goofy as to aid the unfortunately shallow humor. This book is good for laughs, but not much else."
5,YUM!,"If I were forced to pick my favorite Christopher Moore novels lest I suffer the pain of death, I would have to pick Island of the Sequined Love Nun as being very near the top (Lamb being my favorite one).Always witty, never dull, Moore has delivered a hit here in Island. Tucker Case, a ""geek trapped in a cool guy's body"" is forced to accept employment as a pilot (for otherwise failing to perfrom satsifactorily at his prior job) under somewhat dubious circumstances on a desolate Pacific island. Along the way, we are introduced to Kimi, the cross-dressing navigator, Roberto, the talking fruit bat, scores of Ninjas, reformed Cannibals (mostly), and a love goddess and her husband. Based upon this description, how can you fail to see the humor that ensues??In any event, don't waste time reading this review, go out and get this book and prepare to laugh!"
4,"good, not great","not his best book , but still ok. its funny and exciting enough for non christopher moore fans (or fans in the making)"
3,"This book was, in a word, frothy","Quirky and delighted with itself, this seems to be a ""typical"" Christopher Moore book, which makes me think the genius and weight of Lamb was an exception to his normal style. This book was, in a word, frothy.For more reviews, please visit my blog, CozyLittleBookJournal."
5,fun and a little whacky,"You must read this book to see what is happening with the Shark People, the Sky Priestess, and Mr. Tucker Case. Hilarious book, I almost peed my pants within the first 10 pages."
5,We should all be so lucky!,"Once again I have finished a crazy, twisted, tale of one man's adventure. Wow, what a treat that was. Mr. Moore thank you for being so wacky and hilarious. My new short term goal in life is to soak up every book you've ever written! Two down, with a third already in hand. Keep writing them and you know your fans will always be there to tag along in another crazy ride! And for anyone who can read so much as a sentence do yourself a favor and read this guys books, they are that good."
3,for cargo cult researchers and cannibals,"If you compute the arithmetic mean of Christopher Moore's work, you will arrive at this book. (I mean that in the best possible way.) The cargo cult aspect of it is what makes this novel memorable and I like to compare it as the complete opposite take on that phenomenon (i.e., cargo cults) as Gibson's approach in ""Hinterlands"".Anyway: good beach read. Or for on the plane. (Well, maybe not the plane.)"
5,This guy is something,"I'm a newcomer to C.Moore..1st was ""Bloodsuckig Fiends""..then ""Practical Demon-keeping""..now this! I still don't know how this guy does it!?I loved the other two books,but when i got the outline of a pilot,Filipino transvestites,Shark tribes,and god knew what else,..I have to say,I was less than excited...well,I read it anyway..and this by far is Mr. Moore's best..how can a guy have ghosts and talking fruitbat's in the plot and make it work? Christopher Moore does in spades!...Look you gotta read this...you will love it..it's wierd,it's different,but it's the most entertaining book you will have read in a long time...""nuff said"
4,A totally quirky and original page turner,"I really enjoyed reading this book. I bought it from the rack on the strength of the title alone (I was in a strange mood!), and I didn't put it down until I had finished it. Great characters, smooth action flow, and unexpected plot twists made this book an easy read. I love to stumble upon a new author with a really offbeat sense if humor, and I plan to read all that Mr. Moore has to offer (and then some)"
2,I LOVE Christopher Moore...,but i hated the book. It started out ok but then it just got BORING. I've read every other C.Moore book but i just can't get on board with this one.
3,Slow at first but picks up towards the end,"This isn't one of my favorite Christopher Moore books. It starts off really slow and a bit confusing at first. I spent the first half of the book trying to fit the pieces together and going back to reread some things to make more sense out of them. After the first half of the book thoughm it picks up pace and becomes more interesting. Don't let this be the first of his books you read as it might turn you off of his books. I'd start off with Lamb, or You Suck."
3,This is what I thought the author could do,"I have slammed two of the author's previous books (only bought the first, my wife got me two without finding out what I thought of the first one). This is what I thought I was getting when I bought the first one. It is a light, amusing read with interesting characters. I am a hard grader so three means worth reading. It is indeed wacky; a much overused and abused term used on books covers far too often. A book that is fun to read and is built around Pacific cargo cults has potential from the start. But so did the other two I read and they didn't come through. This one does."
4,love nuns were never so inviting,"Time and time again, Christopher Moore proves himself to be one of the most comical and unique writer's in the modern age. Complete with cannibals and quirky lovables, the plot carries some offbeat the road twists and turns, but it's a great ride. Moore's style is fresh, inviting, unexpected and flatout, a good read. I recommend it.Jeff Davis, author of Snaggler's Paradise"
4,Hilarious,"Definitely not what you're expecting, but then with a title like this, who knows what you were expecting! Absolutely hilarious and a quick read!!"
4,perfect nonsense,you have to love Christopher Moore..this is the perfect book for a rainy midwest day..keeps you laughfing and entertained throughout.
5,So Relaxed it punches you in the gut and you say thanks,"There is such a happy, lighthearted tone to this book that you forget that you are reading about a planet of killcrazy artificial intelligences who wage war for the hell of it and murder each other for convenience sake. This was one of my first books read in the Doctor Who series and I was hooked with it. It's great to see that the novelisations have continued the great traditions of Doctor Who"
1,Not Recommended,"I was very excited to read a book that had such high reviews. Unfortunately, I was very dissappointed. I read to about page 70 and just couldn't keep going. The plot was going nowhere, the story dragged and bored me. The Doctor is absent from most pages, and his new companions bored me to tears. This Dyson Sphere planet is a clever idea--almost too clever. The setting, the super-advanced world is dull and empty. In addition, the names of the natives are full of capital letters for some reason. What's more, there are exclamation points in the middle of their names. I found the names annoying, and the book tedious. I tried to finish it, but I couldn't waste my time.Instead, I would highly recommend The Festival of Death--a terrific Fourth Doctor story by Jonathan Morris."
2,Didn't like the taste,"I ordered this steak rub after discovering it while searching for a steak seasoning. I have many different steak seasonings, but am always searching for a better one. This one had a burned taste that neither my wife, nor I liked. I threw it away after trying it."
2,Disappointed in flavor,"Applied Char-Crust per manufacturers suggestion.Did crust and seal juices,but added little to no Hickory flavor to the burgers.Would not purchase product again."
3,not what I thought,I was looking for the liquid treatment that gets added to pond water adn thought that this was the stuff. It even said 1-quart spring and Summer. But when I got it I found that it was little packets of material to be added to the pond. I get the impression that this is something else entirely. I have used it and suppose that it is ok but It is not what I expected.
4,Missmatched description,"I have used this product before with good results. I hope I get what the picture shows as a box of packets. This does not match the product description of ""1 Quart""."
5,Cray is Cookin' on High!,"This was my first Cray cd, and I have to say after to listening to only the classic first track, I was hooked. This album, although it is now over 25 years old, is startingly fresh and contemporary, in a word, timeless. His signature sounds are all here-the searing guitar, witty lyrics, and the soulful vocals. This early record, often overshadowed by Cray's more commercially successful releases, is a must-hear for any Robert Cray fan. He is surely a master chef of the blues and Cray serves a delectable dish of tunes on this one."
4,Typical key cabinet,"Our key cabinet gets daily use, 14 hours a day and it's holding up really well. The only complaint I have is the little metal clips for attaching the key to the tag aren't the best. They a bit flimsy and can get bent up. We ended up replacing them with regular key rings (found on Amazon) and that fixed the problem. Also, pay attention when mounting this to the wall. It's easy to put it on upside down if you're not paying attention, and the tags won't go in or stay on well when you do this (didn't take long to figure it out after I did that). While none of the tags have broken, we have lost a few (no fault of the key cabinet), so I'd recommend buying some extra tags just to have on hand."
3,Not quite...right,"I liked this book, it had a great beginning, but it dragged on and on. The ending left me irriated and bored. This book had passion but no heat!"
1,not for farscape fans,This writer doesn't really like farscape. He focuses on inane details and has factual errors. If you don't like farscape this book is for you.
3,Not different from the last one,"This book like its predecessor, is very detailed in the storylines and critiques, however it needs undoubtly some sort of photos to make this book more attractive. This problem I already raised in my comment of the guide for the First Season."
1,A Weak Book,"As with the previous book in this series, you get nice episode recaps paired with thoughtful, careful analysis provided by someone who often does not really understand the show and is completely oblivious of this shortcoming. Criticisms and analysis range from insightful, to trivial, to clearly misguided. I'm getting rid of my copy of this book and wish I had not spent money on it."
4,Inland Temp Trol 100 Soldering Iron,"An excellent product that allows you to adjust the temperature of the iron unlike the new ""improved"" irons that maintain a constant temp that might be too hot/too cool for the particular type of work."
2,"3 chapters of book, the rest preaching","I was very disappointed in the book. I bought it for information that the title promised, and then found that over half of the book is preaching. Be warned before you buy, if you want a long sermon then buy it"
5,Readable and believable!,"When it comes to ""end times"" or apocolyptic books, there's certainly no shortage, from scholarly Biblical dissertations to mass-market ""popular"" books on what lies ahead as foretold in prophecy. Patrick Heron gives us not only a clear, true-to-the-Bible view of what's in store, but lays the foundation by revealing what he believes to be the source of the Great Pyramids and other puzzling ancient structures, from South America to Easter Island. Far from the ""Men from Mars"" approach, Heron sticks with his most reliable source, the Bible, and makes an excellent case for the now-vanished race that he believes was responsible. You can't read this without coming away with a whole new perspective, and you can do so without having to do mental gymnastics to unravel some professional writer's complex presentation. Heron writes directly and clearly, with a passion to share his story that you can't miss. I found it a very illuminating and satisfactory read - highly recommended!"
1,My Expectations were Let Down,"I was hoping for some more information on the latest Nephilim theories with this book. What I found was a guide to the Bible's quotations concerning the Nephilim and a creationist's limited view on the subject. In other words, all I got was a review of what I already knew as a 4th grader in Catholic school. Very disappointing."
5,A Very Fine Work,"I read Mr. Heron's book from cover to cover and I think Craig Hines' review is way off base. Not to mention, I also note that Mr. Hines also has a book coming out this month on a similar subject--could it be that Mr.Hines feels compelled to criticize Mr. Heron's book for his own gain? Think about it."
5,Fascinating!,"Let me start by highly recommending that ""RETURN OF THE ANTICHRIST and the NEW WORLD ORDER"" by the same author (PATRICK HERON)be your next purchase after this one... If you believe the Bible is the word of God, as I do, you will be amazed by what this latest book reveals that is ""hidden in plain sight"" about the identity of the antichrist. This is a must read for all!As to my review of ""Nephilim and the Pyramid of the Apoclypse"", I also consider this an absolute must read! The above mentioned 2 books are, by far, the best I have come across in the last 10 years of eschatological study. They are both plain spoken and easy to read. The audio versions are top notch as well!"
1,Disappointing,"After coming off the back of reading a few of Graham Hancocks books I was interested in reading a different slant on the Pyrimid histories, what I got was a book heavily referencing a narrow channel of biblical passages and way too much assumption and christian prophicies propaganda, it almost insults the inteligence to my mind. If your creationalist and believe the bible word for word then this will appease you, if you believe the world is slightly more complicated and old than that then stay away.Very little is spoken of the pyrimids at all in fact and what is written is weak. But hey thats my opinion. Struggled to take the author seriously and it pained me to read some of his pathetic meanderings about predictions et al.."
2,A little off I feel,"Not a new revelation, except for the pryamid, Zecharia Sitchin brought the Myths from Mesopotamia and the Sumerian Mythology to life, maybe not too far off base! Graham Hancock and Robert Buvale have kinda sealed the rest of the story, I can associate the back ground that Hancock does with James Mitchner!I enjoyed the book as it kinda followed the theme except for the gold encrusted pryamid! Just a side note that maybe the ""Giants"" refered to as powerful people, who were capable of doing things that man at the time couldn't understand! Just my opinion, Thanks"
1,Zechariah Sitchin anyone,"Anyone who believes that Heron's book 'is the first in-depth book to throw light on the mysterious Nephilim and ""to provide evidence of who built the pyramids of Egypt and Mexico and other great monuments of ancient history""' needs to open their eyes and break out their wallets and purchase (and read) Zechariah Sitchin's Earth Chronicles books. (i.e. The 12th Planet, etc) Erich von Daniken has done works regarding this as well. This is not a ""new"" idea. The Bible, Enuma Elish, and several other ancient writings actually do a fairly good job of explaining it too if you read them for what they are without trying to pass things off as being impossible because someone told you so."
5,A MUST READ!!!!!!!,"Ladies and Gentalmen, If ever there was a book worth your time this is it. The Nephilim is that kind of book which comes along very infrequently. If you are at all interested in what our world was like pre-flood and what precipated such a flood you'll find answers in this book that will amayze you and for ever change they way you view our past. Ever better if you are interested in what is coming in our common future, you'll read this book. The way Patrick Heron is able to connect our past to our future will amayze you even more. Scripture will come alive for you and you will be blessed as I have. Bravo Patrick!Eric Thompson"
5,For the searcher,"This is a great read for anyone searching for answers. I am not saying that he has all the answers as he well states, but his research was thourough enough to be convincing. Just read it, then cross reference. I think you will be pleased with the material. Though a bit repetative, I was intrigued by his theories as well as his research."
2,The Nephilim and the Pyramid of the Apocalypse,"Mr. Heron presents some interesting interpretations of biblical scriptures as well as physical phenomenas and attempts to draw irrefutable correlations between the two. In my opinion, anytime an author spends more time trying to convince his readers of the validity of his theories rather simply presenting his case, indicates a lack of confidence in the intelligence of his readers or a lack of clarity in his arguments. Much of the information presented is fascinating in and of itself. Many of the conclusions he professes to be obvious were less than obvious to me and some non-existent. It seems Mr. Haron can be added to the long list of authors who present theory and opinion as fact."
5,"books ,musis.",I have allways got very good service from products that I have order from amazon an its dealers.
2,A little leaven leavens the whole lump,"If people would simply stop using corrupt bible text, a lot of problems would be taken care of. You can clearly see the false conclusians that lead to heresy; Lucifer is the ""Morning Star"", then in the book Revelations Jesus is the ""Morning Star"". When if you would use the KJV bible based on a perfect Old testament Masoretic text in Isa:14:12: How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations! There are tons of corruptions found in the corrupt version he is using; from a virgin will conceive to a maiden will, from David killed Goliath to Elhannon did, from gossip is a bad thing to it's choice morsels,Yahweh instead of Jesus and Jehovah, and etc..... You can see a whole new doctrine in all areas of life compared to the way it should be."
5,Great about understanding an ancient race....in religion,This book is excellent in understanding the pyramids and an ancient race that was coursed. and how it all times in to end time prophecy...
2,Huge Disappointment,"Point blank - The first fully half of the book discusses Nephilim in much the same way as we have heard before, however there are interesting pieces and it is well written, leading the reader to believe that new and exciting angles to the theory are forthcoming. The second half degenerates into a lecture on the Revelations and Armaggedon and exhorts us to mend our ways etc. Repent! The end is near. Ho hum. Never lives up one bit to the promises made in the first half."
4,Nephilim,I have recently read some articles and books on the subject of Angels. This work brings together many differnt points into a cohesive conjecture. THe book draws from the biblical text but also considers some other ancient writings. A very nice read!
4,Interesting Alternative,A pleasure reading an alternative to the dank and dusty guesses of established historians.
4,"Good Assessment, Edward!","(...)It was tons of fun! This guy has a real gift of gab and some mind-opening ideas. However, there was one thing that troubled me. He said that a pyramid is 3 x 3 x 3. I'm not a math person, but Edward J Vasicek's excellent review got me to thinking because Ed is right. A Royal cubit = 7 palms, which is about 18"" to 20"". However, it was his point ""MISSING was the connection between the ""sons of god"" and the UFO phenomenon"" that really caught my eye. In the interview, Heron says that there are no UFOs, but that they come from an alternate reality or other dimension. I'm wondering if this ""alternate reality or other dimension"" wasn't inspired by the TV show, ""Sliders."" Overall, the author offers truly stimulating ideas and is a wonderful writer, but his research skills are a bit bumpy in spots."
2,Interesting but disappointing.,"While the first half of the book has some interesting ideas about ancient Egypt, angels etc it quickly devolves into a crazy Christian book of nonsense. Don't bother buying this book. If you want to read it borrow it from someone but don't spend your money. The authors personal beliefs completely overtake anything that could be of interest."
3,First half was great; Second half was a mess.,"The first half of the book was great because the author was using facts (Bible, etc.) to substantiate his claims. However, the second half was mostly his beliefs. It annoyed me how he kept referring to Jesus as the ""Son of God"" when this is not so. God has no children, family, wife. God is the one and only.The book was poorly edited since I spotted several grammatical errors and geographical mistakes, such as when he said there are ""seven oceans"". Since when?I suggest to the author to re-edit the book and omit the second half of the book and replace it with more information about the actual Nephilim.However, his argument about the Nephilim and the Pyramids is very strong and I would recommend this book to anyone."
2,Poor Title for Book,"I primarily purchased the book because of the title and ""Pyramid of the Apocalypse"". Except for the initial introduction dealing with the measurements and other statistics on the Giza pyramid, nothing else within the book correlated the Nephilim with the pyramid except in the very last chapter.The author seemed to skip around and go off on tangents and did not remain focused on one point/topic at a time. Oftentimes he would repeat the same information over and over again.I did find some useful information (info which basically was the author's conjecture and not factual). The beginning of the book began well but the bulk of it seemed more of a Christian (of which I am one) dialogue on the end times."
3,Works but maybe too well,"Here is the problem. If you dough is larger then your rolling pin then the spacers will roll over the dough. Yes, they give the correct hieght but I don't know if I will use them again unless I have a very small amount of dough."
4,Coin Bag,A good product made of quality material. I have an old bag that I have had for years and the advantage to the old bag it has a draw string top. I would have rated this bag higher if it had the draw string top.
3,Have not used it yet.,"I have not used it yet, but the bag seems to be built sturdy, I was a little dissapointed that it did not come with the big dollar sign that was pictured."
2,Not 1GB when you get it!,The description and pictures shows 1GB but when the item arrived it was actually 512MG. The card works fine so I will keep it. But I will never order from this vendor again.
2,C-,"Used 4 times while car's engine was running. First 3 times were fine. Was so happy. Last time, it ruined cigarette lighter and audio player. Can't find a cause. Can't use both cigarette lighter and audio player anymore. Just lucky that laptop is still OK. Well... good luck."
2,Unreliable,"I purchased several CyberPower brand inverters because this is the only brand in stock at Best Buy. Now I understand why it is still in stock while the other brands are sold out. Sometimes they work and sometimes they do not work. I would classify them as substantially unreliable. The end of the CPS150BI model fell off somewhere in the car because it is so cheaply made. Therefore, I bought a much more expensive CyperPower model before a long road trip because it was the only other inverter immediately available. The new purchase did not work at all. This really affected my daughter's schoolwork because we were on a long road trip and she could not use her computer."
4,Good Overview,"I used this book for a graduate theory class and ended up reading pretty much all of it. The book provides an excellent overview of the major movements during the past 100 years but also misses out on a lot of the most current trends. I believe there were less than 3 articles dated after 1999. The writings seem to be obscure at times, with the editors trying to draw distant similarites between varying fields. Most of the passages used overly pretentious language, so keep a dictionary nearby. This book is not a beginner guide and it helps to have some knowledge of art history as well as a little world history. A better or easier read would have to be ""Theories and Documents of Contemporary Art""..."
3,just O.K.,"my college library had the ""feminist art theory"" volume from this same series, and i LOVED that book to death.since i liked that book so much, i thought it would be a good investment to cash in a recent gift certificate on this hefty volume.i wish that i had gone for the feminist art volume-- it's much more relevant for anyone who is interested in art as political expression... that topic is really not addressed in this anthology.it's probably still good as a reference if you're going to be writing a lot of papers for standard survey courses covering this time period, though."
2,Buy the other same but much cheap book. The Definitive Guide for Professionals,"This Book is excellent, but...Exactly same book as the other book, same authors, same book name with ""The Definitive Guide for Professionals"". This book has more discuss questions. But this price is much higher than the other.I strongly recommend the other one, although I bought both of them."
1,I hate this Book,This book is terrible and most of my classmates concur. For example chapter 5 alludes to certain statistical methods and in essence completely butchers them. As a student I had to use several other resources to pass my classes as this text is useless. If you are an instructor select something else.
4,Instructor,Great book for all Industrial engineers. It does not get completely complicated and relates directly to common day industry practices.
4,The Bead Directory,What a fantastic collection of bead information. Extremely helpful not only as a resource but also in deciding on designs. It made understanding the vast world of beads a lot easier!
1,Latches are either too easy or too tough!,I bought this puzzle for my 2 year old daughter who LOVES puzzles. Especially the puzzles by Melissa and Doug that open and inside are hidden images or magnets.The latch puzzle that we purchased was terrible. The sliding latch door lock simply fell out of the latch when you moved the puzzle - thus was to easy and way to loose. The most disapointing is the window latch and trunck latch. Both these two required adult hand strength to open! I had to hold the puzzle flat with one hand and grip the window latch with the other in order to manipulate it open. And I have very strong hands and it was hard for me (an adult) to open!! Perhaps it was JUST our puzzle. So I returned it. The other puzzles are sold in tight plastic wrap and so we weren't able to TRY another latch to see if it is not so HARD. So that is 3 defunct out of 6 latches that my daughter wasn't able to play with. That's half the toy that wasn't workable or child friendly - and NOT worth the money.
3,"My son loves it, but I don't think it's the best idea",My son loves to open all the doors and see what animals are there to greet him. It is very good quality. The window latch frustrates him because it is a bit to tight to open easily... even a bit too hard for me! We got this as a gift from grandma; I probably wouldn't have bought it myself. Do we really want to teach our adventurous preschoolers to open windows and door chains by themselves?
5,A little too educational =),"My three kids all LOVE this toy. It keeps them busy from little bitty to about 3 yrs. It may be a little too educational because it teaches kids how to unlock just about every lock in the house. It is worth it though, as they have had so much fun with it over and over."
4,Well...,"I'm still not quite sure how I feel about this product. My preschool students (4 years old) seem to really enjoy figuring out how to pop these latches. They do require a lot of assistance, however. Be prepared to provide plenty of help. Also, after a few months of pretty rough play, the latches are breaking. Perhaps this product is intended solely for in-home use, and not for a preschool classroom.As for my 2-year-old...I am finding other ways to promote fine-moter development. I don't see the point in purposely teaching a toddler how to unlock latches and door chains. He has already had enough escape attempts, I don't need to encourage this sort of behavior."
5,I came right on time,Just what I needed....it fit perfectly and was easy to install....car is now running fine and is getting 30 mpg
2,Not as advertised,"This book was advertised as a new book, and it was very obviously used. I was quite disappointed as it was purchased as a special gift for a friend."
1,Bring back Bond,"It is tragic to see bond turned into just another Jason Straham movie. While I loved transporter I would never consider it a Bond. Long gone are the days were bond was classy, classically handsome, smooth, and able to maintain it all while being deadly. Hopefully in a few years they will have a good actor playing bond, and hopefully some better writers too."
1,A miserable affair,"From what was considered the peak in the Bond Franchise with Casino Royale comes this clumsily, ill-directed piece of tripe that is absolutely one of the low points of the entire Bond franchise. Never before has a franchise been raised to its highest levels and then come crashing down to its lowest possible descent. The action scenes are totally confusing and incomprehensible, leaving you frustrated instead of excited and breathless. The main Bond girl is a rather dour affair, not particularly attractive or sexy, and actually just frumpy. And the villian is a wimpy milktoast eurotrash that you don't particularly fear or care what happens to him in the end. It's an extremely pathetic and depressing affair, filled with stale dialogue and a very weak plot. Director Marc Forster should be shot point blank for ruining this franchise."
3,"Mediocre, but I do appreciate films about Cochabamba...","The film tells the fictional secret story behind the Cochabamba Water Wars of 2000 ([...]) that occurred after the government invited privatization of the badly mismanaged state-owned water utility. The political situation was already tense and the multinational that took the contract and massively increased the cost of water overnight merely put match to tinder. Aside from the interesting historical backdrop, this film was disappointing, doing little in terms of character development, unless you consider killing most of the likeable characters as development."
4,Great Blu-Ray,"Quantum of Solace looks amazing in blu-ray and worth the purchase. Great action movie, even if the story isn't as strong as Casino Royale. Still, I was thoroughly entertained the entire way through and the blu-ray looks great. I love Daniel Craig as the new Bond and can't wait for Bond 23."
5,Another Great Bond film,This is the second Bond film starring Daniel Craig. As of now he is my favorite Bond. His James Bond is the closest to the character written by Sir Ian Fleming. Bond is supposed to be the cold eyed killer. I know there are those out there that miss Q and the gadgets but I have enjoyed the last two Bond films much more than all the others. I highly recommend it.
2,Not a Regular Bond Movie,Not a regular James Bond Movie . Previous one was much better.James bond in this movie needs some anger management class. He was upset in most of the scene and would kill all his leads. He didn't made any smart move to get the information .Action wasn't that great .I will never watch this movie again .
2,Is it over yet?,"This movie is just like most other Bond movies except with 30 minutes of story, interaction, and humour edited out. Lots of fancy camera work thou is suppossed to make up for it. There is a skeletal plot based on the events of Casino Royale, but I could hardly understand much or try to care what Bond's motivations are... all you know is that he is pissed for some good reason and he doesn't care about anything except that he is pissed. Craig is given one expression to show, and he looks good showing it. And the movie ends as another Bond movie. Kinda boring and uninvolving, but it looks good I suppose."
5,NEW BOND ROCKS!,"..I gotta say, the new bond kicks ass...I will not go in to details: Daniel C. is a well trained actor, I enjoyed this movie and Casino Royale deeply.I own all bonds movies (22 I think) and movie wise the last two are way superior. Of course Sean C. is the perfect bond, Roger M. is very funny and Timothy D. a well rounded actor (Pierce B. is a joke, and not a good one) but this new one mmm is good. He's major gadget are too overdevelop balls, thanks to the torture from the end of Casino Royale."
2,Worst Bond movie in the Brosnan/Craig era,"This latest installment in the Bond series was on several 'Worst of the year' lists, and rightfully so. Let me first say that I'm a huge Bond fan. I see the film in the theatre and then get the DVD. In some cases, I own both the DVD and the blu-ray of several Bond films. That being said, this movie was terrible in its attempt to be a ""Bond movie"". The reasons are numerous and I won't list them. If you want to see a pretty good action movie, then you will enjoy ""Quantum of Solace"" (though not nearly as much as any installment from the Bourne Trilogy). If you are a die-hard Bond fan seeking a superior follow-up to ""Casino Royale"", then you can safely skip this one."
2,This isn't Bond,"This movie was as close to a waste of time as a Bond movie can get. The action sequences are so busy and disjointed you can't follow what's going on, who's doing what to whom. Forster has taken the jerky action cam thing to the ugly extreme. It's not even coherent enough to make you dizzy...you just sit there completely clueless as to what's going on.What's more, I'm just not down with the whole Bond as a ""blunt instrument"" thing these last two movies are promoting. That is not Bond. Bond is a suave, subtle, nuanced instrument who uses brains and ingenuity, and when all else fails, cool, gee-whiz gadgets...always the polished gentleman, and the ultimate ladies man (one look and they swoon). Daniel Craig is none of those things. I didn't like him as a choice when he was first announced, but decided to withhold judgment. But after two films I'm decided: he's not Bond. Bring on Clive Owen!Quantum of Solace [Theatrical Release]"
1,"New Bond, P-L-E-A-S-E!",I sure hope they don't keep this guy long as James Bond...or atleast give him a chance and give him a good script!
1,"help save Bond, don't buy!","Please, for any fan of the true Bond legacy that wants future Bond movies to stop trying to copy Bourne but to return to the great Bond (renewed) that it was and still can be, please do not buy this DVD. Only $$$$ (or lack of) talks to movie producers. If you buy this DVD then they have no reason to change and I fear Bond 23 will be even worse than QoS. As a Bond fan I was so disappointed in QoS (a Bond plot about saving the water in Chile? are you serious? Think about that) and it will be a sad day if Bond 'jumps the shark'. Now is the time to vote with your purchasing dollars - don't buy QoS DVD! Send a message that the movie producers and writers can do better!"
3,I love Daniel Craig,"Daniel Craig was wonderful as usual, but I was disappointed in this movie. Casino Royale was an excellent movie; however, this one was had too much action and little substance. I hope his next James Bond movie, if there is one, is better than this one."
2,Quantom of Solace,"After his performance in Casino Royal, Craig must have still been asleep in making this flic. Just not as rousing as Bond movies should be."
3,Licence to Experiment,"""Quantum of Solace"" (2008) works better as a companion piece to ""Casino Royale"" rather than a traditional James Bond epic. The film plays like a fragmented novella, which accounts for its 105-minute length (the shortest 007 running time on record). Daniel Craig delivers another solid performance as a tortured, vengeful Bond - definitely the right man for the job. Judi Dench's M gets better with each installment and her chemistry with Craig packs a vital punch. In the low-key villain department, Mathieu Amalric's sociopathic portrayal is reminiscent of Klaus Maria Brandauer's Largo in ""Never Say Never Again"" (1983). Director Marc Forster keeps the thin narrative moving, but seems more comfortable with actors than bone-crunching action sequences. ""Casino Royale"" was a hard act to follow and the Bond producers should be credited for trying a different approach. Based on its own merits, ""Quantum of Solace"" remains a flawed yet strangely compelling 007 entry."
4,action and smooth movie,the movie has a great storyline and Daniel Craig has smooth moves throughout the movie except that the music is a little provocative in the intro.
2,Way too dark for Bond...,"This Bond just misses the mark. It is very dark and depressing and it takes more than 3/4 of the movie before you understand the plot. Poorly written, and it lacks the usual flare associated with Bond movies."
4,"My rating...Action Movie-A- , Bond Movie-D","This is really less of a Bond movie and more of a Jason Statham style action movie. The camera angles and action sequences are reminiscent of ""Crank"" and ""Ronin"". I kept waiting for that classic Bond wit and nifty little gadgets, but they just never arrived. There really isn't even any acting in this movie accept for the stunt doubles. No memorable lines, scenes, etc. It is just one fast-paced roller-coaster ride. I happen to like that, so I wasn't disappointed in this non-Bond action thriller.Will it keep your attention, yes. But is it really a Bond film, hardly."
1,Worst direction and editing in any movie I've ever seen...,If you blink your eyes you will miss a shot because the camera only stays focused for 2 or 3 seconds and then CUT to the next shot - ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE MOVIE. Want to take a good look at one of the actors in this film - good luck. They are on the screen and then off in a flash. This director is pathetic. The actors don't have time to act before it's CUT to the next shot. Garbage. Worst James Bond film ever.
3,Average follow-up that fails to stand alone,"The biggest problem with this movie is that you must have seen the first in the series, Casino Royale, in order to make any sense out of this. Quantum of Solace really is just a continuation of that film in many ways. Secondly, the movie moves so quickly that the plot is impossible to follow. You never get to learn anything about the characters. They could have done so much more with this movie. The movie finally slows down when Bond reaches Bolivia, but much remains unexplained and unresolved. You never really learn what the secret organization is or who is running it. They are powerful enough to try to kill M, but after Bond kills the man responsible for the death of his lover everyone seems satisfied to let it go. Great job of counter-intelligence, MI-6... NOT! I actually think this is the weakest of all the Bond films, and I give it 2.5 stars."
2,"All Action, but No Continuity for a James Bond thriller","Being a James Bond fan, I was very disappointed with the editing, andlack of directing to develop a concrete thriller that James Bond movies normally provide. Scenes would cut mid sentence, then a blow-up scene,then back to another 10 second conversation, then another action scene.It lacked credibility, and seemed bent on minute to minute blow-up actionscenes that didn't make any sense.I should have saved my money, and watched it at the $2 theater instead."
3,"Great, but...","Great movie as far as action films go, but this is supposed to be 007. The charm is gone, and, yes, I am aware of the storyline, but the new bonds are far too gritty and have lost the lightheartedness and satire that was so much the mark of the Bond movies.I don't think that Bond fans are going to the movies to see just another action film; they're going to see James do his thing in that inimitable style that everyone has come to expect. I do believe that this is something new directors don't care about, as they have their own style and wish to put new production values on their work. Understandable, but less endearing to older fans.Movie was short by Bond standards: approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes, so when I was watching the climax, I wasn't aware it was the climax, so the film seemed to end abruptly. Overall, as I said, it was a good movie, but I guess I was expecting more. Sigh."
3,Bring back Pierce Brosnan!!,"While Daniel Craig is ok as James Bond, Quantom of Solace was not a James Bond (Ian Flemming) style film. At the begining we have the dialog between Bond and M where Bond promises not to revenge the death of Vesper. Yet, thats the plot line for the whole movie. The interaction between Bond and ""M"" is dark. Very few clever ""Bond"" lines, not much in the way of ""Bond"" Gagets, even the normal James Bond intro and theme song was missing. Pierce Brosnan is much more the James Bond we have come to know. Audio note: While it is released in DTS Master Audio, it's only a 5.1 mix."
1,Boring Bond,"I really liked Casino Royal, and was hoping for this to be a good/great movie. No, all action and very lacking story. I feel they pumped so much action into this to cover such a slow, boring, story line. I truly like Daniel Craig as bond and was dissapointed that this movie is so average.You'll have more fun playing the video game as bond than watching this movie."
3,SUPERHERO POWERS....,"I didn't realize that James Bond had been endowed with super hero abilities since Casino Royale?Yes, we all know his ability to bed any woman with a mere grin but crushing three grown men in an elevator? Evading a fighter jet? Surviving a fiery inferno? Was I watching Die Hard or a Bond Film? I thought this was a continuation of the fresh Casino Royale film where we saw James Bond tortured and dragged through hell in Venice?This is an action paced movie with very little emotion. I actually got tired of the explosions and shallow dialogue between the main characters and really expected so much more.In a series such as this, directors should be more willing to make a much darker sequel with loose ends, a little bit more dialogue and emotion. It often seemed like body counts were used as substitutes for witty dialogue that characterized Casino Royale."
2,Tried to like it,"I wanted very much to like this movie, but could not. I watched it three times trying to find some reason to rate it more highly. It is only Daniel Craig's excellence in portraying Bond that earns the movie a second star. The plot is non-existent, the characters unengaging, and the action is impossible to follow as the scenes shift all over the globe. Killing off Mathis and chucking his body into a dumpster was an incredibly pointless bit. As others have suggested, the film was more like a compilation of action sequences from the cutting room floor of Casino Royale, which, in my mind, may be the best Bond of all time. And I saw Dr. No in its theatrical release, so I have observed a lot of different treatments of Fleming's character within their generational context. I hope Craig is given better material to work with in the next one. This one crashed aand burned."
3,Almost the same,"as Casino Royale. In fact this is really just a continuance of Casino Royale. The movie lay out was not in the tradition of the other Bond films. For one there are trailers to other movies at the first of this one, the other DVD's don't have those and there is no 007 shooting at the gun barrel at the first like the other Bond films. There other differences I won't get into. I like David Craig. He has more muscle tone than the other Bonds, women will really notice that. This Bond really like drinking. He nearly always has a bourbon or martini glass in his hand. I know the other Bonds drank but you really notice it with this Bond. I didn't like the Bond women. Sort of homely and ugly to me. A lot, I mean lot of action but it was too chaotic for my liking. Camera moved to much it the action scenes. ""Q"" was nowhere to be found but ""M"" was sure around. I like the other Bonds better."
2,"Disapointed, Casino Royale is 5stars!","After watching Casino Royale... then this.. disapointed, it was just plain boring.. like watching a tv series. No flavor. Casino Royale was 5 stars to me, it had that flavor."
3,Ok,I forgot that I had seen this movie already. It's a good movie as long as you are a James Bond fan. A lot of action.
4,3rd place finish for Craig as Bond.,"Casino Royale was a great introduction for Daniel Craig as James Bond. This was a somewhat disappointing follow up. If you love Bond, you'll enjoy the movie, don't get me wrong. Just not the best Craig version."
3,Not Daniel Craig's Best Bond Movie,"If you are a Bond fan/completionist, of course you need to see this movie. That being said, this was neither my favorite Bond movie, nor my favorite appearance by Daniel Craig as James Bond."
4,The Daniel Craig Bond is something new.,"It's hard to talk about the Daniel Craig Bond, and particularly this movie, without using the word ""gritty."" So, there you go. Last summer, I read all the Bond novels in order. Daniel Craig's portrayal of Bond is more like the Ian Fleming vision than any of the previous actors', including, even, Sean Connery. This is easily the most sober of the Bond films. Lots of exciting action, only over-the-top in the same way as are the action scenes, in say, the Bourne movies. (And the fight scenes seem clearly to owe much to the Bourne films.)That said, to be successful, Craig is going to have to tweak it a bit. We can enjoy a more serious and realistic Bond, as an offset to the serial nonsense which are the Roger Moore films. But he can't be a total downer indefinitely. We're going to want to like the guy at some point and we're going to need at least a little of that Bond humor."
3,Mediocre Quantum,DVD quality shakey at best as there were several scenes that would not play. Excellent James Bond movie disrupted by scene skips.
4,Excitement at a Very Fast Pace,"I like this Bond, and he is the epitome of the harshness and down and dirty attitude of what a Bond character should be. Not entirely lacking in the proper British procedure, this Bond is fully knowledgeable in the art of full departure of authourity. I liked the movie, but I was just a little annoyed by its super fast pace and the story line, which I felt could have been punched up with the magic that most of the Bonds acquired from Q division. Each Bond actor has given their all to this worthy character and Mr. Craig is definately a keeper. I look forward to well thought out plots, filled with the gadgetry and the confident and intelligent, ""James Bond."""
3,Okay movie in the Bond series,Movie came in a timely fashion. Not one of the best James Bond movies but I liked it anyway.
1,"Great movie, just couldn't watch it at home","I guess I missed the fine print about the format of this particular dvd. I was unable to play it on my home dvd player. So, I wasted my money. If Amazon is selling dvds with different formats, then putting the particular format in big bold letters would have prevented this sort of thing."
4,Not as good as Casino Royale,"Still good. Really regret not reading the fine print about streaming HD movies before I bought it, and had to revert to standard def just to play it over my PC. However, that didn't influence my rating. Still give it 4 out of 5."
5,Craig is one of my all time favorite Bonds.,"Continuing the reboot, I really enjoy the more action style of the new Bond. This one felt a bit darker, as bond felt like he was a lot more out of control but I really enjoyed the story telling and the action scenes."
5,Satisfactory,"This is the most worst looking 007 agent I have seen so far. Action is not so good as I thought a 007 movie would have. That's a disappointment. But based on the quality of the picture and audio of the DVD, it's superb. It's a one sided DVD, which means one side having the label of the DVD and other side having the movie."
4,"A good Bond movie, not a great Bond movie","Among all the argument of the ""best Bond"" actors, Daniel Craig brings a grittiness that harkens back to Sean Connery's original portrayal. QOS picks up where Casino Royale leaves off, and while CR is among the very best of the 20+ Bond movies for action and plot depth, QOS begins just as strong but fizzles at the end. This is still a great action movie, if you can suffer through the final 15 minutes, and a good addition to the Bond series. The supporting cast is outstanding - Casting Judy Dench as M a few movies ago was a stroke of genius, and she continues to expand the role beyond any predecessor. The remaining cast of repeat and fly-by characters are well-cast and well-acted. The opening chase scenes are not to be missed. It's just unfortunate that the final scenes are filmed in a soundstage-turned amusement park ride that is a little too much in the vein of a debacle like Moonraker (which is the very worst Bond movie in the entire series)."
2,"Bond, Jane Bond","The producers made a mistake casting Daniel Craig as Bond. I mean a BLONDE James Bond? Whatever happened to tall, DARK and handsome?Perhaps, it is not Craig's fault but more the producers' and directors'. Craig's Bond is kind of a perfunctory action figure. There are plenty of kicks and punches but he is strangely cold and lifeless, just like someone who's had a lobotomy. The previous characterizations by Sean Connery, Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan are full of British wit and humour to say the least.Finally, there was a shot of Craig in the earlier movie rising out of the sea in square trunks ala Ursula Andress and Halle Berry. What are the producers trying to do? Capture a slice of the pink market? I mean, Bond is as straight as hell. Jane Bond anyone?"
3,Long for the old Bond...,"The newer Bond films with Craig have lots of showy special effects but also are much darker, more depressing themes. What happened to the Bond most of us knew & loved which were exciting, stylish & still had a touch of humour? If I'd known the character of the previous Bonds had been totally changed I would not have bought the last release. I long to really be entertained by Hollywood...real life can be dark enough and I need films that make us forget reality and our entertaining."
3,Not the best Bond flick..,"This just fell short of my expectations. I loved Casino Royale and the latest one, Skyfall.. but just didn't like this film. However, I did like the reference to Goldfinger with respect to how someone was ""offed."""
3,Boring,I was disappointed with this movie. Not too much of a story line. Too much shooting and explosions. Please bring back Sean Connery!
4,Subtle James Bond with fantastic locations,"In this movie, the key is to have recently seen Casino Royale -- and pay attention to the details! We see the transformation of Bond into the almost heartless spy who masks all his feelings, following the events in CR."
4,Typical Bond,"This Bond movie contained the special effects and car chases we have become used to. I cannot say that the BluRay version was any more spectacular than the normal DVD. Daniel Craig plays the part well with a bit of ambiguity as to wether he is more man than machine. All in all, it was fun to watch."
4,"Excellent in general, less than Casino Royale and Skyfall","I'm a huge fan of 007. Daniel Craig is right up there at the top as my favorite actors to portray Bond. Quantum is a lot of fun and is an excellent movie. Why a 4 star rather than a 5 star? I consider this to be the least of Craig's efforts in the role of Bond, and I want there to be some room to distinguish Casino Royale and Skyfall. But overall, this is a great watch and a lot of fun."
1,Unable to view,"The system did not tell me that it would not be compatible . . .Unable to view it at all, but I paid for it!"
1,wrong format,"Cannot play on player...Believe it to be a foreign format and should have been advertised that way...If possible, would like credit for this item..Can also return if possible"
3,Quantom of Solice,OK i`ll make it short and to the point ! Quantum of Solace is no Casino Royale but if you are a big James Bond fan like I am its a must have . I enjoyed the movie . It was not the best but it was far from the worst Bond Feature . Daniel Craig is a great Bond and I am sure he well be for many years to come !
2,lousy playback experience,"my playback is via a samsung blu-ray bd-p2500/sony xbr4 lcd tv. the picture quality for q.o.s. sucked at various points in the movie where the picture appeared to waver like a mirage for a few minutes. yeah! it wasn't the shot in the desert ;-) and the parts of the picture in the cave (and other dark scenes) were terrible with a lot of colour contours being seen... even tho we really like the movie, this blu-ray dvd sucks (at least on our system) so only 2 stars!"
4,Hot and fast,"Daniel Craig once again proves himself as a masterful Bond. Not quite as good as the first one, but well worth viewing again and again."
4,"action, action","We saw this movie at the theater, and were equally impressed with the Blu-Ray. We enjoyed the shift from suave and swarmy, to deadly and committed. The extra detail provided by Blu-Ray is awesome and well worth the few extra dollars."
4,"Awesome, but needed a bad guy.",I really like this movie. I loved Casino Royale. And this movie feels like an extention of that movie. Craig is again awesome as James Bond. Pretty darn close to be the best James Bond of the whole series. (It's really tough to beat Sean Connery). The only thing that holds this movie back a little was the villian. James Bond has always had classic memorable villians. And the short guy in this movie was not scary or intimidating and not memorable. And James Bonds needs a challange. I'm already looking forward for the next Bond Movie. I hope Craig stays on for a long time. One thing that has stayed consistant is the beautiful women. Quantum of Solace definitely has hot women. But also another draw back is that there was no Female villian. There is nothing hotter than a dangerous Bond Girl.
4,Bond has a quantum amount of solace,"Although not as good as Casino Royale, this one is acceptable, following Bond from the anger of the woman who tricked him, to his conclusion that she indeed loved him and died for him, as Bond attempts to foil the plot of an unknown organization whose power reaches even MI-6 ranks. Action-packed and great stunts!"
3,action packed,"Lots of action, hard to follow. There needs to be a little more story to go with the action, it left me confused."
3,not as great but not bad,This lacks a lot of what casino Royale gave us but as a continuation of the same story its a good slow down soul searching film
1,Poor Choice,"This movie is loud, rambling and uninteresting. I was unable to view it for more than 20 minutes. Not my cup of tea. Totally different fromCasino Royale."
2,"No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to make sense!","By the time we got to the inexplicable exploding luxury hotel in the middle of nowhere, this movie had completely lost me. Take a closer look at the artwork on the cover of this DVD and you'll see what I'm talking about. It pictures James Bond walking off into a vast wasteland while this ridiculous prop burns in the background. What a perfect metephor for this turkey.Has it come to this? Does Mr. Big's big plan for global domination really involve jacking up the price for water in Bolivia? I was waiting for him to stick his little finger in his mouth and demand ""One Million Pesos!""Bomb, James Bomb."
3,Somewhat poor James Bond film-- seems unfinished,"There were parts like the beginning that were quite good, but as the movie lingered on, I got the idea that something was missing, that somewhere along the way they could not afford, or did not put the time into making this a James Bond Masterpiece; far from that and lacking the old James Bond charm of the old movies, and incomprehensible and poor special effects in parts especially when matched up against some of the 007 capers in the past. Ending almost incomprehensible and appears they lacked money to give the special effects am used to, but still worth seeing as it beats most of the garbage in the theatre now-a-days. I never knew missing M, could ruin this series so badly, what a shame."
1,A Must Miss Bond Film,"After watching all of the Bond films from Dr. No to Die Another Day, including Never Say Never Again, and then watching Casino Royale, I thought ""Good lord, they can't make another Bond film as bad as this"", but they have in Quantum of Solace. Not only does it bring in all the inaccuracies of Casino Royale i.e. cell phones and other modern technology as well as M being a woman, but there is no real storyline. It is not a Bond film, it is 102 minutes of explosions and gunfire. Bond films have always, until Casino Royale, had just the right amount of action and story. Hopefully this will be the last Bond movie with Daniel Craig. Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace ruined James Bond.Do not buy this DVD unless you are 8 years old and all you care about is CGI and no story."
1,quantum of solace,"In the tradition of doing a Bond film, you must follow in the long line of previous films to a certain degree, this film has totally lost the mark on that point. Plot is weak, the acting is cold and hard, the action shots are cut so fast and tight you can hardly understand what's going on. The classy, clever Bond films have been annihilated by senseless action scenes supporting a weak plot."
2,rating DVD quality not film,"I will buy my DVD's at the store from now on. I thought the price was great. You get what you pay for!!!! I pre-ordered it, but when I put my BRAND NEW DVD in the player it said it was dirty, I cleaned it 3 times and it finally played. I watched half of it, turned it off and the next day when I tried to play it again, it said it was dirty. I tried it in another DVD player and it said NO DISC. So it was not my TWO players. Everything else I""ve played lately has worked. Very disappointed."
3,Bring back Pierce Brosnan!,"I'm sorry, but Daniel Craig just isn't James Bond. He's too serious, unfunny and too rugged looking. Pierce Brosnan picked up where Roger Moore left off, delivering those quick one liners with cool, dry humor, personality and smooth style (Timothy Dalton was also a dud, IMO).This movie has a good enough story to be a deserved part of the James Bond legacy, but it doesn't have the balance of action and humor that the old Bond movies of yore had. Too serious, not enough fun--blah. Three stars since it fires on all action cylinders, but it could have been better.Another thing...M sends down a young, hot looking woman to drag Bond back to England. Hello! Like James Bond isn't going to manipulate her in his favor any less than any other hot chick?? That was a dumb part of the story. Now if M had sent Jaws down there to collect Bond, he might have been more submitting!"
2,Quark of So-So,"Quantum of Solace does not live up to the promise of Casino Royale. Although director Marc Foster has done great work in the past with Monster's Ball, Finding Neverland, and The Kite Runner, Foster's not an action director. Sorry, he's not. Character, story, and action are neither shaken nor stirred but scrambled. Daniel Craig can do so much more than jump from one stunt to the next as he does here - see Layer Cake, Defiance, and yes, Casino Royale."
2,A Big Step Backwards From Casino Royale,"I was not a Bond fan prior to Casino Royale. However I loved it and thought Daniel Craig was excellent. I was looking forward to QOS and boy was I disappointed. Weak script, lousy pacing, silly villains and mindless action sequence after mindless action sequence. What a letdown. This was a step backward in my opinion for the series. Casino Royale was a shot in the arm for an ailing franchise. If QOS is a sign of what's to come, I won't be along for the ride."
5,One of my Favorite Bond Films,"I have no idea why people hate this movie? The story follow pretty close to the one in Casino Royale and the action is off the hook. I almost didn't get it based on what people said then I realized the general public belongs in a zoo, so I got this movie and LOVE IT!!!!!!! If you're a Jim Bond fan, this is the movie for you. If you don't like it, don't buy it!"
1,Absolutely amazing...,"Not the movie. But the fact that a movie can be so great and entertaining and it's sequel is lamentable. Don't waste your time on this. Watch Casino Royale again. The plot of QOS makes absolutely no sense, the fighting scenes are brutal, the entire film is boring and dull, I can't understand what the villain is saying, and the Bond girls aren't particularly pretty. The lead has some weird scar or burn on her back (as the character) and it's ugly. Sexy Daniel Craig scowls throughout. He does his best; it's the script that's terrible."
1,Quantum of Emptiness,"Sorrowfully, I watched approximately 30 minutes of this drivel, has the world gone mad? A movie needs a real plot, sheer violence, noise, blood and mind trash won't fill the bill. I feel sorry for those with a favorable review, for it means that they have settled for the very least in entertainment, flying bodies in chase scenes, which occur every few minutes, and moving so fast through the cameras lens that they are indiscernable as whether they are villian or ''secret agent''. A sensible reason for this mass slaughter escapes the movie, with a thin, and transparent story line. I can get pretty much the same line of entertainment in ''South Park'', and even that makes more sense. Hopefully, I wait for another ''Bourne'' movie, with a real plot, some human relationships, and violence where necessary, not as the main theme. Count this one out.."
4,Finishes the story,"Still the badass Bond of Daniel Craig - who is my new #1 007, with Connery as a very close second - but not near the excitement of Casino Royale. It does, however, begin right were Casino left off, and finishes the story nicely. Looking forward to seeing the third Craig installment in theaters soon."
4,A Classic,If you like action movies you will love this. Very good. Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Connery. Well executed
1,the hell?,"after seeing Casino Royale, i assumed that whoever was in charge of the James Bond franchise was doing everything they could to make it fantastic. then i saw Craig's sequel... what a motherloving let down! Quantum of Solace, the best thing about it was its title.in short, Casino Royale might be the best Bond movie ever. Quantum is one of the worst i've seen. oh, how the mighty have fallen. the third Craig Bond film will make or break the franchise, i believe. and a tip for the writer, allow James to have sex with a woman who actually survives!D"
2,Disappointment,"After seeing Casino Royale, I decided the new Bond was okay. I liked the more serious Bond and Daniel Craig did an admirable job. But The Quantum Solace was a big disappointment. Nothing hung together. You didn't know what was going on half of the time and the acting was below average as was the directing. It was like most action films today, just a lot flash and nothing more. Was this a Bond Film? This is a good time for Bond to die and be gone forever."
2,Try again,"Being a James Bond fan since Dr No,I see the Bond films declining with every new film.If you haven't seen Casino Royall,you will never figure this Bond out .All the plot lines seemed to have vanished,replaced by disconnected action.I buy as I have all the others,but I do not know why."
2,"Enough, already.........","Okay, we get it. Bond became Bond because he went through a rough patch, losing his main squeeze, in the days before he knew how to pick out a dinner jacket. Time to move on. The first wave of Bond films were succeeded because they gave us a character whom we could like and, more importantly, envy. Connerys' Bond did everything with a wink, whether it was snapping a neck, critiquing a disappointing brandy, or nailing the blonde hottie whom he'd seduced away from the main bad guy. THAT'S why the men in the audience wanted to BE him and the gals........well, YOU know!Now, I ask you, who in his right mind would care to switch places with Craigs' angry, brooding son of a bitch? What woman would feel safe with him, considering his hair trigger temper? None with any sense, would be my guess. The films brief homage to Goldfinger was very telling, I thought. In 1964, the dead girl on the bed was painted a shimmering gold. In 2009, she was oily black. Point taken.Norm"
1,Where's the beef?????,"Boy what a piece of junk this film is. This one has got to be playing the Man with the golden gun turkey award card from the 70's. Reducing Bond to a simple action hero/stunt man gag is no laughing matter. Boring, incomphrensible chase scenes, cardboard villains, Attention Deficit disorder film editing and a total lack of respect for the series backround soundtrack and famous opening scene moving circle shoot. This piece of trash left me shaken and stirred. Where oh where is Goldfinger, Casino Royale, OHMSS, From Russia, and Octopussy???? Bond? no Bland!!!"
1,Could have done better with a home camera,"I really would like my money and my time back for watching this movie. It was one disappointment after another, this was movie making 101 Grade School. Did the editors even see the finished product? What ever happened to making one scene go with the other. I like action but only If i can figure out whats going on! when you think of James Bond you think best movie of the year, this was the worst movie in the last 2 years. Inexcusable, I'm sure the producer didn't even try to make it better. What was the point of this movie?"
2,Depressing & gratuitous action,"One of the worst Bond movies I have ever seen. Dark, brooding, depressing, and filled with overly contrived, gratuitous action sequences. Very dissapointing."
2,Emotionless . . .,". . . or, that's what I sensed. I could not connect with the character - James Bond - in this movie. For me, it was as though he was a hard, unfeeling bot.With the editing and screenplay, I thought the movie was trying to copy the Bourne movies - especially where they made a lot of quick cuts to create a scene. I do not think their style of editing worked very well.James Bond *is* James Bond - they have no need to copy anyone else.I have enjoyed James Bond since Sean Connery first played in Dr. No. And I would own all of the James Bond movies - except for this one. Frankly,I have no desire to own this DVD - no matter what the price."
2,:(,"i am more upset because this wont play on my PS3 because it says ""region b only."" which to me is complete rubbish. I was just hoping to be able to watch this movie with no issues and now it doesnt even work. SUCK!"
2,Confusing and an unlikable Bond,"I have long been a fan of James Bond movies. But each succeeding Daniel Criag movie leaves an increasingly sour taste. I never bought this when it originally came out (I have all the movies up to Craig's ""Casino Royale"") because I was disappointed with the first of Craig's Bonds. But I started this at a cardio-cinema, was confused with what was going on and decided to watch it so I could figure it out. I did. But I didn't figure it out. Seemed like just a lot of violent action with a hard-to-follow plot. Just not good enough to have to watch it repeatedly in order to ""get"" it. Never had to do that with the old Bonds (all of them). I no longer like James Bond movies. Period. Very, very disappointing. (My spouse didn't like it either and he is the ultimate Bond fan)"
3,"Good value on Blu Ray & DVD, below average Bond movie","I love the James Bond movies, so even an average 007 flick is a good time, but I'd have to admit this is one of the weakest 007 films. The villain and Bond girl are not memorable at all. If you like 007, then surely you've probably seen it. If you're trying to get someone into 007, I wouldn't start with this film."
3,More like Jason Bourne,"Daniel Craig brings a solemnity and sadness to James Bond that makes him more like a government approved Jason Bourne than the caddish, suave ladies man we've all come to love. Gone is the humor and charisma. Now it's just another assassin. Disappointing. I like Daniel Craig, but this new incarnation of James Bond is just no fun at all."
2,Boring,Wanted to like it. Like Daniel Craig. It became boring and it never got better. I'm looking forward to the next one. I hear it is the best. This one? Not so much.
2,Going downhill,"The first Bond film with Daniel Craig definitely set the tone for and grittier bond which is less light hearted. This movie is no different. What really makes this movie less than a traditional Bond film and less than Casino Royale is the storyline which is rough in some areas and totally unbelievable scenes (building exploding in the desert, machine guns never hitting their targets etc.) (I got that the building was powered by fuel cells)."
3,Quantum Ho Hum,"The movie is too cluttered with fast action, and special effects, and not enough personal interaction and emotion for my tastes. The movie filned in some exotic locations, but far too little footage of the scenery. My personal choice for best Bond movies were the Roger Moore Bond movies, with Sean Connery second."
3,the usual Bond fare,"Exactly what you'd expect from a Bond movie, which is always somewhat more disappointing than you'd expect. If you want lots of action, with car chases, assassinations, unbelievable chases of all sorts, this fits the bill."
3,Disappointing,Continuity of storyline takes backseat to over-the-top special effects. This could have been a great movie with good direction. Annoying.
2,Confusing,"I sat there thinking for most of the movie ""what is going on"". The action scenes in the movie were great though."
2,What's wth the 'lightning action scene' edits?,"Love Daniel Craig. Love the modern, more serious Bond. Hate the ultra fast edits during the action sequences that can't allow the viewer to process the drama. Booo!!!"
3,Imagine Bond As GI Joe,"As a Bond fan, I was dismayed when I heard Daniel Craig was going to be assuming the role, Daniel Craig as Bond in this film is about a subtle as a hammer through a window. There's no mystery here, only an endless body count and a rare bout of sex. Bond is little more than child in this role who successfully allows his vendetta to run its course by destroying just about everything in his path save Vesper's lover. It only gets more hard to follow when you throw in 'Bolivia Intelligence' former or not, into the mix. The question also begs to be asked, MI6 has cutting edge technology but you can't give an agent a bulletproof vehicle or any serious heavy duty firepower? Sigh) I'd give anything for someone to walk in and give Bond a brain along with a mystery to solve. There's no detective work, it's just Bond killing bad guys who presently themselves all too conveniently. Welcome to the new Bond - GI Joe in a suit and tie in & out of the bedroom."
3,Good action but lame plot and no Bond feel,"Watched this a week after Casino Royale and its plot still made little sense to me (its a sequel to CR). Couldn't get into the characters. Bond's ""rogue"" status didn't seem much different than how he acted in CR. We didn't get any Bond toys. There was some intense hand to hand battles which surely was inspired by the Bourne series (same as in CR). Overall very forgettable."
2,Disjoined Effort,Poor editing or something went wrong when putting this film together.First installment was much better.
3,Scintilla of Effort,"Language, character development, master shots all go away with the wind in this Daniel Craig sequel to the wonderful first effort,""Casino Royale."" Not one character, good or evil, slows the hectic pace or frenetic camera work. It's one thing to employ true international thugs, but can they utter clear English, here, as if there really is a working script? Scowling, pissed-off, characters throughout do not make an enjoyable experience. Car chase, airplane chase (a DC-3 out-flying a high-performance turbo?);isolation cave;explosions,Bond wins. Calling Roger Moore...come in Roger. A grade-school effort by Mr. Forster who flunks Hitchcock or Terence Young 101. Looked throughout like it was shot by Michael Moore's baseball hat cam."
4,007 Enthusiast,"My kids and I enjoy all of the James Bond movies. Some are definitely better or worst than others. This is one of the best. We like Daniel Craig, he is one of the best bonds too, in our opinion."
2,The film was just flat like a two day open cola,"Change up on the intro was nice and the Starting sequence was working-- then, when the cast landed in Bolivia the air just went right out of the film. It just couldn't get anything going...right down to the Gold Finger rip off of the dead girl on the bed in the hotel room--covered in gold--black gold, Texas tea. You get the point. I like the new Bond but the film was a let down."
4,Bond,If you like Bond movies you will like this one. There is lots of action throughout the entire movie. Great car chase scenes along with spectacular stunts.
3,It's STILL a BOND FILM,"Many people complain that QoS veered into the direction of Jason Bourne (funny their initials are the same)... I would be hard pressed to disagree with those people. However, Craig as Bond is a much darker character and so close to what Fleming originally depicted, that it is hard to say this is a bad film rather than say it is STILL A BOND FILM!Definitely something you need to watch as a Bond fan, and whether you enjoy it or not, it explains some things from Casino Royale that were worth explaining.It isn't one I would pop in the DVD player every day to watch, as I could do with Casino Royale, Goldfinger or Goldeneye, but if it's on TV, I'm not turning it off either."
3,James Bond 007,"Its was ok, they tried to make a sequel to Casino Royale which has never been done before in the 007 franchise. Skyfall turned out to be better."
3,Entertaining James Bond movie.,"Our 13 year old grandson had never seen a James Bond movie, so he and I rented this one. Not the best Bond movie, but entertaining."
1,Quantum of Solace=CRAP,"As an 11 year old boy who has seen every Bond film, I must say ""Bond, you are awesome."" After seeing QoS, I must say, ""Bond, you suck."" This movie has no humor whatsoever. With no plot and ugly Bond girls, no wonder this is the WORST AND MOST BORING MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE! I litteraly cried when I saw that the ""Gun Barrel Scene"" was at the beggining. It was at the end. Why did they make this movie? Were they mental? I don't know Bond anymore. Thanks to the people who made this movie, the once great Bond francise now sucks. P.S.- What was QoS even about, anyway?"
1,WORST JAMES BOND EVER!!!,"Saw this flick at the theatre when it first came out because I had highly anticipated it. I have never been a fan of the shaky, fast motion camera work (ie Bourne Identity) and this movie is full of it. The story was boring and I quickly started losing interest. It was a terrible letdown as I thought Casino Royale was fantastic. I literally fell asleep in the theatre during this one (I am not joking) it was so boring.A huge letdown to say the least...Someone please get a new writer and director (bring back Casino Royale's director!!)"
5,Quantum of Solace,"It is very strong in the action scenes and visual effects, so it makes you very hyper during the movie. This is the best action Bond movie I think so far, and you will definitely enjoy watching it."
5,Much better than expected,"This is one of the best Bond movies I've ever seen. Maybe I just clicked with it or, perhaps, it is the cinematographic skill of the production team. I usually don't care much for action scenes as they are terribly repetitive and boring, however this film put me on the edge of my seat - it was fun, unpredictable and sophisticated. Daniel Craig did a fantastic job! Subtle humor and great visual effects made the watching experience that much more enjoyable. I can't wait to see the next installment."
2,Meh...,Honestly i was expecting a lot more from this movie. Casino Royale was so well done that this one should have lived up to its predecessor. The story was just not as entertaining and the only good part was a real car chase which Casino Royale did lack.
5,Great Bond Movie,Really Loved it.I wanted to watch it before I went to see the new movie.I recommend this to everyone.
3,Good Movie true to the James Bond image,"There are a lot of reviews on this movie, so many of you will probably not read down to this review. But I felt like I had to make a comment about the audio. Even though the case might seem to indicate English Dolby Digital there is no track for English Dolby Digital. The English track is only in DTS Master. If you have an older receiver as I do, that only has Dolby Digital, you will not get the full effect of the Digital Hi Def sound. It is some what of a disappointment, because the movie industry has standardization for audio on current movies released on DVD, which should probably also include Blu Ray releases, to be Dolby Digital. The sad part is that with the amount of storage available on Blu Ray, they should have made the default audio track Dolby Digital and an optional audio track for the DTS. I now get to go backwards in time and listen to the audio in Dolby Pro Logic."
1,Goldfinger Got His Wish,"""No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die."" Well, he has. I detected serious illness in Casino Royale, and now he is gone. His replacement is a grim, humorless, unsophisticated thug who should be armed not with a PPK but with a spiked club. He shows no dedication to Queen, country, or right. He is quite repulsive. He goes, not to beautiful, exciting places, but to squalid collections of shacks and featureless deserts (which is a good place for him, I admit). His adversary is about as interesting as a bowl of porridge. Ah, well. We have The Twenty (or 21, if you, like me, rather like NSNA). Farewell, James. A pity that the tiny hands of Cubby's successors could not hold your greatness, nor their tiny minds appreciate what made you great."
2,Bond recession or Bourne wannabe.,"I am 42 yrs old movie junkie, but never felt compelled enough to write a review until this one. Call me dinosaur, or even stupid. But what is a Bond movie without scoring sexy girls and spectacular finale? If you want to see Bourne, why would you even bother with this?If you want something real, go for a documentary. The fact that ticket sales jump up during recession is a proof that people want to escape the reality. So where is the fantasy we paid for?"
3,The Bond Identity (Crisis),"When did James Bond become Jason Bourne? Please don't tell me that this Bond is the closest thing to Ian Fleming's Bond--that means you haven't read the books. This series has a tremendous identity crisis. I thought that the reason for the release of Brosnan and the hiring of Craig was to ""start over"" and return to the roots of the series. When's that happening? This film was loud, kinetic, frenetic, and quite pathetic. This wasn't a Bond movie--it was ""The Bond Identity (Crisis)."" Oh, yeah, but I will still buy it on DVD. It's no worse than View to a Kill."
3,Good moving but missing some 007 traits,"Of course this was a good movie to watch but it was missing some of the 007 traits I would have expected. I don't think this is going to be a classic like the others. For example I do not recall a single time where he says ""Bond, James Bond"" ... in the originals it was an expected line and I don't recall hearing it. Also it lacks the gadgets that I look forward to seeing. Maybe they remember to add in the traditional traits on the next 007 movie :)"
4,Good continuation,This movie is a good bond movie but not even close to as good as casino royale. This is a continuation of the syoryline from casino royale and well worth watching but I compare this movie to the empire strikes back in the star wars trillogy; a good story but still feels incomplete. Hopefully they make another bond movie that continues the story and finishes it.
4,"Like the action, miss the gadgets.","One of my favourite parts of the older Bond movies was the spy tech.The hard action is great, but the humour & gadets need to come back too."
4,Action from start to finish,We watched Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace back to back not knowing that they were basically two parts to a story. They were action packed from start to finish. Daniel Craig is my new favorite 007.
2,Weak characters make a bad film.,"No Bond here; a bust instead. Mediocre plot, flat dialogue and numbing chases through grey settimgs.It was a boring Bond without a clear nemisis."
3,Not The Usual Bond,"This movie was okay but not what you expect from James Bond. It was more like Jason Bourne. I don't think I really cared for a revenge minded Bond. Plus you never find out what happened or what was said when he finally found the guy he was looking for during the whole film. All in all, kind of disappointing."
3,Editing is too fast,Hi. I found the action editing on this movie so bad.... so fast... that I had to watch it in slo mo just to get it.Note to director: if you're going to cut this fast then at least use steadycam. Filming Bond run up stairs using a hand-held looks like I shot it at home!Producers - PLEEEEASE don't use this director again!!!?
2,"What a let-down after the brilliance of ""Casino Royale.""","Loved ""Casino Royale."" Love Daniel Craig as James Bond. Didn't think much of this film, however. Surprisingly poor direction and a script that is confusing and non-engaging.Example: At the end, when Bond confronts the villain, ""Green"" states that he's told Bond everything he wanted to know about Quantum. Problem is, the viewer has never seen this scene in the film!! Incredible, and the fault of the director.The action scenes have nice set-up, but are also very poorly directed; with the viewer never really sure what's going on.The theme song by Jack White is the weakest ever for a Bond film, and completely absent is thetrademark Bond theme song.Even the sound quality is weak, with much of the dialogue incomprehensible. (This is the only time I've ever had to go to the subtitles just to understand what the female lead is saying.Hoping this director doesn't destroy another Bond film."
3,disappointing and very average,"I had high expectations given how great ""Casino Royale"" was and this film disappointed in almost every regard. Its not a bad film and its not among the many bad bond films. Its just another very ordinary James Bond film.The idea of doing it as a sequel and focusing on the death of someone from the previous film was a big mistake. The film was too much about things that had happened before and that tended to drag it down. It also gave it a completely aimless plot.The action scenes were also very poorly constructed. Everything they got right in ""Casino"" they get wrong here. Everything is shot at fast forward in ""shaky cam"". The result is a muddy blur where half the time its not clear whats going on.The film was also too obviously political. We have a water crisis and eco-hotels. Water wells and ultramodern hotels blowing up are just not interesting."
1,Received defective blu ray discs...twice,"I ordered this movie on blu ray, and it was defective when it arrived. Amazon quickly shipped a replacement which was also defective. Neither would play in my blu ray player. Other blu ray discs, included one ordered at the same time played fine, so it was not an issue with the player. Amazon has been excellent about taking the returns, however, it appears they may ave received a defective batch."
3,Bond is awesome!,"Weak storyline, in fact it is easily forgettable. But the stunts and action in this movie make it worth the buy. This movie was created while there was a writers strike in Hollywood. Because of this, I think the plot suffers a bit."
3,Quark of Blah,"Much inferior to its predecessor, ""Casino Royale."" What happened? Some interesting setup, and then we learn it's All About Water, that American spies don't bat an eyelash about sanctioning the murder of a British spy for reasons of allegedly exigent foreign policy, and other such nonsense. Some interesting bits and shots, and Craig is a better Bond than most who have played him, but there's no there there. After having seen it in the theater, I was too bored to watch it all again on the DVD. Disappointing, especially since ""Casino Royale"" was a much-needed and riveting re-boot of the series."
3,Not As Good As 1st,"I liked this movie, but I was a little disappointed after watching it because it's not nearly as good as ""Casino Royale."" However, I have already watched it twice at the movies & twice since it's been on DVD, so it's not bad to me obviously."
4,"Good Movie, Not as Good as ""Casino Royale""","I'm really enjoying the ""reboot"" of the Bond series that Daniel Craig has brought on, but ""Casino Royale"" is a tough act to follow. I did enjoy ""Quantum of Solace,"" but some of it fell just a little flat for me. I didn't care as much about the Camille character as I did about Vesper from ""Casino Royale."" It felt like there was a certain amount of depth left out... Like, with ""Casino Royale"" you could say ""That was great!"" but with ""Quantum of Solace"" you inevitably added the obligatory suffix - ""That was great... for a Bond movie.""Which is, again, not to say I didn't like it - I did. I just had super high hopes after ""Casino Royale"" that didn't quite get lived up to."
2,This is Bond?,"Where is the humor? Where is the over-the-top gadgets? Where is the story telling? Where is the romance? Where is the FUN?The new Bond movies are just bland pathetic action flicks. This could of been any ordinary spy thriller. Nothing ""Bond"" about the new ""Bond"".The franchise is dead...."
1,What the,"Why on earth would anyone THINK that changing angles every 2-3 seconds for the entire length of the film would be a good idea?????Were they all on crack?What the heck were they thinking?I hope nobody ever makes another movie like this again.. it is actually really painful to watch this movie, it hurts your eyes and gives you a headache.Don't even rent this."
1,Utter garbage!,"I was shocked at how BAD this movie was. Right from the get-go, when they decided to use rap music for the opening theme music, I knew this was going to be a disaster -- and it was. Creative license is one thing. But producing a piece of junk like this and slapping the James Bond name on it is inexcusable. None of the slick polish -- no class, no fun, stupid STUPID plot -- just bad bad bad! Don't waste your money. If you really need to see it, then rent it."
5,A great bond film . Not to be missed!,"All I can say is , don't read my review, just buy the DVD , you'll be pleased!!"
1,Quantum of Solace,"Wasn't able to run this on my DVD. It keep rejecting it, stating a ""disc error"". i e-mail the person whom i purchased this product from, but they did not respond. I wanted to return this and either get a refund and/or another copy. Won't trust buying from individual not affiliated with any company again."
2,way too moronic to be watchable,"One does not expect a lot from a Bond movie, however, the multifaceted idiocy of this one is way beyond the pale.Just a tiny smallish example: waitresses in the third world military run hotels are not surprised when generals order them into their beds.The pictures are pretty though."
3,movie quality,This movie is good if you like the james bond series. but this movie I was not impressed.
4,James Bond,I like the Bond movies and this one is more the middle of the road in thinking overall about James Bond movies
1,Worst Bond Ever,"I would rate it as the worst Bond ever for at least two reasons. The first one for me was the opening title theme which is suppose to set the tone for the rest of the film. It was harsh, discordant, and unmelodic. Most Bond themes I remember would either become hit songs in their own right, or at least warrant airplay time as stand-alone pieces of worthwhile music. The theme for ""Quantum of Solace"" seems to be famous just for who performs it and not for any intrinsic value to the composition. In other words, It Sucks. The second reason is that the Bond humor is gone, and the plot is weak. I had no feelings at all for the characters and no desire to spend one hour and a half with them, and especially no feeling of danger from the bad guy, he didn't seem threatening; just annoying, and what is that with the exploding hotel? I would guess that this film may be just a stepping stone in Bond's further development and that a really good third movie with Daniel Craig is coming."
3,Not as good as Casino Royale,"If you were like me and you were surprised on how great Casino Royale was compared to the Typical cartoonish James Bond movies. You will be a bit dissapointed in Quantum of Solace.WHile this movie tried to leave off exactly where Casino Royale ended it did not have the tone or feel with this follow up. I was hoping for something that would continue with the 5 star Epic that was Casio Royale.I was left wanting. You never really knew who was who in this film. Character development was really lacking. Directing was all over the place. I feel bad, they really could have hit this film out of the park. Daniel Craig was spectacular in Casino Royale. This film is felt like he mailed it in. Total Auto Pilot. 3 Stars. Only because it actually tried to wrap up the story from the Previous film."
1,Worst Bond movie ever,"Daniel Craig lookinf so bored and disgusted playing his role should tell us right away what a bad movie this was going to be. It's so bad that it makes the previous dismal effort ""Casino Royale"" look like a gem. This one is not even worth a rental. Don't bother."
1,Painful to watch,"Constant flashing and shaky cam was used to create the illusion of action. In truth, movie is boring, and plot and acting stinks. [...] I will avoid all future James Bonds with Daniel Craig and movies directed by Marc Forster."
1,James Bond is so OVER,"Don't ask me what this movie was about, b/c I have no clue. The plot made no sense and everyone's thick accents made the dialogue hard to follow. The usual chase scenes.....zzzzzzz..nothing new here.If you want to watch some James Bond, check out the older ones with Sean Connery instead."
2,James Bond finally died,"When I say James Bond, whats one thing that come up in mind? gadgets,tricks, spy stuff..etc.. where was that in this movie? this movie was boring. I really wanted to be enjoy this movie and to make me watch it over and over again... instead it delivered a love story and a hide and go seek plot.!"
2,"No idea what this was, but it sure wasn't a James Bond movie","The title of my review pretty much sums it up. Aside from being convoluted, plodding, and confusing unless you watched the previous movie 5 minutes ago, it's missing all the trappings of what makes James Bond, well, James Bond.No gadets, no Q, no Moneypenny, etc.There have been James Bond movies before that I didn't love, but this is the first one I hated.If you haven't seen the previous film, check it out - it's pretty terrific. No idea what happened, but they really blew this sequel."
2,big drop off,"I am a fan of the 007 series. This movie however is a big drop off from the quality of Casino Royale. I really liked Craig in his first Bond role. I wanted to like this movie and was excited to see it, but sadly it was disappointing. I understood after seeing it why it was getting such bad reviews across the board. Just too boring for me, lacking cool 007 gadgets. Hopefully, the next one will improve."
2,"You only got one shot, make it count","This is the worst Bond film I've ever seen. That said, the institution of such brings high expectations. Opening with an incredibly weak action sequence, the film segués from one action scene to the next with dialogue and context jammed awkwardly between. The pace was rushed. The chemistry between characters was pushed or simply not given time to develop in intimate scenes. Such sandwiching of detail resulted in the constant spewing of information in dialogue. Conversations didn't seem natural they were so laden with detail needed to advance the plot. Even Bond's trademark steamy sex scene was cropped of sensuality or intrigue. The witty humor of Bond, himself, was absent. The soundtrack was one of the few consistent points of interest. Had this film been stripped of the franchise and made under a different context it could have stood with some touch-up. As a Bond film it was awful."
3,plot left some to be desired...,"I dont really care about what they were trying to save, so that hurt the movie for me."
3,What happened???,"I have always waited for the next Bond film. I have them all in DVD. But I am hestitant for the next one (if the series doesn't sink with MGM) if it has the same director. I would have given this 5 stars but for the cinematogaphy. This is a great story, but the use of >.5 sec per action shots had me asking myself, ""What just happened?"". You could actually miss things if you blink at the wrong time. I got to the point that I actually looked away during the action scenes because of the rapidity between shots. I couldn't keep up with them. In dvd, I am able to fast forward through those scenes.This was a good story, and great to end the last movie and start this one like they did. Just need to slow it down."
3,Action seemed forced.,"Action was jerky and did not flow well. It really seemed pieced together much like a movie is actually shot. Script did not flow well either. Scenes to short,and to many changes. Hard to follow storyline and hard to keep track of the characters. Casino Royale was much better. A slower pace but with action that would pull you in and end with a spectacular finish."
2,Lame Entry to the Series,"This may be the worst Bond Movie since the Lazenby fiasco. Lame story, under-funded production that is worth watching only for continuity."
2,too much special effects too little story,Bring back James Bond. I miss the story. I miss the humor. I miss the intrigue. I miss the visual bling. If you see a building blow up in a desert then this is the movie for you.
2,Hyper-edited action scenes. Very light on story line.,"I have to say, I was quite disappointed by Bond's showing on this one. The action scenes were edited so much that it was hard to follow, and the cuts between shots were extremely quick. I don't know what were they thinking. Also, the story line is paper thin. A friend told me that this film was written during the Writers Strike of 2007, and that explains a lot..."
2,Easily one of the worst Bond movies ever made,"After the glory that was Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace provided a shockingly sub-par performance for Craig & his producers."
2,Probably the worst Bond movie we've seen,"Some of the low lights:-Too much bouncing between countries.-Too hard to understand what they're saying (we finally ended up turning on the closed captioning)-Poorly defined villain (wow; he wants to dam up the water and create a scarcity. Not exactly the hard nose cliff hanger type of ""No, Mr. Bond. I expect you to die"" villain of years past).-No one really to route for/against - everyone could have been blown up and it wouldn't have mattered."
3,Doesn't measure up,"It's not Daniel Craig's fault. His acting is still great. It's the rather incomprehensible script that does this latest James Bond in. For sure, there are the usual cast of suspects, and as usual, Bond saves the day, gets several girls and lives to kill again another day. I couldn't really follow what was going on, though. Maybe it didn't matter. I got the gist. The formula has never varied."
4,I like it.,I wanted to catch up on this before I saw Skyfall. This was a great movie and was nice to watch before going to see Skyfall.
4,Enjoyable Movie,I have watched this movie two to three times since it was first released. I have enjoyed it each time. I watch for sheer enjoyment and nothing else. Too old.
2,Where's the story?,"I will be the first to admit that I'm not much of a Bond fan. I've never read one of Ian Fleming's books and this is only about the 4th Bond film I've watched. Unfortunately, Quantum of Solice reminded me why.I could only make it through about an hour of the movie. The non-stop violence got old very quickly. I saw Casino Royale, Mr. Craig's first Bond outing, and enjoyed it thoroughly. I'm not sure if it was because I thought Mr. Craig was a better Bond or what--but it certainly had more story. Quantum had minimal storyline used, solely it would appear, as a means of stringing together multiple chase scenes and shootings. With testosterone overflow, they were going for the lowest common denominator with this one. And there's certainly an audience for such...To give credit where it's due, however, the scenery was lovely. :-)"
1,Two hours of my life - that I'll never get back....,"Without doubt the worst Bond film of all time. ASTONISHINGLY bad. Unbelievable action sequences - LITERALLY ""unbelievable"", with a twisted plot that defies explanation. Please do not waste your money on this. If you feel that you MUST see it, get it on Netflix or something so that you won't have wasted your money as well as your time.If there were a way to rank it even lower than ""1 star"", I would."
1,not what i thought i was purchasing,I thought i was purchasing an actual dvd... was purcahsing as a gift... tried to cancel no where would it let me.very disappointed
1,quality was poor,The quality of this video was so poor. Was not watchable. I have 10mbs internet service still quality is bad. I was just waste of my money!
3,quantum,"I liked the film, although I don't like the person who plays Bond as well as previous actors, and I would prefer a man playing ""M""."
3,Bond's Second Mission!!!,"I thought this was pretty good. It had a lot of good action sequences. This one continues after the original and having James Bond going rogue and avenging Vesper's death and finding the bad guy. There were a couple of boring parts, but other than that, it's a pretty good Bond film. If you love the James Bond series, you'll love QUANTUM OF SOLACE!!!"
1,Not original product.,Awful product! I received a non original Blu Ray Box with a cover color copy!I doubt if the disc was original or a copy!I do not recoment this distributor!
2,Great production of a lousy script,"The film is overpaced, to kinetic and without a worthy storyline. How long can James Bond continue to the be the rogue agent until some one uses their 00 license on him? Yes, I got the message in the previous and much superior Casino Royale. The bad guys are boring, there are no good gadgets, and the plot is ::yawn:: boring. Think of this sophomore outing as comparable to the Matrix 2 for letting the fans down."
2,Only Craig rises above film's pedestrian script and cinematography,"Unfortunately, even the superb acting talents of Daniel Craig can't save Quantum of Solace from a pedestrian script and a flash editing style that makes the action scenes incomprehensibly difficult to follow most of the time. While flash editing has been used effectively before many times, it usually isn't combined with fast moving and deliberately over-shaky hand held camera work, and for good reason. Rather than impress, the action scenes in Quantum of Solace simply disorient the viewer. I found myself fast forwarding through the action scenes, the first time I've ever done that in a James Bond film. Rent it once to watch Craig's performance. Buy it only if it's important for you to have a complete set of Bond films."
4,whole lot not to dislike,"Daniel Craig as James Bond, there's not really a whole lot that you get to dislike. I really don't know about the title though, ""Quantum of Solace"" sounds really just rather, er, stupid. Fortunately, the movie isn't."
4,Great Addition to the Bond Catalogue,"While it may not be up to that usual Bond standards, Quantum of Solace is a very entertaining action flick. Perhaps a lot of people were turned off by a Bond sequel, but I personally liked seeing a continuation of Casino Royale. Craig is, again, terrific as Bond, portraying the character with a newfound sense of revenge and hostility."
1,He is so phony,Didn't care for it like the rest of his movies. A man only out to make a name for himself I find it hard to swallow people actually believe his bull. I can't think of any changes that came about from his b movies except maybe the million dollar log cabin he built for himself.
1,"Sad, very sad","So this is what liberals are reduced to now? Showing free videos weeks before an election to try to sway votes? REMEMBER 2004!!!! LoL!!! I guess the desperation never stops!I guess this just proves how empty of a suit Obama really is and how scared the libs are about losing the election.I wonder what video editing Michael Moore did in this video? I know he edited that newspaper article in his last movie with a fake headline. Maybe he edited G. W. Bush in a Nazi uniform with his hurricane making machine!Sad, very sad that people consider him a ""true"" documentary film maker. However, he is a brilliant capitalist, he found a fringe group that he can cater to and make money off of.God Bless the U.S.A."
1,"Wow, this is terrible","I am not sure how anyone can stomach this. If you hate America, this might be the movie for you."
2,No closed caption,I saw this free online and it was worth watching but I won't buy it because it has no closed caption. I have several good friends who are deaf or hard of hearing so I notice stuff like that.
2,Goofball,Funny movie of goofball Moore's failed attempt to recreate his childhood dreams of leading a group like the Yippies...
1,Incredible waste of time,Another self serving piece of work from Michael Moore. I fear for the next generation. I wish I could get back the time spent watching this.
2,Mostly Uninteresting,"Michael Moore is a talented filmmaker capable of creating excellent documentaries (""Bowling For Columbine,"" ""Sicko"") but his latest work feels more like a sloppy collection of out-of-date footage, complete with several full-length musical performances that serve only as filler. I have no problem with Moore's political views (in fact I am a Democrat proudly voting for Obama), and I appreciate that this video was available as a free download via his website and through Tivo/Amazon, but time is money and this film just isn't worth the time it takes to watch it."
2,Uninspiring,"While I generally enjoy Michael Moore's documentaries, this one fails to deliver. Rather than an investigative journey into an issue, it's loaded with speeches that don't quite inspire. A focus on why youth don't vote, and the mechanisms that prevent/dissuade them from voting may have been more interesting than a lecture tour. It may have worked well for Al Gore's ""Inconvenient Truth"" or Kevin Smith's ""An Evening With..."" series, but it didn't quite work for Moore.Whether you agree with Moore or not, this film holds nothing new. It will do little to persuade any one person to change their positions on issues. Hopefully his next film will get back to those ideas and elements that made ""Rodger & Me,"" ""Bowling for Columbine,"" and ""Sicko"" such successes.I recommend seeing Al Franken's ""And God Spoke..."" instead of this film."
1,Poor Amber!,I not sure what to say about this movie but dont bother. The only reason I did see it was for Amber Benson. She must have done it to fund one of her own movies. Anyways the movie it about these two couple who go to the caves of Mexico to score some pot to sale. Well the caves are haunted by really stupid ghosts. They begin to kill them off one by one they must some how escape this cursed cave. There not much here for as a story line and the gore is just to cheesy. I will give it this at least they hired actors who can act but it really was not a origanal story or one worth watching. Thats why I say poor Amber because she is great actress in Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Even if your a fan of hers it does not help this film not to mention they kill her off really early in the movie. Maybe she wanted it that way.
2,A forgettable movie...,"I had expected the film to be interesting, but this one failed in the emotion department. Don't expect to really feel anything. The film centers around two couples, who decide to go into a cavern along the Mexico to buy drugs. Little do they know that the caverns are hanted by ghosts, that are murdering people.If it hadn't for Amber Benson, I wouldn't have known or much less care about the film. Her acting in Buffy made me curious to see this. Well. It wasn't a hit."
2,Intermedio ( The Inbetween ),"So-So movie. I bought this movie because first, it looked interesting and secondly, I got the DVD at a good price. One of the reasons I wanted to see this film is because Steve Railsback ( Ed Gein ) stars in it. I think he's a great actor! In short, this is a movie that takes place in the caves of Mexico where the dead become alive...... evil dead. Four friends decide to take an expedition into the caves. They find the caverns a underground graveyard full of tortured ghosts who want them to be their prey. Some good moments, some not so good, some boring parts, but overall not a terrible movie. I just wish that Steve Railsback had a bigger starring role in this film. A little gore adds to the 2 star rating. A movie I'd suggest just renting before buying."
1,AWFUL!,The entire film consists of two teenagers running around in cave tuunels and screaming about being chased.
3,COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER,friends trapped in the caves along the mexican border face a terrifying evil that lies within. creepy!DVD includes cast and crew commentary.
5,2 boys and it's a hit!,"Zackaree just got this for his 4th birthday and I have to say, it's a toss up between him and his 20 month old brother as to which likes it more. Noah, within 5 minutes had totally mastered all the sounds and was in train heaven! This is a toy that will be a hit in any house, no matter how big the kid is!"
5,Another great addition to our track.,"To echo another reviewer, I too must have missed that the top of the mountain is intended to be a roadway. At first I was disappointed, but I converted it to a train track by simply adding track to it...duh. So as it does make CAR/TRUCK noises, I'm still more pleased with it as a TRAIN track, as is my son!This mountain overpass is our only sights and sounds Thomas toy as our intention was for Thomas to be a creative manipulative set, for now. I must say that it's noise, all be it loud, is the draw to the mountain. My son LOVES the 6 noises and will run his trains over or through this mountain continuously!I'm pleased with this addition and all the creative options it allows."
4,Fun addition to Thomas sets,"We bought the entire Mountain overpass set (which you can find for about $50 if you look around). We found that the road part was not very fun, but the tunnel is great. My toddler loves the noises that the trains make when they pass under or over the tunnel, and the little red button that she can push to make the noise on her own.We've incorporated the tunnel into several different layouts. I'd recommend it highly. But be warned, the noises are loud."
1,"Great for push cars, but no good for battery powered","The battery powered trains slip and slide going up the ramps. Very disappointing. I switched the ramps for my son with Brio track and the trains do a bit better. Have to set an incline with normal straight track going into the ramp for it to work.Other than that is is well built, but a bit too loud."
3,Doesn't hold up,"We purchased this playmat for our 18-month-old son for Chirstmas because we felt he was too young to spend so much money on the train table. The first mistake was assuming that the mat was the same size as the table. The mat is not designed for use with the tracks. This means that the figure eight set is too long and extends past the edge of the mat, making the tracks uneven. The biggest problem, however, if your child sits on the mat or crawls across it while playing, the felt top comes unglued from the rubber backing. This makes the felt top really wrinkle up so that his trains do not run smoothly across it. I tried to smooth it out, but it seems to have warped and will not smooth out. So far, this doesn't seem to have bothered our son too much, though. He continues to play with it, although he does prefer to use his train table that his grandfather made for him to put his tracks on. Much cheaper than a [...] train table!"
4,Thomas playmat,I bought this for my son's extensive Wooden railway system. It is great for traveling to see our family. He then uses the mat on the floor to set up his train set. He also just uses the map to play with his trains. Our son is two and I think we will get a lot of use out of it. when he grows out of it I will use it as a door mat in the muddroom!
3,"Okay but other options, consdier your child","The mat is okay, but it will likley not replace you child's desire for the track systems. It does however provide a nice surface to not scratch up table/floor with trains and other toys. My son does seem to like it, but if I had to do over again would have gotten him a large piece of felt and more track."
5,Great product at a great price!,This is the seat meant for the separate adjustable piano bench frame. The idea is that you can color mix and match the frame and the seat cushion. Works great and very sturdy. Can't beat the price!The other reviewer should have used her brain -- any type of direct contact with metal staples is going to scratch a wooden bench. It's her fault and not the fault of Amazon or Musician's Friends.
1,May not work on your PC,"Be careful to note that the drive comes formatted for Mac. It shouldn't be a problem to reformat it on your PC, but...it didn't show up on my computer after plugging in the usb no matter what I did. (I have a garden variety Dell running XP.) Some people seem to have this problem and others don't. I have another brand drive working fine, so it's not my machine. Roll the dice..."
4,LaCie d2 300 GB,"I've been buying LaCie products for my Macs for years. As usual, this one was well priced, effortless to put into service, and does what I bought it for: serve as a backup destination for two heavily used Mac laptop, mine and my wife's. Came with everything needed to put it to work, including Firewire and USB cables. (On a Mac that's all you need, no driver install required.)USB2.0 high-volume (40 GB) backups are about 15% slower than identical-sized Firewire 400 backups, which is typical results for a USB 2-equipped Mac."
1,LaCie drive quit working,"What a disappointment that what I thought was a reputable company makes such an unreliable product. After about a years time, my LaCie drive started clicking. And then, no data. It completely failed. I too made the mistake of trusting this drive and didn't back it up. I am sick about what I've lost. I've emailed LaCie about the failure and have not received a reply. Beware of LaCie external drives."
2,I was hoping for more,"I never did make the connection about the ""ship in the Army"" and it really wasn't all that funny. Oh well, I have seen worse."
5,wackest ship in the Army,"Very funny movie, I saw it when I was little and remembered how I liked it....Good for any War movie buff..."
5,The Wackiest Ship In The Army,This vhs tape was in excellent condtion. It arrived in just a couple of days of ordering and was very pleased with the condition the tape was in.
1,Great movie---Amazon download stinks,"I love the movie, but Amazon on Demand is awful! It keeps interrupting with ""unable to find"", etc. I have tried without success to download it to watch...that was going to take 16 hours over a DSL line. Amazon is great for books, but try netflix for movies!"
2,Disappointing Lemon,"Somehow, I (we) remembered this movie differently from what we just saw and sadly, were dissapointed with the plot (if any), dialogue and the acting."
4,Wrong Movie,"This isn't a bad movie, but what I had rather see is a compilation of the seasons that ""Wackiest Ship in the Army"" was on TV. The TV show was, all told, much superior to this movie. The missions they were sent on and the dangers that they faced were exciting, and at the same time done with much humor. I'm not knocking this movie at all, but I would prefer to see the several seasons of the TV show on DVD. McHale's Navy it definitely wasn't."
3,Doesn't quite decide what it wants to be...,"While I enjoyed parts of this show, it never really came together for me. There were parts that were almost funny, parts that were almost dramatic, and parts that were almost adventurous.Jack Lenmmons performance in this show doesn't touch his work in ""Mister Roberts"" or many of his other movies.If you like adventures and misadventures set in a wartime setting, you may like this one."
4,The Wackiest Ship in The Army,"This is classic Jack Lemmon work. He delivers that same comedic performance that has made him such a treasured actor in so many of his other films, such as The Apartment, The Odd Couple, and Grumpy Old Men. And Rick Nelson is at his very handsomest, and makes a great straight man for Jack. It's just such a feel good movie that doesn't require a great deal of concentration to enjoy. Loved it!"
4,Just good fun,"I remember first seeing this movie in a drive in with my family. Back then, drive ins were a special treat and I can't forget how blue the pacific waters appeared. Nostalgia aside, this film has Jack Lemmon, what else needs to be said."
3,SLOW,"I ordered 5 movies from different supplers at the same time. I received all within 7 days except for this supplier; they took the whole 30 days. Don't know what happened from the time they said they shipped it and the time I received it, but it was slow getting here."
3,A Little Weak but Enjoyable for the Whole Family,"I had never seen this show before, and bought it solely after reading the Amazon recommendations. It is just as advertised, but I would say that the recommendations were a bit strong for such a simple, straightforward, G-Rated, Wholesome Family movie."
4,Wackiest,"Jack Lemmon and Rick Nelson are both entertaining in this honest presentation. It's a comedy, but not over the top the way theyseem to make them today i.e. for the laughs with either slapstick or ridiculous verbal set ups. The widescreen print is very good. C6"
4,Spider-Man & The X-Men Team Up!,"Taken from the popular animated series from the 90's, Spider-Man is in search of a way to either control or cure a condition caused by his own powers that is mutating him. He comes across Charlex Xaiver and his X-Men (its the X-team from the equally popular 90's series featuring Cyclops, Jean Grey, Wolverine, The Beast, Storm, Gambit, Rogue and Jubilee) and after a rough start, he finds that they can't help him but Beast points him to a Dr. Herbert Landon who supposedly can help his condition. What comes next is a fight between Spider-Man Vs. Wolverine (shades of their one on one fight in the famous Spider-Man Vs. Wolverine comic from the late 80's), an appearance from the Hobgoblin and the true nature of Dr. Landon's ""cure.""One of the best episodes from the series! I only wish they would go ahead and put them on series sets for DVD! Worth getting if you can find it!"
2,Is this really Saliva????,"As a proud owner of all Saliva's past work, I was very excited to purchase the newest release yesterday. As the album began, I was pleased with the opening track and eagerly anticipated more, gritty Southern rock. However, much to my dismay, instead I received dose after painful dose of soft, poppy, hook ladden top 40/American Idol-esque songs. With the exception of one track near the end, the rest of the CD belongs in the ""easy listening"" section, not rock/metal. Although I must admit, some of the chorus lines are a bit catchy, I was hoping for another CD to blast at the gym, not fall asleep to. This disc now belongs to my girlfriend, stocked away next to her Chris Daughtry, Kelly Clarkson and Kelly Pickler CD's... Very disappointed."
4,Saliva - Blood Stained Love Story,"Somewhere between Nickelback and Linkin Park, you'll find the band Saliva and their fifth studio effort Blood Stained Love Story. Save for the somewhat overdone Ladies and Gentlemen, BSLS is cut for cut a solid record. Old-school fans of Saliva may be put off by the lack of heaviness, but those who looked away after 2003's Survival Of The Sickest are invited back instantly via accessible, matured song writing. At under 40 minutes in length, BSLS has no room for filler, and thankfully, there isn't any (although as mentioned earlier, Ladies and Gentlemen may take some time to grow on you). Fans of Alternative Metal, Nu-Metal and Medium Heavy Rock will more than likely enjoy Blood Stained Love Story."
3,Too slow...,"I was really anticipating this c/d. I have the rest of Saliva's c/d's and this one was pretty dissappointing. First of all, there are only 10 songs. (12 if you get the Best Buy release, but the 2 extra songs are so bad I wish they hadn't bothered) Saliva made themselves big by writing catchy, high-adrenaline, fun songs. This c/d lacks that in all but 3 tracks. I'm not opposed to slower songs (Back into Your System is my favorite Saliva c/d and its slower than their other releases) but if I wanted a c/d with nothing but slow stuff, I'd get a crappy Dashboard c/d or something.Overall, the it isn't a horrible c/d, its just not what someone would expect from Saliva. The technial work on the guitar has improved and there a several awesome solos on the c/d. Josey does well vocally on most of the songs. The best song is Black Sheep. Other good ones are Ladies and Gentleman, Broken Sunday, and One More Chance. I'd still recommend it for Saliva fans, just be warned that its no Every Six Seconds."
2,Weak,"Bought the cd today and feel like i wasted money not as good as the other cd's, weak is a good word for the cd."
4,Saliva is back with a decent album,"Two and a half years since thier last album (and worst) the boys from Memphis are back with a decent album. Better than their ""Survival of the Sickest"" (3 stars) but not as good as ""Every 6 Seconds"" or ""Back into Your System"" (both 4.5 stars). The main reason, to me anyway, is the growing amount of slower songs the groups puts out. Shorter than their other albums with only 10 songs, 1 is almost a classic, 1 I skip, 5 are good and the other 3 are ok. While it's a decent album and a good one for their fans, I prefer their earlier work more.#1 - 8.5 (a nice upbeat track, not much lyrics though)#2 - 8.5#3 - 8#4 - 9.5 (my favorite and another upbeat one)#5 - 8#6 - 7#7 - 5#8 - 7#9 - 7.5#10 - 7check all my reviews"
1,Is It 2001 Again?,"Oh wait, it's just Saliva. Like this band was original anyways. Just take ""Every Six Seconds"" and mix it in with ""Back Into Your System"" and you have this. Just another generic radio rock disc. If you dig other atrocious a$$rock artists like Puddle of Theory of a Nickeldefaultcreed, you'll eat this up. Me? Just give meOrigin & Informis Infinitas Inhumani."
1,Saliva = Sell out,What an awful album. Thank goodness I listened to tracks online before I went out and bought this junk.
2,One hit wonders,"Its sad how after they had one hit ""Click, Click Boom"" that was featured on every single soundtrack known to man, that they would make an entire album and have every song sounding almost exactly like that one hit. And if it didn't sound like it they were sure to mention it somewhere in the song. I don't know though, there were one or two songs that were decent but I wasn't crazy about this album."
2,"Hey, who took the Rock away? Buy Fozzy if you want a great CD","This appears to be the Saliva 'Ballads' Cd....the band from the first couple CD's is long gone, and a pop band with a ton of slow ballads has taken their place. Great band in concert, but this doesn't represent the band at all. Check out the new Fozzy All that Remains Reloaded CD if you want to hear an incredible rock/metal CD with ZERO ballads"
3,just cant get over the hump...,"i've liked Saliva since 2000. unfortunately, with every new release they just seem to tread water. this is a good record...nothing more, nothing less. Broken Sunday is a great song and should be a hit but they definitely went a little soft with the rest of the album."
2,This is awful main stream garbage!!!!,"I really have liked Saliva's CDs especially Back Into Your System, and Survival of the Sickest. Both of those CDs were great and very enjoyable. So I was super excited to hear this!!! I thought the single (Ladies and Gentlemen) was pretty good, and I felt Saliva would come out with another great CD. Sadly this is not that great CD. This is just main stream garbage!! This is not Saliva!! I mean there are a couple of good songs (Ladies and Gentlemen, King of the Stereo, and Black Sheep), but even those sound like b-sides from other Saliva CDs. Sadly this is just not very good at all, in fact to be frank its awful!! By far the worst Saliva CD!!! Don't buy it if your a Saliva fan, only buy it if you like Britney Spears and junk like that!! I would have given this 1 star, but like I said a couple songs are good, and I just feel bad giving a great band (up to this point) 1 star on any of their CDs."
2,Nickelback Ripoff,"Tell me no one else has noticed the similarities between Animals by Nickelback and Black Sheep on this album? It seems to me Saliva slowed it down to try to get people not to notice it. Besides this,the album is mediocre compared to their others. Ladies and Gentlemen definately rocked, the res is OK."
2,2 stars since only 2 songs are Saliva,"When I heard Ladies and Gentlemen, I was excited. I thought here is going to be a great Saliva album. Instead what we have is another Daughtry CD. I loved the first Saliva album, the second had some bubble gum, but still some rockin songs. The third was raw and a bit immature, but still good. This album is pop. I thought Saliva of all bands wouldn't try to be Nickelback, but the Nickelback album at least rocked a little. I am very disappointed. If you want Click Click Boom and great rock anthems, listen to old Saliva, if Daughtry is your thing then this is for you. Me, I'll listen to Ladies and Gentlemen until I wear it out, then I'll move on."
1,Saliva has turned to SLOBBER,"This album is not the Saliva I know. I loved ""Survival of the Sickest"", and this album is not like that at all, with the exception of tracks 1 and 8. The rest MUST have been someone else."
2,2 Stars for 2 songs,"I first listened to this CD while at the gym and I was pumped while listening to Ladies and Gentleman, then..............the wheels came off. What happened to these guys?? Other than track 1 and 5, this was dissapointing. And the Twister song?? I couldn't force myself to even finish listening to that song. As with all bands, maybe it's time to hang it up boys, you're definitely scratching the bottom of the barrel here. What a shame.Atleast your other CD's rocked. And I'm off to the bargain bin.............."
4,Tonka Truck,"I got this for my one year old and he enjoys it. It seems to be very sturdy and well made. My only suggestions is that for kids just learning to walk, an adult will need to play with them with this toy. It's just to easy for them to push it and have it get away from them resulting in a crash on the floor.Otherwise the noises are fun and it's a good Tonka product."
1,Ouch!,"My grandson tries to play on this, and scoots across the floor on it, but rolls over his toes alot and it only goes in a straight line. So he is always lifting it up to turn. The space between front and back wheels is small, so when child scoots on it, he has to watch out for his toes constantly. My grandson sat on it and played with the ignition, horn and blinkers until just recently as it was too hard for him to operate. He is a normal 21 month size currently.The seat is hard to change from sit to push. And you can hurt your fingers doing it.Overall, I think this vehicle is cute and noises fun, but it just isn't too functional and a little damaging to toes and fingers."
2,It's not like a Tonka,This toy is cute and has the blocks to sort and all but it doesn't have turning wheels and therefore my son wouldn't even play with it. The steering wheel doesn't actually turn anything! I bought it for a present in August and I've already given it away. I was disappointed.
2,Okay,"This toy was okay.The sounds are VERY loud, so much so that the volume hurts our ears, we put packaging tape over the speakers to try to mute the noise to protect our son's ears. There is no way to turn off the sound except to remove batteries.The seat is difficult to lift up for an adult; pretty much impossible for a toddler.It would be nice if the truck came with 9-12 little blocks instead of only three. The storage under the seat would hold a lot more than 3. We've lost one so we're down to two."
3,Tonka Truck - It's Ok,My son got this for his 1st birthday. He doesn't play with it for very long and the sounds it makes just keep going and going and going. The seat is too wide for him to sit on comfortably.
5,Hasbro Tonka Ride-on Truck,I bought this Tonka Ride-on for my 10 month old grandson for Christmas. He loves it. He is now 15 months old and enjoys riding it and dragging it around. I also bought the Tonka Tow attachment which turns this truck into a tow truck. The attachment slides into the back of the seat and is easy to put on and remove.
4,Great versatile push/ride on toy!,"I purchased this for my 9 month old son and he loves it. He can only use it in push and ride on mode right now with supervision, but he loves to push it on the floor and put the shapes on top and in and out of the compartment. I can see him enjoying this for months to come!"
5,Tonka Drive and Scoot,I bought this for me cousin who is 18 months old and it was a hit at Christmas. This went along with the Tonka dump tuck and attaches at the back and made a great gift for around 20.00 for both. He was very happy. Parents were happy because this can go with him to about 3 years.
5,Cool,"My girls ages 3 and 2 love the dump truck. I thought I would have a little more variety and at theses age they love pushing stuff around. I could not beat the price either. The sounds are quite enjoyable too, I love amazon!"
5,SMG never disapoints,"I bought this CD a little while back and I cant say good enough things about it for the review, just be sure to check it out. ""Loser"" is a personal favorite of mine from the disc. Let your ears be treated by Sister Machine Gun's genre busting music now! Why are you still reading this? BUY IT NOW!"
2,"Relaxed, somewhat listless, live performance (Palomino)","Please don't confuse this with the excellent 1991 CD ""Rocking My Life Away"" (collection of the Elektra years). The performance is slow, and apparently unplanned: JLL takes requests from the drunken crowd whose voices are constantly in the background. The guitars have an 'up-front' sound which is okay, but the 12-string is out-of-tune! There is not much piano. JLL does ""Who is Going to Play This Old Piano"" - This is comical since he plays the whole album using an electronic keyboard! In summary, you might have enjoyed the concert if you had attended, but the recording leaves much to be desired."
2,The Paint Comes Off,"It says it's safe for the dishwasher, but I don't think it is and I only put it on the top shelf. After a few months of use the green paint blistered and flaked off, falling into the juice, which of course you will have to pick out IF you notice it."
1,Broke on first try,"Bought this item, got all excited to make some fresh margaritas. I squeezed one lime. Worked fine. Squeezed the second lime. Worked fine. Squeezed the third lime and it broke (see photos I posted).Returned to the store and got my money back. Guess I'll spend the money on a reputable brand (Oxo, Williams Sonoma, etc). This thing is junk."
3,for juice only - good,"if you want just juice, not pulp , nd are willing not to wring every last drop from the rind, this is fast and efficient."
2,Dull writing; trite characters; predictable plot,"As a Silicon Valley guy, I was hoping for a good fictionalized account of how the valley works. Unfortunately, all I got was a rather thinly veiled portrayal of the Sculley/Jobs battle, rather poorly written. I didn't feel anything for any of them, and didn't see much depth or humanity in them. Even CEO's and marketing guys deserve better than this!"
4,"We all know about...""The Deal""","Okay, Joe, here we go. I'm not going to say how I acquired this book. Other than I did purchase it. I selected the novel among a stack of other books. First time author for this type of fiction novel. Sure, I'm interested. Let's see how well he writes. But.. let's not kid ourselves. The author had a cast of characters, a plot and everything needed for this novel. It wasn't a bad thing either. I read the book from start to finish and from what I can tell, Hutsko has the makings of a fine author. It's obvious he's living in the age of computers and fast living. My advice at this time to the observer of this review...go ahead and read Hutsko's novel, see what you think. I liked it. My advice to Joe Hutsko.... ""you go, Joe."" ;-)"
3,"Entertaining at times, but pretty hackneyed overall.","I wanted very much to like this book, as I'm intimately familiar with the subject matter (handheld computers, technology, etc.). But the story is trite, contrived, and filled with rather silly twists. Even worse, one feels no empathy for any of the characters, most of whom are two-dimensional at best. If you're looking for good ""Silicon Valley"" novels, check out ""Microserfs"" and ""The First $20 Million is Always the Hardest."""
4,"Entertaining, good read!","The new author, Joe Hutsko, has written a very good first book. I would suspect he has a future in this business. The story line is that of 2 men who deal with thei abilities, demons and ambition.All of these human dilemmas focus around a computer company and the men and women who guide them. The love interests are nicely woven into the main plot and are central, not peripheral to it.All in all, an entertaining and well-written book."
5,"Excellent view from the inside! Makes me want a laptop, too.",I found this insider look at the soap-opera like actions of the corporate world to be an excellent read. I have often imagined it to be exactly as described and this only tends to confirm that thought!
1,"hypocrital, boring, meaningless","What an overhyped dog biscuit. Poor writing, mediocre storyline, and filled with the author's twisted personal views which are of very little value. You've been warned!"
1,ho-hum,It is 90 per-cent about his sex life (repetitious and boring) and 10 per-cent about his career (the interesting part). It should have been the other way around!
4,Moving and enlightening story... Kindle edition NEEDS spellchek,"I am finding the information, self-examination, lack of pretense and openness refreshing for a show biz bio. It's not catty or demeaning. Covers a lot of territory - broadway, movies, stars, producers, psychiatry, sexuality and its fluidity, homo- & hetero-sexuality, etc. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the arts in this country as well as the personal journey of discovery of one of our most creative and talented artists.The Kindle version needs a serious proof-reader and/or spell check. There are SO many words that just don't exist, e.g. p(ate -- which I think was supposed to be plate, given the context. Throughout there are these typos where [ is used instead of l. Mars the flow of the narrative but not its impact. Just makes me wonder about quality of what we're paying for."
5,"An excellent, involving coverage.","Arthur Laurents' Original Story is a winner: it provides a memoir of Broadway and Hollywood years by a director and playwright who considers his life, his work, and the world which fostered Hollywood after World War II. An excellent, involving coverage."
3,Just okay!,"Although Arthur Laurents has had a most incredible career and some very major successes, along with some duds, this book was dissapointing. I'm not certain if it's the tone and style of his writting (catty, bitchy, mean spirited, aloof, full of himself), or the constant rambling and seemingly non-direction of the story lines. This thing really bounced around a lot and it was hard to follow. In one paragraph he's talking about working on West Side Story, and then the next paragraph about having sex with some young hottie, and then he's onto remarks about Jerome Robbins and Gypsy. Huh? I think he's a better writer than this, and perhaps when he wrote it in his early 80's he just didn't care anymore. I was mostly bored, and little intrigued because of who he is and what he's accomplished, but I would not recommend this book unless you're a relative."
3,Kindle scrambled text,"I enjoyed reading Laurents' story, but there are flaws in the Kindle edition. Starting just before chapter 3 the text gets scrambled over about 7 pages. A sentence will just stop in the middle, and another section of the story will begin - pages later the original text picks up but then you have to keep flipping back and forth to read the story whole. The same thing happens again in chapter 4, but after that its clear sailing.Kindle edition looks very good on my DX, the pictures are effectively placed. Consult the other reviews to see if the material is for you. The flaws didn't slow me down for long and Laurents' style is so fragmented anyway that it isn't as jarring as it might be.Original Story By: A Memoir of Broadway and Hollywood"
3,Laurents should stick to writing scripts and screenplays.,"While Original Story By does contain a number of interesting anecdotes and some fascinating backstage information on a number of the shows and movies he was involved with, it remains ultimately inaccessible. Arthur Laurents writes in a very stream of conciousness style, which makes following the exact timeline of events and productions difficult. Also, because he is effectively covering his life more than his work, some of your specific questions about his work may be glossed over or ignored altogether. If you have interest in Arthur Laurents, you may want to skim this book for interesting information, but don't count on finding everything you're looking for."
3,Chemical Smell,"Yes, I've ordered two sets at different times and they both have a strong chemical smell. I've aired them outside for a couple of days to hopefully break down any harmful chemicals. As to sizing, my tennis shoes are size 7.5 M and I ordered the Women's 7-8 and did not have to trim the insoles to fit. I did remove the original insole from my Asics. This is a basic insole without extra arch support or even contouring, just a little extra cushioning."
2,Bad choice,"I do not recommend these insoles. After a month or so of use, the green fabric started wearing and I get an uncomfortable feel, just like if there is sand in the shoes.If you decide to buy them, make sure you order a larger size than your shoes. I ordered the same size and they turned out too short."
3,Not much better,The bottoms of my feet hurt after walking. My Physical Therapist recommended this product. I put the insoles in my shoes and did not notice much difference. Save your money.
3,gives a fairly good cushion,Good cushion. A bit better than Dr Scholls $2 shoe insole. 10 -11 size seems small on my 10 1/2 shoe.
5,Big improvement!,"I have a pair of casual shoes that I like to wear but noticed my feet hurt after a long day. Replaced the factory insoles with these and it made a big difference, walking and standing comfort both improved.These Spenco insoles, as well as others, hold up very well in even rough duty boots, much more so better than the gel kind you get at the drug store."
4,Comfy at a larger size,These run larger in size - my husband is a size 17 mens and these worked for him. You can trim them down with scissors so you can make them fit to your specific shoes.
5,Spenco Insoles Work Great,"I buy Spenco Rx Comfort Insoles to recover my Orthotics, I have been doing this for many years. They are the same material that the professionals use and they work great. I will continue to use them in the future as long as they are available."
5,Top notch,"I've been using these for over 2 years in my most frequently used walking shoes. Absolutely comfortable and long lasting. And it fits very well inside the shoe. And even better yet, when I take my feet out, these insoles don't fold up or come out. That would really bother me if it did."
2,they are ok!,"- These are ok for the price.I wouldn't personally buy them again as for another $10, you can get something MUCH MUCH better."
4,Ok but they tend to get smelly from perspiration,"I got several pairs of these to replace the molded insoles that came with shoes I bought which I found extremely uncomfortable. These do the job of cushioning for me much better than those formed insoles which have arch supports that are in the wrong place for my feet. But they do get smelly from perspiration, and the pair I had in my boots smelled the worst after a few wearings. I did wash the insoles and try a foot spray on them which helps a little to keep the odor down."
5,"Thin, soft and comfortable","I have been using these in my running shoes for years. They are thin, soft and they are very comfortable."
5,Excellent product--your feet will enjoy them!,I have worn these shoe inserts for the last 25 years since they were recommended to me by my dermotoligist. They make any shoe more comfortable and easier on your feet. I occasionaly replace them with newer ones but they can be washed and reused and have a long life. I have pairs in all of my shoes.
2,A Karate man dressed in a Ninja suit does not make a Ninja,Takayuki Kubota ia a name highly respected in Martial Art circles but this book is not to be highly respected. Obviously Sensei Kubota has tried to cash in on the Ninja craze of the 80s. The book is a very bland account of the use of the shuriken and the Ninja clad Kubota is presented to us (especially Ninjutsu practioners) as a bit of a joke. All throwing stances and grips are shown along with the 2 last meagre chapters on meditation. Ninja fans look for a book by a true Ninja master for guidance or more correctly take lessons. A poor buy!
3,Sperry review,Nice to have multiple closure options but some of the topical material came off with first washing.
1,Don't waste your money!,"Installing it took about 45 minutes, but the plastic piece that rides in the door track popped off where it was supposed to be bonded to metal slider. The metal slider screws through the window into an anchor like structure in the form of a circle . The original is a 2 piece design. This one is a 3 piece design. I should have bought an OEM piece. I hope this saves you the time I wasted. To fix it I had to epoxy the two pieces together."
2,Not worth the hassle of installing.,Product was a pain in the butt to install. I put this on a 4.9 Liter OHV cadillac motor. Had to cut & bend the brake booster tube just to get it to clear the egr valve then had the engine stuck at full throttle on startup. When I went to remove the spacer I discovered the threads pulled out of the block & were stuck on the steel mounting screws. On The plus side I did get to change out my leaky old tbi gasket! Thanks transdapt.
4,Simple mystery but complex personal interactions,"The crime in this book is the classic murder in a room locked and bolted from the inside. The difference was that the room was the oval office of the White House. However, once it was noted that the locks in the room were old and unsophisticated, the solution to that problem was obvious. Like the other stories in this series, the most interesting aspects are the presence of other historical figures. J. Edgar Hoover and Clyde Tolson get slapped down by a crooked banker and there are cameo appearances by a junior officer named Dwight Eisenhower and a rising politician named Lyndon Johnson.My greatest enjoyment from the book was engaging in idle speculation regarding the historical accuracy of the actions of the people other than the Roosevelts. It is quite possible that some of the events have a bit of historical accuracy. The mystery is ordinary and I solved it rather quickly. However, the other events kept me interested and I enjoyed the book anyway."
5,Great Expansion Set,My older son enjoyed his Thomas set for many years. He still has it boxed away saving it for his children. I'm sure my Grandson will enjoy his set too.
5,Thomas & Friends Track Survey,What a fun track to add to our collection! Very easier for my youngest child to play with and there is quite a bit of track that came with the set.
5,Great for all ages,I got this for my 3.5 yr old son. We had the basic set and wanted to expend. This is just great! It adds a lot of interest to the game since it adds layers and my son loves to have two trains on the bridge at the same time.
4,fits pretty well,"We buy Ikea track usually - it's cheaper and works with the Thomas trains perfectly.The Thomas tracks fit snugly with Ikea's - a little difficult for the 2y/o but not too hard for parents to connect. The height-difference is a bit of a gap with the Ikea bridges (but not enough to disrupt train-play). The Ikea supports need to be flipped upside-down to work with the height of the Thomas track - simple enough but makes them slightly more shifty (but not a real issue). Overall, I like that we can buy the inexpensive track and still use it with great success when combining with the more complicated Thomas expansions."
3,Not practical for the train table,"We found that this set when put together as a double decker like it is meant to be, is just too long for our train table. Luckily the stacking risers can be taken apart to make two seperate hills but that is not what we were hoping for.However, good quality as usual."
3,Not impressed,"After owning the 5-in-1 track which has given us so much fun, I thought adding this set would only make it better. Well, yes and no. the set makes a 3D style train tracks but the supporting pieces are too limited. Having only 2 supporting piece, you are almost limited to just making the 1 layout without buying more pieces. Also because it was elevated it takes a longer length to come down to the ground so it takes up more space on the train table. All in all, it added a little fun but not much, for the price we paid."
1,Don't Bother,"I read extensively in a number of fiction categories, including many romance subgenres. This was one of the very few books in any field that I was not able to get past the first 30 pages. The male character kept thinking and speaking about himself in the third person, which makes for very stilted reading (nobody goes with the flow in this one).I am a devoted fan of series, and was extremely disappointed not to have found an interesting new one to follow."
1,A Total Disappointment,"Do not buy this game. For ages 7 and younger it is simple and easy to use and would be fine to start off a youngster with horsey computer games, but overall it is repetitive and boring. If you really want a good horse game buy Saddle Up Time to Ride, Saddle Up with Pippa Funnell, All the Let's Ride! games are great, though I thought that the Let's Ride! Corral Club was more childish than the others. A good deal is the Let's Ride! Champions Collection which has 3 horse games. 2 of them being really good: Mary King's Riding Star, and Equestriad 2001."
2,It was ok,"i am a horse freak and i most likely have all the games and i have to say that this game was very disappointing. The graphics were ok but there is really no point to the game and all you end up doing really is just racing and some more raceing theres not really a challege at all. If i really new how this game was going to be i would have never bought it. I played it like what ummm.....6 times and then i was done with it. So no i do not recommanded this game to someone who is looking for more than just, racing. This game has NO POINT!!!!!!"
1,"One word, yuck!","Seeing a horse on the box, I bought this game right away. I got it home and it took FOREVER to load. Then I started to play, and I was VERY unhappy! The game takes FOREVER to get from one screen to another! And you don't even steer your horse! All you do Is pick a place to go (the graphics are not good) and then after it loads, which takes forever, all you get to do is run in a straght line and press spacebar when needed.NO NOT BUY THIS CRUDDY GAME!!The only thing I can se good about this game is that if you got it for a little kid it would be easy to jump. But then you would have to put up with ""Mommy! Is it done loading!?"""
2,Dissappointing,"This was very dissapointing. It takes a long long long long long LONG time to load. Horses look very ugly and so do riders, saddles, all you do Is race. So BORING!! Please, If you want to save your money and your time, don't buy this game."
3,I think it is ok,I got the game for Christmas and I found it enjoyable.All you do is jump. I thought you would do more.
2,Very bad,"In this game, all you do is press space bar to start and jump.No joke. The horses look like mules. The graphics are pkay. I highly recomend let's ride games. The graphics are great. In championship collectuion, you can feed, ride, and pet your horse."
1,Okay if you're not into storylines or taking care of horses,"This game takes a long time to load each terrain. The gameplay is from a 3rd person perspective with horses running from the left to the right side of the screen. You have several horses with different strengths to choose from, choose wisely based on the terrain. It's not a bad game. There is no horse care or story line, just jumping. For me, it's boring and slow and unrealistic and I wish I hadn't bought it."
3,The Ronettes before Phil Spector,"The tracks on this CD cover the period in the early 60s when the Ronettes were trying to establish themselves as a pop group.You can see here that the girls,Ronnie Bennet,her sister,Estelle, and cousin,Nedra Talley,were feeling their way towards what they might and could be.But this is not the big surround sound that Ronettes fans might be harking back to.The wall of sound that they are now associated with was still ink in the pen of Phil Spector.Several years in the future,Phil was able to take the best of what the Ronettes already had and put his own stamp on it.Nevertheless,if you like these girls -and they were very charismatic -and you want to hear how they first started to project themselves into our musical hearts,then this is a worthwhile purchase.It's proto-Ronettes,neo-Ronettes.And they sing with a lot of power and magnetism.This CD captures that early drive and that attractive sound that went into the great girl groups of the 60s."
1,Unreadable,"Because of intractable notation (presumably introduced in another Karatzas-Schreve book) and careless exposition (author is completely free of thinking about reader) where proofs are absent, sketchy, or simply thrown at the reader with a shovel, one needs an hour per line (of text) to read this disorganized book. Add here pretension of applied science - this material is completely absent of application (ask any options manager has he ever heard about Karatzas!) and you have a book which only application will be as a shelf weight."
1,12 oz clear cups,i ordered 12 oz clear cups. these are transparent cups i could get anywhere. it is not what i ordered. it is not the cup in the picture.
4,Ace it Nt Server in the enterprise,"I thought this book was very well written, just like the other aceit books. I used this book alone and passed with flying colors."
5,The World Stormrider Guide Volume 1,"This and all the Stormrider Guides are truely great sources of information about surf travel. Cleverly put together, have beautiful illustrations, and are packed with all the necessary information you need to start planning your surf adventure and travel. Every surfer (young or old) should have all of them on the shelves of their personal library. Go ahead and invest. You'll be stoked, dude!Cowabunga, nos vemos en el agua!"
5,The book is awesome.. but....,The book is awesome.. but.... the back cover is almost detaching fom the book.....
2,Los dias enmascarados,Carlos Fuentes is a great author but some of his stories are too complicated for me. Out of the 6 short stories I only liked 3 the best is Chacmol.
3,very nice shoe,i only gave 3 stars because the shoe doesnt come in half sizes. very nice shoe but wish they came in halves.
3,Not good enough as a guide.,"I bought this book at Barnes and Noble and must say that I liked the layout and that it is easy to read. It has a lot of information in it, although I would have liked to have more referrals to other sources of information as well. This book gives you a great bit of motivation to finally stop thinking about an own business but doing it. I would recommend it to everyone who hasn't yet decided if or if not. Other than that it is not meant to be your guideline to opening your own restaurant since it doesn't give you enough information.Pros: Easy to read, gives motivation, examples to determine costs, tips and hints to help you out, very well structured.Cons: Doesn't give enough information on each chapter, doesn't refer enough to other information sources.It still has been nice to read this book and very interesting."
2,"""Everything"" is a bit of an exaggeration","This book is okay as an introduction, but overall it's pretty light. This is probably a case of ""you get what you pay for."" Save the $10 and put it towards one of the more comprehensive guideson this topic."
4,Good Product,"This shooting mat/rifle drag bag is well made and after using it for a few range sessions, I am very pleased. Seller came through with shipping as promised, and the price was very competitive with other outlets for the same product."
4,very good for the price,"material is heavy and water proof, stitching is weak in some areas. Zipper is good, but does not operatd without catching on inner material. All straps are tough and operate well. Overall, this is a very good bag/mat for the money."
5,A terrific read on post world war II Ireland,"Written by my uncle, this 20 year-old novel is still a joy to read. It is the coming-of-age story of the protagonist in a time of war in Europe. The back drop of Dublin, the ""Troubles"" so recent in the author's memory, and the palpable warmth of the surrounding country-side puts you in touch with Ireland as it was 60 years ago. It is a tale of reality (biographical) and hardship experienced by a family impoverished by the untimely death of my grandfather in 1932: and how success can be borne out of disaster. If you enjoyed ""Strumpet City"", this book is no less impressive."
3,A view of Ireland after the War,"This novel, the follow up to Strumpet City, has none of the class of the old whore of a book. Farewell Companions is overly nostalgic and is more like a loose and undefined family history than a novel. The writing is not tight and is really quite rambling at times. It is a book of snapshots and cameos. I do not recommend it as being any way as good as Strumpet City, which is a pure masterpiece. Interesting as a historical account of Ireland from the twenties to the fourties, but there are better!"
4,These guys are terrific,"First heard PENIS ENVY on the radio the day before Thanksgiving and I thought I'd bust a gut laughing. I don't much care for MYN and WYMYN, but A LONELY GRAIN OF CORN is certainly worth a listen. The song, SUZY found here and on GRAIN of CORN is another one very much worth listening to more than once."
1,Not Leonardo,"This is NOT a reproduction of Leonardo Da Vinci's ""The Last Supper."" It's some other artist's terrible rendition. Be aware of this before you buy, as the preview is too small to make this fact clear."
2,There's much less here than meets the eye...,"Yes it's pretty, yes it's fairly concise, yes it's dressed up in trendy outfits, but there's very little meat on the bones. As a comparison: 21st Century Mage by the same author sounded good until you reached the part where he advocated cutting corners. This has the same approach. It's very superficial, incorporates a whole stack of material that is unnecessary (NLP, for heaven's sake...) It's a quick, easy read, but for the magician who wants to actually DO something, ACHIEVE something, there are better, more solid books out there."
3,Pretty good!,"I like this book. Has some wonderful ideas in it and it wonderful for the begginer or newbie in magick to get a start without dogma. However The book seems off-kilter. All the rituals are done in the mind, although this is ok one should do physical workings. I recommend this book to someone whos looking for some fresh dogma free ideas to add to current magickal work."
3,Excellent synthesis but lacking depth,The best part of the book is it's clear understandability and the great synthesis of different paths and mental technologies. Though all of it is very simplistic and very basic. I have a large background in NLP and less knowledge of magic. I don't even bother with the NLP techniques he presents. There is better stuff out there. The magic techniques are very cut and dry and are more guided visualizations than anything else. What this book will be is the foundation resource for a better more advanced book in this techno-magic vein which is badly needed.
5,Great Introduction for the uninitiated,I have recently become interested in The New Hermetics and I found this book to be incredibly insightful. I am looking forward to picking it up again to pick up on the nuance that I may have missed on first reading.
1,I do not like it,"It's a cheap, bulky, strip of plastic. I won't use it because it is a piece of junk. I would not recommend it for anyone."
5,From an excellent doctor to all the pregnant womens,"Just read it , it is awesone , here you will find all the answers to your simple questions from the best pediatrician of all time."
3,A Helpful Book,"I just finished reading this book today. It was good, but not great. Oftentimes, Tremper Longman III is dry. The information is of good quality, but the presentation is not very engaging. I learned a lot from this book. However, I'm looking forward to reading Leland Ryken's book How to Read the Bible as Literature...and get more out of it.Grace"
3,mary jane clark - do u promise not to tell,"liked the book . good author. my problem is i hate the bad language. i dont like to see Gods name taken in vain, especially when the book is this good and there is no reason for it. i want to be able to read a good mystery without the profanity. other than that book was good"
4,Camel crickets,"I have no mice or rats. Instead, I use this product to trap the camel crickets that keep coming in. In that use, it is fairly effective judging from the number trapped. I wouldn't bother using anything against field crickets -- they come inside in the fall, sing their songs, and die. Camel crickets don't sing, but they stay. They breed. They leave what looks like scat in the pots and dishes in the cupboard. Since I deployed four of these traps, I have only seen scat once. I ordered this product online because the local stores didn't seem to be able to find it."
1,Worthless traps,We tried these traps and the only thing we caught were the footprints of the mice/rats. What a joke/waste of money.
3,"Looks good, but shoddy",Clip lasted less than 2 months. Good thing the belt loops are there to fall back on. But what can you expect for something so cheap? It was a good purchase. Try to be careful with it.
2,Nice look but poor construction,"I was very excited about this. It has belt loops and a solid piece of metal to hang on your belt. The magnet close works well with my Palm Treo 650P and over time stretched quite securely. However, not even getting 6 months of use and then the same old problem I have had with several holsters occurs - the metal piece due to the stress of hanging on a belt and the daily on & off clipping stressed the leather material, which started to tear and seperate from the back of the holster. Happily, I had the belt loops to use, otherwise it would have been a waste of money. If I had the receipt and new the seller, I would ask for a refund or an exchange to see if it would last longer."
3,"Looks good, damages easily","This is a very cheap, but stylish phone case. While the case looks sharp, it is poor quality. I have already had the clip and one of the straps fray because of shoddy stitching. I was able to superglue them back together and it has maintained its functionality."
3,cute idea,I bought this for my son to play with. it is very sturdy and has survived being sat on many a time. It works well with the following exceptions.1. The battery powered engines get stuck on it and the cars will tip over as they go across after you give your engine some help2. It is hard for a kid to push some of the bigger cars (breakdown train) through and not get stuck.I would reccomend one of the other bridges that might be easier to use especially with battery powered engines. Otherwise it is well made and can take abuse
3,not as good as I expected,"I have 3 other Invicta watches, all of which I like, and wanted an all ""gold"" watch. My favorite is a stainless steel Pro Divers watch that I wear most of the time. This one looks a little ""chintzy"" to me and I really do not like the dial color: champagne-sunray, which is not accurately shown on the photo, which looks white. It has a wavy cheap look to it. I realize this is a value priced watch, but the three small dials are relatively functionless - hours, minutes, and seconds. I can read that from the dial! I have not figured out how to adjust the minutes on one of these small dial, but it does not really matter, since it is much easier to read the minutes on the large dial. Looks pretty good, but not as impressive as the other Invicta watches that I have."
1,Amazingly bad,"I ordered this watch over a year ago for my girlfriend, and it has never worked properly. When it came, it ran slow, losing about 10 minutes a day. I had the battery changed, and it was fine for two weeks, then started running slow again. I sent it in twice in accordance with Amazon's 1-year watch warranty, and it came back working fine for 2-3 weeks both times, but then started running slow and stopped.I don't have time to keep sending this watch back and forth, and the warranty is up anyway. I feel cheated out of over $400."
4,cool jam,"this is the kind of Jam that has a strong George Michael Influence written all over it clearly. makes me think of George Michael's ""Fastlove"". this jam still is cool and I like the Groove."
1,oh my gosh...,"This is the dumbest album ever. I mean it. It's so hopeless. The only good song is the Jojo's song, ""Baby its you"". The other songs did not hit. The sound of the musics are too ugly to listen to. I hated the fact that there were Hilary Duff in it.2 thumbs way down the hill... do not buy this nonsense, even if you're trying to waste money, this is not even worth that."
2,2 Songs r good,"#1 Rascal Flatts is Country not Pop But I really like ""These Days""#2 JoJo ""Baby It's You""ONLY GOOD SONGS ON THIS CD"
5,5 satrs cuz of jesse,"Persoan ""Mona is such a fish!"" listen up back off my man jesse and stop cussing cuz he is so cute and has a great voice"
2,I would not buy another,I had been pleased with this pump up until recently. I purchased this on May 5th and today is July 27th. The cord has broken and needs to be replaced from the way that it stores. When I went to pump the last time today- suddenly I had no power and upon closer inspection I figured out why. I was very dissatisfied with the Customer Service that I received. If you need to buy replacement parts- they don't have these available. So with a breastpump that I am dependant on and nearly $400 later- I will be bringing all the manual pieces in to work tomorrow. This is completely unacceptable to me. I would suggest buying a medela pump who has proven Customer Service.
5,No problems at all.,"I used this pump daily, about three times a day, for nearly four months. I found it easy to assemble and easy to use. The motor is very quiet. I previously purchased the Ameda PY pump, and found the experience excruciating. This pump was comfortable to use and never caused me any discomfort or problems.I do agree with the criticisms that the indicator light is poorly placed, and the storage bags are poorly designed (too small, no handle). But I consider those to be very minor issues in light of how well the pump performed."
2,Wouldn't purchase this pump........,"I purchased this pump largely due to the promoted ability to adjust the suction and rate at the handle. While this IS a great feature that I think other pumps should incorporate, the ""cons"" of the pump left me disappointed and I ended up purchasing a Medela Pump In Style instead. Disappointments/frustrations with the Avent IQ included the fact that I never got as much milk as I did with the hospital's Medela (2-3 oz. with Avent versus 4-5 with Medela) and my breasts constantly felt ""full"" and sore/achey even after pumping. Other minor irritations were that the tubing is very stiff and hard to manipulate, milk gets trapped in the top part under the diaphragm, and cleanup took longer. The bag, pump and setup are also a little bigger, bulkier and more complicated than Medela's. All in all, the control in the handle isn't worth the other down sides."
4,Very pleased with this purchase - and the price!!,I bought this product from Amazon - for more than $100 less than in the store. It is a great pump which I take to work with me everyday. It is a little on the bulky side (when all the parts are in the carry case). But it is nice and easy to put together and the settings are too easy to use. I am extremely happy with my purchase!!
1,Totally Worthless,"Not enough succion (was better in manual mode), too much pieces, isolated bags don't work at all (bottles were warmer after a couple of hours when wrapped around with a diaper), too bulky, very expensive for performance."
1,Highly Overrated Pump,I completely agree with the J.Ward review so I'm not going to say much more other then this product has way too many shortcomings. Perhaps they'll improve upon it over time.I borrowed a Medela pump when I had my first baby and was pleased with its ease of use. Not so with the Avent DUOI should have bought Medela the second time around but I figured I'd try something new. Don't ignore Medela's excelent track record. Avent's pump looks great but it is a pain to use.If you are going to spend ~$300 do yourself a favor and consider the Medela Pump In Style or other alternative.
3,Alright but too expensive for what you get,"This pump is ok, but its nothing special. All those hightec features are too confusing. I just had my second child recently and decided to buy a pump this time. My sister lives in London, and this one is all the rage over there so she told me to give it a try. It's no better than a manual pump and all of the bottles included are too large for my baby. She gets too much milk and I have to dump the rest. What a waste! You also can't change the suction, so what you see is what you get. I wouldn't recommend this pump, it's just not worth the cost. The only cool thing about the product is the bag, it's really cute."
2,No replacement parts-rendered completely useless for the second time around,"I received this pump as a present (originanlly was planning to buy a Medela pump myself). It was my best friend when I nursed my first child. Now, two years later I am expecting my second child and started looking into replacing everything for the new baby (the old silicone parts turned yellow and sticky after 2 years), preferably with BPA free parts. Not only I can't find BPA free parts, I can hardly find any parts I can replace, except for the valves and diaphragms, which is not a big help at all.I would not recommend this product. You can't reuse it for your own children. Too pricey for just one time use."
4,"Fabulous pump, expensive replacement parts","I bought this pump after my Medela Pump In Style stopped working. I got so much more milk from this one than any other pump I've ever used. And in MUCH less time! It's worth the money. However, there are two cons--it does not come with a car adapter, nor do they make one (yet, Avent says), so you need a plug. Also, to get some replacement parts (I can't wash them properly throughout my day so I was going to buy additional parts so I can always have a sterile one), you have to pay through the nose (just the petal cushion alone is $35.00! Diaphram about $15, horn $12, duck-bill valve about $2). They should come out with a battery pack or car adapter, then it would be 5 stars, even with the $$$ for the replacement parts."
4,love it- a MUST HAVE,"not terribly loud, easy to use.parts take just a couple minutes to wash upand put right back together.would definitely have given up on nursing by nowif it had'nt been for this purchase!"
3,"has potential, but...","The concept behind this movie has a lot of potential. I love the idea of a time traveler meeting the love of his life in the past. However, this is a made-for-TV movie and it shows. The acting is doesn't convey any emotion at all - a problem for a love story. This is especially damaging because with such a far fetched plot, the emotion needs to be all the more real to convince viewers that the two are in love. However, what really drags this movie down is that it goes by way to quickly. It is about 1 hour 20 minutes, about average length for romantic comedies, but it seems like very little happens during that time. At least very little that's memorable. I guess I shouldn't expect to much. The movie certainly works as a date movie, but for such a cool idea for a romantic comedy it's too bad the director didn't get more out of it."
5,"Brilliant, scathing satire of science","An oft-overlooked masterpiece of Lem's, this book portrays with astonishing acuity science's unflappably pompous tone. Confronted with an unfathomably alien message, the narrator and his colleagues are capable only of self-congratulation, having dispensed with ethics along the way."
1,I really wanted to like this book.,"Unfortunately - it is an incoherent mess.The ""author"" talks more about talking about talking about the project than actually talking about the project - and no; those aren't typos...The reader is victimized by the author into reading several chapters about how the ""manuscript"" was discovered, blah, blah, blah; etc.Pretty much the same drivel as in his other books.I actually wanted to like the book, and read the book - unfortunately I went insane trying to unravel the morass of story, back-story, flashbacks, autobiographical elements, and tangents.A very bad attempt at forcing oneself into creating a novel from a short-story - there is WAY too much filler material that has nothing to do with the actual story."
3,Heavy going exploration of ideas,"His Master's Voice tells the story of a project set up after a ""message"" is received from outer space. The story is narrated by a somewhat self-satisfied scientist involved in the project.HMV has little in the way of plot. It is more of an exploration of ideas relating to the source and meaning of the message - and a gentle satire on the machinations of top scientists. It's pretty heavy going and only marginally worth the trip.If are are thinking of reading this because you enjoyed Solaris (as I did), then you may be disappointed."
2,Brilliant but Boring,"In reading His Master's Voice at times the reader should be staggered by the powerful intellect of the author. Lem's understanding of psychology, and philosophy are greater than his considerable scientific knowledge. As an unorthodox textbook on those first two subjects I would recommend this book. As a Sci-Fi novel, however, I think it falls flat. There just isn't enough entertainment value in His Master's Voice to make it worth your while.I regret saying this because the laugh, ultimately, is on me. It seems obvious throughout the book that one of it's main purposes is to satirize ""Western"" Sci-Fi as mindless escapism. Lem was often critical of popular Sci-Fi authors and their readers for not using the genre to create stories that ask deeper questions and created a more meaningful culture around them. By declaring this book, ""not entertaining enough"" I'm only proving him right.Sorry Lem."
4,"As fiction it's dry, but worth the read nonetheless","While I recognize the brilliance in the philosophy of science that underlies this book, as a work of fiction it seemed to me to drag. Readers who prefer books in which things ""happen"" may begin to lose patience with this one before finishing it - I had mixed feelings about it myself but read through to the end. Readers who are attracted to philosophy portrayed in a creative way will love it. I wish the author had found a way to present the philosophy within a somewhat more compelling story, but in the end it's impossible to not admire this book for it's sheer intellectual power alone."
2,Picture is misleading!,"Based on the picture of this product, I thought I was buying a set that would merge tracks. NOPE. All I purchased was 12 single pieces for about half the price of the 100-piece expansion set of another brand. I am very disappointed in the marketing of the product."
4,Great Product!,"I purchased this set to add on to my son's existing set. We had purchased another set that was different, but the Thomas and Friends expansion pack fit nicely. There are a fair number of different pieces, which gave us more options when building. We are thoroughly pleased with the product."
2,Disappointed,The original album is better than this very best of The Edwin HawkinsSingers. This CD only had 3 songs I wanted to listen to. Amazon. comshould it someone to find the original album and make it into a CD
1,Beware of this Seller!,"They made a mistake and sent me the wrong watch. Ok, that happens. However they were rude and refused to pay for my return postage. Would not respond to my email and then when I tried to call back to speak with a manager, phones were not being answered. Over a weeks time would only receive a voicemail message that they were busy and to call back.Had to ask Amazon to refund my purchase price. Wondering how long the watch will sit on my desk before I receive a return postage label.No customer service with this seller!"
4,Always good,"These Pendaflex tabs always fit perfectly. I do wish the tab itself were longer, because as I get older, my category names have to be bigger. They just require more linear space."
3,The Very Best of Melanie,"Not her ""very best""--I wish I had bought a different CD of hers. Her original passion and sparkle is gone from the songs."
5,That great voice!,"Merlanie, a singer from the early 70's has a classic style to her singing.This particular CD is by far the best, and will never part with it!A rare find"
5,The memories just flowed like a river,"There never was nor likely ever will be anyone like Melanie. ""Candles in the Rain,"" what a song for the ages!"
3,please no more Brand New Key,"I saw her many times and loved her power and her covers. That Brand New Key was her best selling and chart climbing song does not make it good. It is about an inane subject and that it is totally without her normal power and and drive which sets her apart. Give me Leftover Wine, Ruby Tuesday, Look What They've Done To My Song and Lay Down but please no more pop garbage like Brand New Key. When I first heard it I wanted to empty the contents of my gut."
3,Easy to understand,"This a interesting book, it is easy to read and understand.You don't need to be a profesional.If you wanna be a carp ponder this the right book, but I think it is ...Somenthing really strange this book don't have bibliografy."
3,Okay Book.,"This book does have a lot of information on Iguanas. I just wish it was written better. The ""chapter"" breaks suck. It's hard to find information. The random qoutes throughout the book mean nothing to me."
5,All the girls in this video have great abs,"This video is fun! The music is great for the style of the exercises. It has really unusual exercises that are more like dancing, and they hit muscles that a lot of work out routines don't reach. It really made me work hard, it especially made my abs work hard. And it really works out your thighs. The instructor is very good and doesn't annoy me. She shows you the moves and then brings them up to tempo so it is easier to follow, and the moves build up into little routines that are fun and sexy. It not only helps your get into shape to look good in your bikini, it makes you feel sexier so you feel comfortable when your in your bikini. This is a pretty advanced workout that I will want to do again and again. I love the crunch series."
3,"Perky, fun instructor, decent music","I mainly only do real dance workouts or yoga, but on reading this on collagevideo com saying it had dance moves, I rented it online.I only got a few minutes into it before realized there was very little dance & has some floor work & though Lena Pereira & everyone seem fun & upbeat, I still didn't get into it. It felt a little unfocused.The DVD choices are only play & the chapters which are: belly, butt & thigh.Preview at:collagevideo com w/reviewsyoutube under ""Crunch Bikini Body Workout"" by totalfitnessdvds"
5,Exactly what I was looking for!,"I am very happy with my purchase! Great workouts, and I'm the kind of person who gets bored after 10 minutes anyways! So I love that each body part is only 10 minutes long. I also own The Firm's Jiggle free series and those are 30 minutes long, yet I do enjoy them, just not for an everyday workout, maybe twice a week..but Crunch is def. an everyday workout!!! All in all, I am very happy with this video, and already feel amazing after just one workout!! :) Good luck everyone!!!"
3,Fun! Good Instructor but Not Real Workout,This is a fun workout and really like the instructor's personality -- but this isn't much of a workout after you do it a few times -- you quickly plateau and doesn't become very challenging anymore. Maybe more suited to beginners than intermediate and advanced exercisers. Great for people who enjoy dance though as the routines are dance inspired.
5,A Book to be Treasured,"<html>The author begins with this tribute by James Russell Lowell:These pearls of thought in Persian Gulfs were bred,Each softly lucent as a rounded moon;The diver Omar plucked them from their bed,Fitzgerald strung them on an English thread.To which I feel inspired to add the following:These pearls that Omar found and Edward threadedCecile MacTaggart, to a Scotsman wedded,Took, some from one string and some from another,And in a setting splendidly imbedded.</html>"
1,Ewwww,"It's never good to start out a book for teens with terminology from a long-dead age - they claim the projects are ""never square."" It would probably have been a better move to say they ""don't suck"" or something more up-to-date. But here's the thing. They actually do suck. (Or they're ""square,"" whatever) Speaking as one of the ""Hip Young Things"" they mentioned, I can honestly say the only thing in this book I would even consider making is the halter top. The ripped up, ""punk"" sweaters just look like something from your Grandma's that went through a horrible scissor accident. And the felted wool necklace? Please. We're not THAT easily marketed too. Skip this book for something better, Like Teen Knitting Club."
1,thankfully i didn't buy this book...,"i browsed through this book at the library. thankfully, i had never wasted my money to buy it and sadly enough, i wasn't even willing to borrow it for free!the patterns MIGHT have been less than okay in the early 90's. most of it if very ""grungy."" the patterns are beyond simple and teach nothing to a new knitter other than how to cast off and cast on in the middle of a row.i'm not a teenage but am still well under 30. knitted guitar cases? knee pads? i imagine if i told anyone what i was actually knitting, the ridicule from such a stupid idea would have my friends and family laughing for weeks. and these are people who argue over who gets something knitted for them next..."
1,Don't bother,"Even beginners should stay away from this book. The patterns are pathetic, just more proof that publishers will turn out anything these days."
2,I guess I'm just not hip enough.,"This book contains a couple of cute patterns, and a lot of ugly or useless ones.The cute patterns: a cozy for an individual apple or banana, and a knit cactus.Most of the other patterns seem to be trying to hard to be ""hip."" There is a pattern for a guitar case, knee pads, and a couple really ugly sweaters. The book seems to be aimed at teenagers, but I can't imagine any teenager I know leaving the house wearing anything from this book."
2,"Great Imagery, Very Lacking Stories","While the images used in this book are fantastic, very well drawn and the color is exquisite, that's where the book ends.The fables themselves are short-winded versions, very poorly written in my opinion. I bought the book to read to my five year old, who is definitely able to comprehend intricate stories and is extremely well-spoken for his age, but the stories offered nothing for either of us... they had no lead ins , often went straight to the point (most of the stories are only one or two short paragraphs), and only one or two even mentioned the moral of the story (which is often lost due to large parts of the fables being cut out).I ended up just telling him the versions of the stories I remembered while he looked at the pictures. Definitely not a good choice."
3,Aesop's Fables,"A little thin on content, but well produced. It would have been worth the effort to include more substance. The artwork is beautiful."
4,now there is a new edition,"This book has been updated and republished in 2009 as ""Santorini: Volcano, Natural History, Mythology""Santorini: Volcano, Natural History, Mythology"
4,A Bronze Age Blast,"This is a lucid and informative book for both ancient history buffs and those interested in volcanos. The book discusses the Santorini volcano system is detail, and outlines the history of eruptions from the remote past to the present day. The greatest emphasis is on the eruption of 1640 B.C., one of the most violent volcanic explosions of all time.The text, maps and drawings are excellent, and the author presents not only what we know about the Santorini volcano, but how the scientific conclusions evolved and what the evidence is behind them. The book was published in Germany in 1994, which means that the eruption of Mt. St. Helens had not yet occurred when the book was written. Too bad -- that would have been an excellent example for the author to compare to Santorini.As a bonus, the cover, the paper quality, printing and photos are all superior to those in most hardback books available today."
5,Son's favorite,"I know this is a discontinued item, but my 4-year old son just LOVES Big City Engine. Everything arrived just as expected, in perfect condition."
5,Will things ever be the same again?,What a moving book. Lisa's parents have just dropped a big bomb on her. Her parents are getting a divorce and she does not know how to deal with it very well. So she starts spending a lot of time at the local animal shelter where she becomes attached to a stray horse She names PJ and you'll just have to read the book to find out why she named him that. Stevie and Carole are doing the best they can to be supportive of their friend in her time of need. Can they help lisa come to terms with her Parnets divorce and the sudden arrival of Pj's Orginal owner? Just read this book and you will learn all the anwers. This book Really helps to Tie into the first book of the Pine hollow Series Called the Long Road Home. Be sure to read this one!!!! IT had me tears!
5,100th book,"This book was a good ending i think and it was sort of sad though. Lisa was so sure about PJ being the horse she wanted when he was taken away from her so fast! you can kinda of sense the end of the saddleclub while u read, but i also enjoy Pine Hollow, even though its mostly romance stuff. This is a good and really emotional book and it does leave u hanging and wondering if the end is near! buy it!"
4,Discovering your Essence,"Easy reading and a powerful book. It helps us to rediscover our essence. Who am I? Why do you do the things you do. This book has helped me personally in understanding the meaning of having a balanced lifestyle, working in harmony with the environment and finding peace within myself."
1,Bo-oo-oo-rr-ii-nn-gg!!,"This zydeco stuff might be fine if you are piss-drunk, but it barely qualifies as music. I couldn't tell one track from another, so much do they sound alike.Now, that may be a good quality in zydeco. To my musician's ear this is as bad as the modern whiteboy stuff that masquerades as ""dixieland."" Which, compared to the way southern jazz has traditionally been played, is at about double the appropriate tempo.If you are one of those people who abhor silence, this disk might be for you. Otherwise, consider why there are five dozen of them offered here for cheap..."
4,Some problems,"The matlab scripts do not follow the matlab programming style,and many of the buildin functions of matlab should be used for simplicity and efficiency,such as ode45.There is a possible error in the 2nd chapter .On page 13.The closing velocity is defined asVc = -d(Rtm)/dtThe author says that"" In other words,from calculus we know that the closing velocity will be zero when Rtm is a minimum(i.e.the function is either minimum or maximum when its derivative is zero).""But the function must be contineous and *differentiable*.Just think a case with target and missile both on x axis,and missile fly with a constant speed.You will see that the Rtm function is not differentiable at x=0."
2,Great.. except it wasn't the right size,"I bought all four of the sports plaques expecting them all to be 11"" x 15"" as listed in the description. Be aware that they might not all be 11"" x 15"". Other than that I loved the plaque."
3,Color crazy,"This book on the Munsell System of color is good to have (as are all the Munsell books) for anyone seriously interested in color theory and it's history. It's certainly cheap enough, but keep in mind that it is extremely brief and lacks the original color plates (as well as any color at all), so supplemental material will be needed to fully understand the concepts. As a matter of fact, the Cleland book, ""A Practical Description of the Munsell Color System...."" (also no color) should probably be purchased with it."
4,What makes halloween fun!!,"We bought this on video back in 2003 and for whatever reason it is a family favorite every Halloween. The Skeletons are some of the best characters around! The animation is not great, but it is very entertaining and the story is straight forward halloween adventure. The 2007 DVD we have is dark in viewing at times and the added scene of the dancing contest was new and not necessary. If fact the dancing pumpkin story is great without that part. I still like it and recommend it."
1,aweful,"i don't know what these other reviewers are smoking, but not only is this think craptastic, but it seems very inappropriate for children. i mean what children's show has a character thats going to ""teach the art of pain""? i guess the other reviewers must be shills for whoever made this pos...."
4,Better Than I Expected,"I bought this on super sale, so paid less than half of the current listed price, and so this was a great value! Okay, so the CGI could have been a bit better (faces were a somewhat expressionless), and the dancing contest seems to have been added to make the movie more PC (really, are kids going to pick up on ""pumpkin diversity""?), but all in all this was a good tale and one that I had not seen before. The three included Casper cartoons and three songs on the included CD added more value to the package, although the songs probably don't make much sense unless you have watched the movie."
2,not what is advertized buy somewhere else,"The product features say that it includes spare tips, string, button and trick book and a durable polycarbonate body with no-mar plastic fixed tip. I got one used tip, a string, no die, and a directional manual. I could have bought the same product except better quality and for a lower price somewhere else. Don't buy here. Also the color i got was orange, different from the clear blue in the picture."
3,It's exactly what I expected.,"I expected a top and thats what I got. It works well. Being made of plastiv, it will break and mine did after a week. But it is what it is nshipping was on time, no problems."
1,Duncan Bearing King Sping Top won't land on its tip,I purchased this blue Duncan Bearing King Spin Top for my Grandson as I have had tremendous respect for the duncan product line for many years and have used their yo yo's and imperial spin tops with success in the past....but this top came from Amazon partner MSE Enterprises Inc.. and this top will not spin vertically no matter how you attempt to throw it. The tennis racked type of swing causes the top to spin on its side when it reaches the ground. All attempts (about 100) to change the orientation of the top in my hand as well as changes to the actual launching of the top result in the same situation...the top wants to land on its side every time.Further the package came without the fixed tip as was indicated in the enclosed instructions... I am disappointed and have ordered a different duncan top from another supplier Yo Yo Sam's to see if it makes a difference...
5,A jewel that claims for reissue.,"This is a real treasure for every music collection. With no doubt this music qualifies as one of the most beautiful and compelling ever put to an incidental music. Despite it is called as a ballet, the music is so highly symphonic thatbetter fits and works as incidental music. The music is very nordic, includingmany scandinavian dances, however there is a clear Richard Strauss influence,a composer that was always a reference for Alfvén. We can find imagination,mastery and delicious taste for orchestration. I love it. Svetlanov gives anunforgettable rendition conducting the swedish orchestra and puts his recordingas the one to get for the complete score. I simply love it. Cannot find enoughwords to recommend it so highly."
2,soulless,"The author of this book was the man who subdivided the Hope Ranch area of Santa Barbara. If he felt any connection to the land underfoot, he did not articulate it in this collection of dates, letters, and foundings of clubhouses, golf courses, and polo fields. Why he wrote the book is unclear, for it comes to an unsentimentally linear account devoid of story, emotion, or anecdote. The subtitle might have been, ""Turning a Former Rancho Into Real Estate."" Fortunately, the area under study, though now gated and guarded, remains lush and vibrantly alive."
3,Could be Improved,The Glossary and Index should be more compressive. It would be helpful if the chapter summaries included a list of highlights from the chapter and also had more review questions.
1,Boring.,"Lacks consistency. A huge amount of info poured into this book with little organization or purpose, simply to make it more difficult to pass the test."
5,Creative and tasteful,"This is one of my favorite solo piano recordings. Jessica Williams plays with grace and thoughtfulness. Her version of ""Things Ain't What they used to be"" is a study in restraint and anticipation. She breathes fresh air into familiar tunes. It's some of the most creative interpertations of standards one is likely to hear on solo piano. I don't know how she does it. Her left hand bass line is driving and yet her right hand is independent and melodic. At times you would swear you are listening to an entire trio. I highly recommend it."
1,This is one that Duke would be disappointed in,"I really don't know what Jessica had in mind with this project, but whatever it was, she lost me. It seems like she offered very little in the way of a melody to follow. I guess her thing is to improvise to the fullest extent.I felt like she took more than her fair share of chances with this recording. She seemed to manage to out do the song with her showboating. She made herself the star of the show and forgot about the song and highlighting it. In my opinion, I feel like Duke would have been disapponted with his music being presented like this.The repertoire for this cd was alright, but that was the only bright spot I could find. As far as the performances go, I would have to say NO CIGAR.Jessica if you are going to play ballads, please give us something to grasp, besides a lot of improvising. This needless improvising is very sick."
1,Finally- A Proven Sedative in Book Form!,"This is the third worst and most boring book I have ever read, after William Doty's ""Mythography"" and Claire Robertson's ""Trouble Showed the Way."" And guess what? All these books were required reading- and total stinkers. My teacher thinks Shape of Reason is the best thing since sliced bread, probably only because he was a student of Gage. Not only does the prose make absolutely no sense, I don't agree with his points. If anything, following Gage's advice would probably make you a worse writer. But most likely, you will be reading this for a class, and you won't have the option of saying no. At 45 dollars, this book is a rip-off, too."
4,Thomas& Friends rescue hospital,"This is perfect for any Thomas fan that also loves airplanes/ helicopters as it comes with one of our favorites, Harold the Helicopter, plus an ambulance as well as teh hospital itself. It is a neat addition to our Thomas train table, where our entire family plays.. from big sister to big brother to the baby.. it is one of our favorites."
5,Making Time for Spiritual Work,This book is clearly written and simple to use. Just reading through the step-by-step program helped me to see how easy it is to make time daily for myself to do a spiritual practice. I also liked her explanation of some practices which were new to me and yet easy to do.I believe Chrissie Blaze is knowledgabale and caring and her book is a good addition to my spiritual reference library. Her practices can work for any faith.
5,Yoga Teacher's Best Tool!,I teach kids yoga and I use these cards in almost all my classes. The kids love them and the illustrations are wonderful. So fun to use!!
4,Fun way to teach children yoga,I found these card very inspirational. I have just begun teaching children yoga and they were very helpful with ideas.
4,fun for kid and mom,"it's a bit easier to follow if you have a little yoga experience, but these cards do a great job of illustrating both the pose and the idea behind it (relaxing, stretching, centering, etc.). Don't expect an energetic 3 y.o. boy to do the meditating ones though..."
4,Fun tool to own for a pediatric therapist,"I have the wonderful opportunity to work as a pediatric occupational therapist. I use these cards with my clients to help promote motor planning, balance, body awareness and the list goes on. I recommend these cards to any therapists (or parents) looking for activities for their clients. It's a creative way to encourage new skills that the kids truly enjoy!"
4,"Great pictures, good ideas","I teach yoga to both adults & kids. I really liked these cards as a resource. I used the ideas for games on the backof the cards, for some of my kids' classes, & they worked well. I have also used the cards to show what the poses look like to the kids. The large size of the cards is a plus too."
5,Kids love them!!,"I work with children who have disabilities (cerebral palsy, autism, down syndrome, etc). Every child has trully enjoyed these cards. On the back the pose is broken down into 4 organized steps. It's neat to watch the kids figure out how to pose themselves. I use them for stretching, attention and concentration, deep breathing to help calm, weight bearing/strengthening, and for social groups (there are partner poses as well). A few of the parents even purchased them for home!"
2,not realistic,"I work with young children ages 3-6 in a Montessori classroom. These cards although they are fun and list somewhat clear instructions, are not easy for this age group to read and comprehend. The pictures are cartoon like and not realistic in how a child's body may actually bend or twist or reach to achieve the pose. If you are shopping for young children, I recommend that you focus on clearer and more realistic examples - for example I found some SUPERB cards and curriculum through Marsha Wenig (sp?) her book is called Yoga Kids. It also it really geared for children & has names that correlate more closely with actual yoga names & terminology - well in many case at least - ex: downward dog. In conclusion, if these are for children, Keep Shopping!"
3,Been done better before,"This Sherlock Holmes pastiche matches the great detective against Count Dracula. It's set just after 'Hound of the Baskervilles' and refers to that book quite a lot. Holmes and Watson are drawn back to the moors of the Hound and find that Dracula has set up shop there in his bid to spread vampirism across the world.[...]'Tangled Skein' offers nothing really new on the idea and has little of the 'authentic' feel of other better pastiches.[...] Although the author has cleverly woven Dracula into the story of the Baskervilles the tale lacks any real narrative drive. I found myself skimming the last few chapters. Although the author quotes from Conan Doyle there's little feel of the original stories here.[...]All in all this is a solid attempt at an interesting idea but one that falls short of the mark left by others. It's not bad, it's just not memorable. [...]"
5,Most incredible Holmes Ive listened to..,I found this work to be magnificent--- After listening to Sherlock Holmes audio for many years I was enthralled by the magic of this dramatic production... This is not a full castattempted by one person but a full cast achieved by one person --To listen is to believe only this... Listen and be carried away by the genius of this narrator..
2,DVD skips,"I purchased the DVD for a church ministry and was under a short timeline. I was pleased the DVD arrived on time, but then was very disappointed that it skipped many times starting in the middle of the movie. I ended up using another version that a friend had for the ministry but now I feel I'm out $15. I guess that's what I get for waiting to the last minute and trying to save some money for our church. Won't do that again. Very disappointed!!"
5,MIKEY ROOTS? WHO?.......,"In short, and hardly ever mentioned and unappreciated is Mikey Roots with this 1996 release. Here are some important material details...Produced by: Augustus ""Gussie"" ClarkeRecorded and Mixed at: Music Works Recording StudioRelease date: 1996Notes:Remarkable Gussie production as usual, of which incorporates many top musicians, back up singers, arrangers, engineers and mixers.This is worth purchasing...Gussie's crisp, clean production from, if not the best reggae producer who knows how to capture an artist and make their material everlasting."
1,Wrong bra sent to me,The wrong bra was sent to me. I ordered a bra for a 2009 Honda Accord. Instead I was sent a bra for a Saturn automobile. This is a very careless mistake by the shippper. The bra was also of poor quality and did not meet by standards.
5,Beautiful and balanced knives,"These are a beautiful set of knives that are perfectly balanced and have a nice solid handle. I found that they felt more secure in my hand than the thinner and more square-shaped ""three-rivet"" handles in the Henckels four star line or the Wustof classic line. Every single knife from the large chef's knife, to the small paring knife feels substantial and well engineered.I also love the fact that the set comes with a terrific Santoku knife, unlike most block sets. It makes a great all purpose chopping, dicing knife."
4,why is the roof not attached to this toy????????????,"Is it just my firehouse? The roof comes off. Why is this? It get's lost and has fallen many times. Overall, this is a fun purchase and addition to our thomas track. I love the little fire truck it comes with."
4,We LOVE Thomas!!,"We love Thomas! Not just my 4 year old son, but I love building layouts with him as well.We recently ordered the Thomas and Friends Wooden Railway-Fire Station. While overall, my son loves it and plays with it daily, it arrived broken. The roof is not attached, so when he plays he just puts it back on. Normally Thomas (wooden) products are very well made and hold up, but this one just needs some super glue to glue the roof back on.Overall, I'd recommend this toy. A fire station is a fun addition to any rail system!"
1,Uneven Color,I purchased this monitor after hearing reports about color problems with Apple Cinema Displays. I was dismayed to see a pinkish tint on the Sony as well. It was most noticeable viewing gray Web pages--it looked like there was blush in one corner. Presumably Sony and Apple use the same LCD manufacturer. I returned this monitor and purchased a smaller one without any color problems.
2,"Great in every way, except...","This monitor has great color, and is very easy on the eyes. It's a beautiful screen, and I would give it 5 stars, except for one glaring issue. Around the edges of the screen, about 1"" wide, everything is tinted pink. Perhaps not a huge deal for most users, but I do a great bit of graphic design work, and find it incredibly distracting."
2,Not at all what I had hoped,This book started with a cute premise but it fell apart in the middle and completely collapsed at the end. I must be missing something.
1,Germs on their fingers,"I returned this book. I suspect the author wrote it for herself, not for young children. The rhymes are forced, the pictures inadequate, and the premise self-serving. That is, the author advertises her posters and website. Really, what little kid wants to read a book about the life of a carpool mom? - Reader in Denver"
3,THIS IS A REMASTERED BOOTLEG!!,"This album was originally a bootleg release. Frank bought a vinyl copy and remastered it, then sold it as part of his ""beat the boots"" series in 1991. The plan was to legitimately release some material that he otherwise wasn't getting any royalties for. So don't blame him for the poor sound quality, as he had nothing to do with that aspect.If you're interested in other live Zappa albums of this genre, I recommend ""Tis the Season to be Jelly."" This is a very old Mothers concert in Sweden (1967) that contains some very unique material unlike anything else in the Zappa catalog."
3,bad sound quality but good music,"pITY ABOUT THE LOW SOUND QUALITY BECAUSE there's lots of choice music here, from 1970. We have the holiday in berlin lyrics about the student riot, that's class. Frank has some great soloing here, call any vegetable also sleeping in a jar. It's well worth hearing despite crummy sound"
3,Dr John routine,"This live cd makes a nice companion to ""Fillmore East"". It's the same line-up (Flo and Eddie), the humor's there and it rocks. The sound isn't the best (It was originally an audience recorded bootleg) but the music and humor win you over. My favorite part is the ""Dr John routine""...Zappa's impression of Dr John doing ""Wino Man'."
2,forget this one,"The 1971 line up was not Zappa's best although it could pull off some neat little numbers like ""Fillmore East"" or even produce a masterpiece such as 200 Motels (Admitedly with a lot more musicians).But this record is way below Zappa standards both in contents and in form. The sound is awful, and the performances nothing to write home about. I give this two stars because any Zappa record, however bad, deserves more than one. But get ""Filmore East"" or ""Just another band from LA"" instead. Anything but this. You'll fell cheated by this one."
4,The Rock Show,"This is a great, fast-paced, energetic track. My only complaint is the lack of CD-Rom video since the video is great. Nuff said."
5,Slacks,I ordered the slacks for my dad who is 88 yrs old. They are comfortable for him to wear and look great. Very easy to put on.
2,Nexus: The Jupiter Incident,"This game is made by the same mob that made Imperium Galactica, but you would never guess. It's not even in the same street. Dull and boreing is my estimate. It's pretty similar to Homeworld 1 and 2 which is much the same.They are more first person shooter games rather than strategy games.Frank Brown"
4,Solid game,"On a 10 scale...Graphics...9Gameplay...8Story......8Replay.....6This game has no significant flaws. Overall the game is really fun to play but, I would caution anyone who is not a fan of this particular type of game. My affinity for space battles and strategy helped this game score bigger with me than it would for certain others. Rated on just it's strategy alone, it's still a solid game. That stands true even for those not partial to the setting. As for the replay, there isn't much of a reason to revisit the game once complete."
3,Not worth the price... well worth playing...,"The price set for this game is simply too high given how limited the game is, the campaign is fairly short and while the graphics are spectacular that is the only thing about this game worth playing it for... if say it had more mods or if they would fix the glitches that are all too apparent the price would be well worth the expense..."
2,"Fun, but too buggy for commercial release","Nexus is a very entertaining game that is severely marred by an inexusable level of instability. It seems like the program shouldn't have even passed the alpha testing stage, much less beta testing, and definitely should not have been sent out for commercial release. The game crashed to desktop, bluescreened or glitched into an unplayable state more times than I could count.Apart from that, we have a very beautiful space sim with intuitive controls, an engaging story, and good voice acting. It was enough for me to overlook the crashes enough to get to the ending (that and I wanted to get my 40 bucks worth). Unfortunately, the lack of stability keeps me from rating this game any higher."
3,Play the demo frist secound and thired,"This game is intresting, play the demo frist is what i have to say. Not just once but take a week or two off play the demo again and then again if you did not get it the frist time. Problem i ran into was its controles are nothing freeformed like Homeworld i started clicking and nothing would happen. But after a few months i cam back to the demo after seeing the game on amazon again and it made sences more. you don't controle the units freely you have to have a target to send them to. Over all i liked the game just wish i could send my ships anywayre i want. Not just way points and guarding ships. Oh well it will wast a few hours"
3,A great composer-conductor far out at sea,"From the 30s onward, Britten loved Mahler -- he wrote in a letter that hearing Das Lied von der ERde made life worth living -- and in 1961 he took a shot at conducting Mahler's most poular symphony. The first thing one notes about Britten's interpretatiion of the Fourth is the much too fast tempo in the first movement, barely leavened by a few ritards here and there, but that's hardly the worst of it. Britten and his fairly tidy orchestra (the LSO, playing in a resonant Oxford church) are simply at sea. The essential pulse of the music is lost because Britten insists on a strict, unyielding beat. This live performance must have been fun for the audience, and it's a real curiosity, but sometimes even a great conductor goes into territory that is too unfamiliar, and that's the case here. I fidgeted from start to finish and was glad when the end arrived."
2,A little disappointing,"I expected this to be more in the form of a documentary but it's really a collection of short films and ""soundies"", the ""music videos"" of the day. However, if you are into older type music and singers such as Count Basie and Nat ""King"" Cole, you might enjoy it."
1,This product contains POISON-Hydrogenated Oil!,"First, I got the worst flush with this product so the claim of NO FLUSH is blatantly false. Problem is the FLUSH doesn't happen all the time which just means that the manufacturing process of the product is SLOPPY. One of the things that good vitamin/supplement manufacturers pride themselves on is ""Product Standards"" a type of gaurantee that every pill has equal amounts of the the supplement you are purchasing. If I get FLUSH on Monday but not on Tuesday means that there is not quality control.Additionally, there is HYDROGENATED VEGETABLE OIL. According to the Mayo Clinic Website, ""When it comes to fat, trans fat is considered by some doctors to be the worst type of fat. Unlike other fats, trans fat -- also called trans-fatty acids -- both raises your ""bad"" (LDL) cholesterol and lowers your ""good"" (HDL) cholesterol."" I called the manufacturer for a refund and they declined."
3,Probably fine for kids...,"I like great white sharks a lot. And while I wouldn't say I have a collection, my work desk does feature a few great whites along the cubicle wall. Unfortunately, this one is by far the ugliest. On the brighter side, it's solid - not hollow - and should withstand a lot of kid abuse."
2,Best of the Ronettes Review,There were only a few songs that were familiar. I didn't like the majority of the other songs.I thought since this was suppose to be their greatest hits that I would be more familiar with the songs on the cd.
5,Spirit of the Celtic Heart,Kate Crossan has a quality to her voice that keeps you coming back and back to this CD. It is upbeat but relaxing. It transports you to another time and another place. I continue to search for any others CD she has recorded.
5,WARNING: CAN'T PUT IT DOWN,"This is a must-read for anyone, I must advised once you start reading you will not put it down until you are done and then you will start to glow."
5,The man who took a chance on himself.,"I think it's great that A.L. Williams was able to go from a $10,700 coaching job to one of the richest people in the world now worth over $1.5 billion. It proves that this man who took a chance on himself, took a chance that worked tremendously.Even more impressive is how many people A.L. Williams has helped over the years. Not only the people who joined his company and creating financial freedom, but also all of the people who realized the folly of (w) hole life insurance (and other forms of cash value insurance), the kind of insurance where your money goes into a hole.A.L. Williams taught people to ""buy term and invest the difference."" He also taught people to believe in themselves. Are you willing to take a chance on yourself? Then read and carefully study this book and learn the principles of succes that A.L. Williams used to create one of the greatest success stories of all time!"
5,Courage to make a difference,Art Williams comes from the no-nonsense culture of the south. I too was raised with these straight shooting values and find his courage to make a difference truly inspirational. He took an industry that forever had a bad name and revolutionized the approach of helping people to win. He created a win-win for the insurance industry and allows people to feel terrific again about doing the right thing. Do the right thing for yourself and read this account of how he learned how to market doing the right thing and make it possible to earn a handsome living doing it.
5,The best Motivational Book I have EVER read,"I have read this book for over 14 times, each time I learn more and more new things. Tomorrow I will start reading it again. This time I will be geting best out of it. Sincerely Mynor Vargas"
1,Don't buy here,"Ignore the rating, I don't have mine yet. I just wanted to point out that this is only $20 at the Harley site."
4,Very elegant dress watch,"I bought this watch as a gift for my wife and she loved it! It is very elegant for dressy or formal occasions and is more like a gold bracelet than a watch when worn. The only minor down side would be that the face is very small and has no numbers or bars to separate the hours, but really this is just part of the style."
4,Terrific watch.,"Prompt delivery. Beautiful timepiece and band. Solid construction throughout, typical of Invicta. Invicta is a great value, and this watch is no exception. Note about photograph: rose gold in person looks more like new shiney copper than pink. Very cool color. The face design evokes a celestial feel that I like. Cannot be seen well in photo: the blue face of the watch has a subtle elegant design texture. Nice. My only disappointment with the watch is that the design texture on the watch face looks slightly plasticy as opposed to a deep luscious enamel paint(though not as plastically or as cheap-looking as the face of a Citizens Eco-Drive watch). Otherwise I would have scored it 5 Stars. Brown leather and blue dial watch can be worn with most clothes in my closet."
4,Prime Time Swimsuit Models,"The cover model, Brooke Morales, used to be a cheerleader for the Raiders when they were in Los Angeles (there's even a little footage of her cheering on Jay Fiedler). The process showing how they narrowed the choices down for the cover shot to the ultimate choice is impressive."
4,Good advice from early reviewers,"If you collect singles from the 60's and 70's, this is a good Tommy James compilation because you get the LP version of Crimson And Clover."
4,surprisingly cohesive,"I always considered TJ and the Shondells lightweight back in the day, but this collection has a very good set of songs and the recording is well mastered with little compression to my ears. I still play and enjoy it a few times a year."
4,Contains long version of Crimson and Clover!,"I had this CD once already but my sister's friend wanted it so bad that I had to give it to her. I'm now buying it again. First, this has the long ""album"" version of Crimson and Clover. People will be glad to know that. Second, this CD was really psyodelic. I think I saw colors flowing out of my speakers. I was very pleased with this CD."
5,Long version,This is the only CD that contains the long version of Crimson and Clover with all the feedback and fuzz with the guitars. Great if you have headphones for this one. Psychedelia in it's finest hour. Check it out. For the price you can't go wrong. Other tunes are equally exciting.

2,Poorly designed toy,"My 3 1/2 yr old son LOVES Thomas and Friends. He was thrilled when he received Thumper because the Boulder video is one of his favorites. Unfortunately, I agree with the other review, the tread constantly comes off Thumper. As soon as my son pushes Thumper the tread slips off and I have to put it back on. This is extremely frustrating for anybody much less, a toddler. He went from being thrilled to chilled. He occasionally comes back to Thumper and tries to play with him, but of course, the tread slips off and he is disappointed. This is definitely not a well designed toy when it comes to the treads and their fit. The rest of Thumper is just as cute and durable as all of the other wooden Thomas trains. Skip buying this one if you can, otherwise your child and you are in for frustration and disappointment."
2,Pain in the neck!,"My 3-year-old son has a ton of the Thomas vehicles and loves them, but Thumper is poorly designed. The treads fall off the wheels right away, and you will be spending your time replacing them every 5 minutes! I'm not sure why the previous reviewer gave this item 5 stars while complaining about the treads coming off. This is my major complaint with Thumper."
3,Thumper is so-so,"My son had wanted this addition to his Thomas collection for quite some time. As a potty training reward he got it. Unfortunately, it wasn't as anticipated as the rubber rollers on the bottome are really hard to move so it isn't able to move along any surface."
2,Not working so well 2 weeks in,"We received this bag in August, before school began on 8/25. For the first 2 days, the built-in iPod connection worked, but there were challenges requiring that the iPod or iPhone couldn't have a protective case on it in order to properly plug in to the pack. Within another week the remote control built into the shoulder strap stopped working, and sound is only intrmittent through the earphones. We're going to take one more look at it this weekend to see if we can fix it, but if not we'll be returning it to try another one. If the 2nd one doesn't work either, we'll return it too and give up on this model."
3,visualbasic for anyone,now i beleive that even i can learn vb. this book is i think is the only one which i think starts from abc of programming and vb.
3,Product Photo Not Correct,"As I suspected, the unit is not as shown in the product photo. The clamp shown in the product photo is a #249. What is being shipped is a #449 as fully identified in the written information. I haven't used it yet. I hope the plastic clamp is adequate."
5,Grandkids enjoying it !!,I bought this set for the grandkids to play with at Nana's house. The children age 5 and 2 are really enjoying it and Nana couldn't be happier. I have added a few Thomas destinations without purchasing extra track. If you are considering a Thomas collection for your little ones this is a great set. Watch for sales !! Amazon has some really good ones !
1,Horrible choice for small children,"Unless you are super strapped for cash, if you have a small child ( mine are almost 3 & 5) I would advise you to avoid this bridge. This simple structure is the 'worst' of any of the Thomas & Friends bridges that we have run across. It is extremely unstable and difficult to set up. Unlike the other bridges (which have pins, are solid, or have flip-out supports) this structure depends on friction and two wooden blocks that have to be placed 'just right'. We ended up spending more money almost right away rather than to have the wails of frustration.Since our version of this track now sits on the side lines, we would suggest to just add to the sum you would spend here and buy something that won't be so frustrating."
5,victor,"the victor fly trap certainly is a fly magnet , it totally eliminated my fly problem the neighbors had a litter box on their back open porch and i was being invaded with pesty flies but thanks to the victor fly magnet problem solved thank you amazon for your support and web site for a easy purchase"
5,Excellent Product,I originally purchased the smaller version of this product but upgraded to this version. It was 3/4 full of flies and I ended up throwing it away after maggots started appearing. It's pretty gross but very effective. I highly recommend purchasing more than one rather than re-using it.
2,Make sure you know your fly types,"I had read that there are different types of flies which come out at certain times of the year, etc. Obviously I did NOT know our type flies OR I missed their 'season' because I only caught a few flies - when there were lots around when I began looking for a solution. Hoping to do better next summer. PS These are smelly & unsightly. Not something you want indoors or, in the least, near you. Maybe on a window sill, behind a curtain or blind."
5,Fly Magnet,"I am absolutely floored at how well this product works! We put one by our trash can outside & one close to my neighbors dog pen & they are full by the end of 1 week. I don't know what it is that attacts them, but you can sit & watch them go in one right after the other. I highly recommend this product!"
2,STINKY,I tried using this product in the garage after purchasing at a farm store. The traps made it smell like something died in the garage. Two traps got 2 flies in 3 days and there were a LOT of flies around. My kids swatted a lot more flies than these traps caught. Then I placed them outside where one trap caught maybe 100 flies and the other caught 1 (in addition to the 2 it got in the garage). But even outside the odor was so bad my husband asked me to get rid of the traps.
2,"Nice design, poor performance.","I'll go withRescue Big Bag Fly Trapin the future. They helped my business stay in business. No more flies after just a 2 weeks. The only thing to watch out for is rain. Cover your RESCUE traps when it rains.Simply put, every single big fly in the yard outsmarted the VICTOR trap.Flies: 1Victor: 0"
5,"If you liked Vol.1, you'll love Vol.2!","This volume is even better than volume one. It contains some fabulous and inventive takes on the classic tune, without the ""novelty"" songs of the first volume. My favorite is the Angels and their very authentic recreation, including the false start after the guitar solo."
5,A Masterpiece!,"Proportion is to space what rhythm is to music - this is what prof. Burckhardt tells us. One can reveal through music a thought, an idea, a feeling, but that is possible to do with space as well. And when conveying the Truth the architecture becomes a vehicle as well. A vehicle that helps the seeker come close to the Divine. However, it is not only architecture and music that facilitate this transformation of the soul. Art, the sacred art, based on certain principles can reflect immutable truths. The ability of prof. Burckhardt to perceive these principles and explain in detail what each of them corresponds to is nothing short of extraordinary. His insights into the very heart of religions are humbling... He saw the matrix!I want to thank you prof. Burckhardt... may you soul rest in perfumed peace wherever you might be!"
1,dry as a desert,So boring and so dry it is of no use. There are other better books out there (that's why it is out of print).
5,The Best of George Jones (1955-1967),"George Jones is the greatest country singer ever,and this compilation shows why George Jones is a country singing legend.If you are a fan of classic country this is a must have. George Jones is a legend that not many singers can come close to,and only Nashville singers wish they could be."
5,Great songs!,"This band has it all. Great, catchy tunes and original music that is a blessing to the ears in this soul-deprived post-alternative music culture.I plan on being a fan for years to come! Can't wait for the next album!!"
1,A waste of time and money,"This author doesn't even seem to like the show. He loves Zahn but that is about it. Factual errors, thin skinned about jokes, and way over sensitive to imagined woman hating. He made a few good points but not worth the time or the money."
2,Disappointing Book on a Fantastic series,"I ordered all three books without thinking. I should have ordered only one at a time, then I would not have bought the other two. Not at this price. For as small as the first book is, and no photos or anything else in the book, it isn't worth the price. And, as another reviewer mentioned, there are a lot of typos! That was irritating. As a reviewer, Talis does ok. As he mentions, I don't have to agree with everything he says. I think he missed the point on some episodes, though, and I think he could have been more in depth on some. I hope the second book is better. I noticed it is larger, so I have some hope that my money was not so misplaced. I would have been happy with the book had it been more the price of a small paperback novel."
2,Faux Mystery,"After having read several of Tamar Myers' mysteries, I am coming to find them formulaic and a bit too self-conscious. While reading ""So Faux,"" I found that I could predict what would happen next. Though the content differed from previous novels, the structural elements remained pretty much the same. Once again (as in another of Myers' novels), there was the reference to a ""frizzy-haired"" writer of mysteries, who I assume is to be the author, herself. This type of self-consciousness in a writer can distance the reader from her work and shatter the suspension of disbelief that is so necessary to the enjoyment of a book of this kind.Myers' humor failed to make up for the thin plot, the one-dimensional characters and the lack of a well-defined place. This was simply an unsatisfying read."
3,Loose Plot in this one,"I have always found the Magdalena Yoder series to suffer from loose plot syndrome, but up to now the Den of Antiquity series didn't seem to have this problem, but it sure was apparent in this book. Ms. Myers' characterizations are usually quite good, and that doesn't disppoint in this book, but the plot is definitely disjointed, and when the real murderer is found I couldn't help but think, ""Where did that come from?"" There is simply no way that the story led to that murderer. It was a real surprise, but not a surprise that made any sense at all. The one unique thing about this book was that we got to see Abigail Timberlake and Magdalena Yoder in the same book, as Abby goes on a road trip to Hernia, Penssylvania on the trail of her murderer and forger."
5,"Love this book, but half the price at Rainbow Resources!","My 4th and 5th graders used this book this year. We loved it! I'm always looking for great resources for teaching geography. I just came back to order two more of the same book for my next two kids in line but was shocked at the prices. I'm ordering from Rainbow Resources for $7.50 each. It isn't often I buy a book anywhere other than Amazon, but I'm glad I shopped around a bit!"
2,Disappointed,The book had been previously used with marks on each page. The information within the book was what I expected. Will think twice before puchasing a workbook again.
4,Decent introduction,"This is not a bad introduction to Spanish. Dialogues are as real as they get in an entry level language book. The book covers the basics needed for a traveller who is about to visit Spain (it is NOT the Latin-American Spanish). The problems I had with this book: VERY light on grammar (past and future tenses are introduced in the last two chapters), some grammatical structures are used which are never explained - you have to memorize them without understanding, the short dictionary at the end of the book does not include all the words used in the course - in fact some words and expressions used are NEVER translated in the book, dialogues are supposed to be authentic, but it is just impossible to understand some of them - speakers mumble at the speed of light - what is the point of including those in the entry level course? Use this to get you going quickly, then, if you want to, move on to something serious... Oh, and DO NOT get the ""plus"" stuff, things get even worse there..."
5,Best Multivitamin Ever!!!,"I have tried many different ""super"" multis (not the wimpy ones like Centrum, etc.). I cannot tolerate those with iron so this one has a nice balance of B vitamins and and excellent formula with higher amounts of essential nutrients. As an added bonus, it also has some greens in it. I have stuck with this vitamin ever since I found it. Highly recommend it."
5,"Must have for any first time coach, or long time coach that needs improvement.","I am a first time coach, and this book has been a true gift for me! Every idea is wonderful and the printable forms have been so helpful. I wish I could say more, but I have 19 girls waiting for me to begin practice right now. A practice that will be organized, consistent and well worth their time thanks to Pam's book.Sincerely,A Cheerleading Coach from Washington State"
3,The Heart of a Teacher,"This was a nice book for a new teacher. I was excited to get it, but when it arrived I was a little disappointed. There was a personal message on the first page to the previous owner. I very carefully cut teh page out with an exacto knife. I hope that the reciepant didn't notice the page missing! There was no notice of the personal message in teh book description."
5,The Munchy My Dogs Love,"My dogs, 5 of them all love the munchy csticks. They each get a couple after their meals, which gives them a little treat and helps to clean their teeth."
2,"Not for aggressive chewers, and Made in China","Very good value for the quantity, so I tried them. My chihuahua loves them, ... but as I watched, he goes through one in 2 minutes or LESS. Gone.And after reading the package, I see they are made in China; I wish I had known that first, I would not have purchased.I found that chews, treats and other products by Zukes, Smokehouse and Beefeaters are made in the USA, are VERY reasonably priced - and the quality is much better. The Beefeaters chews take him days to get through, and they are 100% digestible.So I'm not without options for quality treats that last that are made in the USA."
2,full of bizzare transitions and plot inconsisticies,"This book more full of holes than my old fishnet stockings. Characters marry, get sick, committ murder, and act in inexplicable ways. They appear and disapper without entering or exiting the room. By the end I was frantically paging back and forward through the book trying to figure out where a character was injured, or married or did some of the things that are noted. I even checked page numbers wondering if somehow a few chapters had been omitted from my copy. AWFUL."
3,Just OK,"The hippo moves its mouth. That's cute. The yellow box car is too tall to go under the bridge that we have. The yellow car has pictures of animals, but otherwise is not an outstanding car. It does not appear as special to my 5-year-old as I had expected when I bought it."
5,Versatile project storage,"These file boxes are the most versatile file storage I've seen. They fit in file drawers or on a bookshelf. It's easy to grab the one you need for the project at hand. If you have shelf or table-top space, but not enough file cabinets, this is the solution for you."
4,Works well for smaller filing needs,The Oxford Decoflex Black Desktop File (I bought two of them) provides a convenient place to sort and store hanging files when desk space is not readily available. I have a smallish bookcase nearby and can easily store the files inside it which makes the Decoflex handy to use. They also work well for specialized folders that you want to keep separate such as medical files or tax files or whatever specialized category you want. You can keep them filed in a Decoflex holder filed elsewhere.
3,Good Storage,"Convenient storage for those who like to stay organized, and on the go. Perfect for sharing office cubicles/work stations. Just wish it could hold a little more files."
5,Oxford Decoflex Desktop File 23013,"5 stars all the way. It is very sturdy and easy to use. Works great with a tickler system. Works great for project tracking, etc. Just enough space to organize files, without taking over the desk."
4,Decent enough desktop file...,"that seems fairly durable. I use it to hold bills that come in because I have a nasty habit of tossing everything onto my coffee table as they arrive and hate filing. I also store end of the year tax statements as they arrive without having to hunt around for them in my main storage file. Just a good organizer for tossing in things that will need your immediate attention before archiving elsewhere. Attractive enough without looking too tacky to leave out and it does help organize clutter if you are prone to that with paperwork...which I certainly am. For the holder, the hanging files and the tabs I think it was at a good price point for my purposes."
3,Ok but a little cheap,This is a simple file folder holder. It's lasted for a while and I'm perfectly satisfied but not astounded. I wish I knew it came with file folders (probably should have read the description better) because I also ordered those.
3,Baza Antifungal Cream Barrier,"Service and price was very exceptable. However, I must say that I was looking for a particular product. This was not the product unfortunately, so I went back to the site and realized that the container and descriptions were so simular that I really couldn't identify the product I wanted. The product I recieve did however meet my needs."
3,I wish this movie showed more detail,I wish this movie elaborated more regarding her life and relationship with Jesus. The movie was okay. Any movie about saints I find interesting.
1,Not the best.,This movie came off really fake. Very poor acting. Probably a lovely story but I couldn't watch it because it was so badly done.
5,works!!!!,"Bought this to cut down on the amount of flies on our back porch. Within a day it was a quarter full and practically to the top in a week. Worked so well we'll be getting several more. Substanially cut the amount of flies around the porch and house.Extremely easy to use.. Just take off lid.. pour in dried attractant, add water to line on cup, snap on lid, fit on the second lid and hang. Instructions say it takes a few hours for attractant to activate so you don't have to worry about smelling up the house. Comes with everything you need.We hung ours about 25 ft. from porch and as stated was full in a week.You actually probably could reuse this trap if your not too squemish about dumping dead and dying flies and cleaning the cup all you'd need then is more attractant. We just took down the trap and tied a plactic grocery bag around it and tossed the whole thing. At 5.99 not that bad of a loss but we'll probably move up to a larger size seeing it worked so well so quickly."
3,NOT AS GOOD AS OTHERS,"I live near the woods and have a very large back yard that my dogs and kids love to use, so it's no surprise that we can get a lot of flies. I wanted to test out three different fly traps to see which would work best for me. I tried this trap, the 20,000 rescue fly trap bag, and a larger bag. This one came in second place in my mind, which is why I rated it with three stars. First, the amount of flys caught was not bad, but it wasn't very good when comparing it to the 20,000 rescue fly trap. Second, I saw that some flys were able to get out (which was not the case with the previously mentioned product). Is this a good trap? Yes, it will catch flys. However, it's not the best from what I saw. It's recommended if you can't get the 20,000 rescue fly trap bag."
5,Did what it was supposed to do.,Ecellent. Very easy set up and it started to trap the flies immediately. We caught dozens of flies in just a few days. And it isn't even placed where there are many flies around. Would purchase it again.
2,review of fly trap,This fly trap is not worth the money. It doesn't do the job at all. The ones I bought else where were much better. Don't buy them. There are much better ones out there.
3,Works too well,"Absolutely amazing how it attracts houseflies. I put up five of them and in four days they were overflowing - I'd estimate at least 500 flies. Only trouble is that I've never had that many flies in my yard. It seems that the odor (like in stench)attracts flies from far and wide. Admittedly I live downtown, surrounded by rowhouses but as I said, this works too well. In fact, we had a garden party last evening and I had to keep all the food covered. Maybe if I put out a hundred fly traps I'll eventually trap every fly in Baltimore. Other than that, it's back to the good old spray."
4,Takes a while before it begins to work,"Put this right next to my outdoor trash can, flies all around - did not trap one fly in over one week. HOWEVER, I am updating this review...it did take over a week to start working, but when it did, it did what it is supposed to!"
2,Cheap plastic and difficult lid,"This is meant to be reusable but after staying outside last summer the plastic just became flimsy. What this means is I couldn't get the lid on it at all this year, it buckled and bent and ended up with a couple holes from the bending. Of course getting the lid on was a nasty struggle before once it's filled, the bait filled water will splash and I don't particularly like the idea of bacteria spores hatching on my hands. If the lid screwed on all this could be averted. It didn't come with a rain guard either.The bait itself works like a charm, can't complain about that. I think I might make my own container and just buy bait."
4,"So far, so good!","It is early in the ""fly"" season and already I have noticed a bunch of flies hanging out around our patio. So, I put two of these out two days ago and I can happily report that there are only a couple flies out there right now, the rest are in the traps! YAY! So happy, these work great, will definitely buy more as the need arises."
2,Cheeapp!,"Not very good. More like a gimmick. The cup was very flimsy, and did not kill for as long or as effective as other fly traps. I would definitely recommend to go another direction on this."
3,"It worked, but very slowly","It didn't catch any fly in the first 3 days, only after I took the top off it started to catch a few. Less than 2 a day, which is really not that good, I kill 3 a day with my fly paddle. Now after a week I see about 10 or so died fly, but I can't say that it doesn't work, but its just slow, and the fly just stay on top of the cup, they just don't fall in."
1,stinky,"This thing smells like trash, which I can only assume is intentional, and doesn't trap flies. I had no success."
1,doesn't work,I dont know what all the good reviews were for. it is very small trap. i have had it out for two days and all it got was 1 bee. all the other flies are still flying around
2,Flimsy size - go Bigger,"This ""pint"" size container is nothing more then a ""to go cup"" and a flimsy one at that. Hard to secure the lid without crushing the cup - not worth the price. Better to order the Quart size version - much sturdier or make your own by drilling holes in quart jar of your own. The bait itself works really well."
2,Dissapointing,"ok, i was not a big fan of their debuit, but that album is a gem in comparison to this. i dont understand the hype about this album. and i dont understand why people are all over kevins balls saying hes this great songwriter. i was expecting a prog rock masterpeice seeing the lineup and hearing the reviews. but this album just does not deliver. and i was NOT impressed by kev moore one bit. thank god hes not in dream theater anymore if this would have been pushed into their sound that would have blown. rudess blows this dude into dust. now on the plus side. the rhythem section is great. mike portnoy plays great and so does Shaun malone. but thats about it. not impressed. major potental no delivery. and this is not progressive rock....want good prog rock? check out these newish albumsFrost - MilliontownDream theater - Systematic chaosriverside - second life syndromeredemption - origins of ruin"
3,Missing An Important Ingredient,I don't know anything about this band. I just stumbled across them on Yahoo's Music Unlimited. My general impression is that the songs are sonically quite good. A really good blend of new electronic sounds with a touch of hard hitting intervals for a rather nice balance. The missing ingredient is lyrics. The songs are just horrible in subject matter and sometimes uncomfortably stupid. I would love to hear this whole album re-done with different lyrics.
5,Excellent Guide,This is a fantastic book for anybody wondering what's wrong with their relationships. It provided answers as well as avenues for problem solving. Read this one first & you can skip the others!
5,recommendation plus,"Having recently read several books on this topic, I found this author's work to be quite readable (well written) and generally applicable to current western culture. I believe most readers (with or without narcissistic tendencies) would find something of personal value from it."
4,Valuable Information in Relatable Format,This is a good book for anyone to read. I like the metaphor of the Wizard of Oz and the practical advice provided.
5,Start With This Book First,"I have read a few books on the subject of narcissism, and this relatively concise one is the best of the lot. The author absolutely nails on the head the characteristics of the narcissist and the resulting bewilderment of his/her ""targets"". The analysis of the narcissist is both accurate and compassionate, without becoming sentimental. For me, being able to see narcissists as deeply wounded helps me cope with the frustration that occurs in my dealings with them, while reinforcing the need to hold my personal boundaries."
4,Great insight,"Aside from therapy, this book has given me insight of what I was blinded by. It gives me hope for a better self. Never again will I be trapped in someone else's world. Thank you."
5,The Wizard of Oz and other Narcissists,A wonderful book that I have used as a mental health therapist with many clients. It opens their eyes to the world of narcissism and how they have been trapped in it.
5,excellent book,"This book is well written, concise, and does an excellent job explaining narcissism - its symptoms, roots, different manifests and ways to cope with. I wish there was a section for the narcissit inclined person (not the full NPD) on how to grow from it and get free from excessive self love."
4,To be carried everywhere and browsed on need,"This book is exactly the survival kit for victims of narcissists that I have been loking for. Enlightened, clear, simple, straight to the point.(I would have appreciated a few words on what kind of personality disorder individuals may end up caught up in the narcissist's net, and more practical tricks on how to deal with them from the specific point of view of the ones who get most easily hurt: bordeline and dependent.)(Also lacking, the whole sexual sphere: where does NPD cross sexual perversions, where it only appears to do, where it does not, and how to manage all that in relationships. A major theme in love, after all."
1,"Not anything like I expected, bad","Purchased the Wizard of Oz, in paperback for myself and for my mothers kindle. Spend all that money, and the book was about fairy tales. Was totally disappointed. Went by the reveiws when I purchased it. If I wanted a book on fairy tales I would of bought one. Most of them the way they were presented, didn't make much sence. Was the worst book I ever read, very little about narcissim. Don't waste your money."
3,Helpful,"I found the definitional information and the insight into the NPD's mind extremely helpful. My relationship is more of a third hand situation - more like a sister in law rather than any of the relationships described in the book. However, I got enough good information out of the book to make it completely worth my time and money."
5,The wizard of Oz and other narcissists review,"This book outlines the most practical things that can be noticed in what the narcissist does to you. With this knowledge, it has given me the way to accept things and look at them objectively especially with my relationships with narcissists (personal and work relationships). Leaving a narcissist is a difficult thing as I have done so, but the narcissist is not letting go. Although emotionally difficult to move on in my situation, this book has helped me realize that the narcissists will do what they do all the time, and it is now my call if I want to stay in this relationship or not. Although like any other separation, this separation is painful for me, but this book has shown me that it is a better place to not be in a relationship with a narcissist."
5,understanding your inner personality,"I recommend this book to anyone who is sick and tired of attracting the same old same old in so much as people and things, into their lives."
4,Learned a lot,I did learn a lot from this book and would recommend it as a worthwhile intro; not a lot of concrete suggestions on how to get thru day to day drudgery and interactions; will continue to seek out information to address this.
4,Very revealing and enlightening,"If you are in a relationship that is a challenge on many levels, this book will give you insight. I have been trying, for years to figure out what is going on in this person's mind and finally I found answers. If you have been wondering why family matters don't matter to this individual, and why you feel your thoughts and feelings really don't matter to them, this book helps you to understand. While I understood spiritually, I didn't understand mentally, and now I see the reasons."
5,An amazing book!,This book is the most comprehensive explantion of Narcissists that I have ever read. Other books don't cover the depth of damage or the ways to manage that this book does. A must read if you suspect that someone you know in your life may be a narcissist. I found it a lifesaver as it started me on the road to recovery and I have given away many copies to those I see suffering from the harmful effects of these difficult souls.
5,Great Quality,"I don't remember how much I paid for these, but they are great for lifting tracks. They are literally just pieces of wood, but they are just the right size and good. Wouldn't pay much more than $5 for them though."
3,"Must be used with glue, screws, or nails",I use these to make elevated track but I drill the track with countersinking bit and use a wood screw to secure the track to the risers. If you plan on making elevated tracks without using glue or screws or nails your child will destroy the elevated track setup in minutes.
4,No problems on East Coast,"I think this is the best product in this market space. I live in the DC-area and travel quite a bit to New York. The iTrip works just as good on the Beltway as it doed on the Belt Parkway. All I do is keep it on 87.9 since that is not a legal frequency in the US. Since my car's Bose stereo can tune into 87.9, it just works. The only areas I've experienced problems are near the White House and some of the streets (not avenues) in midtown Manhattan. Otherwise, it is worth the price!"
4,Doesn't work great all the time.,"Many friends of mine have it and swear by it, but for me it did not really deliver. I am in metropolitan area and drive a lot, after I set the channel within 5 driving minutes I have to change the station as there would be interference. It gets annoying after the 10th time."
4,Don't buy the white one,"If you plan on using the iTrip in your car, buy the black one - it will look better if you also have a black case for your iPod (I know this sounds stupid, but I didn't think about it right away, either).The iTrip works great. You can switch the broadcast station directly from the iPod and the reception sounds good - not CD quality, but good.It simply does what it's supposed to."
2,Good for FACTORY STEROS ONLY,I had a 2002 VW Jetta with a factory grade stero in it and the ITRIP worked fairly well. It wasnt the best signal ever but it was nice. I bought a Nissan 350Z with a BOSE Setero in it and the Itrip is worthless. I cant hear anything but static and buzzing out of it. Everyone warned me not to get one but i wanted to try it for myself. Live and learn. Best way to hook up your IPOD is to fork up the $200+ and have a professional install you a docking station in the car.
3,Canon Power Adapter,"I like the idea of having an AC adapter for my Canon Powershot S2, just in case... However, so far (three months of use) I have found that the rechargable batteries have given me more than enough juice for downloads and projection on tv. I also find the transformer quite heavy and bulky--not something you would normally carry in your cameraq case."
3,not what I thought it was......,"I mistakenly thought this was a power charger for my camera, but it isn't. If you are trying to buy a charger for the Canon PowerShot S3/IS, they do not sell one! This is a cord to plug the camera into the wall and let the electricity power it, but it will only work while it's plugged in. The camera takes batteries, which you can get rechargeable ones to save money. Don't make the same mistake I did!"
2,Was really trying to find s&h,"I couldn't find a way to determine the shipping & handling for this item and wound up ordering it. I haven't received it yet, 9/5/10."
2,Poor Choice,"Bought this for a Canon S2 IS. Works fine; but it's heavy and cumbersome because of the two-part cord with the transformer in the middle. I won't be travelling with this. A couple of years ago I bought an adapter from Digipower for another camera. It is light, compact, and cheap. Wish I'd tried to get a clone adapter for this camera too."
2,Better priced alternatives,"If you carefully search (via Google) you can find a ""7.4V 2A CA-PS700"" for your Canon camera for $8.95 with free shipping. It is identical to the Canon labeled product. I generally buy from Amazon, but Canon's price is simply too high for this item. I have purchased the item and it works great for 20% of the cost of the identical Canon adapter."
5,Terrific Train Set for Young and Old,My grandson loved this train set. I started with a simple figure eight and four cars. I bought these cars shortly after Christmas to add to his set and have continued to add to it each holiday and birthday. It's extremely durable and will last through more than one child. Easy to assemble and the cars stay on the track unlike the plastic tracks and cars. Well worth the investment you make.
5,Superb,"This cookbook is a great history cookbook. It has been meticuously researched. There are original recipes from every era in America History- Indian recipes from before the Pilgrims landed, recipes during prohibition and so on. The commentary that goes with each recipe helps to put the recipe in its historical context and provides an overview for what was going on at the time. It is interesting reading and fun to try these recipes. The directions are clear and most of the recipes do not require unusual ingredients. Additionally the end results are usually pretty good.This is an excellent book for homeschoolers hoping to put a new twist on history and teaching about people of the past. This is also a great resources for the cooks who have every other cookbook on their shelves.Enjoy."
1,Latino Hanson,"I have honestly never heard of RBD until i saw them on the top of the charts, after that i checked out there albums and all i can say is; yuck, LATINO HANSON!"
2,REBELS,I DON'T LIKE IT AS MUCH AS THE SPANISH SONGS. BUT IT PASSES.THEY SHOULD ONLY STAY SINGING SPANISH SONGS. BUT ITS A NICE CD.
2,DON'T BUY THIS CD IF YOU LOVE RBD....,"...Because after hearing these songs you will start to hate them! The lyrics don't sound right at all! They couldn't have found somebody whose first language was English to translate for them? And Dulce's voice, which was only moderately annoying in Spanish, is grating in English. Especially with her heavy accent!As a matter of fact, everyone has an annoying accent (duh, 'cause their first language is Spanish). I can hardly understand what they're trying to say so I look up the lyrics and it's just a bunch of gobbledegook. The only reason why I'm giving them two stars is for trying. They tried, but they failed. I really do love RBD, I just love them in Spanish."
4,Satisfied Customer,"I recently purchased Print Shop 21 from Amazon.com. Having shopped the item, I decided on Amazon.com because I could count on their standing behind their product if there was a problem.I chose Print Shop 21 because I had used Print Shop 22 previously and was pleased with it. When I received the item (in a timely manner) I downloaded it and had a ""problem"" printing both sides of a greeting card.I contacted Amazon.com and they were quick to say I could return it at any time. I did learn my error in printing both sides and did keep my Print Shop 21. The person I communicated with - Shane with Bargain Basement - could not have been more accommodating.It was because of on-time delivery, good packaging, being in A-1 condition, and Shane of the Bargain Basement having a wonderful attitude and communication skills- that I would quickly return to Amazon.com for my next purchase."
4,The Heart and Soul of an Intro Course,"Every year, I'm asked to review a multitude of introductory psychology texts for use in my classrooms. As a result, I have sampled and used several texts in my 10+ years of teaching at the community college level.I've always like Sternberg's style, and his approach to presenting material in different ways to try to match students' particular learning styles. This text is a pared down version of his main intro book, but does not suffer from this treatment. I find it palatable, and my students report it as easy to use, easy to understand, and at least moderately entertaining. It's hard, when bombarded by the huge array of research and theory that exist in psychology today, to know what to keep in, and what to leave out. Sternberg has a good recipe, for a lovely, leavened bread of learning."
1,Dude,"I think I hated it moreso because it was a psychology book. so not my favorite subject. but, if you like psychology and understanding the mind, by all means, get this!"
1,TERRIBLE,"DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER. This girl never shipped the product. I wasted time, money, and my grades suffered because of it. Thank you for nothing. I would have given her a ""0"" star if i could have, she gave me nothing but grief."
4,Men Were Deceivers Ever- Veryan,Hard to find book by a favorite author. Good condition and reasonable price. Got it in good time and have it read already!
2,Nothing Special,I thought this movie tried to be a lot like Seven. It saw the killer almost go to super human or ridulous lengths to be ultra crazy or ultra creepy. In the end it really didn't end up being anything special at all and I felt like I had seen this movie before. Defoe is good in his role and the rest of the cast was pretty good though Mick Foley proved only with a few lines that he is no actor. Not a great movie and really not that good either.
4,A garage band with roots,"This is a band that has done their homework. To me - at least - a lot of todays so called ""Garage Bands"" sound like they listened to a couple of cds from 60's &/or 80's new wave bands, they just don't have much bases to draw from. The Charms sound like a band that really loves this kind of music.cdbaby has new copyies the bands 3 CDs."
1,French,"if you're planning on reading it in french, I woudl recommend that you buy the full version, not the ""extraits"""
2,Tired and Outdated,"For years, this and Tim Pat Coogan's book on the IRA stood as the only significant volumes on the subject. Both Bell and Coogan have kept their books in print by issuing ""revised"" versions every few years. The truth is, neither book was very good to begin with, though Bell's journalism and craftmanship is slightly ahead of Coogan's sloppy, slapdash approach. They both suffer from a similar problem - they seem to be written from a great distance from the subject, more like a series of newspaper reports than a thoughtful, fully realized nonfiction book. Bell's book (or Coogan's for that matter) can't hold a candle to Ed Maloney's ""Secret History of the IRA,"" which is, quite simply, the definitive account of the IRA, especially in its analysis of Gerry Adams and the Peace Process."
4,Great live Zappa from the late '70s period,"This two disc set is a great addition to the Zappahiles collection and not a bad primer to Zappa music in general. A good selection of cuts from the late '70s touring band while they were in Europe. The band is outstanding (even for a Zappa band)and you get plenty of the Zappa guitar fire on cuts like ""Andy"", ""Inca Roads"", and ""Watermelon In Easter Hay."" While not the best of live Zappa, the arrangements are great on the tunes and it covers a very under-documented period of live Zappa. I would recommend this because even at its worst it is great live music and many of Zappa's best tunes are available here in arrangements unique to the period."
5,Excellent and timely,This book is an excellent presentation and reference for those interested in the process meatllurgy and chemistry of gold and other precious metals. It is expertly researched and written and brings together a body of information that was previously available in only fragmented parts.
3,slow result,"The temperature rises much slower than I thought, so I need to wait for long time to see the actual temp. My oven setting temp and this thermometer's temp never match, so I don't know which is correct.The shipping package was bad, the thermometer's stand and hook part were squeezed and bended, but the material was very thin, so I could correct them."
4,Just what I was looking for!,I like to keep a thermometer in my oven to monitor the true temp. I have recently moved and needed a new one. This is perfect! Hangable and eaily seen from the window.
2,Broken after a few months...,"Thermometer worked fine for a few months and then broke completely. It stopped in the middle of the dial so I thought the oven was completely wrong, until I noticed that the thermometer hadn't moved."
1,slow reaction to temp changes- mine stopped working after a few weeks,I was disappointed with this product. It's very slow to adjust to temperature changes and mine stopped working after a few weeks of use.
4,"Works, at least I'm pretty sure it works","It's funny, you buy a thermometer because you're curious if things are cooking at the temperature you want them to & the dial moves, so you assume the temperature is correct.I'm a little less convinced in my abilities as a cook, but this thermometer seems to do just fine. I can tell that it varies a bit based on where in my oven I place it. But, who knows.One down side is that the paper inside the gauge face browned after one use."
1,Worth about a penny,"This is the second Taylor product I have bought over the last two years or so. They both failed miserably. The oven thermometer lasted only a few weeks before registering nothing at all. The BBQ thermometer was disappointingly slow from the beginning, and failed to work at all after the first season. I hate to write a negative review about anything, but I felt compelled to do so in this case."
4,Good and accurate but..,"It is a good thermometer as Taylor always is- but in the middle of oven hung under a shelf, I would prefer a larger display (more like the display on the freezer thermometer- where the light is better than in an oven)and it has a nice big display."
1,Was great while it lasted...,"I loved this, until it stopped working. This is a simple device, you'd think they would be able to make one that didn't fail after a couple months of use."
4,Useful but can get in the way,"The only problem we have is that when racks are close together in the oven and we've filled the top rack, this has no place to go (can't hang down as the rack below is too close)."
4,does what it needs to do.,only downside is that the little hook on top does not stay on the oven rack very well (I keep knocking it off when I put something in or out of the oven).
1,Mine was Defective,The unit I received was defective and read 125 degrees in a 70 degree room. The needled was loose inside the housing. Sent it right back. I'll try another brand.
4,Great price for a much used item,"I like the large size so I can clearly read the numbers through the oven door. I now know that my oven runs about 25 degrees hotter than the dial says. I like how you can hang it or let it set right on the baking stone on it's large base. I also like how I can check if my oven is fully up to temperature before I put in a dish. It is a little bit light and sort of flimsy, so I worry that I will break it fairly easily. A good buy, though, for sure."
2,Worked. For awhile.,Now it sits at 600 all the time. Just not durable enough to last being kept in the oven and forced to measure the temperature for more than a few months. Evidently I got a super durable one that lasted 10 months. 6 seems to be the going rate.
1,Might as well burn your money,"This thermometer worked. Once. And I'm not even sure how accurate it was that one time.I needed a thermometer in order to know the temperature in my oven and figured, ""why not buy the cheap one."" Now I know why not. It's a waste of time and money."
1,Horrible Junk,"Worked one time, then got locked at 320 degrees and will not register anything but that temperature, even at room temp. Garbage."
1,Oven thermometer,"It only worked a couple of times, I bought it to calibrate my oven. It fell over on the rack and now it does not work."
1,Did not last.,It quit working. It no longer registers any temperature. It is now a trash item. It was hardly used before it failed.
2,Thermometer,This would be a good thermometer if it wasn't clouded up inside. It is totally useless to me and I am going to throw it away. A total waste of my money.
1,Pain in the ass to use...,"Gets very dirty, very fast- and CONSTANTLY falls off rack and can't read it- get any other brand but one that is easy to read and reliable."
1,Useless junk,"This thermometer is off by over 50 degrees, rendering it completely useless. The 'Precision' in this product's name is a joke - it is anything but precise."
1,disappointed,"it has stopped working and has clouded over. It did work fine initially and served its purpose, but does not have a long lifespan. I would like a replacement."
4,"Easy to read, better baking, but a bit tipsy","My oven is between 25 - 50 degrees hotter than the oven dial markings according to this thermometer. Now that we've lowered the temp, general baking (turkeys, roasts, pizzas, breads, etc.) times are in line with what recipes call for. In fact, our most recent Thanksgiving turkey was cooked *perfectly* to rave reviews by our guests; prior to the temp compensation, the turkey thighs would always be undercooked or the breast meat overcooked. The product seems well made and easy to read. My only gripe is that it is a bit ""tipsy"", a larger base would be helpful. Hard to beat the price / performance of this thermometer!"
1,innacurate junk,"Same story as their ""food service"" refrigerator therms, buyer beware. In my higher end KitchenAid oven this therm shows 200 when the oven is set at 350. I'd be pretty surprised if the internal is that far off. Junk."
3,"Not that big, kinda slow","The description of this thermometer is a bit misleading. It says ""the face is 3 1/4 inches"". The thermometer is actually 3 1/4"" wide (and 4 1/4"" high) and the face (the white part) is 2 3/4"" (which is plenty big enough to read through the oven window).The thermometer is rather slow. It takes 5-10 minutes to 'get to' the temperature. I don't expect it to be instant, but 10 minutes seems a bit much.Also, the packaging doesn't tell you that just because your oven is the right temp at 325, doesn't mean it will be correct at 450... Because I checked my oven at multiple temps, the slow reading became more of an issue."
1,Not worth 1 cent,This piece of crap broke in the oven during its first use; not even worth the 3 dollars and something cents I paid for it!
1,375 is a little hot for winter,"This thermometer got stuck at 375 degrees (that's 200 degrees Celsius) after one month of normal use. I guess buying this thermometer is like gambling. Divide the current number of one star reviews by the number of five star reviews. This may be the approximate probability that you will receive a crappy thermometer.Only planning on baking during the next 30 days? No problem, this is the thermometer for you!"
2,Taylor v. CDN v. Admetior,"Because the reviews on all the oven thermometers I read were so hot and cold, I decided to buy three and pick the one I liked best. The outcome of my testing: the Taylor Classic Oven Dial Thermometer lost outright because it was consistently registering 10 degrees cooler than the other two thermometers and my estimation of how my oven was actually performing. I had been guessing that my oven was off by 10 degrees and while the CDN Pro Accurate High Heat Oven Thermometer and the Kitchen Series Oven Thermometer by Admetior confirmed my suspicions, the CDN was the easiest to read so that's the one I'm going with. Also, I would highly recommend purchasing an accurate oven thermometer because more than just being off by 10 degrees, my oven was telling me it was preheated when it was still a good 25-35 degrees away. As a side note, I did like how large and easy to read the Taylor dial was."
3,Not durable,"This thermometer seemed to work, however the first time I lightly bumped it, the glass cracked. As I was removing it from the oven, the entire top glass shattered all over the oven AND my pie! Luckily I was wearing oven mits."
5,oven thermometer,"large, easy to read dial. Was cheap compared to some others, and had a bigger dial. bought to check accuracy of our oven as my wife thought the oven was reading high. Thermometer matches oven exactly, and reads consistently in several locations. So either my oven is right, or they're both wrong exactly the same. Had it about a month now and no problems."
1,Great if you like GROUND COFFEE!,DON'T ORDER! They'll send you GROUND COFFEE!!! And they don't respond to emails or return requests. If you're expecting BEAN COFFEE YOU'LL BE SORRY
4,Great smooth coffee,We got hooked on Costa Rican coffee while visiting and are glad we can order it in the states. We actually purchased a bunch at a grocery store in Costa Rica to bring back and when that ran out I was glad to see that we could still get it on-line.
2,Not a light roast,"This was disappointing. Someone should define light roast or standardize the roasting process.,"
2,Iron Covers too loose,The first day I used these Iron Cover several of them fell off while walking and ended up loosing 2 of them somewhere on the course.
5,Great Map,"We bought this map and the ""Eyewitness.."" map of Rome. The ""Let's Go.."" was preferred by the group - more detail, easier to read. Both maps lack up-to-date info on the expanded metro, so be sure to get a paper map also when you arrive."
1,waste money and time,"follow instruction 100%, waited for one week. Not working at all, tried again many times and still same result. Save your money for food better. Don't make the same mistake like I did."
3,Okay,"This book was a last minute purchase and was an older edition of the book I truly needed. It was not usuable for the class I was taking. However, I was able to donate to the library"
3,Good Dictionary,The only caveat is that this isn't a reciprocal dictionary (ie-it doesn't offer translations from hungarian to english to complement the english hungarian translations).
2,It's a UNI-DIRECTIONAL dictionary aimed for Hungarian students wishing to speak English,"As far as dictionaries go, this is, I'm sure, great.HOWEVER, it's hard for me to judge because it's aimed at the Hungarian speaker wishing to speak English.It's a UNI-DIRECTIONAL dictionary (but is bilingual). You cannot look up Hungarian words and find their English meaning - for that you must buy the other book, Magyar-Angol (ISBN-13: 978-9630583589).I wish I had known about needing to buy the other book. I assumed that it would be bi-directional, as I have NEVER before seen a one-way dictionary.It comes with a CD for a software dictionary, but:a) the dictionary, like the book is uni-directionalb) the software in written in Hungarian which as a beginner I do not understandc) The software mentioned something about 14 days. A 2-week free trial? I must register within 2 weeks? Who knows!"
5,Outstanding In Every Way!,"There's no other way to put it than to say that this CD is flawless! How do they do it? Even the tracks that you might already have on other collections pale in comparison to the sound reproduced here. Some of the highlights here are the stereo single version of Fortuneteller by Bobby Curtola (debut), the stereo single version of First Anniversary by Cathy Carr (another CD debut), as well as CD debuts by Valerie Carr, Ed Townsend, and Cathy Carroll, and all the other tracks that will make your previous CD's obsolete. This is a must-have, for all serious collectors of the music of the first golden era of pop/rock. Bravo!"
5,Still Listening in February,"I purchased this CD for Halloween. My kids -6 &4 love it. It is still requested frequently and it's February! I will admit that we skip over some of the tracks-Twilight Zone theme- but there are enough priceless tunes -Attack of the Killer Tomatoes, The Blob, Ghost Busters, PUrple People Eater and of course Monster Mash- to make this CD well worth it."
4,Nostalgic novelties,"Rhino offers a nice collection of nostalgic Halloween novelty songs by the original artists. During Halloween, I play this CD as kids arrive at the door to trick 'r treat."
4,Halloween Hits cd,"The children ages 5 and 8 enjoyed the music on the Halloween Hits cd. They knew only some of the songs like the one from Ghostbusters. However, they enjoyed all the songs even if they had never heard them before."
3,I put a spell on you is not Screamin Jay Hawkins,"Something went wrong with the credits for this song on this CD I believe. That is not Screamin Jay Hawkins doing ""I put a spell on you."" Someone with a better ear than I needs to listen to it, but I think that is actually Howlin Wolf (the great Blues Singer from the Chess Records days), who I believe wrote the song in the first place.So just in case someone is looking for the Screamin Jay Hawkins version of this song ... this is not it. Makes me wonder if the artist who is doing it, got his royalties. :)"
1,Great Halloween CD,I received this product the next day as requested and it turned out to be a favorite. I used it at a Halloween party I had for my Godchildren and they absolutely loved all the songs. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good Halloween CD.
5,Fun Halloween Party Music,"I ordered the CD for our Halloween Party at our Senior Club, the songs were a bit of nostalgia for some of our members! A fun CD for Halloween Parties!"
5,Best Halloween Music I've Found,I've bought quite a few Halloween music CDs for parties. This is by far the best I have found. Most of the other CDs have poor remakes of the classics. This CD has the original recordings. I highly recommend it for any Halloween party. (I just wish there was a Halloween Hits 2 with additional songs!)
3,"Good, not Great, Halloween CD","This is a good Halloween CD. My favorites are ""Monster Mash"", ""Haunted House"", ""Ghostbusters"", ""The Purple People Eater"", and ""The Adams Family"". Four of the remaining songs are somewhat tolerable. They are ""The Blob"", ""I Put a Spell on You"", ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"", and ""Martian Hop"". ""Twilight Zone"" is out of place and probably shouldn't have been put on this CD. It's pretty strange and impossible to dance to. Overall, I'm satisfied with it, but not blown away."
3,Entertaining film . . . Not so great presentation.,"The film involves a mythological hero-type (Colossus), much like Hercules, who saves a group of citizens when their primitive island sinks into the sea after a series of volcanic eruptions, landslides and earthquake.They set sail on a raft and face perils at the hands of a brutal bunch in some other far away land.I really like this film. It has a ""prehistoric"" feel to it much of the time.Kirk Morris is good as the hero and there are many attractive ladies as well.I purchased this DVD hoping that the presentation would surpass my old Sinister Cinema version but, unfortunately, such is not the case.The picture quality is very soft.If you have never seen the film but like this sort of adventure, it is well worth buying.It is an excellent escape from the modern-day, politically-correct, dullard 21st Century.(I'd give the film and story 5 stars.)"
2,Terri,"I was looking for to this sandal to go with my outfit that also a zebra print. But these sandals run very narrow, so if you have a wider foot they may not work for you.I had to send mine back."
4,Cute and very comfortable.,"Great looking shoe. They are very thin but super soft and very comfortable. I bought them for my 15year old daughter but have worn them several times to take out the trash and such. I just loved them. Now Im gonna buya pair of my own. Also, just pop them in the washer and they come out looking brand new! A bit pricey but to be expected from the name brands."
4,Best cheap flip-flops,"I don't wear flip-flops, but there are places like beaches and pools where they're a necessary item. These flip-flops surprised the heck out of me. They have arch support. They're comfortable. They don't fall off of your feet or try to strangle your toes. My back didn't hurt after wearing them. They're cheap, it's worth trying them out. Do make sure to follow the sizing chart though, because I'm usually a 6.5 but these 7s fit."
3,Nice but inadequate,"As nice as the flip-flops are, the biggest problem is they were not made for wide feet. The color, style, and construction are good. They are pretty, but completely inadequate -- unless someone has a flip-flop stretcher so they will accommodate a slightly wider than narrow foot."
2,Very disappointed -- too thin & narrow,"I was so excited when I purchased these & got them in the mail. I'd hear such good things about 'Reef' flips flops... but when I put them on, my heart sank. These flip flops are so narrow & the soles are so thin that the sides of my feet literally touched the ground. (Notably, I don't wear wide shoes.) Ugh! I had to send them back. I'm not ordering anymore 'Reefs.' I much prefer Sanuk or Yellow Box flip flops over these by far. Don't waste your money people."
4,Entertaining,"Jean Ainley, a caterer, while doing her job comes across one murdered man. While trying to make ends meet, listen to sister in law and brother bicker, and teach several young girls how to cater, she begins to find clues to the identity of the killer.It isn't until the end when another attempted murder and a possible lawsuit brings it all into the open about who the murderer is and the motive.The end is good. I rated it a four stars because Jean mostly just stumbles on the answer rather than really trying to find the answer to the question: Who is the murderer? In fact, she's not even thinking about the whole thing, nor is she even putting any of the clues she has together. So it really isn't a detective book. It rather a book about a caterer who stumbles across a body and who stumbles across a murderer.However, it is still an entertaining little book.Enjoy"
4,you're gonna need these...,"You're gonna need these, if you're clumsy like me you'll find everything under the sun (including your socks) stuck to the SUPER STICKY paper. Before you know it, there'll be loose change, lint, reciepts, et al stuck to the trap and you're gonna need to replace the paper. It's worth it, because believe it or not, when free of such debris the sticky paper actually works and catches a good number of fleas, and the occasional mosquito. Enjoy!"
3,????????????????????????????,Not sure what to say.... Either they don't or or I did not have a problem. -Rescued two 3 week old kittens. Had the kittens in my house for 3 days before finding out they were ENTIRELY INFESTED. You could see the fleas jumping on and off them) had the kittens treated at a vet before finding them a home elsewhere. Nervous that my house/ the area that I kept them might have gotten contaminated I purchased this. I followed the directions and at the end of two weeks the only thing that it trapped was a house fly.
3,Works Okay,"It's hard to tell if this is the best product on the market just due to the fact that one cannot tell if a trap has captured all the fleas or just some of the fleas. We have seen fleas caught in the trap and it's rather easy to use. That being said, we have also used other products along with this one for maximum results."
1,never got this,"never got this order said it was out of stock,y am i be ask this and being sent this e-mail?"
3,These are expensive everywhere - but work wonderfully!,"These refills are too expensive for what they are, but this was the cheapest I had found them. They work AMAZINGLY WELL - in the flea traps. Managed our problem rapidly and without chemicals. AWESOME."
5,Awesome,We had such a bad flea problem last year so we set this down in the trap and it caught a lot. It's a good way to judge how under control the flea population is.
4,I panicked and bought these,"My wife and I panicked. One of our cats got out and rolled around in the grass this summer, few weeks later we found a flea.... we fogged, sprayed, took the cats to the vet for a ""dip"" frontlined them and last but not least bought these things. After launching the all out war on the fleas I put these out, they are a light bulb above a sticky pad basically, I put one in every room of the house and on the first day I caught one flea. He must have been the last of his kind because it was the last one we seen, cats are flea free as is the house. I don't know if these would work on a full blown infestation but they managed to lure out the one remaining hold out from my basement so it can't be too bad."
5,Flea trap refills,Works great with the trap. Fleas are attracted to the heat and when they land on the flea trap refill they can't escape.
5,mother,"love, love, love this product and my children does also. Just with 2 minutes of setting down the traps there were about 5 fleas on it. Then left is over night and there were about 50+."
2,Victor Flea Trap,"This trap did not attract fleas like I had expected. The bulb burnt out in less than a week. I had this trap close to the dog beds. After 2 weeks it had only 2 fleas it. I have 5 dogs and 2 cats and they all have fleas, in spite of monthly applications of Advantage. I also ordered another brand when I bought this. It was placed on another floor, and caught about a dozen fleas in the same 2 week period. Simple pie pans with soap water and a desk lamp caught more during this same 2 week test. It is not as neat looking, but does a better job."
3,"It did catch fleas BUT,","It did catch fleas.I'm sure this flea trap kept the fleas off my dog since i had it near his sleeping area. It only caught 4 fleas but i know the carpet powder help and my flea problem wasn't as bad to catch more. i used carpet powder and spray and this trap i just wanted to get rid of the fleas. I was very upset because one of the glue trap refills was dirty from the bottom like if someone ate pizza and grabbed it with their dirty greasy hands , it had oil stains with red on, it must of been a returned or someone just wasn't careful enough to pack it. That is why a give it 3 stars."
2,Gimmick / toy / etc,This device might have some beneficial application for someone somewhere but not so much for me. It is a very cheap plastic bowl with a small night light bulb that screws into the top. Adhesive paper is placed inside. Fleas are attracted to the light and the warmth. The fleas hop into the bowl and get stuck on the sticky paper.I caught between 30 and 50 fleas before the bulb burned out(three days after purchase) in my unit. The same amount of money could have been better spent on some permethrin based insecticide.This is more of a gimmick or a toy. I knew that ahead of time but I like gadgets so I bought one. I am disappointed that the manufacturer didn't at least use a higher quality bulb in the flea trap.My advice is not to buy this device. Your money will be better spent on some quality insecticide.
3,Flea Traps,They don't work as good as it says...I would not buy this product again...It does not control fleas or other bugs like it says...It is a waste of money...Don't buy this!
5,Works,It works. Caught several adult fleas already! I wish they can have a similar product but using battery. So I can use it in my car.
3,Collected alot of bugs but no fleas,Still trying to get rid of our flea infestation....its been a slow process but continuing to try the flea traps.
4,"Love it, but have to keep paws out!!!","I love it. It not only catches fleas, it catches flys, spiders, ants, Etc.The only I don't like is that there's too much wide open space between the plastic slats, which makes it easy access to extremely curious cats. They love to stick their paws in it, which sticks to the cats also. Just put baby oil on kitty's paws to get him/her unstuck. This is the reason I can only give it 4 stars. If it had more slats in it so little paws can't get in, I'd rate it 5 stars. I think I'll email Victor, and make the suggestion. To solve this problem, I place the trap approx. 6 inches off the floor on a little plastic container. I hope this helps. I recommend it to everyone."
2,Cheap design,"I understand that this is not an expensive product, but when you get it, you will see the design is so cheesy and the package and inside of it was very dusty. It attracted bunch of bugs, so I am not sure if that means I don't have any fleas at my home or not."
1,A Gadget... That's All,"Give them your money? It does the job of collecting fleas. However, not that the product is poor, but if you've a flea problem you believe requires this gadget, I strongly recommend you consider getting rid of the fleas by flea-fogging the room or house and getting the fleas off your animal(s). I used this product out of desparation, but the end result was following my recommendation. I'm flea-free in my home, but not by using this product."
1,Useless,This product is useless unless your trying to catch moths or nats in the middle of the night. Not a single flea. Looking for another product
1,doesn't work,I used the trap for two weeks and haven't caught a single flea. I know they are around- our poor dog keeps getting infested.
5,This system really works,"This is the refill pack for the Victor Ultimate Flea trap and this system really works. I have three of these light traps in our house (and two long-haired cats). Despite the topical anti-flea drops that we put on them, and frequent vacuuming , we still get some fleas. It's impossible to get them all and the cycle continues. That's what is so great about these traps. They work day and night and catch plenty of fleas so that they don't lay eggs. I put in a new set of the glue pads every 30 days or so. Very nice."
1,Nope....,"It didn't work for me...at all, and I have a serious flea problem. I tried it in several locations, and aside from initially catching about 20 flea's that was it. For the next two days nothing else was caught, even though I could see the flea's around."
4,Victor M231 Flea Trap,Excellent product...no fleas but lots of fungus knats from plants and fruit flies trapped...please note I did bomb my home twice and treated animals as well...so far so good :-)
5,Doesn't work well without the light!,"This will trap and starv a rat or cockroach that happens to walk by, but when used with the flea trap light it's unstoppable!!"
2,Didn't catch a thing,"Maybe I didn't have anything to catch, but ...now I know for the future I don't need refills for the trap itself."
1,didn't work,"didn't catch even one flea or any other bug for that matter, really really disappointed in this product, because the brand is one I recognize as good"
2,not sure about this,"used this for a camp, seemed to not really attract any kind of bugs let alone fleas it was supposed to get, i think i would have been better off just spraying with something."
4,works great,Other bugs besides fleas get caught in the trap. Makes a great night light too. Cheaply made flimsy plastic but does the job
5,flea trap refills,excellent product. very sticky pads. really does catch fleas. highly recommended. have been using victor's products for years. reasonabley priced too.
3,Pretty Night Light,"So i have a major flea infestation when i had my litter of Corgis. CORGIIIIISSSS!!!! Anyways, it caught like 20 Fleas but it didn't caught enough. Made for a good nightlight for the puppies. One time the Corgi puppies got out and one got stuck. Funniest thing ever, until he began freaking out and crying. I saved him.If you have some major fleas give it a shot. Otherwise it is a good idea to just give your dogs a bath with Dawn Dish Soap twice a week. Be sure to use conditioner afterwards otherwise your puppies skin will dry out(says my vet)."
1,Use the money as kindling for the fireplace instead,"One of the worst investments I have ever made. No fleas caught, but there is a bright side---it makes a great night light."
3,Seems ok,"I am not sure how bad my flea problem is, but I have seen a couple fleas on the pads. So it must work."
2,"Good in theory, not in reality",I purchased this item in addition to the actual trap by reading the reviews posted here on Amazon. The users must have had a much larger flea infestation than I as it took over a week to get 20 fleas. I used the trap in the area that the dogs sleep with no other light than the one on the trap. I know the dogs had fleas as I could see them. Maybe the fleas were smarter than the trap.
1,Do not waste your money,"I bought 3 of the Flea Traps, and 3 packs of the refills. Total waste of money. Fleas are jumping on me but yet none in the traps. So if you want a product to get rid of Fleas don't buy this one."
2,Good news - bad news,"I was hopeful that this flea trap would be just the thing - no toxic sprays - bug balms etc but plugged it in and nothing!Not one flea was caught - as a matter of fact - nothing was caught so I can assume either two things.........It doesn't work or I don't have any fleas and all the ""stuff"" I used to get rid of them (beforhand) killed them off."
1,Completely useless !!!,Doesn't work! Waste of money ! It's a lightbulb and flypaper. You're better off with a room fogger and spray !
4,Really Does Work,This can serve both as a night light and also does really work for fleas. For some reason the fleas and other insects are attracted to the bright light and then get stuck on the sticky paper. Ingenious idea and does help to rid your carpet of fleas. Buy the unit once and then just keep purchasing re-fill sticky paper as needed.I'll keep buying them.
5,works terrific,"I've used these for 4 years. Just can't seem to get rid of fleas, but these work great. I use a few of them as I open my windows and no matter how tiny the holes in your screens are, they get in and also come in on my family as well. They work better at night when the house is dark as fleas tend to gravitate to the light. It's amazing how many they catch, one refill lasts a very long time as the surface is large compared to the size of a flea and it remains sticky. The only other alternative would be to bring my chickens in to take care of the problem, but then there's a different problem to deal with. If my town zoning law allowed my chickens to wander, my flea and tick problem would virtually disappear."
5,Worked very well for us!,"If the directions for use are followed, this works very well - in a dark room, where there's little activity. Especially in combination with Advantix (or another, just not Hartz - that stuff is dangerous) flea and tick drops for the pet. My son and I made it a math game (he loves math) for him to keep track of how many fleas were found each morning, added to the previous flea count. Even during daytime and evening with the lights on, if there's no one in the room so the fleas don't jump on you instead, fleas would jump in. Not in hordes, thank goodness, but it did help to clear the fleas from the floor and furniture without having to use stinky powders or chemicals. I would recommend this!!"
5,Really good product.,These little glue traps work great. You can tell by the number of fleas it captures and kills.The glue traps work because of the number of fleas it traps; the traps turn almost black with the number of fleas that it captures.
3,It does catch fleas,I was looking for a natural method to catch fleas and this works with just light and sticky paper. But it doesn't solve the complete problem and you will probably need at least 2 per room.
1,not so much,"It doesn't seem to work so good! I put it in the room with two of my dogs and had one flea on the trap. It stayed by the kennel for two days only a few bugs.... i washed the dogs, they were covered in fleas. Ugh"
5,No more daddy's little girs,"First of all this book is excellent for pre-teens. What I like most about the book is kids being able to share their feeling, and their problems with each other; they look out for each other through good and bad times. There is nothing like growing up with childhood friends and becoming lifetime friends."
4,Great choice for the big-band fan!,"According to the liner notes, many of the songs on this CD were written by amatuers in the 40s, who entered Tommy Dorsey's radio contest. Apparently as this time, there was a dispute with ASCAP and no songs written by ASCAP members could be played on the radio. So Tommy Dorsey solicited his audience members to submit their own best efforts. This represents the best of the lot. Some clearly better than others, but all refreshingly new. Lots of backup vocals by the Pied Pipers with Frank's young and silky voice. This was all recorded live, so there are a few bloopers from the band, but all in all, a very enjoyable CD - well worth the price."
4,Tasty filling Low cal soup,"For those of you who do weight watchers, a WHOLE can of this stuff is only 2 points. Its VERY filling, and very tasty.My only complaint is that Amazon does a lousy job of packing any of its canned goods. Their packing materials end up flattened by the time the product gets to you, and the tins of soup or whatever, dented.I HAVE noticed that after much bitching at them about this over the past year that I've been a regular grocery shopper with them, just this week a new option has popped up in the page where we check our shipments, to complain specifically about their packing.Otherwise this is a GREAT low cal, tasty filling soup that is impossible to find in the US because its more of a traditional british food than something Americans are familiar with. The only other place I've found it is british speciality shops, and at twice the price."
3,3 stars as only 8 out of 12 cans weren't damaged.,"The soup is good but 4 of the 12 cans were so dented that I threw 2 away as they were so damaged I was afraid they might be contaminated. I'm still considering what to do with the other 2 dented cans..The shipping carton had no visible marks, dents, or scratches, and the inner package had no visible signs of damage..the center four cans were dented but not the outer cans..I think they were packaged that way...just wanted to warn you of what you might receive if you order a case of this soup."
3,disappointed,"While the outside cans appeared fine, every can on the inside of the case was dented...some very badly...we feel this is a great deal that we'd give a 5 star rating if the cans were undamaged."
4,Eye-opening!,"I never realized how much I didn't know about Washington politics. Many of us tend to let the days go by, assuming anything that happens in the White House has no relevance to us. Wrong! Read this book and you'll be both amazed and disheartened at how our nation's leaders are mis-managing this country. Clinton wasn't the only one who cheated; our elected officials are cheating on America every day. Fortunately, there are people like David Schippers who have the guts and integrity to tell it like it is. Hopefully, those of us who are lackadaisical about politics (I know I was) will take this book as a wake-up call."
1,Schippers is a typical prosecutor,"Once he gets identifies ""side"" (the side paying him the money, i.e. the Republican caucus in this case), he simply cannot see the other side of an issue. I understand the concept of zealous prosecution, but Schippers statement that ""any sitting President who lies about anything should be impeached"" is a fundamental misunderstanding of the Constitution.Schippers presents his own points of view cogently, if rather dryly. But he absolutely fails to see the other side. Fails to understand that good people could disagree with him for good reasons. Anyone who disagrees with his point of view is dubbed ""without morals"" or a ""sellout."" This is NOT a balanced view. It's the Prosecutor's view, of why he shouldn't have lost his case."
2,Another Clinton-bashing screed from Regnery,"As Gomer Pyle would say, ""Surprise, surprise, surprise!"" Another dead tree's worth of Clinton-bashing from Regnery, which has published innumerable steaming piles of it in the past, including ""Hell to Pay,"" wingnut Barbara Olson's harpy-like screed against Hillary Clinton. ""The most corrupt President in American history."" Yeah, right. How quickly we have forgotten the Reagan/Bush regime and their arms-for-hostages deals? Has anyone ever bothered to wonder why Bush the Edler pardoned Caspar Weinberger and a half dozen of his CIA cronies in connection with the Iran-Contra scandal? Because by doing so, he was guaranteeing that they wouldn't point the finger at him! THAT, my friends, is corruption. The whirling wingnuts still haven't figured out that Bill Clinton is no longer a candidate as they attempt to do whatever it takes to install themselves in the White House to continue the failed policies of their God, Ronald Reagan."
1,Is this partisan politics or ignorance?,"Ever since Reagan looked into our cameras and said ""I did not sell arms to Iran,"" America has, sadly, accepted outright lying by our Presidents. Clinton, about Lewinsky (and, come on, other matters), but Republicans about SELLING WEAPONS TO OUR ENEMIES (Iran)FOR PRIVATELY RUN WARS(Contras), to which Bush Sr. was a party. Neither Reagan nor Bush was ever impeached -- indeed, Reagan continues to be idolized. And now this supposed ""Democrat"" supposedly ""goes against his party"" to ""reveal"" the behind-the-scenes Clinton-impeachment scandals! Get serious."
1,Makes me want to vote for Gore,"I just finished reading this book cover to cover. It is full of conspiracy theories and accusations. Interesting how it is published right before the election Seriously, I have been a Bush supporter because of the stands and values that Govenor Bush advocates.However, when I read a book like this, which is blatantly a ""dirty trick"" of my party (Republican), even I can see the hypocrisy. I have decided (although somewhat reluctantly) to vote for Gore and Lieberman. There seems to be more integrity on that side."
2,The Inside Story of a Delusion,"Schippers in this book appears convinced that one ought to be able to impeach a president based upon secret evidence stored in a secret evidence room. He waxes indignant at the unwillingness of Senators to travel to the House's secret evidence room to view such evidence.He never explains why such evidence was not presented when the House controlled the process. As an attorney, surely Schippers knows that we do not convict defendants of crimes in this country based upon secret evidence in secret evidence rooms. What was he thinking?This book doesn't go far enough into the mental processes of Schippers and other impeachment supporters. He never displays any self-doubt, even now that impeachment has failed. We never know how he would answer the objections of the President's attorneys and others that we do not convict of crimes in America based on secret evidence."
1,I can taste the fish oil - FESS UP!,"It's no mystery that this peanut butter tastes like fish, they must add fish oil to get the Omega 3's up. I have to check when I get home, but if that's not listed in the ingredients, that's REALLY BAD! FOR SHAME. But read further, I will convince you of my sincerity.*What really turns me off is the fake reviews that are obvious answers to the honest ones. I might have given it 2 or 3 stars if I felt like the truth was out there, but people need to know why it scores low.*The strange thing is, I have a creamy PB from Smart Balance w/1000mg omega 3's, and it doesn't taste like fish, it's better homogenized, and there's no oil rolling around the top. It would still bother me to find that there was fish in it, since they do not claim it in the ingredients, but I can vouch for it's non-fishy taste, and will even provide the link - [...]It doesn't have OMEGA written in large letters under the name."
4,Good natural flavor,"Peanuts are not sweet unless sugar is added. This is good peanut butter, it does not separate and tasted like fresh roasted nuts. I have had peanuts straight from the field and oven roasted them, this is just as good. The slight sweetness from the molasses makes it my all time favorite. The bad part is the cost."
1,tastes like fish oil,This tastes like eating fish oil capsules which is quite repulsive. I don't know how the managed to do this as it has sunflower and flax oil neither of which taste fishy to me.
1,Tastes fishy,"I love the nutritional benefits of this product, but the taste is awful. It has a fishy flavor. I've eaten plenty of natural peanut butters that have great taste, but this one is just gross."
1,The worst-tasting peanut butter I've ever tried!,"I really wanted to like SMART BALANCE OMEGA Natural Peanut Butter...but it was just AWFUL. I took two spoonfuls to try it, but it tasted horribly fishy. I wrote to SMART BALANCE to state my opinion, and they never replied -- not even with an apology or another recommendation for a different product. I wasted my money on this peanut butter. Do yourself a favor, and don't buy it. There are better natural peanut butters out there. Try Whole Foods or Trader Joe's brands. Those are good."
5,Forza Firenze,"The re-release of Magdalene Nabb's Florentine stories is long overdue ( and shame on her UK publisher for dropping her ).Congratulations are due to SoHo Press for their continuing ressucitation of some of the finest crime writers ( Van Der Wetterring , Tokagi and Janes etc )who all seem to have been dropped in favour of half-witted serial killer clones.These are some of the finest crime stories ever written and their evocation of Florence is flawless.Marshal Guarnaccia is one of the most engaging protagonists since Maigret and the stories have a similar emphasis on the observation of character and cause rather than Chritie-esque puzzles.In many ways the mystery seems secondary to Ms. Nabb's exceptional ability to draw the reader into the lives of her characters and the bustle of Florentine daily life.Buy three copies, one to read and re-read to destruction , one to keep for the time when your first falls to bits and one to give to your best friend.Brava Signora !"
4,The Marshal Guarnaccia series,"This series focuses on the texture of the neighborhood and the culture. These books are to savor, like a slow Italian meal. Plot? Also slow, but satisfying. Like good fruit for dessert, not tiramisu."
4,Clever introduction of a main character,The device used to delay entry of the Marshal into the case is clever and unprecedented.
3,Italian flavor? Not much.,"Having really enjoyed Camilleri's Montalbano books, I was hopeful about this, especially after seeing such good reviews. I was greatly disappointed. The mystery itself was all right, although the red herrings were rather expected, but it was the feel of the story which was the greatest disappointment. Rather than having an Italian, much less Florentine, flavor permeate the story, I felt as if the author visited for local color and presented details without substance. Marshall Guarnaccia was barely in the story much of the time, and I got no feel for his personality or quirks. It was the English characters who had the most life, and that wasn't what I was looking for.The Terra-Cotta Dog: An Inspector Montalbano Mystery"
5,Searching For Sarah,"Wow - I am glad that I read this book before I read these reviews. I could not dissagree more with the first reviewer.I was rivited for 31/2 straight hours of purly enjoyable reading. The Characters along with the signature Lynn Erickson setting and plot were incredibly put together, keeping my full attention for the lenghth of the book.My only complaint with this book, as with most of Lynn Erickson's work, is that I can only get 3 to 4 hours of pleasure out of the books, because I refuse to put them down until I am finished."
5,Searching for Sarah,"Lynn Erickson has done it again! Searching for Sarah is a non-stop page turner with great characters, a great romance and a super murder mystery that completely fooled me. What a ride. I couldn't put it down. A must read for all romantic suspense buffs."
2,NOT SATISFYING,"What is it about Lynn Erickson's books? I've read two of them and have come away with the same feeling. Emptiness. It's not even something I can pin down. This book has a promising beginning but then bogs down. Is it undeveloped characters? Maybe. At the end of the story (and it was hard getting to the end), you don't really care what it is. You're just glad your finished. I seem to be in the minority here so judge for yourself."
1,very poor quality,"This set was impossible to use: the numbers and letters were not centered or aligned with the flat sides of the stamp tool, so it was impossible to orient the character accurately on the work to be stamped. Properly designed stamps have the character centered, and aligned with a flat side (usually square) of the stamp tool. This set went into the rubbish rather than return it, so that it would not wind up in some unsuspecting purchaser's hands. One of the worst examples of poorly executed, cheap knock-offs. Caveat emptor."
4,I'm going with this Guy.,"""The only book on Ives worthy of it's subject, the first thorough study of Ive's music, the first biography of our greatest composer.""-Guy DavenportWinner of the MacArthur Foundation ""genius grant"" for short fiction and essays linking American civilization with traditions of classical and European culture."
2,Commercial info.,I was hoping that this would refer to home knitting machines. To my disappointment it is a review of commercial machines and their applications. I returned it to Amazon---no problem!
5,jUST A CORRECTION,"Being a Zappa fan i felt compelled to correct the moron who wrote the review before me. First of all, this is not an official Zappa release. Second of all, there are NOT ""well over 1000 albums"" put out by zappa (including bootlegs), and on top of that, Zappa was never in a car accident. he got pushed off the stage by a crazed fan in 1972 during King Kong. Also, Ralph Humphrey also appear alone on some songs on Apostrophe and all of Overnite Sensation. So before you write, try to know what your talkin about buddy. And btw, this is a great album."
5,bod spray great deodorant,"This is a great product nice smell too it, the girls love the fragrant too. My girlfriend loves it too."
1,GOOD SERVICE/BAD PRODUCT,"Discovered Bod Man Musk spray a few years back.Unfortunately they must have changed the formula. It has almost no fragranceexcept for a mild antiseptic smell. Major dissapointment,really loved the ""old"" stuff. When a company has a successful product whychange it??? Amazon.com was fast, easy and will order from site again. Just NOT Bod Man Fresh Blue Musk.Buyers Beware!"
1,What a Rip Off,"The company charged me $6 for shipping a $4 item. When I complained to the company about the shipping charges, as well as the fact that I thought the order placed contained 10 knee highs at $4 each, they told me that their standard shipping rate was $6 regardless of how many.Needless to say, I did not return the $4 item as the return postage made it not worth it.If their customer service had half a brain, they would have responded to my inquiry by correcting the order, which I thought was 10 knee highs, not 1 pair of knee highs, and, they would have offered to ship the remaining 9 w/o further postage added on to the order.I WILL NEVER USE THIS COMPANY AGAIN."
4,My Son's Thoughts on the Beginner Roadway Exp. Pack,"My son enjoys having a road for his road vehicles to drive on, instead of driving them on the carpet. He rates it 4 stars rather than 5 because he would have liked to have more road pieces. I was pleased with the amount and variety of roadway pieces, however. It is a nice addition to his Thomas set."
4,Great product!,"Great product, very kid-friendly for assembly, and reasonably indestructable for two little boys. The price on Amazon is more reasonable than in-store prices, but I feel that the product is still overpriced by about 35%."
5,thomas the train wooden train set,"bought for my grand children, most popular toy at christmas by far......."
4,Discription not complete,"This is wonderful doll, but the product description should include that this is the hispanic version of the doll. I couldn't tell from the picture. I have since learned that in the Corolle line of dolls, those that include the title ""Darling"" are the hispanic version. That's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5."
4,Michigan Memories,It was a true pleasure reading and making some of Michigan's finest recipes. I can't wait to make more for family and friends.
2,Misleading advertizing,"Unfortunately, this volume did not relate to the song and garden birds. Volume 2 discribes ""105 species of water birds, including herons and egrets, cranes, shorebirds, gulls, terns and alcids."" The tape is a VCR not the advertized DVD. I and my cat were disappointed."
4,the best voice,"I was patiently awaiting this CD and purchased it the day it was available. I've been listening to Cristian and adoring his music since ""Agua Nueva"". Things are just getting better! In ""Mi vida . . ."", he puts an incredible amount of power and soul into his voice with dramatic music and lyrics. Definately talented, with Kike on his side writing incredible lyrics. I recommend it, I would have given him 5 stars but I felt cheated to find only 10 tracks!! :("
5,Great CD!!,"This is some very romantic Music. Of course you'd enjoy it much better if you were bilingual. However, you don't need to be, in order to enjoy this Artist/CD who, in my opinion, rates right up there with the likes of Enrique Iglesias, Marc Anthony and/or Marco Antonio Solis! Don't believe me? Listen to the CD and you will know what I mean."
5,Buen disco,"Mi vida sin tu amor, volver amar, entre otras son bonitas. Recomendable para la gente que le gusta la musica romantica."
5,Cristian es Fabuloso,"Tuve el gusto de comprar el CD de Cristian, ""Mi Vida sin tu Amor"" y me parecio fabuloso. Sus canciones tan romanticas como siempre y su voz tan angelical te hacen son~ar. Definitivamente supo elejir un compositor tan aclamado como Kike Santander para este CD. Mi cancion preferida es ""alguna vez"" pero todas las otras estan hermosas. Recomiendo este CD a todos los fans de Cristian. Algo que me di cuenta es que en este CD escribieron su nombre con ""H""!!!"
3,One thing to say..,"I personally don't like Christian Castro. His voice is fairly common, his interpretation average, and until now his lyrics were not exceptional. After hearing those great songs by Alejandro Fernandez in ""Me estoy enamorando"" which were written by Kike Santander, one thing I must give credit to, is that this CD has good lyrics, because some of the songs were written by Kike. If you are a Christian fan, this CD is a must, and if you're not a Christian fan, then consider listening to the songs, only because of who wrote them. Sorry Christian fans, Alejandro is simply a better artist :)."
5,Upgrade,"Used this chip to upgrade an old IBM motherboard, D945GCNL. The old chip was a Pentium D single core. This new chip breathed some life into the system and performed much better. Now I can use this computer for another year or so until I build a totally new system."
2,Good compilation of previously published material on Bocelli,"This book has lovely photographs, is well organized and is a good resource of basic information on Andrea Bocelli for those without internet access. However, there is very little information that has not already appeared in liner notes, journal/newspaper articles and been published on several websites. The author does credit one website as her source for 28 articles used in her research. It is nice to have the information attractively packaged in an easily readable form. If you are hoping for new insights or in-depth reporting, you will be disappointed. One bothersome aspect is the blurring between quotes the author obtained directly in interviews and quotes culled from previously published material. Source citations would have been helpful."
3,Read for Power issues and support,"I have 4 external LaCie drives and I have had problems with the power supply. To the people that have returned it to LaCie I must say i am sorry that you were told to do that, if the issue is the power supply they can replace it. I have had to do this a few times and had two very nice tech support and one 16 year teenager who was rude and very bad attitude. In the last case i actually had to talk to supervisor who turned out to be his buddy.The drives themselves have been OK, but at present two of my !TB and 600GB power supplies are gone out again!Update: Feb 2009 - The power supplies were replaced by a very nice 3rd tech support lady and the drives have been working fine.I have 5 LaCies now with the oldest being 3.25 years old and still ok. My drives are always on."
1,Lacie 1TB failed in less than a year.,Computer no longer recognizes the disk when you plug in the USB cable. Now the drive just makes repetitive eeep! eeep! noises like a dying bird. Will never buy Lacie again.
1,Not reliable,"I've had a LaCie Big Disk Extreme for about 4 years now. For the first 2 years it was fine, then it started losing connectivity and shutting off. LaCie said it was a power supply problem (which I read about online as well, it's been a problem with this model) and replaced the power supply for free as a ""one time courtesy"". Six months later it started making strange sounds and losing connectivity regularly again. Customer service said it sounded like a power supply issue again, and would not replace the power supply for free again b/c I already got my ""courtesy"" free one. I bought a new one, and it didn't fix the problem. I haven't lost data yet, but I bought a new Western Digital drive and transferred everything to be safe. I no longer trust LaCie, and you shouldn't either. Backup drives are too important to have regular failures."
4,LaCie is great when it's working,"I have (2) 500gigs, (1) 200 gig - all Lacie Drives. The first 500 gig crashed and I lost everything. Luckily it was still uner a 1 year warranty and I got a new one. Unforutnatly, they erased everything and couldn't recover any data. I've heard that some of their earlier versions of the 500 gig drives did this but should be fixed. Do yourself a favor, if you value your data, go with 2 drives and back them up nightly. It's a piece of mind that's worth the price. Since that drive crashed, my other drives seem to work great. I've also tried other drives...like a Maxtor 1TB drive that I spent almost $900 on about a year ago. That drive crashed and was replaced with a new one...which just crashed again. Unfortunately, It's no longer covered under warranty. Again...BACK UP YOUR BACK UP!!!! It's the only way you'll have piece of mind."
1,500 Gig LaCie External Hard Drive,"I don't know about the 1 TB but my 500 GIG LaCie external drive crashed after a little over 1 year, with very little use. I lost all data. The cost of data reclaimation is prohibitive.I have had better luck with Western Digital units."
4,Big Tank for Scanning Workstations,"We needed to quickly extend the capacity of our image scanning workstations, and this LaCie 1 TB was plug and play as advertised. The drive is quiet and the case never seems to get hot. I do wish these things had internal rather than external power supplies."
1,Drive failed within 2 months. All data lost. Aaargh!,"I had read mixed reviews of LaCie but thought I'd give them a try. Well, my first and last time. The drive started going downhill within a couple of months. First, it wouldn't mount a partition on my Mac, then it wouldn't mount at all. In fact, it wouldn't boot up and made a sing-song buzzing noise. Support acknowledged that a drive mechanism had failed. Very helpfully recommended a data recovery service for which I would have had to pay.Why can't they make a decent product so we wouldn't have to worry about losing data? My advice: Avoid LaCie drives! There are many others to choose from."
2,Great drive. Rubbish Power Supply,"Really, Lacie have let down their engineering department by coupling their hard work with this AWFUL power supply. The web's awash with horror stories about the power supply failing. On the other hand, I found their support to be helpful in rectifying the matter. Heads need to roll at the QC department for these power supplies."
1,An expensive boat anchor,"At our professional recording studio, we've been through 4 LaCie Big Disk 1 TB external hard drives since 2007. None has lasted more than about 6 months until the last one, which hung in there for a year. They're stored in a quiet and air-conditioned machine room, alongside PC workstations that have been running for years. Everything is UPS protected. Each drive eventually fails to the point that it just makes drive-hashing noises and doesn't show up at all on the computer. I've swapped power supplies, connector cables and computers (everything in the skimpy LaCie suppport web page). They're 0 in 4.They're fine until they die. Then they're doorstops. Caveat emptor!"
5,"Great capacity, Great performance","I had a hard drive crash in november 06 and looked everywhere for back up options. After extensive research, I decided to stick with LaCie and this 1TB disk has lived up to my expectations. I've had it only for almost 2 months and has performed very well in terms of speed and reliability. Also, the vendor delivered what promised timely and accurately."
1,Low quality,"I bought three of these back in 2007, and in less than three years, the power supplies on all three have failed. I wish I'd spent a few more bucks and bought something of higher quality."
1,Lasted less than a year...,Then simply stopped working. After some additional research LaCie has a reputation for unreliable drives (which I knew ahead of time having bought LaCie drive years ago and then stopped). Typical failure rates of 40+% in under a year. Buy drives from anybody else. Fortunately all I kept on this disk were system backups and I can simply start using another disk.
1,Lasted one week,Having had problems with a previous USB drive I bought the Lacie as a replacement having been brought under the impression that it was a superior quality (and therefore more expensive) than the previous drive.It has lasted one week and after hours on the phone to the manufacturer's support line no one has a clue what the fault is.This drive and it's support team are a complete waste of time and money.
1,"Nice & rugged, but failed.","I have the 1.2 TB LaCie. Loved this thing - enough capacity to backup my other computers, rugged, ran relatively cool, nice looking. Worth the $800 that I spent in Jan 2006. And then 4 wks ago it failed, after only 1-1/2 yrs. Of course, it's no longer under warranty. Would expect better from LaCie and at this price range. (Granted, they are much less expensive now). Fortunately the drive contained only backups, so no critical data was lost."
1,Less than 2 years,"My LaCie hard drive just quit working for no reason. Clicks and clicks and no recognition any longer from my Mac. All my music is on there. Luckily, I can capture off my IPOD but I am disappointed. I read other reviews that say they have a product with a high percentage of failure. I wish I would've known that before I bought one. One should be able to expect more from a back up hard drive. It is your back up."
5,"superb, brilliant writing for an often neglected instrument","If you're like me you occasionally like to be challenged in your listening diet, and this is music that will do that. I especially enjoyed the duet--moments of somber beauty combined with some intense overblowing and multiphonics. Gubaidulina is a composer with a truly original voice, and in this recording you can clearly hear her love for the lowly bassoon. Like Ligeti and Xenakis, she values ""sound"" over ""notes""."
1,DUSTY and discolored,"This item came to me and it looks like it's either been used or hopefully it has just sat in a dusty warehouse yellowing over time. And there is red marker writing on the top, as if to be maybe an item number... very disappointed!!"
4,Good but leaks,"I use this bottle for olive oil. It does the job, but does leak a little around the base of the top. If that was corrected, it would be a perfect bottle."
5,Works great for honey,I love this bottle. I use it for honey and it works great. I'm ordering another for flavored honey and one for mustard. I had to cut the tip a tiny bit for the honey.
4,great help for small children,"This wacky track does seem rather expensive for just two pieces, but my 3.5-year-old twins couldn't build their own layouts without it, so in a sense it's invaluable. (I'm considering buying more.) We do have problems with trains falling/running off the track in general, but it isn't any worse with this kind of track unless they pull it into a really tight curve."
2,Not very durable,My 5 year old train-addict got this for Christmas. Half-way through January one of them fell apart beyond repair. All the pieces came off like beads on a string. Very disappointing for such an expensive piece.
3,Not as good as it seems,Good for joining tracks when nothing else will fit ... but longer trains generally will not stay on these tracks.
4,Helps the ends meet,"Others have said these tracks are fun, or that the cars fall off them easily. The way my son runs his trains, they always fall off - no matter what. Accidents happen is his favorite Thomas song.These tracks have the added bonus of allowing him to complete a circuit track more easily. The piece allows for sharper or gentler curves to close the circle, and makes it easier for him to make a complex complete course by himself. Which is why I love it. It does not bend as much as he would wish, but it is less frustrating than having all solid pieces around.Just my opinion.(*)>"
5,A must for any train set.,"My boys are now teenagers, but they loved playing with their wooden train set when they were little. I was always adding to their collection, to the point where the tracks covered the living room. We didn't make little oval tracks, we made huge elaborate tracks. Inevitably, we'd run into the problem of having 2 pieces of track that we couldn't figure out how to connect. Wacky Tracks to the rescue! They can connect any odd shaped gap. The train set also got a lot of use from young cousins whom I babysat weekly. We have 4 Wacky Tracks that are still in perfect condition."
4,"Solid Album, Solid Group, Worth a Listen!","'South' is one of those artists that you are either going to like, or dislike. I would not liken it to the extent that 'Boards of Canada' can segregate music listeners, but there are definitely some bits of their music that may make you shy away.'With The Tides' starts out with a bit of a slow touch and moves onto Tracks 03 and 04, which are quite strong. The albums flows well and is a very enjoyable listen for many occasions. 'Silver Sun' is also a strong track which brings a bit of a 'Beetles' feel to it.I highly recommend this album for those that like ambient music and indie (hard to use this word with them) with a bit of a post-rock feel.Favorite Tracks: Track 03, Track 04, Track 06, Track 09"
4,Must have for the South fan,"It took me a long time to get into the last South album. However, it grew on me well. In contrast, With the Tides, I liked immediately. I don't mean to say that this album doesn't also have the capacity to grow on a person - it does. You will probably immediately fall for ""Natural Disasters"" and ""Loosen Your Hold"", but on further listening, your favourites will probably fall elsewhere - ""Nine Lives"" and ""Straight Lines to Bad Lands"" inadvertantly grew on me. As mellow and personal as they are, and as difficult as it seems to be to get my friends to like this band - I love them. They are smart, subtle and everything you're used to from Coldplay and Radiohead. Branch out a little and give the lesser known British bands a listen. They're on the OC Soundtrack along with Turin Brakes - they can't be that scary!"
2,Goes nowhere very slowly,"While South has certainly tried to create a varied selection of songs, none of them seem to have any bollocks, in lieu of a better term. There is little to no excitement throughout 'With The Tides'. The sad, rainy day mood never changes during the album, making each of the similar sounding tracks seem even more so.On many tracks, such as 'Colours In Waves' 'Loosen Your Hold' and 'Same Old Story', the band layers the vocals many times over to create an unpleasing 'ghost trio' vocal. The opener, 'Motiveless Crime' is the closest you'll get to a completely intriguing piece.None of the songs are bad, but at the same time, you know you could listening to something much better.And finally, the vast majority of the album's liner notes are nearly impossible to read due to the fonts being written by the band's pet chicken."
5,Great Movie,Before I bought this movie for my girlfriend I had never seen it. Since purchasing it I have watched it at least a dozen times. This is a great family movie and I would recommend everyone to watch it at least once.
5,moving and superb,"So what if this movie is unconventional, we were all children once and used our imaginations to handle our problems and fears. Do watch this movie, it is touching, superbly acted and will probably bring a tear as it handles a common and delicate subject. I cry at the sibling bond as it touches a nerve as I remember times of solidarity with my siblings when upset. I have learnt not to listen to much to film reviews but go off the feedback from everyday people, folk that do not get backhanders to say certain things! A young and promising Elijah Wood - long may he reign"
3,Good acting. Not a child's movie.,"I feel uncomfortable when I read reviews which hail this movie as a ""childhood favorite"". It left me highly unprepared for what the movie was really about. It is a very dark movie about child abuse and how the older child dealt with it. There is a lot of violence in it, both shown and implied, and it was very scary for even me to watch. I originally borrowed it, thinking it would be a childhood movie about a couple of children who played around with flying machines. I saw those as being metaphors for how they dealt with the abuse they had to take from ""the king"", their stepfather, rather than a hobby that two young children had.The children are bullied by the neighborhood children as well as the stepfather in this movie.The acting was amazing. It will make you cry, and don't watch it if you have a weak stomach and a low tolerance for abusive situations."
2,Well Acted But Hardly A Classic,"I found the other reviews very interesting. Yes, the movie is very well acted, which is the only reason I gave it 2 stars but frankly the abuse was so horrific I found the movie barely watchable.I admit that when watching a movie I look for something to entertain & escape into. If I want reality, I'll watch CNN. For that reason, while I know child abuse exists & think it needs to be acknowledged to end it, I don't really want to watch someone hurt children (& animals). Maybe part of the reason I had such a problem with this movie was the fact that everyone talks about what a great children's movie this is. It's only appropriate if your idea of a children's movie is ""Friday the 13th"". The violence is WAY too intense to let children watch."
4,About being a boy,"The modern world needs fairy tales, too, and this one works. The story conveys a mundane magic and sense of wonder that seems impossible - until you look at the little guys around you, and see them living it out.This movie captures some of that magic. It's a hard world, too, with things in it that should never happen to any child. But, if you think that commitment and love have to wait until they grow up, you got it all wrong. These boys love their mother more than she can know, and prove it in their lives and actions. That dedication, even if mistaken, stands as one of the miracles of everyday life.In the end, boyish invention and adventure win out. It has a cost, as ""Fish"" shows near the end, but some things are worth that price. If you want to see all the best (and some of the worst) of being a boy, try this one.-- wiredweird"
5,Good Movie,"I was suprise by this movie, i was also suprised that Tom Hanks was in it, i didn't know anything about the movie when i picked it up but i am glad that I did. Good movie."
4,Eye opening reviews,"I just discovered this movie 9 years late, but it doesn't matter, because I thought it was great. Reading the reviews here about how there's only one boy, it makes total sense. I thought at first that that couldn't be, because the mother, ""the king"", the cop, and other characters all talk to the younger boy, but then I rememered that at the beginning and at the end, Tom Hanks says that reality is in the mind of the story teller, and that's how he rememberd the story. With this new knowledge, I realized that the movie is brilliant, and a gem. Everyone should rediscover this movie, because it is underappreciated."
3,cute movie,"first i just want to say that Bobby did exist and was not ""imaginary""! he was spoken to directly many times and when he asked questions people answered. if he wasn't real then the adults would never say his name would they? check out ""the sixth sense""......you can easily see when reviewing that movie the bruce willis character was not addressed.also the step-father had a face and it was shown constantly.....what movie were you guys watching anyhow, haha?just because he flew away in his home-made plane near the end doesn't mean he wasn't supposed to be a real kid......remember ""ET"" when all the kids on bikes went soaring through the air?i love the way people misinterpret movies and then try to act like they are smarter than the average bear :)"
3,Imaginative.,"Radio Flyer starring Elijah Wood is a sweet and heartbreaking story of two brothers who find solace with a magical radio flyer. The boys' stepfather is abusive and so they use their imagination to heal the pain of reality. Great movie, look for Tom Hanks he pops up now and then. Enjoy!"
5,Brothers,"I got this for my boys they have gotten cloeser just from this movie :"") its an all time family classic"
4,"Not the usual ""how to"" book","If you're looking for mere facts & statistics, this may not be the book for you. But if you want a more ""personal touch"", and especially if you believe new mothers should be honored and pampered, get this book! What I love most about it is the absolute reverence the author shows for childbirth and mothering. Most other baby/mother care books may have helpful info, but read like the owner's manual you'd get with a new appliance or car. This one has useful information, but also emphasizes the emotional and spiritual aspects of having a baby. Even if you don't plan to use the Eastern-based references to diet, exercise, etc., reading about other cultures' approaches to birthing and mothering can be quite a valuable contrast to the Western (highly medicalized) perspective."
2,Wasn't what I was looking for,"This book starts by noting the complete lack of information for women on postpartum health (apart for breast-feeding and depression). This is true, and was why I bought this book, having felt somewhat abandonned by the health profession immediately after giving birth.Unfortunately this book was not what I hoped. It falls into the ""Wise Woman"" style of pseudo-science, and myself, I much prefer something with statistics and hard facts on what exactly is happening to my body. I had access to plenty of that sort of information during pregnancy - but can't find it now.About the only part of this book I appreciated was the personal stories. There may be something in it for other women, but personally, I'm still looking for the real authoritative text on postpartum health."
2,You get what you pay for...,"I thought I was getting a great deal for an MP3/CD player for my car. I didn't want anything expensive, but I wanted something that would last. This was not the deck to get.I've had it for less than three months. The player 'skips' on a brand new disc while sitting still (no bumps from driving). If the disc has the smallest scratch on it, the cd will skip (this doesn't matter if it is MP3 or CD). Also, the LCD has already gone out. There is no backlighting at all, so you can't read anything on the LCD.I'm extremely disappointed in this product and wouldn't recommend to anyone."
1,Please Dont Waste your money on this!!,"This Cd player is 110% (and that aint even possible) no good. I got mine from Rex last year. It never plays your mp3s the first time, It'll just keep reading or display an error message. After about 2 weeks it started smoking on me and I took it back on my 2 year warrenty. They gave me another one and not even half a year later the same problems and now it wont even take my cds. It just keeps spitting them back out. Just plain and simply STAY AWAY!!"
1,very poor mp3 playback,"if you play only cd's then this player will work well for you. If you play cd's with mp3's it will very often, about every 5 hours of use for me, lock up, stop playing, or display one of several error messages. At which point you will need to reset the player, losing all your presets."
5,one of his great live lineups smokes on this disc!,"fz gives west germany an earful of some of his great works.. and nothing beats LIVE ZAPPA!! good sound quality too, a must have!!"
4,Great bumper!,Like the look and the ease of getting to my rear door to access storage behind my rear seat. Looks great! Had to slightly drop gas tank to install but really was easy to install.
2,Helpful outline -- Skimpy explinations,I bought both parts of this book and have only looked at them once. If you ar epreparing for a test -- LOOK AT YOUR ORAGNIC CHEMISTRY TEXTBOOK. That is usually all the ifo you need unless your book fails to explain things well. Even then these books will not help you. I have the Text on Organic Chemistry By Francis Carey and it explains things very well. You are better off getting a tutor if you are having problems or need clarification in organic chem.
2,a very tedious read indeed!,"I eventually got around to reading 'SPQR II', several years after reading 'SPQR I'. Well it certainly wasn't worth the wait. Unlike Steven Saylor's excellent Roma Sub Rosa mystery series, I find the work by John Maddox Roberts to be flat. The author doesn't delve into any of the characters very well, and he has a tendency to reference literally hundreds of characters that add little value to the story and only confuses the reader. The actual story, that is ""the conspiracy"", doesn't really form until the second half of the book and, well, it's not all that thrilling.Bottom line: I think my SPQR adventure ends with this book. Not recommended."
4,Totally enjoyable,"I usually can't stand mysteries in any way shape or form that is not the case when they have enough historical aspects to keep the historian in me interested. When this would not be enough if it were not for the sarcasm of the main character. How can you not love lines like ""My father no doubt thought the bandages on my wounds were effeminate I should have bled to death in the street like a noble Roman of the old school""If you can't at least go into it with an open mind over lines like that there is really nothing I can do to help you. If some are critical about an unconvincing attempt to place ancient Roman murders in a 21st century context well yes the books aren't going to win any awards in that regard but the books are fun enough that I don't care and neither will you if you give them half a chance."
3,To Conspire or not to Conspire,"The ending was terribly anti-climatic and the action rather vague. The personalities of the peoples involved were well drawn and lush as well as stage on which they moved. Also notably lacking was the dry, sardonic humour of the first volume. Decius seemed more given to patriot ""My city, love it or leave it"" types of musings this time."
3,"Fine book, sloppy Kindle editing","I enjoyed the first edition of this series, and was happy to purchase the second. But WHY CAN'T SOMEONE DO A BETTER JOB EDITING FOR THE KINDLE??? I've seen it in other books as well, but this time I've got to rant. Do a search for the number '1' and you'll get 8 (Kindle-sized) PAGES of occurrences where it was substituted for a capital 'I.' There's even an instance of a right bracket ( ] ) being substituted for the letter 'I.' Almost as annoying are the hard hyphenation breaks in words in the middle of lines.Don't get me wrong: I love my Kindle, and I love eBooks. Amazon has made the whole process of finding, ordering, and reading new books so easy and enjoyable. I just expect publishers to do at least as good a job proof-reading their electronic editions as they do their print ones and not to simply OCR their print editions without taking the time to check for accuracy."
4,He gets better but its not bad,"Roberts does well with interplay of people, the unfolding of the conspiracy in question and with story pacing after a slightly slow start but this time out Decius wanders through a city that goes completely undescribed. It could be a street anywhere, anywhen. The flavor of Rome or ancient times is lacking for me, an issue seemingly only with this book in the series. The Cataline Conspiracy itself is interesting and grows more memorable as he goes along, bringing that and those involved to life very well."
5,Never too Late,"My penchant are novels based on Ancient Egypt and Rome. I had purchased a few of the SPQR series years ago but never got around to reading them [why ?]. I also must start a series with the first novel. So I purchased SPQR I and II [repurchased ?]. The books have completely lived up to my hope and expectation for this genre. The author smoothly blends history, mystery and humor all in one concise package. I'm now on vol III and am probably stuck for buying all XIII volumes [so far]. I do wish that the map of Rome would have been updated and expanded to include more of the locations noted in the text.Maybe even several maps. Oops! This review was written for vol I so I've done a little editing."
4,the beauty [and utility] of simplicity,"This is a great little gutter-mount rack mounting clamp kit.Each of the 4 clamps is composed of only 3 steel pieces that bolt together, securely gripping the side rain-gutters.It comes with an aluminum adapter slug designed to mate to the ""Safari Roof Rack,"" which I don't have. The slug has rails sized to hold the nut, so I stuck the slug inside a piece of 1-1/4"" pipe and bolted that on as a cross-bar. Viola! Quick and affordable lumber rack!Sure it doesn't have the locking anodized gizmo features of some popular bike-racks, but who needs that?Note also that the GM100 is general-fit, so for instance I have installed it on my 1987 Isuzu Trooper."
5,A Very Excellent Book!,"This has to be the be all and end all for every book on Mac OS X. It has good coverage of the Mac and the iLife apps, but it stops short of Garageband - which was released early in 2004. The first 500 pages cover the GUI aspect of OS X, but I don't buy it for this. It is the next 1100 pages that cover the UNIX aspects and web technologies such as SQL and PHP, if you want to get into these things, but don't know much about UNIX, this book does a good job of hand holding you through the basic concepts. It's enough to wet your appetite, and if you want to get to know more, about PHP (for example) then you can get a book dedicated on just PHP (but a dedicated book on PHP won't tell you how to set up PHP on OS X - that's why you need this book).This is definately a book for thoses wanting to get into the UNIX side of the system. For the casual Mac user, it is overkill, and for them I would recommend ""The Missing Manual, Panther Edition"" or ""Mac OS X Panther Killer Tips""."
4,A SOLID VALUE...,"I BOUGHT THIS WATCH LAST SPRING (2007) AND HAVE BEEN VERY PLEASED WITH IT. THIS IS ONE OF 5 INVICTAS I HAVE PURCHASED IN THE PAST 2 YEARS. IT DOES BEAR SOME RESEMBLENCE TO A CERTAIN PRICEY SWISS BRAND (WHICH RETAILS FOR AROUND $25,000. FORTUNATELY, YOU WON'T HAVE TO DRAIN OFF YOUR 401-K PLAN TO BUY THIS HANDSOME AUTOMATIC PRO DIVER.IT HAS A VERY CLASSY LOOK, WITH ITS GOLD-PLATED CASE AND BAND. THE GOLD IS VERY NATURAL-LOOKING-- NOT BRASSY OR ORANGE. THE ONLY KNOCK HERE IS THE POLISHED CENTER ROW OF LINKS ON THE BAND SCRATCH VERY EASILY. THE FACE IS A LIGHT CHAMPAIGNE COLOR THAT COMPLEMENTS THE CASE AND BAND. THE JAPANESE AUTOMATIC MOVEMENT KEEPS GOOD TIME AND FREES YOU FROM EVER BUYING BATTERIES.IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A WATCH WITH JAW-BUSTING GOOD LOOKS THAT IS ALSO EASY ON THE WALLET-- THIS IS IT..."
2,Great buy for the price.,"Fast delivery. Looks nice. To address the first comment, it did stopped running the day after I got it, but only because I did not wear long enough on the first day. I've had it for a week and it has been working fine ever since.:UPDATE: Aug 18 2009This scratches easily and the gold/blue wears off making it look as cheap as it is. Now it just sits on the shelf."
5,Gift for the Groom,"I recently purchased this watch to give to my groom on our upcoming wedding day (I don't want him to be late, you know!). So I have yet to find out what the groom thinks of the watch, but I think it is worth five stars. It is a substantial, heavy watch. It looks to be beautifully crafted and even the box that it arrives in is very nice. So far, I am completely satisified with my purchase. Perhaps I will review again once I hear what the groom has to say!"
5,Invicta 9743,I really like this watch. It is a little less than optimal to read at night.There is another one on this website for $98.00
5,"100x Better Than BOTP, 50x Better Than G-Force!","Man I got this at Wal-Mart for $20.00! I was so freakin happy to just hurry up and get home and watch, and man I was hooked! This has all the footage that was edited out on BOTP and G-Force.. Gatchaman is the best out of both of the series! I'll have to adapt to the names and some of the terms in the story like ""Bird, GO!"" I hope ADV doesn't quit out on releasing the rest of the episodes like Rhino did with BOTP and G-Force. This stuff is classic!"
1,What A Big Disapointment,"I am a big fan of Jose Jose and for many years I have been following his career.This is not only a big disappointment; This is big disrespect for Jose Jose's fans.First, this is not a 2007 new release, is an old collection of songs from the 70's and the 80'sDon't let them fool you with Jose Jose's intros for every song, where he can bearly breath do to his affected voice.It's sad that sush an talented artist like him can be manipulated by Record Company that only cares about business (money).The quality of this DVD is horrible and look like it was transfer from an Old VHS source.Don't buy or rent this DVD"
1,Who picked these songs?!?!?,"The VAST majority of these songs do not represent the best of gospel music in 2002. Mostly, the songs included have never been played on gospel radio more than a couple of times. These songs are not the hits of the year. Obviously, whoever compiled the list does not listen to gospel music. I won't waste my money on such a disappointing compilation again!"
1,What Happened?,"When I first bought the WOW compilations, it was because they had either remixes of songs previously out OR they had songs that could not be found yet. For instance, Fred Hammond's Jesus Be A Fence (Live) made me buy the CD. Now...there's nothing that I can't find in my regular library. I was very dissapointed. The only song I liked that I didn't have was I Believe by Marvin Sapp...I'd rather download to save some $$$..."
2,If you want a good collection of Gospel... DON'T BUY IT.,"I have the entire collection of the WOW Gospel albums, and let me tell you, it is getting worse every time. This album was a complete desapointment, I really wish I did not buy it... I dont know who makes the songs selection, but this time they did not chose well. I decided not to buy the 2003 album either, a friend of mine told me it is just as bad as this one. C'mon, this is supossed to be THE BEST GOSPEL of the year??????"
2,Disappointment too!,"I agree. Who picked these songs? You use to be able to flow and meditate with the music, but the chosen songs do not fit the bill as previous WOW collections. I would give this CD away if I could but I can't even do that."
5,"A little cooking, a little history, a little poetry","About 25 years ago I stumbled upon Eleanor Clark's history of the oyster beds in Normandy, or her memoir of living near the oyster beds. It's been a long time, but it was simply the best combination of food writing, history, travel writing and poetry that I ever read (yes, I'm reviewing a book that I read 25 years ago, but it stayed with me). My sister and her family are going to be living in Normandy, so I have to buy it for them, and reread it myself. It's unique; it makes every other book about travel and food and ""our life in ...."" seem pallid."
4,"Not super durable, still pretty hot","After one trip to Pound Town the center ""bead"" popped off.We got another one and it stayed on much longer.For the price, it's a great novelty item so I can't really dock more than 1 star for the lack of durability."
5,getting to the root of childhood trauma,"Several years ago while I was an undergraduate majoring in Mental Health, I read Banished Knowledge. At the time I was also engaged in personal psychotherapy, getting in touch with the traumas of my past. Banished Knowledge was the first book I read that really ""put it out there"". No glossing over issues, no excuses for errs committed by others, no shiny marketing techniques to make the subject more palatable- Alice Miller just stuck the truth right out there. the book changed my life. Now, after completing a master's degree in counseling, Banished Knowledge is still the book I most reccomend. Not only does Alice Miller eloquently describe what trauma is, but she describes the differnce between blame and accountability when attempting to understand one's perpetrator. At times, the truth is hard, but the victory of understanding one's own wounds is freeing in the end."
3,I believe this book was intended for a professional audience,"First let me begin by saying that I really have enjoyed and learned from Miller's other works. They have been important text's for those of us not in ""practice"". So it was with high expectations that I purchased Banished Knowledge. After reading the first couple of chapters, I came to the conclusion that this book was more of a polemical text meant for the psychoanalsyst community then it was for the layperson. By the end of the book I was convinced that this was the case. However, I did find nuggets interspersed throughout the book that made the book at least worth reading if not completely satisfactory. If you are interested in purchasing this book with the expectations of, say, Drama of the Gifted Child just be prepared to find the writing written in a tone that seeks an audience not usually intended for her other works."
4,Worth reading......,"I have read a few of Alice Miller's books and think to truly appreciate her work, that you shouldn't judge by only reading one. I am a fan from the first book of hers I read, but learned to really respect her work the more I read. This is a good read just like her others."
1,Button on lid breaks,I purchased a two pack of these Oggi carafes. Within 6 months both lids has broken. Emailed Oggi several times looking for replacement parts with no luck.
1,OGGI Caraft,"I had used a chrome OGGI caraft for years with no complaints, it kept coffee hot for about 24 hours. Then the painted chrome parts started chipping and flaking and I felt it was unsafe and not healthy. The product is produced in China and with the recent scares wondered what was flaking off?I then purchased this OGGI Catalina model. It looks beautiful, is large, and holds a pot of coffee. That is where it stops. It DOES NOT keep coffee hot for 8 hours, actually the coffee starts cooling down immediately, even after pre-filling with hot water.I am terribly disappointed in OGGI products, and doubt that it truly is a thermal caraft. It appears to be just the medal casing with no liner.I would NOT recommend this to anyone else, unless you want lukewarm cold or hot liquids.At the cost of this product, I hope the store will take it back as I feel it was pricey."
3,Initially a Great thermos,"We make our coffee with a French press and use a thermos carafe to keep it warm and fresh. I like my coffee very hot. This is the perfect solution. We had a Oggi carafe before this one and it worked pretty well, but this particular design is better. The coffee stays steaming hot for hours. The carafe pours neatly and cleanly. I highly recommend this product.UPDATE: It lasted a a little over a year before the top malfunctioned. We now have a Thermos Nissan which is working well after almost 11 months."
1,Horribly buggy,"I use this between my iMac and a Linux desktop. At random times, it just stops working with my iMac and the leds start blinking. Then I have to unplug the cables to get it to work again.Apparently, they didn't do any testing on it."
2,Devil's Denny's,The story begins with two College guys who just came back from Mexico with Spanish Fly which they plan to sale to their college friends. They want to see if it works so they stumble along a Strip Joint and decide to test it out their. Little do they know they just stumble into a den of Ghouls who feed on human flesh. Ken Foree and Kelly Hu character are both under cover there to find the queen of these beasts and stop them. Well soon after they arrive the Ghouls unveil themselves and the feast begins. The whole story focuses around this strip joint and goes no futher. It has ok acting and pretty good effects. It more of a humorous type horror with a thin plot. I was expecting a little more from this film so I gave it only two stars. It might get three if they develop the story better but it really lacks in a lot of departments. I suggest you rent this one before laying down your cash. I was kind of disapointed .
3,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"Devil's Den is pretty much just another cheesy action-horror flick, but what makes it different is the comical aspect, and of course Devon Sawa. Sawa is great in everything he's in and this is no exception. His 90's teen idol status, makes his very underrated as an actor, but honestly it's his performance makes this worth watching."
1,I never received this item..,I never received this item in the mail. I ordered it in December and it still has not come and it is Feb. yet they still debited my money. I wouldn't recommend this seller.
4,Great condition,"When I got this DVD, it was in perfect condition, it played well without any problems and I absolutely love it. Thank you very much daveedee and keep up with the good work."
3,Canon OEM 1.7X Tele extender for Canon camcorder,Screwed onto camcorder okay -- brought image somewhat closer -- when zoomed all the way up the image wouldn't focus clearly.
3,Helpful but not comprehensive,"This book does alert you to many useful modues, extensions and accelerators and given that many of these are open source and their documentation can be skimpy, it's good to have examples and documentation from another source.However, this book is not comprehensive in it's coverage of said modules, extensions and accelerators and in areas where it covers material already explained in the documentation, I preferred the original documentation's style and explanations. The book does mention things that the original documention does not, but the original documentation talks about things that the book does not.In short, I had to read both the documentation and the book to fully understand the code."
2,Extensions? What extensions?,"You would think that a PHP book that actually mentioned ""Extensions"" as part of the title would cover extensions wouldn't you? Well in the case of this book you would be wrong. The index has exactly 1 entry for 'extensions' and even that is a 1 sentence footnote! Compare that to the 45 pages devoted to the subject in George Schlossnagle's book ""Advanced PHP Programming"" and you can get an idea of actually how deficient this book is in this aspect."
3,"Good, but not great","I bought this book with high expectations.It is a very good book, well written, and David Sklar really has done a good job writing it. However, I didn't find it that useful. It wasn't even remotely close to comprehensive about what it covered, and made only footnote mention of other tools that are out there.I ended up returning it -- something I rarely do. I didn't think it was worth the money. Most of this info is available for free online anyways."
1,Not for beginners,"This is really only for advanced PHP programmers. If you are one, it maybe will render in 5 star."
4,Nice and thin,"This is one of those DVD players with big screens. The screen is the perfect size, and is very thin. The remote is easy to use. It also has the ability to play Cd's of different formats.It also kind of looks like a sharper image portable stereo. only, it's a DVD. Sharper image sells it. It has one of the biggest screens, so it's very easy to use, therfore making it a easy view DVD player. With these great features, This is one of The best DVD players on the market."
1,get a laptop,"Laptops pcs with dvd and better screens are easily available at this price.Whoever below said that laptops will 'skip' due to the vibration, and this unit won't, has no understanding about the construction of either.Incredibly this unit has no progressive scan as well."
2,Software come with DVD doesn't support Windows Vista,"Unless you plan to buy your own software, don't buy this product if you have Windows Vista. I haven't burn any DVD yet because it requires Nero and other software upgrade. I am not willing to pay to upgrade."
4,Good drive!,"Great drive. I've yet to LS, but plan on doing so soon. Only Con here would be that it is a bit noisy."
2,Look for something else,"Its good for your DVD burning and creating, but its bulky and also slow when burning or creating audio CD's."
