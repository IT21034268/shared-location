5,Os writes life transforming books - this is another one!,"Ever since the 1960s, when he worked with Francis Schaeffer in Switzerland, Os has been writing life changing and enhancing books. Once again he does not let us down - let this book transform you as all this author's books have done since the Gravedigger File and Doubt. Go for it! Christopher Catherwood, author of CHRISTIANS, MUSLIMS AND ISLAMIC RAGE (Zondervan, 2003)"
3,3 stars.,"*** No one inside the Church would argue that the gospel is the most relevant message ever stated. The problem is, basically, that those outside of the Church do not see it that way; and therefore, there are times when modern evangelicals try to make it relevant, thus diluting the true relevance of the gospel. By going through how this has come about, the impact of trying to twist the gospel into something that appeals to all, rather like a bonsai tree, and then outlining how to cure this, Mr. Guiness makes a concise, yet profound argument. His message is a bit counter to the way things work, but tells how things should work. Is that not what the Epistles charge us to do, be in the world, but not of the world? ***Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, freelance reviewer."
1,spy sweeper.,"This product was out of date when I received it. The product kept blocking Norton so I removed it from my computer,I rate ithorrible ineffective."
3,need to know gyro to get full benefit,"this dvd is great for home practice of someone that has had sessions with a certified teacher of gyro, but the dvd does not give you the details of the exercise that really contribute to that something extra in the workout. Although the movements are basic and gentle enough that anyone can do it. Format 2 is good as well I actually got sore from level 2, Level 1 is more for massage and relaxation versus a challenging workout in level 2"
3,WOMAN'S SHOES,"THESE SHOES ARE NOT CUT TRUE TO SIZE, WHEN PURCHASING GET A HALF A SIZE LARGER. THE LEATHER NEEDS TO GIVE A LITTLE TRY SOME SHOE STRETCH, ONCE BROKEN IN NICE SHOE IF YOU LIKE LOW SLIDES."
1,"Lightweight, my @$$","This hat is so horrible, I am so disappointed! It is SO heavy weight, that you can't even hardly alter its shape. It is thicker than a wool blanket, I'd send it back if I could, but it's too much trouble/complicated!!! UGH!"
3,shorter than I realized,"The title says it all. I was a little disappointed that this book was so short and then footnotes a number of other writings of the same author. I kept thinking, ""couldn't more of the referenced works just be included here?""But it has some good content on a couple pages and I'm glad I bought it as a resource for my genealogy. Some of my ancestors came from Italy to Calumet and then moved to the Saginaw Valley and there is some mention of that sort of migration."
1,Take care which camera you have!!,I bought this Photo Printer in order to print photos from my Canon digital camera PowerShot S20. But unfortunately I cannot use it with this older Canon model. So now I am stuck with this Photo printer without ever having tried it.
4,Great Traction,"Wow! I'm in my late 30's and I used to play with these type of race tracks when I was younger....Now days, like most everything, the quality has greatly improved. The cars really hug the track. I can't believe how fast these cars go and stay on the track. Also, the colors and numbers are fun because you can relate to them with the real guys driving on TV.I definately recommend this toy to most anyone. My daughter, who is 3 1/2 even enjoys playing. There is not many toys that a father and daughter can play together. It's tough for her to get the hang of the trigger throttle, but she eventually does. The game does get boring after a while for the older kids, but it's NASCAR racing....what do you expect"
1,meh,"I don't know if I can write 20 words to describe this thing. Pretty girls wind up in some twisted, whacko town ruled by a twisted, religious black dude. Apparently there's something in the air that makes people fall under the spell. I dunno. Do these people have jobs? I mean, seriously. What do they do all day? And when the girls escape, nobody notices. Which gives us the young, fit girls fleeing from zombie-like crazed killers. As the title says - meh."
3,So Bad - But I Kinda Liked It,"This movie was bad, very bad, but oh, how it entertained me. First off, the acting was horrendous, laughably so. Especially from the lady who plays the mean blonde. There's no xray on this movie so I don't know her name. She alone is worth watching this stink fest. I've seen several of the actors in other projects in which they gave decent performances so maybe it was the direction that made everything terrible. In any event, if you've got a free friday night, some wine in a box and an unlimited supply of cheesy poofs - this movie is for you."
2,Too little too late,"I was told this was the best baseball book of the year. I didn't get it until after the season started, and when I did, I got a juvenile treatise with about four bright spots, and a really bad case of envy for everyone else that does analysis. I would be embarrassed to be associated with this incarnation of a tantrum. My five year old can behave with a little decorum, which is more than I can say for whoever edited this. Only a couple of writers are worth even glancing at, Firtado and Walker, and they're clearly too smart to stick with this sinking ship for long. Their work gives this book a second star, but just barely.It's also hard to read, amateurishly put together, and basically a complete waste of money and time. There's no reason to buy this book. The childishness evidence in this book is so bad as to be disrespectful to the game. Don't these authors even LIKE baseball?Hideous."
2,big and bad are correct,"As a baseball fan who reads any book of analysis I can find, I eagerly awaited this year's BBBA. I was extremely disappointed that the editors found it necessary to go into childish tirades against their competitionI usually don't wallow thru all the stats that the BBBA folks put out as I enjoy the commentary more. However, since the commentary was more in the line of sophmoric back slapping and finger pointing, I thought I'd study the stats more carefully.The BBBA folks will tell that they are right. I did find much of their analysis to countradict their competitors. While I don't know who is right or wrong, a least let me decide as to which information I find more useful, don't tell me.I especially found the attacks on Bill James to be curious. Bill James started the revolution on baseball anyalsis, in essence giving these insolent writers their start. If you don't agree with him, just write it, don't rip him.I won't spend another penny on the folks from BBBA."
1,Deja Vu Review,"I tried it again this year despite my better instincts. I won't again. These guys are oblivious to their readers, even ones who wish desperately to steer them to their strengths and away from their weaknesses. Do they even read the feedback from their readers? A promising endeavor has just become a sad downhill slide with good baseball analysis in the early years giving way to puffery and pretentiousness and, worst of all, silly putdowns of the competition."
1,Take the title literally,"I found the 2000 edition to be packed with spite and petulance - especially towards baseball, and other statisticians. Additionally, the quality of the writing is woeful."
5,I'm no diddy fan whatsoever - but I think this is GREAT,"To those trying to compare this to ZEP; forget it - this isn't a ZEP knockoff and doesn't pretend to be. It certainly isn't some type of 'Weird Al' parody. The music video of this is completely KILLER, too bad it isn't available anywhere in Hi-Def. Why this isn't on the DVD is a mystery to me ( I do like the Wallflower's version of Heros, but this should be there too). I saw this live on SNL before I saw the movie, and I didn't get it. Anybody who doesn't get this should see the music video (low quality on youtube). I have chanced to catch more than I've wanted to of P-Diddy's performances in various places- and for me, this it the only good thing I've ever seen from him. I think it rocks!"
1,Oh man . . . .,"I'm huge Page fan, but this is just gross. I just don't know what to say, it's that bad. Puff Daddy (P. Diddy or whatever) just can't rap. Straight face here, he actually says ""I want to fight you, I'll (...) bite you, I can't stand you"" Enough said on Diddy's rapping ability. His attempts at a Plant-like mock orgasim are pathetic to the point it's difficult to tell whether he's faking said orgasim or constipated. Page's remade backing track isn't terrible, a bit too ""metal"" maybe, but could never save the song from Puff Daddy/P. Diddy anyway.This is a terrible remake of an awesome song. Thank god Page has moved on and doing excellent work in Page/Plant."
1,did not receive!!!,I ordered this over a month ago and have emailed company. did not receive item or response.
5,Loved Movie.,"Movie was exactly as described, and would definetly recommend this movie to any one. They shipped this item very quickly."
1,Gold Barbs became dinner,Does NOT work for gold barb fry. They swam right out through the vents and became lunch. Lost them all. Slots WAY too large for barbs.
1,dont buy this or your frys will be dinner for other fishes,"the vends re too big, even if the head is not going thru, the tail still sticks out and other big fishes will eat your fry... 1 night, i lost about 20 of them, if i can give this stupid prodct negative stars i would"
2,FAR TOO SWEET!,This cereal has a good crunch but a far too fake sweet flavor. It has a strange diet shake after taste also.A small amount of regular cereal would be far better and cheaper..
5,stunned,i recently discovered boyzone on a pbs special.i was amazed by their tight harmonies.country music is my favorite but boyzone has a new fan in me.
2,Remake Falls Short of Original,"This is a remake of Benny's original 1980 album and is nowhere near as good. The great song, Into the Night, was particularly stronger on the original album. His voice was much stronger and fuller but of course, he was 20 years younger too. I have this CD primarily for the one song. Only because the original album is not available on CD."
5,EXCELLENT SERVICE,I LOVE TO ORDER MY BOOKS AND CD FROM AMAZON.COM BECAUSE I GET THEM IN GOOD CONDITION AND I GET THEM IN LESS THAN A WEEK. I DO NOT HAVE TIME TO GO ABOUT 25 MILES TO BOOKS A MILLION OR TO THE MALL FOR MY CD'S SO THANK GOODNESS THERE IS AMAZON.COM TO ORDER THEM AND THEY GET DELIVERED TO MY DOOR. THANKS AMAZON FOR YOUR GREAT SERVICES.
1,DISAPPOINTED,I HAVE EMAILED YOU SEVERAL TIMES TO TELL YOU I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED THE BENNY MARDONES CD AND AM VERY DISAPPOINTED. CAN YOU PLEASE RESEND THIS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE! THANK YOU!
3,It's okay,"This is NOT the version of ""into the night"" we all fell in love with. it's still nice but just not the same, for me atleast. If you are thinking of buying this cd solely for the song ""into the night"" and want the original version, get the cd ""no. 1 hits of the 80's"""
3,"If You're Looking For The Original Recording Of ""Into The Night"",,,,,","You will find the old radio version on No.1 Hits Of The 80's. This version is o.k., maybe even better than the old one in a way. But I really wanted that old familiar sound."
2,"INTO THE NIGHT WAS HIS ONLY HIT........VERY GOOD GOT,,,,,,,","I WOULD BUY THE CD JUST FOR ""INTO THE NIGHT"""
2,Remake Falls Short of Original,"This is a remake of Benny Mardones' original 1980 album and is nowhere near as good. His voice was much stronger and fuller, particularly on the great song, Into the Night. Of course, he was also 20 years younger when it was recorded. I have this CD for that one song, only because the original recording is not available on CD."
2,Not That Good.....,"The original ""Into the Night"" was awesome. This version and the entire CD leaves a lot to be desired. I was very disappointed. Sounded like he recorded it in his garage. I wasted $13.00."
2,Music Freak,"Although this is Benny Mardones, it comes no where near the power vocals of Never Run Never Hide. I found the vocals airy, and over-dubbed. Glad I have Never Run on CD(and vinyl). This album was a great disappointment."
4,Benny Mardones,His older work is the best. His voice is great and the songs are some of his best work ever.
3,Finally Found!!!,"I had been searching for the original song release of ""Into the Night"" when I purchased this, Loved it even though it is not the original. I went in search for it again and found it in a cd called ""ROCK MEMORIES VOL. 2"" which I also purchased from Amazon. I have both now along with other great songs that take me back to my youth. It is amazing that hearing an old song from the past can take you back....So if you are looking for the Original version of this song, get the,CD ""ROCK MEMORIES VOL. 2"" as well..."
2,"No, NO, NO!","Menstrual bleeding, personal stories of abandonment and enlightenment, blah blah blah, a bunch of rubbish from aging people who were abused and now are better. Join a women's liberation group or a ""moon cycle"" clan for free, but don't buy this uninformative and uncreative rubbish that has nothing to do with psychology or liberation."
1,The little caboose that could!,"Hyatt has canned another ham for his pantry. The Iraqi Information Minister is more credible. Unfortunately associating yourself with 'Cool' people isn't enough to convince people you are likewise 'Cool.' Ignorance is luminous. So remember, if you hear a quiet 'Aye' in the dark side of your mind, it might not be the Fonz. It could be this guy trying to sell you another sad book."
5,Another splendid a cappella selection,"Like the first volume of transcriptions for a cappella choir performed by Accentus, the 14 pieces on this CD are a mixture of a few instrumentals but mainly vocal pieces for soloists that have been transcribed for choir. There were a few pieces on Vol.1 that were unfamiliar to me but I knew all of these works in their original format. Provided you feel that the addition of a choir of voices to instrumental or solo vocal music adds to rather than detracts from their beauty, then you will probably enjoy this CD. The choir sings beautifully and soprano Solange Añorga is featured on five of the tracks. The works the choir sing include Bach, Vivaldi, Schubert (4), Debussy, Ravel (2), Mahler (2), Scriabin, Prokofiev and Wagner.Accentus: Transcriptions"
1,Mr. Blue,Re-Stock It will not ship this product as advertised. They claim it is offered through someone else's error and promised several weeks ago to remove it. It is still here. They shipped one of four cartridges and when questioned they had it picked up and promised a refund.Call me Mr. BlueDon't bother trying to buy this bargain.
3,Hoping it gets better!,"Granted I have only finished Chapter 1 (out of 9), but I must say that I am more confused than ever! This seems to be a book for those who are fans of unschooling (I'm not) and Charlotte Mason/classical education (I am). I feel like the authors are attempting to heap shame onto anyone who is homeschooling and using a curriculum. Although we do use ""real"" reading books for history and science, we use a traditional curriculum for phonics and math, and we love it! I would definitely use caution when recommending this book to a new homeschooler or someone who is considering it. The authors obviously feel that their way is the right way, so if you're not doing what they're doing, you may find yourself suddenly disillusioned. This is such a popular book, and it has so many positive reviews here, that I'm thinking surely it must get better, but I have so far found the book to be condemning and slightly bizzare."
5,Excellent Reference for Christian Homeschooling Moms,"My son is just 19 months old, but I already know we will be homeschooling him. I've been reading various references on getting started and have found this book to be one of the best. Written from a Christian perspective, this book shares personal stories, basic how-tos and lots of references.Although this volume was written early on in the Internet age, most of what is has to share is timeless. I'm figuring on consulting this book throughout my homeschooling career."
5,this book is incredible!,"I was thinking about homeschooling before I started reading this book. After I read just the first chapter, I was convinced it was the best thing for my family! There is tons of scripture used to back up their views and it really makes you think about your choice of schooling. Also, they give others arguments against homeschooling and their response to it. I have read about 6 other homeschooling books now and this one is still the best. For anyone who even remotely thinks that they might be interested in homeschooling, this is a must read! It is very challenging to our society's way of thinking and a real eye-opener to how we so easily accept the status quo. Great Book!"
5,An Essential Guide,"If I only owned 2 books on homeschooling, they would be ""Educating the Wholehearted Child"" by the Clarksons and ""The Charlotte Mason Companion"" by Karen Andreola. The Wholehearted Child is a manual with many how-to ideas, lots of background information on homeschooling and numerous helpful forms. It provides information on curriculum, methods, scheduling, resource availability and much more. This book is an excellent resource for every homeschooling parent and is must-reading for those who are just beginning to homeschool."
5,Great Pictures!,"I am a huge O-Town fan, and Hangin' With O-Town is a great picture book that has tons of facts about each of the guys. After reading it you feel like you know the guys more, and you get a look at a bunch of their favorite things. It's a book every O-town fan should get!"
5,One word.........,"FANTASTIC!I fell in love with Rolls-Royce Motorcars when I was a boy (after seeing ""The Yellow Rolls-Royce""), and even more when I used to watch ""Burke's Law."" This volume just serves to re-invigorate a love that has never died. Buy it, breathe it, let your fingers and eyes take in every word and picture."
4,"Quriky, strange and yet, lovable!","At first I wasn't sure what to make of this book. I kept reading and found myself turning the pages with anticipation. It's definately a parody in places but it also manages to combine philosophy, humor and even Jesus into a rich soup of suburban life. It's one of those books you pick up and can't quite put down. The title character of ""April"" is the ray of light in this crazy mixed up household. It's a great vacation/beach read."
3,Kind of amusing in a very weird way,"I really wanted to like this book - but I never really got the point. The random European spellings of words in a book supposedly set in Philadelphia really threw me off and I had difficulty following whether the idea was that this supposedly ""normal"" family was really quite bizarre or what. Top it off with a Scooby-Doo-ish resolution to the ""mystery"" (many facts suddenly wrap up the resolution that were nowhere in the story earlier) and I was pretty disappointed with the whole thing."
4,Good account of the hurdles to becoming a NASCAR driver,"I am a Mark Martin fan, and this book makes me even more proud of my choice of drivers to follow. Some good pictures, but I would have liked to have seen more text. Probably not the first book on NASCAR one should buy, but NASCAR fans will appreciate it."
3,Interesting summation of Marks Life in racing,"Although not a mark martin fan, i enjoyed the informative journey of Marks life in racing. From his early days in whatever through trying times of having to sell his team. Mark just seems to be one of those guys who tries to be a decent competitor but fights the frustration of constantly being the bridesmaid and not the bride"
2,One disc totally ruined,"Two from the 3-disc set were fine, but one, the vegetarian disc, was scratched across the entire disc, rendering it useless."
1,Bad Experience,"The shipping time on this item was perfect! It arrived a day earlier than the expected delivery date. I think i may have had a bad bulb or something because it was bright as hell and was great for the first 30 minutes. I turned it off and then turned it back on a while later and it did NOT WORK. I thought maybe the lamp was broken, so I tried another lamp and nothing happened. Really disappointed and mislead by such a high customer rating."
2,Short Lifetime,"I bought it on Feb 2009, and after less than 1 year, it burnt out. I only used it for a few hours every day. It's life is much shorter than the claimed 8,000 hours."
5,UFO in a Box: Episode 2,"Holy Cow again! I could not believe how freaking bright this bulb is. Seriously, you could use it for special effects in a UFO movie. On the serious side, it has a very even, pleasing light. The color temperature is as good as any florescent light I've seen (I normally hate any fluorescent light).I bought this and one other bulb (85w) to replace the ones that came with my CowboyStudio-In-A-Box. Love the studio, HATE the bulbs that came with it. Those bulbs were not nearly bright enough and had a sick, bluish tone to them, definitely not the 5500k they were supposed to be.I put THIS bulb in place of the others and oh how very freaking bright! Just a bit brighter than the 85w I also bought and I would say equally good temperature. So glad I bought it.One caution. This bulb is HUGE, others do not exaggerate it's size. But the good news is, it still works fine with my photo umbrellas with about a quarter inch clearance to spare.Let there be light."
1,One thing bothers me...,"The book is nicely put together and attempts to offer many good reasons to wait from a spiritual viewpoint, but one question kept nagging at me and ultimately makes this book worthless: how does the author know what God wants?"
2,Slow reading,"I have a vested interest in Morgan's raiders since the Morgan in question is a long distant relative of mine. I have tried to find worthwhile reading material on him, but have not been able to do so. Basil Duke was Morgan's right hand man and wrote this detailed history. This means that it was written more than a century ago and it certainly shows. It is a long and slow read, with many details that could have been left out. It was stifling enough that I couldn't even finish it."
4,Nice book for kids.,I really love baseball books and this book is really nice for young kids. Although I liked his other book better about Lou Gerhig. I have both of books because I want my son to grow up liking baseball like I do. All in all it is a good book to add to a collection for a child and to pass on to grandkids.
5,Wild and fun and true!,"I can't believe he did all these things! You learn a lot about stuff that matters to each and every American, but don't worry, it's painless cause it's so funny. It's like George Plimpton suddenly got coolness and a sense of humor. He should do a sequel."
2,Poor Sound Quality,"This is a review of the sound quality only, not the music.This is a pretty loud cd considering the type of music (as in 'loudness war' loud, google it if you don't know what the loudness war is). There is a fair amount of compression and clipping and distortion. Which is totally unnecessary given the style of music. People who are going to buy this record aren't looking for in your face Metallica mastering, not by a long shot.But I guess it's typically of today's mastering guys that they don't want to be known as quiet engineers so even on releases like acoustic folk they will jam the levels up and distort the music. GRRR!"
5,Fantastic Album,"To think that this album was first recorded in 1965 is amazing. It is sooo good -- very rhythmic -- nice jazzy and bluesy elements. Great guitar playing. Pleasure to listen to. Davy does a great cover of Dylan's ""Don't Think Twice It's Alright."" From the very first song, ""Leaving Blues"" you know this album is special. ""Moaning"" and ""Skillet"" are also wonderful. 21 great tracks. Well, I didn't want to name them all. 1965, right!"
1,I NEVER RECEIVED THIS BOOK BUT WAS STILL CHARGED.,I NEVER RECEIVED THIS BOOK BUT WAS STILL CHARGED. DON'T BELIEVE ON THIS SELLER.ABSOLUTE WASTE OF TIME.
5,good read,"great story with a lot of suspenselove it when characters also havesense of humors, and they spar back and forth withthe one they are interested in"
4,Agree - works but breaks,"I agree with others. The product works pretty well but they don't last. We had one stop working early on that was replaced. Since then we have been using four mole movers around our property which do seem to keep the moles/voles away. We remove them during the winter. I just put them back in the ground last week. All four started working then two of them quit. I've actually taken the two bad ones apart. You have to drill out the bottom plastic piece then push out the circuit. From the little testing I've done so far, my best guess so far is that the little buzzer on the circuit board is the part that fails over time. If I can locate replacement buzzers, I will try to fix the units. The buzzer is a Kingstate KSG8406 which is made in Taiwan. I've found the manufacturers website, but no retail source. If you can keep the units from crapping out, they will probably work for you."
5,Exhart MoleMover,"I have purchased just about everything on the market to rid moles from my yard,then i tried another brand of solar powered mole chasers which worked quiet well for about three years. Then tried to find the same brand again and found Exhart MoleMover for about half the price of the other brand. I am very happy with the results (to say nothing of the savings)of your product. THANKS"
4,Gopher It Worked for Me,"I purchased the Exhart Gopher-It about one year ago. I must say I was dubious about the potential effectiveness of this technique of sonically repelling small animals. I followed the directions about placement and after about a month we noticed that we no longer have gopher tunnels in our organic vegetable garden of about 1200 sf. Because we are in a tiered garden arrangement we bought two Gopher-It's per 50' long tier, one for each end. This arrangement proved effective as long as I relocated the location about five feet every couple of months. Alkaline battery life is good, lasting about 7-9 months in moderate (never freezing) temperatures. I would recommend this product to a friend and I'm planning on buying some more to get rid of the gophers that have overrun our lawn area;)"
1,Party Time,The Exhart mole mover device appears to attract more moles than they repel. I believe my mole families were enjoying the noise makers and inviting all their nearby relatives to join in the party as I had far more mole mounds than ever. I had 3 mole movers in use at the time.
1,Useless,"I had underground rodents that were making dens, collapsing the ground. I put this thing in, and a few days later, I got gopher mounds up by the house, first I've ever had. Then, I got mole mounds all through my back garden. In other words, all I had to deal with to begin with were dens. Within days of this thing, I seemed to attract gophers and moles. I've been dropping poison, and seem to have gotten rid of them. Go for decon rat and mice poison -- cheaper and much more efficient than this useless piece of garbage."
1,Poorly Made,This product does actually seem to work. Problem is that they break down just after the warranty runs out. So plan on replacing the batteries every six months and buying a new one every year.
1,Doesn't work in for me in north-central Texas,"I bought 2 of these based on the good reviews I read and also on the fact that my dad (who lives in south-central Oklahoma) said they work for him. I gave them a chance based on some of the things said about the moles being attracted to them at first (the box warns you about this), and I have to rate these as a dud for where I live. I've had them for several weeks (I'd say over 8 weeks) and the moles LOVE them!!! In fact, I've had increased activity where I've installed them. I'm really disappointed as I thought this was the answer to my mole problem. One positive thing: the batteries are still going strong. I'm going to give mine to my dad. :-("
1,Waste of money/ Causes frustration,"I was duped by their tech support into buying 4 more of the solar version after the first one did not work in an area that is less than 800 sq. ft. (1 in each planter box and 1 for the lawn). I have attached an image with gopher holes within 2 feet of the unit.Tech support does not answer questions after they give you their canned answer about how to make the product work, which is to buy more of them."
1,Poor product and customer service,"Purchased two new units, only one worked. When I asked Wiserliving for a replacement they want me pay expenses to return their product so they can determine if they might provide a replacement. They do not know the meaning of customer service. Don't trust them they are rude and dishonest."
1,Only 1 out of three functioned,"I ordered three. One never worked, the second worked for a week, and the third continues to function, but the gophers remain. Save your $$$."
3,6 months and still working....I think.,"I was not sure if these would stand up to winter weather in Colorado, but after 6 months it is still making its noise and doing its thing. As far as its effectiveness, that is a different story. I have 3 of these in my yard and according to the product description that should provide coverage to the entire yard. The gophers have not gone away, they may have moved a little further away from the annoying noise these make, but not very far.I have not been able to get anything to work, and so these may be slightly better than my other attempts, but I think you would need to put them every 10 feet or so in your yard to really get the job done. If you have a small area that you would like to keep the moles and gophers out of these may be just what you need."
1,In my experience this did not get rid of the pests.,"In my personal experience and opinion this product has not worked to get rid of the pests for me at all. I have used it for a few months and the mounds seem even worse. I had hopes this would work. Maybe for some people it works well, but for me it just did not get rid of the pests."
1,Failed within a few days,"The unit stopped chirping within a few days. Fresh batteries did not revive it. Willing to try another, but there seems to be a quality control problem."
1,Did not work,"We bought several. Had them all placed in a small space. The product did not work. Don't waste your time and money. The only way to get rid of moles is to kill them, not my favorite thing to do but it's the only way."
2,doesn't plump your lips or whatsoever,"It claims to plump your lips but i didn't see any difference. Really sticky stuff, not pleasant at all, I gave it two stars just for the smell. It's pricey too so I'm really dissapointed.Did I mention it kinda burns when you rub your lips a bit? yeah, your tongue burns too when you lick it. Anyway, it's only my experience. Maybe someone's pleased with this product, but not me. If you're still planning to buy it i'd recommend trying it on first."
1,"Product is ok, but Amazon.com is NOT.","I ordered this dresser from Amazon and it arrived damaged. Huge chunks were taken out of the top of the dresser. It appears that wherever Amazon had this item shipped from did not properly store or transport it. Accidents happen, so I returned the item and exchanged it for a new one, again with Amazon. This time the dresser was WORSE. The top piece was completely SPLIT IN HALF! Again, I returned the item. I ordered the dresser from Babies R Us and it came beautifully packaged and did not have any damage. I was very disappointed in Amazon. To have this happen twice is unacceptable. I will not order from Amazon again because it is clear they deal with vendors that are not up to par."
3,"Nice looking, but not as well made as I expected","I bought this dresser to match the Kalani crib that I had already purchased. While the dresser is very nice looking when assembled, I was surprised to find that not all the materials are solid wood. The back of the dresser is a pressboard type material, as are the bottoms of the drawers. Additionally, the wood is a little soft. I like the dresser, just wish it was a little more solid."
3,Not bad,"We ordered this dresser to match the Kalani crib and the color is not exactly the same but close enough. I like the quality of the individual pieces but was disappointed with the way the drawers are assembled considering the price we paid for it. The drawers actually glide via sliders attached to the 2 sides of the dresser rather than down the middle of each drawer (does that make sense)? This makes the drawers less sturdy and feel cheap. If I were to do it over again, I would purchase this from an actual furniture store with better craftmanship. The instructions are also HORRIBLE. The pictures of the pieces are not drawn to scale which makes it confusing on the assembly and the isometric pictures look more like an optical illusion. It would help if the pieces were labeled (front/back, etc)."
3,"good quality, but buy in store","While you might save money buying this online, the photos do not really let you see the 'grain' of the wood. I purchased this in 'espresso' which to mean means a DARK wood, and this wood is extremely grainy...if you, like me, do not like grained wood than skip this crib and choose another where you can get it in a darker/more solid color. Or definitely view it in person first!"
4,easy to assemble.,"I looked everywhere for a good, used crib in this style, but you really can't beat this price for a brand new crib. It's very classy looking in the nursery and was relatively easy to assemble. So far we're very happy that we went with this product! I know other people had commented that theirs came scratched, but ours was perfect in the box it was shipped in."
1,It's Not Going to Last,"My parents bought this furniture set for my son thinking it would last. It's not going to make it to his 2nd birthday. We have to look into buy all new furniture for my baby's room now that he's 18 months. That's about how long this will last. Draw fronts are falling off when you open the drawers. The drawer bottoms slide out and his clothes get stuck or fall through and the drawer can't open. These problems have come from just light clothes in the drawer and gentle use. It also scratches easily and look like it's 20 years old, not a year and a half. Save yourself some money and spend the extra money initially to buy something made of real wood and that is built for you.Hope that helps some future parents from being annoyed with wasting money on this furniture."
4,Good dresser for the price,"I was concerned by all the negative reviews, most of which addressed the difficulty of assembling the dresser. One reviewer wrote that even he, an engineer by profession, labored over the project for hours and days and still couldn't put it together properly. Ignore this. Assembly is required, the instructions are unclear at times, but you do not need to be ""handy"" to make quick work of it. If you know how to work a screwdriver you'll be fine.The outside parts look good and are of good material, so the dresser is sturdy. The inside parts, like the bottom of the drawers, are mostly hidden and are of poorer quality. Since it will be holding baby clothes, not bowling balls and sandbags, I expect that it will hold up well."
1,Trash,This is the biggest piece of crap furniture I have ever purchased. Don't waste your money. Spend a little extra and get something that will last. The drawers don't fit right and change positions every time you open them. I hate this dresser!!
2,"Cheap, even considering the price","First off, yes this product is priced low so one shouldn't expect great things. But this product is borderline worthless. Very, very soft woods (even on the top surface!), flimsy construction (wood was splitting left and right when I was assembling the unit), and it takes a few hours to assemble. My advice would be to spend the money on a dresser from IKEA. You'll get better quality at about the same, or even lower, price."
2,A dresser in kit form,"I purchased this from a wish list. The recipient was not happy to find that every single piece had to be put together. Nothing was preassembled and the instuctions were very poor. Some parts had to be taken apart to complete later steps. This should be listed as a kit for a dresser. IKEA products come ready to use compared to this. When finished, they liked the look of the dresser but would not buy again. Expected better for the amount paid."
4,Very Cute & Sturdy,"The dresser is extremely sturdy & easy to assemble. I put it together myself at 9 months pregnant & had only 1 small issue, which I resolved by using a phillips screwdriver with a longer handle in order to get more torque. In order to give the dresser a more polished look, I purchased different drawer knobs & everyone simply loves the dresser! It's not a tall 4-drawer but it is deep, which makes it more sturdy & to me a better choice for a baby's room because it is less likely to tilt. Overall, I am highly satisfied with my purchase."
3,"Nice, but overpriced","We purchased this dresser to match the DaVinci Kalani Espresso Crib. As others have reviewed, it is very difficult to put together. It does look nice, and will serve it's purpose, but it is cheaply made and again the directions are not clear at all. Overall, I'd have to rethink seriously prior to purchasing again."
2,nice looking but poorly built,"This item is nice looking but poorly built. I was shocked at the poor quality as I expected more for the price. It says ""some assembly required"" but comes flat packed (like Ikea furniture but most Ikea furniture is better made) and has to be COMPLETELY assembled. I have assembled a lot of furniture in my life and this is by far the most poorly made. If I had not been charged so much for shipping I would have returned the dressers right away. I have only had them for a week and already two of the drawers have come apart and I have had to re-assemble. Think twice on this piece - I think you can find MUCH better for equal or less money."
3,Nice for the price,"Ignore the crazy people with a poor review on this because of the quality of this dresser. Of course it's not the nicest, most fancy well built dresser ever made, but for the money it is a very nice dresser. It is exactly what I expected. The finish is very nice, but be careful with it because it can scratch easy. Yes the wood is particle board and pine but what would you expect for the price. The drawers open & close with ease and it all went together fairly easily. Great bang for your buck."
3,Consider carefully,"As beautiful and perfectly coordinated this dresser is to the Kalani crib, I can't say I'm entirely satisfied. Assembly wasn't super difficult only because my carpenter friend helped me. Even then, we made a couple mistakes because the instructions are ridiculously unclear and difficult to read. Be sure to assemble over a carpeted surface as it scratches incredibly easy and don't even think of trying without an electric drill. The 2 piece back panel was missing from my package, and because of that my dresser seems a bit unstable. If I had purchased this myself, I would be more upset, as I don't see it worth the price. Having it now, I would have directed the cost toward a better quality dresser."
5,Sturdy and beautiful,"Let me start out by telling you that i bought the whole Kahlini collection and I was skeptical because of the bad reviews that said it was cheaply made. I am so impressed at how well it is actually made. The only thing I will say that may be negative is that the bottom of the drawers aren't thicker then about a half-inch, but they seem to be pretty sturdy. And the sides of the drawers are pine wood, but most dressers have that on the inside. The back is made of the same material, not very thick, but its the back so im not worried about it. I am not made of money especially with a little one coming, and we didnt have the money to buy a collection at a store, but I am so happy with this purchase, its going to last us a very long time! I hope this helps you out."
4,FINE CRAFTSMANSHIP BUT QUITE A BIT OVERPRICED,"Fine craftsmanship but quite a bit overpriced.PROS:Excellent fit and finish. The screw holes were pre-marked/ predrilled with precision and had no issues with part placement.Paint is evenly applied and generously coated and will not scratch off easily. I had smeared my marker on the top surface but was easily wiped off with alcohol.The drawers lined up perfectly and no catch with repeated usage.CONS:Quite a bit overpriced. I saw similar items that cost less.Parts were not marked with letters or numbers for ease of installation. Make sure to pay close attention to detail when assembling parts of the same group (Right can easily be mistaken for Left).Screws, nails and other components are provided with the exact amount needed. No extras.SEE MY POSTED PICTURES!"
4,Sludge Monster,"""Garfield Weighs In"" is the fourth Garfield strip set, (dailies and Sundays) from March-November 1980. Pretty entertaining. A few things happen in it. Bit of Nermal, Jon gets a date, the ""Sludge Monster"", Garfield's ""History of Dogs"". Worth a read."
2,sounds quality is no good,"Before I bought this Blu-ray DVD, I thought only Video and music, not talking, sound should be very good. When I got it and play, I was quite dis pointed, it seems like there is helicopter sound behind the music, also it's stereo, not 5.1 channel. Picture quality are OK."
1,Bad line wrap,"Librarian is right in his review. The line wrapping in this Kindle edition is terrible. It really needs to be fixed before anybody should buy it, which is a shame since the story is excellent."
2,"Hmmmm, Not sure",I got this product from another store. And it will get rid of odor. But everytime I have used this product I always get headaches and feel dizzy. A couple times I had heart palpitations.I noticed it also leaves a residue on the items. Be very careful with leather products and simulated leather products becausethis product and mix with leather and simulated leather in such a way that will give off toxic fumes...and when this happens you will have to throw the item away.I had this happen to my simulated leather purse.
1,Horrible Residue,"It covered NO odor in my home, cigarette or sweaty sock smell from my Stepsons room. I have hardwood floors & this product said ""safe to use on hard surfaces"" but the residue left behind from spraying the way I would Frabreeze was awful. I could slide like Tom Cruise in Risky Business across my floors after using this. I can't imagine how a product that leaves such a residue behind can be ""Non-Toxic"" The Bottle DOES say ""May become sticky or spotty"" but the advertisers website DID not. Sticky residue or not, the odors it portended to knock out remain. Hate it."
3,"Colors a bit off, but good overall","As in all titles in the Great Modern Masters series published by Abrams: Colors are not vibrant, often with a brownish tint or/and too dark, and their accuracy is just O.K. There are 64 pages of a good size 9.5x12 inches (24x30.5 cm). It begins with an introduction with 5-6 small b&w pictures on 2 pages, which is followed by a biography with 5-6 small b&w pictures on 2 next pages. The rest is dedicated to good size over 60 full color plates divided into chapters dedicated to artist's carrier periods, style directions, or themes, each described by 12-16 lines of text. The series is inferior to the same size paperback series published by Taschen in 1990s, but superior to Taschen's series of smaller sizes published latter. Unfortunately, the Taschen series does not cover Bacon, Botero, Brancusi, Braque, Calder, de Chirico, Johns, Kokoschka, Leger, Man Ray, Malevich, Modigliani, and Rouault this series does."
5,"Great CD, I think its his best of the 70's","A1A is my personal favorite album of buffett in the 70's. I split his albums into the three decades he has recorded in and this one just might even be his best album ever. Door No. 3, Migration, Trying to Reason With Hurricane Season, A Pirate Looks At 40, and Tin Cup Chalice are songs that will take you away to key west while you are sitting in your living room chair. Its very easy to listen to and its not one of those where you only like a few songs, this one you just pop it in and listen to it for hours, if you are a ParrotHead and don't have this album, GET IT!!!!"
3,Fairly mediocre...,"... not as exciting as his earlier ""before the beach"" work, not as fun as his later ""beach"" work, and nothing to get particularly excited about. Just average semifolk."
1,Disappointed,"The A1A Album includes ""God's Own Drunk"" and this is not included on the CD with the same title. How did this happen? We main purpose we purchased the CD for this song and it's not here."
5,Tracks,1. Makin' Music For Money2. Door Number 33. Dallas4. Presents To Send You5. Stories We Could Tell6. Life Is Just A Tire Swing7. A Pirate Looks At Forty8. Migration9. Trying To Reason With Hurricane Seasons10. Nautical Wheelers11. Tin Cup Chalice
5,It's a Key West groove,"This album takes you right down there to Key West, and gives you a pretty good insight into what life was like there back in the early 70's. I rank it right up there in Buffett's top 3 or 4, but not the absolute best. But this is definitely Jimmy before the hype, books, plays, and peripheral items besides the music. If you ever get a chance to make the drive from Miami to Key West in a convertible, make sure you have this CD with you. And after all, aren't we all ""makin' Music for Money'? Jerry Diaz, ..."
5,"""Grassroots"" Buffett","This album is a ""soul connection"" for me. I became a Buffett fan at the age of 15, when this album was first released and it is still my favorite to this day. These songs are from the pre-parrothead days, when Jimmy was trying to find his place in the music business. With some soulful influence from some of the Nashville and Austin ""underground"" songwriters, he established his own category with this one. I've been following his music ever since - sometimes disappointed, but always loyal. Change and progress are inevitable in music, technology, and business, but there are times when we need to escape the stress and pressure that such change and progress produces. This album helps me do that from time to time. I never go on vacation without it! Every song on this album is a treasure!"
2,not the one pictured!!,it was not the book pictured on the website. my husband wanted to complete his set - this copy stands out like a sore thumb because it doesn't match the rest of the set. I wanted to return it but my husband said not to bother.
2,Ephesians Book,The book sent was an older copyright version that served no purpose for my use. It was a waste of money and not the book I ordered. Butch
1,item is not as it appears,"I ordered a black leather camera case for a fuji fine pix-v10. I was sent a blue vinyl case with ridges. This case was also on the website. I sent it back because it was not what I ordered. Then a few days later I recieved another package from Amazon and I thought it was the black leather camera case, but NO, it was the same blue case!! I just want to warn anyone that the item may not be as pictured."
3,Better than Brillo or a sponge,"I made an initial review of these pads, lauding them for cleaning thoroughly and not scuffing anything. Well, to my chagrin, after months of cleaning the kitchen sink (stainless), they HAVE left their mark. You can see mild swirl lines and the lustre of the sink is now irretrievably gone. I imagine there is some polish that can fix that, but for now, I limit their use to formica surfaces (for which they are ideal) and pots and pans. Once you've loosened anything in a cook pan, these pads will finish the job in literally a few seconds.To sum up, be careful where you use these (not on stainless fridges, sinks, or other appearance-sensitive objects) and appreciate their gentleness to your hands as you enjoy their abilities."
3,"WRY, WITTY, BUT WRITTEN MORE FOR THE STAGE","Moonstruck and Five Corners are fun reads -- wry and off-beat. Also fun is the introduction written by Shanley, which describes the anxieties, fears, and dating experiences which helped him write these screenplays. Apparently, his writing is very personal. What is disappointing at times is his writing style. The author is a playwright by training and it often shows, particularly in Joe Versus the Volcano -- a very contrived and stagey screenplay."
4,If you like the game 1942,This game is the old school air plane shooter 1942 on steroids. If you are looking for cheap good title for the Neo Geo AES system I recommend picking this title up. It also is two player title the only gripe on this game play the player two plane is the same color as the enemy planes.
4,This is a great book,"This book is what got me started on Haldeman. I was always looking for someone with the talent of Asimov or Heinlein but no one ever seemed to match up. Then someone handed me a copy of ""Worlds"" and that was it. I read ""Worlds Apart"" within days of finish ""Worlds"" and moved on to ready pretty much everything Haldeman wrote.Frankly I find him a little uneven with about 90% of his books being some of the greatest sci-fi ever written and 10% leaving me wondering if I had picked up the wrong author. Well I can assure you this is a great novel worthy of the author of ""The Forever War"", ""Mindbridge"" and ""The Hemmingway Hoax"".If you've read Haldeman you know what I mean. If you are new this is a great place to start."
2,Boring... but the ending was good.,"I read the second book first...So that colors my judgement... The beginning of this book introduced you to the main character O'hara, and was pretty boring. Some of the author's weirdness is to much for me, usually sexually related, making me want to throw the book in the trash. but the last fourth of the book pulled through and made it worth reading."
1,Review of The Social Security Benefits Handbook,"I found this book not to be a good investment. It is an extraction of certain SSA publications, all available in user-friendly format at the official SSA website. The major drawback is that the tables of values for benefits and earnings limits stop at the year 2002. The edition I received in January, 2003 is the third edition dated May, 2002. While the content is current to 2002 and the SSA regulations may not have changed substantially, it is not helpful for referencing 2003 numbers and beyond."
2,The SSA disagrees with Chapter 803.1 prorating,"It appears that Mr. Tomkiel's comments on prorating are incorrect based on several conversations with the SSA. If this information is incorrect, what other portions of this ""Handbook"" are questionable? Can Mr. Tomkiel clarify his position with clear reference to SSA regulations? Does anyone else have experience using the prorating method of payment withholding?"
3,"Good, but does not teach you how to win cases!","This book is nice for those looking for a brief overview of the disability program. For detailed info, I would suggest any of the materials from Disability Associates. This company really teaches you how to win disability cases and be paid for your efforts."
2,Boring,"Sakes alive, I was bored out of my skull. I don't know what I was thinking when I bought this book. I only got through the first chapter or two before my brain started going numb. I'm just 40, so what do I care anyhow. Man, what a waste of $20. Save yourself the pain if you are a youngster like me, and wait and see what transpires over the next decade as the debacle over social security unfolds."
2,Poor Printing,Book was OCR'd from another document and the typo's were frequent and in many cases hard to understand.It was very hard at times to read!
4,Make the Call,"Dr. Reggie Fortune is the most articulate mumbler in detective fiction, and the second most high-spirited grouch (after Nero Wolfe). Readers of the story collection ""Call Mr. Fortune"" will have the pleasure of catching Reggie in his first investigations, before he even knows he's going to have a career as a detective, and at a point where H.C. Bailey most clearly explains Reggie's peculiar mannerisms. The absolute best Mr. Fortune stories are not here, but this early collection is good enough to make you want more--assuming you like early twentieth-century detective fiction, such as Chesterton's Father Brown stories, or Jacques Futrelle's Thinking Machine, or Ernest Bramah's blind detective Max Corrados."
3,It's OK,Not the greatest laugh but good for a few yucks. If the price is right it can also be a good coffee table or waiting room book.
5,WC finally gets one of those Techno thigies..,"FINALLY! Wing Commander finally gets a technical book like the ones in the Star Wars universe. This book is full of rich detail. The pictures are nice, and the extra's like Jump Point physics and analysis of Pilgrim Brain Wave patterns were very nice. McCubbin did a wonderful job with this book"
4,Passable but not as high as expected...,"Although full of incredible images and some fun facts, the handbook is only alright. I was looking for another STAR WARS TECHNICAL MANUAL but I was disappointed by the 'glossy' workmanship inside. Not to say this isn't a good read for WC fans! Many of the areas, like Blair and Maniac's academy forms and the Deck Officer's 21 Rules and Regs is actually quiet fun and Tolwyn's reviews of officers are interesting. A lot of the book could be made better, like the opening interview with Sir Admiral Geoffrey Tolwyn or the layout of the Tiger's Claw. Over all, a disappointing but nessessary book for all WC fans."
4,strange Relations,"This book is for ""old school"" SF readers. If your younger than 40; you might find it unappealing."
1,PU-2 Vacuum Bags,The order was not complete and I returned the order. It was from a third party and I rate the service as poor.
2,Nothing to write home about,The book is easy read but this is because there is not much beef in it. I am a dedicated student of CRM and found this book as just another addition to the mushrooming literature on CRM. The text is wishy-washy but maybe the cases can be found useful. That is all. There are some very good titles on CRM for beginners and I believe this book does not count as one. I do not recommend it to serious CRM readers at all.
4,Your child will be frozen!,"The songs on this video will drive you crazy! They are so annoying, that I gave it 4 stars, but it really should get 5. My son is 21 months old, and he loves this video more than Teletubbies! Your child will actually learn something, too. Just do yourself a favor and keep the volume down."
5,Wonderful Sounds,"Dave Villano is an amazing new age artist. His music is soothing, tranquil, and beautiful. What more can you ask?"
4,Lithium orotate,"My daughter suffers from extreme emotional upheavals. She is a great girl. lovely personality but then in a flash can start thinking that no one loves her and becomes very agitated which at times ends up in a screaming match. She tried Effexor. for a while but that made her drowsy. at present we are trying her on lithium orotate tabs and spray with very limited results. mind you its only been for a couple of weeks but at present she is getting nightmares and i am wondering if this is an after effect. would appreciate comments from anyone else who has a similar problem. thanks,, Zak"
2,Did nothing for me,I noticed nothing when taking this. Maybe the other lithium versions might be helpful like lithium citrate or chloride.
5,Wonderful product,"Excellent product, does just what it says, will definitely order again. Highly recommentd it for those with the issues it addresses."
1,It did nothing for me,"I prayed hard that this lithium would work. It sounded so unbelievably good to be true. I took 2 tabs daily (the recommended dose) for 6 months and it had no effect whatsoever. 3 tabs for 3 months and 4 tabs (double the recomended dose) for 2 months. It did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! Now switching to Lithium Asparate. If that also does not work I'll take Trileptal, the anticonvulsant with the lowest side-effect profile."
5,One of the best big books I've read.,"There are few people who can capture all the complexity and paradox of South Africa in modern times as Brink can. This book may be big but it crystallizes a time in South African history that was very real, scary and complex."
5,Would give this TV 6 or more stars,"This LCD TV is awesome. Speakers mounted under the screen mean it will fit into a tighter space than a TV with side mounted speakers. The glass screen with its special coating make the picture brilliant and eye popping. Reflections are only slightly more than a regular LCD screen and not a problem. It also has a HD TV tuner built in, so you can get the over the air HD TV programing.I would recommend this to anyone. It is the best Syntax Olevia TV I have seen and I already own a 27"" & 37"" Olevia TV.Some complain about the remote & speakers, but the remote is better than my other Olevia TVs and I find the sound from the speakers to be very good to excellent."
2,Reflective screen,"One thing that is not mentioned ANYWHERE is that this television has a glass composite screen. This is NOT typical of LCD TV's. The glass is highly reflective, so this television is completely useless in a well-lit room. It has a great picture, but if your room is bright, you might as well save yourself some money and buy a mirror instead, because that's what it will look like while you're watching tv."
2,Do Not Buy!,"I purchased this item about a year and a half ago due to price and the reviews. While I cant complain for the first year, the TV has developed a problem where it turns itself off all the time. After having two TV repair folks do a complete diagnostic, they havent been able to pinpoint the problem. If I were to change the power supply, it could cost close to 600 bucks with no guarantee to fix the problem. I will buy a brand name TV with better tech support. Olevia's is a joke and they are now bankrupt.."
1,Do not buy Olevia due to lack of service,"I bought an Olevia 42"" in 2007 and it worked fine for approx. 16 months. Currently, it has been in the shop for approx. 6 months. The repair part was very difficult to obtain and failed within a few days of bringing the unit home. The television shop is now having problems getting the parts distributor to warranty the part. The almost complete lack of service/parts availability has convinced me to never buy another Olevia. I suggest that others pay a little higher price and purchase a TV from a reputable company."
1,worst company ever,"i would give this company zero star's if i could... got a tv from them that broke with in 6 month's. got a new one wit the warranty and they put the rest of the existing warranty on it....then that tv broke again in about seven month's...now i'am stuck with a broken tv.....if you like being disrespected by a company after you buy a exspensive item this is the tv for you...i called costumer service and the girl on the the phone actually said "" yeah what cha want"" not may i help you with your problem...they hang up on you after leaving you on hold for a half a hour. so here's your warning pass it on to everyone you know looking to buy a flat panel tv this is the worst company ever...."
1,BEWARE! Syntax Warranty!,"Syntax clearly states that their warranty is only good for the origninal purchaser. I got my daughter one as a gift, gave it to her bran new, in the factory sealed box and Syntax refuses to honor the warranty, (and yes I calld everywere and tried everything)."
1,Disappointed.,"For the price I did not expect a super nice hammer, but still this hammer is a big disappointment. Looks cheap, feels cheap, poorly made, too light, and is loose before I've even used it. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,Too much theory,"The book is supposed to be used for basic, intermediate and advanced users, but is not able to reach its objective. Probably this is the reason it iss so big (1289 pages).Although it comes with a CD, it doesn't use any of the examples that are in it and doesn't propose any exercise, making difficult to understand how MS Project 2000 works.The result is a lot of theory and no hands on."
3,D.O.A.,"Small-town accountant Frank Bigelow goes to San Francisco for a week's fun prior to settling down with fiancée Paula. After a night on the town, he wakes up with more than just a hangover; doctors tell him he's been given a ""luminous toxin"" with no antidote and has, at most, a week to live! Not knowing who did it or why, Bigelow embarks on a frantic odyssey to find his own murderer. Written by Rod Crawford {puffinus@u.washington.edu}"
3,D. O. A.,"This was early in my career as a stuntman. I doubled Edmund O'Brian in the flick...and also, was his stand in. They have remade this picture but I think the original is the best. Lot's of intrigue, etc. The old black and white movies were the best of all. You will enjoy this picture."
1,This Edition Is Garbage.....,"In the ""manner"" of.....more than a milestone of film noir. D.O.A. is all the same, one of a kind.....There's lot's to enjoy throughout.....definitely, check it out......but not with this edition, it sucks.For starters, it's not a ""Region 1"" disc......the source material was evidently in tatters.....the image is loaded with scratches and the sound is tinny.....The producers allowed the copyright to lapse and D.O.A. fell into the public domain quite some time ago. Any fly-by-night outfit can crank out an edition. There are quite a few on the market to choose from......so watch it......a nice edition can be found......but read the fine print carefully....this one ain't it......."
5,ROAN RELEASE!!!!!,The D.O.A. release by Roan and Image of this great film noir are pretty much the same. I would have to recommend the Roan release because of the intro with Beverly Garland. The Image disc has no extras.
3,A Strong Three Stars,"A classic example of 'Film Noir'; a movie where a poisoned man searches for his killer. Contains the immortal line, ""I'm sorry Mister Bigelow -- but you've been murdered."" Please don't view the Quaid/Ryan remake."
5,As perfect a Noir as they come!,"This film has all the classic Noir elements, a character caught in a situation they can't control, unseen enemies and dangers, femme fatale, money, murder, sex, love, no happy endings. And throughout all this, in my opinion, one of the finest peformances by an actor ever caught on film. Edmond O'Brien goes through the emotional roller coster of this role without ever stopping to take a breath. He will have you gasping for your breath up until the last frame. Once the credits start to roll, you will be just as exhausted after having gone on this ride. Then you will know you just watched a masterpiece of what is called Film Noir. It just doesn't get any better than this."
2,Roan DVD-R,"This is not a review of the movie but of the Roan release. As of March 2012 (and probably earlier), Roan/Troma is selling theirs on DVD-R, which was not mentioned in Amazon's listing, or by the Marketplace seller I used. Roan's release has some marginal extras, which may make it the more coveted version, but if DVD/DVD-R is important to you, consider the Image DVD instead, or inquire with used sellers. I will be returning this DVD-R."
5,Narnia Beckons,"C. S. Lewis was able to communicate the mysteries of the Kingdom of God by following the example of Jesus Christ who spoke in parables. His writings were uniquely inspired by the Holy Spirit who is the master communicator reaching beyond the veils that blind the eyes and minds of mankind in a world of darkness. The sword of Truth alone is able to divide between darkness and light, and set the captives free. Ted Baehr and his son Jim are to be commended for creating a magnificent synopsis of the life and literary works of C. S. Lewis in ""Narnia Beckons."" We thank the entire Baehr family for the great influence they contribute to the realm of communication."
3,Great Disc,This is a great disc. I whole heartedly review with the former reviewer -- there is so much diversity to just the music of Ghana alone that there is no way to classify it all under one category. So you will need to stretch out and purchase a bunch of different discs with various different styles. This is a good one.
3,"""I may not know much, but I know about yoyos!""","This is quite a sweet Australian family movie about a bumbling con artist who turns out to have a heart of gold. Nice assortment of crazy provincials, good performances all around. Karen Allen shines, Bryan Brown seems to be a kind of Austalia's answer to Michael Cane. He has a good voice and a few good lines (see title which has to be understood quite literally and is followed by a stunning performance by Brown with said toy)."
4,"Fun, Quick and Thought Provoking Read","Chalker deals with a lot of interesting issues (the nature of reality, sex roles and biases, theology, good and evil, etc.) in a highly accessible and entertaining manner. Worth reading and worth recommending to your friends."
3,Interesting but Auk-ward,"This book was a good continuation of the previous story, and certainly made me think. But while I applaud Chalker's work, I have to point out that there were several editing problems that should've been resolved and weren't--such as confusing switches back and forth between names (Maddox/Maddux, for instance) without explanation."
1,Classic Album / Awful Remaster,"As stated in the previous reviews, this indeed is a psychedlic soul classic. However I picked up this Westbound re-issue at a retail shop in NYC and was mortified at how poor the sound was. My wife thought I was playing a worn cassette.I'm no audiophile, but the quality of this so-called remaster is not worth purchasing. I'm keeping an eye out for a used vinyl copy at local antique shops and fairs. I hope this record will get a proper re-issue akin to the great Sony Legacy series, or Rhino."
4,Old Fashion Vampire,"I was expecting a bit more from this book. If you want one that isnt bloody, this is your read. Takes place a few centuries ago. Parts made me gag at how 'delicate' was the female bitten. Men were kind of sissy."
4,Worthy read,"Everyone pretty much said it all. Starts off interesting and then gets complicated. Worth reading, but it is a long story. The ending is predictable, but there is plenty of vampire shananigans throughout for vampire addicts. Try to get this free if you can...it's available from feedbooks. (reviewed from Kindle 2)."
1,where are the negitive stars?,this book starts out with young flora sleeping. the vampire comes and bites her the only thing i could think of was dracula.... im glad this book was free and very suprised by the other two high ratings. very disapointed
1,This book left me wanting more....because there is more,"What the heck happened to the last 341 pages of the book? No wonder it's free. And it's a good thing too. I won't feel bad deleting it from my kindle library. Don't get me wrong I like the book,but not this free one."
1,Kindle edition is incomplete,"I love Varney the Vampire, but the Kindle edition is actually the version compiled by Project Gutenberg, which is missing something like the last third of the existing chapters. I know it's free and you get what you pay for, but it's a disappointment nonetheless. Back to the actual paper edition for me."
5,Varney the Vampire (kindle),"I enjoyed this book very much. Although I was never completely convinced of Varney's authenticity as an honest-to-goodness blood-sucking immortal vampire, he played the part so well! I really found myself rooting for him. The dim-witted villagers were entertaining in their fits of ""fire & pitchfork"" mob mentality, and I love that there were so many vampire origin folk tales cited that I had never heard of before(moonlight?). My absolute favorite characters were Admiral Bell & Jim - their swash-buckling lingo and constant bickering was hilarious. This is a fun book and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys vintage horror."
4,Helpful only to a degree......,"This book does give insight into the disease the experience your loved one is going through. However, it lacks in practical information as the disease progresses."
4,Alzheimer's,Helpful and I gave copies to the children of parents dealing with this disease. Very helpful to caregivers and family members
1,the,I ordered the book 1/10 it said it would ship within 24 hours - the book didn't arrive until 2/3/09 - and I paid 3.99 s/h cost - this has been the worst excuse for Customer Service that I've ever seen - the book cost me 5.99 - for an extra 6 cents I could have driven to Barnes & Knoble to buy it directly -- You'll not have my business againCatherine J Kostrzeski
3,"Don't be fooled - ""2008 publication"" Big deal still just a 4th edition!","I returned the 4th edition I had recently purchased because this items description was, ""The 36-hour Day - Completely Revised and Updated --2008 publication."" Naturally I belived it to be a newer edition than what I had. Not the case at all. The contents of the book are exactly the same as the 4th edition. I essentially wasted my time and money returning the 4th edition to receive the same book with a different cover and publisher. Talk about a misleading product description. Let the buyer beware and base your purchase on price and not the cover or publisher."
4,The 36-Hour Day,"This is one of the most informative and helpful books I have read in a long time. It is one that most people will find some help from, I plan to recommend it to as many as I can."
4,"The 36-Hour Day: A Family Guide to Caring for Persons with Alzheimer Disease, Related Dementing Illnesses, and Memory Loss",This book had been recommended to me. I bought the book as a gift for a care giver. The care giver said the book was very informative.
5,Excellent Reference,"The 36-hour day is an excellent reference about the many forms of dementia and what can be done for both patients, family and caregivers."
2,Bleak depths,"I couldn't finish the book. Lars Tobiasson-Svartman is a methodical depth sounder with myriad personal issues. He has an interesting job during the backdrop of a developing war. Lars is morose, petulant, duplicitous and his personal issues and decisions take center stage. After a while I could not summon up the interest to continue reading the book.I'm going to have to check out the Wallender series as Mankell seems to be a well regarded author. I think it takes a die-hard fan to get through this book. While well written and having interesting short chapter lengths, the development of the main character will either intrigue or repulse you."
4,Different...,"It kept drawing me into it, although it is not like most of his other novels. Different and interesting..I liked it !"
3,"The good, the bad and the ugly","I was really looking forward to reading Deep. It is centered around a time period and events that have long fascinated me. In that I wasn't disappointed.The Good: This translation appears to be quite good and I enjoyed the writing, as I always do with Mankell's work. The characters intensified the wonderful descriptions of the gray, cold setting. There's nothing that chills to the bone quite like a cold, northern ocean. Even the humans added no warmth, which brings me to The Bad and The Ugly: I realized about half way through that I was spending many hours with people I didn't like. I hate spending money on a book and then not reading it, so I forced myself to slog on. Only the writing saved it for me, even the descriptions of characters I found loathsome. I guess that cinches it - I'm a fan of Mankell."
4,Get lost in the detail.,"This book is full of detail so you feel like you are on a journey of discovery in much more than the story of the characters. I discovered some history, some geography and about ships sort of. Very interesting. I was disappointed that the story didn't finish. I wanted to know what happened to the woman at the beginning if the story. I needed more."
2,Are you sure that Henning Mankell wrote this?,I am such a huge fan of Henning Mankell and was so very disappointed in this book. I couldn't finish it. I was reading it on my iPad and checked the front of the book to make sure this was by Mankell.
1,"Noir, very noir","Probably this novel is very well written. But... the character is very dark and gets worse as the story evolves. Mankell has written many delightful stories. Wallander and non Wallander like The Man From Beijing. Mr Mankell can certainly weave a story and in Depths he does that superbly, though not to my liking."
2,bury it deep,Can not say much good about this one. Hard story to like and images didn't work. Short chapter format showed weakness in structural continuity.
3,Depths - Mankell,Mankell is a complex writer which sometimes results in complex novels such as this one. While it held my attention Depths is not the type story I look to Mankell for. I much prefer his Kurt Walander series.
2,i can;t believe he wrote the whole thing,"so disappointed in the book, not up to notch...characters were not believeable especially the wife...so sorry"
2,disappointing mankell searching new depths,I ahve read all of Henning Mankels books in English and have thoroughly enjoyed them until now. Depths disappoints at many levels and I wonder if Mr Mankel has grown bored with the writing that has made him famous and now seeks literary acclaim. If this book was written by anyone else it would probably receive favourable reviews as an arty literary fable ......but I wouldn't have bought it. Please Mr Mankel if you have a need to write such turgid nonsense do so under another name and spare your fans. (I even enjoyed return of the Dancing master!)
1,Stinks,"I purchased this book for book club. It was the worst book I ever tried to read. It was soo poorly written, I didn't even finish it! The format was hard...it didn't flow because the author chose to have paragraphs for chapters and the main character was an idiot. I wasn't really into the sailor lingo either.The person who recommended the book for our group was a no show...go figure! On a positive note, I love our group and really enjoyed the conversation and their interpretation of the novel. We rated it out of a 1 to 5 a 2.Thank you,Riley"
4,Excellent work,"Full of wonderful short creative non-fiction pieces.Highlights for me:Remembering I was Not There - Anne Panning, a wonderfully creative piece about parents before her birth.Fury and Grace - Pattiann Rogers growing up, becoming a woman and water.Dream Houses - Tenaya Darlington, reminiscence of houses/places/siblings growing up, and why reality is the dream.The Indian Dog - N. Scott Momaday, about will, determination and doing what one must do.The Deck - Yusef Komunyakaa, an excellent rememberance of a father in so few words...amazing!"
4,Short Stuories,This is a great book to just read short different stories. I used this book in my undergraduate class to learn how to develop my own personal skilled in writing and to be able to make a story interesting even if it was short.
5,Useful tips for getting organized at work and home,"There are lots of tips on this tape. I haven't had time to try them all out, but the ones I have tried work! I feel more organized already. It's a tape you'll want to listen to more than once. It helps that Stephanie has a very pleasant voice."
4,"Good for toast, but not poptarts","I got this as a Christmas present two years ago, because I'm a fan of Disney princesses. I immediately took it home to try it out and was delighted with not only the imprint of the shoe (though it works best on white toast, and I eat wheat), but the music, as well. One thing I don't recommend for it is poptarts. Sometimes when I make them, the poptarts fall through the grate inside, getting stuck, and making a mess. I still have bits of poptart stuck in the bottom of my toaster. Other than that, I adore it!"
1,"Great picture at first, but there are issues with Samsung DLPs","When it works the picture quality is outstanding but the sound quality is poor for a tv that cost $3500 when purchased. My tv developed a dark bar on the left side of the screen after 15 months (out of warranty). It turns out that this is a known issue these tv's and well documented in several online forums. It seems there is some glue that secures small mirrors in the unit that fails causing the mirrors to move. This causes the ""shadow"" issue along the sides of the screen. It is clearly a design flaw but Samsung will not acknowledge it. The result is a very expensive repair. I do not recommend this TV and personally will never buy anything Samsung again because of the way I was treated by thier customer service."
1,Problems with Samsung DLP television,"I enjoyed my Samsung HLP6163W 61 inch DLP television until it failed fourteen months after purchase and two months after expiration of the Samsung warranty. The ""light engine"" failed. Repair, with labor and tax is approximately $1900-- nearly half of the original purchase price of the television. Take the time to review internet forums on Samsung DLP televisions. This type of failure appears to be very common.I have contacted Samsung corporation about warranty extension and repair. They refuse to even consider my request, despite the fact that many people on Samsung DLP internet forums feel Samsung knew during the manufacturing of this product it would experience early extensive failure. There is even talk of class action lawsuits. Hey, it is two months out of warranty, so tough luck, customers.I now am in possession of high priced inoperable junk. My next television? A Sony!"
1,$40 for a shipping knife?,"I was going to rate this item 4, maybe 5 stars, but I see the price has gone WAY up since I purchased it. I can't justify a fourty-dollar box-cutting kife to ANYONE!! It's a fine knife, but I would happily pay $5 for it again (maybe $10 if I'm feeling spendy)."
3,"Good, but not up to par for Harvey Danger.","I absolutely loved King James Version. It would probably apear on my top ten albums. I loved how they retained their edginess from Where have all the merrimakers gone and still they progressed as a band by maturing with their lyrics and style. That said, I just can't get into their new album. I think I may have hyped it up for myself too much, so I may have to come back and change this from 3 to 4 in a couple of months. They lost a star out of disappointmen I think. Their edginess is gone and the mellow tracks that I enjoyed amongst the harder tracks have taken over for this album. Has Harvey Danger gone easy listening? I'm afraid I think that Harvey Danger should have stopped with their second and best album."
1,Prolix.,"I very much enjoyed Andric's ""The Bridge Over the Drina"", but reluctantly gave up on this book after 104 prolix pages. This is one of those cases where an abridged version would be a definite improvement. Incidentally, the version I read was translated by Kenneth Johnstone, and was entitled ""Bosnian Story"" instead of ""Bosnian Chronicle""."
4,Pack a dictionary and a spirit guide to help with this one,"A great guide to understanding how people can interact with eachother on a different level of consciousness. This book reads backwards though, and can be very confusing to read at first. But by the time you reach the end, it's like you've reached the begining. This book actually saved my sanity, by helping me to understand the changes I am going through, if you have similar troubles, read this book! If you buy this book expecting to learn telepathy, your in for a shock. This book doesn't tell the reader (directly) how to gain this new ""insight"", but rather, why it is. Basically if you don't already 'get it' you won't 'get it'. The ""Science of Impression"" marches on"
3,Optional read in the Childe Cycle,"This book has to do with the struggle on Dorsaii prior to the time of Dorsaii (the book with that name). The heroine of this tale is good background information for Final Encyclopedia. I thought the book was a little dry, sexist, and primative. It is not one of the better books in the series. You could read this book at any point in the series since it is out of the timeline of the main storyline"
1,Didn't do any magic for me.,"Didn't do any magic for me.. I didn't bother buying extra bottles, to either find out or to waste further money... I've got a pretty severe sinus problem."
5,An excellent product!,I have purchased this product several time and one that I will never be without as long as I can afford to purchase in the future.
3,Don't take if on certain blood pressure medicine,"The label warned not to take this if on blood pressure medicine, so it's my fault for trying. In my case, I take 10 grams of lisinopril a day for blood pressure, which is a fairly low dose, yet after taking this product I had an elevated heart rate and difficulty sleeping and the tinnitus was actually worse.It wouldn't be fair to rate this 1 star based on my situation, considering I was warned. Since I have to give a rating in order to write a review I'll give it 3 stars, since it seems to work for other people.The purpose of this review is not to give a star rating, but to warn people with high blood pressure that this product may make your situation worse."
5,yum,"I love these pamela's cookies. Her other cookies and biscotti are good too. I would order these again. Some flavors are not available in stores. They are a little softer than regular shortbread cookies, not as crisp, but still have a good taste and flavor and it's easy to eat too many."
4,Great Gluten free cookie,Yes! It is not like a home baked old fashion cookie but a cookie that is good and satisfies that need for a sweet. It is a little crumbly. YES it is A great wheat free and gluten free cookie but Each cookie has 130 calories and 70 fat calories out of the 130. Not a diet cookie; with 5g of sugar. I highly recommend this cookie for all people who need A great wheat free and gluten free cookie.
2,too crumbly and dry,"While the overall flavor of these cookies is OK ... the texture is too crumbly and - somehow - they manage to be dry even though slightly moist at the same time. Also, there are only NINE cookies per box."
2,High Price for Low Quality,"These cookies are not of the quality I have come to expect with Pamela's Products. In addition, there are only 9 cookies per box.I regularly use the bread and flour packages that Pamela's Products produces and highly recommend them. These cookies fall short of quality.If you need to be gluten free, and in desperate need of a cookie only then would I recommend these."
1,Awful texture and taste,"The cookies are inedible. I was shocked after all the high reviews. The consistency is nothing like shortbread, or any other cookie for that matter."
3,If you REALLY love butter...,"You will like these. They are rich and heavy. Soft and chewy. They are not low-fat.Personally, I prefer the crunchier pecan varieties."
4,Does what it's supposed to do,"Bought this card for my Nikon D40 digital camera and it has performed flawlessly thus far. I have been able to take continuous photos at fairly fast speeds although this is partially a function of the camera as well as the card so it's hard to say here.Buying from Amazon allowed me to save a lot of money from retail stores, some of whom are charging almost $70 for this item."
4,"High quality, cheap price","The price is good, and the memory has been error-free. There's not much more to say.The packaging seems a little overkill. The pouch, huge manual and accompanying software all seem so unnecessary - not that most everything isn't overpackaged lately though."
1,Not Worth the price,I have 2 of them and they have started giving me problems already in less than 4 months they have a problem when you are trying to transfer the pictures from SD to hard drive. I have Extreme 2 and thats working great. So i will recomened to go with extreme2 and save money it has no difference in speed i m using them with Nikon D80.
2,Andorama,"I purcased a digital camera and a 2GB Scandisk from Amazon and should have received it in 2 days on November 25, 2007. I received the camera within the specified time from Amazon but it took Andorama (must be Amazon partners) 3 weeks to ship the ScanDisk 2GB. When I called their Customer Service they said I should return it however, it shoud have to be done in 7 days and I would have to pay the postage. I had already bought a ScanDisk card from a local store. I don't have any issues with the ScanDisk card. I decided not to send the card back since the cost of the postage and Andorama's charges would have left me with hardly any money back. Now I have 2 x 2Gb ScanDisk cards! Check your shipments and take action if what you ordered is not received in timely manner."
2,Not worth it,"You can get more memory for less. Honestly, how many people will ever drop this chip from 10'000 ft or subject their digital camera to 50F below zero? The new SDHC chips, especially category 6, have a minimum 4GB capacity, are faster, and cost less."
5,SanDisk is the Best,What is there to say really. SanDisk makes the best memory cards in the industry. 10 out of 10 product.
1,Beware of Sandisk cards!,"Sandisk has some screwy problem with these and other SD cards.Not many readers will see it or read it.Even the SANDISK reader can't read it!It could be that Sandisk went down the drain as a quality product or these and other Sandisk labeled cards are fakes.I have NO proof just make an assumption that it could happen!Ya know, the cheapest No-Name brands work just fine for me, everytime and it's half price or less.This is the last time I ever buy any SD card from Sandisk.."
1,Ordered a CF & Received a SD,I ordered a CF & Received a SD. Amazon was extremely nice about correcting the problem. A pleasant surprise in online shopping.
5,Fast and reliable,I use this in a canon IS S3 camera it is very fast and I have had no data loss in either pictures or movies.
5,Review,The product came to me within a day. The store must be in California.I was pleased with the promptness of delivery. Would definitely purchase again from this company.
3,NOT COMPATIBLE WITH SONY VAIO SD READER,I like this SD SANDISK very much since we can store more photos.But since it is 2 GB Sony VAIO SD reader could not read the DISKSo i went for 1 GB SD SANDISK. We can store upto 400 photos alsoit is compatible with SONY VAIO.
1,"Buyer Beware, Dissatisfied Customer","I place an order through Amazon and when my shipment arrived I received two orders from Adorama. I contacted the company and they informed me to ship the 2nd item back (at my cost) and they would refund my credit card. Three weeks after I mailed the item I received my credit card bill that still reflected the charge. I contacted Adorama, they claim that they never received the shipment and I would need to deal with Amazon (very rude staff). I contacted Amazon and through their A to Z Guarantee and would investigate the issue. After a few days of investigation they denied my claim due to insufficient evidence of delivery, basically calling me a liar. I will never do business with Amazon or Adorama again and I would warn others of the poor customer service practice that these companies practice. I am a dissatisfied customer. Only reason they received ""one star"" rating is ""no stars"" was not an option."
2,Pointless for older Cameras,"I purchased this because my camera is several years old and the maximum card it will accept is 2GB and I also thought the added bonus of being able to take shots a little quicker would be great. Sadly, this isn't any quicker shooting photos (or uploading them) than the regular card I bought over 4 years ago. While I'm sure this is mostly due to my camera hardware, if you do have a newer camera capable of taking advantage of this card's extra speed, why would you want to settle for just 2GB? This is a semi-pointless product - Just go for a card with larger capacity."
2,Sandisk Extreme III SD Card,"I purchased a 2Gb Extreme III SD Card, and it stores the images taken with my DSLR, but it does not display the files in my PC, through the Sandisk usb adapter. Therefore, I have to plug the camera directly to the PC. It is very inconvenient."
5,Get It!!!,"You'll be the happiest SanDisk 2 GB Extreme III SD Memory Card owner. I'm tellin' you, you'll love its performance. Get it!!!"
5,"If I had the choice, of course I would buy it again!","I've had 3 Sandisk Extreme memory cards already... Everytime I've sold my cameras, including this chip increases my selling price and buyers actually accept this without a doubt.Nowadays my camera is a 12MP Lumix... Works great with this card; you can be sure your pictures won't suffer from any malfunctioning of these piece. Sure bet. Can't miss."
5,SanDisk 2 GB Extreme III SD Memory Card,Received item as advertised in a very timely matter; am very happy with the product and the process of purchasing it.
5,Best memory I've used so far,Using this memory in Canon SD1000. Great refresh rate and absolutely no glitches so far. Worth the extra $$.
4,As advertised...fast!,"Well this card is fast as advertised...It addressed the lag/delay issue I was having with taking photos in a Canon IS5, so well in fact that I purchased a second card to alleviate a map loading issue that I kept getting when using a slower SD card in my Garmin iQue 3600 GPS.Worth the money, in spite of it being about twice as expensive as bargain cards - but you do however get what you pay for. Unless using an SD card for audio/MP3, save yourself the headaches & pony up just a little more money as your Camera/PDA or GPS device will reward you back accordingly!!!!I gave it 4 out of 5 stars, only due to the higher price."
3,Less than EXTREME but adequate,"Got this for my Canon 720i camera thinking it would be really fast to save photos. Well, it's notl too quick. Expect fairly long delays if you're using the flash; but it performs well and 2 gb is very sufficient."
4,good product with high storage,inspite of being small it has a great storage capacity...i simply use it without the fear that it will be full..till now its going great...good product..transfer speed is amazing...recommended for all digital camera users..
5,Excellent Performance,Card loads and accesses pictures rapidly and extremely quickly. Fantastic performance. Would recommend to anyone wanting performance.
4,"Blazingly Fast, and long lasting.","I've had my card for nearly four years, and it's like new. It's faster than the class 10 Transcend sd card I just purchased. Write/Read speeds of 18.4/19.2 mbs for my card. The only reason I didn't give it five stars, is that the price for these cards is high, compared to similar speed and size sd cards."
3,Slower than the Extreme II in my camera,"I've loved the speed of the SD Extreme II, so was happy to snatch up the Extreme III for a good price.Unfortunately, even after formatting, this card is slower than my Extreme II during picture capture, making multiple shots noticeably more difficult.The time from power-on to first click is slightly slower also.So, I'll use this in my iPaq, and keep using the old Extreme II for photo work."
5,2 GB SD Memory,"The card works great; but I consider the buying experience deceitful. Amazon sent me a notice that the product would not ship for a month and asked if I would wait. Foolishly, I answered ""Yes"". I then shopped elsewhere where I found it for 30% less than Amazon's price, so I bought it there. I then went to cancel the Amazon order (less than 3 hours after answering ""yes"" to the ""will you wait?"" notice) and was told that I could not cancel because the order had been sent to fulfillment. Amazon lowered its price the next day, but charged me the old price. Beware of this bunch; I don't trust them anymore -- and you shouldn't either."
2,I started to have problems with it,"I used it for a couple of weeks ,and after that it suddenly started to work unproperly:deleting some of my photots,transforming them into some other king of file(not jpg),so Iost a few great memories like this.Otherwise it is a good card,but I don't no,I hope not every one of them has my problem."
2,Careful with this one,I wanted to use this card with a digital picture frame. It can not be read in my Belkin card reader. Can not be opened or formatted. It works okay in my Kodak camera but I didn't really want to install the camera software if I didn't have to since I have the card reader.
4,Extreme III SD card does the trick,Faster than the SanDisk Ultra II and priced to make you want to use more of them.
4,go with the Class 6 memory,"I Have no prob w/ this memory, fast, good movies, I personally cannot tell the diff between it and class 6, but might as well get the newest memmory in case you want to use in an updated camera that requires it later on... the spec is different and old card readers will not work w/ the class 6, so that is a pain, but that also proves there is a real difference."
3,Not worth the price,I bought the Extreme III because it was supposed to have faster write time so you can take pictures faster. I did not see any differance between this item and the Ultra II Sandisk. Not worth the extra cost.
5,Quick and versatile,"This is the first time I have tried the Extreme III cards. I always used Ultra IIs and was happy. But these cards are definitely faster. I have one in my Vista laptop and it does make a difference using it as Ram Boost. And the one in my S5IS camera doesn't make the camera any faster than the Ultra IIs but download to the computer is definitely faster. For the price difference with the IIs, I'll take the IIIs anytime."
5,Get two,"This card is a winner, I chose it because of the claim that it would work in ""Extreme"" temperatures. It does all that and it transfers faster than expected."
5,The best SD card,Great speed and reliability. What more could you want in a SD card? Only better price maybe. But it worth each dollar!
3,More space!,This was great! fastest shutter speeds was possible with the extreme cards as pictures were writtenn on to it twice as fast. Would definitely get another one of there (but would wait till they come up with a larger capacity)
5,"Great book, good narrator",Bernard Cornwell is the best at what he does and the is a great book. The narrator is very good too.
1,Please do due dilligence and research the DANGERS OF FLUORIDE for yourself.,"Don't let others tell you what fluoride is and does, take your own health into your hands and do responsible research. It will only take a few hours to learn that fluoride is a dangerous neurotoxin and listed by the FDA as an un-tested drug. Health Canada claims that it is ""VERY TOXIC"". As little as 7 drops is lethal. Fluoride has been scientifically proven to cause bone cancer, lower IQ, increase heavy metals adsorption, inhibit over 60 enzymes needed in your body, and other cognitive problems and damage to organs. Fluoride was first used in nazi concentration camps to keep prisoners docile. If you don't believe me read some of the books on fluoride and do your own research. or you can check websites such as fluoridealert.org"
1,The Worst Tolkien Scholarship I've Ever Seen!,"As a student and employee of Marquette University, I am grateful to William Ready for his foresight in acquiring the Tolkien manuscripts. (How he managed to do so is still beyond me! But as far as understanding Tolkien's work -- Ready does not. The research is sloppy, there are factual inaccuracies and his understanding of the role of Catholicism in Tolkien (both his life and in his work) is faulty. This is probably the single worst piece of Tolkien literary criticism that I have ever read.It is interesting to note that the book is panned in Carpenter's official biography of Tolkien. Apparently the family had the same view of the book as I do!"
3,johnny b// 2 great spaghetti westerns,"Well, I've always gave WILD EAST DVD'S good reviews inthe past,But,I guess it is my turn to get a defective DVD.The last 20 minutes of PAYMENT IN BLOOD was really fustratingfor me to watch.Such as,like,watching TV on satellight cable,then you loose the signal and the the pixels pop up on the screenand then fade out and loose reception.Mean while the chapters ofthe movie skip around and go into freeze mode all the way tothe end of the movie.And also in the beginning of RED BLOODYELLOW GOLD,the first 20 minutes of the movie.REALLY,REALLYfustrating.I would give these 2 westerns and WILD EAST's DVDa five star,but??????Can't get a response back from wild east,still waiting to hearback from Amazon."
5,Everyhing I needed to get through TTC,"THis book offered everything I needed to guide me emotionally and spiritually for getting through trying to conceive. Every time I started to feel hopeless, a friend getting pregnant and me still TRYING, another negative pregnancy test, etc. I could turn to this book and find a moment that I could relate to. SHe covers it all - there's something in this book for everyone. Her journey is inspiring and comforting, giving hope for your personal infertility struggles. The prayers are written out and help guide your personal time with God. I recommend this book to ANYONE who is hurting and desires to find peace and comfort through God."
1,Critique of hyper-dispensationalism,"I read the online version on the Trinity College website and was dismayed to find wildly inaccurate information given on the positions held by hyper or ultra-dispensationalism. The whole section titled ""A Warning against Hyper-Dispensationalism"" shows a total ignorance of their teachings and supporting arguments. Unfortunately such incompetence (or just laziness to do proper research or really some research) seems to be typical when it comes to critiques of hyper-dispensationalism. I have yet to find any writer who competently and genuinely interacts with the positions (Mid-Acts and Acts 28) and I should really like to find one. Hopefully the rest of the book fares better in evidencing a modicum of scholarly research."
1,Warning Warning Danger Will Robinson!,"Wow, what a piece of garbage. Get this only if you have money you need to get rid of or an hour of your life you need to waste. This wasn't even bad in a cheesy way, it was just bad. There's no lecture. There's a guy standing behind a black spot pretending like he's talking while there's a bad overdub of the same tired old stuff, with occasional applause and someone coughing to convince you it's real. Save yourself the trouble and watch an old rerun of Hawaii 50. How do you make this thing say 0 stars?"
3,"Beautiful artwork, confusing as hell..and a little uncomfortable","I am going to play devil's advocate here because everyone can't say enough about this manga and it really didn't do much for me. Granted, I am just getting into manga, but this story line just was completely lost on me and I spent the first chapter or so trying to figure out what the hell was going on. There is an uncomfortable pedophillic-S&M-master/slave theme in the book and a little bit of like pokemon trainer thrown in. Plus, the people are cats? And they lose their ears when they transition from childhood to adulthood (presumably by losing their virginity). My inability to understand what was going on really made this a frustrating read for me. I don't discourage anyone from trying this one out, because obviously it is quite popular, however, make sure you know what you're getting into. Artwork: A+, Story: C, Overall: B"
3,Different,The book is good.. Not too sure about some parts but its grown on me and i think i will get the second one to see what happens. I really wasn't expecting what i read. Ritsuka is going through some rough times death of his brother and an abusive mom he gets involved in a world of magic. He meets a friend of his brothers and things pick up from here.
3,"Good Perry Mason, but not Great Perry Mason","This book had all the twists and turns you expect from a Perry Mason Mystery, but lacked some of the charm. The court case, which is always my favorite part of a Perry Mason book, does not come until close to the end, and Mr. Mason does not have that much a part in it-Which is an interesting turn that makes most of the otherwise kind of boring story, worth reading. All said, it is an entertaining story, but far from Mr. Gardner's best work."
2,good detective-good story,"storyline is good as always when written by rex stout,but the condition of the book was fair"
1,Worthless,"do you want to know the secrets to a happy, healthy and obedient boxer? well if so, then don't bother buying this worthless book because they are not going to tell you anything you don't already know or couldn't find out for free in one search on Google.don't believe me? well you can prove it to yourself and also back this review up with your own thoughts.do a Google search for ""Boxer Dogs"" bring up the first 15 links that Google suggests and read all of those WebPages, that will take you about two hours, then do one more search of Boxer Dog Health Problems and read a couple of those links. after you have that all done, buy this book and read it. by the time you make it half way into this 59 page book, you will be sure that the author did the same Google search that you did, then he copied and pasted it all together and suckered you into buying it.enjoy!"
4,Dark...,"This is a more listenable effort than the debut album, ""Livonia""but still should barely be classifiable as ""music""...It's more like ethereal sounda art, dreamscapes, spoken word with acoustic guitar wafting in and out over atmospheric distortion.Karin's voice sounds more confident than ""Livonia"", but still a little to trite for my taste. I mean, ""this Mortal Coil"" had a little more soul...NOT FOR BEGINNERS IMHO...I'd recommend""Mouth by Mouth""""Stars on ESP""or""Ft Lake""Thank you!"
5,Just what I needed,These tweezers are just what I needed. They perform all sorts of useful tasks - holding a small sponge that I can use to clean the inside of tight-necked hummingbird feeders; pulling canning jars out of boiling water; reaching far up into the bagless vacuum to pull out all the fur and forest litter; reaching into the vent to pull out a chewy the dog tossed in; and so many other things.And they clean up very easily in the kitchen sink or the dishwasher.
4,Not the best for tissue culture,"I had hoped to save money by buying these tweezers as the cheapest ones intended for use in plant tissue culture are about $30 and go over $120 bc they are heavier to resist metal fatigue, etc.I haven't tried to used them yet, however, I think they may be easier to use but won't last as long.We'll see."
5,great product,works great! Son loves it for holding bugs for examination! Do not hesitate to purchase. The length is perfect and it grips just enough.
2,cheap,"I bought this very cheap and so goes the quality, it's not stainless and I could see, smell and feel the stain on mine after about 2 weeks of using.."
3,"Worth the read, a little too fluffed.","Aside from a minor time inaccuracy (within the first couple pages) the author's diary approach seemed a bit unauthentic. Perhaps I am too far removed from being so young, but even as the book moves on I wonder if I teen would really write so... young-like? Rather than wanting to cry ""Eat! Eat!"" by the end, I wanted to cry ""Mature! Mature!"" Getting past these things I did enjoy reading the book. As with many of these books she just seems to fall into her disorder, and it is obvious here.I liked it."
3,A Simplistic Description of Anorexia,"Morgan Menzie's efforts in putting words to her eating disorder are heroic. I flew threw the book in only a few days and was drawn in by the diary style of the book. The story was simple and ordinary. A little too ordinary, however. Although I understand that the story was, for the most part, a true story, I found it hard to buy into the reality of the main character developing an eating disorder. Yes, ""Blythe"" was rejected by boys and had trouble making friends, but really... that would drive someone to anorexia? For a more sympathetic read, try Wasted by Marya Hornbacher, or Loss and Found by Karen Flyer. Both of these memoirs are far more believable and compelling stories of adolescent angst and eating disorders."
3,Disapointed,I didn't really enjoy this book. It is what I would call light reading. Not too much emotion or character development.
2,Not what I thought,"This book was not about what I thought it would be. She barely talks about having an eating disorder. Its more about her life with her friends, family, and school, which is fine, but thats what most teen books are about. I think that The Best Little Girl in the World gives a better understanding of what having an eating disorder means."
3,Worth your time!,I read this book a year ago and by far it is one of my most favorites. Over a time period of four years i was anorexic and to see that i was not the only only one and that someone has had it a lot worse than me shows that i can make it. I recommemnd this book to all teenage girls everywhere. Even if they are not anorexic or do not think they have a weight problem it will make them understand how t help people around them who are!
3,average,"The content of the book was alright but I found a few big typos that drove me crazy. Also, I realize the book is fiction and just based on the writers experience but she should have wrote it more in the voice of the child that she was when all the stuff happened. Overall the book was okay but not amazing."
3,Notice of compatability,Even though it is not stated on the product page this program is incompatible with FSX.You should be aware of that.
2,Great Smell - but read all ingredients - says fragrance ??,"When I called Jason company and asked what exactly does ""fragrance"" mean? they said - made up of synthetic and natural stuff"" Thought Jason was suppose to be clean and chemical free. Synthetic means chemicals!!!"
4,Solid Effort From Mr. Stamey,"I'm a huge fan of The dB's and Holsapple and Stamey's two albums. However, other than It's Alright, which I consider a nearly perfect pop masterpiece, I have found Chris Stamey's albums to be very uneven. One or two gems among a lackluster collection of songs. I'm happy to say that I found Travels In The South to be a consistently solid effort. While the songs are not as memorable as It's Alright, they are all enjoyable. There are even a couple of instrumental tracks that seamlessly blend in during a complete airing of the album. Nice addition to my collection."
1,False advertising,"I ordered this blue filter for the surefire flashlight specifically because it stated that it was a ""slip-on FLIP-UP"" filter. I paid more for this blue filter than I did for the red one because of the ""FLIP-UP"" option on it. IT IS EXACTLY the same thing as the red one only it costs more. IT DOES NOT FLIP-UP as stated in the advertisement. It is simply a slip-on. The advertising is completely FALSE."
5,A lovely retelling of the Bros. Grimm tale,The story is well written and easy to read aloud. The illustrations and story are for the older toddler who will appreciate the band of friends and understand the ageist theme. Beautiful illustrations.
2,Pretend glue,"I followed the instructions but found this glue to be not. That is, it didn't hold. Now maybe it works great on waders where there is no torque on the material, but on my Muck boots it lasted for a day and then simply gave it up.Very frustrating."
2,Dinosaurs are Different,"Returned the book...too complicated for pre-school aged children. The concept that different types of dinosaurs have bone structures that predict their stature and teeth that predict eating habits can be better presented. If done well these concepts can even be understood by pre-schoolers who love dinosaurs. This book is a ""loser""."
5,Little Log Book with Great Big Art,"This was a fantastic recent find at a used bookstore. The art is amazing. The story...so-so. I bought it for the art. Visually stunning, Henrik Drescher is someone I'm going to pay attention to in the future."
1,Do not buy from this vendor.,"Do not buy from this vendor. If there is a problem you must contact the vendor Thermite directly. You don't go through Amazon and consequently are at Thermite's mercy for any response whatsoever. I thought I was getting a different edition of a book I wanted. It may well have been my mistake but I thought perhaps I could return the book for a restocking fee, or a credit of some kind? The vendor did not even reply to my inquiry. VERY VERY BAD."
2,I did *not* enjoy this book,"Smoky the Cowhorse is a boring book. I mean it. I'm a very patient reader and I don't give up on books easily. And I usually love books about horses. But this one, well...It doesn't have much of a plot. I guess it's ""the life of a cowhorse"", but Black Beauty was way more interesting than this was. There's little conversation-at least in Black Beauty the horses talked to each other. I really didn't find it at all engaging.The grammar is awful. Sure, I don't mind that in conversation. Or in a book written in the first person. It gives it a certain tone. But here it just seems like, well, like bad grammar! And it keeps changing tense! It'll say something like ""`I'll go over there,' he says, and then he got up and went to the barn.' Or ""He looks at the horse, and then he walked away.""I suppose writing standards were different back in the `20's; this book won the Newberry Medal. Still, I wouldn't recommend it."
1,Smokey the Good'll Cowhorse,"I hated this book, in fact I didn't even read the entire thing. I probably quit during page 80 or something. It significantly bored me because of its western words(which I couldn't understand)and its useless and excessive detail. And one more thing, I wouldn't give it any stars but I couldn't submit with out at least putting in one star. What can I say it was bad apple. You get those once in a while."
3,Smoky without pictures is not Smoky,The Aladdin edition of Smoky does not have Will James' famous pictures! That was very disappointing to say the least.
4,"Smokey, the cow horse- Will James","There was a movie made of this wonderful book! Currently not available but I wish it were. The Film is Titled ""Smoky"" (1946) with Fred MacMurray as Clint Barkley, Roy Roberts as Jeff, Anne Baxter as Julie Richards, Bruce Cabet as Frank Denton, and the charming Burl Ives comes out during campfires on the cattle drives to sing. I would love to see this movie again and hope that someday it will come out on DVD to join the other horse favorites."
3,A good book for young adults.,"I think that Smoky the Cowhorse is a great story that descriptively and vividly depicts the life a horse, Smoky, who through out the book touched the lives of many. Whether it was ranch workers or rodeo fans Smoky was one in a million. The book not only tells about the good stuff that happened to Smoky, but also some of the cruel things that were done to him."
1,Not a good book for kids,"This book won the Newberry medal in 1927. It appears that it is the 10th such winner I have read. But it is not a good book for kids to read since it uses for no discernible reason bad grammar continually. It never says ""knew"" but instead says ""knowed"". It also deliberately misspells words saying ""figgered"" for ""figured"", and the like. I found this very irritating and deplored that such a book would be thought to be a good book for kids trying to use literste English. It tells of a horse born in Montana who is eventually trained to be a horse used to handle cattle. The book is often boring and uninspiring. I kind of liked the ending--the only good part of the book"
2,Smoky: Animal cruelty too much for my tender hearted child,"I wish I had read the book first because my young daughter who is an advanced reader could not understand why someone could be cruel to Smokey. She loved the beginning with all the adventures but the second half took a bad turn for her tender heart. I wasn't ready to introduce her to the crueler side of life such as Animal cruelty and the title ""half-breed"". Unfortunately once an image is introduced it can't be erased. So parents should be aware this book is not appropriate for young horse loving children."
5,read Smoky The Cow Horse,"Have you ever read the book Smoky the cow Horse? Well if you haven't you need to!Especially if you love horses and you can't find a good book to read .This book never gets boring ,so you can't put it down . This book is about a horse named Smoky and his life from birth to death join him through all his experinces good or bad."
4,smokey the cow horse,I have read this book when i was 13. I found it very thrilling and unique. you can never find a book quite like it any whare. And if you liked black beauty you'll love smokey the cow horse. It is about a horse who was born on a cattle farm. It is from the horses point of view. Very few books are written about a horses point of view. so all horse lovers will be thrilled by this book.
4,Smoky the Cowhorse is a great book about the life of a horse,"I think that Smoky the Cowhorse is a great story that descriptively and vividly depicts the life a horse, Smoky, who through out the book touched the lives of many. Whether it was ranch workers or rodeo fans Smoky was one in a million. The book not only tells about the good stuff that happened to Smoky, but also some of the cruel things that were done to him."
3,Replacing a long lost friend,"Smoky the Cowhorse was among my favourite books. I was disappointed when my original copy was not returned after I loaned it to a friend. The replacement from Amazon certainly helped bring the story back to my shelf, but the book itself is of considerably lower quality than the one I lost."
3,A great tale for those who love horse stories,"A story of a great horse. Smoky is taught to be an excellent cowhorse, but even in his training, the cowboy teaching him sees the unusual abilities of this horse. Smoky spends many years as a cowhorse with Clint and the other cowboys, but one year, he is stolen by a renegade. The renegade treats Smoky harshly and turns Smoky into a bucking bronco, the fiercest horse in the West. Smoky spends many years establishing a reputation as a killer bronco, but gradually he grows old and tired and is sent to serve as a horse providing pony rides for children and old people. Somehow Clint finds Smoky again and the story ends happily ever after.The most fun part of the story is the way the whole book is written in cowboy dialect. Warning: The parts with the renegade have lots of racial slurs and can be difficult for a modern reader to get through."
5,The best cowboy book ever!,My dad bought me this book in 1954. It continues to be one of my favorites. Will James was the original cowboy author-illustrator and excellent at both. I can feel Smoky's hide under my hand and taste the dust of the great open spaces. A truly great read...and not just for the younger set!
2,"For a moderate priced red dot, not that good","I purchased this scope and was willing to pay a little more, because I had in the past had owned some Bushnell scopes. I was disappointed with the dot, it was blurry. If buying a red dot that isn't really a dot is ok with you, then buy it. I went with a Tru Glo TG8030TNB instead. That doesn't mean I sponsor the Truglo red dots over Bushnell, only that usually their dot on TG is more an oval."
3,"Okay, but not nearly as good as reviews","I bought this based off the positive reviews, but I had to ship the first one back because the reticules selector knob wouldn't turn. The second one was better, but still sticks when you get to the last setting. The reticules also have like a ghost shadow to them. Not very crisp at all at any intensity settings. They even look like smudges on the ""inside"" of the scope. I could have just gotten a bad batch, but I can't completely recommend or not recommend it."
1,"good waste of money, time and ammo","Bought this to go on my Mossberg 535 slug shotgun. It mounted fairly easy but that was the only plus. The reticles flickered bright to low no matter what setting it was on making it difficult to aim. Took the battery out it came with and it tested low so put in a new battery and still did the same thing. Would not hold any adjustments when sighting in. This was definately I got what I paid for, this is my only experience with red dot sights and probably my last."
4,OK,"the first one I received was broken, but I received a replacement right away. Very pleased with it so far."
5,BUSHNELL TROPHY RED/GREEN DOT SCOPE,Received the scope and rings quickly.Mounted perfectly on my Browning Buckmark .22 cal.Sight is secure and accurate!!!Good product for the price.Can't go wrong with Bushnell quality.
1,Needs better quality control,"If you are one of the lucky ones you will get a great scope for the price, solid built with nice features. In my case the image was doubled on all the setting and it didn't matter what intensity the light was set at. Really no excuse for this. Thankfully Amazon had no issues with me returning it and picked up the Aim Sports Red Dot Sight with 4 different reticles from here. It only has one color but the image is sharp and it was a third the price. So plus to Amazon for their competitive prices and fast shipping and minus to Bushnell that needs to spend some time at the manufacturer."
2,Held zero for 60 rounds,"I tried this out on my 44 super blackhawk, after about 60 rounds it lost zero. Not a bad scope I think it would work better for a smaller caliber or rifle."
1,Very poor quality control,"The red reticles are all perfect, the green reticles all show a pronounced ghost image about 2 MOA to the left, rendering the green reticles useless."
2,Ages 4-8? More like age 48.,"The title and intent looked fun and creative, but what a dreary exercise in feminist consciousness raising is inside. Do the authors have any sense of what draws a child's eye or child's ear? Where is our wiccan Dr. Scarry? Our feminist Dr. Seuss?? Certainly not here.Instead we get unappealing, small, non-coloring-friendly illustrations with such catchy child-appealing jingles like ""'high heels and handbags cloning project' got you down?"" (huh??) Not catchy enough? Try ""Underneath all the fancy clothing, Sophia found an enthusiastic love her own body."" Or that 4-year-old-crowd-pleaser, ""when she stopped chasing the dangling carrot of conventional femininity she was finally able to savor being a woman.""Now there isn't anything wrong with the intent here, but I challenge anyone to give me one example of a child that had FUN with this book.The plus side: the book is slightly more appealing than Girls Will Be Boys will be Girls...Pink boys and tough girls deserve better!!"
3,A pretty good foreign film,"The only problem I had with the film is while what the characters are goig through is intensely trmatic, I didn't feel connnected to the characters. Things happen and it is very sad, but ultimately a good ending. For me, I really wanted to see a Jewish movie, and this seemed like a good choice. Happy that I bought it for sure, but not the best movie out there."
4,* A prime example of the renaissance in Israeli film *,"While Israeli theatre has greatly deteriorated in quality over the last 20 years, Israeli film has blossomed, led by Israeli filmmakers influenced by the success of independent film in the US. Rather than copying Hollywood, these filmmakers aim to create Sundance type films with a clear Israeli sensibility. This is a wonderful slice-of-life film and an interesting look at the life of the working poor in Israel."
5,Yarbro writes great historical fiction!!!,"Let this be a note to Tor: I read everything I can get my hands on by Chelsea Quinn Yarbro, in particular the Saint Germain novels. However, I usually end up borrowing them from the library and buying them used or remaindered because I can't afford a series of $15 trade paperbacks. Please, please print these in mass media paper!I read the Saint Germain novels because I love his loooong view of history, not because it's horror. If you like to read historical fiction, you will be thrilled to find any of these books!"
4,Recommended,"Sound through the speakerphone varies based on how loud an automated attendant is. At first, I thought this was due to poor quality in the phone. The microphone hears really well. I like the handset for the AT&T; 210 Trimline better, but this is a good phone.5/16/11 Picked it up today, has a dial-tone in both handset and speakerphone, but won't dial out (touch tone or pulse). Only lasted 4.4 years. Disappointed."
3,"good by itself, but poor with accessories","I love that this has speakerphone but doesn't require batteries or a seperate power cord to plug into the wall. Unfortunately, due to the way the hard plastic is shaped around the receiver, it won't accommodate any of those cord untanglers: not this one:GE Cord Untangler (TL26135)and certainly not this one:TwisStops Telephone Cord Untangler, Clear SOF1500. With the former, I had to use an exacto knife to cut away some of the plastic in order to get the cord detangler to spin properly. Another frustrating thing about this phone is that the indentations the receiver sits in are SO shallow and so small, if you try to attach a hands-free shoulder rest device (the big old fashioned clip-ones, not the foam-rubber ones) it'll tip over from the extra weight! All in all, a decent phone I guess, but the product engineers were asleep at the wheel when considering the after-market modifications consumers could potentially use on the phone. Try harder next time AT&T;!"
5,Does what we need and does it well.,In our part of Southern California the power is unreliable and goes out often. We have a back-up generator for the times the power is out for hours (or occasionally days). When the power first goes out we need to call the electric company and of course our cordless phones do not work. That's why we have this phone. It does the trick. My wife calls the power company while I get the portable generator started.
4,If your a skier.....,then you will enjoy the ski scenes and the music soundtrack. Definitely a movie for skiers.
5,Perfect,"The card holder, pen holder, and ten slots are great! I find that the mesh pocket really isn't a good place to put change, as it's hard to get out. But I like the look, and am sure I'll find something to place there. If you're looking for a sleek visor organizer, this is it. Sturdy, protects the cds. I thought it wouldnt fit on my smaller visor, but it fits great!"
4,Intrigue in Kenya,"Ralph Fiennes plays a British diplomat who meets a fiery activist named Tessa. When he is assigned to a post in Kenya, she begs to come along as his wife or mistress. He marries her, and is completely devoted to her, but there are indications that she is unfaithful to him. She leads a double life in other ways and becomes involved in a group which opposes irresponsible dispensing of drugs by large pharmaceutical companies. When she dies, there are many unanswered questions which Fiennes spends the rest of the movie trying to answer. This is a beautifully-filmed and well-acted movie. At times the flashbacks are confusingly juxtaposed with the current action, but generally is makes for interesting and engrossing viewing."
3,Pretty Good,"I finally got a chance to see this Movie last week after hearing some buzz about it.I thought it was interesting,but kinda all over the place in some places.the Political tone of the film was interesting from time to time.the film held my attention for the most part.alot of drama with twists&turns."
2,The Constant Gardener,"I'm starting to appreciate John LeCarre novels more than I did when he was all over the bestseller list. This film version of one was acted well, but in 30 minutes there just wasn't anything to engage my interest. Not its characters and not its plot. A good cause worth building a story around, but not this story. I quit watching, so I guess I could be wrong, but I doubt it."
2,Wasted opportunity,"This could have been such a good movie. Despite its clichéd plot (big business bad) the settings and character development could have been great. Instead the director decided to just run with the clichés and ignore the rest. The cinematography was trying too hard to seem artistic using jerky, erratic motion and subdued hues. It could have been very beautiful but was just distracting.The plot was very clichéd and simplistic. It totally ignored the other factors in the region like corrupt governments (well, not totally but enough to seem so) and makes the African people seem like victims who need help from the ""white man"" instead of the strong people that they are.Overall this movie was a just a huge disappointment to me."
1,Big disappointment,"Almost unwatchable. The camera never stops moving, and by that I don't mean panning. I mean jerking, twitching, and swaying. At best the movie would have been only passable if it HAD been watchable. Here's a tip if you must see it - take some seasick medicine first. The friend I was with, unbothered by the filming, gave it two stars for the thin plot and clichés."
2,I blame the editor,"The Constant Gardener's story is a polemic that could have been told in 1/2 hour .The theme is: 'Multinational drug companies are run by unscrupulous bastards who will stop at nothing, whether it be falsifying the results of clinical drug trials in Africa, to killing anyone who gets in their way. Drug companies have the same morals as arms manufacturers and most Western governments.""Gee .... never would have worked that out for myself !!!!!Ralph Fiennes is rather easy on the eyes, however, so I will give the film 2 stars, rather than none. The editor should have been the person shot in the last scene, not Ralph !"
4,"IT'S ONLY ME, BUT:",A THRILLER INVOLVING MURDER. THE WIFE IS BRUTALLY MURDERED AFTER INVESTIGATING THE DOINGS OF A DIRTY PHARACEUTICAL COMPANY. HER HUSBAND PICKS UP THE INVESTIGATION OF THE DIRTY DRUG COMPANY AFTER HER DEATH TO FIND OUT WHY SHE DIED. JM
1,2+ hour movie that could've been done in 30- minutes without taking away from the plot,"The camera crew must have been drunk. Impossible to watch without getting queasy. Slow, slow moving plot and tons of worthless scenes (all the while moving the camera with what must have been a horrid hangover)- save yourself 2 hours and just read a one sentence review.Sucks, sucks, SUCKS BADLY."
4,"Africa, Big Business & Colonalism","The Constant Gardener is a film that explores many themes; marriage, faith, love, greed, poverty, and cultural differences. The cinematography of Africa and all of its beauty and humanity are emotionally captured. The plot involving British intellegence, corporate pharmaceutical capitalism, and African societal explotation are melded together. This aspect of the film is confusing. It is often difficult to identify which characters are agents, spys, doctors, dignitaries, politicians, and murderers. What is beautifully crafted is the relationship that exists between Dr. Quale ( Ralph Fiennes) and his activist wife Tessa ( Rachael Weisz). After Tessa's death Dr. Quale comes to the realization that his doubts and suspicions concerning his wife were unfounded. In reality he learns more about his wife's inner soul after he researches the causes of her death. The ending of the movie was moving."
5,"Powerful, haunting, thrilling, and....SAD!","The Constant Gardener is an amazing film. I've not read the novel upon which it was based. This film falls into that category of film that haunts you during and after. You never really know where the story is headed, and the screenplay manipulates the viewer into changing your mind about key characters, their fidelity, and their motivations. The locations in Africa, with the shantytowns, the open sewers, the long lines, the privilege station of (some) aid workers is so realistic.This is a great film. Don't plan on going dancing right afterward... your mind, and your muscles, will not feel joyous."
3,A smart thriller that will have us hooked but will leave us confussed at times,This surprisingly good drama/thriller will have viewer hooked from begging to end. The story about a women that's murderd and her husband trying to find out why and on the way uncovers a conspercicy that will change the world. The story is very smart and intreging but you have to pay close attention or you'll be lost. The movie is confussing at times becouse the story is complex and if you miss one thing you'll be lost. The acting is the greatest thing about the film. Overall it's entertaining and it's a good film.
4,"""The Girl in the Cafe"" meets ""The Fugitive""...","... with a few of the same fine actors.And any two would make a nice double feature. 'Gardener' and 'Fugitive' share the BigPharmaCorp conspiracy theme, while 'Cafe' and 'Gardener' fold in abject world poverty. The first two are actioners, while ""The Girl in the Cafe"" is quiet but powerful, and my favorite of the three."
2,I liked it but...,"The constant gardener was a ""good"" movie... not a ""great"" movie. It was a bit long and dry... had a couple of decent internal twists that you don't see coming right away. But in the final analysis a bit of a yawner for me.I like to buy my movies, I don't go see them in the theatre because I can own them for about the same money and enjoy them at home any time I wish. In this case... I wish I hadn't bought it.p.s. If any of the actors read this, please don't take it personal I loved the entire cast and the acting was splendid!"
3,next time meirelles will take us inside the slums of antarctica,"yet another movie whose impact is undercut by a director who doesnt know how to pare down his material. the same problems that affected his ""city of god"" are prevalent here, but there are strong performances and good intent so i give it a qualified positive."
1,Don't waste your money!,This will be a lot of fun for paranoids who never met a conspiracy they didn't absolutely love.
2,"Saturated video, unsaturated pace","Meirelles is up to his old CITY OF GOD tricks, using deeply saturated colors (probably shot on hi-def video) and quick editing... but the tricks here do not do justice to the story nearly as much as they did with GOD. Rio is helter skelter. Africa is relatively barren.The next to last scene at the refugee camp (fifteen minutes or so) could easily have been deleted for a much more effective pace leading to the final resolution. Reminds me of Bono preachifying in the middle of songs on U2's current tour. Just play the darn music Mr. Bono Man!The movie dies here before the protagonist does."
2,"Disappointed, but still a Fiennes fan!!","I LOVE Ralph Fiennes & I loved the English Patient, but I was very disappointed by this movie in the theater. He's wonderful, but too long, too depressing, and it seemed like there was no real chemistry (the're in love, but you don't really understand why or how). I'll continue to watch all of his films, but if considering buying.......pass!"
1,boring,"I could not watch the whole movie as I found it boring and not credible in parts (when Tessa erupts in an outburst at a lecture). Fiennes' character's reaction was not believable as Tessa came across as a petulant brainwashed student spouting all the rhetoric one is so used to hearing (and with le carre's predictable bias - USA bad UK bad WAR bad, blah blah...) I found Tessa's character cloying and could not identify enough with anyone in this film to make it thru the end. Glad I borrowed it from the library and didn't waste my $ on it."
2,"Monumental issues, but fails to convince","I have been a Le Carre fan until the end of the Cold War. I somehow still managed to follow him later for some time. But now it is over, definitely. I disliked this novel, and the movie is obnoxious. Rachel Weisz is quite ridiculous in her part. Which idiot nominated her for her Oscar is beyond the point. Zellweger got an Oscar for an even more horrible performance recently, in the otherwise quite acceptable Cold Mountain. And even the otherwise great Blanchett had to turn in an awful performance in The Aviator to get one. (Why can these nice girls not get one for one of their good movies?)My conclusion: this world is strange. It has no idea what is good and what not."
3,Spoiler ending,"Movie was good, but a bit slow. The ending was a bit illogical though. The Justin Quayle(Ralph Fiennes)character did not have to die at the end.He sacrifices himself for nothing...just to ""understand"" his wife? Watch and see what you think."
4,Message Much?,"I liked this movie. I love Ralph Fiennes as an actor. He's utterly brilliant, so restrained and intense - enough to give a girl shivers every time. But.But this movie is so heavy-handed it was painful. It bleeds for Africa, from the European man's point of view. It's brilliant of course, but it sees things so definitely through the lens of middle class guilt that it's hard to cope with if you've ever actually been poor.It's about pharmecutical companies doing illegal things with a TB cure in a third world country, the death of a woman and the lengths her husband goes to when he finds out he hardly knew this woman he loved and married.And it's so overwrought, so fast-paced when it should have been slow and meditative.I'm a little disapointed in it. But I did like it."
3,The Constant Gardener,I must be slow it took me a while to understand the flashbacksI loved story line and plot but lost the continuity in the flashbacks. A second viewing knowing how often it flashed back helped.At first I thought there were too many people who looked alike.
2,Meh.,"It was a well made movie, I'll give it that. But I just wasn't very engaged by it. If one really wants to protect someone, not just make a premise for a movie, I think it is typically a better idea to keep them well-informed than to keep them bumbling in the dark. The ethics of drug research is an interesting topic to me, but it was somehow dulled by the drama."
4,I loved it.,Fernando Meirelles's take on the John Le Carre novel is a study of corruption and a study of true love all at once. Rachel Weisz and Ralph Fiennes give solid and powerful performances with great written characters that are human in a realistic way that does not insult the audience. Weisz is superb and captivating as a human rights worker who is willing to do almost anything to protect the people around her and Fiennes is tender and strong will as a man who must find the courage in himself to right a wrong and fight a huge injustice. Fernando Meirelles serves all of them well with a visual look a place that is really not seen too much in films and the landscape of Africa has never looked better anywhere in another film.This is a great movie and I was crying towards the end. That's how great it really was.
5,An Intelligent Thriller,"While I am not a big fan of LeCarre's novels, this movie is intelligent and moving as it relates the love story between a socially concious Tessa and her husband. At first he feels Tessa has betrayed him but eventually discovers the truth behind her excursions into the African countryside. More a love story than a political thriller (although it has that sidetoo). Great acting and Racel Weisz's performance is Oscar worthy and you will see why she won."
1,Too slow -- a mind-numbing 2+ hours,"While Ralph Finnes and Rachel Weisz are excellent actors, this film left me wondering how they managed to stay awake long enough to film their scenes. The plot of the movie was excellent, but that's about the end of it. The evil government and corporate operatives were so obvious as to be laughable. There was really no mystery here at all and the outcomes were predictable.My main beef was the glacial pace of the movie and the frentic camera work that made me want to put my popcorn down and grab some dramamine. At times, I found my eyes fluttering shut, as it was easier to just listen to the dialog rather than watch it.The main attraction of the movie was Africa itself and the occasional pauses in the film that let the beauty of the land and people shine through.If you must see it, be sure to load up on some coffee beforehand. Trust me, you'll need it."
3,Gripping storyline,Very realistic action and interesting story but dragged in places and certain crucial information omitted. I feel some great scenes were left on cutting room floor.
2,Predictable. Tired. Worn. Ragged.,"Constant Gardner is a suspense movie of international intrigue. Unfortunately, it is altogether predictable and weary.Imagine a big bad multinational pharmaceutical company conducting unethical experiments on poor tribal natives of Africa with a wink and nod from the British government. Add a diplomat with integrity and a young activist woman with a cause and you have the essence of the film.Pharmaceutical companies are easy targets and African natives are easy prey. The plot is simply too weary and threadbare to rouse either interest or excitement."
2,The Gardener Is a Preacher?,"I love movies. I don't enjoy being preached to. From the anti-Iraq War tirade in one of the early scenes, to the actual plot, this ""Capitalism: Bad,"" ""NGO: Good"" message they tried to force feed me was not enjoyable. If I wanted that, I'd pop in a Michael Moore ""documentary."""
1,I GIVE IT ONE STAR ONLY BECAUSE RALPH FIENNES IS IN IT,"This movie has been terribly hyped-up, for reasons unbeknownst to me, perhaps politically, I presume, in the usual Hollywood fashion. It has got to be one of the most slow-moving, boring, uninteresting movies I have had the pain of having to waste my time on ~ while attempting to sit through it. However, the one and only good thing about it is that Ralph Fiennes is in it ~ but that is all. Don't waste your money and time on this dud, as I'm sorry I did."
1,It's quite hard to bring LeCarre books to film . . .,". . . And this Constant Gardner movie is no exception. Except they did capture the boring, drumming meter of the book. The book, which I snoozed through, garnered justifiably lame reviews; I expect the movie, eventually, after the hype, will too. I'm irked at myself that I didn't wait for the initial PR barrage to subside."
1,Are you kidding me?,"Focusing on the evils of the British government and the pharmaceutical industry? This would be a silly cliché in any setting. But to trying to sell it with the backdrop of modern day Africa, with it's rampant disease, poverty, corruption, dictatorial tyranny and genocidal violence it too much to stomach. Worthless and counter productive!"
2,Everybody is a Noble Victim,"Everything about this movie was about being a victim. The evil corporations, the impotent and diseased Colonial government, the crusader who (of course) was murdered for standing-up for her beliefs. Ugh, should be the ""poster-boy"" movie for the liberal left. Very predictable ending as well.Sound track and scenery of Africa was well done, hence the 2 star rating"
2,racial and big business politics collide,"Another movie about the great white hope coming to the aide of Africa's expandable and ignorant population. (sarcasm) Other than great cinmatography (it's very pretty) this movie has very little going for it. I, too, didn't believe the 'love' story and I'm ify ify on whether Weisz prformance was worthy of an Oscar. Everyone just confessed to what was going on...so I fail to see how any of it was a secret with so many loose lips involved. I'm sorry this hardly qualifies as a thriller...at no point was I glued to the edge of seat. Seems to me if the woman had just established a blog-we wouldn't have had much of a film. Bottomline: A pretty boring film."
2,Can't explain why,"But even thought I fully expected to enjoy this movie (I've enjoyed Ralph's work in the past), I couldn't bring myself to do so. Sorry Ralph!"
1,i thought it was gonna be about a guy who gardens constantly...,"This movie starts off with a woman and a man kissing each other goodbye, then the woman goes on a plane. Then it flashbacks to when they first met; at his lecture. His name is Justin and her name is Tessa. Tessa gets pregnant and after 9 months loses the baby. I'm not sure what Tessa's profession was, nor am i interested, but i think she liked going to other countries to help out certain people.Very slow moving and boring. It kept going back and forth from flashback to present, most of the time i wouldn't know what was going on."
1,Into the garbage can !,"Similar to the Interpreter. We are bad UN is good; and this is only after the first ten minutes into the movie.I think that John LeCarre figured out that the only way to get one of his novels made into a movie is to write a leftist formulaic type novel. I wonder, if the novel was about the corruption of the African goverments and the United Nations.....? would a movie be made on that theme..........hm !Probably ............. NOT !I bought this movie without reading the novel based on how much I enjoyed Smiley's People and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. What a disappointment.It used to be that anti capitalist and anti American agendas were subtlety placed in movies, now is all out there for our consumption and enjoyment.And people wonder why movie attendance is going down."
1,If I could give this negative stars I would....,"Wow- this movie is up there with spice world. My inlaws rented it because of the reviews on the DVD case saying it was ""thrilling"" and a shocking ending. This movie was predictable liberal garbage, Not only was it the slowest developing movie I've ever seen but you can predict the ending from the first twenty minutes... As soon as ""Tessa"" asks ""Arnold"" why the drug companies are giving HIV poitive people meds for TB You know that some how this is going to be a giant conspiracy about how EVVVVILLL drug companies are. This movie was the biggest waste of two hours of my entire life. The whole family agreed it sucked."
1,Really boring,Maybe it gets better after the first half hour. I don't know. That's all I could stand.
2,It was the pharmacist who did it!,"It is not clear how you are supposed to take this movie . . . is it just a story of the pathetic little diplomat and his hysteric wife or is something bigger intended?Perhaps I got this wrong, but I was left wondering whether the director and writers actually believe that Africa's problems are due to nasty capitalists, not the fading legacies of colonialism, the tribalism that holds back modernization, the promiscuity that produces AIDS, the perpetual wars that plague the continent and the fact that so many African leaders have been homicidal maniacs.This is a silly, tedious movie with a silly premise and it is sad to see something like this coming from the pen of the man who wrote the Smiley novels."
1,"Trash, Profanity, Adultery, Fornication!!!!!!!","Morally disgusting! I bought it $5 because I enjoy movies filmed in Africa and Europe. Profanity, Adultery, Fornication, Idolatry and everything immoral.... Not a family movie. The cursing and swearing starts early. The nudity and love scenes are too much. Why do they have to go to this extent to sell movies... I threw it in the trash!"
5,Heart-Wrenching Thriller,"I don't think ""The Constant Gardener"" is what one would call a conventional thriller. The culprits are pretty transparent early on but what I think concerns the makers of the film is not whodunit but rather how to shed light on their malfeasence. In the meantime the film offers a lot of food for thought about how the Third World is exploited by the major pharmaceutical companies and their corporate and government accomplices. I think the film also concerns itself with passive diplomat Justin Quayle(Ralph Fiennes) bringing closure to the horrific murder of his activist wife, Tessa(Rachel Weisz). Fiennes is nothing short of brilliant in an understated performance that suggests the anger and frustration that lurks within. Weisz deservedly won an Oscar in an impassioned and effervescent turn so much so that Justin's loss is the audience's loss as well. A truly great film not to be missed."
3,The Constant Gardener DVD,"What The Constant Gardener is about pharmaceuticals, AIDS, tuberculosis, and Africa. I feel that The Constant Gardener is a movie about the cover up of the pharmaceutical industry as it relates to the diseases of tuberculosis and AIDS in Africa. The critics have said that this is also a love story. However, I feel that it is more a story of lies and betrayal. I don't see how it can be a love story. When the wife is lying to her husband about what she's doing, or perhaps just neglecting to tell him what she's doing.The first hour of the movie is very slow with a lot of exposition. The second hour of the movie is better. Once we get into the meat of the story. That is why I am only giving this movie three starts. I felt that this movie could have been better, if only they would have paid more attention to the editing process."
1,Incredibly Boring & Unoriginal,"I love Ralph Fiennes but this film is truly bad. That pharmaceutical companies test and dump obsolete technologies onto the Third World is old news. But when Ralph's wife starts asking questions, it gets her murdered! Please. As if any multi-billion dollar industry would be so concerned about the rantings of a pregnant ding-bat.The real problem, is that you don't care about the wife who is found murdered. She is an unlikeable character; I couldn't wait for her to exit the movie. She is obnoxious, secretive, and you just don't fully trust her. What ruined it for me, is that Ralph Fienne's character gives up his life to find a wife who was a virtual stranger to him; he didn't even know her. Their relationship was barely established, there was no sense that theyhad any kind of emotional connection. Enough said. Boring, boring, boring. And finally, I'm so sick of the SHAKY CAMERA in films these days. It makes you sea-sick."
1,Boring...,"Yep. Pharma companies are evil. Got it. Good acting, but I looked at the timer on the DVD player about 1:07 into the movie and was ready for this to be over. I thought it had been on for 2 hours. Boring. Big business is out to get me again!!! Fortunately for big business, I don't buy this load of junk."
1,Boring!,What mystery? What excitement? About 45 minutes into it I got up to use the restroom and told my companion who was watching it with me not to bother to pause it. When I got back she had shut it off. She said she was bored with it also.
2,A well acted snooze fest with juvenile politics,"This is billed as a thriller but there are hardly any thrills. It would have benefitted from some judicious cutting to make it a little leaner. The shaky camera work detracts from some decent scenery.The politics of the film contain no subtlety or shades of gray; I can almost see a couple of college sophomores hitting the bong and sitting down to hash out the script:Bong-hitting liberal student who has no clue about the real world #1: ...and then she discovers the evil corporation has been testing...BHLSWHNCATRW #2: (Interrupts) ""Evil Corporation""? Why are you being redundant?The only plus for my wife and I was the acting, which was great. Fiennes was especially good, underplaying his character in the early parts of the film, resulting in a character with depth and nuance. I only wish the rest of the film was worthy of the performances contained within it."
2,The Constant Gardener,"Rachel Weisz won an oscar for 'Best Actress' for her portrayal of a dedicated humanitarian in this movie. That is the only reason I've rated it - 2 Stars.It is typically 'English' in its context, both in its characters and its oddly morbid plot, which never quiet unfolds until its final, disturbing climatic finish.It's one of those movies that leave me with a 'why in the h*** did I waste my time watching this piece of garbage' feeling.If you're one of those viewers who cling to every lauding critique by those esteemed film critics, you will probably enjoy this film, not because its a good story, but because 'they' gave it a 'critically acclaimed' review.I'd rather watch 'Rocky' again."
1,A Constant Cliche,"A leftist activist fights the good fight against evil big business on behalf of poverty stricken AIDS patients. Gee, this is really original Hollywood fare, isn't it? Her alliance with a gay African doctor rounds out the politcally-corrrect cast of characters. I expected much more than the same old hackneyed left-wing tripe this cliched formula movie serves up."
1,"If You're prone to motion sickness, don't watch this film!","The hand held camera work is all over the place and before you know it, you realize that uneasy queasiness in the pit of your stomach isn't just from the acting. The anti-Bush, anti_America tirade did little to further the movie nor did the unlikely and tired plot of the villainous pharmaceutical companies out to destroy all of man-kind for profit. Save your time and money on this one and try Hotel Rwanda for a really good movie!"
4,Well made Africa-has-issues flick,"Liked ""Blood Diamond""? This one concerns drug companies testing new drugs with fatal side effects, only life is cheap in Africa. So there's a coverup. Actually, the film is a love story. Very well made, quick paced, lots of jerky camera work trying to give the illusion of immediacy. You don't have to be a bleeding heart to appreciate the quality of this film."
5,WONDERFUL movie - watched it repeatedly,"Last week I sent this DVD to my cousin on his birthday and the whole family sent me a thank you letter for sending them such a wonderful gift. I found it on an Amazon associate site www.cuteseller.com and they claim to be Online shopping from the earth's biggest selection of books, magazines, music, DVDs, videos, electronics, computers, software, apparel & accessories, shoes, jewelry, tools & hardware, housewares, furniture, sporting goods, beauty & personal care, gourmet food & just about anything else. <a href=""http://www.cuteseller.com/shop/"">Cuteseller Shopping Online</a>"
1,Leaves much to be desired.......,"Producers please take note: wildly moving cinematography can be used to show movement or a first person perspective, but when used throughout the entire movie in nearly every scene, it merely comes across as amateurish. Honestly, the cinematography in this film is something I would expect from a group of high-school kids putting together their first film for a class. The fact that somebody actually thought this would be a good idea for a major motion picture is beyond comprehension to me. Watch this movie and try NOT to get a headache. I turned it off before it was over, though I did sit (suffer) through 90% of it. It must also be averred that this is an easy movie to turn off....the story is simply not a compelling one at all."
2,Overrated and kind of boring,"I thought this movie was kind of blah, the characters were not interesting, it kept reverting to previous scenes (in his mind), and nothing really happened. The overall plot and subplot was good, but it didn't make much use of it. The wife fell asleep right away in this one."
2,A good thriller but absurd and misleading,"This movie was beautifully filmed and well acted, a good thriller and a treat for Fiennes fans. BUT what a ridiculous plot. Are people so overwhelmed by the relentlessly negative media coverage of pharmaceutical prices that it has become plausible that a pharmaceutical company functions like a cross between the KGB and the Mafia? Even as I was touched by the romance of it, I choked on the silly plot developments."
3,The Constant Gardener,"I thought this was a perfectly-cast and wonderfully-acted film(particularly by Rachel Weisz) but there were too many elisionsfrom the novel to make the plot entirely coherent. I also foundthe depiction of Africa rather too unrealistically hygienic andthe penultimate scene at Quayle's memorial service was a disappointment, straining credulity to the utmost. However. thetheme of corruption in high places is, unfortunately, only tootopical and the film is successful in engaging one's sympathiesand holding one's attention. Not a patch on ""City of God"", though"
3,CountryInterviewsOnline.net,"By: Tracy StefansWith a broad mixture of Texas artists Brewed in Texas Vol. 2 has 20 drinking songs put out in a new compilation CD. The album features the Randy Rogers Band, Charlie Robison, Rick Trevino, Ray Wylie Hubbard, Honeybrowne, and many more talented artists.""She's Actin' Single (I'm Drinkin' Doubles)"" is the first song on the CD by the Randy Rogers band. Charlie Robison is back and adds his talents to the CD with ""Barlight"". It is great to hear Rick Trevino on this compilation; his vocals are so unique.The CD contains many other very talented performers and is rounded out with MuzikMafia member Chance. Chance definitely has the most obscure sounding track when he raps and sings his unreleased song, ""I Came to Drink.""[...]"
1,MISSED OUT ON THIS ONE,This CD would not play in my computer. So I can't rate this one. The preview was very interesting. Enough for me to order it.
1,"""Tibetan master"" is a channeled spirit!","Alice Bailey was a disciple of Madame Blavatsky, and this supposed ""Tibetan Master"" is some kind of spirit guide that appeared to her or was channeled. She did not travel to Tibet to sit at his feet, as I had imagined. If you are looking for real Tibetan teachings, this is not it; this is occult writing."
5,"A classic history of modern Cambodia, updated and revised.","Worth the price just for the detailed account of the conduct and aftermath of the less than totally successful $2 billion United Nations effort to bring peace and democracy to Cambodia. Becker's account of the December 1978 killing of Malcolm Caldwell is riveting. Her incorporation of the personal stories of victims of the Pol Pot regime's Tuol Sleng extermination center helps readers better understand the atmosphere of those terrible days. Readers wanting further detail on Tuol Sleng should read David Chandler's ""Voices from S-21"" and Vann Nath's ""Cambodian Prison Portrait""."
3,"Enlightening, but a little dry","If you're looking for a book detailing the personal experiences of survivors of the killing fields, this book is not for you. ""When the War Was Over"" focuses more on the politics within Cambodia and the countries which affect it. Entire chapters are devoted to the political climate in Vietnam, the United States, China, the Soviet Union and Thailand. Elizabeth Becker analyzes them in excruciating detail, but I did come away with a deeper understanding for how the problems in Cambodia developed and the aftermath of the wars.This book does require quite a bit of concentration. At times, I would lose track of who a certain politician was or what was his role. I felt like I was reading a textbook. It would make a good reading assignment. Very analytical, a little dry, maybe needed a more human element. The personal stories were short and quickly buried beneath the behemoth mound of politics. Overall, an enlightening experience, but I had to push myself through it."
3,Correction to Joseph Pacelli's Review,"1) The Khmer Rouge didn't win the war after the Vietnamese's invasion. The Khmer Rough won the war in 1975, against the Lonol's regime. The Vietnamese's invasion is in 1979; this invasion pushed the Khmer Rough into the jungle bordered with Thailand.2) As far as I know, the Khmer Rough didn't commit the atrocities until the it won the war (1975). These atrocities lasted until the Vietnamese invasion in 1979.3) I read the first edition of this book years ago. I remembered that it was a decent book."
4,Khmer's and the Red Khmers,"After my travels to Cambodia, visiting the Killing fields and what not, and speaking to the Khmers about the Khmer Rouge, I had this horrible vision of what the KR may have been like. After reading this brilliantly penned book, and given the chance to make a judgement from a text written from neither side, I have found the KR to have a spirit the Khmers in Phnom Phen would never speak of. It's just unfortunate that they were led by a man such as Pol Pot. A great read, with the perfect mix of personal experiences from the author, individual's stories, and political happenings, right until the last chapter, when things drag out and get a little too detailed. This IS the book to read on the Cambodian Revolution, not just because it seems to be the only one out there, but because it is a damn good book."
1,Tedious and poorly written,"I came here looking for a book that might explain the background to what happened in Cambodia. But i can only conclude Becker covered this turmoil from the her apartment's balcony. This has to be one of the most lifeless products of a typewriter keyboard that I have ever read. Maybe that's too harsh, but I know I didn't find the answer to anything I was looking for. Who did she write this for, herself?"
5,Fascinating old-school gothic folk,"Based upon home recordings made by basement auteur Warren Defever from 1985-1989, remixed for wide release in 1990 by 4AD head honcho Ivo Watts-Russell and his This Mortal Coil cohort, John Fryer, ""Livonia"" is a fascinating slab of old-school gothic folk.The prevalent themes throughout are death, reincarnation, ghosts and transcending the everyday world. It can all be a little forboding, but the music is so cleverly constructed and the album flows so nicely, it never bogs you down. In fact, you'll probably want to put the CD player on repeat and just listen to it over and over.Heavily influenced by the classic ""4AD sound,"" ""Livonia"" is full of dark melodies, gentle female vocals, sound collages, and the occasional near-heavy-metal guitar outburst. Granted, this style of music is not for everyone. But if goth, 4AD or eerie folk is your thing, you either already own this album, or must buy it now."
4,If you love traditional polyphony ...,"... this CD sounds at some points like Bulgarian, or Albanian, but it isn't. Very nice field recordings, some extremely marvelous melodies (like no. 5 and 6). Like the breeze of a late spring night ...."
4,Gardner's Best Written Work,"If you don't know of Gerald Gardner, he was one of Aleister Crowley's last henchmen and the founder of the religion of Wicca as we know it today. He was also a big feature in Patricia Crowther's autobiography. This I believe to be, while not his best and definately a cash in or cash grab on his fame or notoriety, is his best written book. Especially, it doesn't seem like a cheaply made reprint of a key figure in the modern Wiccan movement. This reissue seems more professional, like a clinical disertation on the history and cult movement of witchcraft. Other reissues of these classic text seemed cheaply made. This is devoid of many typos as seen in his fiction and not as tacky looking as his Witchcraft Today. Even though currently I am pursuing a renewed interest in more conventional Christian ethics, this is worth looking into as an alternative religion and lifestyle."
3,Intro to Ig and Met Petro,"It is a well written book, but there are no color pictures. If I spend that amount of money on a hardcover textbook, I expect some color photos, especially since mineralogy and petrology deal with birefringence colors and such."
3,A little boring.,The children really did not care for The Little Drummer Boy. I feel the story could have been told better. They did like the Santa Claus Coming to Town. It was not to bad they sit a little longer for the movie.
5,Excellent compilation of Brit pop,"I first bought this CD at the end of my summer trip to England because it reminded me of the music I listened to during my nights out in England. I could almost fell the pain of the penalty kick that tossed England out of the World Cup while listening to Three Lions '98. Although all of the tracks are ""pop"" it is still a great mix and I highly recommend it!"
4,Good concept book,"My daughter received this book as a gift when she was a year old. She is now almost 3 and still really enjoys reading this one. The great thing about this book is how it teaches your child to see counting and numbers in familiar objects, but does it differently than the other five million counting books out there. I'd recommend it!"
2,Would not recommend...,"I don't like these as much as other brands I've used.If anyone's going to order based on the former reviews where they received 20 lifters, no more. Now you only get two, or one pair. So you can get a pair of a better designed brand in a office products store for about $2.50 or almost 50% less than the price of these. Not a good buy."
4,Creative Web Cam Live Motion Camera is good,Good picture Tracking had to be turned off to much movement in the camera head but I am just sitting here at the keyboad and I am not walking around. A keeper
4,All but pan & tilt with Vista Ultimate,"It works great with XP & XP64 but pan & tilt is not supported for Vista Ultimate... Dragggggg, get with the program Creative Labs!....."
1,Doesn't work with AIM,"The camera works fine with Yahoo Instant Messenger, and with the software that Creative includes with the product. But we got the camera to use it with AIM which is what the rest of our distributed family uses. Alas, neither AIM 5.9 nor AIM Triton displays anything from the the camera. Creative's support has been frustrating. They have suggested a number of things to do if the camera doesn't work at all, ignoring the fact that I've told them where the camera does work, and that we get the same results on two very different computers.The problem may be with AIM, but then Creative's website and tech support should just say that, instead of encouraging users to think that it does work. I've found several entries on the web indicating others having the same problem."
2,Will not install,"I tried to install this on 3 different computers, A Toshiba, a Sony and a voodoo. It will not install on any of them."
2,Disappointed in video quality,"From the photos and specs I thought this was ""the camera"" to have (both my wife and I loved the look of the camera from the photos we had seen). There's always exceptions to rules, and the rule, ""the more you pay, the more you get"" is the exception to the rule for this web camera. After getting it, I had difficulty in getting the software to load but eventually had success. I was very disappointed in the video quality. There seemed to be a lot of noise in the picture, and tweaking gave no improvement. I returned it to Amazon and took a lose in the return shipping cost, but considered it worth it just to get the price of the camera back. Amazon lived up to their part and refunded the price paid (less return shipment) with no hassle."
2,Very Expensive and it is not worth to buy!!,"I am not satisfied with this Creative Webcam Live! Motion- Titanium. I bought this even of the higher cost because I thought it should be the best. However,the authomatic sensor is junk and the headphone is broken. The tracking device is not very good because each time I moved the captured picture would blur and freeze. The pant and tilt control is a pain. Although it works well with Yahoo messenger, as a buyer, you should consider spending time reading other reviews of a procuct that you are interested. Higher price does not mean good product."
4,Slagger's Bag,"In this inconsequential novella by Flann O'Brien, two orphans of the gormless, Finbarr and Manus, grow up next to their guardian Mr. Collopy's prodigious crock. They chafe under the old man and plot their escape. Manus dreams of cash, Finbarr of auburn hair. As part of their unconventional education, they listen with muffled groans to disputations between Collopy and regular visitor Father Fahrt on subjects theological and heretical. Guy Fawkes a hero for the ages? Aquinas a right chancer? Saints and sinners dangle from their hooks. Though dismissed by critics, this late work never fails to produce a chuckle. Its author certainly lends credence to Fahrt's contention that ""a degraded social climate is essential to inspire great men to achievement in the arts,"" even if that climate is some dark snug a Liffey's width from the Custom House."
3,Hard Times in Dublin - Quite Hard on the Reader As Well,"In the final years of his life O'Brien decided to go back to writing and this is one of the effects. A fairly slim novella on hard times, set in the turn of the century (19th and 20th) Dublin with two orphan brothers reaching maturity under the care of a busy (in his thoughts mainly) Dubliner. The book can be funny at times but generally it lacks a clear direction. Is it a veiled criticism of the Catholic Church? If so, it is so veiled the Church failed to notice as O'Brien allegedly hoped for a censorship ban on the book.If you fell for At Swim-Two-Birds and need more O'Brien you may try it but keep your hopes low. If this is your first O'Brien move to At Swim-Two-Birds or The Third Policeman as soon as you can and rest assured you will not regret it. Last but not least - if the combination of ""Ireland"", ""children"" and ""hard times"" makes you think of Angela's Ashes you can't be more wrong in this case."
3,Really Screwed,"This was a nasty cd, the voices sound monster-like thanks to the slow motion. 4 of the songs were o.k. but that's about it.Normal version is better"
2,sound,If you like the technohause. this can be your cd. but is you dont like the technohause. you will not love this album.. for me this is one of the wors work in remix..is much more better the Next two CDs. Paroles qui dansent. et L`anne 2000.
2,Not my cup of tea,"Music is very personal, so I am not stateing this album is not good. It's just not my cup of tea."
1,outdated and unobtainable products,"The three cleansers that are rated the best (Spiezia, Liz Earle, and Eve Lom) are impossible to find in the U.S. I tried web searches and a trip to a great organic products store without success. The Lancome foundation and blush that one of the authors uses herself is not available any more either. This book appears to have products in it which you could buy if you lived in England, and the Lancome products are discontinued."
2,Good if you live in the UK.,"The title and book summary were a little misleading after reading the book. I was looking forward to seeing what items were top rated and attempting to use them myself. However, many of the items of impossible to find in the US. Also, prices are never mentioned, and probably for good reason because everything they recommend is EXPENSIVE!! I was quite disappointed because I am a beauty book junkie and this is the first one I believe I am going to return."
3,"OK, but many errors","I liked the book. I wasn't really worried about the Tried and Tested because I wasn't looking for products I could use. However, the many grammar/spelling errors really irked me. The authors continuously forgot to put the second parenthese when using them.Also, like another user said, a few times, the pages just stopped midsentence, which was really confusing. I do like how they gave some tips and tricks. Thankfully, I only got this book from the library and didn't spend anything on it"
4,everything is funnier in chibi.,"If you are a fan of the Haruhi series in any of its forms - be it the movie, TV series, light novels, or the manga adaptation - this series will make a welcome addition to your collection and will keep you highly entertained. Based on a popular fan adaptation, this chibi (a cutesy manga art style) builds off the already ridiculous, over the top plots and humor of the original series and makes it more so. Eroge loving Nagato plays with a mini-fied Asakura, Kyon is even more sarcastic, Haruhi more insane, and, if it is even possible, Asahina Mikuru is even cuter.That being said, if you aren't familiar with the series, this may be funny, but something of the ""inside joke"" feeling of the show will be lost. But if you have seen the series or read the books, this really is a great supplement."
4,Wacky Characters and Authentic Local Scenes,"Papazoglou's strong suits are her descriptions of wacky characters and authentic local scenes. Among the idiosyncratic people we meet in this story are a fifty-five year old tattoed, coccaine-addicted ex-prostitute and a thirty year old virgin famous for writing the sexiest books in the romance field. There is also one very kleptomaniacal cat. The best New York descriptions include a special Greek restaurant and a trip through parts of 42nd Street and Ninth Avenue."
4,5 stars if it had bigger images,A great topic for a book and an interesting read. Some beautiful images are included although many of them are very small which was disappointing. Though a few images are presented as double page spreads which was wonderful. Recommended if you want to try Trompe L'oeil painting yourself and want some ideas of what has been done previously.
4,TRAGICOMEDY FROM 1941,"The trials and tribulations of a young couple who lose their baby (Dunne miscarries during an earthquake in Japan) then later decide to adopt a little girl. This film is an unusual blend of tragedy/comedy. Irene Dunne was over 40 when she played in this but she can pull it off. Cary Grant was nominated for his first AA. If I remember correctly the film opens with Irene Dunne playing a 78 recording of ""To a Wild Rose"". Edgar Buchannan is memorable as Applejack and Beulah Bondi does usual amazing acting as the head of the adoption agency. This is a rather strange movie, as it has fine elements of comedy and it definitely has tearjerking moments yet the combination is rather uneasy (in retrospect, it always has been), but it definitely makes the eyes water, so be forewarned!"
4,First Rate Schmaltz,I avoided this film for years because of it's tear-jerker reputation. For sure the sentiment is thrown at you in heavy dollops. That said I succumbed to the charm of this film and despite myself wiped away some moisture. Credit director George Stevens for keeping the proceedings solidly grounded from heavy-handedness. The film is also helped by the superb performances by stars Cary Grant and Irene Dunne. The curmudgeonly Edgar Buchanan also provides needed comic relief. Noteworthy is that this is the only film that Grant was nominated for a competitive Oscar. Also of note that Grant's nomination was the only one the film received.
4,robert's review,"In my opinion this movie is inferior to as ""My favorite wife"" or ""The awful truth"". It appeared the characters were just going through the motions of acting to get through the script. I don't believe the team made another movie together."
3,Good film; Annoying DVD,"The other reviews describe the film quite well. Irene Dunn and Cary Grant are entertaining and excellent actors. Edgar Buchanan is great. However, there are a few annoying things about the DVD. There are several places where it skips and jumps. Also, RE has placed their logo in the lower right hand corner of the entire film. I am sure that this will not bother some people, however, I find it quite annoying. I will probably watch this on an old VHS rather than the DVD in the future."
1,"Nice movie, shame about the copy","If, like me, you are looking for classic movies on dvd BEWARE! Mandacy Entertainment are producing sub-standard dvds at a seemingly bargain price. They use movies whose copyrights have run out and slap them on a dics to cash in on the growing popularity of dvd. Do not waste your money!! The transfers are worse than awful. It makes VHS look vastly superior - in fact, it even makes daguerreotypes look superior!As for the movie - it's a sweet sentimental story that's definately worth watching, especially if you are a Cary Grant fan. 4 stars for the movie. 0 stars for the dvd."
3,STILL NOT THE ENTIRE FILM...,"Despite the improved quality of the mastering, this is still not the entire film as released by Columbia Pictures in 1941. This DVD is mastered from a reissue print, and lacks 2 1/2 to 3 minutes of film from the initial release.While those who love the movie regardless of its content or completeness may not be that put-out, purist (like myself) should be warned that this is NOT the entire 120 minute version.SONY needs to pony up and release the consumate version!"
1,This version is missing an important scene!,"I have always enjoyed watching Irene Dunne and Cary Grant in the movies. They made some pretty good ones together, too. The first time I ever saw this movie was on AMC (when there were no commercial interruptions). I cried so hard thru a couple of scenes - it has always been a memorable film to me. I bought this particular DVD to replace my VHS version. This DVD version is missing a key scene, where Roger goes before the judge concerning the adoption of Trina. I cannot believe this scene would be cut - it is very important. The movie itself is pretty clean, considering the age of the movie and that it is not remastered. I would give the movie itself at least 4 stars, but 1 star for the fact it has been cut."
1,ANOTHER BAD SERENADE!!!,"It is impossible to find a decent print of this film. Several years ago, Republic Home Video had a decent tape and laser disc verson of this film which featured the entire 119 minutes of the movie. Since then, no other company (that I have found, anyway) markets the full version; only a nasty, quite damaged 116 or 117 minute edited print from a later release. This ""bad"" print seems to be the one most often utilized for DVD mastering.Please, who ever has access to better source material which features the entire movie, release this film on DVD so that we may enjoy it in a better, more complete form."
5,One of the best tear jerkers on film,"I have watched this movie countless times, and to this day never tire of it! Cary Grant is the husband that dreams are made of! He positively shines in this role. He was one of a kind, and truely shows it here. His pairing with Irene Dunn is perfect as they play well of each other. She is a perfect blend of wholesome & sexy as was the way of things in that era. The interesting way the story told in flashbacks by playing old records and remembering the time they represent covers love, hope, courage, heartache and triumph."
3,"Grant, Dunne & Stevens Elevate This Soaper","This sad soap opera works because of the actors. Cary Grant is excellent in the male lead, adding some good, much-needed comedy in spots. Irene Dunne is very believable in her role as his wife. Edgar Buchanan (""Applejack"") elevates this film with a very likable role and Beulah Bondi's ""Miss Oliver"" looks like the proverbial ""old battle-ax"" but proves to be a very caring person.Another good feature of this film is that it was directed by George Stevens, one of the best of all time.As with all the reviewers here, I have yet to find a good print of this movie. Whether VHS or DVD, it's always a lousy transfer. Even a disc claiming to give us a ""remastered"" version is still no good (see the reviews). This film deserves better."
2,Penny Serenade-,"I was very disappointed in the product. The dvd case was so poorly designed that the dvd could not be held on its spindle and arrived badly scratched. The ""remastered"" copy appears to be a cheap bootleg with cheap paperwork copy, cheap holding case and cheap copying. Not a great copy. Yes, better than some of the others that are available. [...]"
2,DISAPPOINTING SERENADE,"This is a great movie, an old favorite but I was very disappointed in the DVD, it was not restored well.They also deleted a very important scene when Cary Grant appears before the judge. Had I know the quality of the DVD was not good and the scene was deleted I would not have ordered it.The film arrived on time and was packaged well"
1,Very cloudy DVD. Viewing is very difficult. Hurts your eyes.,If I could have given this 0 stars I would have. The DVD was very cloudy and unfocused. It hurt my eyes to watch it. I wonder if it was a recording of a recording that was recorded.
2,"Same Cover, Different Release Date and Company","I purchased this digitally remastered version of Penny Serenade. Although the picture quality of this one was very good(same cover, but mine states it was released by Platinum, 2003), the movie is most definitely cut. Penny Serenade on this DVD did not contain the portion where Cary Grant masterfully pleads to the judge to adopt the child, despite his lack of employment. Grant was nominated for an academy award for that particular performance, which was not included in this version. For that very important reason, I reject this one, good picture quality or not."
2,Nice to Look At But.....,"Lots of good ideas and beautiful projects. However, instructions are terrible...it took us about 30 minutes just to figure out some of the instructions to one of the projects.Definitely great for inspirations, but not a book for the novice."
1,just awful,"I can't believe the CD I listened to is the same as the one reviewed by others who gave it 4 and 5 stars. It is monumentally tedious, all the tracks sound the same. Makes me think of the way commuters feel trudging back to work Monday morning."
3,Helped a little!,This book sounded very interesting but did not live up to my expectations. All the stories sounded the same. It gave some insight into the Amish life but seemed to drag on and on. It held my attention for the first couple of chapters but then I found it hard to keep reading.
4,The dark side of Amish,"Very interesting look into the little know practice of rumspringa, during which the Amish allow their teenagers to experience the dangerous temptations of ""the English."" We usually believe the Amish are rather naive and simple; in truth, they can be just as wild as non-Amish youths. The clinical analysis tended to be rather dry, but the portraits of the Amish youth were fascinating."
2,Rumspringa MIsses the Mark,"Tom Schachtman's work primarily references Old Order Amish in the Elkhart-LaGrange settlement of Indiana. I declined interviews with Mr. Schachtman, but find myself referenced in the book twice. His work is well-written, but becomes superficial because he focuses on the more ""sensational"" stories of Amish youth who struggle with their beliefs. Imagine writing about that small percentage of non-Amish adolescents who are struggling with their identity, the use of drugs and alcohol, and are losing the battle -- and you have Mr. Schachtman's book. The ""twist,"" of course, is the use of Amish youth, and his efforts to critique their culture."
1,Shamefully all-inclusive,"I'm so disappointed in this book. The author makes a very common mistake, one which leads to stereotyping and generalizations. Apparently, the author didn't research enough to know what most of us living near Amish communities know: NOT ALL Amish are alike. NOT ALL Amish allow or partake in rumspringa. The Amish orders have different rules and practices. How embarrassing for this author not to have realized this, even more so to have passed along the misconception."
1,"""could have been way better""","This was a disappointing, choppy read due to the author's excessive use of quotes through the entire book. It was with great relief that I gave up trying to read the disconnected ramblings of ""Rumspringa"""
4,Rumspringa Review,"In recent events of the shooting in the Amish population this past fall, I now can understand why they didn't show emotion, or rather weren't allowed to. This book is a great insight on what Amish teens can choose to do or not do during their period of ""exeriencing Rumspringa."" It opens up to some customs that the Amish have and daily life routines. Our book club really liked the book and took with us new information to share."
5,very interesting and readable,"I knew nothing about the Amish, but I'm interested in adolescence so I picked up a copy of this book and was very quickly absorbed in this story of the fascinating custom rumspringa - the time when Amish teenagers are expected to go out into the world and spend time among non-Amish people before they decide if they want to be baptised into the church and thereby join the Amish community permanently. Shachtman has his psychological theories right and his extensive interviews with Amish teenagers are very engaging. I highly recommend this book."
4,Very good reading,"I appreciated both the interviews and descriptions of Rumspringa and its role in Amish culture, but also the extensions to, and comparisons with, adolescent development and transitions to adulthood in our general American culture. Well written and enjoyable reading."
2,"Fascinating topic, tedious book","The subject certainly is interesting, but the book is poorly written and tedious to read. There appears to be no organizing principle, and as a result we get one anecdote after another, many of them redundant.There are glaring omissions--the author says next to nothing about their language. They all seem to speak English. Although he makes occasional offhand remarks about certain people speaking Pennsylvania Dutch occasionally, he does not bother to mention it otherwise. I was left wondering how widespread the use is, whether or not everyone is bilingual or whether or not it is on the verge of dying out. Sorry, not mentioned here. That's just one example of what's wrong with this book."
3,Interesting but ultimately disappointing,"The book has some interesting parts to is, but I found it flawed: (1) The writing is not particularly strong; maybe the author was trying to mirror the Amish sense of ""plain,"" but it doesn't make for enjoyable reading; (2) Like the previous reviewer, ""RI Mom,"" I too think this book was more about Amish life in general, with only scant interviews with young people actually in rumspringa; and (3) The book was unfocused, the information being repeated across various chapters, as if they were originally articles and now have been put together to try to form a book. From the reviews, it sounds as if seeing the documentary by the author is a better bet, along with reading a different book on the topic."
3,"Interesting concept, annoying book","While the author clearly possesses an amazing amount of insider knowledge and abundant facts, the text is ponderous to read. The combination of an incoherent structure and overused quotation marks makes the reading quite unenjoyable.That said, I am continuing to read because I am so fascinated by the subject matter."
4,Interesting,"Tho this book may not be ""Not that Orginal"" or ""Academic"" as some reviewers have said, it is still original and as for being academic or not, who cares? Does a book always have to be academic? Academic means: ""Of, relating to, or characteristic of a school, especially one of higher learning"". Regardless of whether or not the book has some association with being written by a scholar or is or isn't related to Yale or Harvard in some way, it's an interesting an honest record of what part of the teen culture is like in the Amish community during Rumspringa.I found it useful in that it informed me as to how to better approach such teens with the true gospel.The one thing I did not like about this book was it was too vague concerning what was meant by ""the English"". I wanted to know what exactly the Amish considered ""English""; is it only non-Amish whites, or any who isn't Amish that lives in America?"
4,A great devotional resource,"I am a new pastor and would highly recommend this prayer book. The anthology of writings on the Holy Ministry is a fantastic collection that will give a clergyman plenty of food for thought. I would even recommend it to seminarians who are preparing for the ministry so they begin praying for the needs of the congregations to which they will be called early on. Likewise the anthology would be helpful in pastoral formation of seminarians. I don't mind the old language and grammar, but I guess that is a question of personal taste. I would recommend this to clergyman of any denomination."
5,This book was fantastic!,"My mom and I read this book together. I really liked that the animals could talk to the humans. I was a good story. I liked it when they went around the world, reading about all the different places and the animals that lived there. - Marie, age 7 and mom."
4,One Hit Wonder - But a Good One,"Sometime back many moons ago, I read about Unlimited Nation and their song ""Move Your Body"". The reviews were fairly positive and thanks to that new thing called the ""Internet"" (remember this was back around 1996-1997), I was able to secure a copy of the song.All in all, not a bad song. It's your typical eurodance song with a female vocal and on some of the mixes, the male rapper. The 5 mixes on the single are decent. The best are the house and the sub-sonic house mixes. The house mix is a bit of misnomer as it seems to be more of a Eurodance Mix. The sub-sonic mix is a more instrumental/club track which is good.Basically, it's available used and worth a look if you like the old Eurodance sound back from the mid to late 90's. Plus, it's a rarity as Unlimited Nation only released one song and that was it!!"
1,This book is uncommonly poor.,"I have never been inspired to comment on any product I have purchased here, but this book demands it. It is a random collection of mindless ramblings and essays that have little or nothing to do with the preparation, strategy, or reality of a custody battle.If you are considering purchasing this book, do yourself a favor and find a copy to browse before committing. Read a few passages and ask yourself what if anything it has to do with your situation.I found this book to be 100% useless. Although it is unfortunate to waste one's money on such an item, it is by far more frustrating to waste one's time searching for useful information where there is none. Good luck with your fight."
5,6 Stars out of 5 ... Just Do It!,"Great resource, Interesting reading, Much more than I had hoped for. Don't let it overwhelm you. Use the Table of Contents and Index and take it one step at a time. The best money I spent on my custody case was on this book. Powerful, wonderful, enlightening. I highly recommended this book."
5,I have them all.,Read a review of 'Win' in the Modesto Bee several years ago. I remeber because I cut it out for the shop steward at work. Then things went to #&%@ around here and I saw a battered copy of 'Win' two months ago at a Father's for Equal Rights meeting. The guy who had it used a hi-lighter so much I thought the pages were supposed to be yellow. Tried to buy his but he wouldn't give it up. This edition looks to have twice the information his 99 edition. When the smoke clears around here I'll take the time to read it from cover to cover. For now I use the index and a blue hi-lighter. My marriage status may be changing but my parental status is going to stay the same. I am a good dad.I have every one of the custody books www.Amazon.com could get for me. 'Win' is the most complete. Highly Recommended!
4,"Second book in ""My Friend Flicka"" trilogy","This wonderful book is great for anyone who loves horses, especially teenagers.Ken's mare, Flicka, has a white colt, a throwback to its grandfather, the wild and wicked stallion, the Albino. His father hates the Albino and thinks no good will come of any of its progeny. Ken loves the colt regardless. The colt is so ugly and has such a scrabbling gallop that although his mother named it Thunderhead, it gets known as The Goblin. The Goblin escapes out onto the range and isn't seen again for a year, when it demonstrates such an unusual gait and such speed that Ken secretly thinks he has a racehorse who can help the money problems his parents have on the ranch. The story continues with problems between Ken and his father, between Thunderhead and Banner, his father's range stallion, and between Thunderhead and the Albino."
1,Not a how to book at all,"I bought this book hoping it would help me plan and grow a Texas garden. It's just a book about other people's gardens, and often it didn't even describe the plants used in each or even the planning process. Nice photos. Not a how to book."
5,Loaded with Lots of beautiful pictures! Very inspiring!,"This book shows several different Texas landscapes using natives. There are no detailed planting diagrams, but there are Loads of very high quality beautiful pictures of the landscapes showcased. The photos are so nice, that they have really inspired me! There is a written description of each example landscape and the story behind it. The descriptions under the photos point out the different plants used. Bottom line: I love this book! Now you know what to expect from this book. I am glad I have it, I like to go back and browse through it every so often."
2,A little disappointed,I did not find this book as useful as I had hoped. It was not a resource of garden design or plant material for the native garden.
5,Beautiful and practical gardens,For one who loves books they visit libraries and book stores to just smell the paper. Well that works for lovers of gardens also. This book contains picture of beautiful and practical gardens. I have to admit I bought it for pictures of my favorite garden that people come from neighboring states to see. That is Weston Gardens (designed by Randy Weston). Ninety percent of my plants and ideas come form walking through Weston gardens. Many of the other gardens also have practical ideas for Texas gardens
1,"Dreck, dreck, dreck","Unless you're addicted to Thorazine, this disc is utterly without reason of any type. I kept waiting for some music to begin, or some of the noise to coalesce into something of merit but alas, the album concluded without a hope. If a coma excites you, buy this loser."
2,Misleading CD cover,"I wanted the complete Evita soundtrack, and this rendition was terribly disappointing. The cd ends abruptly mid story. Voices are spectacular of course, but the cover suggests this is the original London peformance and a buyer, like me, expects the entire musical score. I wouldn't buy this again."
3,"Pretty good, but OBC is better...","plus this is not the entire score, just most of the songs. Elaine is fine, David Essex OK. Joss Ackland is mostly known as a dramatic actor, not a singer, in movies such as the original ""Shadowlands."" I'd recommend the Original Broadway Cast over this, but if you're a true ""Evita"" fan, this one is good for your collection if only to compare..."
2,MISSING SO MANY GOOD SONGS,"THANK GOODNESS FOR THE BROADWAY PRODUCTION OF EVITA! THIS MUSCIAL IS VERY GOOD, YET IT HAS SOME WEAK SPOTS, BUT THAT DOSN'T MEAN LONDON SHOULD TAKE THEM OUT IN THE FIRST STAGE PRODUCTION OF EVITA. THERE ARE A LOT OF MISTAKES AND THINGS THEY SHOULD OF ADDED. HERE'S A LIST.*THEY SHOULD OF ADDED 'RAINBOR TOUR' I LOVE THAT SONG*BUENOS AIRES SHOULD OF BEEN LONGER*A NEW ARGETINA SHOULD OF BEEN LONGER*THEY SHOULD OF ADDED 'DICE ARE ROLLING"" ANYTHING THAT HAS THE 'A NEW ARGETINA' MUSIC I JUST LOVE.*THE COVER LOOKS TOO OLD. IF THEY WERE GONNA PUT IT ON A CD, THEY SHOULD OF MADE A NEW LOOK OR COVER.*IT SHOULD OF HAD 23 SONGS INSTEAD OF 15THERE ARE A LOT MORE REASONS WHY THIS CD WAS DREADFULL BUT I DON'T WANT TO WASTE YOUR TIME. I SAY BUY THE ORIGINAL BROADWAY CAST WITH THE EXELLENT PATTIE LuPONE. WHO CARES ABOUT THAT ESSEX GUY."
3,Beware; Excerpts,"I bought this thinking it was the entire show. It's missing some of my favorite songs, such as ""Rainbow Tour."" Elaine Paige is great, but I don't care much for David Essex as Che."
3,Iluvmusic2,"This is a can't miss performance by the London cast of Evita; however for enjoyable listening, I would recommend listening to the Madonna version before spending $$ for this version."
2,flawed refill design,"The blades are too far recessed behind the moisture strips and didn't shave nearly as close as my old Gillette razor. The package doesn't deliver on the promise to go ""a day or two"" without needing to shave again, as id didn't shave close the first time!"
4,It's painfully expensive to stay pain-free.,"Great for my skin, lousy for my wallet. I have tried Venus, Intuition, and a number of other pricey razors, and this is the one that's my match. I know women who feel the opposite way, so try before you buy a large quantity. This keeps getting more expensive, so I've tried new razors again, but I keep coming back to this. Other razors cut my skin to ribbons or leave red, itchy bumps.The blades last much, much longer on hair that's < 1mm long. If I need to shave something longer and I have an older blade around, I'll swap them. Longer hair takes forever to rinse out, and even then it seems to end the blade, so I keep this to legs and underarms only. It has no problem with corse, thick hair."
1,Works terribly,"I wish I had a good experience with this razor; I was giving it as much credit as I could, but it simply does not live up to its supposed reputation at all. It barely cuts hair, let alone gives a close shave. True it doesn't cut my skin, but I'd rather that than waste my time with hair that isn't even cut. I thought maybe the default head was faulty or didn't have as sharp of blades, so I replaced it. I had the same result with the new head. I would not recommend this at all. I would just buy a men's razor. If it's good enough for a man's face, it's good enough for my legs and other regions."
1,Complete distortion of the bible and science,"I wonder why the young-earth creationists (whom are rabid antievolutionists) swear by this book, the bible of their movement, because its theories need evolution to explain their ""global"" flood. Most are shocked to hear this but it is true. And contrary to young-earth claims, most old earthers don't believe in evolution and DO believe in a literal bible. For a book on the topic which doesn't support evolution, and doesn't make up science and supports a literal bible, see Hugh Ross' ""The Genesis Question."""
5,Time to Retire This Book,"When this book was written, it represented some of the best thinking on how to match the Genesis account of creation with modern science. But as the years have gone by, not only has science expanded, but biblical scholars have also delved deeper into the scriptures to find new insights.This was a great book in it's time, but it is time to retire this book and find something newer.For the record, I believe in biblical creation and am not trying to bash that concept. But this book has outlived it's usefulness."
1,Not the greatest,"I was pleased with my order process, just not the book. It arrived when promised and was in great quality. However, the book was not that great of a book on the flood. Another book we ordered was a much better book."
4,A Classic,An excellent yet in depth (no pun intended) book on the Great Flood. It can get technical since Henry Morris was a scientist but that only goes to show the amount of effort he put forth into writing the book. The book shames old earth ages and Darwinistic evolution in general. Highly recommended reading.
2,Book is totally out of date,"We now have DNA studies that show that all mammals (including humans) are related each other. This book (trying to prove all mammals aren't related to each other, in sections of the book) may have held up well in the 60's and 70's and even 80's but now it's totally worthless."
1,oh good God,"people, this is not science! how many times must it be said? like i've said before, i have nothing against people who believe in a young earth, but when you diss those who believe in an old earth (progressive creationists, theistic evolutionists, etc.), call their ideas unscientific nonsense, and say there's no way for God to have used evolution, then i don't tolerate you. i believe in theistic evolution, and see no conflict between my faith in God, and evolution. i personally believe theistic evolution is the most reasonal belief, and the most scientific. i can't wait till all this yec stuff goes away."
2,Mt Heights,"A THOUGHT:The mountains may have been a lot lower pre-flood -- since the rain had not yet gathered intothe Great Deep.The great weight of the water may have been enough (later) to raise enormous plates (like Anapurna and Everest)to the fantastic heights we see today.Thus, the primeval surface of the earth (during the Flood) may have been much lower, until Isostatic forcespushed down to lower great ocean basins and produce the rise of great mountain ranges.Even today, scientists inform us the surface of the earth is much smoother than an orange. Imagine a liquidfilm covering an orange and there you have perhaps, the situation (in miniature) that existed during the Noachian Deluge."
1,To Arlene Cruz: you are the dummy!,The poster you are referring to actually said that it is 100% genetically proven we are related to chimps not that it was proven that we are genetically 100% identical to chimps. DNA studies can confirm people's relationships with other people showing common ancestors back more than 1000 years they can certainly do it with man and ape and they have. The Bible donates a few measly paragraphs to the start of man you expect everything about man's origins to be written there. As for the book The Genesis Flood itself well it does have fake info on man's origins but the illustrations were neat like of the dog or fox or whatever.
1,itellectual dishonesty,"an appalling misuse of the word science. If this book deserves a place in a library, it's in the sci-fi/fantasy section."
1,A Waste of Paper,"Christianity also opposed at one time the concept that the Sun is at the center of the solar system - who among religious fanatics want to argue THAT cause these days? Give it up - if your religion can not tolerate accepting truths such as the fact that the Earth is billions of years old, or the fact that organisms evolve, then your religion is as doomed as the dinosaurs and the dodo."
3,techical but excellant,"This is a wonderful book full of information that supports the biblical account of creation. To me, it was a little technical and tedious which made the reading less enjoyable. That is why I gave it 3 stars instead of 5. For a person who likes that sort of reading I would give it a 5 star rating. For this reason I would not recomment this particular book for teenagers or children. There are others that these men have written that are more to the point,less techinal and easier to read. This book contains volumes of factual scientific information that has been handled honestly. To the true searcher of facts I would highly recomment this book."
4,Good bait ok skirt.,Bought this cuz it can fish day and night.The skirt didn't reach expectations. It doesn't run smoothly but with some hairs sticking out. Still Booyah is my favorite spinnerbait and with some adjustments it will be another of Booyah's great products. Just don't but from here as it will double your price and might get your orders wrong.
1,Hard to read,I had to read this book for my college Philosophy course. Even the professor said it was a tough read. I find it very difficult to follow.
5,Great book,"The story is really cute, and the artwork is fun. The pages seem like a lot is going on, but it makes it very interesting to read it all. It's captivating for a child. I was so surprised when I read this book because it could have been written about our family!!! We, or mostly, I, did so much research on the best breed for our family considering we have two younger boys. Finally, I discovered, The Labradoodle. Their personalities and owner opinions of them sold me, not to mention they were the cutest dogs we saw. We ended up getting one, and she's the best!!! To find a story about this was really neat."
4,Wow,"This is a good picture book. My 6 year old daughter really loved it. She is currently on a ""I want a dog kick"" and this book, which I already owned, hit the spot for her. After we read it, she kept it on her bed so she could look at later. True, it isn't presenting encyclopedic type information, but I rarely buy picture books for that reason. The book is presented with a main typed text and associated asides in hand written form which makes it seem more intimate, i.e. Amelia's Diary and such. The art work reminded me of Maira Kalman type which I personally like a lot. It isn't perfect though. I think German Shepherd Dogs are the perfect pet and any book that wouldn't have the child in the end picking a GSD is a little crazy."
1,Bad Book!,"I saw the title of this book and was so excited. I was going to get it for my Goddaughter, who desperately wants a dog. Fortunately, I read this book cover to cover and was greatly surprised that the author knew so little about the breeds before writing about them.I am a member of a great dane rescue and was DEVASTATED by the comments regarding the great dane in the book, stating ""it might snap at children"". Other than a dane that has been abused, nothing could be farther from teh truth!! Danes are WONDERFUL with children!! I WOULD NOT purchase this book for any child. It does not give a true discirption of the breeds it refers to.Bad research. Author should know better!"
1,"Actually, this IS the place for your comments","Don't understand why most people are attacking another for her review. So you don't agree - then just right a freakin review of the book instead of attacking someone. Besides, she didn't mention one word about not liking labradoodles. I like the artwork in this book, but agree, as someone who works with rescued animals, that the author could have done a little more research."
5,Works well without flash.,Product works well only when used without flash unit on. If flash operates it creates a shadow in the finished photo. When used with sufficient light and without the flash unit on this lens delivers quality photos.
4,"I like it,,,BUT....","I Like the wide angle...BUT...DON'T USE THE FLASH WITH THE WIDE AGLE! Otherwise it is a Great Product and the Price is Good!Thaks,C.A."
3,Fairly average,"The items was fairly dusty and seem like it has been used already, but I brought it "" new"". So, I'm fairly not satisfy. Also, they didn't take the time to package the itm neatly. It was crumble up in a newspaper and the box for the converter was open."
3,"Nice idea, but wrong camera.","Bought this wide angle lens and adapter for my Canon A70 to shoot lots of interior shots of rooms, as I am a house remodeler. Lens makes great wide shots to encompass a small room and all its features. Where this lens fails in that the size of the adapter and lens is so large hanging out the front of the camera that it blocks half of the flash when shooting. The result is that most of the entire right half of your photos will be dark or have a prominate shadow. This camera is the second A70 I have had because it has all the features I needed and makes great photos otherwise. My only workaround this shadow problem is to now invest more money into a slave strobe unit. All combined, its making the cost of this camera skyrocket, compared with investing in a higher grade digital camera with interchangable lenses and flash adapters."
2,Barrel Distortion,I bought the converter since I wanted to use it for landscape photography. I took some test shots and discovered that the converter has an unacceptable amount of barrel distorion. If you are thinking about buying this product just be aware that you will have to correct your images through software after you take them.
2,Not a great product,"I purchased this wide angle lens for my digital camera. When I was experimenting with it taking photos inside my house, there was a dark shadow in the lower right hand portion of the photo. When I took a photo outside, there was no shadow. I went to my local camera shop to ask for help in this matter and he said I would need to adjust the white balance according to the light in the room, but he said, in reality, 'these digital cameras are really not meant for attachments'. I did experiment with the light balance, but still had no luck in getting that dark area to disappear.The flash on the camera is not strong enough to compensate for the area the lens blocks. I returned the product."
5,Great addition,I wanted a wider view for the camera and this converter took care of it beutifully. I'm very happy with it.
3,Decent book,"Before buying this book make sure that you know C++ and MFC programming, otherwise this book will not help you. To begin with using MFC confused me to begin with because the reader had to worry about the MFC implementation AND the DirectX implementation. Using the Win32 SDK would make some of the early examples easier to understand. But after reading the whole book I realized that using MFC with DirectX can be a powerful tool. The thing I really loved about this book was that it encapsulated all of the discussed DirectX components into classes. Writing DirectX code is relatively hard to remember (the concept is easy though) and therefore the classes make DirectX easier to use. It's great to be able to focus on programming for your individual application and not programming DirectX. I would recommend this book to intermediate/advanced C++/MFC programmers who want to learn DirectX."
4,the book is worth purchasing,"I like the book, as it gives me a good idea of what to do with DirectX in an MFC context. I picked it up because I found it difficult to properly place in context the information in the directX help files. I also found the book was very handy in that I was making the jump from Borland C++ 4.5 to visual C 6. The early chapters where very handy for getting over simple ""usage"" issues with the complier.I was disapointed that directX media SDK was not covered as that is what I most interested in, but its likely best presented as a seperate book and in any event its not part of the basic DirectX SDK.I will certainly purchase other books by these authors"
2,"Sparsely annotated code, rough writing, good scope.","While the book covers DirectX with substantial depth and range, the authors present code that is sparsely annotated, and in the accompanying text they leave out a lot of explanation. As someone fairly new to C++, I found the authors' leaps and assumptions hard to cope with. An additional minor irritation was that the authorship and editing seemed amateur. The writing style wandered from sterile third-person, to corny and lame. My overall impression is that the book was rushed to market, and needs to be refined, polished, and released in a new edition."
2,Specific Direct Sound Complaints,This review is directed towards the section on Direct Sound. It completely ignores audio capture. It also only includes discussion and code about playing sound files which fit in the sound buffer. It ignores the more difficult task of dealing with longer data streams which require event handling. Instead there are many pages on the WAV file format.
4,"Good Book, Poor Reviewrs","I found the book very good for someone new to Direct X especially if you want it to tie into MFC.As for the reviewers who complained about it not running on NT. DirectX only works on NT 5/2000 not NT 4. If you do not already know this you probably need to go back and learn some straight Win32 API programming.And yes if you want to program Direct X you sure better know how to program in C/C++ and COM as well as understand ""BASIC"" oop methadologies. I am tired of these reviews that have no merit behind them. If you do not know what you are talking about...do not write a review."
1,Don't waste your money here !!!!,"I would've rated this a ten star (negative) if it was available because it certainly isn't even worth one. I am running this under Windows NT, (the book says I can), and all I receive is a bunch of Access Violations from the samples.And why should I have to go to newsgroups for help when I just spent a bundle of money on a book which should contain sample code that works !!!"
1,CDROM samples don't compile,This seems like an excellent book but be prepared to go to the newsgroups for help when compiling the samples included on the cdrom. One would expect that the supplied examples - particularly ( HELLO WORLD ) in CHAPTER #1 would compile cleanly without the following generated error in two different places !!!!!C:\Complete\Chapter HelloWorld\HelloWorld.cpp(108) : error C2440: '=' : cannot convert from 'void *' to 'struct HBRUSH__ *' Conversion from 'void*' to pointer to non-'void' requires an explicit cast
1,This book attempts to explain directx but fails.,"blah blah blah That is what this book is, nothing. Sorry but it is. I would not suggest it to anyone. I would though, like to challenge someone out there to write a cabable DirectX book. Thanks."
2,Hardly Complete,"If you're interested in Direct3D skip this one. In contradiction with its title, it glosses over 3D graphics entirely."
3,Read what the book features BEFORE you buy it!,"All thoose who say this book is no good because it does'nt describe Direct3D and other stuff, I have one suggestion: If you want to buy a book see if it features what you want! And if you buy it and it does'nt feature what you want DO NOT POST IT HERE! You only send a negative message of the book, even if it is good at the things IT DO FEATURE!"
3,RING TWO takes you in Circles.,"Only being a moderate fan of horror films, THE RING cleverly took a ridiculous concept and drew you in until the end. The chills were often without being overdone. Now, THE RING TWO attempts to add to story, without straying too far from the original concept. For the most part, it succeeds. At least, it succeeds in the apprehension department. You spend more time feeling the tension preparing for something bad to happen than actually witnessing any horrifying images. Fans of the original won't be disappointed, but they won't be elated either. THE RING TWO is a fine extension to the franchise without ruining the story of the original. And you don't need to watch the RINGS DVD to bridge the gap, unless you are in dire need to complete the set."
5,"VERY ,VERY, VERY, SCARY",Hello my name is Karen and this movie is very scary. I went to see it yesterday and it's all ready giving me nightmares. Please I repeat see this movie.
1,This movie should NOT have been made.,"This movie is not as scary as it is annoying! Samara just standing there, floating towards people, arms out, hair in face....oooohhhh I'm scared!! Oh, and there's a scene with killer attack deer! Oooohhhh....even more scary! Digital attack deer are NOT scary. Was this movie made by the Wayans brothers? Finally, how can you make a movie scary when you put Lumberg from Office Space in it? C'mon....Lumberg for crying out loud?!?! I thought he was going to ask Samara if she got the memo about the cover sheets for the TPS reports!The first Ring was great!! Scary, good story, good plot and characters etc. It was a real original. I wish this one was never made and/or I never saw it. Do not tarnish your memory of the first movie by watching this dud."
1,More funny then scary as bad as scary movies get..One of the worst sequals ever!!!,The trailers looked so good for the Ring Two but when iw atched it I was left laughing and disapointed. The Ring was a good movie not great but good and of course with horror films there is a sequal. This movie is bad and I mean bad it's more funny then scary. There are such stupid and pointless parts that leave you think what where they thinking. The movie draged on and on and on I just wanted it to end. Overall dont waste your time it's just stupid.
2,A Truly unnessessary Sequel,This is The Ring 2. Sequel to the highly popular Ring. This is one of those types of movies that don't have to be made. But don't wet your pants when you see it. It's so predictible. This follows up to the original movie. Where we find Rachel and her son (Can't remember the name) going to a diffrent town to escape that creepy little girl. She finds out that the evil tape has been viewed. (Apparently they don't know about DVD. I don't know maybe there saving that for Ring 3: The search for more money). The little boy is more scary than that girl. Normally I give movies like this a one but seeing that I jumped at a part I didn't see coming I'll give it a 2.
2,Just trying to stay alive,This movie isnt all that good as the first one.It seems just like a way to keep the ring one alive.The girl samara misses her mother and wants to take over the boys body.Comon you can do better.It wasnt all that scary either.The grudge was better.In the ring 2 it was to good but i might still buy it .The first one was better.
2,What Were They Thinking?,"The Ring was one of those rare good horror movies. It was original, suspenseful, with good directing and acting. The Ring 2 is boring. It relies heavily on special effects, and the effects are good, but seem to be largely a means to their own end. Naomi Watts is a good actress, who really upped her credibility with Mulholland Drive; I have to wonder what she was thinking when she signed on for this sad part-two drivel. Maybe she signed before actually seeing the script.And what's with the deer? Sure, it's cool to see them attack the car, but why? Really? And why just deer? Why not other wildlife? Why don't psychotic squirrels attack, too, or chipmunks? Or are horned ruminants the only ones affected by Water Girl?Dumb."
1,Avoid this one...,"This is the first horror movie I have seen in several years from a major studio that had not ONE scary moment in it (the only scene that worked in any way, shape, or form, was the one involving the deer... I won't spoil it for you). The eerieness of the kid in the movie (that worked fairly well in the first Ring) is gone, now that the kid looks like a teenager. And the spooky comments he made in the first are totally lost in this sequel. Do yourself a favor, rent the original Japanese version of the first Ring... avoid this one.Just by way of background, and while other reviewers seems to prefer to reveal much of the story and plot, I think that sort of ruins the film in many cases. So, you'll want to look for other reviews and reviewers if that is what you are looking for..."
5,"""The Ring Two"" is intriguingly scary!","""The Ring Two"" is intriguingly scary! It is an impressive follow-up to the original ""The Ring"" (2002), which are both remakes of Japanese horror films. Naomi Watts and David Dorfman return in the roles that they originated in the original ""The Ring"" (2002). Hideo Nakata (in his American film debut), who did the original Japanese versions of ""The Ring"" & ""The Ring Two"" returns to direct the American remake."
4,"IF YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR YOU, DON'T BUY THIS VERSION!!","This unrated version of the movie is horrible. When I bought it, I knew this ""unrated"" version wasn't gonna have what a NORMAL Unrated DVD has(wink wink) but this is ridiculous. I am here to tell you right now that the rated version is so much better. There was only one shot in the entire ""unrated"" part that I thought was cool and I look like a nerd because of it. Other than that, everything is cool. Movie=5 out of 5.DVD, however=2 out of 5. Just buy the PG-13 one. PLEASE! You won't miss anything here."
2,Not As Good As The Original....,"I never thought The Ring... part 1 was a great movie. I just found it ok. To me, not scary or creepy enough. After watching The Ring Two, I tend to prefer part one to this sequel. Although not a terrible movie, The Ring Two is kinda boring as it is too much like part one for me. I don't regret renting it but for anyone who hasn't seen it, don't be prepared to be blown away."
2,boring sequel to a good first version.,"I don't understand why they insisted in making this american version of ringu 2 so different from the japanese movie and so different from the original book.What was Hideo Nakata thinking? he did a good job in the japanese Ringu series but here he messed up. Samara wants a mom??? come on that is plain out ridiculous. The deer scene was way over the top, and surely taken from the safari park scene from The Omen. Sissy Spacek is a great actress, but why does she have such a small role in the movie???The movie was boring and didn't have any scary moments. they over did the special effects and they changed the orginal story so much that it lost its essence...."
2,the ring 'all over again',"This film is useless.It alienates those who haven't seen THE RING, and bores those who have to tears.Recycled concept from the first film only not nearly as scary or interesting.Terrible CGI sequence with wild deer in the middle. Felt like a silly kid's movie.I was pleasantly suprised to see the lovely Emily Van Camp (Everwood)for the opening ten minutes. Probably the only redeeming feauture in the film (in my opinion).I have no use for this film."
1,SKIP IT,"I loved the creepiness of The Ring. It genuinely got under your skin, with its glimpses into the life and death of Samara, one of the most disturbing evil children in the movies. This sequel is a tepid and absurd attempt to joggle thrills out of virtually nothing. Samara's twisted life, which was still ripe for the picking, is abandoned; in its place, a slow-moving possession tale emerges. Once again, Naomi Watts is asked to run all over creation to track down clues, etc. -- but this time, there is no palpable terror in any of it. You simply don't care. It's a shame, because in some ways, it destroys the terror of the first Ring. This one didn't even get a shudder from me - and the audience I saw it with, largely teen girls, didn't scream once. No fun!"
3,The Ring Two-Bigger Better-scares,I hated the original.The only interesting(not scary)part was when Samara came out of the tele.That was odd.The Ring Two was cool.It had way more action seqences and kept me interested.Especially that one scene when Samara attacked Aidan in the bathroom-it was weird.Buy this its worth it.Just don't buy Halloween-Season of the witch.
5,daimond ring,"i can't wait to see the second episode of ring series ,as it's expand our horizons and enrich our imaginations with new perspective of hororr."
2,ewwwww,"the first one was only scary about 2 times. What is with every good japanese horror movie being copied. The Japanese ones are always better, and dont you forget it."
2,Are sequels ever good?,"The Ring 2 was definately different from the first. I have to admit, I was not a fan of The Ring--I found it to be rather boring, but it's pretty great compared to the sequel. The Ring 2 has a completely different storyline..it's not about a crazy little girl trying to kill people through a videotape anymore. Now it's focusing on Samara trying to get Rachel to be her mother.....Not too interesting.There are a few scenes with pop-outs or loud music..but other than that, this movie was pretty uneventful. I felt that is was just lacking something..maybe it just needed a stronger plot or more terror scenes..I'm not really sure..but all in all, I found it to be quite boring."
3,"It's OK,....But Doesn't Come Close To the First One","I can't say that this movie was bad. It did hold my interest and had the mystery element thatthe first one had. It also had the great creepy music that added so much to the orginal. However, it just cannot live up the the orginal. ""The Ring"" was truly unique and THE best horror film of the last two decades. It was obvious that a sequel would be a dispointment, but luckly, they kept the original actors.This flim does have one classic scene, though. The very end in the well was truly a great filming sequence. It definitely had me on the edge of my seat.If u loved the original, you owe it to yourself to check this one out too....but don't expect too much."
3,It's OK,"The sequel to the Ring was ok, but nothing to brag about. I hope they just stop now. If they do make a third installment they need to let John Carpenter Direct it and have the plot based on some cynical reporter who doubts the mythical power of the mythical video tape decides to play it on national tv on a news show. Naoomi Watts desperately tries to stop the tape from being played, after she escapes from an insane asylum only to be too late. The movie ends with people turning on their TV sets around only to view the Samara Tape.But I would be just as happy if they left it alone.And please hollywood don't touch Spiral"
2,This is Theatrical FULL-SCREEN Version,"For some reason, the theatrical version seems to ONLY be available in full-screen version. Widescreen is only in the ""Unrated"" edition, which for a collector is extremely disappointing.Movie itself has a few chills and is worth having, but suffers from having similar problems of superior sequels (Fly II, Robocop 2 are good examples) in that, though they have their moments, are far too uneven and emotionally spastic to really draw an audience in to satisfy. The original is considered far superior, even if great effort is expended on the sequel (and it shows here).Main problem is theatrical version does not seem to exist in WIDESCREEN as it should. If I am wrong about this, please let me know, but I fail to understand this type of release format problem on this particular film."
1,One word: PHEW!,"If smell were a part of the moviegoing experience, this stinker would drive people out of their seats. ""The Ring Two"" is not even the slightest bit scary. In fact, I couldn't wait for it to end. I would have left had I not paid $20 for my wife and I to see it, which is money and time I'll never get back.""The Ring"" was so creepy and visceral that it stuck with me for a while after I saw it. ""The Ring Two"" was/is so smelly that my dog would roll around on it. Don't waste your time on this re-hash which was an obvious attempt to make more money."
3,"Ok Film, Not as good as the First","I went an seen this movie yesterday. Like my title say's it's an ""OK"" Movie. Some of the effects were COOL but as for the story line... That's another story. I feel they could of did a WAY better job on it. All in All the first movie was the best of the best."
2,What happened?,"The Ring was so scary, and its sequel is just a bore. It relies on special fxs and no good story. The scares are no where in the 110 minutes of the movie. A total disappointment."
4,"Now, a few years old, this is the right price for it","It is a decent sequel, and less than ten dollars is about what its worth. It is fine to watch, and as horror sequels go, it wasn't the worst. It continues the story, brings the villian back, and sort of gives a little more power to do so to our heroine, Rachel.Anytime a movie tries to go after the child we cringe a bit, but Aiden, as unresponsive as he always kind of was (and just a little creepy) we feel a little less for him and more of Rachel as the mother.The movie has the moments where we are dreading the loud ""pop"" scenes, as well as hoping for Samara just to leave them alone, but it offers a little more into her background as well.Overall, I recommend it."
3,Ring-A-Ding-Ding...,"THE RING TWO should have been great. It had everything going for it- Naomi Watts and David Dorfman reprise their roles, and it's helmed by the director of the japanese originals RINGU 1 AND 2. However, my hopes for a classic were soon dashed as I watched another so-so sequel unfold. Gone is the grim, cold atmosphere of impending doom that made THE RING such a wonderfully dark experience. Instead, we get a cartoonish, computer-animated deer attack and a very non-threatening Samara! I will always enjoy the first RING, long after this one fades from memory..."
2,Waste Of Time,Ring Two wasn't scary at all and though I was sad when the cute guy got killed there was really nothing to really comment about except it was pretty boring. If you want to get creeped out watch Boogyman or Saw 1 or 2
1,The Original is always the best...,"Anyone who claims to be a fan of ""The Ring"" might want to see the original Japanese ""Ringu"" which was released in the USA shortly after ""The Ring""'s DVD release. I've seen both, back to back, and compared, and ""Ringu"" in the original Japanese, is far superior to the Amercian remake."
1,I Am Scared And Not Ashamed,"I am scared of what this movie will be like. The Ring was terrifying enough, but now that it is scheduled to have a sequel, our theaters are going to be seriously plagued for the next few months after its release. If you are a giggling 11 year old thrill seeker whose only reason to watch this movie is to have an adrenalin rush brought on by sheer, mad, terror, I have some advice for you: DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT. I still have nightmares from the first movie. At least now I have the benefit of foreshadowing here: Come November 10, 2004, I am going to stay out of the movie theaters, because I don't fancy looking over my shoulder for Semirah every time I pass a lighthouse or a well. I'm glancing at my TV now, in fact, just in case..."
2,A Competent Waste of Time,"I really liked the original THE RING. That a PG-13 film could attain such a level of creepiness has been a lost art in the horror film.The sequel is a bland mess. The computer-generated deer scene is lifted from THE OMEN (and makes less sense here). Most of the sequences feel disjointed. Naomi Watts is excellent, as always, but the story is just too underdeveloped.It could've been an interesting franchise."
2,Not as good as the first.,"The Ring Two definatly is not as good as the first. The deer thing was kind of wierd but in the first remember the horse went crazy so animals do get affected by it. I felt like they were try to remind us of everything from the first one like, oh remember the tape and remeber the people's faces getting all weird and remember the light house and the girl can come through the screen and water floods the house. But Naomie Watts was really hot in it."
3,sequel?....pretty good,"The Ring 2 does what most sequels can't seem to achieve. It manages to stand on it's own, and provide the same eerie qualities of the first movie, without just being a remake of the origional. While it does lack some of the creepy qualities of the The Ring, it still manages to develop the story line in a way that gives the viewer a different, more in depth look at the story behind the girl, and the family we see glimpses of in the origional. Considering the challenges that film makers face when making a sequel that lives up to the expectations of viewers, I would say that The Ring 2 is definately worth seeing. If you liked the first one, you will probably enjoy this sequel."
3,Surprisingly good,"I actually prefered Ring two to the Ring, The first was fun and kind of creepy, but seemed very rote to me if you were watching these Japanese horror remakes. What I liked about Ring two was that I felt a lot more emotion in the characters and I felt it built on the first with shades of Poltergest and the Omen. There just seemed to be more of an emotional connection between the character that brought a litle more depth to this.Sissy Spacek and Elizabeth Perkins have some cool cameos and the mother son relationship seemed more intense. Not horrifying, but chilling and unexpected compare to The Ring.Worth a view."
1,"They should have stopped with ""THE RING""","This movie was not scary. It wasn't even interesting. I only watched it until the end because i paid to rent it. They should have stopped with ""THE RING"" because this movie ruined the whole story. What a waste. I hope there won't be a RING 3 because that kid is really getting annoying."
5,Much Better than The Theatrical Version,With the additional scenes this is a much better movie than the original theatrical version. Samara is awesome!!
1,Really Stupid Sequel.,"This was a very dumb movie. I loved the first one, it was dark, scary, and unpleasent. This one sucks, not very dark at all, NOT SCARY, and a very happy stupid ending. After watching this i was ready to take a crap on the film reel. This movie sux!"
1,Wish I'd seen that damn tape and died a week later so I couldn't have seen the sequel,"Have you seen Scary Movie 3? Remember that cheesy part with the scary Ring-like girl and the whole let's be a family thing? Well, it took Scary Movie 3 two minutes to make up that cheezy stuff, but the people from the Ring turned that into a sequel. So basically Scary Movie 3, which parodied The Ring, inspired this sequel. How truly sad. I wish I could get that hour and some odd minutes back, so I could watch a better scary movie. The only good part of The Ring 2 was when they drive along a forest and the animals go nuts. The Ring was great, but The Ring 2 is an unnecessary sequel that should have gone straight to dvd."
3,"Better than ""The Ring"" 1, but I wouldn't buy it","This movie is definitely an improvement after the first part (2002), but I don't think this s the best horror movie that you could buy. Once you see it, you know what's next and you know the story and the ending, so when you watch it again it's just boring. It was perfect in the theatre when you didn't know what would happen, but it's just boring after you know everything.There are actually some fun parts, but it's still not enough. For me, the best scene in the whole movie is the beginning."
2,why is the full screen rated version more expensive?,"Why in all that is just and right is a version of a movie in full screen and r rated is more expensive than the unrated widescreen version?Be careful when you order certain versions of movies! In my haste I ordered the R-Rated Full screen version because in my haste I thought the $20.99 DVD was the ""Special"" version and for $19.49 you get the (in my opinion ) better version.How the @#$%^&&! does that work?Just read carefully before you order."
1,piece of crap!!!,Wow this is horrible! The acting was so bad and it wasn't even scary! Why the freakin' hell did they have to use CGI for the scene with the deer? It looked so godawful and FAKE! The movie altogether was just boring and cliched and the filmakers who made it should be shot! I hate these modern day horror films such as a lousy remake of Dawn of the Dead that barely even had ANY shocking scenes to get Rated R! When it comes to making horror movies Hollywood sucks the big one!! Hollywood stop making these! They suck! Leave good horror to people like Stephen King Clive Barker and George A. Romero! Heck even Rob Zombie makes better horror than this piece of monkey crap! I recommend The Devils Rejects instead of this! It's so much better! Skip this crap! Leave it to Hollywood to screw up the horror category!
1,Uninspired and Cliche Ridden,"I normally don't rate movies this low being a big fan of horror movies. Please just watch the original RINGU films or the American remake 'The Ring' before you waste your time on this piece of crap. The kid who plays Naomi Watts's son in this film is one of the worst actors ever to hit the big screen(and small screen for that matter), unoriginal and uninspired script, not scary at all. Ring 2 is as bad as Darkness and Darkness Falls, a Stupid waste of time."
1,Another bad sequal,"this is one of the worst movies I've seen in five years...worse than Van Helsing.....The acting wa alright, the kid playing the possesed boy, forget his name, put on an ok performance.the writing and directing were bad because, at least for me, it seemed like just a bunch of bad stuff happening to a mother/son with no real development or reason. The most bizzare scene in the movie was when they were being attacked by a pack of elk for absolutely no reason...it reminded me of a Geico comercial....lol which are more creative and entertaining than this flopthe ring 2 is an example of how not to make a sequal....the first one wasnt that great..but the second movie was just aweful...about as bad as Final Destination 2.in short, AVOID IT"
1,If you love comedies you'll love this!,"If I could rate lower...i would.I went to go see this...because i wanted to see if the american version of Ringu could pull through and try to learn from mistakes from the first one...sadly...they just made worst mistakes.I went to the movie to watch this...and could not stop laughing. And the whole audience agreed with me...it was a hillarious film. So if you love to laugh at movies that try desperatly, a little too desperatly, to become a work of art...then i would pick this up.If your expecting to get scared? Well you better be extremlly sensitve to seeing blood..."
1,More like (Bo)ring 2,"This movie was bad...plain and simple. I very much enjoyed the first Ring movie along with the Japanese Ringu, Ring 2 and Ring 0 movies. I wish I could get back the 2 hours I spent in the theater to watch this wretched movie. The story was lame and very slow. I can definitely recommend The Grudge, Ju-On and Infection if you like Japanese horror. Coming Aug 23 is a box set with all the Japanese Ring movies (which I mentioned above).I have seen 3 out of 4 of them (haven't seen Rasen) and they were all good."
1,It can't decide what it wants to be,"I saw the orginal Ring on DVD and the only part of it that creeped me out was when Samara came out of the tv. I had heard that Ring 2 was scarier than the first. Other than one or two jump scenes where Samara appears out of nowhere, there is very little to make this movie worth watching.To me, this movie can't decide if it wants to be a horror movie, a mystery or something else. I don't understand the purpose of the scene with the homicidal deer, other than it makes for an interesting special effect. Before, Samara always came through the TV. Now, she can appear out of nowhere for no particular reason. She can also can use mind control to get people to commit suicide.The end of the movie makes little sense. Naomi Watts goes Samara's world, and when she gets there she changes her mind? And she gets out how? Her method of escape makes little sense. Do what I did and see this movie with a free pass, because if you spend money on it you will be disappointed."
1,Sad,"Everyone involved with this travesty should be ashamed. This adds nothing new to what was presented in the first film; it actually takes away from those concepts that were interesting the first time around. Even worse, it's very boring."
3,Better than most sequels...,"but it's not ""The Ring"". This lacks the creepiness and the fury the first one had. It also lacks the visual flair the first one had. The first one seemed to have a blue/grey tone in it...this one the colors shift and it's uneven. The deer event was kind of scary, but it really didn't fit the story. The bath tub scene was surreal, but it didn't fit either.And Samara sure changes shapes from a little girl to a muscle woman climbing up the well wall. I thought it was that WWF China <sp.> lady.Anyways...Naomi Watts was excellent in a lackluster story. Don't buy it, rent it."
5,The Ring Two,The sequel to The Ring is excellent. I love seeing the cast reprise their roles and the addition of Simon Baker as well.The Ring Two (Unrated Widescreen Edition)
3,not that scary,"This isn't a bad movie per se, and you might want to see it if you like the first (warning: you may like the first movie less after watching this). There is too much CG and a confusing plot. Also, Samara is out of character: in the first movie, she's a demon spawn, in this one, she's a needy child who just wants a mother. I think I'm going to read the books and see what the ""canon sequel"" is like."
4,Big Improvemant From The First One,"yes this movie was definantly a HUGE improvement. From the firt moment when samara ahows up to the very end wouldnt she just wouldnt quit. The Ring Two made the sequel alot better , alot of suspenseful moments. Special effects were 10 times better than the first one. The water effects in the bathroom were superior. I have to admit comming in to see the first at the theatres also i was a little relunctant to pay to see the second one but after seeing it i was most pleased that my wife made me go.....lol...4/5 stars from me"
1,Pathetic waste of time and money.,"This sequel was as boring and idiotic as the first film was genuinely frightening. Perhaps the second installment in this series winds up being so unimpressive because of the caliber of the first film. In any case, I would say that if your ideal horror flick has an obvious plot, depends upon faulty plumbing and electricity for its surprises and scares, has an overly produced and string heavy soundtrack, and includes a completely idiotic sequence with a whole herd of poorly animated, vicious deer which reminds the viewer of a Harford Insurance promo, then this is the flick for you! Otherwise avoid at all costs. Really and truly after watching this movie it made me yearn to throw the director down a well."
2,Snore...............ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ...............,"As we all know the original RING was a remake of a Japanese film...and was pretty good.... (much better than the GRUDGE, which was also a Japanese film converted to USA film, but was lame).RING 2 feels like a Hollywood film thru and thru... or more exactly it feels like a ""made for TV movie""............. slow, plodding and beyond boring.Simply put, RING 2 has big continuity holes and departures from the principles established in the original........... moves at a painfully plodding pace, and has ZERO moments of chills, suspense or anything for that matter.The tell-tale sign Hollywood was behind this movie are the moments of comic relief (Deers attacking the car and the Realtor).... oddly enough I don't think those were MEANT to be humor, but they were.The RING 2 is simply a snore and a bore no matter how you look at it."
1,The Ring 2,"I thought The Ring 2 was not good at all. To me, The Ring was not that great, but I was talked into watching The Ring 2 and I honestly did not want too. After watching it, I truly realized why I did not want to watch. The movie has no good plot to me and is overall a pointless thing to see. This is a movie you do not get anything out of. I would not recommend this movie to anyone!"
2,No goosebumps this time!,"Watching Ring 2 was like hearing a really funny joke told for the second time: you still laugh at the joke but it's humour is somewhat dulled in it's retelling. Ring 2 just flat out fails to deliever the goose-bump-anxiety provoking-cerebral-creepy kind of horror that I loved about the original. Part of this is due to the fact that anyone who saw Ring 1 kind of now knows the basic premise of the Ring and by default- it's not so scary. Also, the producers resort to more of a campy reliance on modern, over the top special effects that fail to carry the movie. Ring 1, like Blair Witch Project and much of Hitchcock's work hit a horror home run by scaring you with anticipation, confusion and what you DON'T see, not so much by showing you the gory details. Rent it if you must satifsy your curiousity about what happens in Ring 2 but it's definitley not worth adding to your library."
2,thank goodness I rented it...,"That way I am only out $3.99. This sequel had nothing to it, you knew what would happen before it happened. No scary moments, and what was up with the deer? Even my 12yo daughter thought it was a lame movie. Save your money, watch The Ring 1, much better and stop there."
4,scary but morbidly funny,"When Sumara was climbing up the well after Rachel calling her ""mommy"" ewww! My husband calls her the ""well witch"" lol and she was double jointed and all wet and slimy and creepy crawly.I enjoyed the movie. It didn't scare me as much as the first, but it was still a lot of fun."
1,Very subpar sequel,"Let me start by saying I did enjoy the first ring, but this one is terrible. The story was completed in the first one. This movie has nothing to add to the first one. The movie is very slow, has a bad story, and is not creepy at all. About 90 minutes of the movie is devoted to ""Plot Developement"" and about 15 minutes is ""Scares."" I did not jump once nor was I ever creeped out. It's sad when the best part of a movie is where people get attacked by cg deer. I saw this movie at a screening with about 12-15 people and no one liked it. The movie does have my favorite line in recent memory ""She was murdered and left to die."" Now that's some quality writing. I would encourage anyone to miss this movie and go watch ""Constantine"" or something."
1,Don't stop the dang car!!!,"This woman seemed like she was trying to kill her kid from the very beginning of the movie. Not only did she send him off to be alone with the creepy ghost girl time and time again, but she'd let him go off by himself at a carnival or whatever where he could have easily been kidnapped. This woman is a horrible mother! And in the dumbest scene in horror movie history, a pack of killer Bambie are attacking the car with the mother and son inside. The son keeps yelling at her not to stop the car but she doesn't seem to get the message. She stops the car over and over again and just lets Bambie slam his horns through his window! What the heck???This movie never should have been made. It's way worse than the first and actually less scary if that's at all possible."
2,compared to the Japanese original...,"Completely off - story changed since in the real movie the mother dies halfway through. This isn't a remake - it's just a made-up ""sequel"" for Americans that aren't intelligent enough to rent the subtitled originals. Not that this is surprising since Ringu was a great movie and the American version was an empty special effect filled attempt. I suggest instead The Grudge which change little. I hope the prequel is remade here: where we see who Sadako really is: a victim. Only because in America she is seen as a monster. I hope the tyin movie ""Spiral"" in left alone."
1,Shrooms? A must have!,The only way this movie is any good is if youre on shrooms or too bored or comatose to care about anything.. I was watching The Ring 2... and halfway through.. im thinking i accidentally put in Lord Of The Rings.. i mean.. this piece of crap NEVER ENDS.. but Lord of the Rings is good.. and this sucks..The ending is retarded.. the deer are fake as hell looking.. and the only cool part is the water effect in the bathroom.. THAT IS IT.. WARNING: DO NOT BUY THIS UNLESS YOU HAVE A RANDOM ASSORTMENT OF DRUGS AND OR A GUN.. CUZ BEFORE ITS OVER.. ULL WANT PUT OUT OF UR MISERY..
1,That sure was a waste of time.,"Whoa, now this is a real stinker. The original was dumb but the sequel is dumber. There are so many things wrong with this movie I can't being to count them. Don't waste your time, watch something, anything else. Halloween, Carrie, the original Haunting all blow this movie away. Even Ghostbusters is scarier. This one is just plain and simple stupid."
2,Not that good...,"The story is that Rachel and her son from the first Ring movie have moved on to a new town to start over. Then, somehow Samara tracks them down and tries to possess the little boy.In a sense, this isn't a bad popcorn movie. I jumped out of my seat in several places. The problem is that they are cheap scares - on second viewing they won't pack any punch. There are a LOT of shots of water that are supposed to be creepy. Then there are some CGI effects that looked fake and not-scary.My biggest problem with most studio horror films these days is that they have incredibly convoluted plots that make no sense. The audience doesn't try to figure things out because they can't, and then some character explains everything and you wonder how she made that wild induction."
2,"Beats the pants off Boogeyman, White Noise, & Darkness.","Naomi Watts is the best thing about this film. The soundtrack contributed well to the mood of the film. The premise is somewhat flimsy; would've been better served to stick with more aspects of the original. The opening sequence for Ring 2 is worthwhile; Simon Baker really had no purpose in the film. Have to give the filmmakers credit for not going for slasher thrills; however, this film didn't scare me. (neither did the original). Hopefully this film will help further Naomi Watts' career. Heck, if you've seen the first, you gotta see the sequel. Do it for Naomi."
2,Dissapointing,"I don't like to give bad reviews to popular sequels, but when I went to the theaters to see this movie, I was expecting a real treat. Kind of an upgrade scare. Not here, sorry but this sequel flops. I don't want to say much, only that it's not what you're expecting. Rent, do not buy this DVD."
4,Sets a record with Naomi's face,"This movie sets the record for so much of a movie consisting of the close-up of one person's face. In this case, it's a good thing, for Naomi is so pretty, and it is Naomi Watts that was having her face in close-ups always on the screen. It's funny, however, but the girl that I saw this movie with in a theater wasn't as impressed with the movie-- or with Naomi Watts-- as I was, for she spent much of her time outside smoking cigarettes. But, I still loved the movie."
2,Eh,"So I absolutely loved the first Ring and still think of it as the only movie to ever really creep me out unlike any before. So, I was really wary of seeing this in the theater seeing that I was terrified of the first Ring. But, since I love Horror film, I decided why not? Well, to begin with, The Ring 2 is not scary, or real creepy or disturbing. Its really sort of unnecessary. The foreboding mood of the first film has dissapeared. Even the creepy little girl in the well isn't as, well, creepy as the first time around. The actual plot of the film is somewhat dumb, for lack of a better word. Its incoherent and boring and unsurprising. So, what I recommend is, watch the first and be prepared for a thrill, and don't bother with this one. Its a waste really. I still chide myself for being so worked up over it, before I even watched it."
3,Could have been great.,"The Ring Two isn't scary and thrilling like the first one. I was disappointed because I love the original so much. This sequel has a different director, which I believe is why this film fails to deliver scares and chills. Naomi Watts is an amazing actress but she looks uninspired in this sequel, you can tell in her eyes what the hell was I thinking? Creepy little girl Samara has no intensity and Adian looks like he has been through the ringer. Simon Baker is nice eye candy but his performance is lackluster. There are some great scenes but the film still feels incomplete and unresolved. Not one to buy, but worth a view."
2,THINGS THAT ARE FRESH GO STALE QUICKLY!,"I thought the ""The Ring"" was pretty good and a fresh idea for the horror genre. The ""The Ring 2"" however, is just OK. We've seen it all before now and it just doesn't do it for me the second time around. It isn't a really bad movie is just isn't really good either. The DVD still looks great, so if your a fan............"
3,"Not Quite Up to Par With the Original, but Worth Seeing","I just got home from seeing ""The Ring Two"" and while it was visually entertaining, it lacked big time in the story department. Samara was barely in the film and the story really just centers around Aiden who is possessed by Samara's ghost. I thought the first Ring film was pretty clever while managing to contain a few creepy parts throughout, sadly this one doesn't compare. To the movies credit, there are three memorable sequences (the deer attack, the water defying gravity in the bathroom, and when Samara climbs up the well in a weird way to get to Rachel). The acting is good from Naomi Watts and David Dorfman as her creepy son, but nothing is learned to develope the two characters any further. I know they will make a ""Ring Three"" after this film makes a killing at the box office, I just hope they think of a much more interesting story to tell next time around."
1,Not scary at all,"trust me, this movie is BORING. this was a major disappointment compared to the original; it just plain old wasn't scary. Figures that the 5-star reviews came from 2 14-year olds."
4,Very inspiring!,"I enjoyed this book. I am most impressed by the people who persevered through it all. To them ""can't"" is the bugle call to charge. This is not a book to read if you are looking for excuses to set in front of the TV and ponder why you can't. It's a blow your excuses out of the water kind of book. I once read that people aren't afraid to fail but that they are afraid to win. We find it hard to live without excuses and accept the consequences of our decisions. These people aren't afraid to win they thrive on it. Winning and loosing is not really about striving with other people, it's about striving with yourself, taking the chance of failure or success. If in your heart you want to be more than a ""Poser"" then join the heroes in this book. It's a very inspiring read.Fred H."
5,Inspiring stories about real people for real readers.,"You have a life to live. Many forces are at work to keep you doing the ordinary. Yet, you may have a vision of some new method, some new product, some new activity, or even grander. What you need to know is that others have broken through the barriers of discouragement, inside oneself and from outside. You can, too. And these stories will fuel you to move forward. The real-life people whose stories are told in this book, remind of you of the inspiration you can get from the characters in an Ayn Rand novel. I bought this for my daughter, Dagny, and I know she'll be empowered now and over the years by this book."
5,Simply Unstoppable,This is a great inspirational book for all the ones who are currently questioning the direction of their lives. Read it!!!
4,Very Inspirational,Anyone who thinks that people who enjoy great success are just lucky or born into it should read this book. It is a beautiful compilation of stories of ordinary people who have overcome extraordinary amounts of adversity to reach success. The author does a nice job of adding action steps and thoughts at the end of the chapters which will help the reader to apply the principles espoused in the book. Definately a worthwhile read.
5,Brilliant. Insightful. Filled with useful information.,"What a gem of a book. Clearly, Cynthia Kersey knows what makes someone ""Unstoppable"". Through her stories and insights, I was given more tools to use so I too could be more unstoppable. This book is a clear winner. Thanks Cynthia...can't wait for the next book!!!"
4,Underrated,"Cynthia kersey's book is just as good as the more well known authors. If you are an avid reader of motivational books this is one you want in your library. Unstoppable has great stories and is definitely one of the best books in its' genre. Eventhough, I believe she could have given a better action plan, the stories are so inspirational that it may drive you into action."
1,Just another goal setting book,"I was really looking forward to getting this book but was disappointed to see that it was only another goal setting book. It was nice to read the success stories but that didn't make enough difference to make the book any more helpful than any other I've read. If you've never read anything about goal setting, this would be a great book. But if you have, don't buy it."
5,A wonderful collection of incredible stories.,"I speak to many groups of people, especially younger audiences. This book has provided me with many valuable illustrations of perservance and courage. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to be inspired or wants to inspire others."
4,REDISCOVER YOURSELF TO BECOME UNSTOPPABLE,"Sure fire access to stories of brilliant minds of today and yesterday. There is no stopping anyone of us to become unstoppable but ""ourselves"". Fact that many of us are guilty of. I had an opportunity to meet Cynthia last spring in LA and she is truly walking her talk. What an inspiring lady she is. This book will give you step-by-step guide to go for the gusto!Jhet Torcelino van RuyvenAuthor, The Tale Of Juliet - You Have The Power to Change Your Life"
3,FLAT,I unfortunately found the stories lifeless. There was no spark or wonder to the characters or surroundings.
1,Very Bad.,"This is a very bad movie. It has horrible voice talents, the animation is bad, and it has a broken up story line that has no point to it. If you want to have an enjoyable movie for your children, get An American Tail, or something else NOT THIS! I'd give this 0 stars if I could. If you get it, you will have wasted your money, Believe me, my 5 year old brother thought it was bad."
4,Still useful,"Despite the book's age, it's still very useful -- San Diego doesn't seem to change that fast! The Tijuana section in particular is quite good. Like every Lonely Planet guide, though, it could have used a bit more editing to rein in the author's particular oddball biases."
5,Kawaaiiii!!! So cute!,"""Inbetween Days"" is a strong filler book for those of us eagerly awaiting the next installment of Blue Monday. Picking up loose bits of story from the previous two collections (""The Kids Are Alright"" and ""Absolute Beginners""), ""Inbetween Days"" fills in Chynna's narratives with the usual foul language, gratuitous violence, pop music references, and a suprising amount of genuine feeling. This is probably the most sensitive of her own work so far - there's a sequence in here (not giving it away!) that rivals the ""how to love"" instruction narrative in ""Hopeless Savages: Ground Zero."" Pick it up while you're anxiously chewing away at your socks for the next collection - this anthology of filler material is wonderful."
5,highly recommended,"This is a great book, with excellent color schemes and pallets, examples, and explanations galore. There are times that I can't find some of the themes I'm looking for, but this book makes it SOOOO easy and wonderful to see great examples of wonderful work in simple genres that so many clients are looking for.I can't give this book rave enough reviews. I would easily rate this book up with the color index book."
5,He's still the man!,"If you love skateboarding, you'll love this video. The long-awaited sequel to ""The End"". Brian Sumner is truly amazing."
4,This is getting better,"There's a great deal to like here, though the unavailability of The French Admiral is annoying. Lewrie is starting to act more like a real person than a sterotype gay blade. The porn is avoidable and completely senseless. One gets the impression that Lambdin (who is at least twice divorced) does not care for the female gender much, as much as he uses them essentially as playthings.The historical stuff is excellent. The series may be distracting, but probably won't come up to the level of Woodman or Forrester unless Lewrie grows up considerably."
3,Not so much history but still a good read.,Have been a Hornblower fan for years. Alan Lewrie is no Hornblower but he can think when he manages to keep his pants on. Don't see that his romps with the ladies adds much to the story of the 18th century British navy.
5,All The Way!,"This memoir was fantastic! The character that Wolff created was incredible because he was so creative and so enthusiastic about all the lies that they seemed to come to life right of the pages! The movie was no where near as good as the book. Without reading the book, one may not enjoy or understand the movie and gain false information. I can only imagine what Wolff's english students are thinking when they are being taught by him. Even I would want to ask him questions about his life, since it is explained in a book. I loved this book and hope that other people can enjoy it as much as I did."
1,The Truth About A Boy's Life,"I didn't like this book for many reasons. One, it was a assigned reading book and most of the books schools assign are boring and dumb, this year being no exception. Actually, they assigned us two good books, After Long Silence & Ender's Game. Other than those, the rest sucked. A Boy's Life wasnt that good either. Why, being in 2001, would ninth graders want to read about a boy in a dysfunctional family back in 1950's? That is a question that I want answered. Boys might find this book appealing but I, as a female, do not."
3,review,"""So absolutely clear and hypnotic..."" according to the New York Times. That is not my point of view at all. The book This Boy's Life is absolutley unclear and hypnotic. While providing an entertaining style of writing, jumping from the past, present, to future is never an approach that i would take. It leads you to jump to conclusions that you would otherwise unthink of. Although one of the strongest traits of this book is how it makes you use your imagination. But some people perfer not use their imaginations. rather to included in the memoir because of it's strong use of showing detail rather then telling. Which do you perfer?This Boy's Life is the story of Tobias Wolff's adventures of growing up in the 1950's. Through his wonderful use of re=creating his experiences, you are not only told what he did, you are there to watch it. This style of writing seems interesting up until he starts moving from past to present. Then the reader is lost and confused."
4,A Flawed Memory,"While This Boy's Life has many of the strengths of The Duke of Deception (its companion piece by brother Arthur), it also suffers from the same flaws. Geoffrey here tells the story of his life with his mother while The Duke of Deception focuses on Arthur and his father. Everything about the family was dysfunctional, and reading about their scams is not elevating nor inspirational. It is satisfying that both boys managed to transcend their heritage, but such wallowing seems more appropriate to Oprah than to true literature. Is this the way Biff and Happy Loman wind up? Sad, sad commentary"
4,Stark portrait of life,"Generally the type of book you'd read as a school assignment. Very period - in 50's, I think. Sad story of life as the child of a single mom who marries someone she thinks would be adequate father, even though she knew he wouldn't be a good husband. Not so! Somewhat happy ending....recommend reading if you love to read well-written stories, but definately a downer!"
1,Endlessly going nowhere,"I wish I had put this book down when I began to realize that it was going nowhere. I just did not get the intent of this boring read. It never did get to anywhere in my opinion. I have read many coming of age stories and memoirs that were far more memorable than this read. Save your money and try Life is so Good, The Invisible Wall or perhaps Breaking Night."
3,Fair Collection,"Well written this is a good book of Tobias' life, his drunkard father and is sure to be ripped of for decades by english teachers who have no real hope of ever being published themselves."
1,This Boy's Life,"I think This Boy's Life writtern by Tobias Wolff was extremly dissapointing and uneventful. I found it boring and struggled to read each page. The book is a recount of Tobias Wolff's life as a child. Growing up in a small town in Utah, he encounters many of life's new experiences. Making friends with one of the losers of the school he eventually ends up fighting him in the smoker, the school boxing club. The issues of depression and misery were unappealing and reading it every night was like a chore rather than a plesure.This book is not suitable for School children as they would not find the book interesting and will probally fail and post tests on the novel."
4,"Slow moving, but has its moments","This book reflects back on the author's life as the son of a single mom. Although Wolff's childhood occurred decades ago, many of his experiences do ring true for kids in the same situation today: the struggles in a single-parent household, the complexities of blending into a new family particularly when mom has ""settled"" for a less-than-worthy spouse due to finanicial stress, alcoholism and abuse in the family, and teenage rebellion.Many individual scenes in the book are compelling and drawn in vivid strokes. I'm not sure I'll ever purge the mental picture of EVERYTHING in the house being painted a stark white in order to spruce it up. Very bizarre.However, this magnifying glass approach to writing is, for me, also one of the book's drawbacks. It moves slowly, and not all scenes are compelling."
5,This boy's Life,This was the more recent version of Catcher and The Rye. Great way to encourage dreaming.
4,The Wolff Strikes,"The great short story king writes his memoir. Tobias Wolff known for his other great short story works proves that he is also an excellent novelist. He gives his experiences of growing up on the West Coast with his mother and abusive stepfather. Wolff, who later becomes a professor at Stanford University, gives us an exciting story full of comedy, intrigue, and sorrow. Toby who is Wolff's autobiographical character encounters many situations, from the fights with his stepfather, to forging his school transcripts and recommendations. These situations mold him into the person he now is. His use of action and dialogue put readers in the story and make his feelings become our own. This is a very good book, which I recommend. Not only is the story excellent, but also relates to our times."
3,Pretty Good,"Scavenging for nits on someone's scalp. That's what I see from this man Dwight as he points out and makes up faults of this young Toby (Jack). Dwight wants to marry Toby's mother. In the meantime, she has him living with Dwight while she makes up her mind as to whether she wants to marry him. Toby, for some reason, lies to her when she asks how it's going (with Dwight). He's treated as a house slave. Nothing more, nothing less."
3,worth the trip,"A great true story (almost) about Mr.Wolffs childhood. Robert DeNiro did an excellent job as the step-Father in this movie. This is typical of a Father figure who has no self esteem and picks at every little thing that goes wrong. It is never his fault always someone else. Toby has a tough time with growing up without a father and being carted around the country by his Mother who has no roots to tie on to. I see a lot of teenage problems in this movie that are played out and done extremely well. Take the time to watch this movie, you will not be sorry."
3,Well written but boring...,"I had to read this book for school, it wouldn't have been my first choice, but out of many I chose it. It was very well written but I had to force myself to read it. It got quite boring in places and just didn't seem to go anywhere. If you like autobiographical type things, you would like this otherwise it's not for you."
5,My Favorite Memoir Ever,"This was first book of Tobias Wolff's I read. And I immediately become a big fan. In fact, he's my favorite writer. I first read TBL out loud with my wife on our honeymoon. Since then I've reread it at least 2 or 3 times--and I rarely reread books [I've also reread TW's In Pharoh's Army]--and bought lots of copies for gifts.This Boy's Life is a poignant, very honest, and self-deprecating look at a challenging childhood. In the long run, it seems what says Wolff is his humor and that he is on to himself. Highly recommended."
4,"Lingers, but Doesn't Explode","I originally purchased this memoir hoping that I could recommend it to my male high school students. There are not a lot of books that appeal to them. I appreciated the writing style very much - his prose is complex and haunting. I think that what the work is lacking is a series of DRAMATIC events. When someone reads a work, they want these huge things to happen. Wolff nicely illuminates how it's the frequent ""little"" things that lead to our real problems. I understood this completely while I was reading it and I felt the narrative was understaed in a dark and interesting way. However, because the plot lacks these big events, I don't know if my high school aged boys will fully embrace it the same way they embrace ""The Basketball Diaries"", for example. That being said, this is better written than ""The Basketball Diaries""."
4,A Timeless Memoir,"""This Boy's Life"" focuses on the pre-college years of a young man, Toby, from a broken, yet interesting, family. All but abandoned by his father, Toby and his semi-heroic mother cross the country searching for a better life. Her tragic penchant for hooking up with seriously flawed men, who act Toby's surrogate fathers, makes the book unpredictable and humorous. By his own admission, the author, who readily acknowledges his own flaws, is testimony to the fact that with a strong spirit and a little luck, one can rise above his circumstances and ultimately make something of himself. Generally, I am a fan of the memoir genre and this is a good one."
4,well written memoir,"This is a well written and engaging memoir. It ends a bit abruptly, leaving me wondering how the author went on to become the distinguished writer he did. I enjoyed this book. The people and places described did become alive to me. While not a page turner, this was a book I enjoyed quite a bit."
2,another sorry mother,"After reading that his mother's family and his bio father were financially well off, none of this makes sense. How did his obviously flaky and unstable mother gain custody? Why didn't she go to her parents? Why would she leave her son in the hands of a strange, unknown man?Where at such a young age did he come up with all this rotten behavior? At 10 and 11 yrs old ('64,'65) we here too busy exploring creeks...., playing ball, constructing forts out of what was at hand, walking the railroad tacks, climbing trees.... Never crossed our minds to hurt anything or anyone. So his vandalism at such a young age is unlikely to me. His desiring a gun weird.This was my second try at reading this book. I found the mothers incompetence too depressing to go on reading."
2,"Interesting in parts, but not well written.","This book had some good parts, but this memoir was not interesting or unusual enough to warrant a published book. In addition, it was not very well written. This happened then this happened then that happened--that's what it read like. There was no feeling; it was hard or impossible to ""get into"" the book and feel what the author felt."
1,May not be good for everyone,"When I rinsed the conditioner out, my wet hair was difficult to comb out. After using this conditioner once, I decided to add oil to it and it works okay. I didn't want to just put it in the trash. That would have been a waste."
3,Does not help hair with dry ends or frizz. Does detangle after shampoo,"Doesn't improve dry ends or reduce frizz. When hair is wet, it does detangle and *feels* like it's smoothing and conditioning, but after I blow dry my hair (on low heat), my ends still look dry and the rest of my hair is little frizzy. I have color treated hair so maybe mine needs a stronger type of conditioner than this one. Maybe this product's ""oil free"" formula is why it doesn't improve my hair. Maybe it will work well for people who need only light conditioning. I couldn't detect a fragrance in this one, which I like."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"I had called and asked some questions in regards to a few ingredients I was wondering about for my daughter, she is severely sensitive to everything, but I couldn't get any straight answers from the lady, and she was SO VERY RUDE!!! She actually told me, ""I hear your baby crying in the back ground, she's saying mommy get off the phone, the lady doesn't want to talk to you anymore"". Excuse me!?? All her products we've tried are irritating to even me, and I have no sensitivities! Don't buy anything from this lady!"
2,Oil-Free Lotion,"I didn't like this lotion at all. I felt like it didn't really do much as far as moisturizing, and it left my skin feeling strange, like it had a residue or something. I don't intend to use it after I finish this hcG diet."
1,Amazon gets it wrong,You provided the product as promised and on time. The reason you get a horrible review is because Amazon is horrible. Thier customer service rots. I ordered items direct from them that reached me weeks past the due date and they won't respond to me requests to return them. I get the same form letter garbage every time I try to contact them. Amazon is crooked. Maybe they'll find time to reply if I keep embarrassing them enough times.
3,No one did this yet? Wow. No love I suppose.,"And I'm not even the one who gives all the love; not for this song at least.It's OK. It grew on Me. It was super-hideous the first time I heard it. The beat, the lyrics and the vocals with that voice distorter made Me nearly suicidal when it would come on.

3,Gorgeous Girls Make Up For Lousy Story!,Liana a pretty jungle girl's parents are murdered by a tribe of about 7 amazons in Golden Temple Amazons. She seeks revenge on them and gradually finds it. The plot of this movie is lousy. The only real reason to watch is for the beautiful women and there are plenty of them! All of the amazons are gorgeous but Liana is the real eye catcher! She & the amazons roam thru the jungle always half nude! Liana is played by Joan Virly. Her short curly hair is lovely to say nothing of her boobies which are just perfect! Liana always wears a g string & loincloth that leaves plenty to the imagination however! This movie is ok for the money as are the others in this dvd collection.
3,Boys' fantasies,"Okay, the idea of beautiful jungle girls in skimpy lion cloths is a puerile fantasy, Tarzan with a sexy twist. But why not indulge your imagination!"
3,Not too impressed,"It's big and heavy and powerful. It's too much of all these for most of my uses. The trigger control for variable speed is poor so if you need a fine touch (such as starting screws with a driver), get something else."
4,comments,"lens abberation is minimal when three lenses are used all together, but it lacks magnification marking on each lense as well as a small loop for attachment with a key holder rather than keeping it in the pocket! The casing should have been metal NOT plastic otherwise price has to be reduced to compensate these cons."
3,Acceptable,The optical characteristics of this item are acceptable given the price. It is unfortunate that there are no markings on the lenses to indicate the magnification power.
4,"Very useful, but could be better made","I am vision impaired and have used this particular magnifier for about 25 years for everyday reading and other tasks. However, I have had about 5 of them because they are so small, I keep losing them. The housing, however is very cheeply made and has a tendancy to break at the point where the magnifier and case join each other. Other than that, it is an extremely useful and functional item, and the clarity is good. The amazon price is the best price I have found. I will say, however, that using this magnifier as much as I do, it would be great if it was found more easily in retail stores, as when you use it as much as I do, it can be quite inconvenient to have to wait for it to be sent. Therefore, I have learned over the years to be sure to keep an extra one on hand."
3,Bausch & Lomb folding pocket Magnfier,"Thought it was smaller then I thought it was going to be, it. was not what I expected the size to be."
2,I wish I could send it back...... So disappointed!,"Now in fairness, and the reason I gave it 2 stars and not 1 star is because there was no false advertising and I apparently screwed up. I didn't do my homework and it's my fault and I guess your opinion of this will depend on what you're using it for.The lenses are alright and the magnification is okay. but they're *so* small. I wish I bought anything else but this. A few years ago I bought a couple of cheap radioshack magnifiers. They were similar to this. The lenses weren't quite as good, but they are *much* bigger. Since then, they've taken some damage and I was looking to replace them. This was not the way to do it! I'm so disappointed! If wasn't for me not paying enough attention when I read the specs on this item I'd give it a 1 star. I'm thinking about re-selling it because I'll likely never use this. If I got $10 dollars for it (40% of what I paid) it would be $10 that would use, unlike this. *so* disappinted!!!"
4,Can Bear dance with the moon?,"I recently rediscovered Asch's books at a library sale and instantly remembered how obsessed I was with his ""Sand Cake"" book after seeing it on (I think) Reading Rainbow when I was little.The story of ""Moondance"" is sweet, and the illustrations are, once again, totally captivating! Bear wants to dance with the Moon, but thinks she is too special to dance with him. But what about the clouds? Or the rain? And could it ever be possible for the moon to find a way to dance with Bear?Bear has a very sweet spirit, and Little Bird is a helpful and supportive friend. I love the various ways Bear gets to dance with the various partners -- quite clever!The ending seemed somewhat lacking to me, but overall still a sweet book."
5,What a Childrens' Book Ought To Be,"Moondance is a simple story that children (mine at least) seem to absorb and enjoy. There is nothing frilly about this book compared to much of what is on the market, but the story embeds a few very positive messages for kids - appreciate what you have, be conscientious, reach out to others - in a way that is thoughtful and resonates with the human experience at all ages. The illustrations are simple but do a great job of telling the story for pre-readers. Moondance has become my 2.5-year-old's favorite book. There is more text in this book than in any of her other favorites, but she has memorized every line. There is definitely an intangible here that has grabbed her attention."
3,Incomprehensible but Good,"Incomprehensible. Harrison's writing is clean and enjoyable, but I only fathomed the first of eight stories. Laden with enigmatic dialogue and mysterious symbolism, I don't believe he meant them to be understood. But that doesn't mean I didn't like them. I did. Supposedly there is a common theme binding them, and I did detect that theme in most, but not all, of the stories. Overall, the book tastes very much like Vandermeer's Ambergris tales. Harrison probably hangs out with Gene Wolfe.Recommended Conditionally. (Condition: You like scratching your head.)"
4,This book lays a pathway for better self-esteem!,"If you struggle with eating issues, whether you are underwieght, overweight, or just sick of feeling bad about your body, this is the book for you. You will feel different about yourself and about food and dieting after working through the exercises. Well worth the money!"
4,Pretty good debut,"Funkadelic (self-titled debut - Bonus tracks) : Some debut records give you all the bands best stuff and then they have nothing left. Other debut records are tests, experiments, a release to see what floats, what works, and what direction the band should take from then on. This debut from Funkadelic is the second kind of debut. This album tests the waters. There are some fine cuts here but not great cuts. It is an enjoyable album, but it only hints at the talent that will be unleashed in their following albums. This CD has seven bonus tracks, doubling the size of the original record. The bonus tracks are recordings from 1969, leading up to this debut. This is more of a Funkadelic early history album than anything else. It gets four stars."
4,"Mommy, What's a Funkadelic?","George Clinton is phenomenal. Great album. There are a few jams that I felt dragged on but overall an excellent piece of work. This is a true funk album. Personal favorites include ""I Got a Thing, You Got a Thing, Everybody's Got a Thing"", ""I Bet You"", ""Good Old Music"", and ""What Is Soul."" If you don't own any Funkadelic albums, this is a perfect place to start. If you already own some Funkadelic records, and you don't have this one, you are missing out."
5,Nothing is good unless u play with it!!,"There is something magical and special about thier debut album. 1969 was the year, and George Clinton and his crew decided to give up the ties and suits and go straight phychedelic or FUNKADELIC. I have always loved this album. My cut on here is ""Mommy? What's A Funkadelic?"" ....."
3,funkadelic edge,this was funkadelic getting started this was the album right before the bootsy collins arrival before the departure of eddie hazel if you own this cd you are definately an underground funkateer
2,Cool noises plus wit does not equal songs,"My problem with this is that most of the tracks don't seem like actual songs to me; to my ears it just sounds like formless funky grooving. Which often sounds pretty trippy, I mean there's cool noises throughout from guitarist Eddie Hazel. But it's too unstructured for my taste. I want songs, and of those I count only two among seven tracks: ""Qualify and Satisfy"" and ""I've Got a Thing..."" For me most of the rest only works as background music, although some of the definitions in ""What Is Soul?"" did make me laugh. I much prefer Maggot Brain.Song by song:A1 Mommy, What's a Funkadelic? *A2 I Bet You *A3 Music for My Mother **A4 I Got a Thing, You Got a Thing, Everybody's Got a Thing ***B1 Good Old Music **B2 Qualify & Satisfy ***B3 What is Soul *"
5,Pure Ancient Spiritual Drumming,Drumming without vocals. Music for the Orishas. Comes with a booklet that tells stories of the Orishas as well as technical info on the drums. Excellent cd for practionishers of African based religions. Also would be of interest to scholars of African culture or music. I loved it.
4,Decent Book for a Beginner,"Not new to motorcycles, but new to Motocross. This book reiterates lots of basic knowledge that can be compiled surfing forums and places it in a nice book."
3,Holly,"Holly is mean, and she is always thinking about social status. Nick is lying to Holly and making her think that he has a low social status.I suppose I could say this was somewhat enjoyable, but I'm hardly able to believe that this is at all realistic. Everything just happened, with no thoughts about what was going on. I'm not sure I am explaining this correctly, but I probably wouldn't reccommend this book."
3,Not great- not terrible,"Holly is your basic love story formula read. Man & woman meet, instant attraction, instant misunderstanding. Then comes the sex and blah blah blah. Ok some parts were intriguing. It wasn't all bad. I even enjoyed reading it. But I'm glad I borrowed it instead of actually spending my money on it. I prefer books with just a tad more substance and sense of reality. And on a last note, Holly had to be the most annoying main character with her whiney, poor little rich girl, snobbish attitude. Yuck! Of course Nick was just as bad, so I suppose in the end they did deserve each other."
4,It was Entertaining,"I loved the ""Forever and Always"" Book and the ""Forever"" book, so of course I was happy that Darci was in this story even with her small part. I love Darci, I can't wait to find out what happen to her husband. What's taking you so long Jude? Any way back to Holly, I like these Montgomerys and these Taggarts. They have interesting lives. And when you have money life it seems is so much fun. Sex, Sex, and more Sex, It was fun. A little corny in some places but a good summer read. I kinda of thought Jude would have sent her Holly back in time just to get the feel of that era but she didn't and the book stilled worked. So read it and enjoy, don't look for too much, it's a book."
3,mixed ratings...,"I loved the book, though by the cover, it looks to be a Christmas romance novel, but as it says on the back flap, ""The answer is unveiled on a starry Christmas night..."", other than that, there is no romance due to Christmas, other than the fact that they had sex on a pile of gold and jewels on Christmas night inside of a cave(with a dead man above them). But, hey, it's a romance novel, and NOT REAL, so the other people who wrote the reviews about them having sex within the first hour of meeting, well, all I can say, FICTION, ROMANTIC, FANTASY!!! I liked it, even though the end was over too quickly and the fact that Lorrie murdered two people just because he got mad at them? Was he a psycho or gay or what? His character could have been developed more. And maybe Holly could have realized how jealous her step sister was? I just think this book was written too fast and I hope there is a sequel that goes into more depth!"
1,Dissapointed,"It's sad I was so looking forwrd to another of Jude Deveraux's story this one let me down.I didn't buy it, thank goodness. I checked it out and returned it in the same day. I didn't finish reading it because it was awful within in the first five chapters they had already had sex and that's what it was sex . There was no emotional involvement between the two. I don't think they even knew each others name."
5,Good,Good. It was in the shape that I expected. I'm pleased with my purchase and will purchase more at a later date.
1,Do NOT believe any good reviews about this book,"Oh PLEASE! A christmas story??? Christmas was in it for about 4 pages. My theory on this... Jude Devereaux (one of my FAVORITE authors) wrote an outline for a story. A pretty good one, acutally. Her publisher called and said ""I have to have a Christmas story"". Put in some gratuitous sex, have something happen on Christmas, and send it in. Sorry, but I don't want to read about some rich gal who wants to marry a man she ""loves"", but jumps into bed with someone else the moment she meets him, and every two pages thereafter. All the while crying how much she wants to marry the other guy. Oh PLEASE. The interesting parts of this story are totally glossed over. That's where I got my ""outline"" theory.I don't believe the people who wrote good reviews. They must be friends of the author. Read ANY other Devereaux story. Her first, the Velvet Promise, remains one of my favorites of all time."
3,Not her best,"I have been a fan of her novels for over 10 years. I think they are usually warm and funny and extremely well written. This book was not. It lingered on sex scenes and rushed through the plot. The usual family element that makes her novels so wonderful, revisiting old characters and just spending time with the Mongomery-Taggert family was missing in this book. Also the major events of the novel happened so quickly taking up a paragraph or two while the sex scenes go on for several pages. Just not what I would expect from a Jude D. novel"
1,Disappointment!,"This must be the worst book Jude Devereaux has written. The characters seemed to be in the wrong time. He should have been dragging around a club. They act like cave people with carnal urges and no morals or self-control. Sex in a mini-cooper and later--on the hood of a car--is not my idea of romance. This is one book I would like to return for a refund. I wonder if Devereaux wrote this book because it is definitely not up to the caliber of others of hers I have read. Do not waste your money, if you want a book with substance."
1,I'm glad I'm not the only one...,"who thought this book was stupid! I've enjoyed thoroughly several of Jude Deveraux's books but this one was awful! I got to the scene after Nick rescued Holly from the ""pit"" and then they start making out and almost threw the book across the room. The waitress thought he ""kidnapped"" Holly because she went down the same road he did? Holly stripped down to her panties in a pit with dead animals in it? She starts making out with a complete stranger because he ""saved her life""? Please. How stupid and contrived. I am not even going to waste time finishing it.Is someone else ghost-writing for Ms. Deveraux now? This book didn't even read like hers. Yuck. Amazon won't let me leave off the stars rating, so I give it one star, but I really want to give it a rating of negative 5 stars."
1,What has happened to Jude?,"First, let me say that I have read almost all of Jude Deveraux's work, and have loved it, especially the Montgomery and Taggert families' stories. However, if Holly is the new standard, I won't be bothering in the future.Several major plot points are glossed over in a paragraph or two, such as Lorrie's actions, which are completely out there, and poorly explained. Character development is adequate for Holly and Nick, but the others are cardboard. And frankly, I thought the sex scenes were awkward. They were more explicit than her usual work and I don't get the feeling that she's comfortable writing that way.In a nutshell, I was disappointed and I think I'll stick with re-reading A Knight in Shining Armor and some of her earlier work."
3,An Okay Read,"Holly is an heiress from a very wealthy family. When she is thirteen years old, she falls in love with Lorrie, a sixteen year old from an old family with declining fortunes. Holly has never forgotten Lorrie. Several years later, Holly manages to convince her father to purchase a mansion close to Lorrie's home. While she's waiting to meet with Lorrie, Holly runs into Nick Taggert. They have a passionate affair but Holly hopes to end it because Nick is not ""marriage material"" for her because, well, she thinks he's just an average working man and not someone suitable for someone like her.To her irritation, Nick takes on a job as her father's gardener to stay close to her, which is fortunate for her because there is a conspiracy brewing to murder Holly for her millions.I enjoyed the story but could not bring myself to like Holly. She is a snob. Even at the end of the story, she's a snob although she tries to redeem herself. I doubt I'll read this one again."
4,Slow to get into it but hard to put down,I thought this book was quite lovely. It was a very romantic tale full of twists and adventure and I couldn't seem to put it down even when my eyes started to water from reading so intently. I have to admit though at first I didn't think it was really all that great but I gave it a chance and it totally redemed itself. I like Jude Deveraux's books because she is able to create a romance unlike any other. Sure a frisky novel is great and this book is frisky at times but personaly I like for there to be more to it then that. I appreciate a author who can create a book that leaves me guessing and this book will do just that.
5,Satisfied,"I am extremely satisfied with the book, it was delivered promptly and without any problems. The book is in perfect condition and i'm happy I could give it to my sister to replace her lost copy. Thanks a lot!"
5,Enjoyed The Story,"I enjoyed this story. The sex scenes were fabulous and hot. Of the Deveraux books I have read, I enjoyed this one as much as Princess. I love the Taggert and Montgomery families, so I always would like more family involvement. This was not Christmas focused, so it can be read at any time."
1,"Sorry, no FIVE stars here.",What was said in these 208 pages may well have been said in FIVE simple pages.
5,Party host's bible,"One of the most fun party books I've ever purchased. Never really used it (bought it as a gift), but the few times I did were great! HIGHLY recommend this book"
5,Great Little Big Book,"Very well thought out, making it easy to find shots alphabetically or according to alcohol in them. There are a wide variety with interesting to funny to downright gross titles. It has all your basic tried and true shots, some that have different names than I remember, and others I just want to try. Sure, you can look these all up on the internet, but it's so handy to just have it right there. Put it on the bar, and you're ready to make anything. The worst thing about this book is you're going to want to buy a lot more alcohol!"
3,decent,"Some of the drinks are definitely wrong, but I'm not sure if that's bc they're talking about shots instead of the full version."
4,Enjoyable,"Nice pictorial views of the bay organized down one coast and up the other.Covers the major marina's , but not the gunk holes."
3,"Brush is great, don't use shovel","The shovel is smaller than pictured and it does not go together the way they show. However, I really brought this for the brush which was well worth the price. I can sweep hot coals back into the fireplace and it does not melt. The hanging hook is really great as well. Get if you need a brush but not if you want a combo set."
1,doesn't site nicely,"doesn't site nicely like in picture, top brush just kind of lays to the side of the first hook like they aren't really meant to go together."
5,Perfect for college students,"I got this, along with the matching toaster for Christmas two years ago, and live in a dorm. I was thinking, what am I going to do with this fabulous waffle iron? I don't have space, let alone money to buy stuff to make waffles, but that's where Bisquick Shake n Pour comes in. Just add water (and if you're like me and my friends in school, mini chocolate chips), and it's easy to make Cinderella waffles! Absolutely brilliant. I adore this thing!"
5,Cinderella waffle iron,This makes great waffles. I got this for my 4 year old daughter and she absolutely loves making waffles. What a fun way to get kids to eat!
2,Not a self contained book!,"I bought this book with the intent of understanding the level set method AND be able to implement it in code. The book fails on the later. He gives you some basic formulas/algorithms to start with, but they are not good enough for most problems. You need to get the references (and the references of those references) to obtain the actual algorithms people use to implement the level set method.The first six chapters are good for giving you a nice qualitative understanding of the method and the issues of implementing the method. And the rest of the book claims to show you the more advanced techniques, but whenever the nitty gritty details are needed, he refers you to the references.My advice: just get his references. If you are at a university, then you probably have free access to the online journals that contain his (and others) research articles. In fact, this book is basically a copy-paste of those articles! Literally!"
4,Good introduction to level set methods,"I use these methods in the context of image analysis, for image segmentation essentially. The book is an inescapable introduction by one of the main inventors of these methods. It is easy to read and relatively complete. Be sure to get the second edition. The only slight problems are the remaining typos. There are quite a few, for a second edition, and they might throw off a beginner. You will need to read some introduction text on finite differences methods at least. The chapter in Numerical Recipes is enough."
3,Not for beginners,I am afraid that this book is not for beginners who want to have a clear mind of the level set method. You will have to go to the library quite often to dig out all the references the author mentioned. I would say this book is for experienced researchers only.
5,This is an all time family favorite dating back thirty years,"Buck out did himeself with this album. Definately his best work. I grew up listening to this album every Christmas. The best song is ""Daddy looked alot like santa"" It's up beat and fun to sing and dance to."
4,joyus melodies that stick in your head until next xmas.,"I first heard this album,worn and scratchy, as a youth. Now with children of my own I can still be-bop along with them to the tunes of Santa Looked Alot Like Daddy and Christmas Times'a Comin. It often bothered me to spend so many years without this album at christmas time. Perhaps it's just the powerful resurgance of fond memories that set me in search of this album or mabey the timeless talents of Buck Owens himself. Either way, I found it all over again and you can too if you spend...Christmas with Buck Owens."
5,CHRISTMAS WITH BUCK OWENS,THIS WAS ONE OF THE BEST BUCK OWENS CD S I HAVE EVER HEARD. I ALWAYS LIKE TO ORDER MY CD S FROM AMAZON BECAUSE I GET THE BEST QUALITY CD WITH THE BEST SOUND. THANKS SO MUCH.
1,Avoid this piece of trash,"If you should happen to stumble on this piece of pulp fiction in a second-hand bookstore, give it a miss. It is boring and unrealistic. The author obviously has little knowledge about what really happens during earthquakes. There are much better earthquake novels out there such as ""The Big One"" by Kevin Ready and ""Richter 10"" by Arthur C. Clarke and Mike McQuay."
1,"Earthquake, the movie, based on this.",Word has it that the movie Earthquake was based on this book. It never got credit but I have it on good authority that this is true.
2,didn't work well for me,"I tried this after years of using the schick intuition. I figured 4 blades, better shave... I was wrong. The razors worked OKAY for my legs, but HORRIBLE for armpits. It would leave hairs everytime... I would switch directions and go over and over. Finally had to resort to just using razor on legs and using a Venus on the armpits. Final answer, no I would not recommend or buy again."
3,It's a blade.,"Good, but for the price should be better. The wire strips that are supposed to help prevent nicking skin, just get clogged up with hair, making it impossible to clean out. The blades do last for a reasonable amount of time. Schick Quattro For Women Ultra Smooth Cartridges is way better (no wire strips.)"
3,Razor refills,Haven't had to use the refills. I have been using the blade that came with the razor and will probably not have to refill for another week.
2,Schick Quattro & Quattro motto,"I used the Women Quattro to shave my (blank) area and I cut myself to pieces. I ended up buying a (blank) load of bandages.Schick Quattro Midnight Razor, 1 Razor"
5,It does the job.,"The razors leave a clean shave on my skin. I have been using this product a many years, and would continue to use it for many more years to come."
2,Not the closest shave,"I bought these razor refills because I have the Schick Trimstyle (a great trimmer!) and I like the idea of having a razor and trimmer in one. However, the razor doesn't give a close shave on my legs. I have to go over the same area again and again, and it still doesn't feel smooth! This means it takes me a lot longer to shave. I don't use shaving cream, but I get a great shave with the Venus Embrace without shaving cream, and in a lot less time. The Schick Quattro razor is very non-irritating and I never cut myself, and it does seem slightly better than the Venus Embrace on underarms in terms of irritation and getting stray hairs, but that does not make up for the dismal job it does on my legs. I really wanted to like this razor since Venus Embrace is twice the price and I have to keep a separate razor and trimmer, but it just doesn't work well enough. I wish I could exchange this product for Venus Embrace refills."
3,Doesn't work well on legs,"I bought this razor and blades because I couldn't find my usual (and loved) Venus Embrace blades and had heard good things about these blades so figured hey, couldn't hurt to try, well it didn't hurt, but these blades give my legs a lousy shave, I had to go over my legs a good 3 times and I STILL had stubble because of the stupid wire strips across the blades, yes I know they're there to prevent razor cuts. Good news I didn't cut myself and I didn't have razor burn after all that hassle. They did do a good job on my arm pits too. The blades do have a pretty long lifespan too, which is another plus for the price.The razor itself, I like the control and the way the razor head moves better then my Venus, it's much smaller and more flexible, but that doesn't help any if the blades themself suck, which they do.Definitely not worth it."
5,"As described, arrived promptly","My order was correct, as described, and came quickly. I would definitely use this vendor again. I ordered with the auto renew so it was several dollars cheaper and I won't have to remember to order again when I run out."
3,***BEWARE***Not for use on your face!!!,"I have a problem with my wife always stealing my razor and using it on her legs and other areas and then putting it back. Severe tire damage ensues. I thought I'd get her back by using her girl razor. WRONG WRONG WRONG!!! ABORT ABORT ABORT!!! Never use your wife's razor, especially if she is just this side of sasquatch. She must eat up five of these things per shower!!! You can get the bleeding under control with the help of a trauma unit, though. That's the good news."
1,You are being scammed by this industry!,I used to have a woman's schick quattro razor. I can tell you that it is absolutely a piece of junk! It dulls four times faster than a man's razor of the same model. If you enjoy working harder for more money to buy junky things and to fill our land fills this is for you. I recomend just learning to hoan and get a good straight razor . It will last literally 100 years and take up less land fill space when it finally wears out.
3,Mica : her fourth album is ok,"Mica is a UK soulqueen who has to be taken seriously. She is still there, she is still touring and she is also a wonderful classical singer (what she is doing at the moment). This is her fourth album and she is trying to ""move on"" with her sound. She has a great voice and is a great artist, but this album doesn't contain any real hits."
2,Since you asked,"I wasn't going to say anything but since you asked:1. I didn't order the map. I was directed to the page for 1 day shipping (which I didn't need),saw the shipping charges (It was about $20 for map and shipping) and backed out of the page.2. It's a map for Gods sake, not a Faberge egg! a few days later I arrived home to find a 12""x12""x8"" box from you that contained 3 air pillows and a map that could have been sent in an envelope. FYI there's a lot of bitching from greenies about your over consumption of packaging material.3. I don't know what a good mexican map looks like, but people who do told me this one was not very good.Sincerely, bd"
5,Great product for a very good price,"I bought this projector in exchange for Epson PowerLite S3. S3 has excellent reviews and very low price, so I wanted to try it first. Very good projector, but two things are missing - optical zoom and high resolution. 76C is just like S3, but it does have optical zoom and 1024by768 resolution. Image quality is great. Images are also very bright, enough to see during daytime in a well lit room (but may not be bright enough for direct sun light). Design is great and operation is very easy. Menu options are actually very intuitive and logical - something that is not common with many other projects. Overall - great product, definitely worth the price."
4,Nice projector,"Of all the LCD projectors this one gives the most bang for the buck, and I definitely would rather have the slight screen door effect than the rainbow effect on the DLP type. The only complaint I have so far, after a week of use, is that the fan on high speed, needed here due to the altitude, is much louder than I would have expected. I can run the projector in the low light mode, but the 7,500' altitude requires high speed fan operation. No one ever cited that in reviews."
3,IT Manager,Does not focus well. Not a widescreen projector. In fact left and right margins cuts off a little (Start button displays ont 'art'). Would not have purchased if I was able to try before you buy.But it is very light weight and has a built in small speaker for quick presentations without setting up external speakers.
2,Size of boxes,This is my gripe about most sudoku books the size of the boxes makes it difficult to put readable notes in boxes. How can one judge the quality of the puzzle when the error is due to an unreadable note?
5,Clearly the Best and a lot of Fun,"The Nikoli Sudoku books are simply the best. The easy ones are easy, and the difficult ones are much harder. You can pick what suits your mood. As a previous reviewer said, sometimes it seems that the easy are not clearly easier. As I considered it, I think it has some to do with the puzzle solving techniques one uses. If you are working on the harder puzzles, you use a different set of techniques. When you get to the easier ones, you have to shift gears and use a different set.And as the cover text says, these puzzles may be difficult, but not frustrating.With lot of other Sudoku puzzles, it is hard to tell the difference between the easy and the hard, and none are too challenging.These are head and shoulders above the other Sudoku books I have used--from easy to difficult--and a lot of fun."
3,Quiche of death,"The book was entertaining, light and easy read. Enjoyed reading it, some parts were very funny. I love books about quirky English characters."
5,Cheesehead,This is the first M.C. Beaton novel I have read and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was light and entertaining reading. I am looking forward to reading the next Agatha Raisin mystery.
4,Quiche of Death,This author is very good at tongue in cheek. Her plots though not the most complicated still keep one interested to the end. I like the setting in England. The personality of the main character is very funny.It is a book I would recommend and an author to be read again.
4,the beginning of my agatha addiction,This is the one that got me addicted to Agatha Raisin and I haven't missed once since!
4,Off to a good start,"I like most of the Agatha Raisin books, but they are very uneven. Be sure to try her Hamish Macbeth series too."
3,Quiche of death,"This is great , light escapism . After reading the Hunger Games Trilogy I needed some just pure fun escapism. Quiche of Death fills the bill if you are a mystery addict. If you enter cooking contests, this is a must. ( :"
3,light reading,"This was a pleasant diversion, not particularly deep. Enjoyed it but not enough to seek out other books by this author. Seemed a bit shallow although for a time I was starting to like the direction the main character was going."
2,Boring,"I've never read an Agatha Raisin book before, and now I know why. She is not a very likable character and the book is boring. I'm halfway through and nothing has happened. I can't bring myself to finish it."
3,The major player was irritating,"Story was OKay, it kept my interest, but I would not rave about it or even recommend it to my friends. I really enjoy the Hamish MacBeth series M.C. Beaton writes, so was disappointed in this one."
2,"Eh, not great",I haven't even finished the book because its a bit boring. The characters never really developed into anything interesting and the storyline isn't a page-turner.
4,DELIGHTFUL,"Wasn't sure how this book would work for me, I was delighted. It was intriguing and funny at the same time. That's a new one for me. I love my detective stories and they are usually not funny. I would recommend this to those who like dectective stories because this one will give you a chuckle as you wait for the answers to come."
4,TheQuiche of Death,I enjoy the way Agatha little lies get her into trouble. She uses her sly way of thinking to help her get out of being thought of as a murder and makes herself a town celebrity.
4,Garden gnomes and all.....,"I came to this after reading lots of M. C. Beaton's Hamish MacBeth mysteries. This one has the same local color--in this case mellower on the surface because the Cotswolds don't have quite the same dourly forbidding quality at the Scottish highlands--and the same wonderfully eccentric supporting characters. Agatha Raisin is a complex character, not easy to like, but probably ultimately hard not to love, as she starts to blend in with the people of Carsley. (The Agatha who lies on her kitchen floor throwing balls of tin foil to her kitten would be unrecognizable to the tough-cookie Agatha of London public relations fame!)As with most of the Hamish books, the fun here isn't in who did the murder but in how Agatha figures it out."
5,Hilarious but Tense,"This first book in the Agatha Raisin series just proves once again that MC Beaton can write. I love the character of Agatha Raisin and can see my middle=aged friends in her. I'm beginning on the rest of the series and finding them enjoyable as well. Don't expect a female Hamish MacBeth, Agatha stands alone."
4,Agatha still the tops,This is the first of Agatha's adventures and still the one that I can bring to mind and enjoy a chuckle. I often go back an re-read it. Highly recommended for curling up with in front of a fire on a wintry day.
3,Tons of Extreme Typos,"I am currently reading this book on my Kindle. (I am about 1/3 of the way through the book.) This Kindle version has many, many typos and some of them are absurd. For instance, this book's main character is Agatha Raisin. In at least three places, she is called Angela. I just read a paragraph where another of the characters was called by yet another of the character's names. There are also many less obvious typos like ""teh"" for ""the"", or ""at at.""The name mixups are distracting. I like the story, but the ""translation"" is ridiculous. When you pay for a book, you do not expect so many very bad errors. I do not know who is responsible for the errors. If it is the publisher, they need to get their act together."
2,Something to consider...,"The key to being able to enjoy (or attempt to enjoy) this fairly quick read will be your ability to stomach the main character, Agatha Raisin. Agatha is an arrogant, self-centered, manipulative b**ch -- with a few relapses into decent behavior. By the end, her character arc leads to a kinder softer Agatha. However, in the second book, she defaults back to her acerbic manner. On the plus side, this book helped me realize that an important ingredient to a mystery I will enjoy is a likable protagonist."
3,One time,The story wasn't bad but I don't think I'll read more of the series. It was a bit slow and repetitive. Though I neved guessed who the murder was.
4,The Quiche of Death,"My first read in the series. A very kooky, eccentric character with a few soft edges peeking out. I will continue with the other books in the series."
4,Agatha Forever!,"I have read some of this series out of order. I discovered this, the first book, only after having read 2 others. Doesn't really matter. I loved Agatha from the first novel I read. She is so human--actually she reminds herself very much of me, LOL! She is definitely not the beautiful, sweet heroine of so many novels. (Thank goodness!) My sister and I exchange and discuss the Agatha books. We howl with laughter at some of her bull-in-the-china-shop antics.I read some pretty negative comments about Agatha's personality quirks here. I guess you just have to have a certain outlook on life to really appreciate Agatha. And I now want to live in the Cotswolds, too.I am experiencing one problem. At this point there are so many A.R. books around that I am having trouble reading them in order. Amazon has a link to a list which purports to be the whole series in order, but it is not, not, not. Some books are not listed, many are out of order, etc. I wondered if anyone has an accurate list??"
5,Golly...,"Blush - I've been a reader of Michael Connelly, Robert B. Parker, Joseph Heywood, and Robert Crais. In short, he-man stuff. The kind of book that you can depend will end with a shoot-out. I'm extremely grateful for having discovered the Agatha Raisin books. Obviously not because they end with a hail of lead, but because she is just an outstanding writer, and Agatha is a wonderful character. I only wish P.G. Wodehouse were alive to enjoy the series - he'd have loved it."
2,Misleading Cover,"As a student focusing on Islam, I expected this book to address the conflict between Islamic fundamentalism and democracy throughout the book; after all, the title states, ""Terrorism's Challenge to Democracy."" In truth, Barber includes only one chapter on Islam. Additionally, he uses the word ""jihad"" as a blanket term to describe all world-wide struggles to maintain traditional culture in the face of the overwhelming American capitalist machine. He uses this term to make a point, but he also succeeds in confusing readers as to what it actually means and stands for. No, jihad does not necessarily mean rebellion against capitalism, nor does Islam advocate such a thing. In the end, uninformed readers might come away with incorrect ideas about Islam, seeing as it's barely addressed in the entire book."
3,"good, but...","It was a good book. It brings to light the idea that a free market does not equal democracy. However, the book was too long in some parts and too short in others."
1,Lesson of this book: He's smarter than you are.,"My first thought upon reading this book was: What is this guy thinking? I was assigned this book for a college government class and it is was the biggest waste of time ever. The guy writes like he owns stock in Webster's dictionaries because you can't read it without one. He uses the most scholarly words and complex phrases possible in every situation. You have to read some parts twice even if it is a simple point. The author (Dr. Barber) came to give a lecture on his book at my university and he actually read an embellished version of the introduction to the book for an hour in most boring monotone imaginable. I wish he would have just kicked me in the head and saved me some time. Sadly, this book only sells because of 9/11, it's as simple as that. Anyways, buy it if you REALLY REALLY want to know about the subject (even though some of his ideas are totally worthless) or if you are some sort of masochist."
1,McWorld? More like McMoron,"This work is hardly groundbreaking theory. Even for 1995. The fact that Barber can argue that McWorld (basically capitalism) is detrimental to democracy is ridiculous. Also, Jihad hates McWorld, not because of its global market economy but because of who we are. Jihad hates America because we are a ""Christian"" nation. Read the Qur'an."
5,For School,"I had to read this for an international course that I was taking. This book was an easy read and hard to put down. I really enjoyed the development of ideas and how it was presented. At first I thought it would be a book that was going to bash Islam however the turned out to be everything but. I read this title a few years ago and I have had the time to review it again. But if my memory serves me, it was a good book that I am glad that I had to read."
3,"Good ideas, mediocre execution","Barber's book should be lauded for its many thought-provoking ideas. With the downplay of ideology and national borders in the 21st century, the forces Barber labels as ""McWorld"" and ""Jihad"" are certainly coming to the forefront in world politics, and this books provides a good introduction to them. However, Barber is overwhelmingly alarmist in his predictions and too often claims rhetorical victory after providing a hollow argument. Read this book to educate yourself on the concepts of Jihad and McWorld--to see what they are and how they might contribute to global development in the 21st century. But take everything Barber says with a grain of salt, for while his arguments are long on rhetorical flourish, they are short on vigorous, factual reasoning."
2,"Too irritating to read, but yes I did","If you can slog through the pompous and grossly over-written prose, you will find: more or less just another leftish tract chock full of whining and alarmist generalities. The book gets two stars rather than one simply because it is so well researched. Unfortunately, the analysis is weak and repetitive. It is also self serving. You can almost hear Barber rubbing his hands together when he comes out with terms like ""infotainment telesector,"" hoping to have created a legacy with this newly coined jargon. What was most annoying was his ... capitalizing on Sept 11, by reissuing a book which in reality has little to do with the underlying issues. Better off with Huntington."
2,A point please!,"Barber's got an interesting topic here, but he doesn't seem to go anywhere with it. He doesn't give any statistics, facts, or anecdotes to explore the yin and yang of globalism and the Third World. Instead he seems to go on and on without adding to the subject. The preface to the post-9/11 printing is interesting, but the rest of the book is somewhat dated."
2,Writes like an associate professor who's up for tenure,"I found this guy's writing style exceptionally annoying. He seems to have made a conscious effort to choose the most abstruse, pompous phrasing possible, even when describing the simplest of concepts. This book reads a bit like something Frasier and Niles Crane would write: full of themselves, striving at every opportunity to sound erudite while coming acros to many as pompous, arrogant, and somewhat out of touch.Some of his analyses are also a bit of a stretch. In many cases, he'll use some obscure reference to, say, Milton or Keats or explain the motivations of a Palestinian suicide bomber or a Balkan nationalist. This to me seems rather silly. Whatever the motivations of a Palestinian suicide bomber, they're more likely to be explained by such concepts as religous fanaticism, economic desperation, and political alienation than by some eggheaded reference to Paradise Lost."
1,"Author is big on ""Democracy""","The author does not seem to understand that America is suppposed to be a 'republic' not a 'democracy'.Democracy is rule by the mob (often an ignorant one)A republic is rule by law, where everyone's individual rights, are protected.Hopefully, one day, the author will review the excellent video at:[...]"
1,"Unfortunately... a shrill, confused rant","If you think this book will be something along the lines of Huntington's ""Clash of Civilizations"", think again. Barber makes scant mention of militant Islam or any other motivation for terror, and does little to discuss or propose practical remedies. Instead, he blathers on about ""Declarations of Inter-dependence"", ""Global Justice"", ""Democracy versus Capitalism"", world government, and every other warmed over pot of anti-globalizing porridge that you can imagine. Within the first twenty pages of the book he is morally equating terrorists with currency speculators, and that theme remains throughout. His hatred for freedom and his ignorance of basic economics are palpable, and both are well expressed in his frequent and verbose attacks on ridiculous straw men. The only Jihad on show here is Barber's zealous neo-Marxism."
1,McGarbage,"To think a tree died for this book! What a waste and please don't waste your time. Barber's point, assuming he has one, is lost in his attemp to be flip and witty. He could have summed up his thesis in a paragraph but then he wouldn't have a book to sell. Two forwards and an afterword? He should change his name to McVerbose. If you can read buy another book and if you can't read you don't need this one."
5,Very informative,Very good and informative. Well written and documented. Would definitely recomend. I can't seem to think of anything else to mention - it is just good.
3,WARNING WARNING WARNING!,"This book is helpful in many ways, but DO NOT use his numbers for the amount of food to store per person, unless you are feeding a professional football player in training. He mixed up the USDA recommmended amounts for the average family of 2.3 people, and used that figure for one person.. WE actually figured it out, and you would have to eat something like 10,000 calories per day to eat those amounts. Look at it carefully. How many people use 10 gallons of oil per person per year?"
2,More food prep oriented than emergency,"This book has some useful information but it doesn't fit the bill as an emergency book because much of it includes things like recipes which you cook in an 350 degree oven - which you may not have in a true emergency. Also, there are a lot of charts that look good but really don't help that much. 9 pages on the use of honey seems a bit much too. Resource section lists lots of resources but closer examination shows that many aren't geared to individuals or only carry one item for emergency use."
3,"Comprehensive, yet complicated.","At first glance, this book looked like a great comprehensive source for information. After reading through the first two chapters, I had spent hours, and was struggling to weed through all of the information. It is a good preparedness encyclopedia, but if you plan to use this as a workbook, hopefully you have a high tolerance for boredom, and many hours to sift through the detail."
4,Making The Best Of Basics,"""This is a great book for the hard core survivalist, or in aiding average persons, to survive in an emergancy. Nuclear, Biological, Chemical, or even Terrorist attacks or Invasion. Clear and easy to read instructions from water purification, shelter construction, weapons; even gathering food.Check it out!"""
1,This is a rehash of Red Cross information,Nice job in taking away credit from the Red Cross. Are you donating any funds to them for this book?
2,MAYBE I'LL HAVE TIME AT Y3K,"i WAS HOPING THAT I WOULD HAVE TIME TO READ THIS IN MORE DETAIL WHEN THE Y2K BUG WAS SUPPOSSED TO BITE. Since it didn't ,I have not had the time to get deeper into this book. I like it though and maybe when the children are grown I will try some of those recipes for bread.The storage info. is neat. I always wondered how the old-timers did that stuff !"
1,A great book...,"...for 100%-pure bigots. If you want to reinforce your prejudices, your Coulterian demons, this book is for you. If your friends are tired of your quoting Coulter, now you can impress them with quotes from this pseudo-intellectual Timmerman. Countless assertions are made in this hackjob which the author makes no attempt to substantiate, but which are clearly designed to increase your level of hatred against people you don't understand.Read this book, memorize the hooks, and go back to your favorite rightwing chatroom, where you can impress your bigoted pals with your newly found pseudo-knowledge.By a bigot, for bigots. Wish I had thought of this grand way to make a pile of bucks.(I didn't buy the book, and I'm glad I didn't)"
1,Filling neo con agenda or how to fabricate a second Iraq,"Shame on you mr.timmerman, shame on you, its a tapestry of incoherence ranging from half truth to blatant lies...remember those iraqi weapons of mass destruction..."
5,A must read,"This book is very important to read. The situation with Iran will come to a head in 2006. Don't be spouting partisan propaganda (both Right and Left), get a hold of the facts.It is very serious. We are talking about nuclear weapons in the hands of religious extremists. That is unacceptable."
5,Very Important Book,"I found this work very compelling and extremely well documented. The reviewer below that gave it a one start rating for having a ""neo con"" bias obviously read it predisposed negatively. Iran's been attacking the US for decades. It would be out of character if they weren't planning something more devastating than bombing Marine or Air Force housing. Just today the Europeans, on a fool's errand, finally broke off talks with Iran. Current events may render this book obsolete within a few months. Read it fast."
1,Appealing to Simpletons,This book was loaned to me by a customer of my shop . I read a little over a third of it before having had enough . That there are people in America who assign any validity to this trash is the scariest of prospects for the future of world peace .Fear mongering and propagation of hatred are all I got from what little I read of this . Facts ( a very lberal use of that term ) are distorted or ignored in order to bolster the author's thesis . This is proof that the world is full of stupid people .
2,Not the best,"I much prefer Cafe Pilon or Cafe Bustelo to this coffee. Both have a richer flavor and are finer ground. I decided to give this a try because it was on Amazon Prime, but will switch back to one of the others after I finish using up this batch."
2,Bad Coffee,"I bought three times this coffee, and always taste different. I believe they don't maintain the same blend. I think is really bad coffee quality and cheap. don't buy it"
5,superior coffee for the price,"This espresso coffee is exceptional for taste, convenience of packaging and well worth every penny! The perfect cup or three to brighten your day, any day!!"
3,"Not espresso, not the best carribean coffee","I had tried just about all Puerto Rican and Cuban espresso coffee brands and this one lacks the strong full flavor of any of the PR or Cuban coffees. This is not espresso coffee, it is corse made for drip coffee makers,prepare that way is better. It is dark roast and made this way is not bad if you use a drip coffee maker. But caribe can't be compare to Bustelo or Pilon which you can get here at Amazon at a great price (sometimes) and are great espresso coffees. The best Cuban coffee for espresso that you can get here is the Pilon Gourmet or the regular Pilon, try them you won't be sorry."
3,Caribe - OK,"Not bad coffee, I like strong coffee. Just seems to have a little bitter edge to it. May mix with a lighter blend to even it out."
3,IT'S JUST NOT MY CUP,"Needless to say I drink alot of coffee butthis Cafe Caribe espresso coffee is truly not one of my favorites at all.Not to keen on the taste whether made in Espresso pot or french press.Could it be that since I am not Latino, and lack the Latino taste(as item description states???)that this coffee did not suit me? I doubt it!To make things worse, Amazon could not seem to be able to fulfill this order correctly. They kept sending me 1- 10 oz brick instead of 6 listed, not just once but 3 times....I was refunded half of my order cost.Good thing these were not gifts for Christmas!On a positive note: All 3 of the Amazon CSRs I spoke with were very helpful & polite.Be cautious when ordering this item.Curious to see if others have experienced this same issue."
4,"fine, cheap espresso","This is an excellent dark roast at a great price. In my opinion, the grind is too course for espresso. My remedy is to open the package and pour about half of it into a blender, and hit the ""grind"" button. Dump, and then grind the second half. This improves the aroma and flavor. Clearly, I'm fussy about my espresso."
1,NOT an espresso,"This is a coarse ground coffee, more suitable for regular American coffee makers and not espresso machines. The taste is okay, but very little crema forms on top. Disappointed."
2,Save a few pennies but--yikes!,"I usually buy a slightly more expensive coffee--thought I'd save a few pennies--how bad could it be, right? This is a little like licking the bottom of a public ashtray. Okay, not quite that bad, but I'd much prefer the cheapest canned coffee at Walmart. Cheap beans, weakly roasted."
5,Great for races!,bought one for myself and loved it so much I bought 2 more as presents. it is great for races. hold my goos and i do not have to worry about pinning my race number on myself. perfect for triathlons when you are worried about having a quick transition time. love this product.
2,Seriously Flawed,"I purchased theFuelBelt Gel Ready Race Number Beltabout a year ago in order to carry gel packs with me during longer training runs and races. It had the added benefit of being able to hold my bib number so I wouldn't have to stick pins through my jackets.Almost immediately, I noticed the belt would not stay in one spot. It constantly spun around my waist no matter how I loaded the gel packs. The problem persisted with bib number attached.After a few uses, the elastic on the belt started to lose it's elasticity and after a little over a year of use, is on the verge of being unusable even with the belt fully cinched.The only thing keeping this product from one-star territory is that it does secure my gel packs without fear of falling out.This is my second equally disappointing product from FuelBelt (FuelBelt Sahara 22-Ounce Palm Holder with Pocket) and until they improve their quality control, I will not be purchasing any more FuelBelt products."
4,Good,"I am new to the triathlon arena. I bought this with the idea it would hold my numbers. It works so much better than pinning the numbers on my nice clothes. I have not used it to keep gel packs, but the stretchy nature and buckle clip seem like one could keep them in place."
5,Worked for me.,I bought this a week before a recent marathon. I did run with it once before the race. I found it held my PowerBar gel packs securely. I won't use the tabs that hold the race number. I prefer to pin my number to my shirt. When I ran with the belt with no shirt this last weekend it did scratch me. I used to put 8 gel packs in a baggie and do my long runs carrying that. I will use the gel belt from now on.
4,great!,"i really like this belt, as it holds several gels and is adjustable. It does ride up a bit, similar to the fuel belt, but i think that has more to do with the way my body is than the belt itself. i have pinned the belt to my shorts and it stays right where i want it, so i've made it work perfectly for me"
2,Not worth the storage space.,"I thought this would help me on a recent triathlon, but when it arrived I was disappointed. The gel holders make it easy to rip your gels just trying to load them, and the squeeze-clips for the race number are very weak. I gave an extra star for the price- admittedly I got what I paid for."
4,Important reading for any New Englander,"I have lifted whole lecture topics from this book, and passed on copies to numerous students and friends. The idea is lovely -write an ecology based on an intimate history of one square mile of land-and Mitchell delivers it up in excellent prose that keeps one reading even when the material turns a tad dry. Why only 4 stars? I am not sure if this book will have ""legs"" beyond the landscape and history that it celebrates. It would be great to have a few more Mitchells do something similar to the westward and southward, so that we could expand our perceptions beyond the deliberate confines that the author has set. For those of us within a day's drive however, this is definitely a book to read."
4,how to get to know a place....,"....is what the author shows you throughout this highly readable tale of Scratch Flat, a mile-square locale near Concord. The history of its geography, botany, and inhabitants unfolds here in lucid prose devoid of technical jargon. For the ecopsychology course I'm putting together I plan to make this book required reading.A recommendation: the word ""primitive"" ought to be removed from future editions when used in reference to American Indians. Many regard it as derogatory, and even white readers may well wonder who is more primitive: those who inhabit the land with care or those who kill its inhabitants and ""develop"" it out of existence."
1,Read the reviews,I made the mistake of buying blind.... never again! My main problem wasn't really with creating the movie (which is still difficult) but more with the menus. The title pages to select from are terrible. First impression of a movie is from the menu. Not happy at all. Today I'm reading reviews to find another program.
1,Save yourself a lot of frustration - get MEP 11 instead!,I am an avid user of Movie Edit Pro 11 and thought 12 would be even better. I couldn't have been more wrong! The video preview screen is very jumpy and choppy. That alone I could have dealt with. I went as far as exporting part of a video I had been working on and it came out the same way. So now the program is pretty much useless to me. I've talked to other people and they've had the same problems as I'm having. I have XP Home and tried installing the software on my other computers which are running XP Pro and ME and got the same results. I am beyond disappointed in this product and it's too bad because it had a lot of potential if not for that one major problem.
4,Great Card Table,It is strong and well made. It works well as a game or dinning table for up to six people. It is easy to fold up and store.
2,Not worth the money,"My husband loved the look and workmanship of this messenger bag but we ended up returning it due to a serious size issue. We liked the nylon material for all weather durability and although the dimensions were exactly as described, the main zippered compartment does not run the length of the bag and cannot fit a letter sized folder without serious bending and twisting. This messenger bag looks good but is not really functional. You will need to go at least the next size up for it to work. Also, the straps were uncomfortable to wear for any length of time. In our opinion, this messenger bag is not worth the money. We ended up purchasing a Coach messenger bag that cost a lot more but was worth it."
1,NOT FOR SHORT BEDS,Pay attention to what you select. This is NOT meant for a short bed not matter what it says.
4,"Good collection, but missing his best work","I have all of Patrick Cowley's records on vinyl. What this collection is missing is the real version of ""Menergy"",Cowley's best work. This album has a somewhat tired version featuring Sylvester on lead,not the original Patrick Cowley Singers. (I love most of Sylvester's work)Also,this CD does not contain the original versions of ""Thank God for Music"" or ""Come on I wanna to take you home"". They were re-done on this album for some reason and are not quite as good as the originals. While I admire Cowley's work, I would not say he was an innovative musical genius,like some do. Most of his music is a direct riff of Giorgio Moroder's ""From Here to Eternity"" (1977) and ""E=MC2"" (1979). However, it still does capture a certain period in club music of the early eighties and I still would recommend it.BTW, it does have 2 orginal Paul Parker songs ""Right on Target"" and ""Pushin' too hard""."
2,Not great,I got this because my toddler loves lift-the-flap books but this one is just not very good and one of his least-read books. There are many better books on the market to help kids prepare for the birth of a sibling.
3,What's Inside,"I write to warn parents that this book includes an image that can be disturbing to young children. One of the images is a teddy bear and when the flap is opened, the author shows a teddy bear ripped open with its stuffing pulled out and its eyes in disarray. The second time my 17-month old saw this image, he said, ""No! No!"" I am not sure why the author chose to literally disembowel one of most childrens' most cherished possessions, but it can really upset little ones. I ended up covering up the image with a photocopy of the intact teddy bear and writing that there is ""lots of love"" inside the bear."
1,Software is horrible,"This software requires you uninstall your current version of windows media player install the Math Advantage software with an old version of Windows Media Player. This information came from the support forum after doing a search to help my problemAfter I initially installed the program I tried to run one of the applications, I received an MPlayer2 error. This software is marked 2007, it should be able to run with more recent Media players"
2,inconsistent,"I agree that this is just hodge-podge of unrelated programs. Some are much better than others. I did not have the installation issues mentioned by others. It even runs on NT. The biggest nuisance is the quality of the math program. It has bugs and is very, very poor quality instruction. My goodness, if your student struggles with math, poor instruction is the last thing he needs! The vocab and grammar programs are cute. A good review for a 6th grader, not higher. The foreign language program is basically flashcards. Good review, but zero instruction. I picked it up for my kids to use over the summer for something to do to and as a review. They are both middle school students. They found the math very confusing and the rest pretty easy. I got it at a discounted price. Probably worth it. NOT worth the list price (hence only 2 stars)."
1,If I could give this product negative stars I would,"I agree with the other reviews. I purchased this product outside of Amazon but came here later to see what others thought about AFTER I ran into a host of issues. The applications are outdated, riddled with bugs and support for the application is lackluster. The packaging advertises quizzes and tests to track progress but there is only one sample quiz of one question per section and no way to track my child's progress. A BIG Let down.STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!!! You'd do better letting your child sit in front of the TV watching public television. They'd get about the same out of it and its free."
1,Worst program I have ever purchased,Great packaging. Ridiculously bad content.I'm a techie and this is the single worst educational program I have ever purchased. This is a hodgepodge of programs they must have purchased from others. The tech is extremely old andprovides no guidance or instruction. Several of the programs don't work on XP. There are postings in users forums indicating that several people have the same problem but no answers. My guess is that most of these programs (at least the one that worked) are from the 1980's. Avoid at all costs. What a letdown compared to the packaging!
5,Speechless.,I love it!! I thought I could only listen to it once or twice. But it has never left my CD player. The Inside notes are excellent on this CD. This is one of John Cage's best works!! Highly recomended to the Curious. Every fan of John Cage or classical music must own this CD!!!
3,OK,"This is my second purchase of these re-usables. The first was problematic .. the case was dirty and beat up. It worked after some trial and error so I found the purchase acceptable, especially considering the excellent pricing. Haven't tried the second yet, but I expect no real problems. The OEM cartridges are super expensive so these are worth the try."
3,"good writing style, bad guidance","The book uses a clear writing style. It is simple, concise and important things are highlighted. What I disliked very much is 1) the fact that I was mislead by the program examples. There are two editions of the book and also I bought the book in fall 1998 I got a outdated edition. The hyperlinks in this outdated edition link to the material and the examples of the current 2nd edition. I lost a lot of time until I found out about this. 2) There is no help on how to install a Java Development Environment and most important where to place the classes on which the example code in the book depends. So you need eather an other book about this facts or someone to help you installing all the tools you need in your computer."
5,"Excellent- Simple, clear, and concise","I was surprised at all of the negative feedback this book has gotten. I am a professional programmer, and was thrown into Java by a company software need. Among the Java books I had at my disposal, I found Java Gently to be the one that made the concepts the most clear in a concise manner. I found myself constantly referring to Java Gently to grasp different Java concepts, switching then to more advanced books to obtain a more detailed perspective. I believe this is an excellent book for beginner Java programmers that wants to get their feet wet in Java. I am looking forward to a new edition that incorporates the new JFC classes."
3,I guess it was all right,"This book was used in one of my freshman classes as an introduction to Java programming. The book was fairly easy to understand and did a decent job of explaining things.I think my biggest complaint is the use of the javagently text class. The way the book is written made the reader/user too dependent on it, and at a loss for what to do if/when the class wasn't present.While using JavaGently I found myself frequenting the API's at java.sun.com. I have since used it for reference, but the lack of detail on material covered by the javagently text class has had a negative impact on this book."
1,There are so many better books - skip this one,"This book was the recommended text for a Java Programming class at the University of Maryland, University College. In addition to being a student I have also been a programmer for the last 6 years. This is one of the worst programming books, Java or otherwise, that I've ever read. Two weeks into the course, this book hit the trash can and I purchased a different book from which to learn Java from. Even our instructor apologized for the University's poor choice in class text."
3,Java Not So Gently,"This book was required reading for my graduate-level foundation Java class. Having no previous experience in object-oriented programming, I was reassured by the title that Java Gently would ease me into the programming world. While the road wasn't as ""gentle"" as I had hoped, the book does provide readers with practical examples for implementing Java 2 and explains how concepts used in introductory programs can be applied to more complex ones. Although Java Gently is an introductory book, it would be more useful for someone who has programming experience in another language. Perhaps then the learning curve would be a bit more ""gentle."""
2,This book is really hard to follow up on,"This book was really hard to follow up on. Although it had some easy to understand definition, the examples provided were really hard to follow. I didn't learn to much from this book. I had to move on to another book just to get a clear understanding of definitions and concepts in java programming."
2,Not a good book for beginning programmers!,"I am so sorry that I chose this book for my CS 1 course! I wish I could start the semester over. At first glance this looked like a reasonable book but by Chapter 3 I knew we were in trouble. Bishop introduces material too quickly, too compactly, and too abstractly. Her examples are huge and cumbersome. My kids are really confused and probably annoyed -- Here's another stupid college textbook that makes us feel like nincompoops! The title is *QUITE* misleading; this is *NOT* a gentle introduction to Java or programming principles. By the way, there's a cultural barrier, too, that North American students will find hard to hurdle. Just check out the ""1 man went to mow"" song on p. 68 to find out what I mean."
1,look somewhere else,"I have recently being appointed to teach Java and Object oriented programming to a class in my Institute. Upon poor advice from one of my colleagues, i recommended this book to my class. However i have found it to be a totally frustrating experience using this book as a class text. It is structured very poorly and the author seems to jump all over the place. she introduces complex examples early on the book without any proper explanation of the underlying concepts. She leaves the proper discussion of objects too late in the book and the object and class design methodologies are unclear and poorly explained. an awful book i have now switched to another book by Morelli called Java Java Java which is structured much more cleverly."
2,Summary of the Reviews so far,"If you take a look at the reviews so far, you will see one common denominator: those who have little programming experience are greatly frustrated with this book. But programmers who need to learn a new language, seem to think that it is quite OK. I would have to place myself in the first category. I read the first couple of chapters as part of a university course, but soon abandoned the book. The learning curve is way too steep for beginners. The progression of themes bears witness of limited pedagogical insight. But I still believe that folks with plenty of programming experience may enjoy this book. I give it two stars, though, primarily because of the inappropriate title. This is NOT a 'gentle' introduction to Java. Maybe the third edition has improved in this respect (published December 2000)?"
2,Not very strong,"I like the look of this magnetic clasp, but they aren't strong enough. I've had customers complain about the magnets pulling apart way too easily. So they are beautiful, but not terribly useful."
5,"Brilliant, insightful, beautiful","Years ago, my father met Arlene Williams and that is why I was introduced to her book around the age of 11.. I adored these fairy tales and read them for years, to this day I still have very fond memories of these beautiful stories with wonderful morals. Today, as I look for books for my children, anything Arlene Williams writes will be on the list - she is truly a gifted writer producing glorious messages for children and adults alike."
5,A Personal Message from the BSB!,"""Anywhere For you"" is the sweetest song and it is really nice in Spanish too. I especially like the special message to their fans ""Happy Valentine."" They tell what they like in their valentines. I definitely recommend it."
4,Good book for all pipe smokers,"Very Interesting book for those of us who collect and smoke pipes, I always manage to learn something new about pipesmoking and pipe trivia."
1,"Delays, delays, delays...","I'm sure that this upgrade will be one of high magnitude, however the production and development for this product is not. The first upgrade was posted to be out a month ago and they decided that we would want the full expansion pack at one time. Personally I would have enjoyed being entertained by the first upgrade while I waited for the larger expansion. Now they have delayed the release yet again. I'm sorry but this is not how you run a successful company. When you set a release date you had better make it even if this means overtime for the crew. To delay causes desertion in the buying population and not as many people will buy now than before. Also I do concur that they need to keep the original game separate from the expansion. Thanks."
1,This is the lamest game ever,"At first I was impressed with this sorry excuse for a game, but after playing it for a week, I win every time when I play against the computer. But really what is the worst is that the AI of the game [stink]. It just is worthless. So in a...attempt to make it more challenging, it cheats. You ever charge 3 heavy calvary with 60 of your heavy calvary only to be beaten because the 3 heavy calvary you attacked just happened to have their daimyo? Come on, how stupid is that? There are a million bugs the game uses to get an advantage, which is a real shame, because the frustration it builds just does not make the game worth it. It is also a joy to get your troops stuck on the side of a mountain and it is just impossible to manuerver them anymore. Never has a game had such potential just to [stink]."
3,Info You Could Use,"This is not a review, but a response to the first entry: Dude, don't worry, you can buy the expansion exclusively if you already own Shogun. It will be available from Electronic Arts the same day the full release is set to come out. And it will be priced significantly lower than the full release."
1,Shogun - Total Rip Off Edition,"I Love the orignial Shogun, but this is too much. My poor unsuspecting wife bought me this for my birthday and what did we get? This is hardly an upgrade over the original - a couple of new unit types and a silly mongol campaign FOR THE FULL PRICE OF THE ORIGINAL GAME???. Where is the upgrade to the diplomatic room - instead it's gone and we're left with unfulfilling text. Where is the upgrade to support single user castle sieges? Instead there are just some corny castles dotted around the scenery without purpose or use. How about enhanced graphical renditions of the units? How about an enhanced story line? This is just the same old game repackaged to rip you off. For shame."
5,One amazing game,"This game is a must get. For many reasons. One, it's got so much to do that you'll be playing for weeks before you really finish the game completely. The storyline is also quite interesting as you make and break alliances with neighbouring clans. The graphics in this game are quite impressive as are the sound affects. I like the over map idea because it shows the way real battles and wars are fought. The battles are truly the best battles I have seen in a game of this type. The true scale of war is highly impressive as thousands of soldiers engage each other in combat. The one gripe that I have about this game is the system requirements. You have to have a pretty good computer to be able to play the game without the slow down. But besides that, the game is truly one not to be missed. Buy it."
1,Dont Buy this Garbage,"You've spent hours building a massive army...You've finally forced the A.I. into a descisive battle...Your calavry is set to out flank the enemy Archers...Your spearmen are set to take the charge of the enemy horsemen..Your bowmen have taken the high ground, ready to rain death on your foe...Crash.....This game is RIDDLED with random crashes. Go to fight a battle..crash..go to save a game..crash..go to load a game..crash..Even after patching it, it crashes more often then the stock market.Dont buy it. It makes me a little unsure of buying Medevial total war if they left this product so under supported."
5,best game ever,Amazing game with realistic variables that make it compelx but learnable lots of fun amazing graphics best game of its kind and in some ways the only game of its kind
4,Very good battle simulations,The non battle strategy play received mediocre reviews at best (I haven't even bothered to play it yet) - but the battles and campaigns are very good.Running down rows of unsuspecting archers or musketeers from behind with Cavalry is good- and the new Thunder Bombers are devastating if you can get them on a hill shooting down.The strategy and terrain effects are very good. Some problems with a few quirks and the AI could be better - but overall an excellent game.
3,Annoyed,"Obviously I haven't played the expansion yet. I just want to let EA know that I'm more than a bit upset that they're bundling the original game with the expansion and charging us Shogun fans full price. I love the original, but I'm offended by them trying to make me buy it twice."
4,A slasher in the woods harum-scarum,"I'll keep it brief. 4 stars for slasher fans (like me), 1 or 2 for regular, normal people.The grungy-looking slasher guy here lives in a cave, waiting for some ""doe meat"", (young busty girl is his favorite flavor). He preys on backpackers and that's who he gets in this one.I liked the locations a lot and the cinematography, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of three. It's not the most imaginitive plot I've ever come across. I liked ""Sleepaway Camp"" much better.It's no ""Friday the 13th"" either, but for slasher fans, it's sure worth watching. I've watched it several times myself."
5,Sweet!,Don't use these is you live above someone in an apartment! Super duper loud! But they're great to practice in the winter!
4,Decent introduction,My Son attended UPS and graduated the year this book was published. It is a decent review of the College from his point of view although he rates campus food lower and off campus options better. He discovered that off campus housing is difficult for males to get given landlords bias. He thought the academics were great for a Science major and would have put at the top of the best things list the financial aide Finacial aide for good students and Profs willingness to help. As a parent I was pleased that Dean's meeting with parents during Frosh orientation warning that entrance scholarships were likely to be it. His Sr. year cost after Aide was a fraction of instate cost. Good book about a fine college.
3,A little disappointed with this one,"This game is almost exactly like Roller Coaster Tycoon except the graphics are bizarre, and it is very hard to figure out what things are. I have all the Sim games and love them, but I was a little disappointed with this one."
4,Great Game,some older kids might not like it but if ur like 10 or younger this is a perfect game for you
1,no manual and no fun,"bought this, and come not in the originality pack of it, so it depends on who you buy from i guess, because the one i got the case is not the original case and broke, eventhough it said new, anyway, the password just come in the piece of paper rather than original casing in the back of it, very dissapointed the way they handle it, not pro, and after you got it, takes along time before it open, i guess because i have older version computer, than they said read manual, which i couldn't find it anywhere, so that's almost the story of it, besides it totally not like roller coaster it just like cartoon, not real."
3,sim coaster,I bought this game and it didn't work just like sim theme park. They have to update these two games so that they will work on XP. I was very disapointed. Buy it tough if yo have 95 or 98 but not if you have XP.
3,Sim Coaster or Sim Theme Park Expansion Pack?,"I enjoy sim-games. I have all of them. From the original Sim City to the latest, Sim Coaster, I got 'em. I just have to tell you, I was not very impressed by Sim Coaster. If you take Sim Theme Park, add in some different rides and have the whole thing require more micromanagement input from you, then you have this game. The graphics are the same caliber and the rides have been given a facelift, but basically it's a whole lot like Sim Theme Park.Granted, I'm the type of person who really likes Roller Coaster Tycoon (RCT). I like the detailed abilities RCT gives you like building underground, inside buildings...etc. Sim Coaster doesn't give you these abilities. It's more of a park- management type sim than a park-building sim.Sim Coaster isn't a bad game, it's colorful and has decent graphics. If you don't have Sim Theme Park, it might be worth a look. If you do have Sim Theme Park, that same look will bring on a strong sense of deja vu."
3,Works fine for me,"I have Windows XP and this game works fine. However, the graphics engine is still sort of slow and slightly jerky, even if you have a good graphics card and a 2-ghz processor. If you like making theme parks, then I would get it. This is not, however, what I would consider to be a good roller coaster building game. In that sense, the name is very misleading. The coasters aren't that realistic and riding them only makes you feel bad about your hardware, no matter how good it really is. If you're looking for something to build coasters and have an enjoyable ride, I would suggest Ultimate Ride or Hyper Rails. Hyper Rails is pretty complicated, though, compared to Ultimate Ride, but Hyper Rails is more involved with the theme park aspect while giving more coaster options. Ultimate Ride has a few theme park type options, like ""props,"" but you can't shape the environment as much."
2,Very dissapointing,"The name is very decieving. The game had very little to do with building coasters. It uses the same system as Sim Theme Park which was an awful game. I thought that this game would be more similar to Roller coaster tycoon which in my opinion was the best game of 2000 or 1999 whenever it was that ot came out. If you liked Sim Theme Park you would like this game, but if you want it for the coaster aspect of the game then forget it."
3,I have no clue... So I'll just put up three stars..,"I've never tried this game, never even heard of all these new fansy things, SimCity, SimThemePark, or whatever. The only game I have is ""The Sims"", which is, I'm guessing, one of the greatest games ever made. It's cool, but what does a roller coaster have to do with ""The Sims""? I thought that ""The Sims"", was making families, making houses, and living for them, but riding a roller coaster? Ok... This makes absolutely NO sense to me whatsoever. Why would you want to even ride a roller coaster. Excuse me, it might be a great game, it's just... ""The Sims"" is one of the greatest ever games, and I don't think people should ruin it by trying to ""fansy it up"" or something... sheesh.."
2,New? Really?,"I purchased Dexter: Seasons 1-4 DVDs (described as ""new"") because I don't subscribe to Showtime, heard good things about the Dexter series and wanted to check it out. Although the series is interesting and fun to watch, the DVDs that I purchased are of low quality, skipping and breaking up in many sections. Obviously, this ruins the enjoyment of watching the show.Athough the Amazon price to purchase the DVDs is lower than if you bought them at a retail store, caveat emptor..you get what you pay for."
5,Great Show,This is a great show. Amazing actors and actresses. Great story too.The only down side is that the DVDs had trouble playing on my PS3. It had a few smudges and I cleaned them and it still wouldn't play. I tried on my neighbors son's portable DVD player and it allowed me to watch the first episode. I just believe I got a bad DVD. It happens. :) I returned it and got my money back.
4,Dexter!,"I bought DEXTER seasons 1 through 4, and they were Awesome! The only complaint I have is that two or three of the episodes were internally damaged in a way that I wasn't able to watch them.... Other than that, I love DEXTER!"
3,"Great show, poor DVD quality.","The show itself is fascinating, but the DVDs are of quite poor quality. The picture continually pixillates, which is annoying and distracting. The sound is average at best. Probably the poorest quality DVDs I have ever purchased."
5,Be prepared to be entranced,Great product and great series. The fourth series is just showing now on satelite in the UK.Am looking forward to viewing the whole four series one after the other.
5,Dexter,"The best ever, I love the dvd's and will recommend this sight to all of my friends. Great Price and product, Thanks a Million!"
1,Bundles are supposed to be cheaper then buying separate seasons!,"When offering bundle seasons, the costs are typically lower then what it costs to buy them individually. This is not the case with this product. Go buy them separate and save some money. Don't give in to the machine, fight it."
2,A great series but the blu-ray set isnt worth the price,i got this thinking i would get alot of bonus features but there were none to be found. the series is great but i wish i had just gotten the DVD set instead of wasting all my cash.
2,cheaper to buy a different way,"It's cheaper to buy seasons 1-3 together, and then season 4 seperate, It's about $25 cheaper!"
5,dexter seasons 1 thru 4,the series was awsome who would have thougt up such a plot?????????? the charectors are great looking forword to seasn 5 the villians were perfect john lithgow jimmy smits were awsome as bad guys
4,"Sure, it's derivative but what superstar hasn't borrowed from him/herself","""Deja Vu,"" the first single from Beyonce's ""B'Day"", does bear a striking similarity to her 2003 monster smash ""Crazy in Love"" but that should be no surprise to any follower of popular music. Most artists ""repeat"" themselves because fans expect to hear the same with little variation.""Deja Vu"" also benefits from a killer video that showcases the singer's vocal skills along with her highly appealing body.The remixes here are typical house workings featuring the standard amplified bass lines, the re-dubbed vocals, extended instrumental riffs, and constant repetition of the aforementioned.Track Listing:1) Featuring Jay-Z Album Version - 4:002) Featuring Jay-Z (Freemason's Radio Mix) - 3:153) Freeman's Club Mix (NO RAP) - 8:054) Maurice's Nusoul Mix - 6:015) Maurice's Nusoul Mixshow Mix - 5:58"
2,Deja Out,"Sometimes, when a artist samples others, it can be a good song turned into a better song. However, when a artist samples themself, it just a song into something either good, or absolutely hammy. When Prince sampled his song 1999 for his single Fury from 3121, he turned a good song, into a better song. For Beyonce' and Jay-Z it just absolutely meant the opposite direction. Deja Vu, the first single from her upcoming record B-day, seems more like a cheater than a different song. The chorus samples the bridge to her first solo hit Crazy In Love. That song had a bit of appeal, but this one however misses the appeal completely. I don't like it as much because the feeling isn't there. I think she needs to find something different next time to bring out her style. This doesn't have the sensation you've felt before.Song: D"
5,Chuck-a-Duck Devil Rubber Ducky Launcher Toy,"I bought this as a stocking stuffer for my husband. He and my son have had a lot of fun with this toy. I only wish I had bought two! So far we haven't had any problems with durability. The only issue we've had is losing the little ducks behind furniture, but they are fairly easy to find."
2,lasted 1 hr.,I got this as a stocking stuffer for my 6yr. old son. It was fun for about an hour and then the gun broke.So much for that!
5,"Publishers Weekly, objective review?","I have not read this book yet, but I have read some of Professor Johnson's other books (Darwin on Trial, Reason in the Balance, and The Wedge of Truth) in addition to many of his essays available online, and based on my familiarity with his writings I predict that the Publishers Weekly reviewer has not accurately represented this book. From the reviewers tone, I surmise that s/he is a Darwinian and that this book presents a major challenge to her/his worldview. I have followed the Intelligent Design/Darwinism debate closely, and it's the Darwinists that are most guilty of ""pretentious-and repetitive-arrogance."""
1,Tilt!,"As one earlier reviewer of this book has pointed out, ""Any set of assumptions that always yields one conclusion needs to be questioned.""Now, if we could just get Phillip E. Johnson, Esq., to apply that rule to the fundamentalist Evangelical Christian Creationism he espouses...Unfortunately, he most emphatically does not do that in this latest of his books, all of which have the same mantra: ""God did it all, so further investigation is pointless."""
1,Publishers Weekly said it all.,"From the Publishers Weekly review shown above:""...Johnson's work suffers from serious flaws and is particularly marred by its insensitive and defensive tone. He inaccurately characterizes his opponents.... He also takes cheap shots, even as he claims to be resisting the temptation. He admits that he is also tempted to self-centeredness, and the whole book has the whiff of a pretentious-and repetitive-arrogance.""This just about says it all."
1,Peeing into the wind . . . .,"Evolution is supported by mountains and mountains of documented, irrefutable evidence from educated, professional, intelligent people who have simply followed the course of where their research took them. It's no longer about one guy who wrote one book in the mid-1800's. Not any more. Inform yourselves, people. I challenge anyone reading this to actually investigate how much supporting research there is out there for evolution in science, in astronomy, biology geology and physics. It's overwhelming. Check out some web sites from some universities and research institutes to get an idea of how research is being done on evolution all over the world. Do you think they're all in a conspiracy, and that they're just making it all up?"
5,good for elementary ESL class,"This book is good for a lesson on prepositions.For the same purpose, I would also recommend ""Bears in the Night"" by Stan and Jan Berenstain and ""Rosie's Walk"" by Pat Hutchins."
5,Would do business with this seller again,"The book I purchased was not in the condition stated on the site. I emailed the seller, who immediately, no questions asked, refunded my money and apologized for the inconvenience. I will continue to do business with this seller!"
5,Familiar...The Original and Still The BEST!,"I loved this book. Familiar is the smartest cat detective on the scene and I always enjoy reading about his adventures. This book was thoroughly inventive and original. For the record, the original Fear Familiar book came out in March of 1990, BEFORE Sneaky Pie Brown and Midnight Louie arrived on the scene. I think only Lillian Jackson Braun's cats beat him on the scene, and hers don't get into the cat's head the way the Familiar books do. Familiar was a groundbreaker, especially in romance, and this book is a good example why. Compelling characters and loads of humor and suspense. I feel this series is far superior to the others, proving that the original version is usually the best. People accusing authors of ripping off other authors should know what they're talking about before doing so."
2,So-so,"Decently written and dealing with topics (adoption, abuse, etc.) of concern. But an obvious take-off of the Midnight Louie, Sneaky Pie, and Joe Gray feline sleuth mysteries. If you like this series, go on to the others - you may not be back."
1,Avoid this poor transfer,"There are some good things and great bargains on the Regis label; this is not one of them. It has been transferred from LPs which are faulty. The sound is afflicted by wow which makes it fade in and out disconcertingly; nor are peaking and distortion mitigated. I replaced mine with the excellent new remastering on ""Decca Heritage Masters""Der Rosenkavalier: Heritage Masters(see my review) or you could equally buy the Naxos issue.This is of course a superb, classic recording, truly authentic; it deserves a good transfer."
2,Leash does not last long,"I generally like how this product works, but after having it for only 3 months, the leash broke with everyday use on my 60 lb. Siberian husky. I operate a rescue and walk my ten dogs daily. I like to walk at least 3 at a time, and have to have a heavy duty leash and unfortunately, this one did not fit the bill. They are too pricey for my non-profit rescue to afford to purchase often. Sadly, I cannot now return it."
2,Works great but coming apart.,Purchased this in August 2011 for our 105 lb. golden. Has worked very well but in past month the blue reel housinghas begun to separate at the seam; can actually see into the housing.Am concerned as I don't want this to come apart while walking our pet near a street.
3,Weak plot can't overcome otherwise interesting erotica!,"If it wasn't for Monique & Julie's girl-girl encounter toward the end of this film I'd have rated this one a single star, but that one scene upgrades it a couple of notches! Julie Strain makes a great dominatrix! I just wish she and Monique could have done more together! Their chemistry is HOT!"
1,keep it a secret,"terrible movie,plot,scenes. Most of the movie shot in the dark while its raining. Full of bondage,whips,leathers, and none of it goes anywhere. The only decent scene in the whole movie only lasts about 3 minutes, and surrounded by nothing worthwhile."
1,horrible boring movie,"the graphic is blurry and fuzzy. The plot is extremely stupid and hard to understand what's going on and don't know what's the point of the movie. Little actions, and the music is terrible. The good lesbian theme at the end(last less than 2 minutes) is captured in a dark rainy day and the graphic is really horrible, unable to show the details. I won't recommend to anyone, i bought it and watched it, and has to fastfoward several parts. After i viewed it i have the intention to throw it away!"
1,Garbage,From the cover and description you think you are getting a sexy hot movie. Believe me this is not the case.It is a slow drawn out nothing movie with little to offer. I am glad I got rid of it.
2,Junk,"I have no real clue what this movie is about, but Julie Strain & Monique Parent in the rain *almost* make up for it."
5,Awsome Punk...BUY THIS,"This CD rocks hard. Law is great, Nuclear Saturday KICKS ***!!! Face to Face also has a great live song, plus a old classic. If one shread of your being is a punk fan, BUY THIS NOW."
5,Great Compilation,"The best $ ever spent on a C.D., this C.D. has everything you could want. I listen to almost every track on the disk, and absolutely love it. I especially enjoyed the songs by Blink 182 and the Hippos, these bands will be huge."
2,Not that good.,"this really isn't that good of a CD. The good songs are by no motiv,far,gotohells,nuclear saturday,and down by law. Everything else is garbage. The only other good song is by face to face('resignation'). The blink-182 songs are so bad,it's funny. Their cover of Billy idol's ""dancing with myself"" is so incredibly bad,it's actually blasphemous!"
5,I love trhis movie,this is a great movie a lot of action and its full of mystery and you never know what is going to happen I would recommend this to anyone who likes a lot of action
4,Mostly Pleased,"Received the item very quickly. I know it was titled not being in mint condition, but the figure wouldn't even stand up straight in its stand. After applying heat to the legs to remold them, I finally got it to stand up. However, I would do business with this person again."
5,Great Book,This is a fantastic book with great illustrations. My 5 yr old thinks it is the funniest!
5,Diary of a wombat,"I loved this book from an adult that has had the wonderful fortune to have cared,raised & released three of these unusual creatures of the Australian bush.Jacki French describes so accurately the most important things that Australian wombats loves to do-Sleep,eat and to check out whats new in their backyard including humans. The illustrations are wonderful and the destruction of all things foreign is so typical of this creature and their love of carrots, sweet potato and a bowl of oats are like chocolate is to us.I recommend this book to children and adults alike as it is entertaining and a great introduction to the world of the Australian wombat. If this small book makes you smile then follow it up with 'How to scratch a wombat' and read about Jacki's experiences, living amongst and raising these animals in the Australian bush."
4,Interesting historical novel.,Interesting historical novel about an orphan boy who sneaks into Windsor Palace to see Queen Victoria. Prime Minister Disraeli is depicted using the incident to motivate the queen politically. This was adapted to a film starring Irene Dunne as Victoria and Alec Guinness as Disraeli.
4,sexy shoes,"I love these shoes for special occasions. They are really different. I have worn them about 5 times so the feathers are still in good shape. I like the pewter color because it goes with black and brown. They should probably be saved for ""dress up"" occasions due to delicate nature of the feathers."
4,Very scary and fun to play,"I can only think of one other game that scared me and that was the classic Phantasmagoria. The sound effects and foreboding atmosphere of this game make it fun to play. It is more than a shooter, in that it provides a creepy story. Some people do not like the linear play, but this is an adventure game and a horror story all in one, so I welcome the style. I have beaten this game once, but I intend to play again tonight (play this at night with all the lights off).The reason I gave it only four stars is that initially the sound quality was very choppy or in some places non-existant, even though my sound card (Sound Blaster 128) satisfied all the requirements (it was DirectSound / DirectX 8.0 compatible and tested fine). I bought a newer Sound Blaster Live and it works fine, so your sound may be faulty even if you meet their requirements.All in all, a great game."
4,Get this- you won't regret it!,"A very scary game. If you ever thought about surround sound, then buy it too. I heard thumps and screams coming from every speaker! I found myself being attacked as I was trying to figure out where all the spooky sounds were coming from!"
5,OMIGOD,"I got this game the day it came out and omigod is it awsome. i have had it for awhile, so i have already beat it, but even though ive beat i can still play it over and over again because this game does not get boring. Everything is superb about this game. There is nothing wrong with it. THE GRAPHICS ARE AMAZING, AND THE GAMEPLAY IS EVEN BETTER. I command u to GET THIS GAMEit's better than half life and deus ex"
5,"There is only word for this game, ""AWESOME.""","I purchased this game last night and haven't quit playing yet.The graphics are perfect. The sounds are perfect. The game is perfect.However, if you are using a 32mb graphics card, you are missing out. I would suggest spending the money on the 64mb card. It ROCKS.I play on a pentiumlll, 800mhz with a 64mb graphics card and haven't had any problems with slow loading times or anything.It's all in your computer babyyyyyy.THIS GAME ROCKS."
1,Hmm...er....,"First off I would like to congratulate EA for making a SUPERB trailer for Undying, hell, I was caught off guard, I began my immediate purchase on my road for supah-dupah disappointment.It's not scary, I think it's even funny. The characters arent scary, the SFX SUX, the textures are almost too wide, its ridiculous. I really tried hard to be scared but I just couldnt. I tried to enjoy it but I failed. It's like playing Counter Strike while on PCP."
2,Undying: Fun Dies Quickly,"It is disturbing to me that so many respected reviewers are praising a first person shooter without Multiplayer with 9.0+ and 5 star scores. Undying is a fair entertainment product that uses the Unreal Engine. It is not a ground breaking program, nor important piece of gaming history. It is a fair game bacause it accomplishes to create a horrific and spooky atmosphere using sound and inspired level design. It is unimportant due to failure in almost every other department. The single player game can be finished quickly in a few days and replay value is zero, considering the linear scripted story, which is under-developed to say the least."
2,The bugs are coming! The bugs are coming!,"It could have been easily the game of the year. It's downright horrifying and intense. With such masterpiece graphics, sounds and feel it is easy to forgive the lack of replay value. But, BUT, the horrible bugs inroduced to the game, along with a bad-balnced gameplay, just ruined it all. The weapons are lame, the control imprecise. Far too many mouse - excercise jumping exactly from here to there wear down the experience. Then there are the bugs- no doubt the worst monstaers out there. You must not ever drain the spears from the speargun- do so and no weapon will ever shoot again. Ah, and there are plenty more for you there. Try and see for yourself- your dissapointment is assured."
4,This is a great horror game.,"If you are a fan of horror games, scary movies or especially Clive Barker novels, then you will like this game. There are cool sound effects and the graphics are good also. It can get a little gory, so if you are sqeamish about blood, this game is not for you. There are 5 quests that you have to complete, with a boss character to defeat at the end of each one (I think - I have not completed the game yet.) You begin in a mansion and there are characters to interact with and the detail and amount of rooms in this mansion are incredible. I think this is a game worth the $40, for sure. Lots of hours of gameplay to complete this one."
5,Awesome Game!,"I am just getting into PC games, and this is a great one. Many places to explore and interesting creatures to encounter. Definately worth buying!"
1,"Too much blood, not enough game play","This game was difficult to play because the character was hard to maneuver (you see through his eyes), the controls were not user friendly, and at the drop of a hat, monsters are ripping your head off. Yuck! There are no fun puzzles and clues to figure out, it is just a bunch of running around chasing ""bad guys"". This is ok for the blood thirsty teen-ager, but not for someone who genuinely loves a good thought inspiring interactive game. If you are like me, get ""The Longest Journey"". That was the best game I have ever played. This one is a waste of money."
1,Quite possibly the worst lefse' ever made!,"This lefse' isn't even worth one star, but that was the lowest Amazon would let me go. There is no flavor to it what-so-ever. You can't taste the potatoes or the butter, all you taste is flour and it's very dry. It used to be better years ago when it slightly resembled the taste of potatoes, but as it is with many items, they must have found ways to save a buck at the expense of the quality & flavor. Don't waste your money! You're better off investing in the equipment to make your own, or finding a website that sells an authentic ""home-made"" variety. I grew up in a Scandinavian household that made traditional lefse' for family gatherings, trust me when I say Mrs Olson's is absolutely horrible."
2,Not Good,"I can't believe what the other reviews say about this disc. The vocals and music are wimpy and sappy. I bought this after I read the ""If you like Frost, you'll love this"" comment in the top review. Frost ""Milliontown"" is one of the great prog-rock albums of the last 10-15 years. To compare this piece of musical pablum with that masterpiece is criminal."
4,spatulas,good they are hard to find in the stores. they are also less expensive on line. highly recommend this product..
3,get On_Glass first,"I'm a huge fan of the Bauhaus family (incl. side projects). But I'll admit, some albums are stronger than others. For solo David J, Etiquette of Violence has some standout tracks, but it also has some less engaging ones. I'd advise only getting this if you like *every* track from On Glass. (That is his #1, and is *much* stronger.)"
1,Several Pairs Started falling apart,"Stay away from these, they are junk. Several pairs started falling apart after two months. Waste of money."
2,Disappointed,"I am a Kindle novice, so I may be missing something here, but I was disappointed to purchase this product and then find that I could not do a search on key words because ""Title not yet indexed."" If this facility is not available, then I think the buyer should be made aware of this before buying - it was the main reason I bought the Kindle version."
2,Worked great for about a year.,"I purchased this in May 2010 and was very pleased with it. It heated around 100 gallons (75/gal tank and a 30/gal sump) easily. However, I noticed this summer (June 2011) that it was no longer heating the water. Not sure what the issue is, even after making adjustments to the temperature setting.I would have expected a longer life. I like to use 100 watt heaters so that they do not turn on and off often (minimizing the wear and tear), nor will they overheat the tank quickly if it malfunctions in the ""on"" position."
5,This was a gift,"Great gift for a motocross enthusiast. I don't know anything about motocross, but since Amazon lets you page through the book, I was able to get a feel for the contents and that was a definate plus in helping me decide wether to purchase or not. The person I bought the book for loved it and actually had riden with one of the men mentioned in the book."
1,Someone should poke Donna Fletcher,"This book, as well as The Highlanders Bride is like reading on a loop. How many times do the heroines in both these books poke the ""out-of-my-mind-in-love-with-this-woman"" hero in the chest. I thought I was reading the same page over and over. This writer needs to expand her vocabulary. It drove me to distraction. And why is it that the women NEVER, EVER, listen to the guy, but are ALWAYS right. Read Garwood, Woodwiss, McNaught or even Putney for real historic romances."
1,Mormon?,"Very new-agey, not traditional Native American religion. I didn't read it all, I stopped reading when she starting espousing mormon beliefs about Jesus being Quetzecoatl and how he came to America in a conoe to spread the good word. It's like she just picked up the book of mormon, copied it, and added ""native"" words like ""earth mother"" and ""sky father"" to it. Very cheesy. Little too far out, even for me."
1,Crow Tribe cultural director speaks out,"Before you waste your time reading this book, go to this website Before you buy this book, go to this website www.sonomacountyfreepress.com/features/brooke-edwards.html.Then read ""Yellowtail: Crow Medicine Man and Sundance Chief"" to find a true Crow healer."
4,My Brother Likes It,Bought this for my brother - he loves it and he has good taste (and very wide ranging) so it must be good
1,not happy,I ordered a new book and got a used paperback. I didn't realize it until I opened the package. The price that I was quoted was $16. something and I got a used $4.95 paperback. I asked for an explanation of my account which had an Eighty-some dollar charge on it. Got no reply. Maybe I will get an explanation for the charge to my card if I say it here. NOT A HAPPY CUSTOMER.I have not read the book because as I get a reply I will be sending it back; I can't see me ordering anything from Amazon.com anymore.Judy A. Turner
3,Review of Panasonic KX-FP145,"Printing for incoming fax or copying is mediocre, as compared with Panasonic's older (forerunner) of this model."
4,operation,"THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE OPERATION OF THE FAX ARE HARD TO FOLLOW, AND SO FAR I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO HAVE THE FAX MACHINE AND THE OUTSIDE ANSWERING MACHINE TO COEXIST IN PEACE"
4,answering machine,"Seems to be a pretty good outfit answering machine works good, Haven't faxed with it yet so don't know how it will do, Plain paper is fine but ink container a little expensive."
2,Bad sound quality on answering machine,"I purchased this Panasonic fax/answering machine as I have another in a vacation home. The other is cordless this is corded. The difference with this corded model is the sound quality on the answering machine is awful - both my husband and I have to listen many times to figure out the message. Also, I've noticed that you have to put one page in at a time to fax anything."
5,I LOVEEE Panasonic,"Panasonic never lets me down, of all the things working in my apt that have been around for years, its the panasonics. No doubt this brand will go out of business cause its so good and not making money because their products are rock solid and last so long. I love this fax mahine, it was cheap, and it rocks. Ive had it for like 3 years now I think so far. Its a great phone and fax. It has tons of features. I actually dropped it and it still works. Its taken abuse and still works. I will continue to buy their products, they are the best brand out there."
5,Hard to find,This toilet seat is an odd shape and I had a hard time finding it. Even Home Depot did not have one!!!
1,Color is a shade of purplish pink - not dusty rose,"Flimsy plastic and yet quite expensive. I figured I was paying for the color, but it does not match dusty rose porcelain fixtures."
4,"The Seat Fit Fine, but Color is Off","This is one of those crazy toilet seats from the '80s that people used and the manufacturer stopped stocking in stores. Basically, a pain in the neck to find and worse to try to match the color.We ordered two of these. One of them was perfect and the right color. The second one, we were unable to get the same color as the (icky) yellow toilet. I'm not sure WHAT color it is! So, we're using the Biscuit/Linen one and it is miles better than the old (icky) toilet seat, but the color is off. So, for the one that matches, FIVE STARS. For the other? Only THREE. I wish it were easier to get the right color.Still, it arrived on time, the price was reasonable, I guess, and it's clean and new."
1,Outdated product,"This program is obsolete. It does not work on Win XP and is ""incompatable"" with Win 7. I am suprised that Amazon is still selling an obsolete program. It should be updated or removed from the market. Time has passed it by."
3,Hebrew Tutor,"This is the only computer program that I know of to help learn Hebrew. It hasn't been updated for many years, but it worked on my Vista computer and it did help me in my class."
1,Parsons Hebrew Tutor,"If you have a modern Computer with Window XP. DO NOT BUY THIS ! It will not run on XP. This program was produced in 1997, in computer years that is 100 years old. Had I known this would not run on XP I would never have bought it.Now I have a 15$ coaster."
1,So you want to buy some junk?,This program was produced in Windows 95 and never improved or even corrected. It is full is errors and is not worth a dime for people who do not already know Hebrew. Amazon shoud have cleaned this junk out 10 years ago!
5,One of MFSL's best,This is easily one of MoFi's best releases. The difference between the commercial cd version of this album and the MFSL version is astounding. You have to hear it to believe it. Highly recommended.
3,"Some gems, some duds","Certainly not the best Focus release---far from it. But I really like that beautiful flute on ""Tamara's Move"", which is far and away the best track on the CD and one of the best Focus tunes ever. Essential for the Focus fan, but not very exciting for the casual observer.I like the groove of the title track as well, and some very nice guitar work on ""Neurotika"".Other than that, it's just, well, OK."
3,out of focus,"Despite this recording Focus remains my all time favorite band. Focus 3 is amazing, Moving Waves & Hamburger Concerto contain some incredible music also. They can still obviously play but I'm less inclined to listen. Fine for background music..."
1,"Oh, yeah, they SURE do.","Not on my life. If they want the real deal, they best to get it going on with Andrea Bocelli. That's right, or they'll get it going OFF!"
3,big,"as another reviewer staed, pretty big. it worked for my honda rebel and was easy to use, oem part not any less"
1,item was misrepresented,this was to be a music CD. Instead it was a pamphlet. Money was refunded. I would still like to fine this music CD.
3,We weren't thrilled,There wasn't enough music on this CD. We wanted more songs to sing along with and less repeat songs and blank space for us to sing our parts.....
1,The Global City -Saskia Sassen,"If you can understand this book you are obviously incapable of living in the real world. Sassen's dense, turgid writing style simply aims to bewilder the reader into unquestioningly accepting her doomsday view of socitey. Most depressing reading."
5,Best Movie Ever,"We recomend this book and movie to all our friends.Our favorite is The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.Our favorite character is Mrs. Beaver."
4,WONDERFUL!,"Delightful: absolutely delightful! In this short, easy to read book, Father Petit delicately, and with great sensitivity, opens the mysteries of the Mass for all to see.Throughout the text, Father Petit's own faith and commitment are obvious: serving as an example to each of his readers.In the process of explaining each element of the Mass, in detail, Father Petit helps Catholics to rise above superstition. ...and he simultaneously helps Protestants to rise above prejudice. With his emphases on (1) the reality of salvation by God's grace made present to us in the Eucharist, and (2) the coming together of all God's people into the mystical Body of Christ, Father Petit demonstrates for Catholics and Protestants, alike, just how much we share in common.Do yourself a favor and spend an hour or two curled up with this good, little book."
3,MEH,Good for a basic phone but nothing more. No real features and nothing special is great if you cant hear very well because the ringer is loud.
5,A Necessary Part of the Mythology Series,"This review is more or less a reflection on the entirety of the Mythology series which streamlines the Alien conspiracy from begining to end.If there was any difficulty following the main story - this picks and chooses exactly what you need to know.In my opinion, this works best as a complete set and watched in chronological order from the pilot (on the Abduction Series) though the final episodes(on the Super Soldier Series.) In total there are 4 sets to complete the story chronologically. It's an affordable alternative to purchasing each season right from the get go.Highly reccomended as a fan of the X-Files."
4,X-files mythology vol. 3,"This was a very good ""supplement"" to the two (2) ""movies"" that have come out. This is a spin-off for the first movie and was quite good. I really enjoyed watching this."
4,Tow Cruicial Episodes Missing.,"I am absolutely furious that they ""forgot"" to put the Emily's episodes in this set !!Those tow episodes are so important in the mythology !!That's where we learn that Scully can't have children due to her abduction... and so much more !!It is quiet a shock to me ! (yeah, I'm a big fan ;) ).And those episodes are related to season eight/ nine (William....). I mean, it is really too bad !Shame on Fox who wanted 60 episodes to explain the mythoilogy ! 60 is apparently much more better than 62...Today, I'm sad ! :)Of course, the rest of the episodes are just ""amazingly"" great.4 stars just for the amazing 'Requiem'.(And it is where they should have stop the serie)... ;)"
4,"Great Story But Not Quite Enough ""Ghost"" In it.......",This is my first Barbara Michaels book but I have ordered about 10 more of her books. I really liked this story but just expected a little more Scary stuff in it.I loved the old gothic mysteries from years ago and would like to have seen more of this element to it. Overall it was very well written and interesting enough to keep me reading to find out who the ghost was. I do like her style though and have just started another one of her books. Barbara Michaels does have a new fan.
5,one heck of a good ghost story,I really enjoyed this book.A very spooky read.A defanit for all ghost story fans.I never read any of Barbras books before but I know she now has a new fan.
2,the walker in shadows,"This ""ghost"" story is a fairly good read, but rather disappointing compared to other books I've read by Barbara Michaels. Looking for a good Michaels book? Try Vanish with the Rose or Into the Darkness."
3,Didn't work with our machine,"After we used the CD, our CD player worked fine for about 3 minutes and then just stopped working completely - so I don't know if the machine already had a problem or the CD had something to do with it."
1,This is not for a wii,Bought this to clean our wii because other people said this worked for theirs. This doesn't work for our wii. Spend a little more and buy a product made especially for your wii. Waste of money for us. Don't know how it works in other devices.
1,it worked........at making my cd player not read cds at all,"Wow......i bought this because the cd player in my 2002 ford taurus was skipping ocasionally. Well...after using this product, every disc i put in gets kicked back out and the screen reads BAD. What a rip off....I guess the positive is now I dont have an excuse not to by a new CD player"
3,How do you know when it is done cleaning,"The instructions for this product say to follow the recorded voice instructions. I put it in my dvd player. A female voice comes on and says thanks for purchasing and then said the process will start after the tone. A tone comes on and then the voice says ""hit fast forward now"". I hit fast forward and then thats it. It does not come back and say anything about that the cleaning is done. I waited few minutes and just hit stop and eject. How do we know how long the process takes? It would be nice if it said ""this process will take x amount of minutes"" or something like that. How do I know if it worked?"
3,Sweet As,It came quickly and it worked. Extra words to meet the requirements. Even more words to meet the requirements. Apple.
1,"Tried it on 2 DVD players, no good","tOTALLY USELESS PRODUCT. dONT WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED CASH. I tried it on two mDVD players, wasnt worth it! I wouldnt recommend this to anyone!"
5,Digital CD Cleaner,This produce is a good value for the price. I am sure that the cleaner will help my CD/DVD player work better once they are clean.
1,Didn't work,"I returned this because it didnt work at all. Nothing ever even came up! Tried everything finally gave up, boxed it and returned it."
4,Got My MacbookPro Disk Drive working again!,"Keep trying, even if the first few tries are unsuccessful. It really works!My Macbook Pro initially gave it the same treatment that it was reserving for all media - ejecting within seconds. But soon enough, the CD loaded up, and after a painless cleaning process, my drive seems to be working again!Caveat - I haven't tested my DVD drive for very long after."
2,Not Write,"I purchased this product to clean the lens of the WII-the product misinformed about what it can be used for. It was not compatible for the WII, even though on-line it said it could. Very disappointed. Please check thoroughly about compatibility before purchasing."
1,Don't buy for Wii!!,"I wish I'd read a little further into the reviews...a recent review said that it had worked in the wii (in addition to a number of other devices), so I bought it for my kids' wii. It did not work at all, so then I read earlier reviews, all of which said it doesn't work for the wii."
5,Great cleaner (and a problem solver),I bought this for my MacBook Pro's disk drive after it stopped recognizing DVD+R disks. It could still read DVD movie disks.I was skeptical at first since the product didn't come with any liquid solution for the cleaning disk and the whole cleaning process took less than 5 minutes. But my drive starting recognizing all compatible disks without a problem.Highly recommended for desktop/laptop disk drives!
5,It works!,"I decided to take a chance on this disk cleaner and I was pleasantly surprised that it actually worked. In fact, I have used it on two additional cd players with equally good results. Definitely cheaper than taking the car into the shop."
1,The Red Army could not attack in 1941,"I read Icebreaker a few years after it came out and dismissed it for being an interesting view but not backed up by the facts. A friend said the debate continues and looking at these reviews I see it is true. Do NOT believe what is stated in this book. Ask for facts. The 29 Soviet Mechanized Corps on the border were a shambles. Readiness was below 40% in most and training was a disaster. This alone refutes the premise of icebreaker. David Glantz, the greatest Soviet military historian, flatly refutes icebreaker in his book, 'Stumbling Colossus'. Read 'Stumbling Colossus' if you want to know the truth about Red Army readiness and capability on 22 June 1941. Leave icebreaker for high school children and the gullible."
4,My anti-cold medicine,"I think everyone has a favorite remedy to take when they are coming down with a cold. This one is mine. Who knows if any of them are really helpful, but this and ColdSnap are the two I use. This one is definitely not for everyone because it has big pills that can be hard to swallow, and includes the capsaicin that is a good anti-inflammatory but also feels like you are swallowing cayenne pepper if it stays in your mouth too long."
5,Great tool,"I can't say much more than the other reviews. I wish I would have bought this one a long time ago. It is a very easy to use, safe, flexible system. I'm not even considering buying a cabinet saw anymore (for what I do, others may have a valid need for one). The customer service is great, and the product itself is wonderful. If you can try one out or you want to try mine :) you won't be sorry."
4,"Nice, except...","This is a nice tool, EXCEPT I soon discovered the depth of the maximum cut using my Milwaukee 6390 would NOT go all the way through 2x stock. I contacted EurekaZone and asked them about that, they said Yes, it's true, we forgot to mention that in our literature. I returned it the next day. I was trying to save some bucks instead of buying a Festool -- a mistake. If you want to use this on 2x stock you'd better make sure first that your circular saw will work with it."
5,Fluffy's Back And Better Than Ever,gabe is hillarious this second special is a laugh riot. this guy is so funny. and when he talks about his step son looking just like him it's true. i hope gabe puts out more specials i can't get enough of his comedy. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
5,Good Clean Comedy,I love this movie. He is one of the best comics I have ever heard. I would highly recommend this to anyone in need of a laugh.
5,Funny Show,"Great, show it was incredibly funny. His humor is very relate-able and best of all it is family friendly, which is hard to find with most comedians."
5,Gabriel Iglesias,This guy is hilarious! Funny & clean. The whole family can watch! I would recommend to anyone. Saw him on comedy special & ordered 2 tapes
3,Amazon Purchase. Not all that funny to my family. We are Weird!,"Amazon.com: Gabriel Iglesias: I'm Not Fat... I'm Fluffy: Gabriel Iglesias,NoeMaybe I was overly expecting this dvd to be hilarious, after reading all of the great reviews, but my family and I just couldn't seem to get into it or find much of anything to laugh at. I can't imagine why it was so funny to so many others, yet not to us. I guess it is just us. It was very disappointing, as we ALL need all of the laughs we can get these days.....especially this year. I lost my youngest son to a 4 year battle with cancer on 4/1/10, so it has been a very bad year in so many ways, with my son at the top of the list. YOU will probably find this show as funny as the others did, so don't rely on me as to whether you decide to buy it or not. I probably shouldn't even be writing this. Sorry. 12/21/10"
5,very pleased,"A real boyhood classic, perhaps the first realistic novel of American boyhood. Was a bit disappointed that none of the original illustrations, by A.B. Frost, were included."
1,disappointed,"The name of the story implies some good spoanking scenes. There were none in the whole book. I have no idea why this book was placed in the area of spanking stories. It was long, drawn out,really not interesting in the least."
4,Definitely worth it.,"I love my new case. I wanted something more feminine for the phone, and this definitely works. My only concern is that is sticks a little in warmer weather, or if I accidently leave it in the car. I would buy again!"
4,"Up, Up, And Awayyyyyyyyy",My son got this as a gift for his first birthday. He loves it. Mommy wishes it came with at least a pilot to put in the part that opens.All in all a good buy and great toy!
5,Traditions...,"Some traditions are best kept alive. They bring enjoyement to the public nd consumers. Dune is one of those traditions being kept alive for ten years.The first Dune II was pretty good. Still, the graphics, music, soundeffects, and difficulty were not the best.Dune 2000 had its graphics and difficulty amplified, while disregarding music and sef.Now Emperor has everything. The plot is intricate and interesting. Graphics are amazing, so are the new units. Great music and sef. It is a little difficult to play, so I would advice playing Dune 2000 first.In Emperor you play three houses: powerful harkonnen, loyal atreides, deceitful ordos- and five unique subhouses. Each has unique technology and strengths. You try to defeat the computer and take control of Dune.You play so many levels. Every new level you get new units and structures. The units get veterancy bonuses.Good Luck!"
2,Too slow and clunky,"Being a hard-core C&C/RE fan, I was excited to pick up Emperor this weekend. But after installing and playing it, I found it to be way too slow and clunky. I have a decent PC - PIII 750 128 megs etc. but I found the interface slow to use, the screen very slow to scroll, and the missions took forever to load. I found myself wanting to load up RE2 and play it. Maybe the upgrades will speed up the game to be playable, until then I am back on RE2."
4,Emperor - THAT is the directive!,"As a game that was declared as ""the most dangerous opponent to War Craft III"" (at least in my part of the world) Emperor hardly lives up to the expectations.A much better version of the classic Dune II, with much improved graphics, new and extremly cool units and some new concepts (such as the extended use of minor houses) - Emperor is still Dune II in a new suit. The story is quite boring (If I`ll hear the Ordos Mentat saying one more time: ""That is the directive I will explode! :)))) and the control system is much the same as the older Dune II.Still, for the RTS lovers, especially for the Dune universe fans - it`s a good choice.p.s. Try playing it while reading one of the Dune novels....it sure enhances the experience......"
2,Okay game but choppy on some computers,this game is kinda cool it is similar to starcraft but much faster peace as in you don't have to build up your city or what ever you want to call it as much.I'm running a penutm3 550 and 192 mags of ram and dsl connection. The game freezes. And when theirs a bit going on it gets choppy malti player games are pointless playing the menus don't even run smoothly. So maybe if you got a newer computer it might be worth buying but if you got like a 550 mhz or something you might want to think about it
5,Westwood is back on top,"The game that made RTS is back. After the dissappointing remake Dune 2000, Westwood strikes back with the 3D RTS. The amazing blend of the old RTS style that has made Westwood so great with the new 3D engine has created a world that makes Force Commander look like a child's toy. Oh, how far we have come since Dune 2 was released in 1992. If you like RTS games, this one must be at the top of your list. It is like nothing I have seen before and more. It is an epic game of 4 cds and an outstanding plot. RTS is back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"Not the best Dune game out there, but still not the worst","Emperor Battle For Dune is a mixed bag of a game. As a RTS its formula has been oftenly used and abused many times in other titles (especially the Dune II or Dune 2000 series), and the leap to 3D isn't entirely that spectacular.But considering the production value, this game is quite worth mentioning. There's a top actor Michael Dorn (of Star Trek's Lt Worf fame) playing the Atreides duke, and the costumes and props are all used from the 1984 David Lynch movie.Of course the storyline is a bit absurd... supposely to take place centuries before the main Dune storyline during the 'War of the Assassins'... serious Dune fans might have difficulty understanding it.The dynamics aren't too heavy... and most missions are pre-scripted and the campaign unfolds the same ways no matter what.But this game is quite worth playing (if you can find the hours the spare for it)."
5,RTS redefined,"The game that started it all is reinvented in Emperor. Even though the name and general play of the game is fairly identical to the classic Dune, the houses hand plot have both advanced to their own level. Each house has its distinct advantages and disadvantages. Units are balanced well so that many different stratiges may arise. The rush strategy, which pretty much killed any real stragety in Starcraft, is completley useless in Dune. I've seen wave upon wave of units die at my defenses and only those that are cunning enough actually make it through.An Excellent game with an excellent story backed up by great gameplay and graphics and a strategy that works. Westwood even managed to take some of the cheese out of its movies. Very good."
3,Th Sequel,Same as the dune 2000 only much tougher on the CPU. (Recommend over 700mmxspeed to play OK )
2,Sorely disappointed,"For a start, the game is incredibly demanding on hardware, even if you turn down all the graphics settings. My computer's about a year old, and has good sound/video cards as well as up-to-date drivers, but the game keeps freezing whenever it gets busy.Secondly, with the 3D graphics it's really hard to tell the units apart, unless you zoom right in.Thirdly, your own units are incredibly stupid: They're magnetically attracted to the enemy's guns, even when you specifically select a safer route.And finally, everything happens so fast that you never get a chance to defend - either you've put up enough defences in the first place, or when the enemy attacks, it's all over in a few seconds."
5,a good game,"THis game is very good. it may be impossibble to beat though. You have to capture all the territories of a mjority of the planet and capture the planet. It is like commmand and conquer but you must make you own alliances,(and lose them)defend territories,make sure you don't retreat or forfeit to much or you will be executed. It is slightly corny that some of the charecters from the movie/book are in this with different names. overall this is a very good 3-d strategy game"
4,Once it was the best,"Well, this game was pretty good at the time it was released.. But AI is just to stupid to play single player, and multiplayer is poor. I would say, if you like real time strategies, Generels: Zero Hour is far better choice +this game is definitely not worth its current price.. Although 2 years ago it was fun."
1,This game would be fun.. if I could play it...,"I'm sure this game would be great, if it would run on my computer. I have windows ME, a pentium 4 1.7, a geforce 3, 256 ram, sblive, latest drivers... and for some reason, westwood (the developer) couldnt bother to test it on a new system? I've tried costumer support, no help there, but i did discover pleanty of other problems other people have had with the game. Also, the minimun requierments are far short of what you really need, this game requires a lot more then they say, not to mention that if you have an athlon processor, it wont run. And system requirements are the irony where my problem lies with this game.. because I have one of the only systems that would run the game in all its visual glory."
2,"Take AofE, add sand, voila","I would normally try to give you a comprehensive review, but if you're always looking for the next best RTS (like me) you're probably already familiar with this game.Forget about comparing it to previous Dune titles. I'm constanly running into the same game with different fixings: C&C, Age of Empires, Star Wars, and now Dune. Collect, spend, fight, collect, spend, fight. Boring but still fun if you haven't tired of the same old formula."
2,Not a bad rehash,"Emporer is a well done 3D rehash of all the other Westwood Studios real time strategy games. This time however, most combat turns into a battle of attrition forcing even more unit buliding than in the C&C and RA games. They spent a lot of time/money on full motion video that could have been better spent on new, innovative units and gameplay tweaking."
3,"If it's going to be Dune, it should at least be Dune!","After having read this description and seeing a gameplay video, I am very disappointed at this game. It calls itself Dune, but so much is incorrect about it. The actual game itself is a prettier version of Red Alert 2, which was excellent. I guess if you want that cozy feeling that you are playing a Dune game, not pretending you are, than you should get this game. I find the faster paced strategy games to get rather obsolete faster (how ironic). Spice takes a long time to get a full load, as demonstrated in Dune II, but the faster the mining is the more unrealistic it gets. Your best bet is to find another strategy game, but if you want Dune than you can get this."
2,Be atredies(i know im a bad speller),"well, another game from westwood, another very unfair game from westwood. This game graphics r pretty bad(good for the time though) so im not going to complain about that. The one thing that made my rating for it so low was because the ONLY tactic the computers use is mass rushing, which ive noticed the atredies are by far best at. They have the best unit in the game by the way, which has best attack force,and best defence Its speed is preety terrible, but if you try to run out in the open to try to kill it, the other computers attack you before you can as much as weaken it. I wouldn't reccommend this game to any new real time strategy players; however i would reccommend it to people who enjoy rushing games."
1,This games looks superb but...,it works on almost no computers except for like a pentium 32 and the game play isnt that good even if you play. This game has to be one of the worst westwood has created. If you like games games like this I would definitly get Age of the Empires II or Red Alert 2. They are much better than this
3,Low artificial intelligence drags it down.,"I like a lot of Westwood's work (especially Dune-themed stuff), but I wish they'd focus a bit more on A.I for once. With decent A.I., this game could easily have been worth 4 or 5 stars. A.I. in RTS games in general really needs a breakthrough soon, but in Emperor, it's just too lacking. Come on...it's 2001. Let's start seeing some intelligent computer opposition, Westwood.A decent game, but could and should have been so much more."
5,Pearls of Wisdom,"Ms. Thomases takes life and explains it to us! She has the abilitiy to take circumstances that we are all so familiar with and helps us to see how they are part of life's game. Read on and realize not only how you can ""win"" at playing this game, but how you can actually have fun during even the most challenging of circumstances! Read the chapter about ""The Five Rules"" and you'll see exactly what I mean. It's one of those books that, as you read, you are saying to yourself, ""but of course, that makes perfect sense!"" If you miss what Ms. Thomases has to say, you'll never know how you could have applied it to your own life!"
1,Horrible reissue of the book,"This is a horrible reissue of the old book. The main problem that the diagrams for positions are unreadable. Rather than using real diagrams, they are typed with a keyboard, with letters standing for the pieces and horizontal and vertical lines delineating the squares. But, get this, that is not even done in a fixed-width font so it is readable! It is done in a proportional-spaced font so most of what should be blank space is taken out, so the columns don't line up! Furthermore, very often the ""diagrams"" are broken by the page breaks. And to make it even worse, the first line of each ""diagram"" is indented.That alone is sufficient to avoid the book. But, in addition, there is a clumsy attempt to translate the original Descriptive Notation for chess moves to Algebraic Notation, which isn't even close to standard.Do not buy this reissue of this book, published by General Books."
1,I just gave up... cannot find the romance,"Kept hoping each chapter of this so called romance would pick up. But not for me. Basically its a rotten family pimping out their beautiful and niave daughter. Blackmail and scandal. Just too much for me. Made is about twio thirds through. Never even got to the supposed plot of her new husband, who was tricked into marrying her, cheating on their honeymoon with some other women so she goes back to her lying family and her husband tries to win her back at a charity auction. Everyone tells this girl she is a beauty and basically thats about it. Sorry not for me. Others may like this though."
5,A Broad Look At Bugs Moran and 1920s Chicago,"This book is a well-researched, fascinating study of the life of the gangster known as George ""Bugs"" Moran. I liked this book because it dealt with the subject in an intelligent manner. It focused on little-known aspects of Moran's career as the dark horse of the Chicago Outfit. It also encompassed the town of Chicago as a landscape that hosted this violent era.For students of the 1920s and the Chicago bootleg era, this book is a ""must read."" I highly recommend it, as a serious study of the Roaring Twenties, Al Capone, the St. Valentine's Massacre, and the gangsters' role in 1920s Prohibition."
4,This is a decent introduction to soul jazz,"IF you want a better and multi artist introduction to soul jazz, then I would recommend that you find ""So Blue, So Funky."" This is a good album, and it is just about worth an MP3 purchase.Patton did better work on ""Along Came John,"" though none of the tracks on here were bad."
5,Amazing,"Helena Meirelles shows all her virtuosism in this amazing CD, playing beautifully the Gibson Dobro Guitar. This item is a must for world music enthusiasts."
4,Hardback?,"I love the whole dragonlance series and I'm glad there is a good reading copy of the legends trilogy. However, I wish I had a hardback copy as well..."
3,"Excellent story, HOWEVER.........","The notes by TRH are just awful. After reading both the Annotated Chronicles and Annotated Legends, I found myself no longer reading the side notes by TRH. Most of them were not helpful or insightful as he tends to repeat the same ideas. His own arrogance shines through over and over again as he leads us to believe he singlehandedly created most everything in the Dragonlance universe or had all of these ideas planned out from the beginning. The notes by Margaret Weis were much more helpful/insightful and felt much more genuine than those by TRH.I have really enjoyed everything I have read by these two authors, however I would recommend reading the paperbacks instead, they are just as good and will save you money. Plus you will be spared wasting your time with the generally useless comments by Tracy Hickman!"
2,Waste of Money,"The first 6 dragonlance books (Chronicles and Legends Trilogies) remain for me, the greatest works in Fantasy ever written. The poor rating I give to this volume is due only to the useless commentary that I so hoped would provide insight into the story. What the authors merely do is provide offhand comments that either repeat themselves or detail things that I found uninteresting. I was seeking more detail into what Raistlin had experienced in his journey, ie..what actually went on when Soth and Raistlin first encountered each other in Shoiken Grove. What did Raistlin face when he entered the Abyss and battled the Dark Queen's army. Why did the mage council simply not kill Raistlin outright. Why did the Dragonlance Adventures book have such inappropriate stats for the characters involved in this story. Alas, none of these were answered."
5,"Yes, I'm persnickety!","Do you hate the ""fingernails on a blackboard"" sound of a metal leaf rake on the driveway? Well, it drives me up the wall!The answer is retro: The bamboo leaf rake! Light and available in wider widths than the steel rake, so you get back to the game sooner.I can't find them at the big hardware stores or the small ones, either. The answer, of course, is Amazon! And they arrive at your door!"
5,A Treasure,"I used to listen to this album as a little girl in the 70's and I now have the pleasure of sharing it with my 7 month old son. the songs are sweet, easy to sing along to, and you simply HAVE to dance to them! I sing the beautiful ""One Grain of Sand"" to my baby every night and he falls asleep to this fantastic lullaby in the car every time we play it. The stories are fun too. ""Abiyoyo"" will never drive you crazy, no matter how many times your child asks to listen to it...that's a promise. This album truly is a treasure."
2,Good performer -- fair production quality,"This kite has a good overall flight performance with the exception of excessive oscillation in the wing tips at high speed (15k wind). Only fair production quality -- one of the female connector's glue attachment came apart in first assembly. The other two came off after first flight -- not happy making repairs right out of the box. Good product but should be better made, or better quality control at this price level. I have cheaper kites from other lines that are made just as well if not better."
5,Go fly a Kite! It's a BLAST!!!!!!!!,"I have not flown a kite since I was a kid. It's sad that I waited so long to go back to something this fun.It's a great work out, not that hard and something for the whole family or a group of friends.Great time with lots of laughs a really great time.Prim kites I think are some of the best on the market. I say that because I have 5 different brands and a total of 12 kites. Why so many, because my family and friends get together on the park for food and kites!Go to another level of fun and closeness with the ones you love. Yes you can get them to fly a kite, oryour just not a very good sales person. Happy flying :)"
5,totally engrossing,"You will find this book hard to put down. Interesting characters, good storyline. The book is intelligently written and has great depth."
1,Not what expected,"I was not aware this was a Christian book and I am not a Christian, nor is the pregnant woman that I purchased the book for. I do notice now there is a Christian, religious tag, but that wasn't evident in the search that I did for pregnancy journals."
3,Pleasant book,"This book is great because it has references to God & many other spiritual/Christian sayings. But I wish it had places for pictures & mementos (ultrasound); it is strictly journaling. I will most likely add my own pictures once I start to show & will just paste those over the journaling lines. I'm almost tempted to just buy another one & use both but it's hard to find one for both parents, one that mentions God in any way & overall this one is ok."
2,Be wary of this until you are SURE what you are getting,"I sent this item back. I didn't realize there would be basically a WHOLE section of pages that refer to Christianity. If you are Christian and plan to bring your child up that way, then this is the book for you. If not, I would suggest something else. If it was just a few pages, I probably would have kept the book and just skipped those pages. But, there are QUITE A FEW PAGES... THIS BOOK WAS CLEARLY MADE FOR CHRISTIAN PEOPLE. And I am just not comfortable with that. I was highly disappointed because I would love to share spiritual things with my child, and the rest of the writing topics were fine. If the pages had just been worded differently so they were more of a spiritual nature than a pure CHRISTIAN nature.... I mean, to each his own. But, this obviously wasn't the book for me. There are so many other people and religions in the world.... I suppose I will just have to look for something better suited to my own beliefs."
1,Free video - Just one long ad for IBD,"This video contains a 20-minute infomercial for Investors Business Daily (IBD).There are no ""secrets"" here, except to subscribe to IBD. They gave this video away free to anyone who asked. They probably have a newer DVD or Youtube you can watch if you're looking for infomercials on IBD.This is not a rating of the company, their newsletter, the VHS quality, etc. I'm just here to inform you this is an advertisement/infomercial from 1997, with no real content. If you're looking for a video on investing, look elsewhere."
3,+/-,"O produto no veio como o descrito, veio faltando alguma parte ou danificado, mesmo assim o vendedor reembolsou meu dinheiro!"
5,Bacanisimo!!!,"Todas las canciones que estan en este albun estan genal, puros éxitos!!! Si nunca has escucho muchos de sus hits, este es el albun que debes comprar."
1,Incredible,"It is incredible that such an inaccurate, ill-informed and terribly written piece of junk could ever be published. The author is an unmitigated fraud and has clearly not bothered with reality. Buy the book if you have a scientific background and might enjoy a (shallow)chuckle. If is very much on a par with books about horoscopes,spirits and other silly inventions. An awful read!"
1,no good,"This book doesn't contain ANY of the diagrams Ed created to go with the text. It's impossible to understand without them.I found a copy of them online, and it helped a LOT.A complete copy of Ed's writings & diagrams can be obtained by calling the Coral Castle cashier at: 305-248-6345"
1,disappointed this is called a book,"It's a 19 page pamphlet, printed on one side of the page with no schematics or drawings. The content IS on the internet. I was hoping for Leedskalin's application of magnet current through patent drawings, schematics and experiments."
2,Unbelievably BASIC!,"I thought this book would be more informative about the person who wrote the book and his amazing uses of magnetism to move large objects. This book is really just about the principles of magnetism which you can get from any library for free. Don't waste your money on this one...if you really want to read it, get a copy from a library as well as newer information available."
3,Quite an amazing fella,Edward Leedskalnin was a very interesting man. He had some wild ideas about virtually everything. Magnetism was only one. I am fascinated by all of his theories.
3,Whay I bought the book,"Once on PBS, I saw a program about the author who was said to have learned the secrets of the pyramids. While the book is not well written, I wanted to see if I could see something that made sense. It doesn't yet, but I'll keep trying."
2,This book is 90% incomprehensible and 10% gibberish.,"I am fascinated by Leedskalnin, but read the opening sentence: ""The writing is lined up so when you read it you look East, and all the description you will read about magnetic current, it will be just as good for your electricity.""Huh? If anyone else has deciphered this tome, let me know!!"
3,"Good ""time travel"" romance","I enjoy the ""time travelling"" romances, and this one is ok, it has an evil faery and the faery queen of the underworld, the dead highwayman seeking to change his past. It was ok, not the greatest of its genre that I've read."
2,Wasn't Impressed,Didn't do it for me. Read more like a Young Adult book. Had a difficult time finishing it but did because I had nothing else to read at the time.
1,Not Happy,"Unless you are an electrical engineer, do not purchase this with the intent to self-install it in a Chrysler product with a one-wire lock/unlock system. After about a week and half of trying to install it myself (with 2 calls to Audiovox's technical support people), I finally had to take it to a professional. To make it work, the professional had to add another part (at a cost of $57.00). The final insult is that to make the system unlock all doors you have to (1) press the unlock button, (2) wait until the driver's door unlocks, and (3) exactly 3 seconds after the driver's door unlocks, press the unlock button a second time. Failure to follow this procedure exactly results in extreme frustration (but not unlocked doors)."
1,Audiovox AA925 Security and Remote Start System WRONGLY LABELED,"I order two and thought I got an excellent price.The Audiovox AA925 is advertised as a Security and Remote Start System.It is wrongly described and does not have these features.The instructions only described setting up the keyless entry.There were no directions or wires for the remote start and security features.I called Audiovox technical support, in order to pick their brains.The technician confirmed that it ONLY was capable of these features.I asked him ""please explain exactly what you mean by capable""?He explained those features only work with optionally purchased controllers.The controller for the remote start was another $70.00 add on.I didn't ask about the security one, since I was only interested in remote start.I recently returned them to Amazon for a full refund, since they were mis-represented.So be advised: This is ONLY a Keyless Entry System !!!"
4,Useful insights from Dell's direct sales success story,"If you are in the computer business, or in sales, you already know the Dell story. It's about a driven man, Michael Dell, who came up with a simple idea - direct sales - and then expanded his company into the world's second biggest manufacturer of personal computers. Dell's personal story is inseparable from the story of his company, and his book gives readers his unfiltered, first-person perspective. He covers his company's history, challenges, problems and successes in an unvarnished, matter-of-fact style. We highly recommend this book to anyone in the computer industry, to entrepreneurs and to managers who want to make their small businesses grow."
3,good but missing a little something,"Michael Dell is a tech wunderkind. He is a successful businessman. He may be considered a visionary. A business author??? I just thought this book was a little too fragmented for my taste. The book could have gone the way of a full biography or full business lesson. There's valuable insights but the majority is padding. The book could have been condensed to a slim volume. Overall, I thought it was good but nothing spectacular. This shouldn't matter to those who view Dell as an iconoclast. It will belong in your collection."
4,OK book...,An interesting perspective from the man himself. Dell goes through how he started the company.
3,Useful only if you want to know Dell's history,"Two parts in the book: one for Dell Co. development, another for Dell's management.I know Dell as it dominates the PC market for serveral years, and it seems that Dell is a few companies that can earn money in this low-return industry. When I studied Operation Management, I was taught Dell has been very successful by its DIRECT model and its stock flied and flied. Direct from Dell provdies the first hand information as it is written by Dell's chairman and CEO, Michael Dell, although I don't know how much is written by him.It do let me know more about Dell's history and how Michael became rich, and, that's all. This is the first part of the book.After reading a few pages in the second part, I lost interest. Dell talks about his management principles, but many of them could be found in management books--nothing special and not worth to read. So I stopped."
4,e-Supply Chain...what to take away from the Dell book,"Dell has become the model for Internet-based business (together with Cisco). Lesson #1- everyone in the company has to strive towards Return on Invested Capital. That means negative working capital, and inventory of around 6 days at Dell. You've heard about the other lessons- go direct, customer focus, customer segmentation etc. The book gives the reader a case study which shows that all of these work in practice."
3,Banal and Uninsightful,"Michael Dell sure isn't an exciting writer. His writing style rivals the Dell's technical manual on excitement. It isn't as if he lacks exciting stories to tell. Dell is one of the greatest success stories in business. But I found his stories to be downright boring. For example, he writes about how he managed the Coke Vending machine at one of his old factories...Who cares??? I wanted to get insights on how Dell beat hundreds of competitors in a business where product and price differentiation are minimal. On this, I was very disappointed. Dell repeatedly sites three things for his company's success 1)execution and 2)having the right people 3)selling direct. But there are other competitors who had the same qualities and now they are either minor players or out of business. This book didn't really gave me the insights I was hoping for."
2,Worthless,"Worthless and waste of time and money. There is no great strategies discussed in the book, book is throughout boring and repeating. Author sees the reader as a potential customer. You have a feeling that you were listering to a salesman aggressively trying to sell his products."
2,Be careful reading this if you consider working there...,"From a Dell employee: Consider yourself warned if you think you can read Michael's book and think you'll know what it's like at Dell.I'm paraphrasing, but among other things, Michael says Dell is a non-political environment. Hah!He also says that performance reviews (and bonuses) are based on 360 degree review. Hah! They are, in reality, based on the kind of subjective, curve-based direct manager reviews that Michael so righteously rails against in the book (look it up).Either Michael is out of touch, or someone else wrote that book."
4,"Good book so far, condition was a little worse than i was expecting but nothing to get upset about","Bought this book after a recommendation from a friend - seems good so far, but haven't finished it yet. Seems good and the condition was good enough to read, although I had expected it to be a little better but nothing to get too upset about. Good deal all around."
4,An arbitrager without brokers,"DELL's business model is like an arbitrager without brokers.As Michael Dell said ""I've always been fascinated with eliminating unnecessary steps."" He always tried to do this since he was a child.This also explains why Dell want to keep zero-inventory.In general, it is a book worth reading because Michael shared his own experience."
3,Direct from Dell how he built Dell,"The first part of this book gets off to a quick pace with an enthralling first-hand account of how he built Dell from nothing into an industry powerhouse and you can't help but leave from reading it excited. Unfortunatley, after about 100 pages the book shifts entirely into a lengthy, dry and excurciatingly boring managmenent discourse."
4,Fast-paced,"Reading this book shows you how fast a business can grow really super fast. Dell started out in his dormroom making computers for customers and now is worldwide. Dell takes you through every step of the way in his monstorous growth. He posed problems that arised from when a company grows too fast, and shows how he solved them in turn.The book is an amazing triumph in our computer age. You get a better idea of what happened in the 1990's with computers through Dell's unique perspective."
2,interesting personal story but low value,Michael Dell tries to tell us how is company has been so successful and winds up writing an incredibly self serving biography even for a business man. It is so useless on information that it is amazing he got as many pages he did. Basically if you want to succeed in business you have to be brilliant like he is. While the direct to consumer model is very interesting his claim that he should be the sole possessor of it is ludicrous but what can you do. Read at your own risk.
3,"So easy, a caveman can do it.","Many of the people who claim that ""Remind Me"" is the highlight of this album are probably bandwagoners (not all, but many). ""Sparks"" is the best song on the album by far, in my opinion. ""Remind Me"", ""Eple"", and ""In Space"" (beautiful song, close second to Sparks) are all great but the rest of the album I could do without."
4,quirky,"First time I listened to Melody A.M., I was a bit mystified. But I'm hooked on Royksopp's diverse melodic landscape. From lounge, to upbeat, then spacey, the album's an intriguing trip."
4,Very pleased,"I bought this because of the commercial - and although some reviews were only possitive about the one song, I found the rest of the songs to be enjoyable although they are quite different."
2,Just a few good tracks,"Quite inconsistent. I liked ""Remind Me"" ( the GEICO commerical ) and ""Poor Leno""... Better to support the artist by buying downloads individually."
2,"remind me and eple are great, the rest is mediocre","Like so many others, I tracked this down because of the Geico commercial. Remind Me is a brilliant pop track..it's unique and it sticks in your head. Then there's Eple, which is equally catchy even though it's an instrumental. Poor Leno almost cuts it, but beyond the hooky chorus, it's a bore as listening material...maybe good for dancing if that's your thing. The rest of the disc varies from mediocre to unlistenable. She's So features some horrible b-movie saxophone and all the other tracks have variously annoying traits and no songwriting or vocal work of the caliber of Remind Me.My advice...buy Remind Me and Eple at itunes store and skip the rest. Sorry Amazon. Your mileage may vary."
3,Meh,"I was hoping for more like the ""Remind me"" song from the Geico commercial. Overall there are about 3 songs that i can really get into. If you are looking for good lounge music, i picked up Theivery Corperation and liked that much more."
4,Pleasant Surprise,"I bought the album after hearing the partial song on the Geico ad. I was pleasantly surprised to find myself enjoying the entire album. The style is fresh and the album is upbeat, but varies from song to song. The Geico song was the closest to 'elevator music' on the album.I would recommend this album to anyone who likes progressive pop/rock."
4,Very Good!,"This is a hypnotically wonderful album; filled with a lot of complex but entertaining melodies. If you like groups like Orbital, Underworld or Massive Attack then give this CD a try."
4,"Just to clarify, it's nothing NOTHING like boards of canada","if anything this is closer in feel to bent's ""progammed to love"". Dreamy downtempo electronic pop music with the occasional vocal thrown on top. If you love bent, I'm sure you'll love this. If you love BoC, you may hate this if you're buying it based on the comparisons. Nothing like BoC but still good on it's own. Eple and Sparks are my favorite and don't forget to check out the cool Esher-eque video to Eple that's included in the disc."
4,Subtle and moving,"Melody A.M. is a great album. I don't see how anyone could think ""Remind Me"" is the only good track on this album."
2,NORWEGIAN NOTHING,"The Amazon editorial review for Royksopp's ""Melody A.M."" declares, ""Arguably the best album of 2002"". Well, here's the argument: This is derivative drivel. Minimal song structures with elaborate trappings consisting of dropped and bent notes to make the contrived melody more interesting. The constant weak musical passages serving as songs give way to worn lyrical melodies making the whole CD ring like a shallow musical grave. At best, the third track, ""Sparks"" sounds like England's 'Broadcast' after a few double martinis and the fifth, ""Poor Leno"" is certainly late '90s 'Everything But the Girl"". I'll be darned if I don't hear 'The Pet Shop Boys' in here as well if you were to poke them with a stick and force them to make a new album. It all sounds very familiar and I suspect it's a case of buried and disguised plagiarism."
2,overrated,"There's nothing here that struck me as anything more than background music for shopping at Victoria's Secret. Some of it bubbles along amicably, but it's virtually souless. This is cold, programmed and stale. Sorry for the short review, but I never got into this album much with so much more fascinating music out there.=+K%- ----> I'll leave you by offering a suggestion: get a dZihan & Kamien album instead - open your mind to some REAL music!"
2,not good,"I bought this album because of Epie. I thought since that song was so bubbly and fun to listen to that the rest would be similar. I was wrong. I can admit it. The rest of the songs are boring, uninspired, and lifeless. You might like that sort of thing, so be sure to listen to it before you buy. I played it 3 times. Once for the first listen, twice because I thought I may have been ingoring some subtlties, and 3 times just to make sure it sucks. It won't get played ever again."
5,"A Breathtaking, Sheer Hypnotic Trance...","I heard them first, one night in my local club (at 5 am !) and it was around winter 2001. Soon I get the album and found out that those Norwegian Guys have an extraordinary talent to tickle my ears with the ""zephyr"" (serious!). For me this is one of my favorite album and it stays in my stereo for a long time since."
5,Stunning!,"This has got to be one of the finest post club albums ever. From the opening beauty of the Bobby Vinton sampled So Easy to the straffing symphonics of In Space, this album will turn heads, get toes tapping, give you goose pimples and make you cry at the ridiculous simplicity of it all. And if Eple doesnt put a smile on your face, then theres no hope brother!Absolutely essential!"
3,Run of the mill downtempo,"I must say I am pretty disappointed with this release. I bought the album without hearing it first, going instead by the recommedations here at amazon. Thinking I was buying one of the better releases of 2002, I received instead downtempo music that is just bland. Don't get me wrong, the plush beats and symphonic sounds are all there. But there is nothing to separate Royksopp from any other downtempo artist. Nothing here is new. I have heard the same sorts of music from Mr. Scruff or Dynamic Syncopation or even K&D(in a slower version)."
4,Sad that it's so difficult to get radio play in the US,"After living in the UK for over a year, I'm amazed at how many artists are passed over in the US and you never here of them. Our radio sacrifies so much good foreign music to bombard us with horrible boy bands who can't even write their own stuff and are just eye candy to teen girls!Royksopp is great Euro-music. I'm not a huge club kid or anything like that and Royksopp still appeals to me as either chillout or dance music. A definite buy if you like something different, yet good."
5,Fantastic Chillout music,"Melody AM is the debut cd by Norwegian duo Röyksopp. It is dreamy (almost haunted), ethereal, electronic, mostly instrumental music, with eerie vocals sweeping in and out in places.`So easy' opens the cd with a stomping beat, beautiful music with vocals rising in and out, sounding like part of the soundscape.`Eple' is a technological wonder, electronica at it's finest. Richly textured, the song sweeps up, down and sideways, with bleeps and soaring synths.`In space' is another beauty, with tumbling sounding keyboards and swooping, electronic strings.`Remind me' reminds me (pun intended) of the Pet Shop Boys in their hey day, razor sharp synth work, a great dance beat, and soothing, easy sounding vocals. One of few sung performances on this cd, the others being `Poor Leno' and the tender `Sparks'.If you love electronic/dance music, and are looking for something different and wildly innovative, it will be tough finding a cd more beautiful and satisfying than this."
4,My Kingdom for a Ruler!,"The Kingdom of Moltz is an entertaining and humorous cartoon book that greatly simplifies the economic concept of inflation, and how the system is created and abused by those in charge -- in this case, the King of Moltz. A fast read, but leaves you with a powerful understanding of inflation and monetary systems that economic students spend years trying to learn. Great for adults and kids alike.The book appears to be an earlier and less extensive version of Schiff's ""How an Economy Grows and Why It Doesn't."""
5,Satisfied customer,This book arrived promptly in new condition. It is the best translation of Chekhov's plays I have ever read. Our play-reading group enjoyed reading it together.
2,Modern American Translation Betrays Chekhov,"Schmidt's translation sounds smooth to a modern American, and thus eases the American actor's job. It fails, however, to bring the real Chekhov to the English language. Chekhov's writing has a rhythm, a compactness, and a vocabulary that is uniquely his, one that inimitably captures a very distinctive slice of Russian life as it existed one hundred years ago. It is possible to show this slice to an English speaking audience, but Schmidt had no interest in doing this. That is why this translation is a failure.A secondary but equally unforgiveable fault is that he adds his own stage direction to the text. For instance, he adds the word ""beat"" to the text in places where Chekhov had nothing at all. The American concept of a stage ""beat"" had not even been invented yet!"
2,Dislikes new translation,"Although the author does a very good job putting the text of the plays into the modern English vernacular, I feel as though the works have had their flavor removed. If you are a purist, like I am, stick to the ""old"" translation."
1,Terrible,"Schmidt's translation is very popular with modern actors because he has 'updated' the text. He has also reduced the poetic value. There is none. That's why American actors like it so much--- we have no poetry in us! Gimmickry substituted for lyricism. I teach about these plays (Graduate School, Conservatory and Professional level) and when actors bring in this text, it hurts my ears. ""Fresh"" it my be, but as Chekhov himself might have said, ""Yes, well, very nice, but it's not my play!"" Ann Dunnigan (Signet classics), Robert Corrigan (out of print), Carol Rocamora (Smith and Krauss), ALL, are far more beautiful."
2,Not for extreme chewers,"Got this toy yesterday for our 4 month old German Shepherd puppy. She's been tearing apart most toys because she's gnawing on them with the side of her mouth - teething like mad. I thought this would be soothing to her since it had nubs and ripples and it's thin enough she can gnaw on it like she's been gnawing on all the other (cloth) toys.The shape is perfect, but the rubber is not hard enough. Within five minutes she was pulling rubber pieces off the toy that had been torn by her gnawing. She'll get to work on it, provided she's well supervised. This toy is a good idea and great shape, but would be better if there was a harder rubber option."
5,Good projection alarm clock,"I had seen a projection alarm clock in Costco in 2008 for [...] but never bought it thinking its expensive for a china made alarm clock. I think it had an option to change colors to red, green or blue.I decided to finally get one but Costco didn't have it anymore. So I came here on Amazon looking for he cheapest one. This is the cheapest one I could find and it turned out to be great. This is just what I wanted. It points to the ceiling and I can see the time anytime in the night easily without turning or moving.It works fine. Comes with an adapter to save on batteries. You must install a pair of AA batteries so that in power failure you wont loose the time. The alarm and LCD display work on batteries alone but not the continuous projector. So you can take the alarm on camps and outings without any worries of electricity.Great buy for the price."
2,Not what I expected,"When I opened the clock, it was cheap looking and it is extremely hard to set the time accurate. Not user-friendly at all."
3,A bit small,"This was a great gift idea. It turned out to be a bit smaller than I expected. My nephew loved it though. However, the projection of the time was a little hard to read. we also had to return it because the clock display was not semi broken (possibly during shipping)."
1,One of the truly bad ones,"One shouldn't waste to many words of rubbish like this. The film is seriosuly inept. The likable lead might have been better employed with a half-decent script, director and cast."
2,not complete Aikido,"""Complete Aikido"" is anything but complete. Only 53 of the 289 pages are about waza (the actual moves). They state openly at the beginning of that section that these are merely a few selected waza instead of the complete 50 basic moves. For someone looking to supplement their instruction or review what they learned, this is far from complete. For someone looking to learn Aikido from a book, this is definitely the wrong choice. Its only saving grace is that is does have a good coverage of the spiritual side of Aikido and its history and founder. I really find this book to have very limited uses."
3,good but not outstanding,"This is another great work. Sensei Roy Suenaka gives a no-nonsense narrative of his history with aikido as well as basic technique and training tips. There is also reference to Seunaka's friendship with one of the founders of the Shorin Ryu style of karate and Suenaka's experiences with Sensei Saotome. Great history, Great technique advice and overall entertaining reading."
3,not complete,"i bought this book because of the word ""complete"" but it is far from complete. first part is about roy suenaka's aikido auto/biography, about half the book - which i am not reallt interested in (i'm most interested in O'Sensei's). most memorable thing was how angry suenaka was when he fought off a drunk? because it seems rather odd.second part is just too brief for absolute beginners. it even explains what is NOT included in the discussion/instructions and the reason - that there are just too many techniques and combinations of techniques. i also expected a lot of illustration/photographs. complete equals details, lots and lots of information, and several 'kitchen sinks' at least. these are missing."
3,Restored version sounds great - Why not widescreen?,"Very enthusiastic about all the extras and the ""restored"" version of this Disney film. It was listed as widescreen for a long time, but now is listed as full-screen. ... That is the beauty of DVD technology."
3,Shouldn't Helen Reddy Be Listed As One of The Stars On The Amazon Listing?,This is a great movie for families and kids but as I recall when this was released Helen Reddy was the main billed star but Amazon doesn't even have her listed in the tag line for the title. She is on the cover of the disc case but no mention of her in the main title seems strange to me. What's up with that?
3,Childhood favorite,Love this movie as a child and I collect Disney Movies so it was a must have. Not as funny as when I was a kid but it was still a great movie.
4,Nice classic,"For the limited technology that was available at the time - practically Stone Age compared to what we have in 2011! - the merging of animation and live action in this movie was nicely done, with a fun story of a orphan who runs away - and for good reason - and the dragon he befriends. This is definitely classic Disney, better than many of the films the company makes today."
3,All I wanted to do was download this movie to my laptop,"What a pain! All I wanted was to download to my laptop. Every time I clicked on info for download, I was transferred to a page with instructions to download to my Kindle Fire. I want it on my laptop!! I will NOT order another movie - either for the Kindle or the laptop."
4,He is a Magic Dragon,A blast from my past. I loved this movie as a child and am thrilled to have it as part of my adult nostalgia collection. It almost seems as if it has improved in the years since I saw it last.
4,Classic for children,The years since this movie was released have not diminished the quality of this meaningful children's tale. It was a favorite movie of my children and now my grandchildren. Our family agrees it is teaches a good lesson.
4,Pete's Dragon,"I purchased this video for my niece's birthday. It arrived in perfect condition and within the week. My kids loved it when they were growing up, and I did, too. I especially like the music and animation.Although I haven't viewed it, I am sure it is fine."
5,One my my favorite disney movies!,"This movie was one of my favorite movies growing up. And now that its remastered a bit, its fun to watch again and not as cheesy to watch in this day.. I love the songs, and my 6 year old nephew loved it as well, as I thought he might be bored not being a ""new age"" child movie with all the awesome graphics. Love Pete and Elliott! :)"
5,Masi's review,"Good Movie, I saw it as a kid and now my children enjoy it just as much. This movie with it's simple message withstood the test of time, and it will continue to please for generations to come."
5,best family classsic,This movie is one of our family's all time favorites! Great songs and wonderful characters fill the screen. This is a timeless classic that we can watch again and again.
3,Through the eyes of my grandson,"Although I still really like this movie, it couldn't hold my 7 year old grandson's interest. Every time they would start singing, he would get up and walk away. The beginning scared him a bit and he just couldn't connect with the characters."
5,Both of my grandkids love this,Mu children watched this movie when they were small and now their children are watching and enjoying it. This nevers go out of style...great movie
5,Pure Enjoyment,"I received this product in excellent condition and in a timely manner, as promised. The DVD brings back memories and happy times as well as enjoyment for those too young to have seen the movie the first time around. GOOD FAMILY MOVIE."
4,Woo-hoo! My kid likes it as much as I did!,"Yes, the animation is dated. Yes, the plot is kind of corny BUT my daughter is just as enchanted as I was (and still am). You can't miss with this one! Pete's Dragon shows you what it means to be a kid with an unbelievable (only to the grown-ups) best friend who helps you out when you think that there's no one else left to care. The songs are still catchy and the baddies are still scary. The DVD is sooooo much better than VHS; and unlike my VHS copy there is no fear of it wearing out from over-playing."
3,Minus two points for running time error,"The running time of this film is in the realm of 129 minutes, not 88 as is printed on the disc itself, the packaging, the amazon description, etc. I almost didn't buy this because of it and I don't understand how a company like Disney could make such a significant, 40 minute error. Don't you even know how long your own movie is before you have it printed right on the disc? WTF? Don't you have enough time to figure this stuff out when the movie is in the ""vault"" all that time??? As for the movie itself, you've probably seen it, a classic."
4,Loveable Pete's Dragon,"This is on of my favorite of the Disney Movies (next to Mary Poppins). The story is based around an orphan boy and his invisible/visible pet dragon, named Elliot. Jim Dale, who plays the Doc, does a wonderful job playing the part and has done several Disney movies before. He is definitely funny and so is Red Buttons, his partner. Helen Reddy sings as well in this movie (she was a favorite of my during the time of the movie). Mickey Rooney is a delight, as usual. This is one movie that is for the WHOLE family to sit together and enjoy. The movie is based in a small fishing down in Maine. The bad folks in here are the Gogans, with Shelly Winters (who is a delightful actress) being the head of the group who are coming back to claim Pete and for him to be their slave again. Elliot along with his new family are their to save him from the Gogans. Enjoy!"
3,love this movie,"bought this for my 22 year old daughter for Christmas because she loves it and wanted to share it with her step-children. The only thing I want to complain about is...the address label. It was addressed to me OR CURRENT RESIDENT. So what that says is if I didn't receive it, the person that did would have a free video. It wasn't expensive, but still in all, you should make sure the person ordering it is the one getting it - not the current resident."
2,not for kids,"unless you want your kids watching drunk brawls this movie is not for children. Very sweet trailer, but the movie is not at all sweet, certainly not for little kids and frankly not what I would want my older kids watching either. s"
4,Fantastic!,Most times a movie is not quite as good as I remembered it. I have to say that Pete's Dragon is still a feel good movie that holds your interest and leaves you smiling. Glad I finally got it in my collection to watch again and again.
1,WAIT...New dvd coming August 18th for Pete's Dragon,Disney is releasing Pete's Dragon-High Flying Edition August 18th. Finally a quality release is coming for it in only 2 1/2 months.
1,Not so good,The movie is great but the cd is defective. It keeps on getting stuck on the same spot. I'm trying to return it but I can't get any reply to my e-mails.
4,Excellent DVD with good extras and THE BEST Disney songs,"The Pete's Dragon DVD was, I believe, the first of the pre-90's Disney films to be released with some decent bonus features. Now, with the Snow White, Dumbo, and Peter Pan special editions, Disney seems to realize that extra features sell extra copies. The best extras on this disc are the 4, yes, 4 bonus programs, including a Walt-hosted television excerpt called, ""The Plausible Impossible (which the dvd case doesn't mention) and a very trippy documentary called ""Man, Monsters, And Mysteries,"" featuring the voice of Winnie the Pooh.Pete's Dragon has a fantastic cast, great choreography, and the most consistently good score of any Disney movie. I dare you to find one song, in lyrics and music, that's below par. Surprisingly, there is no soundtrack album in print.The only weakness in my view is uninspired direction. Notice the waste of visuals in ""Candle on the Water"" and you'll see what I mean."
1,Longest two hours of my life,"I understand the amazing graphics for this time period, but I advise that if you never watched this movie, don't buy it until you do! I found that this was one of the longest two hours of my life. Please don't take offense Pete's Dragon fans. So, base your opinion before you buy this!"
1,Pete's Dragon VHS,"It was filthy dirty. No matter how many times we cleaned the heads, it never had a clear picture and wasted the cleaning tape where you are supposed to use it 100 times before you throw it away."
1,Worst. Movie. For a Kid. Ever,"This was the first film I saw in the theater, and it totally freaked me out. I was 5 and oh man did this movie scare and depressed me. Never saw it again the rest of my life and will NEVER let my children see it.Thank goodness my next movie was Star Wars. Whew."
1,Mind-Numbing Drivel,"There is two hours of my life, and my childrens' lives, that we'll never get back. The plot meanders. The dialogue is insipid. The music is monotone. I watched this movie in a room with approximately 30 children. Not one of the children paid any attention to it."
4,um i liked it.,"um it was awesome as usual but i was really looking forward to seeing what that kid looked like all grown up. TOO BAD! He ONLY narrates. oh well, good thing i love this movie."
4,Preety good kids movie,"Obviously if you are an adult this movie is not going to hold as much magic for you as it once did but for a young child this movie still does its job. I remember when I first watched this one(oh I was about 7) All I wanted to see Pete do was talk to the dragon and take rides on it's back. However as I grew a little older and actually started to pay attention to the plot I wanted to see all the bad guys get what was coming to them(I was about 9 by this point).So ""Pete's Dragon"" is a good development movie it will keep the very young kids interested while teaching slightly older kids that there is such a thing as a plotParts of it are kind of dark so don't show this to extremely young kids of will scare them(or at the very least freak them out a little bit). The only thing wrong with this movie is the fundamental flaw of most kids movies too young and the kids don't see the point, too old and the kids are bored by it. Still its all worth it just hear Elliot talk."
4,Disney's Pete's Dragon as a 30 year old ...,"I first saw this movie at age 30 and thoroughly enjoyed it. Its music, humor, and charming storyline more than make up for the occasional clumsiness. It is one of our family's favorites."
5,Excellent film,"Delivery was a little slower than normal, but film was well worth the wait and came in excellent condition."
5,One of my favorites,I love this movie. This movie stands as one of my favorite Disney movies. Unlike today's cookie cutter Disney movies it doesn't promote any particular theme besides good will win over evil.
4,The last good movie musical?,"Pete's Dragon is a surprise. It is more than just an animated movie about a dragon. It is a true musical in the likes of Mary Poppins and even My Fair Lady. The songs are very memorable and well written (with the exception of Brazzle Dazzle.) The acting is over the top, but it fits very nicely with the theme of the film. The standouts are Red Buttons and Shelly Winters. The DVD transfer is excellent, however the special effects, at times, do look dated. The DVD also has a nice amount of extras. With the exception of Grease, this may be one of the last of the best live action musicals made."
4,Pete's Dragon Gold Collection DVD,"""Pete's Dragon"", is a very good film for children & adults for a couple reasons. First off, for the kids, it sends a message of friendship. Elliot's entire reason of existence in Pete's life was to help him out of trouble from his creul adopted family. For grown-up movie fans, the film offers terrific cinematography, with wonderful scenes that take place near the coast & the small town of Passamaquoaddy. The music is also very notable, it was nominated for an Oscar in 1977 as was the song ""Candle in The Water"".The Gold Collection DVD edition, includes a great Donald Duck cartoon, ""Lighthouse Keeping"", among other features. The best, however, is the featurette ""Man, Monsters, & Mysteries"" which documents the legend of the Loch Ness Monster. The monster it's self makes an comical appearance, voiced by Sterling Holloway (voice of Winnie the Pooh, Kaa The Snake, and many more Disney characters)."
5,Very Pleased,"It is a pretty old book, so it doesn't have very up-to-date information, but, for a study of the earliest history of the Commonwealth, it was an interesting read."
3,Too Small,"Craftsmanship is very nice, detail is great...however it is very small. Smaller than I expected. I would love to have this pendant about the size of a silver dollar - penny size it no big enough to show off the detail. Returning; with hopes that a larger one is made."
2,Looks like a Capital B Movie to me,I'm yet to give this a go but it looks like a great Big B movie to me..I mean check this out..It have Eric Roberts and Mark Ducosis or whatever his name is as it's major 'stars'.I managed to have about a 15 minute watch and just could not take anymore of what I was seeing.....I may give this another try in another fe months when I have nothing to do but watch paint dry or something along those lines.
