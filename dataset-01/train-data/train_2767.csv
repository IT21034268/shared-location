4,They're great.,"I really liked these pencils. I would have given them 5 stars if they came with a pencil sharpener, but they didn't. I also didn't like the fact that they were already sharpened when they got here. Besides those things I don't have any more complains."
3,Good but CARAN d'ACHE is better,I have been using Caran d'Ache an Lyra since 1985 and I can say that Prismacolor is not the same. Prismacolor is a good pencil but Caran d'Ache and Lyra are really better.
3,New item needed service after 1 week,"Purchased this shower diverter for a Kohler 3 handle faucet. The diverter fit like new, but required lubrication to function correctly. Worked fine for one week, then customer reported that they had a very weak shower flow. Removed diverter and found that the hard rubber washer on the end had actually deteriorated and dislodged into the seat. Had to remove the old washer and replace with new. $35 item ended up costing me money instead of making me money."
4,Memories of Ice,Memories of Ice I thought was the better of the first three books. Now maybe that's because I'm learning to understand the world of the Malazan Empire but what ever the case I liked it. I must have liked the first two because I read the third and plan to read the fourth. Anyway I think it's a good read and can't wait to see what happens in book four.
2,"Great story, *horrible* editing","This book picks up where the second one stopped, but refocuses on characters we haven't seen since the first book. The pasts of both the main characters and several of the races are revealed, and they are not disappointing.The reason for the low rating, and my main complaint about this book is the editing. Frankly, it is so bad I often have to re-read a paragraph several times to figure out what was being said because it lacks all punctuation, every third word is italicized, and random words are capitalized. I feel like I'm reading Facebook. If I didn't enjoying the story quite so much, I would not have been able to finish this book. Large portions of the book are almost unreadable."
5,With the rest...,"I have read alot of fantasy...and this series definitely ranks up there with the best of 'em. To be honest, the complexity of the books can be overwhelming at times but after reading it one begins to appreciate the breadth of the story and strength of the characterizations and plot. This series can be best described with perhaps one word...EPIC."
5,The best of this series by far,"In this book the author has chosen to take advantage of unifying storylines. In ALL his other books, he is reluctant or not equipped to fufill. Erikson is hyperactive in extreme, but not in this book. Erikson should see his third novel as the plan for others. Steve can get overabundant in characters and while HE may know where they are going the audience does not even have a chance to try and figure it out. I find myself skipping and reading back so much my eyeballs hurt.That doesn't make this a good read. His story does, however. As much as I would like to throw his books away because of his newbie writing...his genius keeps drawing me in.D H"
4,Really enjoying Book of the Fallen,"I enjoyed this book at least as much and probably more than the first two in the series. This is almost certainly the easiest read so far although I think the material from the first couple of books is important in being able to quickly dive in and understand this one. This book did not seem to suffer from the act three lull that the first couple did. The Deus Ex Machina was slightly better explained but leavong that bit od godly whimsy that appears to be a mainstay of the series.I think this book is the of those I've read in this series, to date. If abythong I've grown used to the challenges of reading the series abd this nook felt a bit pedestrian at times by comparison."
1,Great book... in paperback,"This book deserves five stars in my mind, in physical form. Kindle edition on the other hand earned this book the above one star, mis-types and spelling errors run rampant and detract much from the beauty of this story, at some points the paragraphs seem to end part way through, leaving you to wonder what you are missing. I can tollerate the occasional mis-type but come on, it's as if they ran a spell checker and just chose the first available word. Toc the Younger is now Toe the Younger and Morn is now Mom, those two are the most blatant and repetitive, the problem is when the subject is something the reader is less familiar with and has no way of referencing to make sure the translate and associate it right. Great book but do yourself the favor of buying the paperback else you will be lost."
1,Kindle version subpar,"With apologies to Steven Erikson, the story was good and I would rate it higher, but this review is for potential Kindle customers and the quality of the Kindle version of this story is what the rating is based on.The Kindle copy is currently 9.99, but features numerous spelling errors, varied indentations, missing italics, and so on. There were several times where I was required to pause and re-read portions of the book in order to make sense of them due to spelling errors (assuredly from transcribing). Unfortunately, this is the only copy available for the Kindle and, for some unfathomable reason, it cost more money than the previous two titles or the fourth, all of which do not suffer from the aforementioned problems. If you're eager to find out what happens in the book, I wasn't able to find an alternative (short of summaries on Wikipedia or the like), but be prepared to deal with a low quality text.Very disappointed."
2,DHCP does not return the ISP DNS servers,"The built-in DHCP server does not return the ISP DNS servers, but uses the router as the DNS server. Some programs will not work if using the router as DNS server, so you have to manually input the ISP DNS servers. It is inconvenient if you use your laptop at both work and home.My replaced D-link wired router returns the ISP DNS servers."
1,Don't buy it,"This router has been a nightmare. It won't save the settings, disconnects frequently and just plain doesn't work like it should. Spent a half hour with tech support and he said he was going to email me new firmware...He did not. This is one of the worst products I have ever used."
5,"Runs great, no problems here","I've been running with this router for several months now (bought it from Microcenter), and I've had no problems with it. This router is on the first floor, and I have good connectivity even in the 2nd floor bedroom at the other end of the house."
2,Very poor range...,"Very poor range even for home networking. Got this in a bundle with SMC wireless laptop card. In the manual for the card SMC claims 1300 feet, router 1155 feet... Signal has failed after 25 feet of space with no obstructions, and 15 feet if one wall is present. For those of you who like me hope to put the router on one floor, and use your computer on another stay away from this product!!! In addition, if you choose to use encryption, your PC will freeze... The higher the level of encryption the faster it freezes."
1,"Bad router. Slow, unstable and extremely weak signals.","Bad router. Slow, unstable and extremely weak signals. SMC had some good products, but this is definitely not one of them."
1,SMC2404WBR Barricade - HORRIBLE,"Please for the love of GOD, do not buy this router! It is the worst wireless router that I have ever purchased and used. As many other reviewers have wrote, this *POS* hangs and the generated signal is undoubtedly the weakest of its class. It is unnecessary to recommend another brand because you can't get anything worse. The only good thing about this is that it still ""runs"" even after I threw it against the wall a couple of times out of frustration!"
2,Started off ok...,"This router worked pretty well for me for the first three or four months that I had it, but I started having connectivity problems after that. I left it with my girlfriend while I was out of the country for six months but she never really got it set up right. When I got home and set it back up, I had major wireless connectivity problems - with my laptop on my desk two feet from the router, it would take five minutes for the router to assign an IP, and then it would drop the connection. I've now replaced the Barricade with a Netgear and my only complaint after three months is that secured sites sometimes have a lot of lag, which was true with the old router anyway. I thought SMC was a reputable brand but both this product and the older version my father has have been unimpressive for wireless use. I won't be buying another SMC in the future unless it's really throwaway cheap."
2,Too far out-of-range for me!,"This work was used as source material or referenced in several books that I digested recently and so via what I thought may have been divine providence, I secured a copy that unfortunately, took a long time for me to read and assimilate. The protagonist was ostensibly a facsimile of the Nazarene, whom was educated in many lands and inculcated with just about every source of spiritual acumen known at the time. Our hero was subjected to many initiations, exercises, trials and tribulations in order for him to achieve complete liberation; all of which was of course designed to parallel what Jesus may have borne. Long story short: the prose was clumsy & cluttered, the ideas plentiful but never really fleshed out and reading this piece would have been an inordinate waste of time for me except that the last 10 or 15 pages vindicated the book to a mildly satisfying degree. To quote Clara Peller: ""Where's the beef?!"" 2 meager stars for what could have been a real treat."
5,Good,Item was in the condition stated and took a little longer than usual to get but that didn't bother me at all. I'm happy with my transaction!
4,Codependecy Does Suck,I could relate to a lot of the things that were said in this book. I think that this is something I will constantly have to work on and with and was very glad to see that others understand.
1,Bad choice for victims in abusive relationships,"I found this book to present an interesting but warped point ofview. It was unsupportive of victims attempting to make sense of whathappens in verbally or physically abusive relationships. Once again,victims are told that they are the ones doing something wrong. Causing their own abuse! I can buy the bit that this is a ""Codependent Society"". But giving abusers more excuses from their responsibilities helps no one in the end. Don't buy this book. There are others which are actually helpful...."
1,"poor insulation, stainless exterior and rim only","I was very disappointed in this travel mug. It's listed as being stainless steel, but the stainless is on the exterior only. It's the worst of all worlds in that it's not really insulated very well, so the stainless exterior gets hot or cold, and the stainless rim leaves a metallic taste, yet the inside is plastic. So those wishing to have a stainless steel cup to get away from any suspected problems with plastics leaching phthalates are out of luck."
1,The Absolute Worst,"This mug has got to be the absolute worst ""travel"" mug I have ever used and I have used many. If you squeeze it too hard it bends right in your hand if your hand doesn't get burned first from the ""insulated"" stainless steel! It's more like unpolished aluminium than stainless steel. It also leaks and causes whatever you drink out of it to dribble down your chin. I would put this mug into my ""joke"" category because Farberware is making a joke out it and laughing all the way to the bank!"
1,Make it stop!!!,"I shoplifted this book back in my crazy teenage days, along with a few other ""Occult"" books. I feel bad now about not paying for these other decent books, by Cunningham and the Farrars and others, but I truly don't care for this book. I'm glad I didn't give money for it, and I am planning on getting rid of it as soon as possible. I agree, this shouldn't even be in print anymore."
1,Not A Friend of Those Who Are Wiccan,"I have both of Ms. Morrison's spell books and was very recently scanning her new Volume III to discover that she has set criteria on how you determine you are a witch. She goes on to state that ""one must stay away from those that call themselves Wiccan because they are the rudest people she has ever encountered"". I can only imagine that she has encountered resistance from Wiccans since her spells violate the Wiccan Rede due to their manipulative intent. However, I find this generalization of all Wiccan (of which I am one) to be discriminatory in nature and hardly warranted. Ms. Morrison should stick to her superficial information and leave defamation of character to the lawyers."
1,The Modern Witch's Spellbook,"I saw this book listed and was curious to see other reviews, as I myself had rather a strong reaction-actually I didn't read it that thoroughly because the general vibe of the book is nasty. If you're looking to cause serious harm to your ex-boyfiend and his bride (ie.they end up at the hospital in serious condition), fine; the author's spells are geared towards revenge and satisfaction of all manner of petty grievances.I don't believe myself that all witchcraft is wiccan, and true, not all witches are good and neither is all magic, but in terms of trying to disprove the demeaning views of patriarchy, this book does absolutely no good! No good at all! I actually threw it away after a while, I didn't want it in my house.....Just my personal opinion..."
2,"A dry, unrealistic book","This book is an unrealistic and dry piece of work, having nothing to do with the beauty of actual modern witchcraft and magick"
1,pretentious yet empty,"This leftover from 60s trash-occultism is a survey of spells and charms, mostly invented by the author, with little reference to actual occult or Witchcraft tradition. Save your money"
2,"Misspelled, Mistaken, and Misrepresented?","The cover of this book SAYS ""Book II,"" but the cover design is of a previous printing of Book I, the book I was trying to replace. The mistake was mine when I ordered this book anyway, albeit perhaps not entirely mine. The caption does say, after all, ""Modern Witch's Spellbook, Book II (Modern Witch's Spellbook)"". So which is it? AND, the Book II I received had an entirely different cover, anyway. AND it was a poor-quality printing: the cover is barely thicker than the pages and there are misspellings in the text. I'm only keeping it because I enjoy Sarah Lyddon Morrison's work. Gauged on its own merit, I'm not happy with this book at all."
2,"So-so, I've seen better","I was initially going to give this book 3 stars, but I started comparing it to some others I have read and used, and I came to the conclusion that I would have to knock it down a number. While it may not be the very worst of trashy spell-books, it sure isn't the greatest. Most of the spells in there are either too time-consuming, or require either too much money to obtain the items needed, or even masochistic tendencies on the magician's part. Most of the spells don't even work! While I say most, granted there are always some good areas to an apple ridden with worms. I've seen much worse, like books by Anne R. (not to mention names), and much better. I would suggest getting anything by Dorothy Morrison. She is wonderful!"
3,"Dated, not for Wiccans, but still interesting...","Okay, this book is really dated. She's feminist in the extreme and her views for the future of marriage and sexuality are laughable. Also, she gives tons of information on manipulative magic, and even spells on how to kill people. If she spent any time on ethics, I don't remember it. No Wiccan would perform any of these spells. It will also freak out non Craft friends and family if they pulled it off your shelf and flipped through it. However, she doesn't claim to be Wiccan, and it's just a book of dated spells, not religious philosophy. It was fun and enjoyable to read, and I got a kick out of her writing style. I also found her section on talismans and amulets to be fasinating and correct. I've had great luck with the one I tried. Pick up this book for fun, gleam the useful info out of it, and keep it out of the hands of angry or fearful people."
4,ITS OK,well i read this book and liked it but i was a teen i did like to cause my enemies to sufer in some way but as i grew older (24 now)i got into REAL wicca and not just nonsense i now think it was good book but not for practising the religion i givew it 4 stars and i truely think it is good for entertainment.
1,Make it stop... Again!!!,"I shoplifted this book also, in those wacky teenage days. And I'm still glad I didn't pay any money for it! These are bad books, these are the books that make people think all witches, pagans, druids, wiccans, all of us, are evil. Buy this book if you need kindling for your campfire."
3,wow - how things have chnaged,"I used to own a copy of this book. I found it fun and useful at the time.I was looking to order a new copy, as mine went walk-about (I assume to another who needed it more than I).Anyway - in reading these reviews, I am stunned. I see that many people not care for the book, or for the author's statements in the book; and the author herself writes a rather snippy post. Saying she was around before the Wiccan ""movement"", but not admitting that Wiccans have been practicing their religion for generations struck me as very narrow- minded.At this point, I have concluded that this book does not fit my needs at this time. I have grown in my magick, and will find something that has grown as well."
1,As if the first was not bad enough...,"Yeah, and some ""Hollywood Tradition"" Witch thought that spells for Abortions (see book I) was not bad enough, she had to go and publish another book; and this book is as offensive as the others. She has the nerve to state that Wiccans do nothing but dance naked around a fire and worship the Devil (in her introduction) yet she freely gives out some hocus-pocus rheotoric on bringing harm to others...It would not surprise me that she is nothing more than a Fundamentalist in disguise- publishing some negative books so that Wicca will continue to look bad.This is a good example of selling out to Hollywood effects ""Witchcraft"". Nothing more than a book of someone's thoughts (albeit foul and lying), trying to impose the idea that her spells WILL work, and marketing it under the name of Witchcraft...blah!"
3,Great instruction for a beginner in the arts.,I found this book to be quite simplistic in it's list of spells and their usage. The author may want to change the title to The Begginers Spellbook for modern witch's.
1,don't buy it unless you need to prop up a table,"If you want to SERIOUSLY study witchcraft and wicca, I recommend you stear clear of this book. I don't know where Morrison pulled this stuff, but she is definitely not well-studied, nor would I call her a witch. She has a complete disregard for the Rede, and most of her spells manipulate and harm others. My only question is -- why the heck is this book still in print?! Get rid of it!"
4,Pretty good overall,"Yes, this proves that all witchcraft is wiccan, but for some reason, it never really ""grabbed"" me nor caught my interest."
1,I am a Wiccan and I call myself a witch.,"Many books at there switch the word witch and Wiccan and around synonymously, (The Craft, A Witch's Book of Shadows by Raymond Buckland and Dorothy Morrison for one) so it's no wonder the terms are seen as the same. I was taught that wiccan was just a new age term for witch. As a wiccan I follow the Wiccan Rede, but since that's just another term for witch, my witchy self follows the rede too. Now, if Sarah Morrison does not follow the Rede, that a lot of witch's do follow, than maybe she should come out say she doesn't. As a ""Modern"" witch she should really discuss Wicca, since there's been some discussion that it's two different things. Maybe we need a book to confront these two terms, since we expect witch's these day to ""Do no harm""So maybe Sarah Morrisons book isn't the only book on the Craft that's helping to confuse everyone. So, if you're a wiccan but don't follow the Rede, does that make you a mean ole witch?"
1,Zilchcrap in print,"I'd rate it lower if I could, but in this book and her second volume, Ms. Morrison advocates ridiculous-sounding ""spells"" for the most inane purposes. And in volume 2 she actually has a black mass (fake) and love spells for men that include summoning all the hosts of the Xian hell to bring a particular woman to you or you'll ""sic God on them"". Sprinkling powdered bat's wing on a cop to keep from getting a speeding ticket is stupid and illegal - just don't speed!This book mentions nothing of Wicca, the Goddess/God, or anything remotely resembling modern paganism. Worthless, absolute garbage, most suitable for kindling"
2,Lord Of The Rings-The Fellowship Of The Ring,I was a little disappointed that my video skipped in a few places. The ad said that the CD was in good condition. I don't think that I will be buying anything like this again. I was wary to begin with since this was my first purchase online and I got a clunker right off the bat. BUMMER!
1,This is horrible.,"This is the book that made me stop believing in magic. See ""Modern Magick"" for the one that made me believe again. It's nothing but politics, opinions, etiquette, and a couple of spells that may or may not be useful, I wouldn't know because the projectile vomiting reaction I had to this book stopped me from reading too far into it. Save your money, and your time."
1,"AGAIN!!!, the perfect book for suckers.","HAHAHA, and i though no book could be as inaccurate as the first. I was wrong. I purchased this particular book just for a laugh. I had more than just one laugh. Again, one or two of the spells I've tried, just to be sure...worked to my amazement. However the rest did not. Don't buy this book if you want quick results. If your a beginner it will only make you not believe in magic. magic is indeed real...so...buy a book thats going to grant results for hopes, not shatter them."
1,Book One was bad... this is worse,"Not only is this book chock full of negative spells, but there is one thing Sarah says that made me laugh out loud! In her first book, Sarah carefully explains how people will tell you ""Don't hang a ""lucky"" horseshoe prongs down, or the luck will run out"" and how this statement is wrong. She says, in book 1, that you have to hang it prongs down, to recieve luck. In THIS book (#2) she states ""Make sure to hang you horseshoe prongs up, or the luck will run out!"" Maybe Sarah should read her own work! Sarah means well, but this book is sensationalist junk. Please read books by Starhawk, Buckland, Cunningham, and others, instead of this."
1,YUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"What a disgrace to the modern witch! It's books like this one that continually give us bad reputations! If you value your karma, don't even pick this book up. I ripped mine in to many pieces and burned it!"
1,The worst type of authority,"The word ""author"" is derived directly from the word ""authority"". When we read a book on a subject, we believe in the author's authority on that subject. Believing in Ms. Morrison's authority in witchcraft is likely to get one into serious karmic troubles. This woman knows not one whit of which she speaks, and yet shockingly, continues to be set up as an authority on the subject of magic and witchcraft. I suggest that the publishing company be boycotted, an action which I have taken, and shame on the booksellers for continuing to sell and promote such frightening misinformation. Ms. Morrison could single-handedly begin a new Burning Times with her drivel."
4,better than most think....,"This book is not about wicca, thank goodness, which is probably the reason so many people are having such a hard time performing the spells. I have performed several of the spells contained in this book and had a very high success rate. So while some people will say this book is not worth the money you will pay for it, I must disagree. Yes, the spells can be hard for a beginner to perform, but as with anything practice makes perfect. Concentration is the key to these spells, if you can conjure enough you can make them work. The only downfall I see with Ms.Lyddon-Morrison's book are that they can be redundant...there are several of the same types of spells throughout her series of books (some of the spells come from different religions but do the same thing). All in all, I recommend this book, and the rest of the series, to all of you witches out there."
4,Still not as bad as you guys say..,"Ok, I reviewed this book back in 1999 for Amazon, and I still have the same opinion. Here it is again: This is NOT a Wiccan book, they are NOT Wiccan spells, the author NEVER claims to be Wiccan. I've practiced Witchcraft for over 20 years so I know that this book and the spells contained in it can and do work, but you have to know what you are doing. The problem you guys are still having is blurring the line between Witchcraft and Wicca. They are not the same thing, they never have been and never will be. It really saddens me that some people who are blatant about their affiliation with Wicca don't seem to realize that it is a completely different entity from Witchcraft. So, if you are a WITCH and not a Wiccan, I really do recommend that you pick up this book, it has both the white and black parts of magick in it, but then again so does everything on Earth.. why should a book of magick be any different?"
2,I'VE HEARD ENOUGH!,"As a Pagan who is not Wiccan, it bothers me that many in the Wicca community are taking the same self-righteous attitude as Christians usually do against us. I can understand our hypersensitivity--we don't want to bring back the Burning Times, literally or figuratively--but why can't Wiccans accept that Wicca is NOT the only form of witchcraft? Why must every book about magick be an indoctrination into the principles of Wicca? That's like every book on church architecture preaching about Christ. Magick and witchcraft are much older and more varied than just Wicca, and we as Pagans have to get over our fear that if all our books aren't about ""white light"" and karmic retribution that the Christians will throw us in the fire. While I consider moral integrity important, some people scream about the Rede the same way Christians scream about hellfire and damnation. Let people read whatever they want and welcome a diversity of witchcraft and Pagan belief."
4,"Yes, the spells really do work!","I can truely state that the spells do work and sometimes too well.In the past decade, the spells assisted me in several difficult situations and allowed me to keep my sanity.A word of caution, before attempting the spells, please wear any protection amulet and perform a protection ritual as you may encounter spirits(usually the bad types). This happened to me but I am psychic and was able to rid myself of the beings.Unfortunately, the authors doesn't mention any protection spells for the practioner but this something extremly important if you are beginner.All best and remember.....what we want may not always be good for us....so choose wisely."
3,On Second Thoughts...,"About a year ago I wrote a review for this book, which appears below somewhere, saying how this book was bad etc etc... However, I have had second thoughts, talked to some friends about it, and gone back to read it again. I still believe that the book is too sexist to legitimately be in print, however nowhere in the book does Morrison actually say she is Wiccan, and so things like to Wiccan rede would not apply to her. Things like negative magic do exist, and the new age wave of recent years has tried as much as possible to cover up this fact leading to the practical destruction of good magical practice. This is because the destruction of the shadow part of our lives creates a lack of balance. The book is not as bad as I originally thought it was, but it could still have been better written."
3,It COULD have been worse,"Some of the things can be found to be legitimate. The book may not..no does not..concentrate on White, Wiccan Magic however the author does not claim it to be a WICCAN book, just a SpellBook. I, personally, have found many of the spells in here to be successful, if carried out properly. The problem that I have with it is it's limited scope."
5,good book!,"This is a good book for everyone to learn XML web service! It is very straightforward and easy to understand!When reading this book and following the instructions step by step, I learn a lot of concepts and understand the basic ideas of XML web service! After reading this book, you can read the advanced books about XML service! I really recommend this book to all of you!"
4,very good intro to web services,"I found this book very good for an intro to web servicesThis books also gives good tips to debuggin in web services which I have not found in any book. All the examples workexcept for the example which demonstrates integrated security,which is a real shame.This book took me 3 days to go through. I am very pleased withthe content.As with most books this book lacks a real world implementationat the end."
1,meat tenderizer,The Deluxe meat tenderizer by northern tools is a waste of money the meat just flatten out the meat has to be to thick for the blades to cut into the meat but it is a well made.
5,Informative,"Timicua - Yuchi - Cherokee - Tutelo - Creek - Catawba - Natchez - Seminole - Apalachee - Chitimacha - Chickasaw - Choctaw - Atakapa - Alabama - CalusaEach Southeastern people gets two pages - one large picture to color, one page of brief descriptions with smaller pictures to color. The pictures are very well done. The blurbs are informative but basic. A younger student choosing a Native American people to study can find a very good overview in this book. The pictures are detailed enough to be fascinating and worthwhile for older learners. Great resource for teachers and homeschoolers."
4,What to do if you get Colon Cancer: A Specialist's Guide,"Very helpful, straightforward guide to help one understand a potentially terrifying subject. Mainly, it helped me think of what I should be asking my doctors, and to understand both their answers and my options. A calming, useful resource. Highly recommend it to patients & family."
5,Emergency!,"I plan to watch this as soon as i can get another dvd player. the one I havew went on the fritz. I'm sure it will be nice to see these movies, and I am glad to have the complete series of Emergency! on dvd.Thank you.Janet nazer"
3,A bit of trivia,"In the 2 hour movies of ""What's a nice girl like you Doing?"", and ""The Convention"", it's interesting to see that the character of Dr. DeRoy is played by John de Lancie, who later played the re-occurring role of the arrogant villian, ""Q"" in Star Trek the Next Generation."
5,Emergency Season Seven,I can not remember the exact episodes of this season but as a young child of 10 I very much enjoyed every show that came of on Saturday night at 8 p.m. If you like watching how our medical history came about. You will enjoy how it was that we now have parametics and how hard it was for they to start out in Ca. I still enjoy watchen this show and I will alway will enjoy sitting down to watch Emergency after a long day. I will never out grow the show that turned me towards the medical field and I have never looked back. I am very much waiting for season 6 and I can hardly wait for Season 7 and all the 2 hour movies that were made after the series ended. Enjoy like I have.
2,Boring.,"I am a huge Emergency! fan and have been since I was a baby. The show came out the year I was born and I remember watching it when I was as young as 3. As far as I am concerned, The show ended with the last episode of season 6. These are not the same and some of them are poorly acted and written. The one where they first go to San Francisco was boring me to death until the boat fire in the last 20 minutes. I got it to complete my collection but it is seriously lacking in most areas. They are Poorly cast, have second rate actors, and have really bad writing along with very boring plot lines that drag on like a blade. The first 2 movies where they are in La county with the plane crash and the high rise fire are not too bad but when they go out of town it is just plain bad. Johnny and Roy are not the whole picture. All the guys from the station, the staff at the hospital, and how they worked together is what made this show special."
5,Awesome,So many memories! Gotta have this if you are an E! Fan. So much fun words just can't describe it.
5,Good,Shows how the programs got started and can learn a lot about how they risk their life to save people.
5,Great movie for Emergency! fans,Must have collection for Emergency! fans. Nice sendoff for Roy and Johnny with lots of flashbacks in the final movie.
2,Emergency! movies.,"While some of the movies are okay, the series was the best as they were varied and were well written."
2,No Johnny and Roy,Johnny and Roy do not appear in this DVD much. Big disappointment. But the rest of the DVD's are great.
1,ORDER GOING TO BE LATE LIKE LAST TIME,LAST ORDER WAS LATE GETTING HERE.THEY NEED TO START DOING SOMETHING TO IMPROVE IT.THIS WILL BE MY FINAL ORDER THIS YEAR WILL COME AGAIN NEXT YEAR
3,Emergency Fan,I always have loved this show and thought it was wonderful entertainment for the whole family. All the guys at Station 51 where terrifice which I believe is what made the show so popular. I bought the final series and was quite disappointed as the guys at Station 51 were not in it except the show on Johnny and Roy were made Captions. In fact Johnny and Roy weren't really seen a whole lot in those eposides either. It was good show but not as good as if the whole gang had been there.
2,Should've quit while they were ahead,"In all honesty, I've only watched 2 of the movies in this set so far... Greatest Rescues and Survival on Charter 220. Sadly, they were both disappointing and I'm not sure I'm going to watch the rest. The Greatest Rescues were anything but. I think they picked the most boring out of the 6 seasons, and there were a lot to pick from. I also agree with another review I read elsewhere...why not have some commentary by the stars themselves on this episode? What a missed opportunity. Universal really dropped the ball on that. Three cast members are already gone and who among us isn't getting older...? I'm a huge E! fan so for me to say what I've seen so far is lame is difficult, but I was sorely disappointed."
3,emergency the final rescues,"I have all six seasons and and am still a big fan after rediscovering Emergency on The Retro Channel. While not all that crazy about the *seventh* season which consisted of several made for television movies (with far too little of the original cast and far too many characters I cared zilch about,) I am a completetist and bought this so I'd have the complete set."
4,Local hit,"my family is in this movie so naturally I love it, recommeded for anyone in the Charlottesville area to enjoy."
1,A Waste of Money - <1 Star,"This book looks just like a compilation of the ""author's"" position trading books but with editing to put in the words ""day trading"" where ""position trading"" used to be. There's no other difference. The only potentially useful info to a newbie was about monitoring the first 30 minutes to try to determine the direction of the day. However, everyone has been doing that for years and most websites suggest it, without charging. Who doesn't know what an oscillator divergence is? That's not a system and while a valid indicator for some trading styles, is certainly not unique to day trading. Mr. Bernstein was reportedly run off tv with his infomercials that made claims the government stated he couldn't back up. Put his name in a search engine to see what others say about him. If you want to get your money's worth, read whatever Larry Williams' latest book is. He'll show you his brokerage records, Mr. Bernstein won't. 'Nuff said."
5,Strategies For The Electronic Futures Trader,"Jake Bernstein's, Strategies For The Electronic Futures Trader, is an outstanding description of 9 proven trading systems. Each system is explained in depth and in easy to understand terms. Most importantly, Jake provides the results of these proven systems. The timeliest chapter in the entire book is the chapter on how to capitalize on market volatility. Could it be any timelier? If your considering trading futures or you trade now, this book belongs in your library and the strategies should be programmed on your computer."
5,great for the beginner,I read this book before I started trading futures. I played around with a few of the concepts and since then (end 1999) have written my own trading system based on some of the theories. I have gone through a steep learning curve but have now started to make money consistently in the futures market.I would totally recommend the book for down to earth explanations on how to develop a profitable strategy.
5,Helicopter action in Vietnam,"Excellent read. You feel like you are right there with him. Semper FiAnd My Mother Danced with Chesty Puller: Adventures of a Marine in the rear, to combat in Vietnam"
5,"Enlightening, gives an understanding to the experiences of soldiers","Having never been in military, war is a foreign concept to most of us. This book sheds light on a very sensitive issue.It brings a sense of understanding to the average person. Highly recommended!"
2,Masters of the Art,"Being a retired Marine and having served in the same squadron and having the same MOS as Ron, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. I recognized several names, even though I was stationed in HMM-161 in the early '70s. I would definately recommend this book to any person interested in Marine Aviation and its real world attributes."
3,Could use some improvements,"I took this book with me when I spent a month in Europe. Although it did give lots of history of each country and a good amount of general info, there could have been more description and information about each of the individual attractions. Nevertheless, this book is for you if you don't want much background info. On the plus side, the color street and subway maps of the large cities such as Paris and London were really helpful."
5,travel bible!,"this became our travel bible over my backpacking trip, never left the hostel with out it!"
4,"Great Item, But...","The RAM itself works well. No clashes with previous hardware. My programs open more quickly and games run more smoothly. However, it was packaged very poorly and could very easily have been destroyed in shipping. After pointing this out to Amazon, they immediatley sent me a full refund of the S&H.;Thank you for your speed and your willingness to believe your customers."
4,Just as advertised,"I had thought this was the ""normal"" size bottle of idophor and was very disappointed when I received it. My fault for not reading the description. The product itself worked fine, got me through two batch of beer. Luckily, a homebrewing supply store opened not more than half a mile from me just this month. No more shipping costs for me!"
5,Good stuff,"Purchased for sanitizing glass for special bottling... it get's the job done along with a good drip-dry. Though I don't have much experience with various products, this seems like a quality job for the quantity at its price."
5,Goodyear? More like greatest CD ever made.,"Having played drums on this record, I can honestly say that it is probably the best CD ever recorded by humans. We spent over 15 years writing and perfecting each and every song.Little known fact: Amy Marino is actually a pro white-supremacy anthem.If you don't buy this CD, you will definitely die. Probably in the next 15 minutes."
4,"Quality material, easy set-up","Bought this for street/floor hockey use and was pleasantly surprised how big and sturdy the whole unit was upon set-up. Parts were labelled well and although instructions were a bit vague, it was fairly easy to set up. Once the outer frame was done the net was then draped over it and tied along the frame through loops and holes protruding from the edge of goal net. only downside is that the net is not collapsible after use, so you must take it apart if you are going to haul it away. There are a set of mini wheels located on each goal post, so it makes it easier to move the whole thing around.All in all I was happy with the purchase and i also decided to purchase an additional 1 year protection policy from Sports Authority (where I bought it) which covers everything including the net."
3,Too Snug,"These shoes look really nice but they do seem too narrow and are just too snug all the way around. I wear a size 8 medium. I will need to return them but not sure if a larger size will work as then they will be too long and still too narrow probably. My foot is wide at the toes and narrow at the heel so that in itself is an issue on most of my shoes. The shoes also feel like they slant towards the inside, which would not be good for walking very far. Even when I am just looking at them when they are not on I see how they slant inwards a little, or at least to me that is what I see."
2,A Cultural Reference Point,"I finally read this book, after feeling as if I were missing out on a cultural reference point. If you feel the same way, then go ahead and read it. However, if you're looking for something more, I believe you'll be disappointed. It's a trip inside the mind of a drug addict and although parts are funny, it's hard to overlook the despair coming from the pages."
2,"Book okay, but","This item came as a compilation of Thompson writings. Got the original ""Fear and Loathing..........."" in a reprint style hardcover. There was no book cover or cover art (which is a big deal with a Thompson book). Also, the thing had a delayed ship date of about one month. It did not arrive when promised, so about 10 days after it was due I contacted the seller, who resent it. I did get that book in about a week after that."
5,"The man, the legacy, the insanity","Anyone who has not read Hunter S. Thompson, owes it to him or herself to read at least one of his efforts. This is the perfect starting point.Often described, alternately, as a drug crazed lunatic, a brilliant writer, a humorist, a political commentator, and a popular historian; none of those titles really does justice to him as a person or his body of work.Hunter was a visionary, while associated with the counterculture of the 1960's and 70's, he is more closely related to the beat movement of the 1950's. His desire was to capture life in action, with a blend of prose and newscopy.To try to explain Fear and Loathing is impossible, its simply not about a trip to Las Vegas. Its about the American Dream, something Hunter stringly believed in, and his attempt to experience it hanging on by his fungernails. As he would say, buy the ticket... take the ride."
5,the incarnate devil,"HST is by far the most gifted writer of the 20th century. His prose is nowhere near Hemingway and his imagination will never touch the thought and reason of James Joyce, but holy schnikes, they never in a million years could have lived through the Mint 400 and the Highway patrolman, much less remembered enough to put those thoughts and impressions onto paper. For all those who bask in theglory of flower power, peace, love, and drugs, this book has shown that when you kick in the face of the 1960s, all you have left is a pair of drug-addled fiends gnashing their teeth at everything America holds dear and true. You are left with the savage brutality that our hope and glory failed and all we are with is, ""those god**mn bats"". One of the greatest books ever penned---------------------"
3,Satisfied,Wasnt exactly what I thought it was going to look like. Had different cover. Eventually was happy with the product and its looks.
5,A great compilation!,"I have read Fear and Loathing before, and find it to be a classic that is not only fun, but portrays Hunter S. Thompson's journalistic genious. For true Thompson fans, this is a great book to add to the collection not only for the story of ""Fear and Loathing"", but for his commentary as to why and how he wrote the story that is included after. I almost liked his commentary better than the story itself! Personally, I did not find the other story included quite as interesting, but it gives a good flavor of an interesting piece of history and shows off Thompson's more straightforward journalistic side. I would definitely suggest this read!"
3,Fear and Loathing,"This was a gift to my son. He had had the first edition and it was lost in a home break up. He said okay, but definitely edited."
5,Adapter ring works perfectly!,"The shipment is very fast and the quality is excellent. Very good company. Their prices are very reasonable, normally with free shipping. I have bought as many as 10 different adapter rings from Digital Goja in the last few weeks and everyone of them has worked perfectly! One got lost in the mail and they sent a replacement immediately, with no questions asked. Great company and will do business with them again and again. I highly recommend them!"
5,Historical facts. No more.,"This is a very important book for people who want to know the facts without stories of romance and chivalry. It is very well organized with chapters dedicated to all the aspects of life from the time of the Crusades, aspects ranging from the military orders in various periods of time to the evolution of crusading literature. I recommend this book for people who need an overview of the period of the Crusades. It is also advisable, in order to comprehend the whole picture of the Crusades, to read opinions from the Muslim side. A very good book in this region is ""Arab Historians of the Crusades"" (The Islamic World Series) by Francesco Gabrieli."
4,An excellent tome on the crusades to begin your historical journey!,"The Oxford Illustrated History of the Crusades introduced me to several aspects of the military campaigns and enduring influences they had which I had never been exposed. I have read other books on this topic and have learned a great deal, however, additional topics such as poetry, song and architecture were items which up until my reading of this book I had not even considered. After reading this book you will realize as perhaps as I that one has merely scratched the surface of Crusade history. I highly recommend this source if you would be interested in getting a bigger and better picture of this often misunderstood and oft-maligned period of history in western civilization."
5,YUMMY CROUTONS!!,"This brand is so hard to find anywhere in a store, so I was so happy to find it on Amazon and at a great price! These are the most delicious packaged croutons that I have had. They are really crisp and wonderfully flavored. Next to my own homemade croutons, these are the best!"
2,Didn't like,"Didn't like them at all. In addition to being tasteless, they are ""airy,"" with no substance at all. Would not purchase again."
1,This book is content poor.,"If you have any hope of organizing and administering your own workshop for gifted and talented children after reading this book, you will be very disappointed. I am a professional in the field of gifted and talented, who has found this pamphlet extremely poor in content. There are a few topic ideas, missing any relevant information. There was less than a paragraph written about any topic. One can be an expert on a particular subject, and not be an apt writer, nor a good teacher. This is an example of a case in point. Save your money."
1,Where are the names!,"How could an educated individual like Mary Webster edit out the names of the writers. It's very simple to have the name of each author along with the Fereralitst paper number. No, just the number!"
5,Book: The Federalist Papers in Modern Language,"I bought this as a supplement to (not a substitute for) the Federalist Papers in the original language. I'm reading both. The ""Modern Language"" version seems to be what it promised: a transcription, not an editorial."
3,The Federalist Papers by Mary E Webster,Amazing piece of work. The author has extensively researched and presented in as simple manner as possible. I am still wading through figuring it out but enjoying and being enlightened.
2,Not so much . . .,"I like a presentation of facts, so when an author's opinions get mixed into topics such as these, a book often turns very controversial . . . and most of the time not in a favorable way. Although this book does have some interesting information, I don't think it let's readers decide for themselves. Aside from that, there are some topics mixed in to the whole jumble where your forced to ask, ""Why is THIS in here?""I'll be returning my book soon, it was disappointing. Look for things by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, she presents facts and beliefs from all over the world . . . and lets YOU decide what to believe."
5,Great book,"A very good book for the beginner. While the lofting of the patterns can be intimidating, the author does a good job of explaning the basics. The plans and the information contained in the book are very helpful. One thing building a canoe with an inner stem can be a bit tricky, you may opt to just run the strips past the form and glue the together this works very well."
3,Great but,Don't expect to get patterns to build a canoe with this book. All of the other reviews didn't tell you this. If you want to build one of the boats mentioned in the book you have to go to the authors website and purchase them seperately for another $69. If you want to build a boat with this added cost look at getting Stripper's Guide to Canoe-Building it has full size patterns.
1,"OK, but NO PLANS!","The book is ok in terms of content and ""how-to"", but I could get all that information for free from personal blogs and youtube. The reason I bought this book is that I thought it included PLANS, which it did NOT. So for me, this book was totally useless. Ticks me off because the description on Amazon could have stated this and saved me the money.I would recommend buying Gil Gilpatricks book instead. His book has plans, and the instructions are every bit as good as this one."
4,A book that will help you build a beautiful canoe.,"I like this book. Moorse's canoes are striking, but I think that a lot of what is presented may be beyond the skill of the casual builder. It is obvious the Ted Moores is a fabulous woodworker. The problem is that I am not. I really enjoyed reading how he builds his canoes and looking at the wonderful photos that are in the book.Personally, I don't like external stems on a canoe. They widen the entry line and just look weird to me. Building them is also a fiddly undertaking and I'm not sure that they really add much. I built my canoe using both Canoecraft and Gilpatrick's book . . . I found the latter a much more approachable text.If I were a master woodworker I would only follow Moore's book and I would have the most beautiful canoe that I could build. I'm not a master woodworker so I follow Gilpatrik and I am fully satisfied.I recommed anyone that is interested in canoe building to buy this book. It is just amazing what he can do with wood."
3,"Great instructions,poor pictures",Very well written with expert instructions. The pictures illustrating points of construction and other important points are all black and white with poor quality reproduction making it hard to destingquish details.
3,Okay,"The author is very knowledgeable about the subject but she sees chickens as human beings which will be a point of view that her readers may not share. However, it is sad and unhealthy that chickens are treated so badly."
5,Arguing for a more vegetarian world,"Chickens are one of the world's most embraced food animals, but the modern handling of them could make their tasty flesh not so sweet. Now in a newly updated and expanded revised edition, ""Prisoned Chickens, Poisoned Eggs: An Inside Look at the Modern Poultry Industry"" is an exploration of how chickens are handled in today's livestock farms. Focusing on the imporatnce of animal rights as well as environmental concerns, author Karen Davis calls out the industry as cruel and wasteful, and possibly endangering the world's chicken eaters. Arguing for a more vegetarian world, ""Prisoned Chickens, Poisoned Eggs"" is an intriguing look at the world of modern chicken farming."
1,Yoohoo!?!,"I ordered this practice test booklet a month ago, and still do not have it. Perhaps my order got lost? I finally received notice of it being mailed last week, so still waiting..."
5,Sky King Vedio,Video arrived sooner then I thought. Picture quality was really good.Brought back good memories of when I was a kid
1,sadly disappointed,"well, I guess there's a reason for things going out of date! I was sadly disappointed in this choice...the quality of the movie was really bad and the contents were even worse! Live an learn....next time don't buy!"
3,Sky King:Vol 1 TV Series,"I'm sure I'm not the first to say that ""Sky King"" doesn't live up to my remembrance of it as a kid. There may not be a more annoying character then ""niece Penny"" and the stories are pretty lame but the Cessna that King flies is still a cool plane for aviation buffs."
1,Avoid this DVD!!,"The Wild Man, Sky Robbers, A Dog Named Barney and Bullet Bait are the same four episodes available on another DVD released commercially. Sadly, Alpha Video chose to take their prints and use it for their own. Alpha has a reputation for doing this, grabbing prints and films from other DVDs and then putting them out on their labels, with alterations such as superimposing their logo in the corner and freeze framing title cards. You can buy all 72 episodes on a multi-disc set, officially, licensed product on Amazon.com and get BETTER quality."
4,SkyKing,This was a gift to a co-worker who remembered watching her favorite show when she was a young girl. She has stated that she is enjoying the dvd and these were ones she had forgotten or never did see. The quality was great and the dvd came to me on time.
3,Sky King and Penny,"It is in black and white, and in retrospect the acting was downright hokey. How come we didn't realize it back then?"
5,Just So Upbeat!,"I live in Japan and have been a SMAP fan for years but this single is the one I'll guarantee you'll turn to time and again when you need an uplift. You don't need to understand a word of Japanese, these guys will just get you to smiling. If this single gets you hooked, try Vest I and II."
4,Good product,"Good product, arrived on time. Maybe just placebo effect, but I felt more energy when taking this supplement. Gave it 4 stars for quality and value, but like all supplements, difficult to know if it is really effective."
3,piano review,My niece loves this piano but it has lots of buttons and NO instructions. ridiculous. we have no idea what lots of them do as they are not self explanatory.
3,NOT HEAT PROOF,"I purchased this raingear to wear on a motorcycle and on first wear a nice big hole developed in the leg near the tailpipe. I was not aware that the heat would sear through the material, as there is no mention of this in the description. Please be aware that this suit is NOT HEAT RESISTANT! My leg didn't even touch the pipe, was just near it and still made a huge hole. The suit is waterproof, however, for bikers who ride in the weather you must protect the leg from the heat of the pipe. I've just ordered a ""Smokin Toad Heat/Repair Patch kit off the Frogg Togg site ($6.99). I am hoping this will repair my brand new suit!"
3,"Very funny, great price!",Bought this for my roommate and he loved it. It isn't very long but it is a nice abbreviated addition to a collection.
2,Terry Gilliam's Personal Best,"Extremely disappointing! Not only is there a VERY annoying ""faux"" television set illustration surrounding each and EVERY scene on the disc (a phenomena I can find NO logical explanation for), but some (all?) of my ""personal"" favorite bits are no where to be seen. Could Terry really want to leave out the Piranha Bros.? And what about those chaps with the rubber knees!? When I first heard about this disc I thought, ""finally...a collection of this brilliant animation, all together in one place!"" It is not the case. Perhaps some one other than Gilliam, madly brilliant as he is, should take on the task of doing the collection. I was not expecting to be left wanting more. I found my self rather annoyed at the end of the disc, and that is a very big shame."
1,Useless,Totally useless product. Bristles are way too soft to get dirt from under nails. Threw mine away after first use! You would do better with an old toothbrush.
4,Who the Man,"Who the man? was the question that many people asked in Earls school.Earl is a thirteen year old teen that is really tall and people cant understand him.Because people always want to fight him but he dosent like to fight.So all he does is defend him self.I because everybody thinks hes a bully,but hes really not.He is just calm and normal like everybody else.Even though everybody judge him by how he looks.Also because they explained what what was going very good.Many times it was in an action scene and they explained perfectly with perfect words that I can auctually visualize what was going on.I recommend this book to people who get judged by the way they look.It talks about things that happen in real life.This book would be good for two people to read together,so they can share opinions."
4,Book review on Who The Man,"The book Who The Man was a great book. IT's about this boy and everyone think hes a bully, but he's not. They say that because he's really big and buff. He spends more time with his dad then his other family.Some of the main characters are Earl,Bobby,and his dad.I like this book becuase it's funny how everyone thinks he's a bully but he's not that type of person that would bully little kids around,but if he was a bully he would be very mean becuase he's so big.I recommend this book to people that think they're bullys because it shows that if your'e big you don't have to be a bully."
5,Little Songs for Little Ones,this is the best book that we have for our family. I started singing it to my daughter when she was just an infant and she now loves it and sings the songs herself or to her baby brother. I have had to buy it several times for us and for friends. If you have a little one at home it is great.
2,"Too ""easy-listening"" for me","Sorry for going against the majority on this one. It's overly sweet, and completely lacking in soul. Syrupy violins, harps, a chorus going ""la-la-la"" in the background. The result is 1970's elevator music.If you're looking for purely background music, this may be a good choice."
3,Good but the TWAIN driver is missing,"It is a good machine, but the TWAIN driver is not available. So my computer guy told me that I cannot integrate it with my other software. I probably have to sell in on EBAY."
4,"works great, but sometimes missfeeds","This product seems to be a godsend for our office. We have a lot of paper, and we get more in here every day. The Scan Snap very quickly will scan both sides of the paper (faster than your average laser printer can print them out). It creats pdf files from these that are easy to move around and rename to fit your organization's organization. THe only problem that we have been having is that paper often misfeeds. It tends to pull the paper in one direction and then jams. Clearing jams is easy and quick, but it is still a bit annoying. Overall, this is a great product and I would highly recommend it for any office to help in digitizing. It also makes a great system for scanning documents to send via email."
2,never buy goggles online,"swim goggle is not something you want to buy online, unless you know for sure it fits you. i made a mistake and hope you don't."
2,Not comfortable,"They leak, fog up and the eye cups aren't big enough to sit on my face comfortably without feeling like at least one of my eyes is getting pressed on."
5,they work for me!,Goggles are very personal. I find that these are the only goggles that are consistently comfortable and that consistently don't leak or fog. I buy them in multiples and am dreading the day when speedo discontinues this line.
2,Very Disappointed,"Considering Speedo's reputation on their quality in goggles, unfortunately this pair were a total let down. The main problem that I've encountered has been with the nose strap, I cannot achieve the optimum fit. Either they are extremely tight or they let in all the water. If you are in the market skip these and go straight for the Vanquisher series, they are perfect."
2,Brushed by Cedar Living by the River: Coast Salish Figures of Power,"I probably studied at the U of Washington with this author. I also know some of the people she interviewed and go with whom she got her information. I am Coast Salish Native American and at a very early age we were taught not to talk about most of the subjects she brings out in her book. Not that it wrong, but that it could easily by misunderstood and/or misinterpreted. My view is that the author just took advantage of the people and published for whatever reason."
5,All I can say is WOW,"This Air ratchet is amazing. I occasionally get in larger vehicles in our Independent shop and I love using air tools, problem is all I had for the bigger stuff was hand power 1/2 ratchets. Not any more, I can use all of my 1/2 sockets in places I can't fit my big IR impact gun. So, instead of using an adapter on my little 3/8 MAC air ratchet or tiring myself out, I use this bad boy."
1,BUYER BEWARE,"This is a beautiful watch, however when it you wear it, the band scratches. Once worn, the seller will not accept the return, for a watch that is over $1000.00, it should not be doing this. I am very very disappointed!"
3,Michele watch,Product arrived on time and the item is as good as it advertised. Only one problem the battery died in less than 2 weeks!!This is crazy they should have checked before shipping.
3,Not very durable,"I bought three of these to supplement a collection of similar replica rifles used in a show. From a distance they look accurate enough. The rifles are lightweight and fun to use, but after three shows two of them started to split at the stock. They were great for what we needed and at a great price. If you are using it more casually then I'm sure it will last longer then ours."
1,HUGE disappointment,"I purchased this for my nephew who had put it on his wish list. I thought it was going to be fine based on the rating but it just did not work. The hammer does not have enough force to explode the cap. It doesn't work. We used the 917 caps that were recommended, I bought extras and none worked. It is a poorly designed toy. I do not recommend this to anyone. It was a big disappointment."
3,It's Alright...,"GOOD:Very longGood weightHammer action is goodLooks somewhat coolBAD:Came with easily visible scratchesGold rings on outside of barrel shift a lotOrange cap on end is annoyingOverall, this gun is pretty good, but not for over $25, I'd say. It's good if you want a semi-realistic gun that isn't very expensive. I recommend lubricating the hammer action area with WD-40 before you try to use it, the hammer will likely not come down until you do so. I don't think that the gold rings will stay on very long, as the ends are very loose. As always, the cap is very annoying and detracts from the overall quality. I'm not sure if it was the shipping, but there were many visual scratches that came with mine. It's alright for its price, but if you're looking for something realistic, then you should look for something more expensive."
1,not what I expected,"First off, The packaging was huge. I you or anyone could have fit 10-12 rifles in the box..It looked better in the picture. I was hoping it had a ramrod for more replica realism. However I did need a prop gun for a costume design. It will work. Though not entirely what was in mind.. It did arrive in a timely manner."
1,terrible product,Quality was poor and the packaging was worse. returned it for refund and re-ordered from another company. would never order from Paris again.
2,Kentucky Rifle,"The rifle looks good upon first look, then I noticed where the stock had been glued back onto the barrell, you can see a hairline fracture and can tell this item was previously BROKEN!I cant believe that you would sell someone a product that had been broken without telling .."
3,Needs better quality checking,The gun is great - bought one earlier and my son was not careful so broke it. He wanted a 2nd one. When it arrived there was an obvious gouge in the wood of the barrel and several scratches thru the paint. Had to return it. Have to return and reorder can't just exchange.
5,Awesome,"I've been frequenting Saffron Chicken since 1991 and am a huge fan of Su Mei Yu's food. The cookbook is what a cookbook should be - full of history and meaning behind cooking, appreciating the process with an amazing end result. This is not a ""fast and easy"" cookbook but one about journey. Love it!"
2,Not quite authentic,"Sawadee kha. I lived in Thailand for more than 2 years and have frequently travelled back there since, to say that I enjoy eating and cooking Thai food would be an understatement.After having gone through the book, I would say that the recipes are not quite authentic and some of the substitutions recommended are unforgivable.I agree with Mr. Stile's comment a 100% percent."
5,Cracking Thai Food - This book does it!,"This is a wonderful book on a number of levels. The author has cooked in the US for many years and so does not require impossible ingredients or use foods with strange names without explaining.The recipes are relatively simple - they do not have 37 ingredients.The recipes appear authentic - she goes back to Thailand every year and has friends and relatives there.Every recipe has extensive stories and background to go with it.The graphics are subtle and wonderful. Too bad the designer Ralph Fowler gets only a mention. But do not be mistaken this is not just another pretty/useless coffee table cookbook.This is a cookbook to sit down and read cover to cover, but also one to use extensively in the kitchen. No previous experience required."
4,Front of the Class: How Tourette Syndrome Made Me the Teacher I Never Had,"Great book! It makes you aware of so many things that people with Tourette Syndrome have to deal with! If you are a teacher, don't miss it!!! You'll be inspired to make a difference. The book is a quick read - fun, educational, and entertaining."
5,A powerful message,"Wow ! This is an incredible message for everyone, not just someone with a disability. It speaks to keeping your eye on the ball, having a dream and being resilent. The book could easily be used for motivational purposes by businesses, schools, sales people, everyone, much like ""Fish"". In addition, its an easy read."
5,So inspiring,"This was a great read. Brad is such an inspiring person. He has a great sense of humor, and is living proof that perseverence along with a sense of humor can accomplish anything. Helps to put things in perspective."
5,wonderful and much more info then the movie.,great! more info than movie. I am a teacher so that part was the most interesting to me. I also have a learning dissablity so Brad's determination is enlighting.
5,Great for teachers,"As a high school teacher, I have found this to be an invaluable tool to spark imagination in my students! While a few pages may be a little inappropriate for that level, most are wonderful. I have used it for several years and am planning to buy a copy for another teacher."
3,Warning: Contains Suggestive images and ideas...,"Watch out if you're buying for a young person, or someone who would rather not have a source of soft pornography (both written, and a few suggestive images) sitting around. There are a few good ideas/starting points, but this book is marred by occasional racy images and ideas. I could do without... could they design a version appropriate for younger audiences?4 stars for the idea and most of the content, but one less because of the fact I can't gift it to a younger person."
2,Might work for some,"It may work for some, but it most certainly did not work for me.First, I enjoy the actual idea of a writer's ""block"" but the execution didn't work as well as I would have hoped. The binding is now a little worse for wear after a week or so. Instead of getting random writing prompts, I seem to always be stumbling on the same prompts. It's probably thanks to the creasing of the binding. It's easily fixed by flipping a few pages but it's a bit of an annoyance though.I suppose my biggest problem was that I was absolutely uninspired by this small little book. If you're looking for something to spark interest in writing a short story, then I would recommend this little book, albeit keep in mind the binding. If however, you are like me and are stuck on a novel, do not expect much help.The idea is nice, cutesy and for me it did not work. Again though, if you just want to write short stories, then you may find it inspiring."
5,Hero of Dragon Quest VIII(or in my game Leon),I wasn't expecting him to be as small as he is. That aside he comes with a soldier's sword(the starting weapon in the game) and his little animal is in his pocket but can't be removed. He's poseable but not overly so i've managed to get him into every position on the box without any trouble. Overall i'm impressed just wish he were a bit bigger.
2,Dull,"This is a book written by an academic for academia. Unless that describes you, I would stay away. In general the writing style is very dry but I think the material he chooses is even worse. For example, how much really needs to be said about the increased use of vibrato in classical music? He devotes more than just a few pages to the topic. With such a wide range of topics to choose from, I would have liked to see much broader coverage. Instead we get excruciating detail on a very small number of topics.Before I gave up on the book, I realized the author probably did not set out to write a book on how technology has changed music. He more likely took his prior work and repackaged it into a book."
2,"Smaller than I thought, cheap fabric","Its unique, but even as a Husker fan I would not recommend for the price"
2,Disappointing,"Disappointing stories, sappy women & weak plots. I forced myself to finish the first two stories but couldn't continue to waste my time by the last story. The sensual scenes were nothing special, totally predictable and almost annoying. A wall-banger."
3,Alright,"The cloth is soft and it does look great but it also gives some bad wedgies and you have to keep adjusting yourself. So it is ok, and not great."
3,Pretty comfortable but a bit pricey,"These are very comfortable, but are a bit more expensive than some other brands that are equally comfortable. The fit was okay, but perhaps CK's other styles would fit better to my liking."
1,just this once,"Just this once I'm going to write a review of a film I haven't seen. Normally, I would agree that doing such a thing is absurd. But I feel compelled to do that now. Look at the price on this thing: sixty bucks. Then, look at the length: 19 minutes. That's over three dollars per minute of viewing! How could this possibly be worth the money? This is typical of a lot of educational materials made for schools. The people who buy these materials are not--for the most part--spending their own money, so they're not as careful as you or I would be about spending. The result is ridiculously overpriced products like this one. You get much better value for your money if you buy educational materials that are meant not for schools but for the general public. (PBS, History Channel, etc.)"
4,Open your dual screen for the battle adventure for the SLIMES!!,This game is one of the funnest series they have launched to the nintendo DS. This game is for all ages and very fun. You can customize your tanks with every item you can find in your quests. Besides of the fun factor an da funny story line. SAve 'em all not copying the right of pokemon xD haha. SO I recomend this game for everyone who is expecting a colorfull and adventurous and strategical minded. Buy this game and I guarantee that you will enjoy it.Hail to the slimes knights :P
3,Mediocre at best.,"I would say that this game might be fun with the under 12 crowd. But Unfortunately, I am nearly 35 years past that age. Yes, I am a gamer, but I expect to be entertained. Dragon Quest VIII was great, so I figured Rocket Slime would be fun as well. Its cute, I guess. That is about it. Very repetitive. I think I'd rather play another Pokemon game instead (So you can imagine how repetitive it must be!).Its just not my cup of tea...I bought this one at the same time I bought Phantom Hour Glass, so at least I got one good game!.After about 3 hours of Rocket slime...I just hung it up...I'll give it to my youngest daughter..She'll finish it in a day or two..I got this used...but still paid over $20.00 for it...my mistake."
4,2 games in 1,"this game if verry difficult to find, at least where i live. one of the early ds titles, its really fun, and offers 2 player options without the other person having the actual game. the tank battleing, and the adventure parts of the game are both good. I didnt like the boss music though. if you like dragon quest heroes, this game isnt for you."
5,This Album is CRUNK!,"MAN, I can't believe no one has left reviews for this album! This is Big Tuck's first album where he went Universal so the world can hear him. One thing I'd like to mention to him though, is that he needs to do ALOT more tours.... Big Tuck, Please come to Tucson Arizona with Tum Tum and Gator Main, I Promise you will sell out, alot you got to do is play a hit on the Tucson radio station and anounce your coming to Tucson. Thats probly to much to ask for but hey, at least I got your album to hold on to... As for my review, BUY THIS DAM ALBUM PEOPLE, you will NOT be disopionted. Check Out Tum Tum and Gator Main as well!"
3,Just A Thought,"Felt COMPELLED to find out what happened following the season cliffhanger of Season 12. Personally, I belive the show lost something between seasons 10 and 12. And I'm not talking about ""STARS"" Just the WHOLE focus of the show. What else can I say beyond that?"
5,The best series ever.,"The 13th season of ER is one of the best so far. I couldn't stop watching it. Every episode brought more information, and more cliffhangers. It was more than I expected, because so much more happened than I had anticipated. The series gets better with each season."
3,ER...season 13,Holds your attention even though it is far below the level of excellence of the first 10 or 11 seasons.
5,Er season 13 review,The product was in excellent condition and was recieved in timely manner. I recommend this seller to customers.
3,It's alright,Not one of my favorite seasons. The story lines a bit slow and aren't elaborated on enough. The season finale does add a shocking twist. The last episode of the season was definitely the best.
3,Teens can be inspiring,"I have read parts of it. It is inspiring to know that there are teenagers across this country who do care about themselves, their families, their schools and communities, including our sick and violent society to do something about it and make a positive difference."
1,more jump on the Columbine $$ bandwagon,"How do you rate a book that is based totally on lies? Christian ""Faith"" had absolutely nothing to do with the events of Columbine. It happened because two boys who had been ridiculed and picked on for years finally snapped. Christians were not targeted, blacks were not targeted. It's despicable that these people continue to put out these books that are nothing but lies."
1,One star is STILL too high a rating...,Blah blah blah. More midless blathering by wealthy old white men trying to defend the current power structure....not useful even as toilet paper...
5,The Best Mystery Ever,"The Seance.. Best Mystery ever made in the history of books. Roberta, Sara, and Lauren were the best charecters. Very Mysterious and adventerous. I've read many Mystery and horror and this one has to be the greatest. Mystery and horror combined it's all in one. A haunted thicket and a Seance. It screams bloody murder in the bayou.These very religous people have seen nothing like this ever. This book totally deserves the reviews its getting. This book was very ""twisty"" because you never knew Sara or Roberta would die. and Lauren would end up in the hospital."
4,Starr Reviews,"I read the Seaance in one day. It's definately a ""can't put it down book"". That is, if you like spooky mysteries, like I do. I've read other books by the author and enjoy them as well. I reccomend this book to a horror-seeking reader!"
3,Kaitlin's Review,"I liked this book because most parts were interesting and attention-grabbing. These parts made me want to read on to find out what will happen in the end. But although most of the parts were exciting to read, other parts were slow-moving and overexagerated. The middle of the book carries on and not a lot of things happen.I recommend it to people who like to read mysteries and like good endings. The end of the book was shocking and made the book worth reading. The whole time I was reading it I was guessing what was going to happen next and I'm sure if you read it you will do the same."
1,Boring,okay i had this book for a month and im trying to read ti for school. I find it boring. I read about 5 other books well iwas trying to read this one. This was not so good. But iam stuck reading it till the end. Not so good of a book..
4,Great Mystery Book,"First off, the seance was a great book. I enjoyed the great detail that Joan lowery Nixon supplied for her audience. She kept the readers on the edge of their seats. She made an uncanny murder seem like it was a great accident due to supernatural forces. If you enjoy mysteries and the depth of supernatural forces then the seance would be a great book for you to be involved with.I would recommend this book to any young teenager who is into the whole murder mystery setting and creepy occurences. If you like to figure out mysteries for yourself then this would be a great book to do so. This book shows how you cannot trust any one person in you community. This book is also for someone who likes very suspenseful scence. I highly recommend the seance for younf adults who have just started their high school lives."
5,The Seance,"I read The Seance, By Joan Lowery Nixion. This has a very good plot and explains alot about the book. I enjoyed reading this book, the characters in the story acted the same way anyone would.For once I let my imagination get carried away and I could picture every thing that happened. Anyone who likes a good mystery should read this book."
3,huh? oh hello,"In the beginning of the book, I was confused with the book because I have never read a book that started out with so much conflict. But soon, I picked it up and fully understood the book. I thought this way to start the book was very interesting. This book also does a lot of explaining before any action takes place. I sort of liked the way the action in one way and didn't like it in another way. What I liked about it was that the action takes place in all of the sudden, the thing that don't like about it is that once the action takes place, it goes away soon.When then first séance took place, I thought of this as a more of a superstitious book but I was disappointed that it wasn't a ghost, it was actually Carley's grandmother. I didn't really like the ending because the killer was someone random and I didn't catch any clues that lead to the killer. But besides that, everything else was fairly ok.oh yeah, and MERRY CHRISTMAS"
3,The Seance,"I liked this book a lot because it had a lot of suspense and it had an amazing story line. The book had good character development also, even for the minor characters. The book convinced you that each of these characters were real people, due to its amazing details. The book was amazing and I liked it a lot. I couldn't put it down and I always wanted to read more.I recommend this book to anyone from 7th grade to 11th grade. This is a good book for most teenagers because it deals with controlling guardians who try and run your life and every teenager feels like their parents are like that. It is also good because it has an element of scary and at the same time mystery and suspense. This was a really good book and I think others should read this book also."
3,The Seance Review,"If I had to recommend this book to anyone I would probaly say no. I did not like the book. The reason I did not like the book is because it's way to complicated. This book is really weird. It's about a girl who goes to a seance and all these weird thigs start to happen. I'm not going to tell you any more because if you read it you won't enjoy it. If you like weird out of the ordinary books then this is the book for you, but if you don't then don't get it."
2,Not organized,"There are alot of good tips in this book, however it is poorly organized. I felt like I was reading a church cookbook, where everyone submitted something and everything was included, even if the same thing had already been said 10 times. It is very frustrating to read."
4,Required reading for the male cruiser.,"This book tells it from a womans viewpoint.If you are planning to buy, build or outfit a yacht for cruising this book is full of tips."
4,Wide ranging and topical,"Very readable and entertaining. Clearly the work of a bird-lover. Some readers have criticized the book for the very characteristics that make it a joy to own. This book is not a ""how to"" or a guide to basic parrot care, of which there are several on the market. It is, rather, a general discussion of parrots, with more information on the parrots that are better known to the author. The photographs are wonderful, and some of the stories are quite amusing. The author began as a parrot owner during a time when not much was known about these wonderful companion birds. He is honest about his experiences, and these can help people who are new to parrot ownership now. There are not a great many books available to the parrot owner, and if one wishes to be reasonably well informed, it is advisable to read most of the available field. In doing so, this will be one of the most delightful experiences."
2,Wrong information should have been spotted.,"Although the book has interesting photos and some mildly interesting anecdotes, I found any information discredited by the fact that a full page photo of a Quaker parrot was mislabeled as a gray cheek parakeet. Although these birds have similar colors, the size is vastly different. Doesn't anyone proofread anymore?"
2,OVER PRICED CD,"I cannot believe ANYONE could give give this CD 4 and 5 stars WITHOUT ""Mad About You"". And the biggest ripoff, is you cannot get ""In Our Wildest Dreams"" (From Mannequin) anywhere. Those are my two favorite Belinda songs, and until they come up with a CD that has ""In Our Wildest Dreams"", I will stick to the single disk. Simply put this is an over priced CD."
3,Be aware that it's aluminum,"Note that this is an aluminum anode rod, which is most appropriate for softened (also called ""aggressive"") water. For other types, a magnesium rod is recommended, and is what most water heaters come with from the factory. I gave it 3 stars based solely on the inadequate description (and using the wrong photo) and have no experience with the product itself."
5,Great Product!!,This anode rod was exactly as advertised. Do not understand why anyone would spend hundreds on a anode rod while this one is available for less than 20 bucks and is solid aluminum. Would highly recommend.
2,bleh,"i guess it doesnt lie in the product description but overall i do not like the preformance at all, just get the expo ones or better yet. use a dish towel...."
2,There is a better replacement pad out there,The eraser fits perfectly into the hand unlike the Expo eraser. The pads are rather thin and are more like tissue paper then having a felt texture. The expo eraser has more of the felt like texture. But my main complaint is that it is very poorly designed. It is near impossible to take off one sheet without ripping into two or three more. I could not take the frustration and simply threw mine away. Go with the Expo eraser.
3,A little small,These were a little smaller than I had anticipated. My son seems to like playing with them because they are squishy and he can chew on them. The boats are a good quality.
4,very cute,we bought these for our grandson he loves them plays with them everytime he is in his tub very colorful and cute
5,Bathtub Trouble Solved!,"I have a 6,5 and 3 year old. My 5 and 6 year olds, especially my 5 year old, do not like to take time out of their hectic schedules and take a bath. Now, with these squirter toys, bathtub trouble solved! Everyone likes to take a bath, and sometimes even together. Thank you Bathtub Squirter people for making my life a little easier. Also, my 5 year old is a Thomas train freak, so I really really appreciate the train squirter. Thanks again, you wonderful people!"
5,My 7 month old grandson loves his boats!!,My grandson is just now realizing the fun he can have in the bathtubwith his new boats. He loves them!! Easy for him to hold and grasponto. Unique and different idea than just fish.
4,Cute,I like these toys especially the different types and colors and believe that my nephew will to during bath time. Only one wish was that the boats were a little bigger but the pouch they come in may make it easy to take when vacationing.
5,"Love, Love, Love these Boats",My 14 month old Son loves these boats. He plays with them in and out of the bath. The boats are soft and well built and water squirts out of them so easily that my son can do it. When my 5 year old Nephew comes over he always want to take a bath just so he can play with the boat.
5,Watch your baby smile whith these toys!,What a wonderful set of toys for your wee ones! The colors are bright and the size is easy for you kids to grab and they sure make bathing fun! Your child will love this!
1,"THESE BAGS ARE DEFECTIVE, NEED A REFUND!!","i PURCHASED THESE BAGS TO SHIP SMALL ITEMS IN. THE SIZE IS JUST PERFECT. BUT....THE GLUE DOESN'T WORK, I RIPPED SEVERAL TRYING TO REMOVE THE STRIP. THEY ALSO SMELL LIKE SOME TYPE OF CHEMICAL. VERY HARSH SMELL. I HAVE REQUESTED A REFUND SINCE RETURNING THEM, BUT HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET. THEY ARE ALSO VERY THIN AND CHEAPLY MADE. PLEASE SEND ME MY REFUND WHEN YOU SEE THIS REVIEW. THANK YOU!!!"
4,A Great Tell All Story,"Love and Madness is not only a titillating story of a celebrity's secret love life, it is a penetrating look into the heart of a woman who had to live with the scandal of an out-of-wedlock birth during the 1950's, when women caught in those circumstances were considered sluts. Truesdell Riehl's courageous and well-written story will remind you of how far we've come since those days, when living in a home for unwed mothers and following your heart when your head knows better were matters to be swept under the carpet and shared only in whispers and knowing smiles."
3,Use all the modern tools or stick with linear,"If you do nonlinear analyses, you must also use residual graphs. They are much better than eyeballing whether a graph is linear or eyeballing if the data seem to fit a curve.If you cannot do residual graphs, you should not use nonlinear analyses and stick with linear graphs, though even they are more dependable with the addition of a residual graph to check how well the data and equation fit. If you can do residuals, nonlinear analyses are faster, but not necessarily better in many cases. So, the reader should choose whether to use the author's method based on whether it is appropriate for their circumstances."
2,Glad its just for decoration,"I LOVE bees, and its my nicname, so when i saw this i just had to have it! I only wanted it for decorations, but when i opened my package the batteries it came with was corroded. Im just glad that i didnt have any intentions of using it because i would not be able to. its really cute though"
5,Another great book in a GREAT series,This whole series is wonderful. I highly recommend them all to any martial arts student. Very useful and enlightening!
2,Postmodern gibberish,Len Sweet usually writes more with more passion and intelligence that he evidences in this book. Snipets of insight into an eclectic alphabetized list of topics result in a whole lot of next to nothing.BUT Sweet et al still have a few fascinating things to say -- just not many.
2,B is for Bite Size,"This book gives the reader a number of bite size morsels about what to expect in the Emergent ""conversation."" Unfortunately, that's it! It is merely a very brief survey of a few aspects that the editors have chosen to bring forward. There is no detailed explanations, no arguments, just straight-forward, ""this is the way postmodern culture is and this is the way the Emerging Church should be"" paragraphs.Don't be fooled though, some of these concepts are much more thought out than you might think. On the other hand, as a previous reviewer stated, some are not. If you are looking for a description of the Emerging Church, I don't think this is the book you want. But, if you're looking for a few paragraphs about different things they find important, you might want to check this one out."
4,"Always loved the photo, but listed size not accurate",The print is nice but be advised that the image itself is not 11 by 14 it is 11X14 with a white border... the actual image is closer to 7X11(an odd size for standard mattes). I bought a frame that held an 11X14 and framed it unmatted
4,Serious Read for a Serious Musician,"You want Success through music? Read alot about the industry and stories from other musicians who have travelled the road before you have? This might help you understand further to what you need to do.I've been playing music for 8 years, with many of my releases released over Europe and in NY,USA. I'm planning the next journey and you should too. Pick up this book and enjoy the wealth of tips this book has to offer."
2,An OK book for starting out,"I returned this book after I received it. It was not for me, it is for a student of music or the new songwriter. Very basic overview."
5,Wonderful Series,"My 9 year old daughter loves this series of books. We got this one through the Scholastic book club at school and she has quickly read through 4 other My Secret Unicorn books. I would recommend reading them in order though as they make more sense that way. The text is in bigger print and the chapters are a good size for kids her age. All in all, we have enjoyed these books and highly recommend them!!"
2,Not worth it!,"I was surprised to find these in a Border's one day and that someone loved these comics enough to re-release them in volumes. I was equally surprised to find that they were in grey scale, which is such a shame. It's almost an insult to wonderful artists who colored the original books. Granted it might be what Dorkin originally wanted, but it's like Spielberg ruining ET with CGI instead of a puppet. When people revisit something, they want it the way they remember it. Granted these are just Bill & Ted comics and not some classic.What's extra ridiculous about this is that you can almost always find the original comics, near mint on E-Bay for only $35 for the whole set. Amazon sells these books for a bout $14 a piece plus shipping (if your whole order doesn't qualify for free super-saver) That can add up to about $30-$35 dollars. That's the same I paid for the entire collection, most of the books even appear unread. When you look at it that way, these two books are really not worth it."
5,the best introduction to bodybuilding to anyone,"this little book is about to teach you the reader how to select a personal trainer in the art of bodybuilding, and to tell you what you about to face, in other words what to expect and what do not to expect. a very interesting and scientific approach and explanation on vitamins\minerals\proteins,and other nutritional substances are explained in details,their roles in the body, and as a bodybuilding aid factors. but in a very essence,and interesting and understandable way.i as a orthomolecular-nutritionist that also used to train mildly with weights, can say this: it is like its name and its well recommanded!"
4,Fun for kids,"A little disappointed on the head size (like other reviews, it is smaller than most horses you buy). But my 5 year old daughter, who loves horses, really likes it so it was worth it."
3,Small,"This unicorn stick 'horse' is adorable, however the head is smaller then I expected. It is approximately 6"" across and 7"" long. For some reason I expected it to be as large as the head on the stick horse we already have which is about 10"" across and 12"" long. It is cute and my daughter will adore it, but it is smaller then expected."
1,Not pleased...,This was much smaller than expected. The stick part broke in half the first day. I highly recommend purchasing the stick horse from Melissa & Doug instead.
4,"A quick, excellent short course on effective writing.","I came across this book by accident when my boss left to take another position; he'll never see this little gem again! The authors have very effectively laid out the elements that make business writing, readable, understandable, and ultimately effective. They present several aspects of style, explain them, justify them, give good examples, and conclude with exercises to help the reader learn them.I am just an accountant, and am certainly no aspiring novelist; this book was written right at my level and improved my writing significantly. By no means will this book turn anyone into a publisher or editor, but it can help any average person become an effective writer in the every day business world, which is precisely what it was designed to do."
3,"Buddy G, non-vocal!","This is an unusual album inasmuch as Buddy doesn't sing on it. (The album cover doesn't state this anywhere.) A lot of the cuts are originals, some of them composed by Buddy himself, who merely caresses the keys - rather like on his ""From the Wrists Down"" (FTWD) album (not to my knowledge currently available on a commercial CD, I've had my LP converted). Can't say I'm particularly familiar with the backing artistes, but the group blends pretty well.The tracks are all easy-going, and I particulary liked the renditions of Jobim's 'So Danco Samba"" and Bonfa's ""Samba de Orfeo"", which are not only great tunes but show off Buddy's keyboard capabilities very well. (He's no Oscar, but then who is - except Oscar himself!)A soft and gentle album, ideal for late night listening (or other activities). Worth owning - along with FTWD, if you can get it."
3,Interesting mix of Movie Tunes,"What annoys me is soundtracks are usually music never was in the film.I can't say that about this soundtrack and if you like the movie like I did, the music captures the movie's spirit as this soundtrack does. It is all the music from the movie. It is a great mix of new artist with new tunes...it is a great jaming soundtrackIf you like the movie, get the music-you wont be disappointedBennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD"
3,Fischerspooner on JD's entrance,I love that they played Natural Disaster in this movie which is JD's intro song when he first meets Samantha.
3,anyone know????,anyone know the name of the song when he is doing all the chores around the house???
3,looking for a song not on soundtrack,"very funny movie, i agree... im tryin to figure out what song the dj is playin at the party when the milk maid shows her boobs to the fat kid. anyone? i feel like i know this song but im drawing a blank."
5,Great series...,"My three favorite shows of all time are The Twilight Zone, The Fugitive, and ER. I had already purchased every episode of TZ and The Fugitive on DVD, and had all but the last two seasons of ER on DVD. About two weeks ago, I was scanning through Amazon.com and found Season 14 of ER for about $17 and Season 15 at the regular price of $39. I decided to bite the bullet and buy both seasons. I'm not in the medical field, but I remember staying up on a Thursday night, knowing I'd be paying for it the next morning at work, just to watch this great show. My series is complete. I want to thank Amazon for making a little bit of it less expensive (similar to a medical co-payment - LOL-) and thank you for the cast and crew of this wonderful show for making medicine so friendly, yet believable."
5,ER,An added season to the greatest medical series ever. Awaiting final season to complete my collection. A must have for others.
5,ER season 14,I like this series but I missed season 14 now I can watch it at my leasure. It was a good series
2,Latin Christmas Compilation Misses the Mark,"This is a compilation CD that mostly includes performances by ensembles from America's top music schools. Four tracks list no affiliation to any music school whatsoever, and yet still somehow got themselves onto this CD. These four mystery tracks, together with five English-language tracks, make ""Universidad Navidena"" a strange choice for a CD title. In terms of content, the jazz vocal ensembles suffer from sloppy performances, awkward arrangements, and/or bad studio editing. (No telling how track #7 make it onto a commercial CD.) You'll waste time sifting through a strange mix of classical, jazz, bluesy, world beat, and overproduced pop tracks to find two or three tunes that you actually like.Very professional performances from the Cleveland Institute, USC, and the Berklee Latin Ensemble outshine all the rest, but these few quality tracks don't justify the CD purchase price."
1,waste of software,"An avenging deer sounds like a cool thing to someone like me who hates the idea of hunting. Unfortunately, this game is slow, one dimensional, and lacking in any challenge. I was wishing for a deer to come along so I'd have something to do."
3,Companion to Romanovsky's great books,"This is a short book that has some examples, several very simple, of how to find combinations. The value of the book by itself is very limited, but it compliments very well two books written by Peter Romanovsky: Chess Middlegame Combinations and Chess Middlegame Planning. These two books give the student a complete understanding on how to plan your strategy to encourage combinations to surface and then how to identify and execute these opportunities.If you read the two books by Romanovsky, then you can find some extra ideas and get some practice with this book by Bondarevskii."
2,Not for me,"If you are into formulaic writing, this will be useful. The style of this book did not work for me, I found it without depth."
4,Review: Three Rules for writing a Novel,Well written. Easy to understand. Great resourse for the creative writer. William Nobel puts together one of the best books I have come across for writing creative fiction.
4,clarification,"I got this delivered about a week ago. I would not dispute any of the other reviews - it's a good brand, it's a good quality product, remote and on-screen menu are kinda bare bones but get the job done, probably there are better out there but this one is great for the price !Note if purchasing: the unit DOES function with both DVD/R and DVD/RW but it MUST be -R or -RW...not +R or +RW. Hopes this saves you from having to pull the manual back out and dig for this info if your disks won't work.(I know it says this above, but it's important to know b/c +R or +RW will NOT work)"
2,Lack of reliability for Pioneer DVD recorders,"I purchased the similar Pioneer 310 DVD recorder at the end of last July. The unit received little use; I would estimate 30 movies and 3 recorded discs in a 12 month span. Unfortunately for me, just at the 12 month Pioneer warranty mark, the unit stopped working. When putting a dvd in, it says 'loading' for about 30 seconds, makes some strange noises, then ejects the disc. I tried a lens cleaning dvd but it would not recognize that either. I contacted Pioneer customer service and after a few emails back and forth, they stated that they would not cover the unit under warranty - I would need to ship it to them with a $70 non-refundable evaluation fee enclosed!? The unit will go in the garbage and the $70 will go toward a more reliable brand DVD recorder. Lesson learned."
3,review of DVR-231-S model,"I purchased a DVR-231-S, which shares the same owner's manual as the DVR-233-S, about a week ago. I have not used it heavily so far, but here is what I have found: the manual makes NO mention of WMA or MP3 support and I burned 5 WMA disks with different format types and brands, none of which it would play, so I do not think it plays WMA. My One-For-All universal remote, only 6 months old, does not have the new codes for this model according to OFA support and I would have to mail it in for them to upgrade. The first-time setup wizard is very easy and pretty fast. The timer-recording GUI is very easy to use and allows up to 32 programs. The recording speeds are 1,2,4,6,8,and 10 hr. Count on having to 'finalize' your recordings before playing on any older DVD player - and be sure to use 'video mode', not 'VR', which is the default. The 2-step on-screen display is functional, but very plain looking. This model does not exist on Pioneer's website as far as I can tell."
2,Know what you're getting into.,"The object of the game is basically simple. Read one of the songs on the card based on where you landed on the board and try to hum and/or use charades so that your team can guess the song. It is what it is, and if this sounds fun, then there's no reason you won't like it.THE PROBLEM is that the songs contained within, while varied, are mostly pretty old. Even those in the contemporary category go back to the 1970s. I'm 24 years old and could only recognize about 15% of the songs, rendering the game unplayable for me. In theory you can pantomime the title even if you don't know the song, but it's difficult to do this with songs like ""Hey, Jude"" and ""Theme to MASH.""My parents and grandparents on the otherhand recognized nearly everything. This would have been great for them, but not for me.So I write this as an informative review so that you'll know what kinds of songs you'll be getting. This really isn't a game kids or young adults are going to be able to play."
4,Great party game if you know classic hit songs,"We went through the cards in one day, and play this game over and over. However, the contemporary songs only go to about 1984 - so be warned, it's not easy for the under 30 crowd. We wish they would update the cards! When I received the game, it was missing the game pieces, die and timer. Customer service was pleasant and mailed them out soon enough."
1,Similar games on the market are better,"Interesting enough but there are similar games on the market that are better. Game was missing the timer, dice and game pieces so we had to improvise. Contacted seller and they wouldn't return my e-mails. Might be a manufacturer's issue. With similar games on the market I would advise not taking a chance."
4,Great Distraction,These are great when we have company. Give these one to the dog and he'll go off and enjoy it in silence. Takes 2 days for a my 20 lb. dog to finish.
2,It was alright,"It was alright and I like British movies, but it lacked in a couple areas. Every stereotype possible was in the movie on the gay team. It had its moments however, I'm just glad I didn't buy the movie."
4,There is just something magical about this film,"I love how the focus isn't just placed on one team, or a few characters. All the characters have a story to tell and they get time to shine. For this, one has to give credit to the writer/director/actor of the film, Rikki Beadle Blair. He took his time developing the story so it wasn't cliche. I only wish his staged version of this work was available for performances."
5,Wow!,"What an amazing book. For anyone for, against, or undecided about executions.It also does a great job of descibing how people become serial killers and discusses the minds of various serial murderers (including the one the author watched being executed).I thought this was a powerful book and I admire it."
2,Arresting Officer,"I was the officer who arrested Mr. Castro in 1986 just after he murdered the man in Ocala. I was present during his interview when he described the murders he committed. I look forward to reading this book (ordered 9-10-07). Bobby BoatwrightAfter reading the book I was very disapointed. The author did not rely on the facts of the case and did not research the events surrounding Castro's murders and arrest. His obvious bias manifested itself throughout the book and in my mind, made the story a fictional work centered on an actual event.Castro was a very sick man that raped and murdered and was seeking to do the same to a small male child when he was arrested. To try and create excuses for this man or justify any of his perverse crimes is sickening to me. The world is a much safer place for all of us and our children now that this man is not in it."
4,"The Serial Killer Files: The Who, What, Where, How, and Wh","This book is a cant put down type book. Things I hadn't known about various killers were in this book. This is a in debth acct of anything involving the killer, it breaks down everything for you, the different types of killers, ect. You may not read everything about a killer in the first part of the book but as you read on you are going to read more than enough on each one, even some you've never heard of, before I could finish the last couple of chapters I had gotten to the point that I couldn't read anymore about these people, the things they've done and everything was more than the human mind could absorb. I am a Christian and believe in the death penalty, as is the way God deals with this in the Old Testiment and for good reason, they can't pass on the horrible things they've done this way. After reading this book you understand no two killers are the same."
4,Wanting More,"I just can't get past this BD being just 37 minutes. Great footage, no doubt! Made even better in HD! But even knowing it's a short movie, when those closing credits roll you're like, ""That's it?! Damn."" Sure, in ""The Making of..."" you learn it's like a million dollars a minute (or something ridiculous like that) to shoot IMAX from an F/A-18 and so you can understand why the film is not longer, but still...37 minutes?"
3,An aging documentary but it's ok.,"I watched 'The Magic of Flight' after vieiwing another IMAX film titled 'The Alps' (which blew me away).It's clear that tMoF is a much older movie and this shows in all apsects of its production compared to the newer documentaries brought out by the same company on the IMAX format.This doesn't mean tMoF isn't worth a watch,especially for fans of the genre,but I think it's average at best and would only recommend this title if the price reflects this."
3,it is okay...,"This should have been named ""The Magic of Flight with the Blue Angels"". Unfortuately it is mostly about the Blue Angels, and not as much about flight in general and the magic of flying. I do think the Blue Angels are fun to watch, so this movie is still pretty good, but it did not do much for my love of flying. The reason I say this is because I was hoping for something that was more in touch with my love for flying, which is smaller aircraft, not fighter jets. Another good title for this movie would be ""the Blue Angels and the Air Show"". Unless this is what you want to see, look for another movie."
2,Magic of FLight,"After seeing the blue angles in San Francisco, dvd was disapointing very little flying scenes. A lot is history, training,..."
5,Fasten your seat belt!,"This IMAX production is not in 3-D - however, on a BluRay player and LG 60PZ550 60"" television in 2-D - you could fall out of the airplane in one of the low passes or inverted flight manuevers! Neat too, cause you don't need the glasses to view in 2-D or High Definition. The picture and sound are both superior - The only difference I noted between HD, or 2-D, and 3-D pictures is the objects aren't right in your face. Buy it at a great price on Amazon and enjoy nearly two hours of high speed flight and history too! Recommended."
4,A Must have for Aviation fans,"The background in this video on ""the blue angels"" and other video trailors make this well worth the price. Best IMAX video on the market, by far."
3,More like a glide than a jet-powered ride,"Cool movie, but I found the pace and the experience to be a bit too golf-announcer mellow. That said, it's beautiful to watch, even on a non-IMAX screen."
3,Great ! but...,great film..great images..but..it was supposed to be widescreen. And unfortunately it's only 4/3 :-(DTS is amazing.globally good picture quality but several compression problem ( on dark scenes ).watched on a 16/9 projector ( sharp xv-z 9000 ).
5,Magic of Flight,"The IMAX version of this movie was spectacular. Definately worth viewing on DVD and in the theatre. As always with IMAX films, you can expect the sound and picture to be remarkable."
5,POSTING 5 STARS TO BALANCE THE IDIOT,Beware of buying this movie if you are looking to play it in your toaster. i have not been able to get it to play at any setting. not lightly toasted. not toasted. not extra toasted. i am sure my toaster works because my bread comes out toasted in stunning 3d. i will not invest in a new toaster just to watch this movie. i asked around and was told i would have to add a bluray player and a hd tv to my toaster to get this movie to play. guess i am stuck watching toast. the disc does make for a good toast plate.
3,"This is an OK movie, but not that awesome.","I guess I just would have liked to see more acrobatics in the sky than watch space that was taken up by shots of birds. There are a LOT of shots taken from a camera underneath one of the planes so that you see the planes in formation behind it, but you also have to look at the underside of the plane instead of sky. They overdo this shot. There should be more of the airshows they do."
3,Barely OK - They Should Release FLYERS Imax Movie Instead,"The sound quality (DTS) and some of the action scenes are OK. But the rest of the movie is boring, and the sound track will make you want to vomit!This same company should release the FLYERS Imax movie, which is a story (not another boring documentary), has better action, and has one of the best sound tracks (Basil Paledouris) that has ever been written."
4,The Magic of Flight WMVHD,"I wanted to test my 1080p HDTV. Unless you have a Blue-ray, the only way to view a full HD on a 1080p TV is with a computer. This WMVHD disk plays great eventhough I have only a VGA connection (my laptop does not have a DVI connection). Resolutions and details are so life like, you have to run it to believe it. I would like more commercial movies in this format."
2,"Get anything else, trust me.","People who highly rated this have lost there minds. This must have been there first DVD. The video was the worst I have ever seen. Some sort of tinting filter was used throughout, at times masking half the screen. its similar to looking up threw a top tinted windshield. Also, this thing is boring and short. They pulled a sneaky by including the extra features as part of the total running time. The story lacked direction. The sound was good, but there was occasional ""digital distortion"" in the center channel. This happens in many DVDs when the producer disregards the dolby standard and exceeds Established levels. Your DVD player will not disregard these standards and will clip anything above for theater system protection. I heard the same in some places of Super Speedway. But it was a much better film."
4,Review of The Magic of Flight,"Documentary about becoming part of the Navy's flight team, the Thunderbirds. Beautiful footage, excellent narrative, spectacular flying. Includes an interesting clip about the making of the DVD. Very interesting. Well worth the money."
2,a fasinating topic turned boring,"it attempts to be a very short introduction to a fascinating topic,that of wrold music. however short, it is difficult to read, badly written, confusing in the scope of concepts, with a poor choice of examples. the author must be knowledgeable, but does not manage to convey good information."
1,Flexees Body Cami,This body cami rolls up after you have worn it awhile. It is not what I expected in a cami.I would not recommend it.
4,flexees are good,I purchased this bra to wear under t-shirts and sweaters to provide a smooth line. Great look and nice comfortable material. the torso does rise up a little during the day unless tucked into pants.
4,"Flexees One Fabulous Body Cami, Body Beige, 38 B","I am glad I bought this bra-cami for the following reasons: The bra gives me definition, the cami smoothes my waistline, and it is long enough to tuck into my panties, pantihose or girdle. The cami is slippery and thin, so if someone touches my back the fabric isn't noticeable. One criticism I have is that sometimes the bra area shifts a bit and I have to readjust it. Not a big problem."
3,great product wrong size,"I love this body cami; 2nd one that I've ordered. Problem w/this 2nd purchase, it was not a 38C. The cami part was fine, but the cup was not a C, it was a B. Unfortunately, the label said C, so I couldn't send it back to amazon. Apparently, the manufacturer put the wrong tag on it. Since I have 2 other flexee cami's I know how this product wears, and I know my bust size; this is unfortuante."
4,Works great to cover up back fat,"I really love this body cami. I only gave it 4 stars because it could be longer. It tends to climb up around the middle and if it were a bit longer I don't think it would do that. But it really works for the back fat. It doesn't hold in the tummy, so don't buy it for tummy control. I can't stand to have things too tight in the tummy area, so I was pleased with that. Overall, I'm really happy with it and will be buying more."
3,Easy listening.,This soundtrack was pretty mellow and easy going. I originally purchased this CD for a catchy tune I heard in the movie but I noticed that particular song and some others were left off of this so I was a little disappointed.
1,Control did not last one season,We live in southern california and made limited use of the electronic blanket. The control for one side stopped working before the end of the first season.
4,Poignant and relevant to a mom with two NY teenagers,"This a light and wonderful read - especially if you have experienced any significant part of the world about which Trillin writes - be it the mysteries, nuances, surprises and joys of being a connected parent - or the delightful pleasures of real New York City neighborhood living - and, even if you have missed those things, Trillin wings you lightly along on his entertaining personal flight - great literature, no - highly enjoyable, yes."
2,Wrong Audience,"I like where Trillin is going with this, but it just didn't do much for me. As a twenty-something recent college grad, I could relate more with Trillin's daughters than with him.I sort of stumbled across this book and thought it looked like a fun read (I thought that it was going to be more of a novel than a memoir about him raising his children). I was not familiar with Trillin before reading this book (knew nothing of ""Alice"" and had never read his ""tummy trilogy""), and I felt a little out of the loop, since this has more of an autobiographical feel and he makes several references to his past works.The book has a light feel, isn't difficult to read, but I recommend it for audiences who perhaps have raised children and seen them leave the nest or for those who are familiar with Mr. Trillin's other writings."
4,We need more Family Men,Trillin is terrific and I only wish I had had a husband like him. I am moving on to his other books as soon as I can get them.
1,A cut and paste job.,"I was a big fan of Trillin's earlier light humor (the tummy trilogy, etc.). But this book was a huge disappointment. It is largely a cut and paste of his earlier books. The same old stories get rehashed--in fact, he even goes so far as to extensively quote from the old stories. About the only thing new here is that his secularist left-liberal biases against Christians and conservatives show through more clearly. Go buy the tummy trilogy books or Travels with Alice and give this one a pass."
2,Family Man was like a 180 page Christmas letter,"A letdown. I've enjoyed Calvin Trillin's writing over the years and looked forward to reading his latest book. Unfortunately, Family Man reminded me of one of those multi-page Christmas letters that we receive, with a cringe, from our better relatives. This series of anecdotes comes across as one long euphemism for family life. The writing is unrevealing and self-amused, containing the kind of witty, but shallow, stories you might expect to hear at a light social gathering. His wife, Alice, comes across as a dour, controlling presence; his children are anonymous to the point of being interchangeable. I have a tremendous respect for Trillin as a writer, but this book seemed empty, as if Trillin were unable or unwilling to really share meaningful revelations about his family life."
5,Fantastic,"Proverbial Wisdom is excelent. One of the best games I've ever played. We had so much fun. We even learned some history too. Who knew what some of these saying I've used for years actually meant and where they came from? It's a terrific game. Wisdom is a perfect tite to describe the creation of this unique game. I can't wait to play it with my family and friends again. ""Home is where the heart is"" (a proverb). Bring this one home to enjoy."
1,I don't want to be overly negative but - this game sucks,"I am shocked at the high rating that this game got. Me and my girlfriend bought this game for 3 dollars (brand new and sealed) at a local store's going out of business sale. The game was fun and got us laughing but in a very strange way - IT WAS THE DUMBEST MOST ANNOYING AND UNFUN GAME WE EVER PLAYED. It was so bad that we laughed for the first 2 times we played it and the third time, we were so incredulous that one of our friends liked it, we had her take it home with her. A few things to say about the actual game:1. Nobody likes proverbs2. Many of the proverbs nobody has ever heard of3. Most of the questions were really ridiculously easy4. There is no way anyone who is not an artist could sketch a tough proverb in the time they give you (it ends up being a game of charades or taboo or pictionary - all much better games)Maybe I'm completely off, but my recomendation is STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE"
5,Additional silverware,Item arrived just as described and looks just like the 'full price' version we got as a wedding gift! No complaints on this end.
2,Wild Ride,"Sherry Rogers probably has some nuggets of information in this mess of a book. She apparently doesn't work with an editor, and writing simple declarative sentences is not her strong suit. The book isn't indexed, she gives so many suggestions for patented products to use, but never summarizes at the end of chapters. She repeats herself endlessly. But you really have to dig for specific information, take notes or something. None of the reviewers of this book reported actually applying her suggestions and benefiting from them, so we have no way of knowing if the stuff works. She also seems to suggest that religious faith is a requirement for her guidelines to work, along with somehow dumping any negative emotional patterns you may have. People seem to be impressed that she has an M.D. degree and cites references. She's also a macrobiotics advocate, which is fine, but macrobioticists usually indicate that you can recover from your chronic problems by simply following the diet."
5,We have given this book to over a dozen friends & family,"Do not underestimate the significance of Dr. Rogers' book. She references over 50 pages of medical studies at the back of the book, yet it is easy to read and understand. Cancer, diabetes, heart disease, fibromyalgia etc. are ALL preventable contrary to what the medical profession says. Think about all of the money at stake in keeping people sick and on medications. There is relatively little money in getting and keeping people healthy. Take resposibility for your own health and follow the guidelines in her book - Dr. Rogers is passionate, straight forward and bang on. Buy this book for yourself, give it to those you love."
4,Witchhunt?,"Is this a witchhunt on the part of the pharma industry or medical establishment:[..]Reminds me of the case of the (female) ob-gyn in Austria who had the wisdom to let premies snuggle against their parents rather than (often die) trying to survive in an incubator and who subsequently lost her license to practice.""Detoxify or Die"" may well explain the underlying causes of a lot of the pain and grief many people, especially in Western cultures, needlessly suffer from..... (don't end a sentence with ""from""). Read the book and make up your own mind. Also consider checking out the free on-line safe cosmetics database. If you cannot safely eat it, and if you cannot correctly pronounce the synthetic chemical ""ingredients"", why smear it on your skin, your largest and most absorptive organ?"
3,"Half Good, Half.. Crazy","If you're buying the book, chances are you've already researched a good deal into detoxification for one reason or another and probably already know many of the good things. What I don't get is why people in this field continue to tout several elements of detoxification which don't work or are entirely fake like ionized water. Just makes people think all of it is fake, when we all know that's not the case."
4,Good Info,Informative and well written. Comprehensive information on improving your health. Well worth the money and the time taken to read it.
2,Not satisfied,"Did not like the book, only synthetic vitamins/minerals is what the author advised.I prefer to stick with natural Supplements what I buy at the local health food store. I did not give the book a high rating as I am bit disappointed with this purchase."
1,quack,"Dr. Rogers had her New York medical license removed for malpractice in 1999. She writes crazy books for a living. Makes millions now...losing that license was a good money maker for this quack. She kept expired drugs for years even after being warned, gave expired meds (not homeopathic meds...cortisones, cardiac meds and emergency drugs like epinephrine were outdated, she was only in her office 6 days a month and let an untrained staff person (not an RN, LPN or even medical assistant but an uneducated secretary pretend to be a nurse and give these outdated injections). Her records are available online and are NOT contested by Sherry Rogers and can be viewed on Quackwatch and also confirmed by checking with the NY board of medicine. BEWARE!!!From a New York Registered Nurse who knows."
1,Welcome to Scientology!,"If you love L. Ron Hubbard ""Clear Body Clear Mind"" or any scientology book, you'll love this one. For the rest of us, move along. For those of you confused about what ""Scientology"" is, one place to start is ""The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power,"" Time, May 6, 1991."
5,BUY THIS BOOK!!,Finally! Someone who gets it and is not afraid to tell it like it is!!Easy to read and to the point! You are missing out if you do not buy this book! I'm going thru detox (DMPS) -yes those silver fillings ARE poison! I plan on buying a sauna in the near future as well!! This book gets a constellation of stars - not just 5.
5,The mother of all airplane books,"This book is arguably the most famous one written by noted aviator and writer, Ernie Gann. It was made into an oscar nominated movie and the theme song won the oscar that year (1955). Once you've read the book or seen the movie, you realize where all of the other aviation epics (realistic movies, spoofs or unintentional spoofs like the Airport series) got all of their ideas. Due to ownership disputes, the movie is not available anymore. If anyone out there has a homemade copy, let me know"
4,"Before the movie, there was the book","This 342-page novel, (reviewed in a 1953 Book-of-the-Month-Club edition), reads almost like a fleshed-out screenplay of the famous 1954 movie version. This isn't too surprising since the novelist, Ernest K. Gann, also adapted his work for the screen. About the only major change in the two versions comes in the form of Toby, the 7-year-old boy passenger who only appears in the movie. (Perhaps he was added to provide a part for the real-life son of the movie's director, William Wellman.) Just as the movie is great entertainment, rather than great cinema, so too is the book a great read, rather than great literature. Gann's prose is smooth and readable, without being too ""glossy,"" and it neatly balances the suspense-in-the-sky plot with brief ""back stories"" on each of the passengers and crew. Gann also provides many now-nostalgic glimpses of what commercial aviation was like back in the 1950s, when flying still had a touch of glamour and romance."
3,Non-fiction is better,"I first read Fate is the Hunter, loved it...then Twilight for the God's...pretty good. Then Song of the Sirens, another home run. Then I read H&M....sigh. Gann should stick to non-fiction, I think, his novels are, IMO, amatuerish, and I hate to say so, because I admire Gann greatly, a pioneet pilot, an adventurer sailor...just what I would like to be but aren't. But his 2 non-fictions are so much better than his novels, and I have to say so even if I don't want to. If you are simply a die hard fan of E.G.,(as I am) by all means buy the book and enjoy; but if time is precious, and money, and can only be spent on the best, then H&M is a pass."
5,Fantastic for ball-obsessed short face breeds,This ball is tougher than the Holee-roller made by the same company. The style is perft for ball-obsessed dogs - allows easy breathing while holding the ball. Holds up for tug-o-war games between dogs. Easy to fling using a finger in one of the holes. Best ball all around for my dogs!
2,Great teaser,"The idea and presentation by Iomega was great. However, there's been too many failures to make further purchases worthwhile"
2,Iomega Zip 750MB Drive,"The days of ""750MB"" has gone. Only reason I bought this was to retrieve my archival datas stored in the 750MB cartridges. After that it is useless. It's the time for the memory size of ""GBs"" and ""TBs."""
3,vinpocetine,i heard about in on Dr.Oz and thought i would try it.I'm not sure if it is worthwhile or not at this time.
4,Cliff Richard in Portugal,"cliff Richard in Portugal was an excellent DVD presenting Cliff's entertainment skills as well as presenting his activities as a vineyard and winery owner in the south of Portugal.I was a little surprised to discover that the DVD ""Cliff Richard in Portugal"" is the same content as ""On The Beach with Cliff Richard."" I have both."
2,Least favorite Epicuren product.,I purchased this expecting it to be a cleansing gel that is used with water. It is not. This is a gel but not to be used with water. I love Epicuren products but I am not impressed by this one - at all. I used it once and it did not remove all of my eye makeup as easily as it states (and I don't put on much eye makeup at all). Nowhere in the description does it state it is not an actual cleanser. I prefer makeup removers that are used with water - this was a waste of my money.
2,Beware! Band is not the color pictured!,"I like the look of this watch, but not the band. I was expecting a gold/cream colored band as pictured, but what I got was a shiny, metallic-looking gold leather band that looks like a Hollywood wanna-be. I plan to return it to Amazon & ask for the band pictured. Other than that, the numbers are easily readable & I like the face of the watch itself. However, I have not worn it since I plan to return it."
2,Cheap looking watch,"I purchased this at the goldbox price and was a little suprprised by how cheesy the band is. I have yet to wear it, because it reminds me of some of the really bad pants that people wore in the 80's."
3,Confusing but good,"As a big fan of both of P.N. Elrod's vampire series (Jack Fleming and Jonathan Barrett), I couldn't wait to read this one. Admittedly, it is tough to write a 5th book in the series without upsetting someone, but I wish she had provided more background information. I have read the others in the series, but not recently enough to remember who was who. It's different to read a novel set in the 1930's, but I often got lost with the terminology. Still an enjoyable read for fans of the series."
1,Garbage,"A Chill in the Blood is GARBAGE. I love vampire novels as well as detective stories. I never would've thought it possible that an author could combine two of my favorite genres into such a rotten book. Some other review referred to this as a ""hard-boiled"" detective novel. Nonsense. I have never, EVER, read about such a wishy-washy private eye. This guy, our ""hero"" spends half his time getting beaten up and the other half whining about his ethical problems about using his vampiric abilities to defend himself. Hard-boiled? Maybe if the reader is 9 years old. The plot is half-baked and transparent. It occurs to me that perhaps the reason the ""hero"" is such a wimp is because an individual with any courage or strength would've brought the story to a close in about 25 pages.Don't waste your time. You want hard-boiled? Read L.A. Confidential or Altered Carbon. You want vampires? Read Salem's Lot, The Vampire Chronicles, or Dracula. But avoid this turkey like the plague."
1,Avoid at all costs,"This book defies description, it so bad. The dialogue is trite, the characters shallow, and the writing amateur. Sorry, Elrod, maybe you should go back to your day job.I'm ashamed I have bought all of Elrod's book on the advice of another author at Uncommon Con in Dallas/Fort Worth last year. I'm beginning to think she was in cahoots with Elrod to sell books for each other."
3,7 Vampire Files Novels and Counting,"CHILL IN THE BLOOD is the seventh installment of the Vampire Files. While it too is rather repetitive because it uses the same plot devices as the previous stories, it does have some redeeming qualities.Once again Jack is in a fight with the mob and goes through all kinds of physical abuse. I think in every story so far his head is smashed in by somebody. But at least here we get some more insight on some mobsters Jack befriends, like Shoe Colefield, the black mobster on that side of town. And Bobbi, Jack's lady friend, is always fun to be around.Not the best of the Vampire Files by far, but not a total waste of time either."
3,Deus ex vampire,"The series has been fun, all of 'em Good Light Reads, but I find the throwaway characters unconvincing- if a new character is introduced with a sketchy background, rest assured that he is a ""red shirt"" type that won't make it to the end of the book alive. I also find the ""Agathie Christie"" style of last minute rescue by preposterous means a tad annoying.The most recent installment, The Dark Sleep, drops a complete subplot into the middle of the book with a mighty thud. Elrod is a good writer, a fun storyteller, but her plots need work."
5,Great customer service!,"I had a Lund snap-on tonneau cover that I bought about 7 years ago for my Dakota short bed. After all those years of use, the cover started tearing along one of the seams, so I checked around for a new one. The model I had was discontinued and I called Lund to see if they had one left over I could buy. Since I still had the receipt for the old cover, they told me not to worry, there's a life time warranty and they'd just send me the new model for free. A completely new cover with rails arrived in the mail a few days later.The cover is easy to install, except the buttons can be sort of a pain to button down sometimes. But it is definitely a durable product at what seems like a reasonable price. The fact that they actually stand by their life time warranty makes it a great buy."
5,Fit Or Fat Woman,"Covert Bailey speaks our language in his book. He also speaks bottom line. If you eat fat, you will be fat. I bought this book a while ago and felt I needed a push back to reality after reading all the other books (low carbs/high protein, blood type etc.) that just aren't for me. I gained weight. Its not going to happen over night with some crazy diet. We have to exercise for the rest of our lives. If you are looking for an easy way out, this isn't the book for you. But, if you are looking for the truth about how we as women are going to stay healthy and in shape, then I highly recommend you read this book. Get a buddy and start moving. I decided after turning 40 that now my happy hour hang out is at the gym!"
3,"Jakes is still one of the best, however, this one is not great....","I am a huge fan of john jakes, and a big fan of newport, but this book just doesn't really take off. some good stuff, but basically flat...."
3,John Jakes Decline,"As a big fan of John Jakes' many books, I found this a good look at Newport's early history. However, the story (as well as ""Charleston"" & ""Savannah) was a rather sketchy ""hurry up & finish this"", not like his earlier great historical novels. I am disappointed that Jakes has abandoned his practice of fleshing out his characters & plots - surely at this stage in his life, he can't be that much of a hurry."
3,Games of the VERY RICH,"The late 19th Century in America was the age of the Robber Barons, enormous personal wealth, wildly conspicuous consumption, and social climbing as blood sport. Jakes gives us a taste of the times with the story centered upon tycoon Sam Driver who seeks to realize his dream of being accepted by Newport ""Society"" by using his beautiful daughter to gain access to that society. The books historical detail is, as usual with Jakes, accurate and informative. The underlying story though was a bit uninteresting with characters difficult to get interested in. A decent read, but no more."
2,Dissapointed,"I though the first part of the book was fair to poor, and the second part fair to good;hense the two stars. Overall it was trite and predictable and very disapointing from someone of JJ's statue. It certainly is of no historical value or enrichment to the reader."
2,Loses steam,"Mr. Jakes has been called a master of historical fiction because of his attention to detail. In this novel the details of the late 1800's are there and you do capture the sense and feeling of the times, but the characters are so shallow!And you find out the fate of the protagonists in five lines in an afterword! Mr. Jakes runs out of steam. This is the first of his novels that I read and I'm disapointed."
4,Historical fiction,"I think I may have read everything that John Jakes has written--I started years ago reading North & South and have just kept reading his books over time. I only get to read a few pages at a time usually as I wait for something or someone or go on a trip, but I can stop wherever I am and there is no problem to pick up the story from there. I love historical fiction and Mr. Jakes does a fine job."
3,The gods of newport,Have read majority of john Jakes. This was a little short of what I'm used to with this author'. OK story.
5,A Must-Have for Any Choral Enthusiast,"These are simply great choral works -- intriguing texts, compelling music, effective accompaniment. Who wouldn't want ""Crossing the Bar"" sung at their funeral? How could any communion moment be more intimate and transcendent without ""Bread of the World?"" In addition, as another review makes clear, this disc is ""worthy."" It contains recording premieres, opens a window into this genius's development and benefits from Gregg Smith and his singers, who know Ives choral works better than anyone. So these are collectible performances too. But in the end, I come back to the melody; Ives' masterful merging of text and tune and his inspired idiomatic choral rendering. These are deeply felt compositions, sung and played with a skill and honest conviction that even the irascible Ives would appreciate."
5,Amazing!,"This product helped me to get rid of a nasy intestinal candida yeast infection. Actually, it was systemic and all through my body. I took it because of my holistic doctor recommended it, and also I read a review by a man on the iherb website, who gave it to his wife for cancer and she was cured of cancer by taking ten pau d arco capsules per day. After one year of taking the pau d arco she was tested again and got a clean bill of health. I had heard about pau d arco's ability to fight cancer, and this was a great testimony to read."
5,I think it's a winner,"I purchased the Pau D'Arco because I read that it is good for being good for the immune system. With a daughter battling leukemia, it is important for our family to stay as healthy as possible so we don't ""share"" any bad stuff with her. I don't feel different after taking the Pau D'Arco, but I did avoid a stomach bug that my husband had (typically I would be the one who would've picked something up, not him). Now he is taking it too."
1,Yuck!,"These pills made me nauseous. I fully encourage people to look elsewhere for Pau d'Arco side effects. I was feeling sick all of the time until I realized that I had just introduced these babies into my daily supplements. I did a little research, stopped taking them, and no more constant nausea. I really thought there was something wrong with me for a while."
4,Welcome Sleep,"I came across this accidentally when I was looking for something to help with my dog's itching ear. I read about this and decided i would start taking it and after 5 years of not being able to sleep because of neuropathy, I am finally sleeping. It doesn't really help with the pain but the sleep comes and it's not a groggy sleep nor do you get sleepy after taking it. I wasn't sure it was the Pau d'Arco but now when I don't take it, I don't sleep. Good thing I'm retired because I was sleeping way too much but it felt so good to get good sleep. Not sure of any other positive effects at this time but I can tell you it helped my dog too. She had a yeast infection so I put this in her food and clean the ear with liquid Pau d'Arco and this has cleared it up."
4,An unhappy family,"Sony Armstrong is greedy, dishonest, a philanderer, a social climber, and a generally unpleasant person. His wife Gladys, who is better born, is dim, and more than a little superstitous. Their son Rohan the subject of the second part of the trilogy is self indulgent, and pays for it. The daughter Genetha the subject of the third part of the trilogy takes after her mother, but with everything amplified. All together you would avoid these people if you ever met them. Having said that, the novel does present a picture of British Guiana in the 1920's-1940's with all it's colonial and class related problems, which I found of great interest, and which I believe to be accurate. Having grown up in BG during that period, I was more than a little curious to read how someone else saw life there. I was not disappointed. Roy Heath did a fine job, I'm just sorry he didn't include a character that you could maybe like."
2,Nice coffee table book but not much substance,"I think this is a lovely little book, particularly the drawings! This makes a nice coffee table book or one to kind of skim through. But if you're in search of serious information regarding traditions and wisdom, you'd do better to find a book with more substance. Pam England's book Birthing From Within, for example, not only provides many of the same suggestions for rituals, it also provides a lot of great information to help prepare one for labor. A book that looks at current infant-rearing traditions in different cultures is Meredith Small's Our babies Ourselves: how biology and culture shape the way we parent. Small's book is fabulous- gives you a lot to think about in terms of how cultural beliefs influence our values and parenting choices."
2,Scant information on crime or life,"As the second reviewer said, there is little mystery about this book as the actual crime takes up perhaps eight entire pages of 220. Other reviewers have said, however, that it was nice to have so much information about ordinary life in victorian London. I have to say that I was not much impressed. Most of the information was extremely basic and some merely based on the author's conjecture or reliance upon popular historical theory. The book itself was not terrible but not quite what I felt was advertised."
5,Custom made of Sony Ericsson W810i,"I had this case for one week so far, the swivel clip looks durable so far, I can answer my calls and take a picture while the phone is inside the case.I can charge my phone without taking the case out."
4,Best case for wi810,"After looking at different cases both, online and in stores, I finally settled on this case. I think this is the best case for the Sony-Ericsson wi810 phone. I've had it for more than a month now and have not had any problems so far."
1,Not very sturdy,"Maybe it was my own fault but I had this thing 3 days and bent over to get into my car and the leather separated from the little plastic piece that protrudes from the back that connects to the belt clip. So now I can't wear it on my belt, I can only use the case for what it is sans the belt clip."
4,Valuable Biographical information on the Bach family,"The Bach family, perhaps Germany's most illustrious musical name, included an amazing variety of musicians. With chapters on most of the major Bach composers, I found the chapters on J.S. Bach, C.P.E. Bach and W.F. Bach especially interesting.There are also some valuable biographies of earlier Bach's such as Johann Christoph Bach, a contemporary with Pachabel and Johann Michael Bach, the father-in-law of Johann Sebastion.With each composer, a comprehensive list is provided of the extant as well as compositions known to have been composed but are apparently lost.Anyone wanting to understand music in Germany during the baroque era will want to check out this book."
4,Has worked flawlessly.,"Bought this unit from Amazon about 6 years ago, and it has performed flawlessly. It has helped me immensely it my weight-loss efforts.No complaints."
3,Go for the newer model,I've used Escali scales for years. Recently I found a newer model that is even better. Scales have a 5 year warranty and Escali acutually honors it. I will continue to use these scales! I have posted a link to the newer scale!Escali 136DK Alimento Stainless-Steel Top Scale
3,"Interesting material, boring writing.","Subject matter is interesting, but somehow, this author almost succeeds in making it boring. It seems that she wants the reader to connect with her, and worship her, but never really accomplishes either. Her supposed brilliance is never established.At some point, her kids and husband make their way into the chapters. It feels disconnected, like an editor said, ""we need to humanize you, we'll add stuff about your kids"". Instead of establishing a connection with the reader, she comes off more as an absentee parent.I was hoping for something as enthralling as The Hot Zone or at least as interesting as Lab 257."
5,loved this book!,"The book was cheap, quickly shipped and really good. I am glad I purchased it! Nothing bad to say!Thanks."
5,The Chewber delivers!,"Our lab mix has yet to make a mark on this toy, and it has proven to be even more durable than the red kong toys. He loves to use it as a tug toy, and loves to retrieve it. Since it is flexible, dogs can pick it up, even on a flat surface, unlike hard frisbees. And it makes a great water dish on hikes. Overall, one of our best dog toy investments."
5,Personal Trainer In A Book!,"UCLA uses this book as a text book for one of their classes. Simply written, phenomenal information on Exercise description, Sequencing, Rest Intervals, Work Out Scheduling, Etc.... Highly recommend it for someone who doesn't want to guess what workout to do."
4,More that a workout plan,This book is divided into three different parts. The first is a short explanation of the theory of body mechanics. The second is a long section with many of the exercises described. The third is several workout plans based on level of expertise and purpose. Altogether this book makes a helpful workout companion.
3,Fair,"The HFL company is made primarily for bodybuilders. Notpowerlifters or martial artists. Their books may have sections withspecial exercises for martial artists, they aren't that good. If you are a bodybuiler than this book is for you. Even still the book is not complete. It only covers how to exercise certain muscles. The biceps, triceps, deltiod, hamstrings, quadriceps, and back muscles. Thats it. You have to buy a seperate book for the calves, one for the forearms, one for the rotater cuffs, one for the neck and traps, so you getting ripped off. But however if you are rich enough to spend alot of money on books, go ahead."
5,Brialliant,"Dr. Marcus is one of the great psychiatrists of our time. His book covers a difficult subject in a way that bridges psychology and neuropsychiatry. The result is an invaluable, deeply humane clinical text"
1,how embarassing!,"I ordered three of this game...When my kids opened theirs on...we found that the shell is made of flimsy, easily crackable moldedplastic sheeting with a cardboard box TAPED underneath to hold the mechanics. Body parts were missing and one was duplicated (but didn't fit in any of the 'missing' slots).We set up this game and found the alien scream to be as weak and flimsy as the board, not at all the jolting deterrent noise one expects from the original Operation game upon which this appears to be based. My older daughter turned to me wailing, _But Mom, we GAVE this to X and X..... it's junk_.She was embarassed and later asked if we might get each of those classmates another small gift to make up for NOT KNOWING.Buy the original, folks."
3,Just 'Operation' with an Alien,"Alien Autopsy promised to be a pretty entertaining joke present for my sister, a big X-Files fan. It was a disappointment. It's exactly like the classic Operation game, only the quality isn't even that good. It's much easier to get the pieces out than in Operation, so it's not challenging at all. Overall, a pretty lame present."
1,Flimsy as an alien's eyelid!,"I can't really tell you if the game is fun or not because everything was broken on it. The flimsy shell that holds the board was torn and the tweezers were broken away from their attachment. Bummer! It's a great idea though, and educational in informing people that other life forms might be in existance. I wish this game would be improved and re-issed. I'd give it a second chance!"
4,great buy,"Great game, seller shipped fast and product was just as they had stated. Game itself is built a little flimsy but if you keep it in the box it is just fine."
4,A FUN EDUCATIONAL GAME,THIS IS EDUCATIONAL AND FUN.YOU DONT HAVE TO LIKE SCIENCE FICTION TO LIKE THIS GAME.THE GAME IS SIMILAR TO THE OPOERATION GAME.YOU HAVE FUN WHILE LEARNING WHAT ORGAN IS WHICH AND WERE IT GOES IN THE BODY.
2,Not much help to application developers,"This book gets your hopes up, then fails to deliver. The concepts are not explained clearly, the technical parts don't go into enough detail, and the grammar is shaky. On the plus side, it contains a lot of pointers to additional sources of information on SNMP."
4,nice spinner,"This device works very well, enabling me to steer safely with one hand while at the same time manually shifting with the other. I only wish the grip were made of something heavier than light plastic, but they may have had their reasons for using that material. Bottom line is IT WORKS REALLY WELL!"
3,Disappointed,"We looked at a variety of glasses and compared sizes, trying to determine the capacity. We thought from the given height measurement that these glasses would hold at least two onces. They don't. They are very slim and only hold one and a half onces."
4,New Way to Look at New World,"This was a very well researched and scholarly book. (Perhaps a thesis) A bit of an effort but an interesting review of the different European powers and their takeover of the new world. I had never thought about the English love of fences, the French love of acceptance, the Spanish love of ritual and the Portugeuse love of the technology of exploration in ways that reflected how they staked out their claims. It was a new level of perspective."
5,Australian Gold,Pete Murray is the best of the best in the Australian music scene.He is a beautiful singer and an amazing song writer.This album is a stunning work of art.
1,Save your money,Worked for about 1/2 a trash can of crushing then the plastic broke. The unit is outside and the metal pins holding the plastic ram were rusting
3,"It's OK, but not great","The bin design allows the cans waiting to be crushed to bounce, flip up, and then have to be reseated to allow the cans to feed to the ram.Cans are not always crushed uniformly enough to drop through slot at the bottom of the unit."
4,can crusher,"works great for 12 oz cans. never thought about the taller cans. but that's what your foot is for. sic, sic"
4,"Great product, a bit flimsily built","I had this can crusher for 2 years during my undergraduate college years, and it did its job without worry for a long long time. Unfortunately, it's a bit flimsily crafted, as the plastic framing isn't too thick (although the crushing mechanism itself is very robust, I must note)Overall it's a great product, and I'm here to get another one. What's more, it's about $8 cheaper than when I'd bought it from The Container Store.Best can crusher for the money, in my opinion."
1,Can Ram,This product needs more development. The cans bounce around in the holder and the unit doesn't crush the cans flat enough.Don't buy one.
4,Can crusher works great!,makes the can smaller so you can fit more in the bag so you eventually save on money and twice the amount of refund you get when you recycle the cans.
3,"works, but flimsy","this product is good for crushing one can at a time (not multiples, as other reviews had stated which influenced me to buy this) #1) the basket is way too flimsy and constantly falls apart when you try to put more than one can in the basket #2) when crushing it pops the cans above and usually puts them in the wrong position, so you are better off just loading one at a time..."
2,Auto feed is a joke.,"Would not reccommend this to an enemy let alone a friend. As I said the auto feeder is a joke. Put cans in and they do not feed properly.Have to push each can in place by hand and the hopper gets in the way for that. Go down in all directions but the way they should and hang up in the hopper. Hopper is flimsey to say the least and must be screwed into the wall to give it any kind of stability. Definately expected more and got much less. Crusher works one can at a time ""without the hopper"" great. Very disappointed."
4,surprise!,"This thing works great but I was surprised to find out it is made out of some kind of plastic/composite so naturally I'm concerned to how well it will hold up. I would have thought it would have been needed to be made out of cold steel about 3/32"" thick minimum. I guess this explains the low price. If it holds up well, it will be a great deal because it works super well."
1,Northern Industrial Tools Automatic Feed Can Crusher,"I brought this item and it works. But, I had for 6 months and the level broke and the rest is history. This item is cheap and worthless. I would not advised my mother to buy it. Sorry!"
1,can crusher,This product is worthless. It is cheap plastic and could not crush itself....and when I tried to return it the company gave me such a hassle that it is simply not worth it. I will certainly never order anything from them again and I strongly urge everyone else to avoid them at all cost. I want to give this item no stars but am forced to give it a score.
2,mediocre,"I received a version of the product that looked like it was returned by another buyer. The packaging was torn, and the contents were loose inside the box. I bought it for a relative, so I don't know if it works well."
3,Can Crusher,"Item works, A little flimsy but good for the price. Cans some times jam up and do not feed but still good for the price"
5,works well,"I had to give it a little time before rating it. We've used it for about a month and it seems like it's doing fine: cans are nice and flat, there's no flimsy metal to bend like my last one. Very pleased!"
4,so far,So far so good love the basket. just crush one after another like a machine. Just skeptical on it be a type of plastic an holding up. But well see on crushed a hundred can so far.
1,Sub Quality,"After assembling this and trying to use it, I come to the conclusion it is inferior and doesn't work properly. I purchased another made out of metal and not recycled plastic.Now I am happy with the metal one."
4,Met my expectations,"It crushes cans very well and does not take much effort to crush a can. The only thing i don't like is the plastic reservoir for the excess cans. This is made with with flimsy plastic, however everything else is made of sturdy plastic and metal."
1,WORTHLESS!,"I had a steel multiple can crusher for many years that worked just great. When it finally broke I replaced it with this plastic model and found it to be a flimsy piece of junk that I would not recommend to anyone. if I put more than 2 cans in the chute the cans jammed up and I had to manually remove them and crush them one at a time. And even that was nowhere near as easy as it was with my old one. I first assumed I had not assembled it properly so I double checked the complicated assembly instructions and it seemed to be properly assembled. That was when I tossed it in the trash can, after less than a week of having it."
1,It's upside down,"Whoever designed this had to be drunk. you have to lift the handle to smash the cans. I tend to be on the weak and shakey side so this is hard for me to do. I could lift the handle to raise it to squah the next can, but on this model I can'r get enough umph to raise the handle squashing the can.Isac Newton had an apple fall on his head and discovered gravity.Mix the opposition of gravity with the upward shakey force needed to squish cans and you have a terrible product.BTW it's all plastic and pretty punnie at that."
4,Very Good Tool,"Does its job well, but is somewhat flexible.Simple enough to be used by 9 year oldchildren while having fun."
3,Looks better in picture,"Works well, but the plastic can holder is flimsy. I would have liked it a bit stronger. Hope to find other items I can use from this company."
4,Can Ram - Aluminum Can Crusher LIKES,"I found this can crusher to be very handy and durable for residence use. Meaning it is extremely good for the family that does a handful of cans at a time. I have not nor do I intend to try to crush a trash bag full at anyone time. There are few things I would like to see incorparated into it, but to small to mention in this review and would not change the main operation. RLW"
2,Good News Bad News,"The Ram function is adequate and will accommodate 16 oz cans without the hopper. The Hopper however is one of the worst cheap thin rubberized plastic pieces of China junk on the Planet period !Be prepared to have 8 small tie wraps to hold the 4 separate ""POS"" sides that are designed to snap together (did I say POS).I actually used aircraft safety wire to hold together the worlds worst design EVER concieved !Other than that, after one day of use (60+ cans) the main frame & can ram mechanism has not failed and does a good job."
4,Good replacement for previous can crusher of same design.,Good replacement for previous can crusher of same make and model. Works well for the purpose designed. Better then earlier crusher of different type.
4,Not the best.....But close to it.,"This product seemed to good to be true when it arrived through the mail because it was made out of a stronger type of plastic or something like it and i did not think it would be able to crush cans but it did! Anyways the instructions are easy to ready and mounting it to the wall was a piece of cake! The only complaint I have is that the flimsy part that holds the cans up kept calling apart, But that was easily fixed with some super glue. If you crush cans in anyway I recommend this Product to You!"
2,Not what I thought,"Putting it together was easy, but the item felt cheap. It broke after a few weeks. I am looking for one built with better materials."
1,Northern Industrial automatic feed can crusher,I dislike it. It's made of cheap plastic and it has to mounted. Maybe I should have read the disscrition more carefully. None the less I cannot send it because it's not cost efectived. Oh well you live and learn.
5,automatic can crusher,"I haven't used it myself, it was for my Mom's church, but I'm sure it will help them with their fundraising efforts."
4,Surprisingly good can crusher,"At first we were afraid that this would be a cheap product, given its price and other reviews. It is made of plastic and does seem flimsy when you first put it together. However, my husband had no problem mounting it in our basement on a cinder block wall (with our own screws). Once mounted, it works very well. The hopper holds about 10 cans. It crushes the cans with very little effort and spits them neatly into the bin underneath. As other reviewers pointed out, you do have to watch how the cans fall. But, otherwise, it has drastically reduced our can crushing time. I think it's much easier and faster than The Crusher we'd been using for years."
3,Low Quality,I receivd this product as promised and package well. I would not recommend the crusher as it is light weight and will not stand up to a great deal of use. The design is poor so far as being ridgid enough to handle crushing any cans that are not extremely thin. The lever action is not proportioned to make it easy to operate. Amazon did their part but the manufacturer needs to redesign the crusher with a higher quality of material.
3,crusher,This crusher works pretty good!I took the basket off because when it gets down to the last few cans they tend to turn around in the basket. When that happens you have to stick your hand in and turn them around.Its just as fast 1 at a time!
4,worth the cash,"a very good product, except the plastic that holds the cans in place broke so it's a little lopsided,but still works. i would buy it again"
3,Not bad for price,I don't know what it is with things you buy these days but everything is so flimsy. This can crusher is not bad but the holder is thin plastic and doesn't guide the cans very well. As far as crushing cans it does the job and is much better than lining up the cans and stomping. I would buy again but I'm convinced someone could come up with something more sturdy.
1,"great idea, bad design","Like others, the plastic handle broke quickly rendering the thing useless. Hmmm, I wonder if I can recycle it???"
1,Wish hadn't bought it,"Can ram is poorly manufactured and poorly designed. When it came there was way to much extra plastic left on, in fact it blocked one of the screw holes. The ram is poorly designed; it hits the cans at an angle and pushes the can sideways a lot of the time. I have wound up having to hold the can in place to et it to crush. The pin that holds the handle and ram to the wall part has nothing to hold it in place and worked its way out the first time I used it. The hopper is a joke. The only ""good"" thing was the cheap price. I should have paid more."
1,JUNK,"piece of crap, broke on first day of use. useless, waste of money composite should not be so week FAIL"
1,I hate it,This product is cheaply made it does not work properly and does not hold up to crushing cans for very long. I have had only a few days used it once with poor results. I plan on returning it. The seller was quick to send it but you can bet they never tryed using this useless product
3,Can Crusher,Didn't like that it was plastic but it does the job! Was iffy about it at first. Bought for my dad and he was expecting something sturdier.
5,Made In the USA thank God.....,"This can crusher is sturdy, efficient, inexpensive and most importantly MADE IN THE USA....I not only bought myself one, I bought one for my sister and her husband as well."
2,DON'T LIKE IT !,IT DOES NOT CRUSH 10 CANS AS ADVERTISED AND WAS CLUMSY TO USE. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE RESULTS I GOT.
3,Seems to work ok,"Length:: 0:50 MinsUpdate 11/12:The lower hinge broke after crushing about 500 cans. If it had been made of metal, it probably would have lasted longer.In about 15 mins (with a helper) we reduced 3 garbage bins full of alum cans into just one trash bin. Since the device is plastic, it might not last forever, but it seems work pretty well. I'd pay double for the same device made of steel. Too bad The Count from Sesame Street wasn't around for the play by play."
1,Not impressed,This crusher is a hit and miss. Seems every other can gets stuck or pops up and blocks the rest of the cans. Not worth the frustration.
5,awsome,"Had this same can crusher for at least 10 yrs. It was the best we've ever had, so I had to have the same one again."
4,dependable crusher,"a great can crusher, its been crushing at least a case of cans every day for over 6 months. not bad for plastic.its messy and has to be cleaned often. it doesn't crush the cans as small as most of the other crushers I've used.overall i am satisfied, and would recommend it."
5,super crusher,got this for a buddy of mine and crushed three rubbermaid garbage cans worth that weekend... put it through it's paces and he's been using it for 6 months now with no complaints
5,Great time Saver,"I purchased this about a week and a half ago and have so far crushed well over 1,000 cans. The product is made out of a strong plastic that thus far has held up great. I am looking forward to going through more cans and crushing my way to build some savings out of it. I would highly recommend it to anyone who has either a recycling program or even a community service cleanup project."
2,Nice while it lasted,"I had to return it because the handle simply snapped off while I was using it.. It's not like I am overly strong, it just snapped. I'm gonna try again by ordering another one from another company. The company I ordered from had no problem with returns."
1,broke the first use,"feed basket is very flimsy, broke in 3 places the first time i used it. I seriously doubt it will last if exposed to sun/outdoors. hopefully, the all metal one will be of better quality, actually, almost anything will surpass this piece of junk. DON'T WAST YOUR MONEY ON THIS THING!"
1,Cheap construction,"There's hardly anything ""automatic"" about this can crusher. It has a cheap piece of plastic that forms a feeding bin on top. However, for anything other than occasionally crushing a can or two per month, this thing just doesn't hold up. The bin isn't ""automatic"" as cans often get stuck instead of feeding the crusher. So while it seems like a good idea in a single picture viewed on a web site, in practice it doesn't really work well enough to be used regularly."
2,Cheap design & materials,"It looked like a sturdy product from the pictures, but the parts are flimsy, the design is not solid, so it falls apart thus completely useless."
5,So simple even a 3 year old can do,My kids love this and so does my husband. Because of where we mounted it we took off the basket. Not a big deal once you catch up from not crushing your cans. It's a nice strong plastic.
2,There are better ones out there,"I bought this can crusher hoping for it to last a descent amount of time. Considering how flimsy Soda cans are these days, you would think it would work great. It did for about 3 months, then the part that actually crushes the can started to bend. I can tell that in a little more time, it will probably break off. I will be looking for another can crusher."
1,Give it 0 stars if I could,This thing is worthless. The ram never resets properly for the next can. It constantly is trying to push it's way out of the can chute. After only a six pack the handle broke. I'm not even going to bother with shipping it back in. I'll keep my $5.00 and put it towards an all metal one with a guided ram.
4,"Good Price, works well.",This can crusher works well and was easy to hang on my utility room wall. I don't know how long it will last but it was cheap enough to replace if I need to. Seller was fast and product was as promised.
5,Can crusher,Easy to put together and install. I like the fact you can put 10 cans in it before you need to crush them. U can then do it with one hand. Great product.
1,Disappointed in Utah,"the description for the can crusher should mention that it only accommodates regular size cans, the 16 oz size are too long to fit in the hopper. You can get them to crush if you insert them one at a time and the hopper is empty, but it doesn't work like the picture describes."
2,Not a dream machine!,"This product is flimsier than it looks - the hopper is a floppy, unstable plastic cage that doesn't have much support. After we got the product assembled (have to use hammer to get the rod through and the hopper just sits mostly unconnected to the crusher (strange)) we mounted two at a local recycling center. Within one week one of them had a broken plastic piece chipped off. We also found that the aluminum cans HAVE TO BE ABSOLUTELY UNDENTED for this product to work. If a can is even dented slightly it will result in the cans above it to sink down and be in the way of the crushing ram. That of course results in having to manually lift the above cans and either remove the problem can or crush it with special care. Now who wants to do that when this crusher is supposed to expedite crushing?! I would recommend buying a metal can crusher and though it will only hold one can at a time, you will be less frustrated than you will be if you purchase this one. Hope that helps!"
2,Ok but not that great,"I bought this crusher to replace another one that had failed. I had hopes that this one would be more time efficent, etc. Needless to say that it did not last long. For me it did handle the full amount of cans with very minimal times of a can getting sideways and the only cans taht ever got sideways for me was if I was combining a small 6 oz can with the 12 oz cans. So I just did not combine the two sizes.Sadly being plastic it was not long before the bin assembly began to always pop out of the little slots for them. Soon it was always needing to be pushed back behind the slots and part of the basket broke apart.So for a short while it was great, but needed to be buidt wiser and stronger."
5,Excellent product,"I have had this for over a year now. It is still working great. It paid for itself in the first six months. The cans need to be placed correctly in the shoot or they don't drop down in the proper place to be crushed. If you take the time to do that, you will have no problems."
5,Great Can Crusher,"Strong, durable can crusher. Feeds easily when multiple cans are in chute. Bonus, the kids love using it!"
1,Light Duty,I used it twice in the year that I've owned it for a total of about 50 cans. The lever is weak and failed quickly. Many inexpensive items are worth their money if you only intend to use them once or twice but a can crusher you would expect a few years of constant use at a minimum. Look elsewhere.
4,Works Great,"This black phone cord looks nice, and works exactly as advertised. A good value. It has not twisted. The sound quality is good."
5,nice,Unfortunatly for me this didnt fit my phone receiver because it was slanted so we switched to our other phone and it fit great.Works well.
3,"Beware, this cord won't fit all phones","Good product, but beware that the swivel adapter won't fit all phones. If your handset has a recessed socket for the phone cord, the large round swivel adapter won't go into the socket far enough to work.Also, check the title of the product not just the photo. Both the ivory and black cords use a picture of a black one. I didn't read the title completely ""Softalk Twisstop Detangler with Coiled, 25-Foot Phone Cord, Ivory"" and accidentally ordered ivory for my black phone. Which turned out not to matter since the thing won't work on my black phone anyway."
1,Worst product I ever bought online,"This is the worst product I ever bought online. First, it was supposed to be white and it was actually a bad shade of drab yellow. I had seen the reviews about static but there seemed to be more reviews without static. But the static is so bad, you can't hear anyone on the other end most of the time. Also, the bulk of the plug part interferes with the cradle when you hang up. Since I have a wall-mounted phone, the handset keeps falling out of the cradle onto the floor. DON'T BUY THIS."
2,Didn't work with my phone!,"I have an old corded base/answering machine with satellite cordless phones, and I wanted this for the base unit. Unfortunately, I couldn't get it plugged in due to the ""geography"" of the phone - not enough space before hitting a protrusion."
1,did not fit,Did not fit my phone (GE office phone purchased 10 years ago). The connector is to short and will not fit into the receiver.
2,Adapter did not fit in my phone.,I had to take the twist top adapter off the cord as this part did not fit in my phone. Obviously I bought it for the twist top adapter.
1,Came apart.,Used this with a nortel meridian phone system. The cone shaped spinner came apart from the handset end of the cord assembly. The sound quality was good until it broke. However my reason for purchasing this was to avoid replacing phone cords that get tangled. This didn't solve the problem.
3,Softalk Tangle Free Phone Cords,"Work well as a quality phone cord, but the no tangle rotating feature did not work. They twisted just as much as the regular phone cords we have."
4,Pretty in pink... or is it?,"I'm happy with this scarf on many levels--it's warm, soft, and very pretty. However, I ordered the pink and it's significantly darker than the pink in the photo, which is a color I would've preferred. Aside from that, it's a great scarf at a great price."
4,Color is not exactly as shown,"The scarf is soft and comfortable. However, be cautious that the color is not as light as shown in the picture. I ordered camel but it arrived much darker than the picture. So I have to give it to my mom because the it is not what I expected. She likes it though, after all, it worths the price."
2,not good,"I ordered 2, and just returned both of them. The pink is much darker than the picture, and the ivory looks cheap."
2,"Accomplishes what it should, I guess.","The tailgate cap comes in a fabulous triangular box which in all honesty was about the most impressive thing about the whole package. Pulling the cap out of the box you'll notice there's all of 6, 1/4 x 6 in. strands of 3M tape to keep it on your truck. Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! Way to break out the big guns there winners. It serves its purpose, which is to cover the tailgate, but its made out of 1/8 in. plastic that feels like as soon as it drops below 10 degrees there's going to be some serious popping and cracking action. I'm a little disappointed that this was 30 dollars and I paid for it. Go with a different company or at least a different type. This is worth about 5 dollars in plastic bottle returns."
1,False advertising,"The product I received says on it ""Henna for your hair"" and NOT, as the image displayed on the product page says, ""al Arousa"". I was looking specifically for a body art quality henna and on the Amazon product page it describes the Henna has being perfect for body art. So why does the package I was sent say it's for the hair? Disappointed, especially since the shipping cost was such a rip off."
1,Not good,"The siphon didn't work, and I am discourged by the company. In the packaging was a can not return policy. I am out $75 for something that doesn't work. I am not happy with amazon sub contracting to companies who won't stand behind their products. Back to Macys I go..."
3,which is more wasteful?,using a metal co2 cartridge per quart... or a plastic bottle that uses a big tank? i suppose the transport cost associated with the seltzer you buy in a store tips the scale... but i wish we could reuse the 8gram co2 cartidges for the soda siphon (a la that other home carbonating system ...)
4,Win-win! Covenient and environmentally friendly!,"Overall, I highly recommend this product.Pros:It's really nice not having to go out to the store to buy bottles of seltzer water anymoreChargers are cheap - buy bulk and you can get them for 40 cents each or lessNo added salt like the store containersReally nice to add to juice, less sugar and you can stop drinking soda easilyCons:The design of the top piece is ok, but you have to be careful. When you twist the nozzle on and off, make sure you twist using the spout instead of the dispensing button, or the button will probably break.I wish the bottle were easier to fill, the hole on the top could be a bit larger. Not a deal breaker though."
4,Very good soda siphon,"Soda siphon appears to work as advertised. One 8g cartridge makes one quart of soda. If I use cold water, and give it a few minutes to give the CO2 time to mix properly, the resulting soda is good, with plenty of fizz.All in all, I would give the product 5 stars except for two small issues:1) When filling the container, there is no way to know when it is getting full (except for waiting for it to run over). It's not a problem if you fill it over the sink, but I fill mine with filtered, cold water from my fridge.2) The small 8g containers are the only option for charging the unit. They are not horribly expensive if purchased in bulk (lots of 100), but this product seems a perfect candidate for a small regulator/adapter which would allow you to charge from a single larger tank.Still, as I stated above, my siphon works well. I would certainly recommend it based on my experience."
3,"Good for price, but...","This is a high quality soda siphon. I got it first to get rid of all the soda water that I buy everytime I go to the grocery store. So far, the taste is better than regular store-bought soda. The cap must be screwed on VERY TIGHTLY when inserting the CO2 cartridge. It cannot be loose like the other jars you are used to. And to cap it on very tightly takes quite a bit of force, which sometimes I forget and the siphon starts leaking water from the cap. The ISI CO2 cartridges are quite expensive too, but I bought other 3rd party cartridges work as well, flawlessly.So far, I am satisfied with this siphon, which I got as a gift. Whether I would buy the same one myself... Hmmm... I don't know..."
1,"Own Two, Both Leak","I am a total soda water freak. Perrier, Pelegrino, even Canada Dry. Being able to save money, bottles and the planet sounds like a great option. Not with this device, though. The seal, between the top and the bottle lasts about one month before the leaking starts. The harder you screw down to the top to prevent the leaks, the sooner it wears out altogether. The result: You have a fridge full of water as the contents slowly dribble out through the top. Now it doesn't even get that far; the fizz escapes right away. Bought a second one, as I thought it might be a defect. Nope. So I now own a third soda siphon, a Liss 1-liter. It's much better. No leaks. Go for that one."
2,iSi 2248 Soda Siphon,"This Soda Siphon does work but the water is not very bubbly. The commercially bottled seltzers are a lot bubblier and cheaper. Be sure to investigate where to purchase the CO2 cartridges before you buy this because I found that I can't buy cartridges locally. It is fun to use, but definitely not worth the money."
5,super soda,"I've been wanting one of these for years and finally found them at a reasonable price, I enjoy the carbonated water so much that I ended up buying three bottles."
4,Works well if done right,"I bought this item on line and it arrived 3 weeks ago. LOVE it. The secret to making it work is to use COLD water-I keep a bottle in the frig just to refill the seltzer bottle. Then, after the full bottle is charged with the cartridge, shake the whole unit 20 - 30 times. This disperse the bubbles. Great seltzer and I am really happy about NOT producing more waste in terms of plastic or cans and using secondary fossil fuels to have those cans/bottles delivered to the store and the picked up for recyclable waste removal and then recycling by trucks using fossil fuels. My only complaint is that the iSi cartridges are expensive as much as $1 each cartridge to $0.66 in bulk (a case of 360) - I have ordered some less expensive brands online and will see how they work out."
2,"Beautiful, But That's It.","TheiSi Soda Siphon is beautiful, but it doesn't work very well. The carbonation is extremely light. I would definitely recommend a different product."
5,Fuctional and easy to use.,"I bought this item over a year ago, and I use it almost everyday to make sugar free sodas. It has never failed, and is quite easy to use. I am planning on buying another one soon, just so that I can have a different color!"
2,Soda Siphon falls short,"I purchased this item in the hope of having an abundance of seltzer, whenever I wish to drink some. Unfortunately, when I add the carbon dioxide to my cold water, some of the gas is released through the shut-off valve. In other word I am unable to put enough carbon dioxide into my water to make it fizz sufficiently. I have tried to use only 2/3d of a quart of water, and still some gas escapes. So I conclude that the pressure-containing mechanism of this bottle is insufficient. I cannot recommend it to anyone."
3,OK when it isn't leaking,"We drink a lot of seltzer. So much that we began to be concerned about the effects on the environment. So, we thought we would try making our own. Overall it's pretty easy to use. The seltzer is not quite as fizzy as store-bought, but it's pretty good. The two things that bother us are that we feel like we're making it all the time (several times a day) and the fact that it tends to drip a bit. We're sticking with it for now, though."
5,ISI Soda Siphon,The soda siphon was much nicer than I had anticipated. I am very pleased with this purchase.
1,junk. iSi needs to recall this product.design flaws.,"Same as all the other reviews. Works for two weeks, then all the gas comes out if the nozzle and does not go into the water. Avoid this product. My first one was missing a part. iSi soda siphons are defective and the product needs recalling in my experience and that of many others on this list....When it works it's fine, but it doesn't ."
2,Disappointing,"Resulting carbonated water is weak, with ""fat"" bubbles that go flat quickly. Think before you buy: 1 brass cartridge per charge--is this really any more environmental than buying plastic bottled water? (I might just switch to uncarbonated.) Disappointing."
5,Super seltzer and a great diet aid,"Works perfectly - great for drinks, spritzers, and spraying friends or obnoxious guests. As a diet aid, I spritz fruit juice with half seltzer - it tastes brighter, fresher, and has half the calories.As others note, the Soda Siphon works best when:> the water is pre-chilled> after charging, shake well and refrigerate for an hour> Shake between spritzesTo always be ready, I keep a Nalgene (bpa-free) bottle or two of chilled water in the fridge - that way I can refill the Soda Siphon as soon as it's used up.Also, the MrFizz Seltzer Chargers work perfectly ... and are under 40 cents each when bought in quantity.One warning: the first time you get ready to charge the Siphon, do it in the sink. If the top is not tightly - very tightly - closed the Siphon becomes a Vesuvius that can't be turned off.A great bottle at a super price."
5,excellent product,I bought this for my son after he coveted the one I had. He just loves it and his family has enjoyed making all kinds of fun drinks.
3,You must order CO2 cartridges separately,This does not come with a cartridge...be sure to order some when you order this. I have not had the opportunity to use this since I have to wait for my cartridges to arrive.
2,The third and all are fails,"As my title says, all failed very soon after purchase. Leaks. Little backup. No excuse for a product like this to fail within a few months. None.Maybe an American product will fill the void."
3,Only lasted 7 months!!!,When I first received and started using this ISI soda siphon I immediately loved it and started to use it a lot! Unfortunately after only 7 months of use the top valve mechanism failed and I can no longer charge water without it jetting out of the small charge nozzle or out of the front as if I were squeezing the lever (and I am not). I'm not sure what happened to cause this however I am sure that something of this price and supposed quality level should have more than a measly 7 months life span. Now I am in the market for another device. Perhaps others who have purchased this will have better luck than I did however buyer beware.Other thoughts: The carbonated water this siphon produces is not as fizzy as I would have liked. It makes very finely carbonated water with small champagne-like bubbles not anything like commercial soda where you see larger bubbles of gas.
3,"Unit works nice, after we got some cartridges which they forgot to include...","Nothing is more frustrating than receiving an item without all of the parts. We got this with no CO2 cartridge and there is literally no way to communicate to Amazon about it. Also, we went to the company's web store online to try to get them to send us the missing cartridge and they told us they were not afiliated with the manufacturer, can you believe that? It was not worth the hassle and expense to send the unit back for 1 missing cartridge. Nice.With that being said we finally received some CO2 cartridges and the unit works great. We were paying about 87 cents per 16 ounce bottle in the store, now we are paying about 35 cents when buying the CO2 cartridges in bulk.So if you are lucky enough to get a unit with a cartridge, you will probably like it. But don't count on any customer service."
2,Perrier price for so so water,"I have little use for kitchen gadgets that you have to read the manual every time you use it. Shake 5 times, make sure you screw it on straight, don't forget both tubes, only fill to the line, now go find the black cartridge holder, screw it in, bang!!!!, what the hell happened, oh crap I forgot the little tube thing, dang now the gasket is screwed up. I suppose it is nice if you are going to entertain and you want to impress but again, you'll need to spend a good 15 minutes trying to figure the damn thing out and if you don't use cold water, you'll get bad water out. Why not buy perrier or pellegrino? After you calculate the cost with the very expensive CO2 charges, it's much cheaper to buy the good stuff."
3,isi soda siphon review,"I have been using iSi soda siphon for about 2-3 months right now. Overall I am happy with theway it works. Although, when I followed the instruction the siphon content was coming outof every pore of it. I then realized if I don't fill it the way the instruction mentioned,but rather leave some space then the siphon worked pretty good. One drawback is thatthe soda water has a taste to it!!! It gets the plastic flavor of the straw it uses. Evenif I transfer it to another bottle right after making it, it still has a light taste to it.Another draw back which I think is inherent to all siphons is that, it does not maintain thebubble for more than 3-7 days. The ones you buy at stores like Safeway keep for 2weeks.Finally it is not as cheap as I thought. The cartridges come to about $1.14 which is same priceas Safeway bottles. I was hoping to make my own for lot less, say 50-80 cents a bottle.Still, you get to make your own flavored drinks.--Steve"
4,I Love This Gadget,"This little item makes the best soda water and without all the sodium in the store-bought soda.It's easy to use and has performed flawlessly. My only complaint is that to snug down the top, prior to charging, one has to use the spout as a grip. I wonder if this will shorten its life?"
2,Disappointing,"I bought the isi siphon last summer, trying to avoid buying so many plastic bottle club sodas from the grocery store. I loved the product when I first got it. I used it almost everyday, and was very happy with being able to make my own soda water at home whenever I felt like it.But by the end of the summer, the siphon started to fail. Whenever I screw a CO2 cartridge in, all the gas comes out of the nozzle with a big hiss and none of the gas goes into the bottle. So I tried loosening up the cap a bit, pour out a bit of the water, tighten the cap more, top up the water, but nothing worked. Every time I screw on a cartridge, all the gas escapes out of the nozzle. Other reviewers have mentioned the same experience as well. There is no obvious leak or defect, and there is no work-around. The siphon is now just a shiny black expensive water bottle."
3,Not without some drawbacks,"I had the Soda Siphon (the black one) for about three years. On balance, I would say it worked well to produce fizzy water for most of that time. I found that (as other reviewers have stated) I do have to chill the water beforehand, and I do have to shake it well once it's charged. That's not so bad. I found that it is prone to leaking water out of the nozzle once it's been charged, which is a minor annoyance, but I just got in the habit of putting a dish towel under it. Also, I never found a satisfactory way to clean it really well, but that wasn't a huge problem in practice as I only ever put plain distilled water and nothing else in it.But recently it has stopped charging at all -- most of the gas just goes straight out the nozzle in a big angry jet when I try to charge it. I assume it's developed a leak of some sort, but I can't find it. This isn't something that I can work around. So, I'm looking for a new soda bottle now and will be considering other options."
2,Doesn't work that well,"This product doesn't seem to carbonate to the level of regular soda water from the store. I drink carbonated water all the time and what comes out of this tastes a little flat.The product also seems cheaply made. The first time I tried it, all the CO2 blew out the spout because the handle sits at a point where the valve is slightly open. I have to pull up on the handle when I insert the charger to get it to work."
2,Fill amount uncertain; leaks half the time,"Since I cannot tell exactly how much water to put in here, I've taken to measuring out the water in a liter container, pouring that in, hand-tightening the unit, then pressurizing with a CO2 cartridge.At least half the time a bunch of water leaks out and I have to release water manually until the leakage stops.I use the same amount every time, tighten it securely, etc. so I'm not sure what's going on. But ultimately I don't care - the lack of a visual method for checking the fill-amount renders this device impractical. I could use less water...which means I'll be underfilling, using more CO2, and having to refill more frequently.The glass bottles are more expensive but ultimately the way to go. Save your money and skip this one."
4,"Works great, but you MUST read the other reviews for advice.","I'll join the consensus: the siphon works great IF you follow the advice in the other reviews, starting with A. Abdine's. My only addition is that it's OK (actually imperative) to screw the spigot assembly tightly down on the canister. I have an innate fear of over-tightening, so on my first try, I didn't tighten that assembly adequately. Water spewed out when I charged the canister. The next time, I made sure to tighten down firmly, and all was well. I'm sure you could still over-tighten, so don't go nuts. But you do want to make sure there's a nice tight seal between the canister and the spigot. Otherwise, just follow the other reviewers' excellent advice about using cold water, a cold canister, swiftly twisting in the CO2 cartridge, etc.P.S. - Cook up a nice fresh ginger simple syrup, and add this great fizzy water, and you'll have the BEST ginger ale."
4,Remember to buy the cartridges!,"I was excited to order and get the iSi Soda Siphon. I probably did not read the instructions clearly enough so I didn't realize two things: 1) they don't give you any ""starter"" cartridges with the product; and 2) it takes one cartridge per siphon (silly me - I figured you would get several uses from each cartridge!) At nearly $1 a cartridge, that can get expensive. I am going to try to order them in bulk online and save. However, unless you drink TONS of carbonated drinks, it may take years to realize any savings over buying club soda for $.99 per two-liter bottle.However, the ""cool factor"" of the siphon might be worth it the cost! My kids are loving adding the water to their juice and I have to admit it's a fun toy. I just purchased some of the soda stream flavors today and we are going to try to make some root beer tonight. It should be fun!"
1,soda siphon,"Unfortunately the device does not work very well at all. The CO2 cartridge fires into the bottle, but the soda water that comes out has almost no carbonation at all. Very disappointing."
5,Fantastic Fizz!,"Purchased a gorgeous Red version of this siphon & use it regularly three years later. It's easy to use & I love that it keeps the water carbonated for a long while in the refridgerator. For best results, use cold water & rotate the siphon end over end after dispensing the CO2 cartridge. So much fun. Order chargers in quantity if you like sparkling water. I only wish it held more water in the siphon! It's fabu and fun!"
4,Works well,"I've waited almost a year to review this, to be sure I tested the unit thoroughly.Although it has sometimes leaked out when the CO2 cartridge is added, that's happened infrequently enough that I'm not deducting stars for that - I think it's been my error, either from overfilling the bottle or not screwing the top on correctly.It seems fussy to use at first, but once you've done it a few times, it's a no-brainer.For best results, I keep the Soda Siphon in the fridge (even when empty), and also keep a quart-size mason jar of water in the fridge. This way, I always have a cold quart of water ready, with a cold Soda Siphon too. This seems to be the best combination for achieving a fizzy bottle of seltzer. My Soda Siphon is still going strong, one year later."
4,Very handy,"Works as advertised. A less slippery surface would be nice as it slid out of my hand for the ""shake 5 times"" and broke a dish in the sink. Hold on tight!"
1,incomplete,"iSi Siphon arrived in good shape but without a charger. The Product Description includes this statement, ""It comes with a CO2 soda charger "". So, until I now buy a charger, I can't even try it out! How can I rate it?"
2,Unusable soda siphon,"Product arrived just before business trip. I just opened last night (3/18) and was not pleased to discover that one part (the measuring tube, #2403001) was NOT in the package. Also, there was no interior protective wrapping, which indicates to me I was sent a product returned by someone else as defective. As there was no measuring tube I was unable to use the product."
1,"Definitely Not ""the best of Barbie""","While this book has some interesting photos from this one collection, it has photographs of anything but the ""best"" examples of the various Barbies--especially the vintage dolls--some of them are down-right scarey looking with running, gouged face paint, chopped off hair, examples of ponytail dolls without ponytails, mis-identified dolls and a hodge-podge of information and misinformation. If I were a new collector, this book would be of little help in learning what a particular doll should look like--it's easy to find played-with dolls that are all mussed up--the hard part for a new collector is knowing what the doll should look like when learning to gauge authenticity and condition--this book seems like someone was assigned to write a Barbie book and they did it--but that someone was not a collector or authority."
5,What can I say?,"It's a boot tray. It shipped intact. No holes, and not broken so there's 4 stars right there. It holds 2 pairs of size 14 shoes/boots and keeps my floor from being an absolute mess. It is pretty stiff, which I know was a complaint from some others about it but my thinking is that if you need to carry it outside to rinse it off or whatever, you don't want a flimsy one possibly folding over and spilling on the floor. It doesn't feel like I could throw baseballs at it but when it's on the floor it should be fine.It's a boot tray...just buy it if you're looking."
4,Perfect for shoes,"No complaints about this mat, it is what it is, works great for dirty or wet shoes by the door."
5,great product,"great product shipped fast. mats work great for shoes and under the dogs water dish. packaging was okay, box was mangled a little"
5,Boot tray - Multy Industries Standard Boot Tray,This boot tray is somewhat thin and flimsy - but serves its purpose well. Economical andperfect for an apartment
2,not good for pet water bowls,"I got this to protect the floor from my pet water bowls, but the back and top sides are slick and slippery, moving easily on the carpet and wood floor. So the water bowls easily can be spilled by a rambunctious cat or dog. So it may be great for boots, but not so much for pet water bowls."
3,Tray works but ridges should be taller,"The tray does retain melted snow and prevent puddles on the floor (how could it not?) but the ridges for the boots to rest on are minimalist and do not allow enough air to circulate and dry the boot soles. Consequently, even after a couple of days, when I removed the boots to wear them the soles were still wet, which present the challenge of donning them without creating watermarks on the floor."
3,Boot tray review,item was good buy for the money. would have liked better if the product was thicker.
3,boot tray - OK for the price,"I wasnt expecting much out of a shoe tray that only costs a few bucks. The cost of shipping almost negates the good value. The material is thin and pretty brittle. I ordered two and one was broken by the time I recieved it. I do want to give credit to the vendor who agreed to send me a replacement tray at no additional cost to myself. Ultimatly, I pretty much got what I paid for."
4,Very Informative,I found this book very useful when selecting trees for landscaping. The sketches were useful in identification.
3,Very convenent,"However I just did not enjoy the size of this behind the ear unit, found it to be too big. It is a little difficult at first learning how to slip this around your ear but after awhile it works out ok. Please note that you do not get to use your selected ring tone, it automaticly (Motorola hand set) defaults to its standard ring while the blue tooth is actively connected. You can turn the ear piece off then power on to answer in order to keep your fav ring tone. All in all it works very well, sound and loundness were very good. However, I just did not like the size of this unit. It is quite bulky.EDITJust picked up a HS850, now that is more to my liking, however I hope there will be no issues of a broken wire in the flip boom as the reviewer above mentioned."
1,Not very happy,"I was not pleased at all with this product. My ""cheap"" bluetooth headset that came with the phone was much better. I am pleased, however, with how easy it was to return to Amazon and receive credit."
1,EXTREMELY dissatisfied,"I am on my 2nd one within as many weeks. Though the piece is comfortable (a bit cumbersome to put on) the biggest problem that I am having is that it turns itself off after 10 minutes on stand-by. This happens all the time; fully charged, half charged, after a reset.. any time that it's on stand-by. Calling Motorola (as instructed in the packaging) doesn't help. They just tell you it's defective and to return it to the retailer. I will say that Amazon was great with the exchange and timeliness of shipping my replacement."
3,Nice design - needs noise reduction,"This was also my first BT headset. As many people have stated, the design is really nice. It fit my ears really good and was very comfortable to wear. The incoming sound quality is very good, but the mic is too sensitive and picks up too much background noise. It worked really good if I was in a quiet room, but was pretty unusable when in my car."
2,Nice design that fits great -- too bad it's already broken,"I bought this headset after looking at many different styles and finding this one fit the best. I have small ears, and most of the other designs I tried on fell right off, or felt like they were about to fall off. This one fits nice and snug. The voice quality was OK; not great, but no worse than my Razr, which sounds pretty crummy to begin with.Unfortunately, I made the mistake of dropping it. It fell just a few feet from where I was sitting to a carpeted floor, yet it hasn't worked right since. I don't think anything meant to be carried around should be quite this delicate...."
2,"""Are you on a mini-bike?""","Not one. Not two. Three people asked me this question. No, I was not on a mini-bike, I was using my new headset, the H605. I was also asked ""Are you talking through a tube?"". None of these were the effect that I am looking for. Not only that, I guess my ears are too big for this too, as it is pretty painful to wear over time. Finally, I thought it looked pretty silly- which was the clincher. I had the H500 before this and unfortunately lost it. I guess I will be re-purchasing it as it was far beyond this one for sound quality and comfort on my XL ears."
2,Too big for ear!,Hurts the ear after wearing for an hour or more. Picks up background noise. Has a fair battery life. Must be a better blue tooth headset somewhere?
2,H605 Headset,"The headset has good sound in the earpicece, but people with whom I am talking complain about scratchy sound. In addition, it has a very limited range on my Treo 650, maybe 3 feet. I love the design, but wish that it worked better."
2,Cool looking but don't buy!,"I just bought this headset and am already regretting it. It looks like the coolest bluetooth headset on the market, but it's bigger than you expect. If fits well if you have big ears, but mine are small and it hangs down and looks like an earing. Other people have complained about the reciever not being able to hear the one with this headset on, but I have had the opposite problem. People can hear me fine, but on my end, I hear lots of static and find it difficult to hear the person I am talking to, and my phone is just right in my pocket. I don't know if that's just because of my specific phone model that it does this or because it just doesn't work right. I don't recommend this headset, it's better to find one that works well than to get one because it looks cooler when you wear it."
3,value for money!,"i wasn't sure of what i was buying when i placed the order! But when i got the package ( the delivery was quite fast ), and started using the H605 Bluetooth - i was rather impressed with the style and quality. And for the money i paid - i actually bought 2 of them! For someone who does not wants to spend a lot of money but still want a good stylish bluetooth -the H605 is not bad at all! It sure has its limitations - but then thats fine!"
1,Don't buy this for the Iphone,It got a lot of static noise. The connection was not good either. You have to put your phone within 6 inches away from the ear piece to get better reception. Regret for buying it. One useless item and money go down the drain.
3,"Not bad, just so so","It is convenient, easy to wear. However, the voice is not very clear, especially when you use it in street."
4,Motorola H605 Bluetooth Headset,This unit has great battery life. The in-ear comfort is a bit less than the Plantronics I replaced. Sound quality of what you hear is good but I've had comments that my voice sounds muffled and scratchy to my listeners. For the price this is a good unit.
2,Bluetooth Blues,This ear piece did not work well with my Treo 650 and I returned it. The experience turned me off to any bluetooth ear piece.
3,Acceptable Sound Quality.,I purchased this to use with my Razr V3. Initial setup was easy. Headset fits comfortably even after couple of hours. Easy to fit on my ear(s). Good that I can use on both left & right side. Good battery life. Buttons are easy to operate. These are all the goods.I only give it 3 stars because of the sound quality. I can hear the incoming calls very clearly. But the other end they cannot hear the outgoing voice clearly; only acceptable when I'm in a quiet environment & poorly when I'm in a noisy environment. I guess it has to do with the microphone being so far from the mouth. To compensate the microphone is actually very sensitive but it also picks up a lot of surrounding noise.I use this mainly for driving. On highways with stereo off & windshields up the other person can barely make out what I said; only acceptable when the car is slow or stopped. My previous Sony Ericsson HBH-35 had much clearer outgoing sound quality.
2,back to the drawing board,"The HS850 has a near perfect design. The big problem is the volume is SO LOW it makes it quite useless. I alwasy had to use my hand to press it against my ear to hear better.I switched to the Motorola H605. A little easier on the ear. It never felt like it was going to fall off. The problem was with the microphone and buttons. The mic is rests at the base of your ear. I had several complaints form callers that they could not hear me. The buttons are in an akward place and hard ro know which button was which becasue of close placement to each other.I switched agian to the H700 and love it. Loud volume, weighs practically nothing, smaller than the HS850 and the mic/on/off switch is the best on the market!"
1,Big Mistake,"Pre-ordered this product and got one before many people had reviewed it. What a mistake. Elegant design, easy to operate, paired easily with my phone. Except, it was virtually useless. Whether in a quiet environment or in my car, everyone on the other end complained about the quality. While I heard them fine, they complained that my voice cut-out, sounded like it was in a tunnel or was unintelligible. If it wasn't FULLY charged, the range dropped dramatically and the already poor sound quality deteriorated. After a month of complaints, I shelved it and bought a Plantronics 510 for half the price. It is everything that I thought the H605 was supposed to be. I can use the 510 doing 70 on the freeway and even with the roadnoise, everyone tells me the sound quality is just fine. I'm affraid Motorola seems to have put more into the physical design and not enough into testing before release. Maybe Motorola will come out with a H605a that fixes these problems; until then, avoid this one."
3,Amazon Policy?,"I bought a ""NEW"" H605 Bluetooth through Amazon and was sent a badly used one. What happened to integrity?"
3,Very big one,Its not really looking like as is in photoAnd very hard to use it because of size factorbetter to mention more deals to customers to get exact idea before they buying.
2,Bad One,"Typically, the Motorola H605 is a great bluetooth. I've owned 2 prior to this one and they were great! The volume was spectacular! When on a call, I would normally have to turn the volume down on previous ones. But, this one must be from a bad batch. Even on the loudest setting, the volume is barely audible. I've resorted to just activating my handheld and holding it up to my ear."
3,Bluetooth headset,"Gets good signal, and sound, but other person have a hard time hearing me. Always having to readjust the headset - this irritates me a lot. Will not recommend to anybody."
3,good deal,"great for the price, an little difficult for others to hear you sometimes but thats expected with the design."
3,Motorola H605 Bluetooth Headset,"When I got it I was a little scared. It was my 1st bluetooth and it looked like something straight out of Star Trek. You have to be a little careful with the twisting earpiece since it's in a sliding ball inside and can slip out of the groove very easily if you change ears too much(which mine did on day three). The range is not as far as you would like it to be, but boy can it hold a charge. It'll outlast your cellphone battery everytime! And, the fit was pretty comfy behind the ear. The buttons are also very easy to use. Remember to speak up though...people tend to have a problem hearing you as well as you will be hearing them."
1,Hard to hear Headset,"This headset is extremely hard to hear, it maintains a poor connection to my phone unlike the other headsets I have had in the past. It also does not fit well."
2,I wish it was worth keeping...,"I bought this unit because of the classy form factor. A behind-the-ear unit is much better (in my opinion) looking than the floppy, obnoxious over-the-ear units.I used to have the Moto HS810 and lost it somewhere. It was a great headset, everyone could hear me, and it had great battery life... but it was an ugly little bugger.This H605 is gorgeous and I can hear everyone who calls with extreme clarity. Unfortunately, no one can hear me (that seems to be the overriding theme in these reviews). I tried and tried to make this work, but everyone I talk to complains that I am impossible to hear. There is either too much background noise or my voice sounds too distorted to understand. My wife refuses to talk to me when I call her using this headset.So, with much sadness, I am sending it back. Looks like I'll be back to the ugly HS810 or HS850 until someone can invent a decent behind-the-ear headset."
2,another disappointment,"Got this to try along side a mot H700 (another disappointment). The comfort level is VERY good on this unit. VERY easy to pair and operate and very good incoming sound. Ougoing is another matter. What good is it for you to hear and others to not hear you? This seems to be the way Motorola works.I called Motorola tech support and was told ""I don't have that unit as they don't make a 605"". When I read the pkg. the ""tech?"" told me well just return it. We don't make these units to work with CDMA (read I have a Motoroal E815 on Verizon) but for GSM.So I don't know what I will do at this point. BTW the outgoing voice on this is so bad that in even a VERY quiet car with no windows open and no radio on you are rendered unintelligible. I only gave it 2 stars because of incoming quality and comfort. Otherwise for performance and support I'd have to say -2"
3,Just ok,I used it for about 7 months. It was just acceptable but the worst is the sound quality. Not good at all in noisy or windy environments. It is comfortable and very easy to use. Very good distance range from my cell. I am changing it due to complaints from people who could not hear or understand me while using it.
2,Motorola H605 not as expected,"This bluetooth headset is comfortable and easy to use. It connected without any issue to my Motorola RAZR V3m and did not drop any calls. The earpiece provides good sound quality and I had no trouble hearing. HOWEVER -- during every call that I made or received, the person on the other end said I sounded like I was talking through a ""tin can tunnel"". I was also constantly plagued by static ... no matter how close I was to my phone ... even on my desk, right in front of me, with only 18"" between phone and headset. I returned it to Amazon and have ordered the Jabra BT250, since it was rated highly rated by Consumer Reports -- not to mention that the overall rating on Amazon is 4.5 stars (the Motorola H605 is only rated as 2.5 stars). I'll be paying much closer attention to the ""star ratings"" in the future."
2,Can you hear me now? Nope.,"If anybody could hear me with it - I would love it. Unfortunately, they can't. I have tried this with my Verizon CDMA Razr and Cingular Blackberry 7290 - the Razr provides slightly better performance, but still not usable.The headset wears great, pairs nicely with the devices and I can hear fine. But the people I have called can not hear me at all in my car and barely hear me when I call from a quiet room. It is going straight back."
2,Dissappointed,This is my first bluetooth headset.... If you wear glasses it really sucks. In the wind you might as well not use it. I called my own voicemail to leave my self a message and the sound quality was horrible!!!
3,Fair playing of some beautiful South American music,"Luckily, I am familiar with Carlevaros Preludios Americanos dedicated to Segovia in 1968-69. The Real Audio selection of the 3rd prelude, Campo, is unfortunately incorrect. It probably is another prelude from the suite or simply another piece. I would suggest you correct this problem as this seems to be your only Carlevaro CD."
5,A must have for any Jellyfish fan,"Finally a greatest hits package from one of the more deserving bands of our time. The hits are enough but to hear a cover of Badfinger's ""No Matter What"" makes this another masterpiece"
5,An awesome compilation from one of the greatest bands!,"Jellyfish ""The Greatest"" captures Jellyfish at their very best. From tracks like ""New mistake"" and ""Baby's coming back"" to the Live versions of ""Jet"" and ""The King is half Undressed"" is just the beggining of this excellent compilation. If your a Jellyfish fan, you'll want this CD in your collection."
3,Nice photo's but not so very helpful.,"The book is a visual feast, filled with some delightfully photographed rooms and will certainly give you some design inspiration.What it will not do is give you an easy to follow abc to designing Harmonious Interiors.Each chapter contains only one page of information for 15-30 pages of photo's.Each photo has a caption telling us why that room has an appeal and you get an assortment of suggestions.There are plenty of conflicting tips to muddle over if you must, but the best thing to do is treat this book like a magazine - lust and sigh, but don't expect any practical information.A good coffee table addition but don't expect too much."
3,"OK, but forgettable","I have all but one or two of Uriah Heep's albums, and have to say this one (and Different World) are two of the most forgettable ones they did. Not bad, just generic late 80's rock. Their later albums improved, though!"
3,Slightly Disappointed,"Though I am a lover of Voltaire, I am slightly disappointed in the book. After paying what I did for this book, I expected it to be thicker and filled with crafts and such. In reality, the book is small, barely an inch thick. Though the crafts are handy and give great ideas, I just expected more. If you are an extreme lover of Voltaire, by all means go for it and purchase this book, but if not, then it simply isn't worth the $$$."
3,"Black, with Skullz.","While I enjoy Voltaire on general principles, and try to support all his efforts in whatever media, I was hoping for something a little more...dense. Thicker, more full of information. Not really why I bought the book of course, but still. Anyway, some fun is still to be had, and once I get over the headache from reading white print on black pages (of course!), I will be glad it is now part of my growing Goth Home Decorating Library."
2,"It's okay.. Not very original & sort-of ""Holly Hobby""","This book really wasn't very inspirational to me. The neatest thing in it was probably the cake. I sold my copy on Amazon. I mean it was okay, but it's just got stuff in it like covering your couch in a black throw to make it ""goth""... And making your own goth-y wine bottle labels and putting them over old bottles, then melting candles down so it looks ""old""... Wow. Not original... Not even classy. It's like dumpster diving for 13 year olds.It's got a section on how to paint baby dolls to look like zombies---- What age group is this book for? 14 year olds? Definitely Wasn't my style. There is a HUGE lack of sophistication. If you are dreaming of some old-world French inspired designs or something elegant or remotely classy whatsoever, you won't find it in this book. It's all holly hobby, dumpster diving, second hand mish mash & isn't worth your money.I gave it 2 stars, because the cake would be good to make for a 5 year old's Halloween party."
2,Gothic homemaking....for poseurs,"Ouuu...*hiss*... I said the P word... yup. This book is good if you want to pretend you are one of the children of the night. If you have your own home and you don't wanna buy your home decor from Walmart then yes get a few idea's here and there but if you dec up your home like this and light a few black candles this doesn't make you a true Goth. If you want to do it right, do your own research on what Goth means to you (and you alone)and start decorating from there. What you will end up with is a wonderfully homey feel to the person you truly are (a goth and not a Martha Stewart wanna-be) and you will love living in your home way more than these cheesy haunted house decor ideas. (PS putting up a bunch of 'the Cure' posters doesn't make you a Goth either). Trust me, I am a Goth, and I live the lifestyle more real than some poseurs I see everyday."
5,For decorators of all levels.,"This book is a great read and is a good launch pad for decorating darkly. The great thing about the projects in this book is that they are easy and versatile. The materials are not difficult or costly to obtain, the instructions are easy to follow, and there is a lot of room for personalization. I especially liked the section on goth weddings. I refer back to this book a lot, and hopefully the 66 missing pages will pop up somewhere!"
2,Disappointing,"I read the good reviews for this toy and decided to buy it. Unfortunately the experience wasn't a good one for me. The toy is heavy so is hard to handle for little kids with small hands and the sound I got was very ""airy"" (no matter the tune), like if the whistle had a air leak somewhere. The only good thing I can say about it is that, while mine didn't work, you can tell the whistle is very durable, made to last for years."
2,Probably needs tweaking,"The mouthpiece was imprecisely stamped and bent, and the blade - the part that splits the air stream - had a rough edge, making it difficult to play and impossible at the low end. Grinding it smooth made it playable, but it remained difficult to control. The wind way was uneven as well, but much more difficult to modify. I purchased two, and one would hardly play at all. If you get one, be prepared to grind/file and perhaps hammer - as the whistle makers say, ""tweak"" - and don't expect much from it save stereotypical, uneven, imprecise glissandos. As an amateur musician and maker of penny-whistles, I find this item more suitable as a defensive weapon than a precision musical instrument, or, perhaps, I simply don't understand slide whistles."
2,Not happy with the range,I am disappointed and wishing I heeded the cautionary reviews. This whistle doesn't have a full range and the notes that do work are too breathy. I am considering returning it but haven't decided because it was a gift and the person I gave it to is polite to not complain too much--although he mentioned the notes are not playing.
1,This one is good.,This is the one to buy. Don't tell your kid and just address it to them. Priceless when they get the mail. Spongebob fans unite! Worth every penny.
5,Starvengers gives birth to the genre.,"Truly amazing movie for @1980. Hard core anime fans will understand the magnintude of the movie and how it has served as a paragon for past, present, and future anime."
4,"Detailed, authoritative, interesting","I am doing research for a book on the influence of sailing on life today, and this book has been invaluable. It has much more detail and covers a broader range of subjects than any other book I've been able to find. Thank you to the authors for pulling together so much interesting research into one very readable volume! It would be very helpful to students or anyone interested in the real day-to-day details of life on the seas or the waterfront in the 19th century."
5,Cute little cookie cutter,I made quite a few cookies over the holidays and this cutter came in very handy. I like the shape and size.
5,Great Band,"I happened upon this band by accident, but am very glad I did. They have a very eclectic sound mixing jazz, brass and hints of base hip-hop infused with a unique and stylish sound. I love every song on this album and am buying more of their music. If you want something different that you can listen to at practically any time, this is a great CD!"
3,Gaming with her,"I got to this game at a time I was looking for something I could play with my girlfriend, as she isn't fond of shooters. The demo alone was loads of fun, best of all, the loved it!So I went for the full game. Colourful graphs, more funny home-grown weapons (which can be upgraded) and lots of action killing (?) the undead. It's a pretty straightforward game which was worth every penny when my girlfriend, who doesn't like gaming, asking 'so, are we playing Monster Madness today!?'.Sadly, the game looses interest once you've finished it once, despite the side games (which are independent from the main one)."
3,Good Choice for a 4 PLAYER PS3 Party Game,"Monster Madness: Grave Danger is an excellent choice for multiple players. It's kind of a top-down, fly-behind, 3 person, shooter & masher for 4 PLAYERS at once -on the same screen. None of that nauseating split screen nonesence that cut your screen realestate in half. A lot like Gauntlet.If you're like me -it's difficult finding a ""Party Game"" for the PS3. A Party Game being a game that multiple people can play and have fun at the same time. There's Rock Band (which is awsome), and then the rest are mostly fighting games for two players.Parents may think twice about letting little ones play this because it's a zombie-shooter with cartoonish gore. The gore however is minimal and the game is tounge in cheek cartoony.As a single player game, i say 3 outta 5. It's fun, but more fun with friends."
3,Monster Madness,Worth $[...] to kill some time with multi-player playability. Simple to learnWorth only $[...] if just trying to enjoy the game by oneself.
4,a wonderful reference for ritual,"this book is a fabulous resource for women seekingceremony in their lives. there are rituals to cover the every-day life events, as well as the holidays like samhain andbeltane. the book is handwritten by the women of thefeminist spiritual community and gives the feel of manydifferent personalities. the april fool's ritual is especiallyfun, and gives a good balance to the more poignant and seriousrituals."
1,I bet you can't finish it.,"I am the first to review this book for the simple reason that no one has read it. It is a very long, and confusing book...a waste of paper, ink...and a chunk of my life that I will not get back."
3,"Great sound, but where are the HD2 stations?","First, to clarify a prior comment: You can change the display settings so the front panel text can show the (a) album, artist and song title, or (b) station info, or (c) no info. The text will scroll when there are more characters than can fit.My big question is how do you tune to the HD2 stations?Yes, it will play HD FM stations, but in the NYC suburbs where I live our nearby stations have multiple HD channels. As near as I can tell, this radio only plays FM (analog) or the HD1 channel."
3,What is it with Africa?,"I've always been a big fan of ER. I am currentrly collecting all of the seasons I now have 1-9 and hope to aquire 9-12 and then 13-15 when they become available. Like the other revievers have said the ""Africa"" eposods really add nothing of value to the show. If ""DR. Carter"" wanted to leave the show the writers should have elimated his role insted of contuining with going back abd forth betewwn Africa and chichago. despite a few negativies I was always and will always be an avid ER fan so I intend to continue collecting every season"
2,No more spanish subtitles. Why?,Why since ER:The Complete Seventh Season there is no spanish subtitle? A lot of costumers let to buy this serie for this reason. Or am i wrong?
2,Get The Hell Out of Africa Already!,"I love ER, I plan on getting every season but these Africa episodes are BOOOOOOOOORING and like one of the other reviewers said, adds NOTHING to the season or the flow of ANY story line, I have watched all of these africa episodes in previous seasons but I was easily distracted around the house when they were on with no regrets whatsoever, this is why this season gets a 2 star rating even before it's even released.My Girl and I hate these Africa Episodes and will be glad when they no longer exist on an ER season disc set but they are no problem for her.........they put her right to sleep."
5,Great!,"Love this season, it's worth getting the only think I didn't care for in this season is the Afria episodes. Amazing other then those episodes. Season Finale has a huge cliffhanger which makes you want to watch the next season."
4,"good, cheap but no women",A good - and very cheap - collection of British World War I poets. The introductions could have been more detailed - but I guess for one dollar you can't expect too much. What disturbs me more is that just one woman has been included. The editor disregarded a lot of interesting poems which deal with female war experiences.
2,There are better products out there,"The On/off control for this LED light is hard to operate. It has a pressure-sensitive button which requires a lot of pressure to turn on the light. The finger tires, the LED light turns itself off when you may still need the light on. Look at Garrity- and other keychain light models before buying this one."
1,edited version NOT described in product info! Shame on you Amazon!,"This film by Wicked Pictures was not intended for cable TV. The version I received prominently displayed a sticker claiming this was a ""cable version."" We all know what that means, snip, snip, and the good footage hits the editing room floor. Amazon didn't seem to think that this would be information worth passing on. So why would you buy a Wicked Pictures dvd if the intent of the film was left on the floor? You might as well go to your local rental location and get a dumbed down version of whatever. Very bad decision by Amazon to try to slip a heavily edited dvd under false pretenses. Amazon, be honest an say that this dvd has been chopped up in your product definition. Do you look for books that say unabridged and get a pamphlet and think that's OK? This was a scam!"
1,Dangerous product!,I ordered two of these frames to display two posters. Both pieces of glass broke while gently handling them trying to place the glass back in the frame after cleaning. The glass is very thin and brittle. I have never had a piece of glass snap like that in my hands before. Very scary! And it happened twice!!
5,Insightful and Helpful,"I was fortunate to attend Kingdomality training a few years ago and couldn't wait to read the book - I wasn't disappointed. It provides insight into personality types in the context of an easy to read (and remember) story. When I meet new people, I often suggest that they take the free personality preference profile at Kingdomality.com and let me know the results. This is not only a great ice-breaker, it helps me to understand others and improves the quality of my interactions - having the book is a great resource and reference...you'll love it!"
2,"Interesting idea, so-so execution, terrible reading in the Audio book","Here we go again, another personality classification system and the author's premise that if you can stereo type people you can manage them more effectively. I don't see what this system has over other personality classification systems, such as MBTI (which has been around longer and more people seem to be familiar with).The book tries to be humorous, but it just didn't work. The story telling wasn't bad, but I'd almost rather listen to nails on a chalk board then listen to the voices of the people reading this book.Bottom line. I learned a little, but not much and I'd like my money back."
4,"Fun, if a bit soft","I found Kingdomality through their online quiz (www.kingdomality.com) and bought the book when I saw it.It's a nice story, if a little bit soft, but it does show how different personality types can interact. The advice is useful at work, at home, with various friends.Plus it's a lot more fun than poring over pop-psychology jargon."
5,Great Way to Learn Contemporary Israeli Hebrew,"Growing up, I was exposed to many different kinds of Hebrew learning materials, but this is the absolute best I've seen yet that teaches modern Hebrew as spoken by the everyday person on the streets of Tel Aviv. Presenting vocabulary and phrases a person will actually use on a daily basis (along with trendy Israeli slang), this book is a great guide to learning contemporary Hebrew. One criticism: I love that there is minimal English in these materials (lending to a more ""immersion"" experience), but the English that does show up on some pages has quite a few misspellings. Hopefully, later editions will have better editing, in that regard.But if it's contemporary Israeli Hebrew you want to learn, this book (which is the 2nd in a series) as well as the audio CD's are the perfect way to go! B'hatslakha!"
5,cute stuffed animal,"Our 1 year old loves this ""bunny bear"". It's really one of the softest stuffed animals I've felt. We have three identical ones just in case she loses hers."
1,This product did not match description.,"This product does not match the description: Pajama Bear - 12"". I have the 12"" Bear, but wanted another one for my other daughter and what I received is a bear that may have been 6 inches tall...12 inches if you stretched it out. Extremely disappointed, but decided to keep it because it wasn't worth my time to go through the return process."
5,Great Bear,Great. I had looked all over for this Bear and was unable to find itGetting it before Christmas was super. Thanks.
4,A good approach,"This is a math book. It tells you cryptography-related abstract algebra, number theory, etc. The good thing is it doesn't assume you have much math background.On the other hand, it has a lot of errors. Some are just typos, some not. Personally, I think if a math book has a single math error (wrong lemma, incorrect logic, ...), it is not a qualified math book. Unfortunately, this book has more than one.The reason I still give it four stars is that I like its approach. Without math, cryptography is not cryptography. If you don't have enough math background, this book really helps you get started. There are simply not many choices on the market of this kind. After reading this, you can go to more rigorous, advanced ones, such as Koblitz's series. An alternative (more rigorous, less abstract algebra) is Bauer's. All Koblitz's and Bauer's are excellent."
3,Has potential but needs alot of work,"Had this book for an introductory cryptography course. While this book has alot of potential, it was found to contain many, many errors (typographical and mathematical). I would also encourage the author to include many more examples when introducing new concepts. The theory is provided but every section seems to lack any sort of application of the learned theory. Finally, there are some weak solutions in the back to a selection of exercises, it would have been nice to see complete solutions as opposed to the numbers. The numbers mean nothing if one cannot figure out how to draw a similar conclusion."
3,Good introduction. Simple explanation. Very bad exercises.,"The book contains quite a good introduction to Cryptography. I was really impressed by its easy-to-read introduction to Quantum Cryptography, which seems to be a topic on which many other books struggle with providing a good explanation. Despite its clarity, the low quality of the exercises at the end of the chapters illustrate clearly the fact that the author did not put much effort or time into crafting good questions. This is really unfortunate since textbooks like these are supposed to help students learn more about the topic and the only way that could happen in a mathematical field like this is when they have well-designed questions to attempt solving.If you just need an easy-to-read-through introduction to Cryptography, this book is a pretty good choice. If you want more exercises to sharpen your skills or understanding, this book is not for you."
2,Difficult to understand,"I took this course at the U of Minn (where the author is a professor). He has a reputation of being a good professor and a good guy (and I have no reason to doubt it). Unfortunately, his book is very hard to understand. While packed chock full of information, it is written in a **very, very** dense style. It makes a lot of assumptions about your prior knowledge and there are few examples to illustrate the theory. While this may be OK for a grad student in math (or even a bright senior), it is definitely not sufficient for a non-math major and most undergrads."
1,CONTAINS LEAD!,I am so happy i came across the FDA study that tested many companies for lead. This was one that contained lead. I guess they all do which is rather sad. I opted to go with a different company that has zero lead: Vita Lea by Shaklee.And just to add I was taking this for a week and it made me extremely nauseous that is what ultimately made me research prenatal vitamins and then I saw the FDA study randomly online. Good luck!fda.gov/Food/FoodSafety/FoodContaminantsAdulteration/Metals/Lead/ucm115941.htm
3,I ordered the Blue square and they sent black,"It is a regular L square, nothing remarkable about that. I have four or five of them. Can never have too many of these on the jobsite. I just wanted the blue anodized to match my blue 72"" and 48"" levels and my Rafter square."
1,Does not work well with D28402K,"I recently purchased the Dewalt D28402K 4 -1/2"" grinder with this backer pad and a pack of 36-grit sanding pads (for refinishing a deck).Out of the box this pad will NOT work with the D28402K. The locking nut is simply not long enough to grab ahold of the spindle. The instructions were non existent but eventually I went to DeWalt's website to see if anyone else ran into this issue (before I started removing material off the backing pad to get it to fit).Apparently the fix is that you have to remove the washer and inner spindle on your grinder to get this POS to work.I'll be trying this after work today but this is total crap. Why would DeWalt require you to modify your grinder so that it works properly with a DeWalt backing pad?Makes absolutely no sense."
4,Missing instructions,"The instructions don't tell you that when attaching to the Dewalt 41/2"" grinder, you actually have to remove the washer assembly that you normally don't remove when using a regular grinding wheel. Easy to remove, and once done the backing pad goes on easily.I am about to use the tool to do some aggressive sanding and paint removal on my house gable trim. I'll give you and update."
1,Prepare to bow to your chinese overlords,Well as usual we are expected to buy more chinese crap and just accept the fact they will soon be our overlords.... This product did not fit my angle grinder(DEWALT D28402K ) without modification. Furthermore the hand tightened locking nut is shoddy at best to handle RPMs of 1200. This should have the same wrench tightened nut that the grinding disks have. I can already tell that changing the disks out will be a real bear....
5,Quality Product,This is one fine brush of the top quality that is expected and received from DeWalt. This handles rust and paint removal with ease. There are no flying pieces to cope with although it is advisable to wear goggles to assure safety. I have owned several brushes by other manufacturers but none provided the level of performance that this product offers. Excellent brush.
3,Not my preferred choice,"I purchased two of these and a DEWALT wire wheel (for angle grinders). I think the wire wheel is better. These cup ones vibrate. Maybe I'm being picky. Okay, different issue then. The nut on one of them is too tight. Another review said it was difficult to get off, but maybe that's a different problem. Anywho, I could get them both on one angle grinder but not another. On the other grinder one cup would go on, and the wire wheel would go on, but one cup wouldn't. I'm not cross threading. It goes on about 3/4 the way, and then the thread at the end interferes.Close to 4 stars but not quite. I can see why the others gave it 5 stars, but I disagree and would recommend something else first."
3,"Interesting subject, poor book","This is not a scholarly book, its analysis is non-convincing, and it obviously relies mainly on secondary soources. But the innately intersting nature of the story it tells makes the reading enjoyable."
3,Doesn't Fit a John Deere Garden Tractor's Steering Wheel.,"My better half ordered this for her mom who has a John Deere GT235. Evidently it was suppose to fit, but it doesn't. Overall though it seems to be of decent quality, but we've never used it."
3,well built,"This is a well-built spinner. However, it does not fit well on my car (Camry). It would be more appropriate for steering wheels with smaller spokes."
3,It's a convenient... piece of hose.,"It's just a piece of plastic hose. You could pick it up at any hardware store for less money. On the other hand, it's a ""no brainer"" - you can order this, it will show up on your doorstep, and you know it will work with the gauge. It's not so overpriced that the convenience is lost."
5,Truly fine interpretations,"These are truly fine interpretations of classic American country songs by a Scandinavian singer. His accent adds a quite special twist to the generally hackneyed versions that have been sung and sung by so many traditional C&W artists that the songs, and the music, have lost their freshness. Just try some of these. They are worth it. In fact, it is a shame that more of Alex's records are not available in this country. His ""Kend"" albums, once available on Amazon, seem to have disappeared -- a pity. Neat music!"
4,Lovely,"A fan of wooden combs, I was searching for a replacement when my last one broke. This is an excellent comb. Good ""hand"" placement and delightful designs across the top."
5,THESE DRAMAS TOUCHED ME AND MY CHURCH,I want people to know how much these dramas have touched my church group. We are greatly pleased with them. Does anyone know if he has more out there? He is probably the best we've read.
3,living Parables,"I was a little dissapointed as it contained exactly the same storys as Duckworths book ""Stories that sneek up on you."""
4,ARGUMENT RESOLVED,"MY GRANDSON PURCHASED THIS FLAGE TO PROVE TO HIS TEACHER THAT MAINE'S STAR WAS GOLD. HE WAS VERY ANNOYED BECAUSE SHE TOOK A POINT OFF FOR HAVING THE WRONG COLORED STAR ON THE FLAG THEY WERE REQUIRED TO COLOR. (SHE INSISTS IT IS RED). IT TURNED OUT THEY WERE BOTH RIGHT. THIS IS A VERY CHEAP FLAG FOR USE INDOORS. IT WOULD NOT STAND UP TO OUTSIDE WEATHER. HOWEVER, IT SERVED ITS PURPOSE FOR MY GRANDSON. HE ALSO BOUGHT ONE FOR HIS ENGLISH TEACHER WHO DID NOT HAVE A MAINE FLAG IN HIS ROOM."
3,"Good Music, Sucking CD Protections","I liked MiG on ""Rock Star"" and I was not disappointed by this album in terms of the music. In terms of the songs and his vocals, I'd give it 5 stars. However, I'm very very disappointed that I can't port the songs into my iTunes so I can put it on my iPod or play it on my computer more easily. I paid for it, I should be able to play it wherever I darn well please. So for that I give the CD 1 star -- stupid recording company DEECA. The result is the sad 3 star rating I must give this."
2,Was this his idea?,"I really loved this guy on RockStar INXS: he was an exciting performer with a gorgeous voice and fresh take on the classic music he was given. I loved him so much that I was predisposed to love this CD.And now, I'm disappointed. Mig has taken some great old rock songs (and some real schlock - seriously, ""Kiss From a Rose""?) and turned them all into interchangable easy listening dreck. Any of these covers could be the theme song for Dawson's Creek or One Tree Hill or some other teen angstfest on the WB. That statement alone should tell you everything you need to know about this CD.With any luck, Mig will be given the opportunity to release another CD, and he'll show us the genius I know he's capable of on that one. I'll be waiting hopefully.Two stars because the original songs are slightly less awful than the covers."
1,pure Disney. Suitable for children only.,"I have to say...I don't like the idea of writing a mean review about an album by a person who seems nice. I watched Rock Star: INXS. Mig's style is 100% harmless and Disney-esqe. He seems very nice and he's a decent pianist. His voice is clear and pleasing in a sort of Aladdin-On-Ice way. He utterly lacks the danger, edge, and style necessary for rock. This album of covers indulges that notion to the extreme. The first track is ""Baby, I Love Your Ways."" That's all that most rock fans need to hear in order to know they won't like it. The album is an overly-precious collection of pop and rock covers bereft of any grit. The cover of Pearl Jam's ""Jeremy"" illustrates this completely. Nice guy, good singer, but horrible taste and style in music. I couldn't abide the uniform 5-star reviews. I'm sorry."
3,Not As Good As I'd Hoped,"Let me be perfectly honest here, I saw MiG Ayesa ON Rockstar/Inxs and just fell for that goreous bod. I mean really! Where was he when I was working on loosing my virginity?Any way back to the main point. I loved his stuff on the show, it was hip, chic and whatever the current term is for ""really cool."" I know you're hearing a but here, and so here we go.... But.....It's slick, very slick, the CD... I loved the curvy edges of his voice and persona; they have been worn down to a nice slick little package. I wanted to hear something different, I wanted to really know him as an artist and not just as a pint-sized beefcake with a nice voice.Well, I'd say if you like a nice, slickly produced rock cover album this is your ticket. Buy away....Yours,Wendy46"
4,The Books that The Chronicle is based on,If you have been watching The Chronicle on the Sci Fi Channel then you know that these are the books that the series is based on. What you may not know is that the books are different than the series! The books have a girl reporter named Savvy and the paper she works at is not the World Chronicle. In this book Savvy investigates a story about a vampire. The story is exciting with some violence and a lot of strange things happening. but dont expect to see Tucker or the other people from the Chronicle! I can see how they got the idea for the tv show from these books but they changed a lot of things. The book is funny and I will read more of them.
2,Only OK,This book was only OK for me. It may resonate with you. I mean no harm to you by my rating.Namaste.
5,Unique and stupendous talent on a marvelous CD,"Short and sweet review...this will fill you up in a way that only Mme. Podles' other performances can. She is phenomenon. Her rich flexible voice, fabulous technique, and intelligent use of vocal color to convey character and emotion will not disappoint."
3,Worked pretty good for me,It worked well for me. I think the 1 star reviewers might not of been using a big enough air pump? I hooked it up to one side of a 6.5w pump that estimates 15 ornament (probably a very bloated number) and got a lot of bubbles. However only about half the wand was really bubbling so the rest I just dig into the rocks. My fish love it.
2,they clog very quickly and easily,"I have two of these and they both have become clogged, I haved tried soaking them in everything from vinegar to hydro peroxide...barely any bubbles and it actually fouled up my pump because no air was getting through. Nice idea and design I just wish they would produce for longer than a month."
1,PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK AS INDICATED,"I purchased this Bubble-Wall 48"" for my 55 gallon tank because my goldfish love to swim through the bubbles and the color (black) was very appealing since it wouldn't stand out like the blue ones. However, no matter what air pump I hooked it up to, the wand did not work. I am very disappointed and DO NOT recommend this product to anyone.Don't waste your money."
3,No connecting parts,"These bendable bubbler's are good and long lasting, I like them better than the air stone, however the description stated I could make it any size I wanted with the included connectors, however they were not in the package when it arrived, it also appeared to have been opened before and perhaps that's why it was missing parts. Will keep looking for a 5 or 6 inch size of this item."
2,Disappointing Kindle Edition,"It is unfortunate that I have to give a Ben Lambeth book two stars; but this excellent examination of the Kosovo air war has been let down by the incredibly poor Kindle edition.I will not add to the comments of the other reviewers that attest to the quality of this book's examination of the subject matter, other than to say that it is what we have come to expect from Ben Lambeth. It is a high quality insightful analysis of the full range of issues raised as a result of the NATO experience in Kosovo.Where I will add is to warn potential buyers off the Kindle edition until it is re-editted. Throughout the book there are a large number of paragraphs that have been cut off in mid-sentence, some even mid-word. This was a serious disappointment as such poor-quality editting would not be tolerated by RAND in their hard-copy editions. For those who wish to get an electronic version of this book for their Kindle I would recommend downloading it directly from the RAND website."
2,"Basic, but OK","This tape is a bit less than I expected, but it's OK I guess. A female voice directing the standard 'tense-then-release' method on one side of the tape. A male voice using a 'count-down' method on the other. The vocal is a bit robotic and the background music is a bit stiff too. I will admit that it has put me to sleep on a couple of occasions though."
3,Surprisingly satisfactory,"This is a *really* low tech automatic feeder, and I basically use it only for trips of 3-4 days, to feed reptile sticks to my turtle. While it is basically built very simply, and with lousy materials, and will dispense more over time as the amount of food in the feeder changes, it has served me well for about 10 (!) years of infrequent use (3-5 short trips a year). There are now an assortment of other products on the market; there where none when I bought this. So I can recommend it, but you can probably find better built and more flexible products (for less money) now."
1,Don't waste your money! (another bad review),"I bought this feeder because it was the only one available at my local aquarium store. I used it once before it broke. It's constructed out of cheap flimsy plastic pieces, so the food-adjustment slider broke in half right away.Since there is no kind of digital display or manual feed button, there is no way to know whether your feeder is working or not, or how much food is coming out per feed. Pretty scary if you're going on a long vacation. The only way I knew mine was broken was because I left it over a cardboard box for three days, and no food came out! I was looking for answers online, and found many similar complaints.I just bought a new feeder that seems to work much better:Feed Air Automatic Feeder - 5 1/ 4 in. x 2 1/4 in. x 2 1/2 in."
1,No regulation for amount released,"We had to move to a temporary home due to mold restoration and bought this so we wouldn't have to go back and forth, but it releases way too much fish food! It didn't work out for us, so unless you have a 100 gallon tank, it probably won't work. Save your money."
1,Very cheap quality!,This thing is basically worthless. Very difficult to assemble once you have the food loaded and then in order to test it for how much food will be dispensed you have to remove the batteries for at least 5 minutes after each test. A waste of $20...don't buy it!
1,worthless,"I will echo all the previous opinions:1 food clumps - but that may be expected in a humid environment. works Ok for a few days.2. Noisy - who cares. I only used it on vacation3. Dispenses food a bit unevenly. Using flakes, some feedings are too big and some are too small.All of the above are to be expected a bit, but worst of all, these things die almost as soon as they come out of the box. I actually have 5 of them because I was getting them very inexpensively and thought maybe I just got a bad one so I'll try it again.All 5 are dead with minimal use (just for my infrequent vacation). These WILL NOT LAST. You've been warned."
1,I don't recommend it.,"The 1st time I used it, it cycled about every hour. Fortunately I was testing it to see how much it dispensed, so I discovered the problem before it could cause problems in my salt water tank. It's cheap and it doesn't work."
5,My dog LOVES this toy!,"I had seen this toy that someone had stuffed a mouse inside of it. It has been very difficult to find this toy until I found it on Amazon. It is flexible enough for the dogs to play with in the house and soft enough not to break anything! Also, I found the stuffed mouse on Amazon and it has a chip that makes it squeak when it moves. Stuffed inside this ball, the holes are just small enough, the dogs can't pull it back thru and it gives them HOURS of play on a rainy day!"
2,too much prep!,"Buy used ! may be good for people willing to go the extra mile making them, but being a former cook, just too much for what""s inside."
2,poor quality shape sorter,"although this is a great item for learning numbers and shapes, i had four shapes in my package that were damaged or defective."
1,Good but don't order the bags,"The collector works great but you really don't need to buy the ""special"" bags for it as they are really just large garbage size bags."
5,Great product overall,"This product is as advertised. It provides a strong protective case for your 60 GB Video iPod. It fits very well. The openings for earphones is large, as is the Hold butten. I take the iPod out of the case when I charge it, so I agree with other reviewers that it could be nice if this opening was a door versus an opening. Otherwise, a fine product!"
4,I like it,This book arrived on time and is in fair condition. The cover is a little more worn than I expected and there is a lot of highlighting inside.
5,Excellent book,Great read. I received this book while studying Criminal Justice about 6 years ago. It was an eye opener on corporate greed and white collar crime. I still go back to the book from time to time. It gives a view of corruption you don't get from other media sources by providing an in depth background of different cases that have transpired.
5,Two Great Specials,Just received my copy of Lucy Gets Lucky/Three For Two yesterday. I must say the specials are really good. I haven't seen them since they were first aired in the 1970's.
2,Save your money,"These ""specials"" are anything but. Despite the big names, both episodes are disappointing. The writing isn't funny, and the actors have no chemistry. (Hard to beat Lucille with Desi.) No laughs. I'm still a Lucy die-hard fan, though."
3,"If you love Lucy, you'll love these specials.",It's nice to know that more Lucy specials are on their way. I love Lucy!
2,EXTREMELY SENSATIONALISTIC,"My family was close friends with Johnnie Ray from 1950 until his death. Many of the ""facts"" in this book are made up, or altogether wrong. It's very sensationalistic and gossip-y, and seems like it was written as part of the National Enquirer. I cannot recommend this book at all!"
4,I'm glad for the glimpse into the Cry Guy's life,"I've liked Johnnie Ray since the first time I saw ""There's No Business Like Show Business"" and was hooked for sure the first time I heard ""Cry"", so for me any and all information on him is worth reading. Whether the book has inaccuracies or not, I feel that I got a good sense of what Johnnie was about and am even more of a fan now that I've read this book."
1,"UPDATE OF YESTERDAY'S REVEW TITLED ""This Writer Doesn't Make Any Sense.""","Memo to whomever processes the review of this book I submitted approximately 13 hours ago on December 3, 2008:Can you please change the page number I cited from 286 to 256 ?Thanks ever so much. I quoted the passage correctly. Anyone can check that by finding the book at the library. But I goofed on the middle digit of the page number. The correct number is 256.Thanks again. Cordially, Miranda Ferrell"
2,Wrong color!,"The socks are probably nice socks, but I received the wrong color! I'm not sure whose fault it is, as I may have clicked the wrong setting because of the pictures that DON'T CHANGE or if I was simply sent them in error. Either way, I'm disappointed. Going back."
2,an ERROR on chapter1,"i have to say, that for someone who wants to use C# and directX this book is a one stop shop, i think that the general idea of this book totally hit the right point,yet, there are a lot a lot, of code errors, in the printed text,and when you get an error on the introduction chapter,(the ""device"" word),you may question, how seriously did these people take them selves,and, when you do not include an Appendix on how to install the SDK's...then with all respect, you cant say this is a book for beginners,if i was a beginner, i would probably leave the book, around chapter1 with the ""device"" error, and the assmupsetions of a working sdk.the book is very good, but everything around it is very very bad."
3,Book is chock full of errors,"This book is a decent learning tool, especially if you make sure to use the included CD. However, without the CD, you would find yourself completely lost, because the code written in the book is chock full of errors. It's almost as if nobody ever bothered to actually read the book prior to publication. The code on the CD compiles just fine, though, so if you want to learn from this book, you just have to double-check all of the code against what's on the CD."
3,Not Keyes' best,"I probably liked this book least of Keyes' books, all of which I've read. I think the problem was that I wasn't fully enamored of Maggie the way I am of the other Walsh sisters. It probably has something to do with the way she and her husband were portrayed in Rachel's Holiday, which I guess is unfair since that was Rachel's perspective on her sister and her sister's husband at a point in time where Rachel herself was very much in denial (yeah, I'm a little too involved with these characters).Still, it was a fun read. I had made a trip to California for similar reasons at about the time I read Angels, so that connection was fun for me. I just didn't feel quite as involved in this story as I have when reading Keyes' other books."
2,Come back Marian Keyes,"Oh, how I so wanted to like this book. Going back to her roots with the Walsh sisters stars of 'Watermelon' and 'Rachel's Holiday' and writing in the first person again - I thought that my favourite author may be back on track. But this installment just covered old ground. The beginning was like 'Watermelon' - how it feels to break up with a husband and running home to your parents, the middle a confusion of unbelievable friends doing bizarre and not very interesting things like 'Sushi for Beginners' and then the end, trying to be like 'Rachel's Holiday' but without the gorgeous Luke in it.I guess its true, even great authors only have a few good books in them. With Marian Keyes, the first three were exceptional and so I recommend them without hesitation. I'm afraid the rest will only ever be average chick-lit stuff. Still, I can't thank Marian enough for writing my favourite book of all time 'Rachel's Holiday' so I guess I'll just go and read that again instead!"
3,A Book Worth Picking Up,"Angels is a pretty good read from one of my favorite chick lit writers. I have just a couple of complaints. First, some of the story sidelines are a little ""out there"", not very believable or well-developed (i.e., Maggie's fling with Lara, which seemed kind of ""thrown-in""). My other complaint is that I felt it took a little too long to establish the basis for the crumbling of Maggie and Garv's marriage. Although the tragedy was woven throughout the book, I would liked to have seen the author delve a little deeper into the emotions. But then again, I've always thought of Keyes' books as escapism chick lit with a message. I guess to go any further into the pain would make her work a different genre entirely.I did enjoy this book, and would recommend it to a friend. I'd give it 3 1/2 stars."
2,"All-in-all, a fun book that was quick and easy to read.","I tend to take these British chick-lit books far more seriously than the author intends, so I purposely read this one with an open mind and light heart. The fun, snappy style of writing made me laugh, and although I didn't sympathize with the character's plight very closely, I found them to be quite likeable people.Even though I am a New Yorker, I have a few friends who live in Los Angeles and have visited there several times, so I really appreciated this rather cynical view of their town and their lifestyle."
2,I agree with Ranson,"100% agreement with Ranson's review. This book is about the most boring of the Walsh sisters. I don't understand why she picked this sister when she had the two fun ones left! Not only that, but I think that Marian's observations of Southern California were pathetic. She did a horrid job of capturing the lifestyle and environment of California. Stick to the European side of the world that you know better OR do more personal research of the area you intend to write about, Mrs. Keyes.My recommendation is to skip this one and read ""The Other Side of the Story"". Marian did a knock out job on that book. Or just go back and read Lucy Sullivan and Watermelon a few more times and wait for Marian's next novel."
3,Average beach read,"This was not the most dynamic book I've ever read, but it kept me entertained during a few Starbucks visits. Its good if you want something quick and light. Not Keyes' best."
3,Life in the fast lane,"After Maggie realizes her nine year marriage to Garv is over, she packs her bags and heads to glitzy-glammy Los Angeles to stay with her best friend, Emily. Whiling away the days soaking up the California sun, Maggie lets her hair down and steps out of her ""plain yogurt"" personality. She lives it up in LA's fast lane, taking chances on the wild guy, faking as Emily's assistant, and even contemplating a lesbian relationship.However, even in LA, the sun can't stay out forever, and Maggie's parade is rained on when her kooky Irish family decides to show up in California for an unexpected visit, she runs into a long ago boyfriend and Garv shows up wanting answers.Buckle up as you head down the California expressway with Maggie and her crazy LA friends in Marian Keyes' novel, Angels."
4,fun page turner,"Read this in one sitting....stayed up late last night and enjoyed every bit of it. Good book about friendship and figuring out what's important. Also liked that it showed all sides of the Hollywood lifestyle, and realistically portrayed its ups and downs. Only flaw was the flashback scenes to her marriage.....totally slowed down the story, after one or two, I just skipped the rest of them."
4,A Fun Read,"Marion Keyes always gives us a good, solid romantic comedy--one with empathetic heroines, humorous stories and satisfying endings and Angels certainly continues in that vein. Maggie Walsh moves from Ireland to LA after her marriage falls apart. While in LA, she contemplates plastic surgery, lesbianism, young men with goatees and other amusing topics (or they are when she contemplates them). The novel is filled with plenty of amusing characters and entertaing jokes. Reading Maggie's first-person narrative is like catching up with an old friend. The novel is not, however, as strong as Rachel's Holiday and Watermelon. Those two were much more funny. Still--Angels is a fine romantic comedy."
3,a bit disapointing and somewhat forced .not her usual stuf,"I was quite excited to get my hands on this book having devoured all her previous works .. rachel's holiday was by far my favorite and last chance saloon was also good .. this book started out slow and seemed forced, the main character as well as incidentals weren't drawn very well and you never felt that attachment .. still a good read, but not of the caliber you've grown to expect from her"
4,marian keyes is awesome,"i live for new releases from marian keyes. when i was in the UK last summer, i picked up all of her books that hadn't been published in the states yet. much to my surprise, they published Angels at the same time in both countries! after reading about claire and rachel, i eagerly anticipated reading about the ""good"" walsh sister. maggie is a very realistic character facing problems that women deal with every day. keyes has written another winner, keeping the reader glued to the pages while laughing out loud. i highly recommend this book and i can't wait until keyes writes about the hilarious anna and helen. (US readers - keep your eyes peeled for sushi for beginners!)"
1,Clueless in L.A.,"Wow. I've enjoyed Keyes' other books, but this one is really not good. The look at L.A. is completely cliched in an outdated, 80s New Agey sort of way, and it's achingly unfunny. Keyes also attempts to spoof the Hollywood production scene without knowing a thing about how the town really works. (Marian, honey: if a producer has read your script, he doesn't ask you to come in and pitch it to him. He read it. He knows what it's about. Pitches are for scripts you haven't written yet and would like to get money to write). If this book were any fun at all, one might overlook Keyes' wild inaccuracies about how people in L.A. live, eat and shop, but the characters are uniformly shrill and unlikable. This one is a disappointing chore to get through. Hoping Keyes' next book will have her back in the delightful form of ""Last Chance Saloon"", ""Rachel's Holiday"" and others."
5,Marian's Best One Yet!,"I have read of of Marian Keye's novels to date, and this one was so great! the way it made fun of Los Angeles (where i live) was dead on perfect! The Walsh family is so colorful, i just hope novels focusing on Helen and Anna are on their way!!Read this book you will love it!!"
3,Duller than most of Marian keyes books!,"I am an avid Marian Keyes reader but, Angels just did not have the same appeal. It seemed as though Marian keyes was running out of story lines when it came to the Walsh girls. Because Claire (the sister in Watermelon her first book) also left her husband for having an affair. There was truly potential in this book but overall it was a disappointment! I would Strongly recommend: Rachel's Holiday, Watermelon, and Last Chance Saloon. But, I would say to pass on Angels and Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married."
4,Awesome Keyes,"Another fabulous Keyes creation! If you love Marian, you'll love Angels. Classic, well written and touching. Will put a smile on your face!"
2,Heroine unsympathetic,"I got 2/3 through and realized I didn't care about ANY of the characters in the book. It ought to have been interesting. I'm interested in Los Angeles and the film industry, but my interest wasn't captured by this heroine or her story."
3,ok but not my favorite,"This is my very first Marian Keyes novel. I found myself struggling to finish the book in the beginning maybe because it was hard to relate to the character and the way the author was trying to introduce the ""supporting"" characters slowed down the phase of the story. I normally would go through a book in 2 or 3 days bt this had me going for almost 2 weeks. Also I had decided to stop reading it twice 'cause I thought I'd never find anything interesting in it at all. But I'm glad I decided to stick to it. I did find some interesting parts towards the end of the story. I liked the ending too. There is nothing like a good ending. I think it made up for the bad parts of the story. It's what salvaged the entire thing. Maybe I'll give Marian Keyes another chance."
3,Trust this author,"Initially, I had difficulty getting into this story. Little was revealed about Maggie's relationship with her soon to be estranged husband. The flight to LA seemed precipitous given what little we knew about Maggie. This scenes in LA were a bit overdue, especially all the trite dialogue with superficial characters. Fortunately, the story emerged beneath the fluff. Keyes writing is honest and deep. She is at her best when she juxtaposes humor with dark, psychological element to expose her characters' nature."
2,Disappointing effort,"Keyes ventured into formulaic territory in this novel. The usual complexity of characters and relationships in her past efforts (Watermelon, Rachel's Holiday) are lost in this book reminiscent of the Bridget Jones' Diary chick genre. Not funny or original - stick with her previous novels!"
5,Entertaining and Touching,"I just finished this book and enjoyed every page. It is funny yet touching at the same time. It is nice to see the ""bad girl"" side of a ""good girl""."
4,A Cute and Fun Beach Book,"I bought this book after having read Keye's Rachel's Holiday, so I knew what to expect- a light, silly, beach read. In the book, Maggie, the main character, leaves Ireland after her marriage falls apart and moves to California to live with her best friend. While there she learns about Hollywood and the movie industry and experiements as she trys to break her good-girl image. Although the book is lengthy, it is cute, and goes by fairly fast. It is definately a fun summer read. I would reccomend this to anyone looking for a fun, not extremely intellectual, beach book."
2,Fly Away Angels,"I was shopping for a light summer read with and found Angels, by Marian Keyes with the phrase ""Best Bet"" boldly emblazened on it. I read it, but it is pretty lackluster. The outcome seems predetermined at the start. I was hoping for funny characters with an edge. If you enjoy a quirky ""sit by the pool"" summer novel, find one by Olivia Goldsmith, Carl Hiassen, or Randy White. These are the masters of odd but endearing characters."
1,Not Keyes' Best,"I have read all of Marian Keyes' books and enjoyed each one more than the other. I was especially looking forward to reading Angels as it featured the Walsh sisters from her previous novels. What a bitter disappointment. I literally had to force myself to finish it- boring, slow, not a drop of her usual humor, stale characters...I just started Sushi For Beginners, and already I can tell this is the great writing you expect from Marian Keyes."
3,Entertaining and quick read,"Maggie Walsh Garvin's world is falling apart. She's had two miscarriages, her husband is cheating on her and she's lost her job. She leaves Garv and goes home to her funny and disfunctional family. When her friend Emily, a screenwriter, invites her to visit in Hollywood she goes. Emily is having a crisis of her own, her agent is not returning her calls, she can't sell a script, her lovelife is a shambles, and she is running out of money.This book follows both of them as they find themselves in the most unrealistic place in the world. Maggie is not too believable as a good girl gone crazy, but you want to believe. It has a happy ending and passes the time, but I don't think I would buy another in this series."
5,Kicks A**,What can I say... in my world Marian Keyes (along w. Lisa Jewell) can do no wrong. Perfect as always!!
5,Another great from the Irish genius!!,"I think Marian Keyes is my hero! I wish she would release a book every week!When Dubliner Maggie catches her husband cheating, her world is thrown into despair, even though she saw that the end was nigh before it happened. Cue a 'mad' decision to try LA for a while with her best friend, Emily, a few unexpected revelations about her past, more crazy happenings and , ultimately a happy ending.Any writer who can make me sympathize with a cheating husband, is pure genius. READ THIS AS SOON AS YOU CAN!!"
1,Worst book I ever finished...,"I have probably had worse books in my hands, but usually if it is this bad I either skim to the end or just plain put it down. From some reason, I felt compelled to finish this one...maybe to see if there was a story to it. I could have saved myself 2 weeks of struggling through it and just read the first and last chapters! I am so disappointed with myself for wasting the time.And apparently it wasn't written for a US market, because the author felt the need to 'translate' almost every expression or action to an apparently Irish audience.Anyway, unless you REALLY feel the need to read EVERYTHING this author has penned (I haven't read any of her other works), you might want to pass on this one"
4,Oops! Marian Keyes does it again........,"Angels is the latest installment in the sagas of the Walsh family. Many of her novels are about the Walsh daughters. This one is about Maggie. Maggie's in her early thirties and her marriage is in shambles, she finds out her husband is cheating on her and flees Ireland to stay with a friend in Los Angeles. Most women will enjoy this novel and be able to relate to Maggie's emotions and life complications.Although the book is well written & entertaining, I would recommend Last Chance Saloon or Watermelon (also by Marian Keyes) for a superior reading experience....."
5,A good summer read,"I read this book while I was in Ireland this summer. I knew it would be a light read, and I wasn't sure if I would like it, but I loved it. Now, I want to read all of Keyes books because I know I will enjoy them just as much. I live in L.A., and yes the Los Angeles in the book is cliche, but it is worth the read. So pick it up today!"
3,I wish it could have been better....,"I really wanted to love this book. And I did like it. The Walsh characters are just that, and you want it to be all the things you know Ms. Keyes can make it. But again, it never seems to get to the point. I was glad of how things ended up for Maggie;surely this could have happened earlier in the book. I feel that Helen is by far Ms. Keyes favorite character, but she wears thin quickly with me. Still, ""Rachel's Holiday"" and ""Is Anyone Out There"" remain two of my favorite books. This one is just...ok."
2,You can wait. Trust me.,"You'll be innocently browsing in a bookstore (virtual or otherwise) when suddenly, the new Marian Keyes novel will catch you out of left field. The cover will glow and wink at you enticingly, saying ""Go on, blow the budget - buy the hardcover, leave work early today & binge read till midnight - you know you want to"". But be warned. This novel lacks the wit, charm and unforced pathos of Keyes' earlier work (in particular Watermelon and Rachel's Holiday). Wait for the small paperback or buy it used."
5,GREAT READ,"I love this book - it was very well written, funny, entertaining, and quick. Marian Keyes is known for her light humor and her entertaining way of telling a simple story. She inspires women to grow up and put themselves first when a tragic life experience happens - like a cheating husband. Great read & very inspiring."
1,Disappointing book from a great author,"I absolutely love Marian Keyes' earlier books, my favourite of which is Rachel's Holiday. However, after Last Chance Saloon, I have found all of her subsequent books to be formulaic, predictable and quite simply disappointing. Angels is no different. The one and only reason I continued to read the book is because I have always found the adventures of the Walsh family (detailed in Watermelon and Rachel's Holiday) to be hilarious, and I hoped the book would pick up at some point. It didn't, and when it came to the point that Maggie has a same-sex experience simply ""because"", I thought enough.Anyone who has not previously read Marian Keyes should NOT start here. Instead, pick up Watermelon, Rachel's Holiday, Last Chance Saloon or Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married."
2,Angels very disappointing; slow going,"Very disappointed with this Marian Keyes effort. I physically laughed out loud with other stories by this author - particularly Rachel's Holiday. This book is definitely about the less interesting sister! Don't bother with this one, sorry."
3,"Eh, if you have nothing else...","I was going on vacation and needed a light book to read. I love Marian Keyes, and for some reason I had this book sitting on my shelf for the longest time. I was hesitant to read it given the sub par reviews, but I decided to take it with my anyway.Well, it definitely was a light and quick read. At times I thought to myself no wonder this book didn't have as many great reviews- or as many reviews in general compared to other Keyes' books. Overall, it was average, a bit disappointing coming from such a magnificent writer."
2,It Depressed Me!,"This book is not really all that interesting..the beginning just drags on! This is my first book to read by Marian Keyes..and it's kind of putting me off any of her other books. It seems like everyone is just going round and round..I am having to force myself to get through this book. I read these fluffy fictional books for fun, and lift me up..but this is practically depressing me with it's round and round talk with no end in sight..geez."
3,not as fun as her other books,"If you are a Marian Keyes fan (I am) and occasionally want to pick up one of her books for a fun read (I do) then I just want to warn you that this is not the book you want. I agree with other reviewers in that I didn't really care about the characters like I expected to. It wasn't bad, but the best I can say about it was that it was just okay."
4,Bland but still entertaining,"I loved all Marian Keyes books. However, i must say that Angel is a bit bland. The story plot is pretty simple. Maggie the simple, plain jane with no history of any diva genes unlike her sisters lead an ordinary blissful married life. But suddenly, it all crumples and she went to her bestfriend`s house in Los Angeles to recuperate. There she found a wild side of her that she has never known and becomes a changed person. In the end it ends happily with her husband coming back for her. What attracts me more than the story in this book is los angeles. Ms Keyes has done a wonderful job covering the los angeles hollywood lifestyle."
3,Just ok,"I love marian keyes's books this one was good and I still enjoyed it I just didnt ""love"" it as much as her others. If you are looking to dip into her writtings for the first time try watermellon or Last chance Saloon. Those are my fav. I supose it just felt like a generic plot and story line."
4,Touching and Funny,"I usually read genre fiction, like science fiction, fantasy, and romance. But even though I'm not normally one for mainstream, ""chick-lit"" novels, I found this one to be really quite good. The main character was interesting and complex, and I was moved by her journey of emotional healing. Also, the ""fish-out-of-water"" aspect of an Irish woman coping with life in L.A. was just downright hilarious! This book was moving and funny by turns, and sometimes simultaneously. Highly recommended."
2,Not Marian Keyes' best effort!,"I have read all of Marian Keyes' novels and would give them all 4 to 5 stars for enjoyability, but this novel just did NOT grab me at all. I found it boring and didn't think it accurately described Americans. I enjoy her novels for their escapism into London and Dublin life...this just made me want to finish it so I could continue my claim that I'd read them all. Dear readers, PLEASE don't choose this as your first Marian Keyes read. Try reading them in order of publication...she is truly talented and funny in her other efforts, this one just fell short in my opinion."
4,"Good but not as good as ""Rachel's Holiday""","I have read all of Marian Keyes's books and was eagerly awaiting the third installment about the Walsh family. ""Angels"" is about the sister the others all call ""the brown-noser,"" Margaret and her universally hated husband, Paul (otherwise known as Maggie and Garv). The portions of the book that deal with Maggie and Garv's relationship, particularly with that of their loss, are beautifully done. However, much of the book takes place in L.A. where Maggie's friend Emily, a screenwriter, lives, and that's where the book (in my opinion) drags a bit--much of Maggie being gobsmacked over those Angelenos and their strange ways. But all in all, Keyes is as entertaining and perceptive as always. She employs the literary device of slowly letting the character reveal things about herself the more you, the reader, get to know her, and it is effective and holds your interest. Plus, it's always wonderful to read more about the Walsh family (especially Helen)!"
2,Not what I expected,This book wasn't nearly as fun or cute as the cover looks or says of the book. Sophie Kinsella has this author hands down.
2,Agree with Brooke- Keyes has done MUCH better,"I don't know why Amazon.com didn't take my first review, but my point is summarized by a few other low rating reviews. It was a bore. The plot was slow. Keyes tried to make Maggie (the main character) seem boring, and, instead, made the whole book boring. All of her other books were great, and I expect when she gets to the last two sisters, we are in for some great reads. Just skip this one. Read Anne Maxted and wait for the next Keyes book."
3,The End Was The Best!,"It took me forever to complete reading this book. It wasn't until the last 100 pages that I actually enjoyed it. Three-quarters of the book seems to repeat itself making it a bit boring and hard to get through.The setting for the book is in Los Angeles. I live in Southern California and I feel that Keyes really exagerated what she ""imagined"" L.A. is like. Some of what she writes does happen but so much is sterotype ... things we may have heard or seen on an ""Entertainment Show.""I am a first time Keyes reader so I wasn't familiar with all of the chartacters. Keyes does have knack for writing colorful and enjoyable chartacters.Maggie, the main chartacter, was given just about every senerio life can bring ... Marriage,pregnancy, miscarriage, abortion, divorce, affairs, lesbiansm on and on .... To much! I guess that is why it is called fiction."
5,TAKEN BACK IN TIME TO A PLACE OF SERENTITY,"I purchased this CD, upon a recommendation from a friend. I hadn't heard a bit of it. Hopped into my truck and was only half way through the first song and the tears are running down my face. I hadn't anticipated the deep emotional connection to the DIVINE in us all. I had not anticipated that I would be thrown back through time, to the pure ancient wisdom of the Indian spirit.Mr Fein has somehow captured their essence and beauty. The melodies are hauntingly beautiful and breathtaking. I am not of North American Indian decent, but felt privy to be listening to something which surely must have been sacred. Annie"
4,Good price,They work well. They just don't last long enough though maybe the metal-cutting is arduous so it's to be expected.
5,DEWALT DW4856 6-Piece Metal/Woodcutting Reciprocating Saw Blade Set,Arrived prompt and when needed. Product was exactly what I needed to finish home improvement job. I would recommend company and product to any female needing this type of product. Easy to use and fun to use if you need a power saw.
5,Just as promised,The blades come in a useful plastic case. The tooth selection is good from everything from metal to coarse cross-cutting.
5,Seems good to me.,I don't know much about blades but they look really good. They will be a present for Christmas and I'm sure they will get a lot of use. Thank you!
4,Good product...fast service.,I am well pleased with this saw blade set...and was very pleased with the quick service. I would use this merchant again.
4,Great set,"This was a good compliment to the saw we just purchased. Just getting a saw, a kit like this was great."
3,Blades look good.,I had to send them back as I misread what they were. I thought they were 9 inch not 6 inches.
5,Excellent product.,"Outstanding blades, works as described. Recommend them to everyone, especially for the great price. Fits all saws. Dewalt makes a great blade."
3,DIY Quality,"I purchased with my first recip saw. Blades are OK, but not a very long life. Since I'm rehabbing an older house, I found myself replacing the blades fairly often. I have since tried the Lenox brand blades, and am much happier - I'm guessing 3+ times the life."
1,wrong author?,Not what I expected from a Jillian Hart book and the back of the book said it was by another author. How can you have a book with one author on the front and another with the copyright?
3,Past his prime,"These are really great compositions, but it sounds to me as if the singer's voice is quite far past its prime."
5,Breathe Right Strips,"I highly recommend the Breathe Right Strips to anyone with a night time breathing/snoring problem. I've tried other brands and always figure I'm wasting my money on anything but the real thing. The others don't stay on, and can be irritating at night."
4,Good Purchase,"Good product, acceptable prices (but a little high) and quick delivery.In Chile we have not this product, for this reason I needed to purchase it via internet in USA."
5,Night time bliss,"If you have a nose that will not work at night, try these. My nose is the about as stuborn as they come. I have to use hormone sprays, but the sprays do not work with out these fantastic little guys. Must try!"
5,I can breathe !,"Both my husband and I use these at night, so we get more restful sleep. They really help us breathe better. I even used one at the dentist the other day, to help me breathe while the dentist was working in my mouth. It was much easier to breathe. I love these nasal strips!"
3,Helped My Dad But Not Me,"My Mom and Dad recommended these nasal strips, along with using the Breathe Right throat strips. Apparently, this combination has been the only thing that has made my dad's snoring more tolerable for my Mom. My Mom was clear that I should try the ""Extra,"" and not the weaker versions of the nasal strips.However, after having used them for several weeks, I can't say I've noticed any difference in myself. They did open my nasal passages more, it's true, but they didn't help me with my snoring or not getting a good night's sleep.I guess each user is different. They may be worth your trying them: they worked (with the nasal strips) for my Dad, but not for me. They're inexpensive enough that they're worth a shot for anyone who has a problem with snoring or sleep apnea."
2,These do not work for plugged sinuses!!!,"I can see how these would work for someone with small nasal passages or nostrils that are a little ""collapsed."" However, if you suffer allergies or a cold which causes your nasal membranes to swell, don't bother getting these. They don't work, and if you think about it, they COULDN'T. If your membranes are swollen, you could prop your nostrils wide with tubes the size of silver dollars, and it won't help a whit. I have to give only 2 stars because all advertising related to this product indicates it works for allergies and the like, and that is blatantly false. I gave these a shot because I haven't had free breathing in a good 12 years. I hoped against hope these would help in even the slightest way, but they didn't at all. If you suffer congestion due to allergies or cold, save your money and save yourself the disappointment."
2,between art and science,"F. G. Bailey's 'Stratagems and Spoils' is a useful book for those who are interested in anthropology and/or politics. The book covers many aspects of political leadership in different societies and cultures. He is successful in making his readers convinced by drawing examples from his fieldwork in Orissa and from Fredrick Barth's study among the Pathans of the Swat valley. His 'hypothesis' that political leadership and its relation to the society is the same in all cultures is very well supported by his arguments. His writing style also deserves appreciation.However, the book would be more noteworthy if the writer had avoided repition and unnecessary elaboration of some cases and points."
3,Japanese,Book was not as instructional as I had hoped. I was expecting a little more of a text book but that is my fault as I didn't have much Japanese experience at that time.
5,The Best Saw Palmetto,I've been using this Solaray Saw Palmetto for more than 15 years. At 73 I can tell you that it has work great for me.
5,Great for the whole family,Everyone in my family uses this all the way down to the 2 yr old and never a problem
4,decent stuff,"Seems a little weak compared to Lito's first 2 videos. This one basically says that the skills from previous videos are still good for the ""new"" shaped skis (well of course).However the first two did not have this new school skiing demonstration. If you like to complete your collection, go for it by all means."
2,"Adds very little to Breakthrouhg On Skies I,","The info in Breakthrough on Skies III should be included in Breakthrough On Skies I. Much better to spend less money and buy, Expert Skier I by Harald Harb"
1,46 minutes into it still waiting for lessons...,"What on earth happened? The first two videos were excellent. Its now talking about how people to teach skiing go skiing on their days off. How bizarre. Whats his name says ""Im only in it for the poetry, an empty slope, effortless turns."" Thats fantastic but tell me why I bought this?"
4,Happy 60 plus intermediate skier,"I love the teaching technique and photography of Lito Tejada but this video is old - made in 1998. Most of what is shown is relevant but the lifting of the ski ""concentrate on lifting the heal of the foot..."" is no longer recommended. However, with that knowledge you can still learn a lot from this video and it is beautiful to watch. Also recommend Harald Harb's book for more updated information. Lito's book on Soft Skiing for older skiers states that ""I just leave both skis on the snow"". Wish Lito would put out a new DVD with his new techniques!"
5,This is the Breakthrough video to buy - watch it daily when skiing,"As this was filmed after the advent of shaped skis this is the best of Lito Tejada-Flores videos to buy. His graceful moves down the slopes at Aspen will inspire you.If you are trying to be a better intermediate skier watch this video every day and memorize the pictures. Then when you go down the slopes think of Lito and his wife and try to emulate them.Practise, watch, practise, watch, ... - over and over again. Every time I watch it I see something new. I must have watched it at least 15 times and the words get a bit tedious - but I'm never bored with the skiing technique.I'd get all three if you can afford it, but if you only get one, this is the most comprehensive and its not necessary to have the earlier videos to appreciate this one."
3,Get the first two and pass on the third,After watching the movie twice. I can safely say I would have rather simply purchased the first two. This movie makes many refrences to the first and second movies but fails to really provide any extra instructional details. The book however is a great read.
3,A little bit lacking in interest,"My son is not as excited about this book as he was with the Shapes book. There are not as many flaps to open, and there are not as many hiding places for Blue. Also, it is not as easy to find the clues, or to look for anything interesting. And where are all of the characters? The flaps in my book are also placed in bad positions. The one with the picnic basket tore off the minute I opened it because the score would not bend. Being so close to the top of the page, it ripped right off. Major design flaw."
4,Another Lackey original,"Unlike other reviewers, once in a reader's trance it takes a tank to pull me out. I certainly didn't notice any grammer or punctuation bobbles, because I found myself immersed in the world of rural WWI England.This richly detailed tapestry of small town life in rural England invokes all the senses. Lackey manages to bring a sense of time and place to life for me. Lackey's ""Elemental Masters"" series, which began with her re-telling of Beauty and the Beast in ""The Fire Rose"" through ""The Serpent's Shadow"" (Snow White), and continued through the obviously titled ""Gates of Sleep."" Phoenix may not rise to the level achieved by ""The Fairy Godmother"" (Alternate history meets the Brothers Grimm), but it's a good solid read.Sleep appears to be generally accepted as the weakest of the Elemental Masters series to date. This offering re-introduces the powerful characters and magics which Lackey for some reason avoided in Sleep. Lackey has recharged herself. -- Reccomended."
3,"read better, read worse","I've read most of Mercedes Lackey's books, and this one is ""eh"" it had it's moments of really good... but it was very predictable. I thought it actually would fit better with her works about the 500 kingdoms, because it was SO based on the fable of Cinderella. However, it was an interesting take on the cinderella story. The other books in the Elemental Masters Series all seem to be fairly unique plots, and I was hoping this would be the same. I found it disappointing."
2,Disappointed fan,"I'm more than 3/4 of the way through reading this book and all I can say is that I'm one very disappointed fan. I usually try and read every one of Mercedes Lackey's books but even I can't excuse the lazy, sloppy writing that's steadily creeping into her work. I love the basic idea and the main characters, but this is a perfect example of an author who seriously needs to start editing her work or paying someone to do it for her.There are entire pages of truly boring exposition where the characters (usu. Reggie) reminisce about people the reader will never meet and therefore won't ever care about. Stuff any good editor would've suggested be removed or shortened.Lackey repeats herself constantly especially about how no one ever notices Ellie walking past them. I think I got the point the first three or four times.And don't get me started on the the typos and missing punctation.A great idea, but an unpolished novel that I won't ever want to read again."
2,Disappointing and Tedious,"I normally love Mercedes' stories, but this one was tedious, repititious, and extremely predictable. I found myself skimming over many parts of the book, ie. a description of every person Reggie could not confide in. The very interesting Aunts were only in a few pages. She went on ad nauseum about war and the men who perpetuate them. I simply did not enjoy this book. I'm sticking with Valdemar."
2,A Disappointing Revised Cinderella,"The theme of the Elemental Series is a retelling of classic fairy tales. Lackey sets this retelling of Cinderella in WWI England, in a world among magicians based on the classic 4 elements of eath, fire, air and water.The danger in choosing such a theme is that you need to *add* something to the retelling. In this instance, I unfortunately have to say Lackey fails.The social commentary on the class structures breakdown of Britian during WWI has been done many times. The characters were one dimensional, and the magical undertones don't add any special dimension to the tale.I hate saying this about anything by Mercedes Lackey, but this is one that can be given a pass."
2,Cinderella Meets Turtledove Meets Wodehouse...,"Another interesting turn from Mercedes Lackey. Although the book paints an engrossing portrait of WWI torn England, it is basically a retelling of the familiar Cinderella story. While I see where she was trying to go, the overall effect was spoiled for me by over the top aristocratic characters, Reggie in particular. One can only stand so many ""I say Mater!""'s in a book, after all.If you like the cozy feel of the Lord Peter Wimsey stories, then you will enjoy this book. If not, pick up The Fairy Godmother by Lackey, you will enjoy it much, much more."
2,Ok,I will not recommend this productcompared to all the products seen and value the price is good but it drains down in an hourin time shipping no complaints
4,Response to quack,"The reader from PA is a quack. There is no evidence, Venoma included, that proves Hopkins a Soviet spy! There were many in the Roosevelt Administration, especially in the Treasury Department, but among those closest to FDR Hopkins was not a spy.Hopkins' book is excellent and should be read in conjunction with the works by McJimsey, Tuttle, and Sherwood."
2,Horse of a Different Color,"The reviews listed on Amazon don't begin to address the fact that for most historians, and those living during the 1930's and 1940's, Harry Hopkins was Roosevelt's right hand man, and after reading the 1987 biography of Hopkins, it's very easy to come to the unestablished but logical analysis that it was all about Harry from 1935 when Roosevelt was elected until 1946 when Truman came into office. The attempt to discredit Hopkins or write him out of history is a big mistake, and the entire history needs to be done again with a view toward his very large role to prove or disprove the 1987 biography which doesn't say so, but doesn't have to say so, that Roosevelt would have been nowhere without the efforts of this close friend, inhabitant of the White House, negotiator, New Dealer, and operations genius behind the Roosevelt throne."
4,Harry Hopkins - Hero or Spy,"I'm writing this ""review"" to bring some clarity to the previous reviews. Supposedly, according to the book the ""Verona Secrets,"" Harry Hopkins was a spy. However, please note that this declaration seems to be the opinion of the far right. (Note the reviews on Amazon.com for the ""Verona Papers"" as well as the conservative internet zine NewsMax.com .) On the other hand, any knee-jerk hero worship is equally suspect. So draw your own view! But not from this book - its emphasis is pre- New Deal!"
5,WOW !!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is a wonderfully recorded CD- I place this recording with Reference Recording HDCD and Diana Krall recordings. Even though I don't understand one word, this recording is hauntingly musical. A++"
1,Toxic,"I went to Michael's the other day to purchase the exact same kit made by Milestone. In the back of the box in small letters was a warning that this kit included Portland Cement, which is known in the State of California to cause cancer. Now, why on earth would they put this in a child's kit?!!! That really upsets me!!!"
2,Wenger Watch,This Wenger Battalion III is a very nice looking watch but I've had a problem with it. I unscrewed the crown to change the time on it and I can't get the crown to screw back down. I called Princeton Watches but since it has been three weeks I was told to send it to Wenger. So if you get one of these check everything out before you put on your watch.
2,Not durable at all,"I expected a lot more from Dewalt. This one fell apart on me in short order even though I wasn't beating on it. The knotted brush is fantastic, though. Buy that instead."
2,Get the knot brush instead,"Bought this from Amazon.Picture is not quite rightWires tend to come out easily, not really happy with it.Get the Dewalt Knotted Cup Brush instead!"
5,good brush cup will order more,"very well made not cheap, heavy good tool . I have used it so far gringing rust off of steel yard edging its pretty tuff"
5,A Wonderful Fantasy,"The author, Daniel Jason, takes you on a wonderful ride back in time where dragons and lake monsters are not myths, but a part of the every day nature of things. It is a wonderful story about love, friendship, desire, commitment and honor. A story that will melt the heartstrings of many woman, and change how men think, feel and react. It was a joy to read!"
5,stiff competition,"I build houses out of autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC), see www.safecrete.com for more on them. AAC is a very soft concrete product that is very workable. Any tool that will cut wood will cut through AAC many times faster. I use a sawzall a lot to cut electrical and plumbing chases and outlets. The short stroke of a recipricating saw creates much less dust than a circular saw or router.There are two reasons why these demolition blades work best for me. They are stiff. A thiner blade tends to curve inside the block when cutting. They have widely spaced teeth. AAC cuts so easy excavating the cut material is more of a concern. These larger wider spaced teeth offer better excavation of dust."
5,Very Useful Book!,I feel this is a very useful book after I carefully read it. This book discloses all kinds of strategies that can be used by the lottery players to better their chances of winning a jackpot. This book covers both the strategies of figuiring out the winning numbers and some of lottery systems or wheels. I have been playing lottery quite a fear years. I thought I knew pretty much about how to win a jackpot until I read this book. There are still many strategies I never even thought about. I wish I read this book earlier.
2,"As the name of the book suggests, it's just a guide","Anyone thinking that somewhere or somehow a startegy exists for predicting the outcome of a lottery will confirm by reading this book that such a thing does not exist. The book maybe helps you, through considerable time and dedication, to reduce the odds. But let's be honest, who is going to spend hours per week studying numbers and, if he is lucky, he gets a probabilty of winning equivalent to 1 in 20,000 rather than 1 in 500,000? Definetly not me."
1,"Embarassed, but I tried it","If only I could give it no stars...You know things are bleak when you buy a book like this. Like an idiot, I followed the tips religiously, and never won more than $5. If you have money to waste on the lottery, and you honestly find it fun, go for it. Just know that the lottery is dumb luck, plain and simple. If you're hard up on cash and in debt, don't look for a magic solution. Spend the money on a Dave Ramsey book, follow it closely, and better your life on your own... we'll be out of debt by April '11 thanks to him!"
2,Very little information,"This book does not have a lot of information about strategies. It offers very little. The author should of sliced off alot of the general stuff, and should of focused on the key points-strategies about improving ones odds. The book is not worth the price at all."
2,Little Helpful / Lot's of Commercials,The book does provide some logic by explaining comon wheel system and some other statistics. This information is available in other sources. There are dozens of pages which are nothing but commercials for the authors books and software. Not much is explained on the actual details on how to caluclate certain combinations. It's basically a big advertisment. Disapointing for sure!
5,Skiing with Lito,I have been using Lito's method for about 20 years. It has turned my wife and my skiing around 380 degrees. I'm over 80 years old and I'm going to Snowmass in January to be part of his ski school. I have even purchased several of his DVD's for friends.
5,yes you can break out of the intermediate rut,"Great video, excellent compliment to the book. Lito really has a method for teaching you the skills to become an excellent skier. He can tell/show you more than one way to learn each skill, and they really pay off. His book and videos are easily worth their price which combined is less than one ski lesson!!! All this from someone who thought they could always be an intermediate who can now ski the back bowls at Vail."
5,All about making carving turns,"The video may be a little bit dated (you may notice Lito does not ride the ""shaped"" skis in this), but he demonstrates skills that are 100% relevant. 5 stars definitely."
3,Okay if you like eating lamb.,I wanted more good 'ol American recipes and deserts. I will adapt recipes to my liking and you could too.A good price.
3,America Primitive Coda,"Long live American Primitive Guitar! I admit to loving Fahey's earlier work from 1959 through his LP ""Of Rivers and Religion"" and avoiding his more recent work especially the 'wall of sonic angst' music, but this album is worth hearing the old master's final work. Great renditons of Irving Berlin's 'Remember' and the Gershwin brothers' ""Summertime"". The somber guitar 'reverbed (?)' in the title cut, ""Red Cross, Disciple of Christ Today"" is brooding enough to make anyone who loved his earlier work happy with the Fahey imagination towards his last days. The CD package has inside a wonderful tribute by Glenn Jones printed as an early Christian pamphlet. ... The total CD timing is listed as 60 minutes but track 7 is only recorded for half of the listed 27 minutes. Buy the CD."
4,Punk Surf Rock,"I really don't know much about the bands or even the genre, but I like the surf rock sound played fast and loud. As it turns out this album provides that."
5,See my picure,"Amazon has the wrong picture, see mine.I've been using these for years.These are very durable and cut fast through any kind of wood.Good for Large branches, I even cut a 30 foot pine tree to the ground with one.I use it all year long and go through 2 blades a year.They will snap if you get them bound up in a bad way. Know where the weight of the branch/tree is going to go and cut from the opposite side. Use the 3 cut method for branches. Same rules as a chain saw. I use heavy leather gloves, safety glasses and helmet.""TIMBER"""
2,Sony Ericsson Battery review,"The first battery I received would not charge so I called and was sent another one. The second I received would not charge but I did not call I used an old battery I had, it would hold a charge for a day, I just let the matter drop."
3,Sony phone battery,"The first product I received from this company was used and didn't work. I was buying a ""brand new battery"". I contacted them through email, received a response within a few hours and two days later had a ""brand new"" working battery."
4,difficult follow up album,"This is a more straight forward offering than his previous, very successful Honey Steals Gold set. Still it works, the title track blowing me away for starters. A tad overpolished for my taste, still an essential Kuepper album, and one that is true to itself at the end of the day. I think Kuepper was nominated for an Australian Recording Industry award for best male performer the year this came out."
1,"Looks Good, but Very Disappointing","My sons were excited when they first received this as a gift. It never worked, though, even with my able attempts to help them. It amplified all noises, and made it impossible to hear the intended sounds, like people talking or birds chirping,etc. It didn't hold up for long, either, and my kids aren't very rough on their toys. Someone needs to come up with a much improved model."
5,GREAT,"I boght this for my little sis for her b-day and she said it was GREAT!She could hear me in my room talkin to my friends.it is really cool and i think all kids should buy this toy.BY THE WAY IT IS WONDERFUL,GREAT,AWSOME,SUPER and FUNERIFIC."
1,It's a dud,"I got this for my daughters who love to spy on me while I do exciting grown-up stuff (cook dinner, fold laundry, sweep, etc.) They love Wild Planet's Spy tools kit. This never worked so I returned it. Save your money."
4,It's fun for a while,"This is one of those toys adults enjoy just as much as kids. My niece and I play ""spy"" a lot, and this is one of our secret weapons. Surprizingly, it works pretty well for an inexpensive kids' toy. It's not so much fun that we play with it every day, but when we dig it out of the toy chest, we have fun."
1,Supersonic Ear,Ordered this item and it looks GREAT!Unfortuneately it did not work. Had a short in the button.Returned it and am awaiting refund. Good customer service.NOTE i repleaced this item through local merchants in my area and after the third one with the same problem we decided to not purchase this toy.
2,oh this isnt good,great for a kid but not a teenager. This doesnt listen through walls or windows. They say it goes 30 feet...actually 10. It's not meant to provide good results just enough for a kid to hear his heart beat.
5,Great Toy!!,"I don't know which kid enjoys it more (my husband or my son) but they get a kick out of it. The only fear is that my son will pick up on things that only adults should hear. I asked my son what he heard outside and he said that he heard big kids saying ""Hey, and then I heard a bad word."" It was cute the way he put it but since then, I limited his use of it to around the house and around close friends."
1,Stink-o-rama,"This toy is not at all what it seems to be, doesn't work well, and isn't fun. My son played with it for about ten minutes. Once he realized how NOT fun it was, he put it in his room. It has been in his drawer since Christmas.I don't know who the people are who are giving this toy a positive review. They must have stock in the company or something. For the rest of us, this toy is stink-o-rama."
4,Pretty cool for a kid,"My son has had this toy for a while and he still really likes it, and it hasn't broken yet. Right there are two really good reasons to get this toy. He is 7, and this is lots of fun for him to play with and be a ""spy"" especially after seeing Spykids. This is a good deal, especially for those who are scientifically inclined."
1,A compact version of Upgrading and Repairing PCs,"Upgrading and Repairing Laptops is just a version of Upgrading and Repairing PCs cut in half with about 50 pages on laptop related matters and a few grammar changes added to the book to make it sound laptop specific. Most of the information in the book has been copied out of Upgrading and Repairing PCs (some parts even sound as though you are meant to be using a desktop computer instead of a laptop computer). In some parts of the book there is hardly any talk of laptop computers. For the next edition of this book, the laptop-related parts of the book should be combined and the information that was copied from URPCs should be taken out. If you want to learn how your laptop works, get the service manual for your system and the current edition of URPCs."
2,Very Little Laptop Specific Information,"I bought this book hoping it would help with laptop diagnosis and disassembly. I was very disappointed. There is almost nothing laptop-specific in this book, and it does not cover some very common laptop problems. A lot of laptops I work on have video problems that are usually caused by a bad LCD screen, bad inverter, or bad motherboard. There is absolutely nothing in this book that helps diagnose which it could be, nor is there any info for disassembly of those parts. There is also very little info for major laptop disassembly.Overall, I would not recommend this book unless you are looking for an in-depth description of how various hardware components work. There is very little in this book that applies only to laptops, and there is very little diagnostic help with laptop-specific problems."
3,laptop repair,"I agree with an earlier reviewer. Many of the problems I've run into with laptops involve video components, such as the backlight, inverter, LCD screen, video chip issues, etc. They are just not covered in any real depth in this book, though I highly recommend Mueller's PC repair books. Morris Rosenthal's book on Laptop repair is better in the diagnostic and tshoot arenas and is just under 200 pages. Compact enough to carry in your backpack to repair sites. I've used it several times already and so far Morris hasn't steered me wrong."
1,Don't waste your money,"Modern word processor let people produce books quickly by copy-and-paste. As commented by an earlier reviewer, who gives one star for the book, this is a typical example. Amazon should allow the reviewer to give 0 star, which I think this book deserves.In my view, the main difficulty in reparing and upgrading a laptop is disasseble it. Once it is taking apart, nearly everyone with some experience in playing desktop computers would know what to do next. However, this book and the companion disk do a very poor job in this. It shows how to diassemble an IBM notebook, which is perhaps the easierest to disasseble. I hope to see the author to show at least one example from a few major vendors, such as Dell, HP, Toshiba, Sony, Acer. Unfortunately, it told us to get service manuals. If this is the advice, why this book is written?"
1,NOT A QUALITY INSTRUMENT,"I WAS TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE UNIT. THE SOUND QUALITY IS VERY POOR. I STRONGLY SUGGEST THAT AMAZON SHOULD NOT PROMOTE SUCH EQUIPMENT. I BUY A LOT FROM AMAZON BUT HOWEVER AMONG THE DOZEN I BOUGHT THROUGH LAST YEAR, THIS DOES NOT MEET THE STANDARD AS PROMULGATED BY AMAZON."
3,"Nice, but too big","This is a nice product but the foot print is too big. I suppose it's a perfect footprint for a bedside table if you're afraid of it tipping over but if you want to plant it in the kitchen, then it's a bit big"
2,The worst wig I own,"This wig is much brighter than the picture shown and the pigtails are not as full. The butterflies move around and do not stay on the top. The butterflies also tear the wig cap that the wig comes in. The wig did not even come in a box--it came in a plastic bag with a picture stapled on top, making the wig hard to store. I do not have a large head, yet the pigtails dug into my scalp and gave me a headache after a few hours. This is easily the worst wig I own."
4,Buy it Cheap,The material on this disk is very funny. Unfortunately it is only about an hour long. A good portion of this hour is taken up with other Python's reminiscing about Graham. Some of this is interesting & would be fine if the disk were longer. It looks like they even cut some of the skits purely for space issues. This seems ridiculous considering the DVD could easily hold more. (All the Personal Best series run this same length.)My advice is do not pay anywhere near full price for this. If you can get it for really cheap...go for it.
4,"""Apocalypse"" Is a Big Help","I've heard several different interpretations of the book of Revelation in the Bible, but this one breaks the book down into its respective chapters/verses. It's easy to get caught up in all the ""fear and dread"" that seems to come from many sources and it's great to read something that is more direct. The author doesn't claim to have complete understanding, but does clarify some of the mystical language and symbolism. This book will be a wonderful resource for our religious education classes."
3,What if the conspiracy theorists were right?,"All of them?That includes the death cult worshipping Princess Ann with human sacrifice - humanely, of course. It also includes the fanatical weather forecasters in search of the air dragons who make them look like such ninnies (not that they need much help). It also includes a secret government laboratory in the Australian desert, with Holt's usual assortment of marginal personalities and bizarre coincidences.It's good entertainment, in a wandering kind of way. Pratchett fans will appreciate the humor - but will be likely to appreciate Pratchett even more for the comparison.//wiredweird"
2,Not for me,"Recommended by friends who know my affection for Robert Rankin books I was expecting something similar, if a little less surreal. I was disappointed. Very put-able down-able, sporadically funny but not enough to make up for the lack of flow, I got the impression the author wrote this when he had nothing better to do. Maybe I picked the wrong book for my first Tom Holt, as were it more consistent in its humour, it would have been far more enjoyable."
5,Amazing Shave Cream,"If you shave with a razor, you have got to use this shave cream. I have used it for years now and cannot find it locally any longer. Hence, I am ordering it on Amazon. It works great especially for sensitive skin, very minimal smell(mostly the menthol), and lasts a long time. This is really the best on the market, and I have tried many others."
1,We the People,This publishing company needs to be investigated for its criminal activity. Please stop wasting our taxpayer dollars! Our schools need better informed authors to be in charge of textbooks.
1,This book should be banned.,"The book you should read that will explain why this book and school curriculum is undesirable is ""Textbook Review of WE the People: The Citizen and the Constitution"" by Allen Quist.You can get it here:[...]Why? It will show you that We the People is a blatant promoter of world government over our own national sovereignty. This is what is being pushed in our schools thanks to Goals 2000, NCLB, IB, etc. and is because the UN (UNESCO) has taken over control of our government and is now controlling the schools. If you cannot rid your schools of this treasonous postmodern nonsense, then you really should remove your children from them....The purpose of education today is to make the children conform to the totalitarian utopian world government under ONE authority, with no God given rights. This book is worse than leftist propaganda; it's one world government propaganda and promotes Marxism over freedom."
1,Lies for your children,"This book is a prime example of the pap Government Learning Centers are force-feeding our children. The Second Amendment is only cursorily included, in a section under Gun Control. Soon your kids will only be able to say ""You want fries with that?""Let's get this book pulled from the curriculum!"
2,incredibly small,"This sushi press is incredibly small and made from relatively inexpensive wood. Having said that, I was rather disappointed with the product considering the price (it looks bigger in the photo). Other than that, kudos to the seller for having it sent out promptly."
1,This thing stinks like rotten fish!,"I used this product a few times and it was a complete disaster. It was clumsy to use and not at all efficient in its task. My husband and I both love sushi, but after using this product, when we feel like eating sushi we go out to a restaurant. This was just a bad thing all around that I would not suggest to anyone, not even my worst enemy."
1,Transom Mount,Had this from the factory and it broke the sixth time out on rough water. I bought this as an extra seeing the factory could not get one to me for atleast three weeks. They covered it under warrenty but three weeks is a long time for the 797c2 SI. The reason they ran out is that they keep breaking on all the boats. Go with Amazon they had it to me in two days at a great price. Keep a spare for when you need it. Make sure it will flip up real easy so that there is a less chance of breaking.
5,Coffee Table or Serious Reading,"It's not just a coffee table book, though, if you're in the mood to flip through for fun when you can't find your reading glasses, it will certainly do- but it is a serious text about the why and who of this era or film- odd-ball details, quotes and special pages for the BIG stars (even Charlton Heston, who was a main crush of yours truly before I learned about his politics).This is the kind of book you can buy for a friend who loves movies or buy for yourself. Either way, leave it out when people come over. You will talk, laugh, and if you're old enough- remember that date who talked through Vanishing Point so you had to go see it again to savor Barry Newman without interference. Highly recommended."
1,The Stewardess is Flying the Plane!American Films of the 1970's.,"The Stewardess is Flying the Plane!American Films of the 1970's:Is a okay book,a quick glance at some picked movies,including some of my favorites: Dirty Harry,Corvette Summer, not really much for text except some info and the so-called ""counterculture"" of some movies(boring and typical). overall okay book and nothing you don't already know."
2,"Great pictures,lousy text.",The pictures are the main selling point here. Unfortunately the text is shaky . It offers a cursory study of the films of the decade and the writer appears to have used poor research methods as evidenced by a profile he offers on George Kennedy in which he mistakenly states that he played a sadistic prison guard in the 1967 COOL HAND LUKE. Kennedy actually won an oscar for that film and played a slow witted prisoner . The introductory interview with Peter Bogdonovich is also pointless as the director doesn't recall seeing many movies from the decade and shoots down the writer's thesis when he states that filmmakers of the period weren't any more a close knit community than directors of previous decades.
3,Not Thrilled,"I was disappointed to find that although the Delta Band Saw (#28-276) does fit loosely into the mobile base, the base is not designed to allow the saw to be bolted to it. The fact that the fit is not snug means the saw sometimes shifts its position when the unit is being moved, and I am concerned that it might also shift while being operated. One solution is to bolt a plywood platform to the saw base that is sized to fit snugly into the mobile base, thus preventing the saw from shifting. That is not a project I expected to have to take on when I ordered the base!"
5,Better that I expected.,I did not have high expectation and was pleasantly surprised. I installed under a very heavy 1946 Delta 14 inch and it is very stable.
3,50-941 mobile base,"As others have noted, this is not the right base for the 28-276 band saw even though it is listed as such. It is however cheaper. I drove a couple of slightly over sized wooden spacers in the front and it works fine. There is a little lateral space that I didn't fill since the tight front spacers seem adequate to prevent movement."
5,"Stone, Slow, Rugged","I have not heard most of these brilliant tracks since the seventies. The LP's are out of print and most folks outside of Texas have never heard of Rusty Weir. This CD brings it all back home. I was a teenage hard rocker when some friends cajoled me into going to a Dallas honky tonk called Whiskey River to see this genuine Texas troubador. After being exposed to the hard rocking ""Sally Mae"", the riff & twang of ""Aqua Dulce"", and the genre bending ""Black Hat Saloon"" I was hooked. The albums these tracks were culled from deserve to be heard by a new generation of country and/or rock fans. The songs fall comfortably in an acoustic setting and when the Fabulous Filler Brothers flat out wail. Whenever Wille & Waylon, Jerry Jeff or Michael Murphy are mentioned, Rusty Weir casts a giant shadow as a pioneer of the country/rock revolution of the mid seventies. And you know, it does make you wanna dance. Don't it?"
2,Iffy little player,"I have had this one for 2 years now. Problems began appearing slowly and then began to add up. First, it would stop playing certain DVD's. I'd have to power the player off and then on, and voila it would play it.Next, the component output blew out. I could only output on the composite. (I had not tried the HDMI then).Today, almost 2 years after I bought the player, I tried the HDMI. I get nothing - well, I get a snowy screen and some sudden promise of a magenta screen. Awfully sad to see.Stay away from this player. Its very temperamental."
3,GOOD STUFF,"This is a good box, and everyone can use it under any kind of enviroment. I like it very much. I hope you can buy one."
5,If you like rust on your metal then dont use this wheel.,This thing eats rust like a fat kid eats cake. Removing old paint from a car fender has never been so much fun. Awesome awesome tool!!!!!!
5,Outstanding!,"I've used a number of these type wire wheel attachments over the years. None has come close to being as effective and long lasting as this one. It's already seen hours of use, on very rusted jagged metal, and it still looks and performs like it just came out of the package. Strips rust as easy as a pencil eraser removes graphite. VERY impressive performance. Would gladly buy again (if I manage to wear this one out anyways)"
1,PURE REPETITIVE GARBAGE,"I purchased this EP ""I"" based on the reviews and ratings given by some of the followers of Meshuggah, but I should have listened to this 21 minute disaster first! What a waste of 21 minutes of my life for this repetitive garbage. There was maybe 3 minutes of the entire work that could have been considered listenable. I was very disappointed and wasted too much money on this!!!! I would suggest Skinless or Dying Fetus or maybe even Mnemic if you want some great metal."
4,Another great peice of work.,"Meshuggah delivers once again, Smashing the thunder down hard, very brutal, fast and raw, screaming in your face with brutal heavy guitars and hammering drums, The progression in sound is geting much more impressive with Meshuggah, this is back to the FAST impressive meshuggah then ""Nothing"" I will be looking forward to there new album, and im sure most fans will after hearing this. it dose kinda get boring quickly though, you love this you should check out ""Fredrik Thordendals Speical defects - Sol Niger Within 3.33"" if you havent."
1,can you say 'repetitive'?,"Wow, I swear, there are no more than 3 different riffs in the whole damn song each of them rambling on for about 7 minutes with a truly pathetic solo thrown in. Another phoned-in effort by the once almighty Meshuggah."
5,One of the Best Chew-Resistant Balls Ever!,"I wish that I had purchased two of these balls. Our dog demolishes Kong, JW and other brand dog toys in a sitting. This has been the only ball to hold up to her chewing. I love that the ball also doubles as a treat puzzle and fetch toy. Granted our dog manages to eat all of the kibble in under five minutes, but the dog peanut butter squeezed into the ball does entertain her for a longer time.I wish that the ball was a little bigger so that she wouldn't get the ball stuck under the couch so often, but that is my only complaint about the ball. I wish our local pet stores carried Planet Dog brand toys.My husband chided me for paying $10 for the ball, but I've spent more money on all of the other toys that she has mangled. This ball and her Nylabones are the only toys that have held up to her chewing, and that I feel comfortable leaving with her unsupervised in her crate. Believe me $10 is worth it for even 10 minutes of play without barking or counter surfing."
2,Fine... for about 3 weeks.,"With all the good reviews for this ball, I thought that it would at least last my crazy 40lb Shiba Inu-Shepard mix a month (Which seems to be the standard lifespan of a ball around this house). Things were going fine for about 2 weeks, until I noticed that the little hole going through the ball started to tear. After about another week, my dog was able to rip chucks from it.If your dog is known to have sharp teeth and a tireless jaw, I suggest you look elsewhere.So far this is the only ball that lasts a bit over a month:Chuckit! Ultra Ball Medium 2.5-inch, 2 pack"
2,Too small,Don't be fooled by the pictures this is as small as a tennis ball which is too small for a big dog.
3,RIP,After a few weeks of playing fetch strictly outside my 60-pound Pit Bull - literally - loved his ball to death this afternoon. :(It took about 15 minutes of concentrated squeezing and chewing before I started finding the pieces on the living room floor.
3,THE toughest!,"Orbee has the best and toughest toys for the strongest chewers! This ball withstands our German Shepherd Dogs chewing and chewing and chewing! They love the texture of the ball and the sound it makes when they chew it. This ball is by far the best we've ever bought.EDIT: This ball was good for a while, but after a few months of constant GSD jaws, it came apart at the ""seams."""
5,She loves it!!,"I have a dog that is a very active chewer, and she loves this ball!!! Plays with it everyday. Very durable since she has destroyed every toy she's had until now!"
3,Small,"Might be good for a small dog, but way too small for my black lab. Softer rubber not good for an aggressive chewer."
2,Ugly but a nice texture and soft enough for my puppy,The ball I got doesn't look like the picture but more like an ugly blob of plastic with a lot of molding ridges and wrinkles. For almost $12 a simple plastic ball should be more aesthetically pleasing. My dog could care less of course. For him the texture gives a good grip for his teeth and the ball is soft enough he can deform it. A red Kong ball is a lot harder. My puppy ripped the decoration off a two-color Orbee ball but this one is one piece and he does fine with it. A adult strong chewing dog would probably rip this ball up but it works ok for us.
1,NOT for extreme chewers!,"I bought this because I own an ""extreme chewer"". It said it would last as did many of the reviews. Well, my yellow lab had it in 1/2 inch pieces within a few hours. I would not recommend this if you have a dog that is known to shred store bought toys within minutes. So far, the only ""toy"" my dog can't destroy is the heavy duty laundry detergent bottles."
2,Not 'Tuff' enough for a young Irish Wolfhound!,"Well, the Planet Dog Orbee-Tuff Diamond Plate ball lasted a bit longer than some toys we've tried with our 11 month old Irish Wolfhound - about 2 hours of play before he was pulling off chunks! He did seem to really love the ball while it lasted, both chewing on it and batting it around the floor. He of course went for the weak point, the small opening, getting a canine tooth into the hole and then pushing away with his paws until the material ripped. Without the weak spot I suspect that the ball would have lasted quite a while, and been a oft played with toy. Perhaps the Orbee works well for chewers, but not so well for dogs who prefer to rip and tear at their toys. I will continue to search for something that better suits my dog's play habits!"
5,Alpaca poncho coat,"The poncho is beautiful and warm. It took a little longer to get here than I expected, but well worth the wait."
5,So warm and versatile,"I bought this for my 85 year old mother. She gets really cold - all the time - even in the summer. This is so soft and warm. Plus she can wear it over her head, on her shoulders, or over her lap! She loved it!"
5,Humminbird Transducer,This unit must have a hole drilled through the bottom of your boat. Make sure your boar does not have any brace or any type of re-enforcment in the area you are drilling. The unit makes it easy to keep the transducer level when you are installing. Use care in cutting the plastic block keep it very smooth and use a good type sealant both outside and inside of the boat. The unit works fine.
5,"Inventive, Catchy and Delightfully Unknown","Ever stumbled across a book or CD and loved it -- before the author or artist hit it big? That's the feeling I get from Bright Light Fever (BLF). When you buy this CD and crank it up, you'll wonder how these fellows aren't yet sipping martinis in a stretch hummer and touring with the Chili Peppers, REM or U2... And you can count yourself among the with-it group that recognized their talent early on. Check 'em out!"
3,has potential,"This book tries to tackle the ever difficult arabic verbs. It does an above average job however there are some holes. There are not too many examples on how to apply the verbs and how they affect the sentence. It does however touch on the past and present verb but that is rather simple anyways, but after that it gets complicated due to its lack of examples and fully explaing how the verb affects the sentence. For exmaple the shhada on the middle of the verb or the 'alif preceeding the verb. I would have found it much more benificial if it was much more indepth, arabic verbs need to be looked at carefully!"
4,I don't get it,"The people who trash this movie...I just don't understand it. I enjoyed it very, very much and I have this special edition version of the DVD. Got it for my birthday. Very fun packaging and the CD ROM is worth an afternoon of your time just for flipping through the pages of the comics. Only complaint about that is that I wish it was the old school comics and not the 1990s versions. Oh, well."
5,Used by marines in Iraq,"I haven't read this book, but saw it mentioned in an artical about Marines who stormed Falluja 11/2004. The officer there made his subordinates read it, among all else to underscore the need for troops to cover the armored vehicles while storming a city."
4,Definitely not Whedon's best,"Whedon made some of the best shows on TV; this is not one of them.This is still among the better things shown on TV nowadays. The premise is a bit sketchy (at least until we learn more about the Dollhouse's background), but there is a lot of fun to have here.So don't get your hopes up too high if you come from Whedon's earlier work; have a look at Buffy and Firefly if you only know Dollhouse."
3,"Great show, not so great packaging","The other reviews seem to focus on the show itself, this one is about the packaging.It's a regular sized bluray case, with the three discs crammed in there. Don't get me wrong, they're safe and sound, but still, I expected something extra sized for a whole season.There is no artwork inside whatsoever. Saved the discs, it's all white. The actual art on the discs could be better, but it's something.I also very much missed an episode guide, or at least a list. You buy the thing and if you don't go to wikipedia or something you won't even know how many episodes there are!The menu, however, is easy to use and pretty to look at, I like it a lot.As for the show, in my opinion, it's not as good as anything Whedon has done in the past, but still a very good show and I like it enough to have in on bluray.I also uploaded 4 pics of the case, check them out and you'll see how it looks inside and back."
1,Such a disappointment!,"I stayed with this series from the beginning and at first, I saw Joss Whedon's touch of genius. The plot was complex enough to be interesting and he has a way of balancing on the edge of good/evil. Then something went wrong.....it just seemed like he hated the dollhouse. I wont be a spoiler, but bringing issues like slavery and ""now, we have a black president"" killed this series for me. Very disappointing ending and then they brought the character I hated during the series right up to the front! There is little future for this series because it seems to hate itself. But I am still enough of a Joss Whedon fan to watch and all the actors deserve to work for a long time. They are all very talented, cant blame them..."
1,doll house,I did't like it at all. Especially the scene where a person could make love to his girl friend and then hunt her as an animal to b e hunted with his bow and arrows. ?Totally awful.
1,"None of these reviews are valid, not released yet","Amazons review system is a joke, set is not even out, They let people review products before released dates are even announced or even season is finished WTF AMAZON WTF. So when this item is available and I am able to take the time watch the DVDs and special features/extras I will write a valid and honest review not a paid advertisement like some of these other BOGUS reviews."
1,"Stupid, Stupid",This has to be the worse show I've seen in a long time. The actors are horrible and the writing just seems to drag on. Don't waste your time or money.
4,Great show!,"Although so far Firefly has been my favourite Joss Whedon work, this series has been excellent and left me wanting more at the end of the season! It gets better as you progress through the season, and I can see future seasons having ver intriguing and complex story lines. With all the crap that somehow manages to come back year after year, it is refreshing to see an intriguing, interesting show like this make it. Joss Whedon fans will be pleased with this - don't expect it to be his best, but of course there is the potential for greatness as we see the launch into season 2."
4,Episode 3 of Season 1 - Recommended,"""Stage Fright"" is the third episode of ""Dollhouse"" and it is a little weaker than the first two, but still entertaining. I strongly recommend you watch these in order since the back-story and plot lines build from episode to episode.No plot spoilers from me: The main story follows ""Echo"", who has been imprinted with a singer's profile to be a backup singer and undercover bodyguard for an edgy pop-star. FBI Agent Ballard continues to investigate the rumors that ""Dollhouse"" exists and we learn there are many secrets in the ""Dollhouse"".This was not the strongest episode, but it was watchable.Recommended!CFH"
5,A Steal,"At these prices, this under rated show is by all means a steal. Brilliantly plotted and coated in Joss Whedon's signature wit, Dollhouse is easily one of the greatest, and most unique shows to grace ever television networks anywhere. Hand in hand with an excellently casted ensemble with remarkable performances (especially in the second season), along with clever twists and turns at every point until your mind breaks. A bit of cautionary advice though, do not watch this show out of sequence."
5,Brilliant. Gone too soon.,"I'm so upset that this, another great Whedon show, is cancelled. I'm afraid he might just simply be light years ahead of his time. Brilliant show with a wonderful, multi-layer story line, fully fleshed out characters with a poetic analysis of the core of human consciousness.Love it. Gone too soon. More people should've supported it."
5,a very promisiing start,"As you can see, previous reviewers are somewhat torn as to their feelings for this series.I just finished the final episode recently and can only say that, although there were one or two lackluster episodes, the second half of the season was really starting to pick up steam.Whedon always takes us on a great ride and this series is no exception and whoever does his casting really outdoes themselves. The series is loaded with a great deal of Whedon (and BSG) favorites.If you haven't seen the series, do yourself a favor and buy it. I was in the same boat back when Firefly was released on DVD and I went ahead and bought the series after reading the reviews here on Amazon and I haven't regretted it for a moment (I now own the series on DVD, HDDVD (oops!) and Blu-Ray)."
5,One of the most exciting shows on television,"Wow! Okay, I found the pilot somewhat confusing - as though there was an episode missing. Then I watched episode two... I don't remember ever having felt so engaged in a story.I've read that Joss had to cowtow to Fox for the first 6 or so episodes before they gave him free reign - this might explain why people couldn't get into the series right away. I wish that networks would learn not to interfere with art.I hope this series goes on and on. It got picked up for a second season. Well done to Fox for not killing this like you did to Firefly and AD."
3,Dollhouse epitaph one,"Uh kinda got lost, To bounce like that and to be normal in season one and two... crazy... but very cool."
5,Joss Whedon's Genius,"This show is absolutely fantastic! Completely different yet equally as exciting, twisted, and thought provoking as Buffy."
4,Commercial breakpoints,Most of the comments are on the merits of the series or cost of the blu-ray.My comment is about the length of the commercial break points. That is the area where the commercials would be as it ran on US broadcast TV. The break points run a bit longer than any other TV series on blu-ray or DVD. Not sure why this is but is slightly annoying. Otherwise I would given this set a solid 5 star review. Fox did not encode Sons of Anarchy this way so I hope this is just a one time mistake.
4,pretty solid show,the title put me off but after watching the first show i was hooked. it's got good story lines and a good cast.
3,Watched 1 Episode,"I only watched one episode of the series. I chose that one because of the guest star (Brian Bloom). I don't want to spoil anything but I thought there was a lot missing from the way his character was portrayed. There were inconsistencies and the actual crime(s) he was supposed to be committing weren't clear. All in all I'd say the one episode was OK & I""m glad I watched it, but I probably won't watch any more of the series."
5,Another Quality Whedon Offering,"This is great. The original premise is good, but that wouldn't be enough to sustain interst for too long. Luckily there is more than enough of a story arc and unexpected twists and turns to more than sustain the show."
3,Good show but premium price,"Dollhouse is a good but not great show. It develops slowly and shakily to a two part climax that I really enjoyed. So whats wrong with it? It lacks star power and costs too damn much. Its only 13 episodes of an admittedly low rated bubble show. Why they believe they should charge $50 street for the BD is insulting. If it were reasonably priced it might be worth a second look, but as it is its an average show asking a hit price."
1,Wrong Season...,"I thought I had purchased the 2nd season since I already have the first, but I clicked on the wrong button. That being said, I never finished watching the 1st season, so I will do so and I will update my review....."
2,"Sorry, but no way this deserves all these 5 star reviews","Were these reviews all written by Joss and Eliza's relatives or something? It is the rare day that I turn on a TV show - especially one with a girl as hot as Eliza Dusku - and can't make it past the first 10 minutes. But this show was that bad. I tried to watch it again on a separate occassion and still couldn't do it. The acting and writing were horrible. I know I'm gonna get bashed by the Joss Whedon lovers but when I saw this had all 5 star reviews I had to add my two cents and try to save anyone on the fence about spending their money on this poor excuse for a show. And I don't think I'm the only one that feels this way, hence the fact that it may not be renewed. Two stars is a generous rating."
1,The First Joss Whedon Show that Deserved to be Canceled,"The first three episodes are unwatchable, an asexual sex fantasy starring maybe the worst actress working today. Long live Buffy and Firefly, two of the best shows ever aired, but this thing looks to be an abortion of digital media."
1,The worst thing Josh Whedon has ever made. Don't believe FAN BOYS,"I began to watch this show and I couldn't pass the 5 first episodes, It' is 0 interesting,0 exciting,,..... the horrible acting of Dushku and the boring and irrelevant plot make me quit. It's the worst thing Josh Wedon has ever made. Very mediocre. Reflects the bad situation of the curent TV networks. Very dissapointing."
5,It's a shame the show got canceled.,This is another awesome show that never made it passed season 2. Dollhouse could have been one of the best shows on Tv next to Fringe. It's hard to understand why Fox could cancel a good show like this but they can keep on stupid shows like glee and American Idol on the air. But Dollhouse is the awesome and you will have no regrets buy this on blu ray.
4,believe the hype and allow it time to grow on you,"start with the unaired original pilot. watch that then watch a couple of the episodes from the first half of the season before jumping straight to episode 6, noting how the chair changes. progress on from there to watch and appreciated Joss's master handiwork, including the also unaired ""epitaph one"". finish with concluding that fox once again screwed Joss over. sigh. and that joss should never second guess himself. sigh deeper. great show and I would give this set five stars if not for the first five episodes which drag and make you wonder what it is that you are watching and why. buy and enjoy."
4,Became something great,"Though it certainly had a slow start, this has become a great piece of television. After moving away from ""Echo mission of the week"" episodes and instead began to focus both on the ensemble cast and more seasonal story arcs, I became hooked.This show made me care about their characters, despite their amoral tendencies.Hope there's another season."
5,I will save this show or die trying!,"In a world (and on a network) where reality television is a power house, destroying ratings records (and our intellects), Joss Whedon's newest little invention ""Dollhouse"" comes along. It challenges our perceptions of free will, the soul, and feminism; telling an amazingly dramatic and action-filled story along the way. Anyone who is a fan of J. Whedon's other works (Buffy, Angel, Firefly/Serenity, Dr. Horrible) will find this show quite enjoyable. Unfortunately, it is in danger of being cancelled by FOX after only one short season. Dollhouse needs our help. Write e-mails to askfox@fox.com, blog, tweet to @foxbroadcasting, and pre-order Dollhouse season 1. Order several! Makes a great gift for any occasion."
5,Another Goodie from Joss,"Dollhouse was admittedly a bit slow to get started (as Firefly did as well), but it really got going a few eppisodes in! I have really come to enjoy the show. It's on at a problematic time (what where they thinking, putting it on Friday night when people tend to not be home!?!?), which I think has hurt its viewership. It is truly a show worth watching though, the premise is quite interesting and the actors are doing wonderful thinks with their characters. I look forward to more Dollhouse and hope that Fox gives it more time - they'd have exceled with Firefly if they'd given it more time and run it in order. Let's hope they don't make the same mistake twice."
3,Acceptable,"I enjoyed Dollhouse, and it gets a lot better in the second half of season 1, from episode 6 or so. However, it is in my opinion, unfortunately, far less than Buffy, Angel and Firefly was. I'm not sure what the problem is ... perhaps it's Eliza Dushku's acting. I like Boyd, Victor, Adelle, Ballard, Topher... don't care much for Echo, or Sierra for that matter.I hope season 2 turns out better and I'll keep on watching. It's a good show. It's just not as good as expectations vis a vis Joss Whedon."
4,Joss Wheadon is awesome!,I loved this series when it was on tv and am so sad that it didn't last for very long. Other than the condition it came in I am very happy that I own the Dollhouse season now. :)
5,The master does it again,"Joss Whedon does it again! Great cast, interesting plot twists. Always something new. I miss this show! It's a great show to sit down and watch on a rainy day!"
3,Buffy was better,"I gave this one a try because I'd seen Buffy the Vampire Slayer ( and generally liked it) and Angel (often liked it, especially in the early episodes) and liked Eliza Dushku in each of them. I was never as happy with this series- not liking the concept of people renting out their bodies to be ""imprinted"" with recorded memories/ personalities of other individuals to be used as desired. Ms. Dushku could perform quite a range of characters whether as a prostitute or agent on a mission-for me she was really the only reason to watch Dollhouse.That unaired pilot, I think they called it on the DVD, ""Echo"" obviously was rewritten for the second season finale, not much better here than there. In my opinion, if you're short on money look for 1st season in the bargain bin, and skip 2nd entirely."
5,Wow !,"I've never seen this serie before and I can tell that it is very intersting !Besides that the video and audio quality are awesome !And the best part, it has PT-BR subtitle !Good purchase !"
2,Not Whedon's finest.,"This series clearly did not live up the quality that was present in Buffy, Angel, or even the very short lived Firefly. Some of that blame goes to Eliza Dushku who cannot carry a show like Sarah Michelle Gellar. Whedon may have had an interesting idea, but the acting and execution was often mediocre at best."
4,"yes, it really is funny","A dopey, silly, funny movie, but perhaps not for everyone. Some elements of Woody Allen's Bananas, Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man, the Keystone Cops, etc., yet has its own dumb identity that should get a few laughs from you."
1,The Day The Mirth Stood Still...,"For the legions of Bob Dishy fans out there, this is for you. For the rest of us, IWWKHN is like drinking a battery acid cocktail- It's just not very funny! I kept hoping, praying for any shred of humor, only to be rewarded w/ tedium and Zzzzz..., Huh? Oh yeah, where was I? Anyway, this movie is NOT funny, unless you howl at reruns of Gilligan's Island. Oliver (Dishy) takes out a million dollar life insurance policy on his wife (Joanna Barns) in order to have her terminated so he can collect. Watching the execution of this set-up is much like swallowing a jagged brick! Slow and painful..."
3,Works!,Used as advertised! Will purchase again when needed! a little goes a long ways! though description does not fit the packaging
4,Zeasorb,I live in AZ where it is hot a good portion of the year. This powder works very well for the heat rash that happens around your bra band.
5,Awesome product!!!,"My daughter wouldn't hold her bottle, she hated having to tip it back! This was a huge problem as she would get super frustrated and I was holding bottles long past when I should be. My mom remembered these from when we were kids and thank God for the internet, you can't find them in stores! This gave my daughter much needed independence, she loves walking around with her bottle now!It worked with Dr. Brown bottles!"
4,Huge background knowledge,"Being a huge Star Wars fan, I recommend this to anyone interested in the movies. You really feel like being part of the making of process when reading this!"
3,Not as good as I hoped,"I was expecting something like ""Star Wars: The Magic of Myth"" for Attack of the Clones. It's nothing like that. There's no explination behind the story, mostly it just tells how the movie was made. There's tons of pictures but it is poorly organized and every page sings the praises of digital 'magic'. No depth to it at all."
5,Selected Shorts: Baseball (Selected Shorts series),This was absolutely wonderful! I have purchased several as gifts also and have heard rave reviews from all.
4,stepping stone kit review,"You need two parents to make these stepping stones,make sure their is lots of newspaper down, it is stone and will scratch countertops. My husband had to mix it, while I helped the kids put their hands in it, it was a lot of fun to do, and they make excellent presents for grandparents!"
3,Not impressed,I thought this would be the perfect father's day gift for my husband...the instructions are very vague and if you don't do everthing exactly right it doesn't work at all.
5,The Ultimate Buns!!!,"This workout is the best I've ever done to tone my lower body. That, along with Joanie's ""Vital, Visual and Vigorous"", I lost over 100lbs. in the past and had an incredibly toned body to boot! My stretch marks were the only sign to give away that I was a virtual tank! At 36, I had the body tone of a 20 year old! And here I am again at 45, and a virtual tank again! Sigh.Anyway, I'm back on the ball and losing it again, with Joanie leading the way! I'll always use these workouts because it has never failed me. In a year from now, I'll be back to my ol self again. These tapes are for serious exercisers, not those who don't want to feel any pain or put in any effort. Joanie don't play with you, she works you, period."
5,Perfect,I am really happy because the Visor cover my face and the sun can't make anymore black spots on my face anymore!!!The shipping was fast!
4,Clip on visor from Amazon,It took me a long time to find this clip on visor to replace the stained one that I have enjoyed wearing for years. I am happy to report that this visor met my high expectations for both comfort and coverage. I've only had the visor for a few weeks and am reserving the fifth star until I see how many years of wear I get out of it.
2,Tight,"This visor is very tight and gave me a headache when I wore it. I gave it to an 8-year-old neighbor and it fits her just fine. If you have a very small head this might work for you but if you have a lot of hair, try something else."
1,Couldn't Even Watch...,"I like cheesey horror. But this film was nothing more than soft-core porn. If you want to watch porno, why not watch the real thing? Disappointing on all levels. 1 Star."
2,missed an oportunity,"I had anticipated the arrival of this movie, even recognizing a much over done plot senario. While there were a couple of new wrinkles in this movie, they of themselves could not save the day. If there was ever a movie that cried out for an unrated version, this would be it. That would have at least classified it as a soft-core release, and perhaps satisfied some in that respect. After all there are some degenerate souls out there that enjoy lesbian vampire movies. We know who we are, don't we? Hee! Hee! However, you have to get beyond bra, and panties to be soft-core. Further, to be a vampire flick there has to be some neck munching, which in this case was only implied, except one instance occuring very late in the movie, and didn't really seem to have much to do with the main plot. As with the ending, I can't ruin the suspense for anyone, because I'm not even sure whether good, or evil prevaled. Better rent it, if you can find it."
2,Waste,"Vampires, hot sorority girls, ""B""movie....It didn't sound all that bad to me since I am a vampire and 'b' movie lover.I was mislead. This flick was terrible, a waste of time, money, and energy.The acting was choppy and bad, the filming wasnt too bad, but the settings were that of low budget porn, and the story - while mildly interesting at first - ended up terrible as well. The chicks were decent looking, but even for guys looking for a hot chick on chick thrill, it is not worth it.I saw a preview for this somewhere and it looked really good for a low budget film.Don't be fooled."
4,I love this video. Good job to Lito Tejada. Fellicidades.,"This is the first ski video I ever bought. I liked this video so much that I decided to get the 'BreakThrough On Skis I' as well. I consider myself an intermediate skier. I am fairly good when no bumps and powder are around, although I'm helpless when I have to face bumps and when the slopes start turning challenging. I took a real life lesson on bumps and the instructor was completely worthless. Lito teaches you different levels of bump skiing and tricks to face them. Starting up on smaller ones and moving gradually on to more difficult and challenging ones. With Lito's video you can get a very clear idea of what bumps to attack first, rather than jumping straight into real challenging ones. Now I have a very clear idea of what to do when I have to face this challenging terrain."
4,good machine; wobbly wheels,"i purchased this grinder primarily to sharpen lathe tools. it is a good grinder but both wheels have a bad side to side wobble. i emailed delta about this and they replied that the wobble was normal and that i should dress the wheels to true them up. i have no problem dressing the grinding faces, but am reluctant to start cutting down the sides. if this machine came with better wheels it would be a 5. fast delivery from amazon as usual."
3,thartford,"I also own a Delta 23-725 which is a much better machine, but this one isn't all bad. I use this one for grinding, and the more powerful 23-725 for wire brushes. As mentioned in anther review, the stone quality is poor, they have to be trued up. The 23-725 probably won't come with any better stones, but it is a much better machine. The variable speed on the GR450 really serves no purpose, and no grinder should turn over 1800 RPM. In my humble opinion the GR450 is a 6"" machine with 8"" wheels stuck on it. It you don't need a lot of power, and you have some strange need for the variable speed go for it; if you want a great grinder get the 23-725. I should also mention I've had my 23-725 for six years; if they've changed it I wouldn't know about that."
2,High vibration,"Vibrates at the low speed setting - both wheels wobble excessively - probably due to wheel unbalance. When the speed is increased, the rotational frequency at one speed excites one of the natural lateral modes (frequencies) of the eye shield causing it to vibrate approximately 3/4 inch which introduces a clicking sound. Tried to improve the balance by rotating the collar that secures the wheel - with no success. I will be returning the device within the next few days. I am not yet sure whether I will request a refund or request another grinder. I like the variable feature the Delta grinder offers. I might also select the six in grinder. The smaller wheels might mitigate any unbalance and vibration."
4,"Not a Baldor, but does the job","I loved the way it is so easy to replace wheels on this. A really good design there. But the wheel mounting is another thing. The inside wheel holder disc just does not hold the wheel true. My wheels wobbled almost 1/4"". Not much can be done about it. Perhaps if these discs were machined instead of stamped, they would work better, but the way they ride on a shoulder on the shaft is scary.I checked the runout on the spindle, and it was fine. Speed control was nice & smooth.One year later -I eventually bought a wheel balancer, and I do have to say that the unit has been otherwise reliable.Two years later -still working fine, and my complaint about the design is one that applies to just about all the grinders in this class. They all wobble a bit too much for fine sharpening."
1,Dr. Wiygul,"My Delta power switch started going out within 90 days of purchase. I called the phone number with the warranty papers. Had to wait until it quit working entirely as it was a sporadic problem. Now, 180 days later, it does not work at all;DELTA GR450 ShopMaster 8-Inch GrinderI hate it. I am tossing it in the trash. I am not going to send it back. I want a better bench grider all together."
2,Noisey and unbalanced,I did not purchase this grinder from Amazon but wanted to add my opinion. I agree with the person below. The grinder growls loudly when the speed is adjusted to low and there is also an unusual amount of vibration. My old $35 imported grinder is smoother and quieter than this grinder. Not recommended. UPDATE: After just one week of use this grinder started smoking and cutting out.
1,"Shake, rattle, & roll","I can't believe that Delta is still selling this grinder!!! Unless they've made improvements, DON'T buy this grinder. The arbor doesn't have deep enough of a shoulder to support the inside wheel flange perpendicular to the arbor, so you end up with grinding wheels that wobble so badly that it will blow the light bulb and rattle it loose from its socket in short order. There's nothing that you can do to make this grinder run anywhere near ""smoothly"".After two years, I gave up on this grinder and purchased a slow speed grinder from a popular wood craft company that ran MUCH smoother right out of the box. After a few more minutes tuning, it's running much smoother than I ever dreamed of getting the GR450 to run."
3,Workmanship,"When I tried to remove the grinding wheel from the motor shaft, I found out that it was stuck. Evendently the shaft had wet paint on it when the wheel was put on. In removing the wheel it was bound up so tight that I had to force it off resulting in it flying off onto the floor and breaking. I had to spend another $30.00 to get a new wheel."
5,Grinder Review - GR450,"I bought this grinder despite the poor reviews that it got here. I haven't had problems with either noise or vibration on any of the speeds (this includes using it without it even being bolted down). I haven't done any real heavy grinding on it yet, but have sharpened some chisels."
3,Variable speed a minus?,"OK, I own the twin to this unit, a Steel City grinder without the quick change feature, but what I find is that it is difficult to balance the wheels for different speeds. Yes, I can balance them nicely for slow speeds, but then they spin with a different harmonic at high speeds. And when the wheels are not balanced, the light bulbs blow out immediately. I gave up on the light. As with most grinders, the tool rests are virtually useless. Try setting these up to grind a proper angle on a chisel. I'll rework these or make my own. I'd like to hear from others on the quality of wheels these days. These Chinese jewels that came with the unit were out of round and out of true every which way. Are Nortons better?"
1,too much vibration and noise,"This grinder shakes so bad it breaks the light bulbs in the lamp. It lacks power and is extremely noisy, even without the wheels on it still growls so loud you can hardly hear anything else. I wouldn't recommend this grinder to anyone."
3,Wheel wobbles excessively,"I got this grinder about a month ago. I've been fighting vibrations and wheel run-out problems ever since. I think I have it narrowed down to the inner flanges which are some very low quality stamped washers. The parts breakdown lists the same part number for both the outer and inner flanges. But the outer flange is a nice, machined piece of steel which is about 1/4-5/16"" thick while the inner is this stamped peice of sheet metal....I think the problem is in that flange. Contacting Delta support has been impossible so far....will keep trying."
3,Delta GR450 ShopMaster 8D Grinder,"No problem to set up, but it tends to vibrate a bit, either because the wheels are not balanced well or because they're out of round. Trying to solve the problem by using the diamond wheel dresser meets with limited success."
1,I got a LEMON,I got this grinder at Lowe's because they were cheaper. I only got it because of the lower speed to sharpen lathe tools . It ran fine for about 10 min. on the slower speed then suddenly it started running at top speed. The speed control had no effect on it. I felt of the motor and it was so hot you couldn't leave your hand on it. I turned it off and waited till it cooled down and turned it back on. It only had the top speed . So I guess I just got a Lemon. I returned it to Lowes for a refund. Good luck if you buy this model.
1,Quality Concern,"The packaging was good as the box was unpacked. From there, it progressively got worse. The brackets to hold the clear shields on do not offer adequate fit. The bracket to hold the tool rest is finished for a left hand application. Once again fit & finish is not a concern at Delta. When I turned the machine on, It almost vibrated off the bench. I turned the variable speed up to see if it would make a difference and in doing so, it stayed on full throttle. The knob is totally inoperable and does nothing. The Wheels could not be trued using the supplied stone dresser. Looks like they will have to be replaced with better quality. Delta support line is closed tonight. Hopefully they will support this mess of a machine!!"
1,Absolute Junk,"I recently purchased this product with the expectation that it would perform basic tasks in an acceptable manner given that its price was well-below high-end grinders such as the Baldor.It failed miserably.After running for less than 5 minutes, the machine began to make a very loud chattering noise ... like a bad bearing. Turning it off and then on again the noise ceased, came back and then it started to smoke! The motor housing was extremely hot. After at least an hour, it was still too hot to touch. Needless to say, I returned it.I own several Delta power tools: X5 jointer, drill press, mortising machine, planer, hybrid table saw and am relatively happy, although I'm trading up to a SawStop and wouldn't consider a Delta bandsaw.This grinder should be avoided ... it deserves zero stars."
5,A Classic!,This is an accurate version of the story of the bible that never grows old! Highly recommended for all ages.
3,The Power of Words,"This book is interesting, but not compelling. It illustrates Lincoln's use of the printed word to influence the tide of history, but is not told in a compelling manner. The reader will have to dig for its importance."
4,good print,I put this in my sons room and picked up a black metal frame elsewhere and it looks great. Son is a big Giants fan so he liked it.
5,This CD Rocks!,"This CD sounds like Tesla or Skid Row. Great production, tight performances, several veteran artists, Fred Coury [Cinderella] really stands out."
5,BEST MALE VOCALIST IN ROCK...BAR NONE!!!!!!!!,"WHY HASN'T THIS BAND, ESPECIALLY THIS SINGER BECOME A HOUSEHOLD NAME, JEEZ, WHO IS BETTER???? THE WINNERS OF AMERICAN IDOL AREN'T FIT TO CARRY THIS GUYS JOCKSTRAP!!!!!!"
4,BUBBLEGUM POP AT ITS BEST,"Shampoo did not deserve to be forgotten. Unabashedly pop music, the girls revelled in the glamour of pop/rock n' roll, and made music that trounces anything by the boy bands, or the teen queens. It's Spice Girls meets the Sex Pistols, pop done with punk aggression and abandon. Prime Cuts: ""Delicious,"" the most infectious song in decades, ""Girl Trouble,"" and ""Shampoo You."" Buy it!"
4,voices from the Edge: Narratives about the Americans with Disabilities Act,I did not give five stars because I was mainly interested in researching on the discrimination by disability information and what methods of arguments I could use in making my lawsuit case.The book was good in showing how far the American Disabilities Act would go in applying to various cases of discrimination that can be claimed. I will use it as a reference book for further investigations of the ADA law.
5,The Standard in Basic Electronics,"I have read this textbook many times over the years, by that I mean various editions. I always come back to it when I want to refresh my memory on electronic fundamentals. It was the first electronic text I was introduced to in 1965 at a technical institute in Indiana and it is used for a fundamentals course in an engineering school I am enrolled in now, what does that tell you about Grobs work. I recommend it highly."
5,Awesome as Always,"After listening to Collin Raye's Fearless CD I can certainly understand why his career has endured so long. Whether he's doing an original song or a remake he does it with style and sincerity. Every original song on this CD is standout Collin. The remakes, My Way (which was definitely done his way - and very well!!!) and The House of the Rising Sun (not one of my most favorite songs when it was originally released) are both creditable versions of the originals. I am anxiously looking forward to his next release."
3,THROW AWAYS,"Fearless by Collin Raye is not as good as any of his other CDs(except Counting Sheep which is awful) and I have them all. It seems like most of these songs are throw aways. Cover songs like My Way and House Of The Rising Sun don't reflect the image of Collin as it should be reflected. As always, his voice is excellent, but the songs aren't as good as they should be for an album of his. It's part of my collection but it won't get played much. Walls Came Down is his best CD ever."
1,poor quality,Bought this product for my job at a body shop. Saw broke right out of the box. Drive piston snapped. Returned the saw for replacement and received another. Second saw worked for half a day and then the same result. Wouldn't recommend this product even for light duty.
4,not as easy to set up.,"the instructions claim it will only take 20 mins to install. It took about 45 mins and a hammer, but it is still a great product."
1,This is a travesty,"Any fan of Goldorak (the French and Canadian title of the show) trying to satisfy their nostalgia with this terrible, terrlible American dub will be horrified to see what has been done to it. I don't know where to begin. Perhaps with the opening theme, which, undoubtedly due to the inexcplicable laziness and apathy of its localizers, is almost silent. The names of the character's are laughable. You would think you were watching a bad Fox sitcom. The original story has been rendered meaningless and soulless by the American actors (or their voice director). I seriously recommend that any fan of the series who has fond memories of the show it in any of its other forms (Japanese, French, Italian) stay far away from this abomination. The only way I can watch this thing is with the mute button turned on."
4,"Fun, but hard to see screen","I just want to say, that I agree with a couple of the other reviews. The lighting on this game is really bad. You can hardly see the screen! It would be more fun if they would make the screen easier to read. Otherwise, the game is great!"
1,Wasted my money on this handheld game,"The screen graphics and the speed on this handheld toy are extrememly poor. I have never had problems with other handheld games before, so was very disappointed when I received it. In my opinion, a game should be fun and easy to use. This was totally frustrating with no entertainment value."
3,"Not AOL Slingo, but a Good Substitute","Grapics leave a lot to be desired, the game goes too slowly (especially after you've gotten a devil), and has numerous scoring errors. However, is entertaining when AOL Slingo isn't an option."
3,YOU BEST WEAR YOUR GLASSES FOR THIS GAME! ! ! ! !,THE SPIN NUMBERS IN THIS GAME ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE EVEN IF YOU'RE WEARING EYEGLASSES.
3,Playing Blind,I enjoy Slingo in the internet and purchased the hand held game for my mom. I was very disappointed with the display of the game. The numbers are very hard to read and by the time you make them out the fun is gone. Since this was my moms first experience with the game she wasn't willling to put up with the dim lighting. I had to give the game away. Can not believe other people do not find this a problem.
3,Slingo is OK,"Some good mindless fun. The screen is very dim and hard to read, however. One other flaw is that the unit takes too long to reset itself between the end of one game and beginning a new one. An OK value for the money."
3,Slingo Hand Held Game,"It is fun, if you are a Slingo On-Line Fan. We were just really disappointed in the graphic quality though, it is very hard to see, especially the bottom numbers in each column that you have to match up. It is fun playing it, but after playing the hand-held game, the next time you can play it on-line, you're thankful because you can see it so much better! I personally would not recommend it for the price."
1,Slingo Handheld Disappointing,This game was very small and extremely hard on the eyes. Graphics are very poor. Stick to the online version!!
4,Very Handy Book,I like this book. Bought it last year and this year actually started reading through it and made two necklaces. This is a great book for beginners and a nice book for those of us that have beading experience and just want to learn new techniques.
1,Don't throw your money away on this product,"The activation process for this product ties hardware configuration to the serial number. Then if you upgrade your hardware, you can not re-install this product on a new configuration (even after uninstalling from older hardware). Then try to get a hold of Scansoft, $19.95/phone call and $9.95/e-mail. Poor product performance and poor product support."
1,This product is HORRIBLE!! Don't Buy It!!,"I tried using this product on some PDFs and it just would NOT convert them properly! I called tech support and they said sometimes it doesn't work too well why don't you buy our more expensive Omnipage product. They would not return my product nor give me free tech support with this product. After charging me $20.00 per incident on tech support they were unable to resolve my problem. They just said well ""It does not work sometimes, buy our Omnipage product instead"". Horrible customer service over there. ScanSoft truly exemplifies poor customer service."
1,Worse than useless,"I bought this based on a Scansoft e-mail ad that made wonderful claims for the accuracy of the PDF to Word conversion capability. Boy was I disappointed! I have yet to see the first accurate conversion of anything more complicated than a simple non-letterhead typed page. I tried to use it to update a manual of about 70 pages and found that it took over twice as long to fix the mess that Scansoft PDF Converter made, than it did to completely re-publish the manual grahics and all. If this product was free it would be a poor bargain."
1,Look at the quality- or the lack of it!!,"Yes, it does provide a cheap alternative to Adobe, but the quality is much cheaper than the price. The words look blurred as if the ink had spilled. Do not expect to show your work to anyone else cos people will make fun of you for such sorry looks. Just a waste of time and money!!!"
1,Something is really wrong in America today,"I am not sure which is more disturbing.1.) The fact that you people rave over this guy. Didn't he make jokes about the beheadings in Iraq? What kind of sick and twisted cretin would make jokes about something so terrible?2.) That this guy is friends with Michael Moore, and together the two of them are poisoning the minds of millions with their hatred and contempt for Americans."
5,Hilarious,"Very funny (and at times challenging) stand up comedy. Riffing on politics and social commentary, Maher manages to step on toes and tip the sacred cows of the self righteous on both the right and the left. Recommended for any thinking American."
4,It's all about the slogan that mesmerizes the stupid masses!,"My favorite comedian as always says it as it is. The double standard of our culture propagates empty slogans but never puts them to action, publicly puts the men down and tries to boost women's ego, even when we all know how horribly women are treated in work places. In short, Maher is striping naked the lies and showing the truth as it is.This man has a beautiful mind, so enjoy the laughter while thinking: are married people happy? Do we really support our troops? Do we really respect our politicians? Do you really understand the real reasons behind the wars we are involved in???It's kind of about time that we start questioning what we are told."
5,VERY funny,I saw this on HBO and had to buy the DVD. This was a hit with everyone in my family - Dems and Republicans alike.
5,Funniest social commentary I've seen,"I had never watched his cable show, and never understood all the fuss about Bill Maher, but, now I do! Maher is an astute, and exceedingly witty social commentator. Glad I borrowed this DVD from a friend. I'm going to buy my own copy now."
4,"Decent seller, awesome DVD","I gave negative feedback to the seller (Movies, Cds Games & More)because the Blue Ray disc would not play in any of my devices. However, the DVD played beautifully which was the reason I did not return the item. This show is excellent and as many reviewers suggest this is exactly what making music is about. I highly regard vendors that take responsibility for their products and make the effort to keep customers happy. I have just received a phone call from Shawn at Movies, CDs Games & More who's offered me a $10 refund for the unfortunate Blue ray disc, which I thought it was only fair. He mentioned that given my experience and that of a couple of other customers, they have decided to remove the product from Amazon, a fair move as well."
5,He loves Radiohead!,This was a gift for my nephew who loves Radiohead. He was so excited to get this so I'd recommend this for other Radiohead fans.
1,Too many issues on too many BluRay players in the US,"The BluRay will simply do not run on any PS3 in the US, as well as a lot of BluRay players (in fact, all the players i could access to). Why? I quote an email i received from W.A.S.T.E. (the company behind the BluRay): ""The Blu-Ray video was encoded at 25fps and remained this way as converting to 30fps drastically reduced the visual quality. This does mean however that some US region locked players may experience play back issues due to the standard setting of 60fps in the States.""But obviously this is a classic problem when editing videos, it only shows that this company has no experience or whatsoever when they target the international market. They just hide behind the ""quality excuse"" to justify a mistake they made.W.A.S.T.E. has a name that fits them well: a big waste on time and money..."
4,A Funny ... Movie,"Not like we were expecting the best acting job, but I was lovin this movie. The plot line is hella funny and the characters are cool. The music is on point and fits in perfectly with the plot. It's a bit cheezy at points, but seeing some of your favorite rappers in a tight ... little movie is coo. A nice pick up for Lynch fans."
2,sucks,I love brotha lynch but this dvd is horrible. It just has some bad acting and it's really about nothing
1,Disappointment,Definately a total letdown. Everything from the filming to the plot to the horrible acting. Now I know these cat's are rappers and not actors but you gotta put some effort into a movie if your going to make one. I just feel that Lynch should stick to the baby-killin rappin style for now. Peace
2,Expensive,"I felt this kit was expensive for the small amount of items that came with it. It is cute and beats having my kids sit in front of the television, [...] As a plus I must admit that my children (ages 9 and 7) enjoyed painting the butterflies and turning them into magnets. That is worth a few stars."
4,I LOVE BUTTERFLIES!,"AS AN ADMIRER OF BUTTERFLIES, I KNEW I HAD TO BUY THIS KIT FOR MY ALMOST 15 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER. AND MY PLAN WORKED PERFECTLY!!! I NOW HAVE THREE BEAUTIFUL BUTTERFLY MAGNETS THAT I RECEIVED THIS PAST MOTHERS DAY ON THE FRONT OF THE REFRIGERATOR."
3,TOO EXPENSIVE FOR CASUAL USE,"I bought 3 sets (9 butterflies) as a project for my kids' group. Maybe the kids were too hyper that day, but they tore through the butterflies ($50 worth) in about 5 minutes, and the results of this frenzy were not particularly pretty. The results were much better when the kids painted ""stained glass"" butterflies that I got at Walmart for less than a dollar per butterfly. The wooden butterflies have great potential, but I would recommend them only for an older artistic child who is willing to spend the time to do a good job. On the other hand, the 5-7 year old kids wanted to take their sloppy wooden butterfly magnets home to Mom; the older kids abandoned theirs (knowing they hadn't done a good job)."
2,Not my kind of BBQ!,"I had never tried dehydrated food before (except Astronaut ice cream, hehe) so I was curious to try this.I bought this flavor because I am a big BBQ fan.I got the package and opened it right way, I was surprised at how powdery it was but I wasn't bothered because I thought it would thicken up when it was done.I followed instructions and let it sit for 15 minutes (it looked a lot better at this point), it was still very thin like soup so I let it sit for another 10 minutes hoping it would thicken up some more, then I had to serve it up in bowls with spoons.I took one bite and was totally overwhelmed with the taste of liquid smoke! that was all I could taste it was way too powerful! and the chicken pieces were hard and difficult to chew.I couldn't eat anymore but my brother finished his bowl with the help of crackers, although, he said he wouldn't eat it again.I will try a different flavor from Alpine before I throw in the towel though."
4,Walser is good,"Walser is a very talented but very under-rated writer. Walser refuses to dominate the story. He lets his characters do that. He slowly builds the story and the characters. And he narrates the story in such a tremendous way that I felt that I was in that school myself. BTW, this book is about a young man's experience in a servant school where his spirit refuses to be supressed by rules and attitudes of people around him. There are not many twists in the story. This book is character driven with a statement and not plot driven. I loved it."
5,indeed,Any true lover of literature will love Walser. The only complaint that can possibly be made is the poor paper quality of this edition of this book. The publisher should re-print.
5,Perfect for those hard reach areas,This is the right length for the middle of the back. Many people asked me where I purchased it.
1,Absolutely horrible... Stay away from this product!!!,"So I purchased this product in my tanning salon for maybe 10 bucks. After 2 or 3 applications, the sponge just came off the handle, likely because they're using some sort of silicon glue that doesn't handle moisture. The salon manager replaced for me in total 5 applicators, until he got fed up with it and decided to not carry this junk anymore. I usually don't leave product reviews, but as I was shopping for some replacement, for a more sturdy applicator, I stumbled upon this one, and I wanted to share my horrible experience with it. It does the job, but only for 2-3 times, so that makes each application 3 bucks a pop."
5,Superior Book!,"In this book Carol Hacker has given the job hunter a powerful tool - true knowledge. Unlike many dense books on job search, she made the book easy to read and to understand. It's very much like sitting down over a cup of coffee with a senior executive and finding out what's REALLY going on. Whether you are an experienced executive or entry level newcomer, there is a lot you don't really know about job hunting and won't until you read this superb book!"
1,Worthles piece of plastic,"Although this is an ingenious idea, this particular device is worthless. The ""lighter"" tip is too long and narrow and does not fit snugly in the socket as it should. I've tried three (3) different sockets and it was very loose in all of them. Twisting the nut has no effect. I would give this 0 stars if I could"
5,Excellent Reference Book,"This is a great book, and is well written. It has lots of details - leaves little to guessing - and shows some awesome techniques. The book also has strength training drills for wrists and upper body as well as drills to increase accuracy. The book includes a traditional form and the breakdown for the individual techniques in it. Also, at the end of the book, there is a lenghty section covering sparring drills between staff, spear, stick, sword, chain whip, and sword/shield. Excellent reference book, well worth the investment. I also recommend the accompanying DVD; you may have to look around to find it, but it helps the form make sense."
5,Tailgat handle,Worked great. Probably a 10 minute install including cleaning the lock and latch parts (as long as I was in there).
4,F350 Tailgate Handle,"Part was just like OEM item and installed easily. Only reason it didn't get a full 5 stars is because it was not beefed up from OEM, the stock one broke this one will probably break again down the road, but it is every bit as good as Ford Stock item."
4,Will due!!!!,"Not the most sturdy tailgate handle on the market, but for the price, you can't beat it. Hopefully it will last a while."
1,"Not the ""greatest religion novel of our time""","I was disappointed in the theme of this novel, although everything else about it is in the highest category of skill by the author. Of course, it's an older production, and I'm reading it today, not way back when it was written/published. I prefer his other works (the UFO Projeck, etc)"
5,Excellent Reloading Manual,"This is a very good manual that explains all the basics, and much extra, of reloading. All subjects related to reloading are covered. It is partly a compilation of articles which have appeared over the years in the NRA monthly magazine. These articles are very detailed, and written by experts. The book includes load data for all the well-known cartridges, including cartridge and chamber dimensions. Also included are factory ballistics tables from Federal, Winchester and Remington."
4,Great trimmer/cutter but discontinued!,"I have this trimmer/cutter and it's been really great but I can't get the replacement blades or rubber mats because Westcott has discontinued it and is no longer supplying the replacement parts. I'm very disappointed in them - I didn't purchase it to be a disposable, I liked that you could replace the blades and other parts. Evidently not, tho."
4,Great trimmer,Great trimmer. Finally found the rotary blades on Amazon. Not sure why they are so hard to find but they were. Westcott needs to make a replacement rubber piece where the blade wears into. Cant find that part for this trimmer!
5,Great,This was for my son and it met his wildest expectations!! He limits himself to one episode per day!! Thanks!!
3,Ford Ranger Tailgate Handle,"I guess I was a little surprised when I found out that the tailgate lift handle is plastic, but indeed it is. The replacement handle was identical to the old one and fit perfectly into place with no issues. It took only about 15 mintues to switch it out. The disappointment with this product is that you only get the product. No instructions and no assistance, which would have been nice. Luckily I had already found a very good video on You Tube and had it figured out. You don't need to be a mechanic to switch this one out. On a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being most easy and 10 being most hard, this one is truly a 1. Other than that, the product is fine."
2,2004 XLT Replacement,"This was a replacement for my 2004 Ranger XLT. It fits just fine, but the bolt cover came from a less than perfect mold. I went with the stock bolt cover as it fit better. Remember to clean the mechanism and lube it with white grease before installing the new one!Add 4/16/12This item has ALREADY broken."
2,tailgate handle,"this is the second tailgate handle I have bought, the original handle finally broke on my 1999 Ford Ranger so I bought this one, and it broke two months later I hope this last one I bought last longer. every thing is plastic and cracks easy"
3,Uche Kalu for president!,"While the book was moderately interesting, the author was very intriguing. This is an excellent tale that makes you remember things that happened to you in the past while you were growing up in the past, you know, like back in the day. I enjoyed learning about African culture, and the book was very informative in regards to the life of young males in Africa. But Uche Kalu should run for president in 2004. I think he would be an ideal candidate for the Green party. Peace out!"
4,I never used to like reading!,"I never used to like reading but since i picked up a copy of ""The Moon At Noon"" my whole world has changed! This book has the ability to send you to a time and place very different from here and now, but also quite similar to what you are used to as far as everyday life goes. This book was a welcome travel companion on my last trip to the Ukraine. Both my significant other and I highly recommend this book to anyone who has a deep thirst for knowledge. I only wish i could download it into my Visor so i would always have it with me!"
4,The reflection of African colonial experience,"The Moon at Noon is simply a reflection and the narration of colonial activities in the early years in Africa. The most interesting part of the book is the life of the little, boy,chike.He was traditionally and culturally raised by his mother.However,all the training he derived from his mother was turned upside down when the coloniests took over the land, and brought a new culture to the people."
4,Super Novel,"After reading the Moon at Noon, I was delighted the way Mr. Kalu wrote the book. He told the story everyone is aware of in a simple style, which makes it easy for anyone to understand. I love the way he presents this true story with fictional characters that makes it looks like the characters did witness the colonial events in Africa. Bravo, Mr. Kalu. That was a very excellent creative work."
3,"Cool concept, But not so durable!","My sons loved this outfit. However, the all plastic backpack isn't well constructed, and has a bad 'plastic' smell to it that didn't go away even after weeks of being out of the bag. There was something sticky and gooey on the upper part I could not wash off.The cloth 'jumpsuit' and top were ok, typical, thin costume quality, and got snags and tears after about a month. However they wore the costume for play time, not just one night for 'Halloween'.I was really dissappointed in the plastic attached backpack. I would rather have purchased one of the space shuttle 'jumpsuits' that look better constructed, than this, if I had it to do over."
4,good value,"Quick shipping, a bit palsticy and a bit of work to blow up the back-pack portion. But the price for all the accessories was great. A small fit our 5 yr old. very fun costume."
1,This is Terrrible!,We opened this costume 24 hours ago...and it is already broken. The inflatable airtank's straps tore off and left a hole (no so inflatable any longer). The mask doesn't attach to the tank propoerly. The materials are incredibly cheap.DO NOT BUY THIS!
4,foundation of yoga demystified,"I do Hath Yoga ( physical exercise ) but never tried to bother on the why and the real essence of Yoga. This books gives a clear foundation on why Yoga apart from health benefits - is in actual to control mind - which in turn will give glimpses into the no-thoughts movements. Also accompanied by nice interesting stories to help the message become more cheerful to understand - like in every Osho book. But the best of Yoga of relationship isLove, Freedom, Aloneness: The Koan of Relationships"
2,Somewhat disappointing,"Customer equity is clearly the name of the game and a hot topic in the business world right now, but I was hoping for a more up-to-date treatment. This book offers some fairly useful, but comparatively well-known and mundane, material about managing customer acquisition and retention, but the content advances little beyond Blattberg's mid-1990s Harvard Business Review article. I suspect that the third author (Thomas) may have done much (all?) of the writing, because the other two are heavily occupied by their consulting practices. There is some really cutting edge work going on right now in the customer equity/customer lifetime value arena, but this book does not reflect most of it."
4,A new marketing concept to help you find and keep the right customers.,"This new approach to marketing provides strategies, methods and metrics that all organizations can use. The authors explain that their system, called ""Customer Equity,"" will show you how to organize and target your efforts to acquire and retain customers, and how to make additional sales to them. The book is divided into three sections - the concept, strategies and management - and is full of solid information and useful tools for measuring customer value. The authors supplement the main principles of each chapter with a business case, and present their concepts with real substance and clear thinking. We recommend this book to any marketer interested in the problems of modern competitiveness and marketing to customers in an information-saturated global marketplace."
2,Wrong Perspective,The authors failed to account for value (or equity) being measured from the perspective of the customer (and/or other stakeholders such as employees). It is the percieved equity that a customer holds for the business that entices them to maintain a relationship. It is specifically that equity that businesses should focus on. By studying the dynamics of 'that' equity they can better determine what individuals value and focus resources (where applicable) on making sure the equity is either preserved (elimination of barriers) or enhanced (by exceeding expectations).Businesses don't exist because they have something to sell. They have something to sell because someone is willing to buy it...they need to spend more time figuring out 'why' and enhancing that aspect of the relationship. It's a 'draw' not a 'push'.Based on the title I thought they had it right. They didn't.
5,Dramatic and Nostalgic,"This and the other DVDs of the early 1960s TV show ""Naked City"" are all excellent.The New York locales give the episodes a distinct look. It was very nostalgic for me to see what the city that I grew up in and still work in looked like in 1961.The stories are interesting and unique in that the guest star/criminal is on camera more than the policemen investigating the case.I especially liked the Walter Matthau episode in which he's kidnapped by a Las Vegas showgirl who threatens to kill him unless he makes good on his promise to marry her. The humor of this situation makes this episode a nice light-hearted change of pace from the other more dramatic and poignant ones that are on this disk, such as the Jack Klugman episode revolving around the kidnapping of a little girl.I can't wait for the next batch of ""Naked City"" DVDs to be released."
3,"Great Supporting Characters, Annoying Hero.",Many of the supporting characters were entertaining and funny. Arthur was just plain annoying. Lots of laugh out loud jokes.
4,Worth Seeing,"A worthwhile animated Christmas movie. The action, characters and story were more than enough to keep the kids engaged and there's plenty of humor to keep mom and dad paying attention too. I could re-watch it just to catch all the funny bits I missed in the grandpa and reindeer scenes alone. Funny funny stuff. The animation is well crafted and thought out. They kept it modern with nice touches of the past and not overwrought like some Christmas fare. Definitely good wholesome fun for the whole family, as the cliche goes. I may consider picking this one up for our permanent movie collection. I recommend it."
5,Arthur Christmas,it was nice to see a movie where someone really cared and it was very funny. Arthur Christmas should be watched by everyone.
2,No magic here...,"Very linear story and rather boring. The first half hour was very good but then it fades into obscurity. My 3 year old left the couch and announced, ""I watching Little Einsteins"", and left the room."
2,Not going to be a classic Christmas film,"My wife and I wanted to like Arthur Christmas, but the movie lacked the heart that all great Christmas movies have. None of the Santas were likable, in fact they were downright selfish. It could be hard to explain to a child why 3 of the Santas didn't care about missing one child at Christmas.The jokes aren't funny, the voice acting is so-so, and the story is a bit ridiculous. Pass on this one and watch ""It's A Wonderful Life"" for the umpteenth time instead."
2,Very bad.,The story line was very confusing. Better suited for children. Would not recommend to anyone. Very childish movie. Bad. Bad.
3,Cute family movie with one exception,"This is a cute family movie that is full of heart and well placed humor. My 13 year old daughter and I enjoyed watching it with many LOL and Awww moments! My husband fell asleep in the first five minutes, however. There were three or four times where they actually use phrases and songs that belong to Jesus and name Santa instead. The oldest son sarcastically sings ""Glory in the Highest"" to his dad (who is santa) as a slap in the face in front of all the elves as he arrogantly walks out on his dad. That was done in very poor taste. Without the slams on God, I would' e rated this movie higher."
3,Okay,"This is not for children, there is a lot of adult humor in this movie. I wouldn't watch it again."
5,A nice surprise,One of the better family Christmas films I've seen in a while. I'm more if a grinch so that says something but enjoyed watching with my wife and daughter
4,"Nice story for the kids, watchable for adults","The whole family enjoyed this one. Certainly not a Pixar movie, but that is okay. It is nice that the ending is everyone wins."
3,Not your typical Christmas movie.,I would think twice about letting your kids watch this movie if you want them to believe in traditional Christmas.
2,Stop Pumping Body Piercing Down My Kids' Throats,What is up with the lead elf in the story having a pierced eyebrow and being 'metro?!' All the men in the story are portrayed as idiots.
1,Can't Play It,Tho not likely the movies fault. the Samsung 3D blue ray player would play the movie. Needs some sort of firmware update that not released yet. Makes me very learly about buying any 3D movies going forward.
1,arthur chirstmas,i could'nt see it.it said that i would have it a other kind of record that's it.so i did not veiw it Arthur ChristmasArthur Christmas james McAvoy
1,Bad digital code,"The 3d movie and blue ray are amazing!! We love the movie, the digital copy code will not work!!! Very upset!"
3,Cute,"Not the greatest movie, but its a cute story and my kids really enjoyed it. Cute holiday movie for the family."
5,Excellent story,Didn't see this one coming - VERY cute story that has become a family favorite this Christmas. Hugh Laurie is excellent in this.
5,great family movie,Really a super cute christmas flick. loved the creativity. Would highly recommend this film and even buy it when I can.
4,Very family friendly movie,"I am usually leery of ""kids"" movies as most contain material not suitable for the 6 and under set. Very little in this movie concerned me. There was one uneccessary but quick blip with a crazy guy and a rifle. The images and graphics were really detailed and just plain amazing. All in all a great family holiday movie with a nice message about family redemption."
5,Loved it-,"Perfect for whole family. Best line: Santa, if you are real, why can't I see your house on google earth?"
5,Fantastic,"great movie, enjoyed every minute, the old man and the young runt are more than fun. The ending is most unexpected. Wonderful."
5,One of the best!,"Bought this for me more than for my grandchildren. Everyone loved it at Christmas time. Wonderful movie, great message, great soundtrack."
5,NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND,"This is a great Christmas story for the techno-weenie kid who asks all kind of questions about Christmas. In this updated tale, British accent Santa delivers all of his via a futuristic spaceship looking vehicle piloted by his son Steve. His other son, Arthur diligently answers the mail. After a successful Christmas, it was discovered that one toy was overlooked.While Santa and Steve don't fret over the situation, Arthur and Grandsanta take on the quest the traditional way with a host of reindeer, whose names Grandsanta can't quite remember.This is a funny and heart warming story kids and adults can both enjoy. I was pleasantly surprised in spite of the fact it ignored time zones."
1,My kids lost interest,"Glad I did not buy this movie, only rented. My kids 7, 5 and 2 did not like it at all. Many better options out there."
1,3D DEFECTIVE DONT PLAY,"I just bought a brand new Samsung 3D TV and Samsung Blueray 3D DVD Player. My first 3D movie was going to be this one. 2 New TV's Later and the second New 3D Blue Ray player and 2 New Arthur Christmas 3D Discs we have determined this is NOT A WORKING 3D DISC. I am sure in about a Week a TON of these movies will be coming BACK!!! It's unfortunate I went through a nightmare 4 days with buying a New TV returning and getting another and going through 2 New Blue ray, Oh and an updated Monster 1000 HDMI cable as Thought the Disc I bought from Target could not be Defective!! I want to see the movie, which note it will play in 2d but not the reason I purchased. Just unfortunate this was the first 3D movie I Bought!!!"
1,NOT FOR CHILDREN,I didn't buy this movie because I read the review and this movie is not for children. I also heard on TV that it was not a good movie for children. Grandpa Santa is drunk or drinking beer. Santa missed one child and was told thats ok it was only one child. If a child watches that moveie the child will be wondering if Santa was going to miss him. This movie is more for adults.
5,A MUST HAVE MOVIE 4 ALL,"WOW!!!! When I first rented this movie ... I wasn't sure I (or the kids) would even like it enough to watch the whole thing. BOY WAS I WRONG! I love (and the kind) loved the movie so much we had to buy it. What a great modern twist to Christmas stories. I highly recomend ""Arthur's Christmas"" for everyone."
3,"Not bad, but a couple of things to know","Interesting new take on traditional Christmas stories, with good 3d and animation. Note that it is an English/American collaborative production, and the writing and humor definitely seems to lean on the dry British side, much like Wallace and Grommit. I also picked up on a couple of lines that might be a tiny bit ethinically objectionable (stereotyping) in the US market. But overall it's a good addition to your holiday film library."
3,It was better the second time,"I guess i had higher expectations for this move, it is sow start and i liked better the second time it ends well with good moral."
4,Good family fun,"We watched with our 9 yr old. He enjoyed it - It opens up some further questions but a fun movie to get into the Christmas spirit,"
4,Great family holiday movie,This was a very cute Christmas movie and the whole family liked it. The adventure with the grandpa and Arthur made the kids laugh.
4,Good Family Christmas Movie,I enjoyed watching this film with my 9 yr. old. He enjoyed it as well and thought it was pretty funny. It has a good holiday message.
3,a rating,not unexpected to have the movie arrive...and having a word number requirement for a review is bizzare and not necessary
4,Santa meets James Bond,Cute story that offers a view of Christmas from an overly commercial point of view showing that all the technology in the world should change the fundamental spirit of Christmas.
4,a good solid four stars,"a treat! i expected little, but was surprised at the wit and humor, it was sharp, funny, and touching. Worth watching"
4,very cute,We sat down with the whole family (8 year old and 11 year old) and thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It was surprisingly engaging even for us parents. I recommend this for all families with children especially those who have not yet reached the teen years.
4,nice little christmas movie,"I think youung kids would especially love this movie. It is funny, and batting towards a good family movie all around. Take your everyday goofball son who is the son of Santa and goes out on a journey of his own to deliver a present that was missed by mistake...this is a very heartfelt film and gives you great laughs. I'd say it definitely targets from the toddlers up to at least age 9 but I loved this movie and I'm 20! Definitely a good buy and lengthy too. I think anyone could enjoy Arthur Christmas. This should definitely put a smile on your childs face."
5,For the Movie Only...,"My rating is simply for the movie, not this specific product. My boys 5 & 4 simply loved this movie. My wife & I agreed that this will now be another Christmas classic. We loved the new take on the Kringles operation up in the North Pole. Hahahahhaha"
5,Can I give it SIX stars?,"We saw this in the theater last year, and I can't wait to see it again. Even my cynical teenager loved this movie. It's rare for a movie to please all of us (my kids are 9 and 13) but this movie definitely did. This is a new Christmas classic for us, right up there with the original Grinch."
5,very funny!,it's very rare for me to laugh so hard during a movie. it is big fun. recommend it to young and old.
5,"Best New Christmas Movie in a Long time, sure to be a classic","I love love love this movie. It is so cute, sweet, well-done and teaches some great lessons about the true meaning of Christmas. I think this movie is sure to be a classic. I am an adult, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. However, I think small children would also enjoy it."
4,Good for kids and adults,"Arthur Christmas takes a witty, contemporary approach to the Santa Clause story. Santa's N Pole operation has gone corporate. There are multiple generations of Santa's each more interested in their legacy, and drunk with the power of the role (and in the case of Grandpa Santa, I suspect a bit of schnapps as well) than the role itself. The result is a funny concoction that is a cross between Dilbert and Twas the Night Before Christmas."
5,Great movie!,"It was a cute Christmas movie and would watch it again. My 5 year old loved it, I think she would watch it over and over again."
4,Good holiday movie,Enjoyed the updated holiday theme. It is a fun family movie for everyone to enjoy while preparing for Christmas time.
2,not what i expected,was'nt what i expected all of the santa's were self centered except for arthur. was a big let down to say the least.
3,Cute movie,"This is a cute take on a Christmas movie. My kids really enjoyed it, and it wasn't too bad for an adult to watch, either."
4,Great Christmas Movie!!,"Very Entertaining, held my niece's attention the entire time! Hilarious at times and sweet and meaningful at other moments. Very good! Highly recommend!"
5,"a witty, sweet, aw-shucks movie","This is probably the best Christmas movie to come out in decades (and I'm old enough to say that). Having no kids, I can't critique it as a parent, but personally, I completely enjoyed it as an adult. Put on your ""Scottish ears"" for the elf or put on the subtitles if you can't quite catch what she's saying. I would use ""heart-warming,"" except that might scare off some people - the crotchety ""grandsanta"" nicely off-sets any saccharine tendencies. Watch it twice, at least. You'll appreciate it more each time."
3,GREAT MOVIE,"I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY NIECE , SHE IS 8 YR. OLD , SHE LOVES THIS MOVIE SHE WILL WATCH YEAR AFTER YEAR"
5,Perfect,We watched this movie as a family. My kids loved it. I will probably purchase it to watch again and again.
5,Aurther Christmas,This was a very nice movie to get me and my family in the Christmas spirit we watched it a day or two before Christmas and we loved the story line and the creativity
4,Great movie!,Great movie!Our whole family loved it. Kids ages 8 and 4. Entertaining and fun. Would recommended to other families.
3,"Funny, Cute Movie","This was a really cute Christmas movie--my daughter howled, and there was some funny parts even for me. Good, clean kids show!"
4,A delightful family movie!,"Are you looking for a family friendly (adults AND children), with warmth, humor and intelligence? This one is a winner."
4,Very funny!,Enjoyed it very much. I liked the one liners from grandfather Claus. I enjoyed it so much I watched it twice.
5,Great Film,The whole family loved it! It was great to get everyone in the holiday spirit and even the grumpy kids looked up from their iPhones to watch some of the movie!
4,Pleasant Surprise,Had never heard of this movie before we found it on Amazon Instant Video. We really enjoyed it and plan on including it in our holiday movie classic list.
5,Great Family Movie,"This one was really good. I was surprised because the trailer looked kind of run of the mill. Grandpa Santa played a much bigger role than the ads suggested. Good story, good moral, we had a really great family movie night watching this one."
5,Funny Movie,Very funny - great for kids - the graphics and story content are great. Highly recommend this movie for the family
3,Cute,"My wife and I watched this one evening, and we found ourselves entertained by the story line and the humor."
3,Arthur Christmas....very good!,"Arthur Christmas is an excellent movie to watch on Christmas Eve. Very creative and the animation is very, very good."
4,Holiday program for whole family,This was a different view of what the North Pole and Christmas could be compared to traditional Santa Clause stories. My family and I enjoyed watchingthis show together. It was fun and entertaining for all ages.
4,Kids enjoyed it,"I like new twists on classic Christmas stories, it helps avoid ""holiday media burnout"". This was a nice take on the North Pole."
5,I love it,"This movie was a great on my grand children said Grandma you brought my favior movie, I love you so much we also watch this movie almost every weekend, We have ever friday threw Saturday movies night with the family, that we dont go to the movies."
2,Not great for American audiences,"We found this film heavy on what we felt was (for lack of a better expression), an excess of English (as in UK/GBR) sentiment and cultural norms and memes. This made it difficult for my 7 year old to enjoy...and made it a challenge for the adult audience as well. Some nice twists on the usual ""Santa is real and uses technology"" and ""every child deserves christmas presents,"" themes. My daughter rated a ""Meh, daddy. Just...meh."""
3,Cute,"It was cute, my grandson liked it, so was worth ordering it, he loved the elves. Thank you for offering it."
5,Awesome!,"Love it, so cute:) and I can actually let my children watch it, what a relief. Now days seems like cartoons are made more for us adults. This one is one of our favorites."
5,Great Movie! Love that British humor..,"Loved this movie, I saw it with my young Daugher at the theater. When my Daughter saw the scene with the space ship and all the elves dropping from the ropes to deliver the toys, she turned to me and said ""so that's how they do it"".. I almost had tears in my eyes!"
5,Very well done,"This film was so well done. What a wonderful idea. Touching, funny, clever, adorable. My 8 year old and my 5 year old boys loved it. My husband and I loved it."
4,excellent new take on the Santa story.,Very fun movie. My hubby and I both ended up watching the whole movie with the kiddos rather than just one of us 'suffering' through a children's movie. Technology and Santa? Sounded silly at first but they did an excellent job of it with this movie. No problems with the instant video steaming rental. Will probably rent it again this season. Enjoy!
4,Pleasant Surprise,"We liked it... thought it would be a cheezy movie, but it turned out we liked it. I would even watch it again."
2,Good for (very young) children,"If you have a 4 or 5 year old they will enjoy this movie. Adults, not so much. Ah well, it's Christmas."
4,The whole family enjoyed it.,Cute and quirky take on how technology has affected how Santa delivers gifts. Three generations of Santas consider the reason they work so hard all year to deliver gifts to the world's kids. GranSanta is worth watching all alone.
5,A new favorite!,We absolutely LOVED this movie! Very entertaining for children and adults. This has definitely found a spot in our Christmas movie library!
4,great CHRISTMAS MOVIE,STARTED SLOW BUT GOT BETTER. GOOD STORY ABOUT THE MEANING OF SANTA AND CHRISTMAS. NO CHILD LEFT WITH A GIFT
2,fell asleep,"Seemed like a no brainer that my house would love this movie, but halfway throuh both my kids (ages 4 and 8) went to play something else with daddy and I fell asleep. Not what we thought it would be at all"
4,Fun Christmas movie,"This one had an original story line, excellent animation and enough visual jokes to engage the whole family. None of the nudge, nudge, wink, wink inappropriate humor that goes over the heads of the kids watching, but titillates the adults (thank goodness!). I really enjoyed this one, so did the kids."
5,From what I hear..,"This is a great movie, according to my son, fiance, & a coworker and his sons! I have yet to see it, but from what I've heard, I can't wait to watch."
4,Caribbean review,"I have used this item in three (3) of my vehicles and it has worked very well, and two (2) of these vehicle carry passengers for an average of 13 hours a day and has been doing this for more than a year and a half now,and it has kept my transmission very cool and working smoothly. The only reason i did not give it a 5 Star is because i think there should be longer hoses included in the kit to facilitate different installations."
5,trans cooler for jeep tj,"Nice cooler. I mounted it using some strapping steel from home depot to make brackets in front of the ac condenser in the grill. The instructions say to to mount it right to the radiator or condenser with the supplied plastic bolts. Dont do this. If you can, always try and keep an air gap for better cooling. There is a nice air gap between my new cooler bracket, ac condenser, and radiator. You can't beat these flex coolers for the price. The plate style coolers are stronger but two to three times more expensive. If you ever damage the fins on these flex coolers just yank it and replace it, still cheaper.For the jeepers out there: everyone suggested the 18000 tow capacity cooler, this one is the 20000 rated cooler and it fits perfectly inside the tj grill. When mounting make sure to allow enough space for your hoses to clear and not get kinked where they head down towards the radiator outlet."
1,JUNK,would give a zero for product failure I have a variable speed angle grinder makita very nice and even 1000 rpm ripped this to shreds in a matter of minutes
1,Very bad,"Low quality of blades, are made of very brittle steel. I used this auger once, 8 wells drilled. Now this auger unusable because blade blunt.Marketing hype! In product title ""mora"", but this isn't brand Mora, this is chinese factory."
4,"Works well, happy with purchase","I only ice fish once a year, so have no need for a power auger. I was able to crank through 36 inches (yeah 36 inches!) of ice in 5 to 10 minutes. Three holes was enough of a workout for me, but this auger works just fine for my infrequent needs."
5,Great auger,"I use the 6"" Mora model. It is great to backpack up to mountain lakes. The adjustable length is good and it comes apart to pack. Only weighs 6 pounds. Be sure to get a blade guard."
2,Comes with garbage blades,"I have two of the 8"" augers. Both new this year. Both came with low quality blades. As far as I know the replacements strikemaster sells are still quality, but for some reason they are putting absolute trash blades on the new augers.My augers have each broken 1 of the two blades during normal gentle use. I was lucky enough that opposite blades broke on each, so I still have one functional auger. I've contacted Strikemaster and fully expect them to send me a replacement set of blades."
5,the best for educated budget travel!,"Rick Steves' books are ideal for independent travelers on a budget who want to get the most out of their time & money. This book is for anyone who wants to experience the culture, history, & modern fun of France. The accomodation & food tips are step up from the grungy backpacker fare that the Let's Go series recommends, yet still modestly priced. Rick hits all the major tourist sites, but also shows you cozy, local spots where you can relax & really get into the country. I recently used this book & his more in-depth Paris book for 2 weeks in France & found the books to be an ideal tour guide. I've used his other books for European trips, & I'm never disappointed."
2,Not Very Impressed With This Book.,"This was our 2nd time using a Rick Steve's book (the first was the Italy guide book, which was great)...and I found the France guidebook lacking depth. He touches large portions of the country with the guidebook, but the regions we visited (Provence, Alps, and Paris) were void of much detail. In particular, we found the sight-seeing recommendations to be quite skimpy. The restaurant and hotel recommendations were ok, but we found our favorite hotels on-line or in a different guidebook. If you get this book, be sure to only use it as a companion to a more comprenesive guide, such as Lonely Planet or Fodor's!!"
1,BIG MESS !!!!!!!!! Totally terrible,This so called educational toy was a great disappointment to me. the pieces are impossible to keep organized and the play suggestion is too complicated and nonsensical.
3,Pleasant and thoughtful.,"I like this book, but I don't feel inspired by it. Benvie's photographs and text tend to be low-key and thoughtful, but they don't send me out in the field to make my own."
2,Boring!!,"It's just plane boring!! Very little, if any information on photographing landscapes; it just seems to ramble. No mention of what cameras or camera sizes used, just rambles on about nothing. No technical information and the photographs are made in europe. What little hard information there is, is in the metric system...all in all, not nearly worth the cost of the book."
2,It Leaks,"Within a few uses, this iron began to leak through the holes in the ironing surface, regardless of the heat setting used."
3,An interesting pot pourri of articles on an important topic,"There is a wide variance between the 11 contributing authors.Some of them give stimulating eye witness accounts of events in Seattle, or detailed case studies of criminal activities from around the globe.Then we get others who just give you their opinion on an issue, expressed so academically that with one of them I was desperately looking for any indication of form of who / what / where / when that might have contributed to the development of their ideas.So for those who cited the evidence - 4 or even 5 stars - but for those who gave rather sterile theoretical opinions - 2 stars.And what a shame there was no Index."
2,Damaged,First picture came damaged and the replacement didn't come for a couple of months. It was supposed to be a birthday present for my daughter.
1,CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP,"I wanted this for my 15 month old son. I got it out of the box and turned the handle once and the clown popped up. After that, we couldn't get him back in, and it wouldn't play music all together. The size was also much smaller than we thought. Very cheaply made...we sent it right back for our whoppin' [money] refund."
1,Would not recommend,"I would not recommend purchasing this Jack in the Box. First of all, when it used to work, you could not hear the music it was so faint. Now the thing doesn't even work, and we've had it less than 1 year. My daughter keeps bringing it to me with a sad look on her face saying it's ""broke"" and wants me to fix it. I turn and turn it and nothing happens. So now I have to go buy her another one - definitely a different brand!"
1,Thank You for warning me about buying this item,I was looking for a Cute Jack n the box for 2 grandchildren for Xmas. I will not purchase this one. I too am shocked that Toys r Us is selling a poor product. I will offer 1.00 each for this item with free shipping. (-:
1,Shelcore Jack is a failure,I am very disappointed in this toy. I was going to send it back but found out it would cost as much to send it back as I paid for it.Music won't play and Jack won't stay in his box.Cute little face so I will give it one star.
2,you get what you pay for,"this toy is very cheaply made. the jack never pops out of its box on time, sometimes won't pop out, and sometimes won't go back in. the musical tune is not recognizable. the crank on the side is difficult for me to turn, impossible for my 18 month old. if you want the joy and laughter that comes from a jack in the box ---- do not buy this one."
4,"Price is right... fun for children, fast delivery","Would have given it 5 stars, but it's all plastic. I grew up with the metal box type, so when this came in the mail, was a little let down it was total plastic. Course, for less than $10, it's worth that."
1,Not worth $10,"This jack in the box is cute, but not very exciting. The winding handle plays the ""mulberry bush"" tune, but it sounds like the little music wheel isn't made very well. The song comes out poorly timed and very faint. All in all, its a good little party favor toy, but it's not worth ..."
3,to hard to turn,My son enjoys it when I play with it. He has a hard time turning the handle. It is also hard for him to shut the lid and get the clown back into the box. His little fingers get in the way. My son is very interested in the sounds and when the clown pops up but i feel that the handle should be bigger so my son can turn it and enjoy the toy. Thank You
1,big disappointment,"How can I give this to my eighteen-month old when I cannot even use it easily? The clown is very tough to push down and you have to keep holding it down while you try to close the lid; hopefully the handle will be in the correct position for the lid to actually latch. The ""music"" played while turning the crank is a tinny assortment of clinks, which it could be argued vaguely resemble ""Pop Goes the Weasel.""I can't even give this toy to the local toy drive, as I can imagine the disappointment of the child receiving this worthless toy."
1,You'll just send it back...,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter, but I'm glad I tried it out before I wrapped it. It's hard to crank in the ""right"" direction. The tune (if you can call it that) is SO off key that I can't imagine *wanting* to turn it after the first time. Not only that, but the clown (which stayed down fine on mine) didn't even pop out at the right part of the song. I put it right back in the box and returned it the next day, thinking that it was better for my daughter to have fewer gifts than to receive this very inferior one."
1,Poor Craftsmanship,I bought this toy for my daughter for Christmas last year and she was so excited when she opened it. She took it out of the box and started to wind it. The jack in the box popped out before the song was over and you never could get the lid to close in order to try it again. It made her so mad and because of that she hasn't touched it since. This is a cheap toy of poor quality.
1,What a piece of junk,"The only thing my son likes about it is how the clown pops up, but he can't work it himself so he gets no enjoyment from it. The music sounds like we got the toy from someone's garbage can."
2,Y so hard to find a plain ole jack in the box?,"An old fashion jack in the box is often recommended in developmental literature for babies but SOOOO hard to find! We purchased this, seemed like a no brainer but like the others my children have difficulty operating (even after 3 years).It's okay but there must be a better model somewhere???"
3,Jack is a disappointment,"I got this toy for my 9 month old for Christmas! He really acted intrested in the toy, but soon got bored with is as the jack wont stay in the box long enough to play the music. It sure is not like the one I had when I was a kid. I am truly disappointed in this toy and would not recommend buying this for any kid. Find a better one to spend your money on!"
4,"Good idea, bad design","My 10 month old loved this toy. He loved the song and would laugh when Jack popped up. (We did not have a problem with the volume as some other reviewers have mentioned). Unfortunately, I had to return it two days later because the catch mechanism on the cover that keeps Jack down wasn't designed very well. Jack did not stay down and popped up with only half a turn on the crank (although I could keep my hand on the cover and let Jack pop up at the end of the song, which thoroughly delighted my son). If you want to get a jack-in-the-box for your child, your money may be better invested in another one."
1,wimpy,"I was very excited about getting a jack in the box for my son, but quickly became dissappointed when we started playing with this one. The handle is very awkward to turn and you can hardly hear the music. This toy is not fun."
1,"Do not buy, Very low quality toy","When I received the item I could not believe toys r us through amazon was selling such garbage. The toy is very low quality. At most it should sell for [$$$]. I am very disappointed, and worst very worried since if companies like toys r. us is selling low quality items at premium prices, what can I expect from other companies."
2,Jack in the Box,This Jack in the Box is pretty flimsy. Not worth the price. Would have returned it but it would have not been worth the expense.
1,A Sad Jack,The toy plays 2 notes and jack pops out. Something is very wrong with the design. I am glad we read the reviews before we shippedthe toy to my grandson. What a shame. It's not like the ones we used to know.
1,I should have paid attention to the reviews,"Although this toy is very colorful, it is sadly lacking as an entertaining toy. The music is horrible, it's off-key and I have to wind the handle in reverse to get the clown back in. My 9 mo. son barely glanced at it before he went on to another toy. I will buy a more expensive one next time, certainly one that has better reviews."
1,Find a different jack in the box,"I was initially so excited to get my daughter (18 months at the time)her first jack in the box. Unfortunately, this one is horrible!!!! It was ordered on line and it never worked from the time we received it. The lid won't stay shut and the music sounds horrible. We ended up having to buy a different one which we were able to find at Babies R Us locally. If there were an option to pick less than one star, I would have, especially for duarbility!!"
