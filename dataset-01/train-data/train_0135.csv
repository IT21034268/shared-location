5,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (DVD/Two-Disc Blu-ray + BD Live w/DVD packaging) [Blu-ray],My wife loves Disney so what better than Snow White! This was a great Christmas gift. I wish it had a digital copy but its not a problem.
5,The Best DVD Disney Has Ever Released,"The most important movie in Disney history, this 1937 gem has gotten a superb dvd treatment. Words cannot describe how flawless this dvd is. It is the best treatment I have ever seen on any dvd. I will not bore you with plot details, as everybody knows what this film is all about. I will say, however, that the film looks and sounds great. They also loaded it with extras. Dozens of documentaries, interviews and much more are littered throughout this magical I wish I could say more, but my praise for this dvd cannot be expressed in mere words. In order to see what I mean, you have to buy the dvd for yourself and see how great it is. And of course, watch the film, too. It remains a classic."
5,Great Diamond classic in High Definition,"When I got this DVD combo pack, I was impressed by the cover and the packaging. I watched the Blu-Ray in my room the day after. For those of you confused about the Blu-Ray and DVD combo packs, this is how it works. Blu-Ray combos involve the small, blue package with the DVD behind the Blu-Ray discs. The DVD combo has the Black edged packaging with the DVD in front of the Blu-Ray discs. I liked the DVD combo better because of it's nice cover and grip. If you want it in Hd, buy the DVD combo pack."
1,Benny01,Wasted a lot of time to only received blank DVD's twice. The company never offered to send a good DVD.
3,A Disney Classic come to Blu-Ray...,"...but, despite it's digital resolution tweaks, Snow White (while dear to many people's nostalgic hearts) is still one of the weakest of the library.A relic of its era, with cupie doll voice actress Adriana Caselotti in the title role, the songs are quaint but not really thrilling. The story is typical early Disney (what with it being Disney's first feature) with plenty of physical comedy and a handsome prince who wakes the dear maiden with a kiss.Definitely something for the kids, but not as accessible to adults as the early Disney shorts were. It's innocent and light and really rather harmless.Still, the special features are to die for and it's great to see the vault open (""for a limited time only~"") like they do every decade or so... a typical consumer would probably be safe with the only the DVD edition, the Blu-Ray being only necessary for collectors."
1,Doesn't Work on all players,"I would love for my kids to see this DVD, but Disney fails to tell you this disc does not work on all DVD players. Mine being a Panasonic. I contacted Disney and they said they were aware of the problem and would send me another Disney title or my money back, but of course I had to pay to ship it to them. Thanks Disney for again ripping me off."
2,Won't play in our DVD Players!,"It only plays on one of our 4 DVD players! Very irritating. We love snow white, but sucks that it only works on one player"
5,Snow White,Item is just how i expected. Great condition. The movie works great and i can add it to my collection.
4,Diamond Edition DVD Packaging,I am just curious from customers who have already bought this particular Standard Diamond DVD Edition if the special features are Standard DVD compatible?
5,Awesome!,"How can you not love Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in Blu-ray; especially at the great price that Amazon offers. It is just like watching it the for the first on the big screen ---- wow, that was 58 years ago."
5,"wonderful movie, wonderful price","I purchased this movie for my two preschool daughters. Normally, I would not have purchased a blu-ray (extra cost) but with the discount code I only paid 12.97 including s&h. I could not have bought a dvd for that. My girls love the movie."
5,Wow - just look at all the special features!,"I couldn't even count all the special features I saw here on Amazon.com for this DVD of SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS. This animated film is truly a masterpiece, partly because it was Disney's first ever. You all know the story of Snow White, so I don't have to write a plot summary. I'm pretty impressed by all the special features that this DVD edition has. If you love this film, then I highly recommend you get this DVD edition - it'll be a DVD to treasure for years to come!"
1,Rip off!,"Amazon isn't watching closely or they don't care! Movie is in Korean! Maybe I should have noticed, but who is expecting this kind of sham! Never again will I trust Amazon."
2,A Waste For An American,"Do not buy this if you can't speak the Asian Language (i can't identify which it is) that it's in. It can be put in English, but for the money you spend on this one, you could buy one in English. I was really mad because the description did not say it isn't originally in English.. don't make the same mistake I did."
4,the first and one of the best for sure.,"Next year this movie will be 70 years old.It is still a visual treat!The animation is very detailed and beautiful, the colors after restoration have become full and alive. The scene where the Wicked Queen transforms herself into the old hag is still frightful and stunning.She is my favorite character of the movie.The story is funny, frightening and sweet at once. A true classic that everyone should own, regardless of how hard a copy is to buy these days..."
4,Timeless,"Chose this for my grandchildren and we all are enjoying it. It arrived quickly, looks brand new and the animation looks fresh. I was afraid it would look like an ""old"" time movie they wouldn't want to watch. Good buy."
5,The one that started it all...,the first feature length animated movie...the movie that started it all for the disney studios. The first disney masterpiece and this is a beautiful disney dvd..and teh first disney platinium edition.
4,A great DVD even for non-Snow White fans,"Snow White is one of the greatest animated films of all time, and thus deserves the golden treatment for DVD. For once, the home video department at Disney doesn't fail us.Both discs included allow you to fully understand the process behind making Snow White. Areas like the Abandoned Concepts, Deleted Scenes, and the Camera Tests are all fasinating. The archival radio recordings and trailers too are a great look at the past.I do have to note that some of the extras glorify Disney (the company) maybe a little much. The ""Disney Through the Decades"" extra is wasted, what with Jodi Benson and Ming-Na telling us how great it is that Disney has their own hockey team and such.But dispite these flaws, Snow White is still a must own disc. The film still holds as a classic, and the extras are definately worth checking out. There may be better DVDs, but I honestly can't think of any off the top of my head."
4,Great DVD - Visually stunning,"This is a great DVD - the picture is so clear it is amazing! [I never realized how bad our video copy was until I saw this DVD!]. My preschooler LOVED Dopey's mine ride [the game] and she also enjoyed ""goddess of the spring"" [an animated short included]. The history and information included is very interesting [though I do agree with an earlier reviewer who said it was a little too ""Wow, isn't Disney just the best ever?!! We rule!!""]. But it was enjoyable none-the-less.My one complaint - this DVD doesn't include the Spanish Language version of the film [which I *know* is already done and available on Video ""Blanca Nieve...""]. We use our Disney DVDs to teach our children Spanish [its working Great, by the way]. Why on Earth, in a DVD this comprehensive, would Disney leave out the Spanish Language version? They included the French... We were very dissappointed."
5,Snow White Blu-Ray,"Haven't seen this since childhood, many decades ago. Forgot how delightful this film really is. Recommend it to everyone, whether you have children or not. It will bring out the child in you as you reflect."
5,Superb picture and sound quality,"If you are a fan of the Disney Classics, you have to pick up Snow White on Blu-Ray/DVD Combo. They film has been remastered and has never looked or sounded better. We previously had Snow White on VHS and the difference between the two is astounding.In case you haven't seen Snow White, I have to tell you to beware as it is quite violent. I watched it with my daughter and I was shocked at how much more violent it was than I remembered it. The Wicked Witch orders the hunter to kill Snow White and cut out her heart. There is also a seen in which the hunter is standing behind Snow White with a knife, in position to stab her. So, this may not be the best movie to watch with your little one. You might want to watch it first and fast forward through the scary parts when watching with a child."
5,Another Disney favorite,Never too old for this Disney classic. LOVE the Blu-Ray + standard DVD combo.
2,Case in bad condition,"Came and I assume it will play fine but the discs will not stay hooked in the package it is so damaged. It has looks like it has been smashed and barely stays closed, is cracked, and the back plastic cover is ripped. I knew it was used but I still expected the packaging to be in better condition for the price."
3,"Good story, but I just don't like it","Snow White has a fine story line, but I have still never liked this movie. I don't like Snow White's singing voice. It tends to bug me a lot because she uses too much vibrato. I think that is really the only thing that really bugs me about it. The story is fun, though, and kids love it."
1,Disappointed,Very disappointedReached without the pack cardboard coatingAlthough the picture indicates that there is a cardboard caseI was very disappointedImportant Amazon Disney items will indicate whether or not coated cardboard pack.It is Ahshuah front disc
4,Good quality product,The dvd arrived in the specified time frame and was in wonderful condition upon arrival. I would buy from this group again.
1,Disk is defective - does not play,"First of all, great movie: much anticipated by familyBut: it does not play in DVD players, computer DVD drives (this is the regular not the blu-ray version). It almost appears to have a ""ridge"" around the outside of the disc. Apparently I'm not the only one with the problem; I'm planning to return it to Amazon and hope that a second one will be better...."
1,Defective disc,"Sadly, I got a defective disc and it will not allow me to even see the picture quality. Since this was a free item to me, I cannot exchange it, so I feel forced to leave a 1 star rating, which is a bummer..."
1,Very Disappointed,"I was purchasing this product as a ""New"" item. Not only was the packaging open and obviously used before. But the Jewell Case was damaged, and cut my childs finger the very first moment she held it.This seller misrepresents his products. Be very careful. Or better yet, stay away from this seller."
1,The DVD did not work,The dvd I received did not work. I wrote to the company who sent it and told them. They have yet to respond. I am not happy with this transaction.
4,One Of Disney's All-Time Greats Looking Better & Better,"This was Walt Disney's first animated full-length movie. I've read where it took somewhere between two to five years to make, and the artwork still stands up to today's standards.t was good to see Disney releasing a nice Blu-Ray of this. It's pretty sharp and up to the Disney Blu-Ray standards. It makes a great movie all the more great. Not only is the picture improved, but so is the sound, and so is the regular DVD.....so you get a lot of bang for your buck here.The story is ""cute"" because of the seven dwarfs. The evil character - the queen - doesn't have that big a role so most of the time it's just a sweet, enjoyable film with nice characters. It's one of the those movies that makes you feel good as you are watching it."
1,snow white & the seven dwarfs,"totally screwed on this one, it is not in English as listed. I never thought this would happen.."
3,Timeless Classic for a okay format,"I would have to say that this was a pretty impressive remaster by Disney. It looked pretty good for a SD dvd release. I would also like to point out that the Blu-ray version looks much cleaner. I would recommend this product only to those who just want the dvd version of the movie. However, I would recommend the ""Diamond Edition"" Blu-ray more for the enthsiast. This version also includes a dvd copy of the movie. Even if you don't have a Blu-ray player it still would not hurt to have an HD version of the film, especially if you already have an HDTV set. This release was fine for what dvd can produce as far as picture quality.Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"
5,Absolute Classic,Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs is a Disney Classic! The Blu- Ray is the best way to go to view this film for the quality is unbelievably good. The picture quality is so sharp it is the best print I have ever seen. In this package you get both the blu ray and the DVD copy which was a nice bonus.
5,A little scary,I thought that my three year old granddaughter would love this movie because she is so into all of the Disney Princess thing. She was okay with it until the Wicked Witch came on. Got very scared and won't watch it. I love it and will put it away until she is a little older.
4,"Great film, great shape",One of the greatest animated films of all time. What a pleasure to share it with my daughter. She loves it!
5,Politely responsive,Movie was in a foreign language. Seller was very friendly & cooperative in email response and reimbused me without any problems.
3,Snow White and the seven dwarfs,Upon viewing the dvd it appeared to be a copy and not an original product. The movie played fine and my grandchildren are happy but I am dissappointed that I was decieved.
5,loved it!,My child is 6 and wants more of these wonderful stories - we play them in the car and at home and her French is really improving - plus it is just fun for her!Thank you Mrs. Foster for creating these tapes.
3,A fairly good puzzle,"This puzzle is definitely not my favorite, but it's okay. My main problems are as follows:I think the 6 and 9 should be either different enough to make it clear which is which, or interchangeable. As it is, they are just similar enough to confuse the kiddo.This doesn't do much as far as teaching numbers. I try to show my daughter that it goes in order, and you can count from the beginning to figure out what number the piece is, but she just doesn't get it.As far as a simple ""match the piece to its place"" puzzle goes, this one is all right at that."
3,Shekinah's Mom,"My two year old and I like this puzzle. We also use the puzzle pieces as stencils. We trace the puzzle pieces and color them on a sheet of paper. We sing counting songs and pull out M&M candies (counting the number of candies in correlation with the puzzle piece we're using) to enhance our fun time with this puzzle. I do agree that the 6 and the 9 puzzle pieces are quite similar, but it's an opportunity to introduce the concept that the numbers 6 and 9 are numbers that are similar looking. My two year old that counts to 20, does play with this puzzle by herself. As well, I've seen her showing her doll how to put the puzzle pieces in. I recommend this puzzle to creative teachers and Moms."
5,Sweet blues man,"Travis Haddix is like fine wine.His voice and music is so smooth.If you like later B.B.King this is your man.The song like ""Through With Love"" will bring you to tears.Trust me this album is total blues.BUY IT!!!!"
3,Interesting and Boring,"This is a collection of around 10 articles all on the subject of preaching. Though it won 1999 Book of the Year from Preaching Magazine, I'm not sure what the fuss is about. Some of the articles are indeed interesting, such as the one about researching one's own culture in addition to the biblical culture. We will be unable to connect our listeners to the text if we are not knowledgeable about the situation and culture of our listeners.This book is a tribute to Haddon Robinson, and the contributers don't let you forget that. Many of them re-explain ""Big Idea"" preaching, so that you end up reading the same thing several times.Anyway, there are some good points. The main gist of the book is that Big Idea preaching is a philosophy which can be applied to almost any biblical passage and any preaching method."
5,Superb !,"If you are a traditional Jazz fiend you will LOVE this CD to bits its great all the musicians play superbly evoking thoughts of smoke filled basements time long gone,a truly great CD excellent!!"
4,K.D. at his best,"This is a very interesting and innovative album. Kenny Dorham, one of the American innovators of afro-cuban jazz, really comes through with some great cuts on this album. Backed by fantastic sidemen like the masterful J.J. Johnson on trombone, the first half of the album really grooves. Unfortunately, the ""b-side"" of the album is generally uninteresting, moderate mainstream jazz. While the first half is laden with latin rythms and interesting and complex horn harmonies, the second half of the album basically moves on autopilot. All in all though, this is a very cool album that is a must have for any Kenny Dorham fan."
3,Afro-Cuban Kenny Durham CD,Good for its historical place. I bought to hear JJ. What I didn't enjoy so much was the confused-sounding clash between swinging and straight time.
5,Kenny's First Classic CD - (bonus tracks OK not great).,"Recorded in 1955, Afro-cuban is Kenny Dorham's first classic album. Kenny had the complete package. He had a beautiful tone, amazing chops, and he was a great composer. It is a wonder why he is not more reknown. The first five tracks on this reissue are all latin/jazz classics. They are an essential part of every jazz library. The bonus tracks included on the re-issue aren't quite the same caliber as the first part of the CD. They are more standard hard bop tunes that latin jazz tunes, and are from a different recording session.The first five tracks feature an all star lineup:Kenny on trumpet, J.J. Johnson on trombone, Hank Mobley on tenor sax, Cecil Payne on baritione sax, Horace Silver on piano, Oscar Petiford on bass, Art Blakey on drums, and Carlos 'Potato' Valdes on conga ... wow!I highly recommend this album along with just about all Kenny's albums."
5,Durable!,"Bought this as a present for my father-in-law. He really liked it- it's perfect for him. It's just the right size to hold all of his cards and money- but most of all, it's durable!"
2,Who would want to read it?,"With a title like this, yes, I would want to read it. I'm ashamed of being an introvert. Poor paying jobs where you are shoved into the back of the comapny and forgotten. All the while the extroverts with millions of job choices are making the big money. Friends don't call because you have little to say. People don't remember you when you were with them at an event or party. The title is what I want, but the book behind the cover is seriously lacking the content that I need."
1,Poor design,While the idea was good the execution was poor. The suction cup is so weak that the one year old had no trouble at all ripping it up from whatever surface it was on. Warm water put in the bottom leaks out and the inside of the tank never dries.
3,baby dish,I guess they are ok. I have a great deal of trouble seperating them. Would not buy another one. Thanks
1,Don't waste your money,"This is a thrown-together paste-up that wouldn't receive a C grade at a backwoods high school. There isn't enough good information here so the editors resort to useless lists of nuclear facilities (like power reactors) to fill pages. It is poorly editied with many typos. It is built around several news articles that can be accessed for free by simply typing the phrase ""Dirty Bomb"" into Google. Penguin has some nerve charging $12.95 for this."
5,"A complex, thorough review of the history of the region","This outstanding book provides a thorough historical review from 1300 to 1997. The cast of true caracters is so immense that the book was difficult to follow in the beginning, but gradually it all came together into a gripping account that brings the reader right up to the events of today. The photos and maps are very helpful in following the events from this complex region - and this book is the best I have read on the subject."
3,Nothing I've never heard before.,I bought this on a whim. I had no real expectations so naturally im not dissapointed. Its not horrible and it is worthy of entering my music library. I just wasent that impressed with it. To me it sounds similar to the latest Children of Bodom album and some of the earlier works of Soilwork.
2,i've heard it before,"""hey i know a couple of chords, can i be in your band?""this is the most simplistic, unimaginative and boring album i've heard in a while. don't get me wrong, the production is good and so is the mixing, but the average length of the songs are just over 3 minutes. now if we were talking about ultra-fast black metal, then that time length might be acceptable, but this music is so simple and unforceful and slow, then it better be really catchy and about 2 minutes longer... otherwise, STOP WASTING MY TIME!! i'm sorry but this album (is) bad. there is nothing impressive about this album at all so don't even waste your money on it, trust me."
5,I LOVE SWEDEN!,"This is one of the greatest Metal Albums ever! From the opening of ""Blinded by Fear"" to the calm kickout ""The Flames of the End"" this is musical genius in the same vain as you can find on old Iron Maiden, Cradle of Filth or Tiamat! Every song has a great melody line and great Lyrics. If you want to know what effect Bands like At the Gates had on the Scene check out Soilwork or In Flames, you can hear a hughe influence of At the Gates Style on them! ( what doesn't mean that they are copycats ) Any Metal Fan should own this Album, right after Slayer's Regin in Blood. If I had to decide one Death Metal Album I could add to my collection my choice would be At the Gates!"
2,Highly overrated...more like 2.5 stars.,"After they peaked with ""Terminal Spirit Disease"", ATG decided to strip down their sound. This is their most popular release because it is their most melodic and accessible. Gone are the progressive compositions and what is left are recycled riffs put into a quasi-thrash metal form. It sort of sucks that their last album sounds like a rushed attempt to get more fans and, in the process, sacrificing their originality."
3,what's all the shouting about?,"I really don't get what all the fuss is concerning this album. It's good, but not THAT good. It's okay. They play fast, the songs are well-structured, etc., but there is nothing spectacular about this band in the way that Childen of Bodom, Dimmu Borgir or In Flames can be spectacular. This is average stuff."
1,Charlatanism,"This is a ripoff. Progressive death metal band At the Gates replaced the creativity at the core of their music with predictable rock n roll harmony, stitched it into speed metal and shoved it back into the remains of their sound. Their instrumentalism is so good most people won't notice, but this album is boring and a complete sellout not worth the plastic it is minted on. Unless you like to drum your intelligence out your ears with sonic conformity, avoid this sham. Bleh."
4,Overrated.,"Dont get me wrong I love at the gates style and all but this record simply dosnt hold the intensity of the first few tracks past the half way mark. Overall this is a very good cd tho, exellent production, awsome vox, great guitar and drum work, its got all you could want in a death metal record I only wish it had more quallity tracks. \m/"
5,"The ""Reign in Blood"" of death metal","If there ever was an essential purchase for a death metal fan this album would be it. In the roots of the New Wave of Swedish Death Metal, At the Gates stood high above the rest. Although somewhat comparable in brutality and catchiness to ""Clandestine"" by Entombed, ""Slaughter..."" has much stronger songwriting and much more tighter and well-constructed songs. The sound here is fast, razor-sharp duel-guitar harmonies, pounding double-bass and shrieking, ungodly vocals. There's not a bad cut on the record even though some of the luster wears off by the end. At the time this was released this was the most brutal and complete death metal albums I had ever heard. If you don't own this, but it now."
5,Perfection,"Insanely awesome band, perfect album. Even better due to the extras in this version. Highly recommended."
5,Blinded by Awesomeness,"(I would have given this 4.5 stars if they gave me the option)While this isn't the best Death Metal album ever released, it is ridiculously consistant, with the obvious highlights being Blinded by Fear, Slaughter of the Soul, and World of Lies. Also, the softer tracks, Cold and Unto Others, are excellent in their own right. Really, there is nothing bad on this album, and I can only say good things about the song Blinded by Fear. It has one of the best metal riffs ever, which is surprisingly catchy, and leads into 3 or 4 other riffs that are almost as good! This song just never gets old."
5,This CD is EPIC,I don't even like Death Metal and this is one of the best CDs I have ever heard. Amazing music with incredible vocals. You will not be disapointed. Thanks to my husband for forcing me to listen to it. Unbelieveably moving!
5,Come on now Rob,"Judging from your review is sounds as though you think ATG took after Soilwork and CoB. You must know that this album was released two years Before Soilwork's: Steelbath Suicide and CoB's: Something Wild. ATG paved the way for bands like Soilwork, and continue to have an impact on extreme metal more than 10 years they disbanded."
3,Not that great,"Hats off to them for making music. I am a staunch fan of ""The Red"" through ""Terminal"". However compared to the excitingness and unpredictableness of those albums, ""Slaughter"" is truly is lacking. There is not tempo change honestly it is somewhat lacking in melody. So yeah, sure it is fist pumping and all of that. But honestly I think they should have taken it beyond the mindless pre-post metal/metalcore that is presented here and added their old traits of tempo change, melody, odd timing, and longer songs.It just doesn't work for me."
2,Hmmm...,"Hmmm...I don't think much of this. In my opinion, book III wrapped things up quite nicely; this seems more like an afterthought than anything else. It wasn't Weis's greatest work ever, but it was pretty good. This last book seems highly unnecessary to me. And I really thought that bringing back Derek Sagan was not a good idea; the way he ended up after book III was quite appropriate. Death is just so predictable and boring an end for him. You can safely stay away from this."
3,"Totally Unnecessary, but interesting","I was surprised to find another book in the Star of the Guardians series, since King's Sacrifice seemed to wrap things up so well. I agree that this book isn't up to the standard of the previous 3, but I admit that I enjoyed the story a great deal, with the exception of Maigrey's struggles with ""radiant beings."" Dion's wife is certainly not what I expected, and brings a good twist to Dion's life. The ending is weak, and I especially loathed the Epilogue, which nearly ruined the whole series for me. If you read this book, do yourself a favor and stop reading at the end of chapter twelve."
5,great cd single import,this has to be one of the greatest cd import singles fear factory is the best they rock they are out standing i love them i first heard of these songs when i baught the new cd obsolete the digipack that came out in 98 in japan and i loved them i recommend this cd and any other fear factory cd and also look at static-x if you love fear factory you will love static-x they are great the cd comes out soon on march 23 1999 so be sure to check it out see ya
4,Amazing for the most part,"This book is great in nearly every way. It is well organized by year and the photographs are very rare. The set up when it comes to the photographs needs work. Often, a photograph is cut in half by the center of the book. Despite this, it is one of the best books for Romanov fans and fans-to-be. To see the photographs shows you how Russia's last Imperial Family lived. Absolutely amazing and definitely a must read."
4,Pretty Goood,"It had many Romanov pictures I had never seen before. I don't know if it was worth the $105 I paid for it, but I really do like it. A good book for my collection."
1,Makes you appreciate what others have done with this music,"These quintets are among the most sublime creations that I know of. Nothing of that beauty is captured, however, in these recordings. The sound and performances are cold, harsh, mechanical, and rushed - exactly the opposite of what these pieces require.I would reccommend the exquisite recordings by the Grumiaux ensemble and that of the Talich Quartet.But, it would almost be worth the price of this album to also buy this one so that you could truly appreciate what Grumiaux and Talich have to offer."
5,Twins Favorite,Our Babies love this CD. It is also a big favorite with the grownups. I have been caught singing songs from it without babies being present.
1,Defective,"Notorious is a favorite movie of mine, and when I bought the DVD of it, I was so looking forward to seeing an uncut, unedited version of it. The purchase of the DVD didn't produce the result I was hoping for. My DVD/Blu-Ray player would play only about half the movie; about at the halfway mark in the film, it stopped, as though in a movie theater the film had been cut. The problem was that the disc was scratched and pitted to the point where at about halfway through the film my DVD/Blu-Ray player just refused to play on. And it wasn't as though I'd played the DVD several times, and the disc had gotten scratched and pitted as a result of carelessness in use and/or storage. First time out of the box, the DVD stopped playing midway through the film. I'm ticked off about this, and I haven't the foggiest idea about how to go about getting the situation fixed."
5,"A great film, great cast at their prime","This is truly one of the greatest Hitchcock films. Cary Grant is at his all-time best as is Ingrid Bergman and their chemistry sizzles. (The famous kiss scene got around time limits set by censors of the period by--barely-- breaking up the actual liplock from time to time as they work their way to the door.) No wonder Hollywoood paired them again in their later years, but ""Indiscreet"" couldn't touch the magic of ""Notorious."" I've watched and re-watched this one more than I can count. The plot is interesting, characters complex, the setting intriguing, and-of course-the camera angles are superb."
5,"Can't get better than this...Cary grant, Hitchcock. Great on a rainy afternoon.","If you love Hitchcock you will love this movie. It is B&W and old, but still classic. I've seen it many times but every once in a while I get in the mood for a good old Hitchcock movie. this fits the bill."
4,"Great acting, but where was the suspense...","Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman did an amazing job acting in ""Notorious."" I also loved the creativity in the camera shots and angles, with some of the most creative ones coming from Bergman's point-of-view, in my opinion.The film didn't have the level of suspense that I expected it might. In fact, I didn't really really the movie had much suspense at all until well over halfway into it. The film also dragged in some parts, as did many other Hitchcock films. Nonetheless, Ingrid Bergman's wodnerful acting makes up for all this.I think this film is a must-see for any Hitchcock fan or any fan of classic movies. While it's not my favorite Hitchcock film, it holds its own amidst some very stiff competition (My favorite is a tie between ""Rear Window"" and ""Psycho""). It's also aged very well, like a fine wine, or whatever they keep in the cellar."
3,I kept waiting for something to happen.,"CAUTION: CONTAINS SPOILERS!I was expecting this film to be wonderful given the pedigrees of the cast, director, and screenwriter and the nearly unanimous rave reviews, but I was sorely disappointed. I found it to be talky, stagey, slow-paced, and overall, just plain dull. Bergman and Grant were excellent, but I did not feel this was one of Hitchcock's best. And as for the ""suspenseful climax"" and ending ... Cary Grant carries Ingrid Bergman down the stairs and out of the house right in front of all the assembled villains, then puts her into his car as Claude Rains whines? I was expecting a nail-biter. What I got was a sleep-inducer, and it ended with a whimper, not a bang.I give it three stars for the talent involved and for the cinematography."
1,Totally Disappointed,"The VHS product quality is so flimsy that I can't view it in my VCR. It keeps getting stuck. I will clean my VCR heads, but I really don't think that's the problem."
1,Nortorious,The DVD was damaged. The movie stopped at the most important moment of the movie. I returned the DVD. I was very disappointed.
1,How can anyone make something this bad?,"With great expectations, based upon the effusive reviews and the great actors in this movie, I started it but could endure only around ten minutes of it. Maybe it gets better, but I doubt it.It takes talent of a sort to take good actors and make a piece of crap like this! Any WWII spy movie should be compared to Shining Through and if it can't equal or surpass that a person investing his own money to make this monie should and will lose it."
5,A Classic!,"This is one of my top 5 movies of all time. Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman are amazing, as is Claude Rains. Definitely 5 out of 5 stars!"
5,What a great movie!,I love all of the Alfred Hitchcock movies! I also love Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman! What a great movie to add to my collection!
2,"Great Hichcock, Poor Bluray","It is assumed that people who purchase DVD and Bluray movies for their libraries are already familiar with the films. Therefore, suffice it to say that this film is a great Hitchcock masterpiece of suspence; one of my favorites.It was exciting news to me that Notorious was finally being released in Bluray, so naturally, I popped the disc into my player with great anticipation. What appeared on my 55 inch plasma screen was a sheer disappointment. What I viewed was substancial grain, lack of clarity and a poor gray-scale. Most of my standard DVD discs played on a Bluray player look much better than this.Unless the producers of this disc can significantly do better, they shouldn't bother to go the Bluray route. Notorious deserves better."
1,Don't waste your time,I was totally disappointed in this movie. It moves so slow and there is no suspense. I was expecting much better. I would not waste my time watching it.
1,What a let down,and by all people . . . Hitchcock. This was nothing more than a Hollywood dramatization of WWII's events. Nazi oppression and Jewish victimization has been immortalized in such movies like this and Schindler's List that few facts even remain in some people's minds. Instead people get their history from half fact and half Hollywood fairytale from movies like this. It has led to an obsession of sorts with germans and hitlet and german jews and the holocaust . . . read a book sold on here called the Holocaust Industry. . . this movie is definitely explained in that book. Hitchcock movies take you away from the world's ills and made movie watching a treat. But not here. And of all accomplices . . . Carey Grant. Sad.
3,"Great Supplements, Average Picture Quality","As usual, Criterion has gone all out in producing a fine DVD of a great classic. I have to say however, that I was very disappointed in the picture quality. Overall, Criterion has no rival when it comes to producing the finest picture imaginable.Unfortunately, I have to give the nod to Anchor Bay's DVD of ""Notorious"". It was nearly flawless, whereas the Criterion version is somewhat grainy in parts and just does not match the Anchor Bay version. Hopefully, ""Rebecca"" and ""Spellbound"" will have the usual Criterion clarity."
3,Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman...nuff said.,Not a bad movie for Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman film buffs. It was probably a lot better in the day.
3,For your collection,"A film for your collection. I would not say it's a great film. I would say it has moments of greatness and the acting is excellent. However, it is a dated movie that for younger folks may not hold up well. The ending is classic and makes the story worth following!"
4,a very sexy Ingrid Bergman,Another Hitchcock classic. A romantic thriller featuring a very sexy Ingrid Bergman and always handsome Cary Grant. Bergman is outstanding as a party girl turned World War II spy in Brazil. Grant hates himself for falling in love with her. A suspensful movie with much deceit and romance. The DVD image is sharp and clear.
4,Very Good,"Notorious is both a love story and a thriller: the story of Alicia Huberman (Ingrid Bergman), a woman of a ""certain reputation"" and daughter of a convicted Nazi traitor, who's recruited by T.R. Devlin (Cary Grant) to serve as a spy in Brazil. Despite the strong feelings that arise between Huberman and Devlin (and what a gorgeous couple Bergman and Grant make), she gets more and more involved with the man she's supposed to spy--a relationship that threatens not only Alicia's relationship with Devlin, but also her life. The end is suspenseful, and the film is set in a very believable (although fake) Rio de Janeiro."
2,Easy to read but not enough fine print,"This book was too much of an overview for me. I don't suggest it to someone who has logged more than 10 hours for a theatre. However, good basics ideas so try it if you are a fresh newcomer."
5,"Where did this band come from, they rock!","First off I would like to say I agree with the other two reviews, this cd kicks ass! I actually bought this CD last July after hearing it at a friends house, and just like the other reviewer stated, it's been in my cd changer ever since too. It's one of those CD's that seem to get better ever time you listen to it. The music reminds me of old Aerosmith, mixed with the Stray Cats, with some Jerry Lee Lewis added just for fun. All I can say is that I love the disc, and if there were more bands on the radio that sounded like these guys, radio would be a safer place! As I stated in my title, I am not sure where this band came from, or how long they been playing, but the cd rocks, and my copy isn't for sale!"
5,Another great live album.,"From the moment I put it in the cd player untill the time I pulled the 2nd cd from, it rocked and it rocked HARD! Excellent sound quality,song lineup and the same amazing Iron Maiden energy! What more can I say? A must for the Maiden fan!"
4,A good live production,"You got to have this if you're a real Maiden fan. It's a great live production with the main hits and some others like Heaven Can Wait etc. Of course, it can't compare with Live After Death..but then again what can?"
3,Oh how the mighty have fallen,"Now, don't kill me! I am a HUGE Maiden fan but this is pretty bad, I'm not going to lie. Okay, I take that back. Bruce is pretty bad to the point where it's hard for me to judge the rest of the band because he either is out of breath, can't get up quite as high or doesn't care (considering this is right before he split from the band).Iron Maiden has been known to put out quite an amount of live albums, which is probably what makes this one so glaring because it is definitely not on par with any of the others. If you really want to hear Maiden in their element, get Live After Death or if you don't mind the newer stuff Death on the Road is pretty good too."
2,Dickinson ruined this concert,"When this was released in 93, There were already 3 live Maiden albums. Saying that, There really was no need for this concert to be released [A real live one and A real dead one were released very shortly before this one!]. Bruce Dickinson was on his way out of the band when this concert took place which can probably explain why he sounds so laughably bad at times on this cd. As always, The band plays its music well, But, No matter how good the music sounds on this cd, It's almost always marred by Dickinson's surprisingly weak vocals. A few songs [''The number of the beast'', ''Bring your daughter to the slaughter'', and ''Be quick or be dead''] work out pretty decent, But to put it clearly, Bruce Dickinson ruined this concert with what is arguably his worst performance ever recorded. This cd is much too overpriced and is not even worth the $20-$25 it takes to get this cd. If you wanna hear Maiden live, Buy live after death instead."
4,"GOOD, BUT NOT GREAT!","I BOUGHT THE ALBUM FOR CLIFF EBERHARDT'S SONG, ""MY FATHER'S SHOES."" THE ALBUM IS WORTH THAT SONG ALONE AND YOU CAN NOT GET THIS SONG ANYWHERE ELSE. KRISTEN'S HALL'S ""IN THE COUNTRY"" IS ALSO TERRIFIC. THAT SONG IS ALSO DIFFICULT TO FIND. IT IS ON HER ""FACT AND FICTION"" CD, WHICH IS OUT OF PRINT.THESE TWO SONGS ALONE, WARRANT A RATING OF FOUR, ON THIS OTHERWISE PLEASANT, BUT NOW AWESOME COLLECTION."
4,changing habits,"I recently purchased ""Changing Habits"" by Debbie Macomber from Amazon..I really enjoyed thebook. It was an easy/fast read..It was a large print home library edition which made it easyto read at night if your lighting is not the greatest. I would definetly recommend this bookand also the service from Amazon. I rec. it a few days before the delivery date."
4,Emerging Creation,"Debbie Macomber presents an honest look at the lives of three young women who discover that there are many ways to ""serve God"". Without resorting to the all too common Church bashing attitude, ""Changing Habits"" shows the complex interaction of individuals, family and the world in shaping institutions and the people working within them. Although a bit predictable, this book does an excellent job of portraying the evolution of the Catholic Church and the efforts of people to remain faithful to themselves and to the truth in an ever changing world."
3,Credit where it is due,I'm not a Macomber fan. I've never liked her shmaltzy style or poorly researched story backgrounds.I want to give credit where it is due when I find the opportunity.Ms. Macomber did a very fine job of exploring the issues which Nuns can confront and which can force them to reevaluate the decision to continue with that life. I felt that she was able to present an unbiased view of the three women in this story revealing the way that each resolved those issues.Good job.
3,Ending falls short.,"Heard the taped version of CHANGING HABITS by Debbie Macomber . . . it is the story of two women who enter the convent, then both leave it for various reasons . . . their respectivetales were interesting, and I enjoyed reading about both of them--until the ending . . . Macomber seems to have gotten tired of writing at that point in time and fast forwards thingsto a reunion of all the sisterhood members . . . I wanted to know more about what happened to the two women; instead, the last 30 years of their lives were condensed into a few minutes (pages, I imagine, if you're reading) at the end . . . Trini Alvarado--an actress I've admired but who just hasn't been in that many films to suit my taste--did an excellent job of narration."
3,Same shortfalls as Cast Away,"I agree with the positive things that the other reviewers said about this book. However, this book left me feeling the same way as I did at the end of Cast Away. There just wasn't enough time spent describing how the sisters assimulated into secular life. 30 years were wrapped up in a chapter or two.I gave this book 3 stars because while it was good while it lasted at the end I felt down. I won't keep this one in my library to read over again."
1,Changing Habits,I was under the impression that this was a christian novel... not... way to sensual for good teens to read. Very disapointed in this author.
1,Never received book,I NEVER RECEIVED THE BOOK....I AM DISAPPOINTED WITH YOUR FEED BACK ON THIS ISSUE. AS AN AMAZON MEMBER I HAVE HAD NO RESPONCE TO THE FACT IT NEVER ARRIVED.
2,Unfunky Woo,"As a fan of Bernie Worrell's work with P-Funk, Bill Laswell projects and Talking Heads, I was interested in this Bernie Worrell solo project. Lots of the folks you'd expect participated: Laswell is co-producer and all over the place, Fred Wesley, Buckethead, Umar Bin Hassan. But frankly it didn't do much for me. Much of it seems to be Bernie's attempt at classical/""serious"" music. Which is fine by me, but I did not find it compelling in that genre either. For tracks as long as these (4 of 7 are over 6 minutes, two of those are respectively 9:48 and 14:43), you'd better have more thematic development or one heck of a good vamp going. Neither is the case here. I'll give it two stars for ambition, and concede that it's better to aim high and miss than aim low and hit the target."
4,Very good... but with some unseemly omissions.,"I would happily agree with most other reviewers; this is one of the best texts that a reader will find on the modern middle east. That said (and I did not notice this the first time through the book), the author does not deign to address many of the atrocities that have happened in the region. For example, the whole of the Armenian Genocide (the deaths of 1.5 million people) is reduced to 3 sentences in the opening remarks of a section. The Shelling of Hama, the Iran-Iraq war, the invasion of Kuwait, and Sabra and Chatila are also glazed over in roughly as much detail."
4,Based In Fact And Experience,"I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. George in a closed setting with several colleagues. He obviously possessed an inner rectitude and calm that is absent in many of our frenzied lives. Please disregard the callous and stupid comments of R. Sequin aka ""drrhs108 with respect to Mr. George's character and to the quality of the writing. The work is factual and the characters are all real participants in the events portrayed. The writing style reflects the character of the author and is calm, steady and objective. These are essential traits for an ambassador to play successfully on the world stage for so many years. The work is sensitive, stays on topic and makes a really good read."
2,Disappointed,"I just watched this with my 2 1/2 year old son last night and I was a bit disappointed. We usually love Bob the Builder, but this one had some language in it that I felt was not up to par with other Bob episodes. The character of ""Banger"", for example, made some crude remarks that could have been left out. For a Christmas movie, I would not recommend it. It does very little to promote Christmas but rather promotes rock star lifestyle and language. I may be overly sensitive, but I thought I'd share this in case there are other parents out there concerned about it."
2,Disappointing,"So, what's the ""blonde myth""? What are its ""roots"" in ""our culture""? Don't ask Natalia Ilyin; she doesn't know or care. This book is straight-up memoir, with occasional citation-free references to ancient mythology and pop psychology. Most chapters center around listing characteristics of blonde archetypes (eg., the innocent, the warm, the ""crazy""), and when Ilyin gives real-world examples, it's to describe how various celebrities don't quite fit. Well, obviously; women are people, not archetypes, but where did these archetypes come from, and why do they persevere? The author never gets there. In fact, Blonde Like Me rarely gets past the word Go on any idea and repeatedly assumes all its readers are straight, cis, and marriage-minded. Race is only discussed on one page, and with a title like that, this seems particularly irresponsible."
2,A little scattered,"I really wanted to love this book and sadly that was not the case. I am fan of non-fiction and though this book has great bones- the writing is a bit scattered making it difficult to focus on the points being made in each section. The best parts of the book are the authors personal reflections about her own blondness which was a tad disappointing to me since I had hoped the book would be a touch more academic in feel. Overall an interesting book and sparked good conversation at our book club, but not something I would unequivocally recommend."
3,Humorous,"The author discusses different ""types"" of blondes, the trophy blonde, innocent blonde, etc in a funny way. It was an easy read, I read it all in one sitting. There's nothing too academic here. She also tells us about how she goes blonde and blonder each summer, then gets a haircolor kit from the store and goes dark again. Could have been longer but enjoyable"
3,"from a naturally blonde, 25-year-old reader","This book is good for entertainment; in fact, it's a page-turner. It's like a really long ""Mademoiselle"" article. I wasn't sure who her intended audience for this book was--I don't see _BLM_ as scholarly. Also, I think it's a little ignorant to say that natural blondes are as rare as albinos. My relatives always told me when I was a child that my hair would turn brown in my teens. I'll be 26 in October, and my hair is still the same color it always was. At the beginning, Ilyin talks about her cyclical ritual with getting highlights and then ""double-processing"" and then dyeing it brown again. I wonder, why doesn't she just stay blonde all the time if that's what she likes? Still, I recommend it: I would put it in the same category with humorous books by Maryln Schwartz like _A Southern Belle Primer_ and _New Times in the Old South_."
5,"Myth, Life, and Hair","My wife's blonde. My 57 year-old mother just dyed her once-brunette Italian coif blonde. I needed to read this book, and so do you. Ilyin covers not only fashion and consumer culture, she dips into myth, symbolism, history, and gender. What made this enjoyable was the spin placed on her personal anecdotes. She looks back with a critical eye and, it's an eye capable of seeing beneath the surface. Taking on popular culture, religion, and (of course) hair coloring, Ilyin shows us that appearances can sometimes be deceiving. And most of the time, they simply are."
2,a misleading title...,"I got this book for Christmas off of my wishlist. I had mistakenly assumed that it was a survey of blonde myth in culture, in which I would have been interested in reading. Unfortunately, this book is really a collection of stories about the author's life with a little myth interwoven. I'm extremely disappointed and couldn't even finish it. The title should not say ""Roots of Blonde Myth in Our Culture"", it should state: ""Personal Stories that Have Little to Do With Culture""And another thing: where in the world is the INDEX? How can the author use direct quotes or paraphasing and not site anything??? Maybe I would want to read a little more about the books or people she talks about - oh wait, I can't, because she apparently didn't have any other sources. When I was getting my English degree, I was taught that not siting any sources was called plagiarism. I think that's the thing that bothered me most about this book."
2,Expected more form AA....,"The Enterprise line should have been soooo much better. If done correctly AA would still be making these figures and would be able to give us the rest of the crew. Likeness is good [as they were scanned...but still not dead on], articulation is there but block by the rubber pants that is covering the lower half of the figures. This rubber does not pose well, nor do the figures really sit well either. Once again figures will not always stand on there own [no peg holes or stands to help keep this inflexible guy on his toes]."
3,Poorly Painted,"I am disapointed in the quality of the uniform blue. It rubs off easily and leaves the toy looking old and worn out. If you are only planning to keep it for show inside the box it does not dissapoint, however I chose to remove mine and pose it with the weapon and the blue rubbed off just doing that. I have written a complaint note to Assylum but thus far have not gotten a response."
4,Great resource for those living in south central Pennsylvania,"I do a lot of travelling in the Harrisburg, Pennsylvania area. This atlas is a great resource for me.Do I have a meeting in Lancaster that I have to attend? This map helps me get there. Am I interested in a Cajun restaurant in Columbia? This atlas gives me what I need to get there.Fall can be pretty great here, in terms of leaves. This atlas helps me to plan a weekend drive to see leaves without running into a lot of traffic. Leisure is important here, and the atlas allows me to plot out a route to appreciate the changing seasonal colors.This week, I have to go to a meeting in Lancaster, PA. This map gives me more confidence than mapquest.com. I can look at an atlas and figure out how to get where I need to go. . . .So, a good resource for me."
2,Looks good only from a distance! Too expensive,"The desk/cart looks good from a distance - however it is made of compressed cardboard with wood-look PAPER covering. The entire piece is held together with glue - I did substitute Gorilla wood glue. MOST of the screws lined up but not all. Drawers are 1/4"" cardboard - only the paper on the corners and glue holds the drawer fronts on! So don't put anything heavy in them. I chose this style because of the more substantial legs but they are really folded 1/4"" cardboard just like the drawers with particle board inserted for the casters. Not happy for the price."
5,Among the best math books I've ever read,"I am not an analyst, but this book is fun to read.This book does something that few others textbooks accomplish - it tells an interesting and compelling story. I didn't really understand measure until reading this book, which does a great job of laying out the various competing ideas of the time and how they evolved into the current notion.Further - and perhaps most important for a math book - is that the proofs are very clear and complete. It's true that many important concepts are left as exercises, but those that are covered in the text are covered well. In contrast, I have suffered too many math texts that attempt to cover every important result but with only short, uninformative proofs (e.g. ""Proof: By Radon-Nikodym and Corollary 2 of Theorem 5 QED"")."
1,Disgusting and narcissistic,"Geez! I thought Christian Thielemann was the most obnoxious ""podium legend"" before the public these days, but Rattle has him beat. Nonsenical tempo changes, arbitrary and ineffective agogic accents, poor orchestra playing, engineering that filters out every high frequency over 10000 hz. - - this one has it all. A great party record for those of us steeped in the orthodox Mahler tradition.The only operative concept here is ""I am Sir Simon, and this is _my_ Resurrection Symphony.Find another line of work, you arrogant dork!"
5,Awesome Awesome Awesome,"I loved this game, but I can play it anymore since it doesn't run on macs.I know I'm 15, but I LOVE this game. It's so much fun."
5,"Lovely Earrings, and fast shipping!","I bought these to match a pendant that had already been given to me. The earrings are well made, light and very pretty! Also, I recieved the items before the estimated date, and that always makes me happy~ I would buy from them again."
5,A Great Buy!,"I wasn't sure what I was expecting, but I took a risk, I thought the silver wasn't going to be sturdy but the earrings are super sturdy and well-made. They're also very light, lighter than I expected but they add a great finishing touch to any outfit. A great buy!"
5,Celtic Knot Hoops,These Celtic Knot Hoop Dangle Earrings arrived before Christmas. I gave them to my two daughters who like to collect Celtic Jewelry. They both loved them. They are unusual and very elegant. They were also the size I expected them to be. Great product!
5,well-made celtic earrings,I was pleased how quickly the earrings arrived and with the quality of the earrings.
5,"Excellent read for at least some, hopefully all","I picked this book up randomly at the library between classes. I only got about half way through before I had to leave but I made sure to tuck it away and finish it later that night. Excellent read for one sitting. Even if the author doesn't accurately present the true intentions and motivations behind Babbage and Turing's breakthroughs, he still manages to establish that computer science was an evolution of thought not some spontaneous stroke of brilliance. By the end of the book you feel a little starved for information but that is what makes this book such an excellent primer for additional reading on a number of subjects. This book really is a primer, don't read it if you have PHDs in history and computer science. I don't want to see Dr. whats his face giving this book half a star. It's a good book period."
1,save your money,I was looking for a pet tag that reflected and was glow-in-the-dark.I bought this because of the price. Now I wish I hadn't purchased it. It is flimsy and I can't see how it can reflect! Don't buy this one!
1,Reflect ive id tag,"The tags didnt do what it said, it didnt reflect at night & its not water proof & when I contacted the company about the tags all I got was im sorry, they could have at least offered 2 replace it just in case had a defect, I wasnt please!"
3,Caramel Goodness,"If you love Aero bars, then you've got to try them with the added bonus of caramel. Eat 'em when you get 'em however, because they don't keep all that well. After several weeks the flavor is altered quite a bit."
1,Church's very premise is self-contradictory.,"I am the author of The Liberal Contradiction, and Mr. Church's very title is a classic example of that phenomenon. His complaint is that the Far Right claims God is on their side, yet his answer is to make precisely the same claim for the Left. He claims to be concerned about the Right's injection of religion into politics, but then says that a ""proper"" understanding of Chrisitianity justifies his own politics. With such a contradictory premise, Mr. Church unwittingly offers himself as an example of th"
1,Civil Religion all the way,"Church is funny! As a Christian I have to ask why do I want to recover the bible, the flag or the family. Each of these are nothing more than another form of idolatry when placed within the conflicts of Church and his straw enemies. This is a bad book that needs to be read to see how far Unitarians will go to pretend to be religious in the name of democracy. Hey Church, join a church and abandon the social club of Unitarianism and you might be able to experience something more than a civil religion of the state."
5,More Food that Really Schmecks (and Food that Really Shmecks,"The recipes in More Food that Really Schmecks are interesting, easy, use ingredients that many of us have on hand and above all, yield food that everyone loves. This is one of my ""desert island"" cookbooks. Among the 400+ in my collection, this is one of the top five! (Likewise Food that Schmecks, the first in the series.) I also love the little stories about Edna's mother and friends. There is a strong influence from old order Mennonites (similar to the Amish in the US.)"
5,Awsome Book!,"I picked this book up from a local Chapters because I was looking for something to help me out at work (I repair PCs). Wow, this book is thick and has a ton of information on understandin just what is going on inside the PC. Included on the CD-ROM are a couple of utilities that I have used to help me understand what is going wrong with PCs and what is and what isn't being installed.The history of the PC was really useful and it helped me to understand what was going on - especially when I get an old '486."
2,Although interesting the book is misrepresented.,"This book is NOT everything you need to interface your PC with outside devices. Like most of Myke Predko's books it is full of filler material and misrepresented. It does contain lots of interesting information about computer interfacing, but no useful information to get you started on your own. I am very dissapointed with Predko's books and feel that he writes to sell books and not primarily to educate and inform."
3,Fascinating,"The Guarneri's cellist has now retired - the quartet is in a new phase and I'm sure they'll continue to evolve, in spite of a recent savage review in Strad. They're one of our great quartets, and I recommend any of their recordings.It's a very interesting video and I recommend it, but if its really representative of their lives together, I pity these guys. They were together for 35+ years, and it appears to have been one long argument, due to communication mistakes that they just kept making over and over without ever trying something different, judging by the film. Without commenting on David Solley's musicianship, I think the other three might have been happier with another cellist, one closer to them in age, experience, and communication style."
3,Dull,"This is a dull old (1989) documentary. The film makers obviously didn't have any interesting idea to build the film around: it's all rather loose, wordy but unedifying, mouldering, totally lacking in incisiveness. On the positive side, there's a good amount of music here, so if you're a fan of this group, you will probably like the film somewhat, simply because of the opportunity to see the guys move around, say something, and play music. Another thing that I found annoying was that they were constantly out of tune."
5,"If you like Doc Watson, check this guy out","A real winner. Bluesy, country-flavored truegrass, with swell picking all around. Don Rigsby produced the album, and plays fiddle and mandolin, while Phil Ledbetter provides some mighty sweet dobro licks throughout. Most of all, though, this album features the fince, fine vocals of Fuller himself, an ex-miner from Kentucky, who devoted himself to music fulltime after a mining accident sidelined him in the '80s. I ain't complaining; this is precisely the kind of album that I really love: musically rich, and quite heartfelt. Recommended!!"
5,YOU HAVE TO GIVE HER CREDIT,"This album is actually one of the best albums that I have heard from a female vocalist in a long time. Even though this CD is an independent production, I believe the quality of the album is better than most of the major record label productions on the market. Ledisi's ability to intertwine Jazz, Funk, and Traditional R&B; Flavor into her music is awesome. Other emerging vocalists should definitely study her. Her vocal style and her ability to scat is amazing! Maybe by studying her vocal style, Real Soul music from Real Female Singers with Real Talent will again become the trend. On this CD, you get some of everything! The stand out tracks on this album include:Free Again In My Life Papa Loved To Love Me Take Time Coffee Hotel My Prayers"
2,still yawning...,"Ledisi is less than average...there, it had to be said! if hating on this album is wrong, then i'ma be wrong. being a good poet doesn't always equate to being a good recording artist. she is definitely different than anything else being offered out there now, and i'll always give an artist props for originality, but i'm just jaded and expect more for my money. this just doesn't move me, sorry."
4,Still jammin' to it...,"Ledisi - Soulsinger (2000)Word has it that this album is to be rereleased this year on Tommy Boy Records. If this is true, then I'm glad that she's getting a second chance. Soulsinger is filled with Ledisi's ability to mix little spoken word with jazz, R&B, and soul. She puts her all in every performance, as evidenced in ""Take Time"" and ""Coffee"". She has the voice of a throaty Southern gospel choir singer and she truly delivers. It's too bad that some of these songs have uninspired lyricism like in ""Groove On"", a song about her wanting a one-night stand. Also, she tends to sing so hard that she gets off-key, which is a problem throughout the album. But it's hard to find powerful singers like her these days and by listening to ""Free Again"" and the very revealing ""Poppa Loved to Love Me"", Ledisi should start getting props soon. -EJR"
4,"Pretty Good--Hard for me to get into this one, though!","I recommended Ledisi to a girlfriend a year ago, and she loves it. I just got it myself, and while this woman is definitely bad ... vocally, I can't get into her music or her beats. It is sad but many of the pop sensations out today have tight beats and really aren't that skilled vocally. But Ledisi definitely has a soul/jazz/blues feel to her that is unlike any other female vocalist out today. She surprises you with unique riffs and cool melodies. This is a refreshing addition to soul music today."
4,"Don't , get caught sleeping or,""Snoring,"" on this disc.","If you're like me and you had it up to HERE with so-called,""r&b"" music;then, you will like this body of work from Oakland singer Ledisi. This is the kind of disc one puts on when one gets tired of hearing the same 10 songs,""looped,"" over and over on the radio. It's the kind of disc one puts on when one wants to hear real musicians and singer blend to form a smooth sound that is new;yet,gives a nod to ""old school"" sounds like,ooh,I don't know,---jazz quartets and soul(Check out,Take Time,to hear what I'm writing about).I like her sense of humor with the last track;but,some might not,""get it."" Never the less, do like I did and buy and support someone who along with her tight band actually took time to create a body of work to,""Groove On."""
4,"Don't ,""sleep,"" on this album.","If you're like me and you had it up to HERE with so-called,""r&b"" music;then, you will like this body of work from Oakland singer Ledisi.

It's the kind of disc one puts on when one wants to hear real musicians and singer blend to form a smooth sound that is new;yet,gives a nod to ""old school"" sounds like,ooh,I don't know,---jazz quartets and soul(Check out,Take Time,to hear what I'm writing about).I like her sense of humor with the last track;but,some might not,""get it."" Never the less, do like I did and buy and support someone who along with her tight band actually took time to create a body of work to,""Groove On."""
5,Serious Soul Singer,"I really enjoyed this CD. For persons starved for real music with soul and no fillers, this is a great choice. As a singer myself, I know how hard it must have been to complete this work without major label backing. My favorite song is ""Free Again"". Pick up a copy and if possible check her out live. Most of all keep supporting her music. She's a true artist."
5,"Mind numbing, body tingling music....","When my friend came up to me ranting and raving about a female vocalist she dubbed a ""must see"" I didn't hesitate to check out her show in Sacramento. I can safely say I was blown away. Ledisi easily transports you to a Groove Universe with her heavenly voice and stimulating lyrics. Even if you don't dance, you won't be able to resist doing a little chair boogie when she really gets going. Backed up by some incredibly talented musicians, Ledisi and her band seem too good to be true. From the time I walked in until the end of the show my mouth hung open in awe and my bootie was shakin' as though it had a mind of its own!"
4,5% Bump in MPG,"This filter was a little hard to install -- I gave up and watched a master mechanic have a hard time getting the thing into my 98 Outback Wagon. I have noticed a nice 5% bump in mileage. This product requires maintenance instead of replacement, so buy the K&N filter care kit."
3,does not fit 1999 Subaru Legacy 2.2l,"33-2232 does not fit my 99 Legacy 2.2l, trying to fit this it is too small by about 2 inches on either side.should have taken some measurements before i ordered this over the 2154 which is a longer filter.the amazon part checker wrongly stated that this fits my ""1999 Subaru LegacyEngine: 2.2L H4 Gas SOHC Distributorless Naturally Aspirated SFI Electronic FI MFITrim: L""rating a 3 but only because of the amazon mistake, nothing to do with the performance of the filter."
3,Book review,"The book had A LOT of notes written all over. It is a little difficult to read. There is also a lot of highlighting,but that is a little more tolerable to read through."
3,Order received,"At last, my niece got the book before Christmas. She was very thankful as this could help her a lot in her studies."
4,Creative Land,"Although written in an overly dry and tedious manner Creative Land is an informative and interesting take on culture in Papua New Guinea (specifically the Reite People. I would have known this from the copy I ordered, however, it never arrived. Never shopping on Amazon again."
2,Attorney biased,"If you are less afraid of legal documents than most people and like to do some things on your own, this book is not as useful as are other books, e.g. Dennis Clifford, ""Estate Planning Basics"". If you are somewhat afraid of legal documents, this book will probably make you more afraid. Although they talk about people being able to create some of their own documents (with software programs, etc,) they really think that such people are in a grave danger zone and ought to go to an attorney. In other words, I think that they are attorney biased. I think if one were to ask them about going to the toilet,they would probably say that you better ask an attorney."
3,Didnt meet my needs but a good product as intended Im sure,"out of date, but I guess it was current at the time. The title ""new rules"" was misleading since I didn't know the publication date. JK Lasser Products are always superb and thorough. However the special needs trust, which is why I bought it, just said to consult my lawyer, and gave no examples. I was disappointed."
5,phone skeptic,"This phone has surpassed all of my expectations. It has incredible reception and awsome distance. I have heard a lot of other 2.4GHZ phones and this is by far the best one that I have ever bought. I bought this one for my girlfriend and am going to buy one for myself. I recomend it to anyone. The only down side to this phone is that some of the features are a little hard to operate, but once you get used to it there's nothing but smooth sailing."
2,"What a BUMMER! ""White noise"" static won't go away.","I too am getting the ""white noise"" static that others have talked about here. I tryed doing the technique Siemens recommends to make it go away (de-register/power down/re-register), but it's not fixing the problem. There is nothing in my house that should be interferring with the phone. I've tryed two Gigasets now with the same problem. I've since tryed a Panasonic 2.4GHz phone in my house and had no problem with static at all. Obviously, there's a flaw with the Siemens phones. Siemens customer service says there's nothing else they can do about it. That's very disappointing. I really wanted to use this phone because of the expandibility, but the ""white noise"" static is just too annoying, and apparently, not fixable."
5,Reception problem solved,"Another reviewer wrote ""Excellent Phone! Here's how to solve reception"" describing the proper method of reseting this phone and it's extensions. When I encountered reception prolems that were not solved by resetting I called Seimens 800 number. Their imediate response was that the trouble was in the base unit and that they would replace it. Shipping to take 4-5 buisness days actually took only the week-end. Return shipping lable for the defective unit was included. My system now works great, clear reception and I can use it beyond my property line, some 600 feet from the base. You can't ask for better service and I can now enjoy features on my home/office phone that were only available on my cell phone before. Buy it, you'll love it."
2,Class action lawsuit worthy,My fiancee bought this for me a year and 1/2 ago for my home office. Too bad we invested a few hundred dollars in extra handsets with most of them sounding underwater.How depressing!
2,Interference problems,"The reception on this phone was very poor from the day I bought it. There was a continuous sound of static in the background when I used it in the exact location from where my 900 Mhz phone works fine. After the service staff couldn't help me, I returned the product"
1,Don't waste your money on this one,"I bought 1 and thought it was defective, so I went back and got another one. It does the same thing as the first one, about once every 5 or 6 calls the other person complains of this echoing. In other words they can only hear every other word I say. I called their tech support, they instructed me to unplug it for 10 minutes to reset it. I found this odd because it is only 2 days old and wouldn't it being fresh out of the box count as leaving it unplugged for 10 minutes. So if I have to unplug it every 2 days for 10 minutes to reset it, it must be junk.If I could give it 0 stars I would, but I have to give it 1. At least it looks cool."
1,Only good for a short time with too many features,"I bought this phone about 17 months ago. Since then the phone was repaired once, batteries were changed at least four times. (although they are rechargeables.) The batteries don't last for an entire day. The features of the phone are nice but for most users useless, unless you have a mansion where you want to use several cordless phones. If you want a phone for comfortable everyday use, DON'T BUY THIS PHONE."
2,"Keep the headset, throw away the base","If you haven't noticed this phone as a whole [...stinks], however the headset is good and works well with the working base stations. So get this one, and chunk the base, and you have a cheap replacement head set. Oh be sure to replace the NiCd batteries with NiMH ones. The same headset alone costs $149, this is the same one but only cost $49.99."
1,I cannot walk next door!,I have had analog phones reach farther. I cannot walk next door without this thing breaking up. I would hold out for 4.8 GHz or whatever comes out next.
2,"Elegant idea, but too complicated to use","I thought this would be the perfect phone. Unfortunately, it had two drawbacks, one minor and one major. The minor inconvenience is that this phone can't be wall mounted. (I wanted it for the kitchen wall.) But more dissapointing was the difficulty of use. The soft menus are really annoying, and I missed some of the easily accessible features that my old phone had. I returned the phone in favor of a more straightforward design from AT&T."
1,Siemens 2415 is unreliable,"Siemens has had to replace my new 2415 twice (so far). The first phone dropped calls and the party on the other end of the line constantly complained of static. On the second phone, the handset display quit working within 5 days. Product replacements are rebuilt units, and customer support tells met that Siemens no longer manufactures this unit and cannot deliver a new one, and they refuse to refund my purchase (FYI-the phone was not purchased at Amazon)."
1,Unsatisfied with product,The reception on this phone has been worse than my 900 Mhz phone. Both handsets exhibited the same problem with the reception going in and out.
5,It works!,"Got a handspring Treo 90 and bought the SanDisk 128MB Secure Digital Memory card the next day. Had to update the Treo with an update from Handspring before using it, but it was no problem. In genral it is awesome. Loading data (like a 12MB dictionary from Peanutpress or whatever they are called these days) is slow, but I think that has to do with Flash in general and not necessarily the SanDisk card. I have also loaded a ton of jpegs on it and it works like a champ. I highly recommend this memory card."
3,"When it worked, it was fine.","I got a really great deal on a 128mb SanDisk SmartCard through Amazon. However, one day it was no longer recognized by my Olympus camera. It could not be reformatted either. It was only about a year old, so I received a new card quickly from SanDisk. Now a year later-- same thing has happened. The card has a five year warranty HOWEVER, I called the manufacturer who told me they no long make this product and there are no replacements available for them to send me, so in other words, I am OUT OF LUCK. They offered to send me another product (not for the camera, but just something else of the same value). That was a nice gesture, but I really didn't need anything else. Well, I guess you get what you pay for. If you're going to buy one of these cards, be aware they are no longer being replaced by SanDisk, so the 5 year warranty is basically useless."
1,Bad disks,I have ordered and returned 2 of these for use with a new e310 toshiba palm pc.1. The first came in and said it was only 310Kb2. The 2nd would only copy about 36Mb of files and then crach my computer. Also every time I put it in the e310 it would ask to format it. !!! spent 2 days talking to Toshiba ans sandisk. Of course each say its the other whats new!!!
1,NOT COMPATABLE with Toshiba e310!,"I just got off the line with Toshiba. The Sandisk SD's are NOT compatable with their Pocket PC's. I bought three of the 128 MB's at once (for backups and data storage) and two have died so far. Sandisk did not know of this (they do now) but Toshiba DID and has NO warnings up on their Web site! Man am I ticked! The 128's will work for a while, start to fail, then hard fail on the Pocket PC (won't even recognize it). Toshiba suggested I buy a Toshiba SD instead (or a Dilken to be fair). Toshiba, I love the e310, but this is a poor way to treat customers."
1,Does not work with Sharp Zaurus,"DO NOT buy this if you want to use it with a Sharp Zaurus -- if you check the Zaurus newsgroups, you'll find that this card does not work with that great little PDA. It will mount once, then if you turn the machine off or eject the card it will never be mountable again. It's not clear if this is a problem with the SD card or the Zaurus, but it is clear you should use a different brand..."
1,sloooooow RMAs,"Bought one of these and it was defective.After calling Sandisk and spending 15 minutes giving all the info to some representative in FLA, was told they would be back to me in 3-4 days. After hearing nothing from them for about 14 days (even with another phone call), I finally got an email from their customer service. Too late, as I dumped this card at a loss and went with Lexar- a company whose memory has held up well for me. As far as Sandisk goes- cheap prices, but you end up paying later if you ever need support."
2,Does not work with Toshiba E310,I had to reset my device at least 10 times and sometimes I needed a hard reset and lose all valuable data.
1,Not compatible with Toshiba E740,"I bought the card because it said that it is compatible with PDA.I first had some troubles with transfer large files. Then had trouble with backup(back-up) of the Toshiba E740 pocket PC.After chatting with Toshiba online support, suggesting that I check the compatibility, I went to the Sandisk's website, and then found out that the SD 128 MB (619659015947/B000068CS0)doesn't compatible with Toshiba product. What a problem. Hope that help."
2,Not fully compatible with Audiovox PDA,"After receiving an error message when attempting backups and transfers of files over 3mb, I just gave up. Don't get this if you're using it with a Maestro."
1,Won't Work With Toshiba PDA according to Toshiba,"According to Toshiba technical support, this product will notwork with a Toshiba PDA. Therefore it is worthless to me. Ihave no idea as to why Amazon.com sells it under these circumstances. My recommendation would be to not buy it untilyou check with the manufacturer of the product where you plan to place it. Any SD manufacturer that has this poor of a relationship with a major device manafacturer should either repair the relationship or warn customers of problems. Avoidthis product unless you are sure it works with your device."
1,Error Failure,I have a Toshiba PDR-3300 Digital Camera which uses Secure Digital Memory. Because of the Sandisk 128MB's low price relative to its competitors I ordered it. On the 3rd picture I got a constant error failure on it. I returned it and ordered another one. It failed on the 10th picture. Returned it and ordered a Delkin Secure Digital Memeory Card. The Delkin has worked perfectly fine. Sandisk is selling theirs for about half the price of their competitors. Maybe there is a reason for this [low] price?
4,Works with the Casio EX-M1 -- with a catch,"I bought the SanDisk 128MB SD card for use with my new Casio EX-M1 digital camera. Popped it in and immediately ran into problems -- the camera wouldn't recognize that the card was empty after formatting.A quick call to Casio customer support solved the problem. The camera ships with the 1.00 firmware. In order to work with SanDisk's 128MB card, the 1.01 firmware is needed. After downloading the updated firmware, the card worked immediately.I'm now quite pleased with the card's performance. It works as advertised and the expansion from the camera's built-in 12 MB to 128 MB is quite dramatic. I can now store about 160 fine resolution pictures at full-size. What more can you ask of a memory card?"
5,Excellent,This memory card is great. Compare prices this one is less expensive and does just as good a job. I'd buy again.
4,Works great!,"I am using this memory card for my Panasonic digital camera. So far, it's working fine for me. Good price compared to other brands."
4,Sweet Ring!,"My husband got me this for our anniversary. I've been wanting a new band to go with a very nice engagement ring that he had made for me. This little band matches my engagement band very nicely! When it arrived we realized that we hadn't ordered correctly and the size was wrong. I emailed the company and they replaced with with the correct size. No problems. I was very happy with the company, Cool Styles! Of course it's hard to buy jewelry without seeing it and trying it on. This band is a little thinner (thickness wise) than I thought it should be. But for the price, it is a good deal."
5,Great dainty ring!,I was definitely happy with the 1/10 ct Diamond Anniversary band. It was a great compliment for the Engagement ring I got for my Wife. It has milgrained edges that matched perfectly beside her 18k white gold 1.2 ct Tiffany Legacy style ring and it was for $500 less than the band that was supposed to match it! Very happy
2,"great for hard floors, but not for carpets!","bought it because i love canister vacuums, but was not happy with it on my carpets. it does clean hard floors very easily though. but would not recommend this to anybody."
5,Don't belive the Criticism,I had a shark canister that lasted 7 years. It recently broke and I bought this model as a replacement. I was very impressed with the design and power. I was so impressed that for Mother's Day I bought one for my mom for Mother's Day. I made the mistake of reading the reviews AFTER I purchased the one for my mom. I was so upset at the reviews that bags were hard to come by that I canceled the order for my mom and went online to see if I would have a problem finding bags for my canister. I went right to Shark and placed an online order for two sets of bags on May 6th. I received the order today May 15!!!Please . . If you want a good vacuum at a reasonable price consider this model . . and don't believe everything you read!!!!!
4,It's no disappointment!,"This is my second Euro-Pro Shark canister vacuum, and for the quick jobs, especially my tile kitchen floor and hardwood stairs, I am not at all disappointed. It has a good deal of suction for a little machine. I'm not as impressed with it for carpeting. The only other con, is that the hook to hold the tool doesn't work, but the job it does outweighs this con."
1,"RUN DON""T WALK FROM THIS VACUUM!!!!!!!","Like the others who have experienced the incredible angst of owning this cute, compact vacuum, I add that there is no possible way to find replacement bags. When I bought the vacuum it was on sale (first red flag) at Best Buy. Going back to get replacement bags, they still had the item on their computer but no one knew nothin' about no replacement bags. The search, which continued through many stores and myriad websites led me to conclude I was sunk. Then my partner checked Amazon for their reviews and my fears were solidified, it was a dead end and I was left, pardon the pun, holding the bag. I implore Amazon not to sell these anymore, but it's still here. Oh well, we tried!"
5,Makes the travel easier,For my one-week-only trip (I circulated around Frankfurt and Wiesbaden) the book did it's job. The maps are great; the articles refresh your memory and help you look knowledgeable enough when talking to locals. Overall I think it makes the visit through this very hospitable country easier and even more entertaining.
4,as described,Product arrived as described. Fast service. Good quality. Very comfortable product.Product colors have not faded or bled. Would order again.
4,good,"if you want to buy this album because you've heard <access> and want more, don't expect too much. misjah has moved a bit from acid trance to techno for quite some time. this cd shows just that. it still has very hard beats, good build ups and tracks towards the end get quite ""acid."" basically... a very good cd. just not ""acid"" enought for me."
5,Guitar Legend doing what he does best,"Randy Rhoads is totally amazing on this album. Any music fan will enjoy this album, it shows this man's true talent. The Mr. Crowley solos are totally amazing, just hear how smoothly he plays these solos. The Tribute live version of all these songs are a lot better than the studio version. A piece of musical history and a must buy for any music fan."
1,Randy Roads is the worst guitarist ever!,"My friend David told me to check out this album for some tr00 guitar playing. I found the tape in a junkshop for 50 cents so I bought it without hesitation. Wow, was this bad or what! Total disappointment. The guitar playing was just the same boring shredding and overly-long solos again and again for an hour. Weak. Check out ""St. Anger"", ""All The Right Reasons"", ""Metal Machine Music"" or ""American Idiot"" for some facemelting solos from true fretboard masters!"
5,HRNDRIX WOULD ENVY,yes hendrix truly would envy randy in this album but I must say that randy dhoads has donr MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH better. I remember the first time i saw him in consert with ozzy (I say with ozzy cause i was him with riot before this) any how it was truly magical I was amazed by his talent I thougt he might have been possed by hendrix's ghoast the show made me want to learn every ozzy song written and play them on stage(I DID LOL)any how I've seen a lot of guitr playing i was at wood stock when hendrix played ive seen clapton play 2 times and wylde once and I will tell you RANDY RHOADS WAS THE GREATIST GUITARIST WHO EVER LIVED.(if u havent figured this out yet im not a kid DUH)
4,"O FORTUNA, INDEED!","The soul-stirring orchestral music that you hear in the beginning is the 'Opening' (O Fortuna) of ""Carmina Burana"" by Carl Orff. Below are the lyrics of the chorus in the Latin it is sung in with the English translation to the right of it. Knowing what happens to Randy makes the last sentence of this chorus haunting and utterly prophetic: ""since Fate strikes down the string man, everyone weep with me!"" Sors salutis Fate is against me et virtutis in health michi nunc contraria, and virtue, est affectus driven on et defectus and weighted down, semper in angaria. always enslaved. Hac in hora So at this hour sine mora without delay corde pulsum tangite; pluck the vibrating strings; quod per sortem since Fate sternit fortem, strikes down the string man, mecum omnes plangite! everyone weep with me!"
3,"Great tunes, terrible recording quality.",Great live stuff but the recording quality stinks. I went to a few of these tours and could have gotten better quality with an old stereo Sony Walkman recorder.
5,Great Buy,Purchased this album for a friend. He absolutely loves it. This was his favorite album and his last one got damaged so he couldn't play it.
5,Informing and inspirational in a world that abuses faith.,"This book was very inspiring and therapuetic in the area of healing and faith. Being a parent who child died from complications of cancer, a brain tumor, I found that along with the Word of God, I was released to believe that God heals whom He chooses because of His plan and not because of our lack of faith. I truly thank God for this book!"
4,Inspiational,I purchased this book for my brother who has been battling Hodgkins Disease for the past five years. My soul was blessed by the writings of Ron Dunn and my brother has said that only someone with personal experiences could have written such a dynamic book!
2,Horrid chemistry book,"Confusing explainations, and poor overall graphics and coloring. Not straight-forward enough. The beginning chemistry student may find it hard to understand. Gives too many extraneous details that do not help the reader understand the necessary concepts of basic chemistry.If you want a good introductory chemistry book, then I strongly recommend ""Foundations of College Chemistry"" (11th ed.), by Hein and Arena. It tells you what you need to know in an easy-to-comprehend style."
4,A must read.,"I have previously read all of Monique's earlier books,and ""Ties That Bind "" show how she has matured has a writer. Once I started to read the book, I could not stop, the story defintely kept me interested and wanting to find out what was going to happen next. Although Ms Gilmore-Scott is known for her romance books ""Ties That Bind"" shows that the author can go beyond that genre and write a book that is funny, sad, insightfull, and entertaining all at once. I highly recommend this book. Monique keep up the good work!!!!!!"
3,Good try....,With the scanning technology these figures actually turned out better than the film. Ron Perlman can be proud of his figure. Articulation is good and the large rubbery cloak & staff help the figure stand up [which is needed when it comes to AA figures].
2,Choking Hazard,"I dont know how the little freak did it, but my son got about 3/4 of this whole freaking action figure in his mouth, and choked on the stupid thing. i burned everything star trek in my house, and then broke into every house on my street and did the same to their stuff. dont buy this if you have moron children"
2,Review,"While the book does do a good job with a general overview of Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodox beliefs, it is not very extensive in regards to differentiating between Catholic and Orthodox beliefs. At times it makes you realize why many Protestants are confused with the Orthodox beliefs and lump them into the Catholics w/o the Pope box. Ok for Protestants looking to confirm their bias for their belief system, but don't expect to gain knowledge of the many differences between Catholics and Orthodox."
1,Strawman fallacies,Inaccurate information about Eastern Church's theology and practices. A good English text is _The Way: What Every Protestant Should Know About the Orthodox Church_ written by Clark Carlton. You can find in Amazon catalog. Very good at describing internal contradictions with protestantism from a protestant convert to Orthodoxy point of view.
1,Disappointing <sigh>,"These polemical, superficial works by our fundamentalist ""friends"" are a dime a dozen. Rather than truly inform, their aim is to prey upon ignorance. The comments provided by the previous reviewer remind me of why I left the Southern Baptist church and never looked back. Praying for the Lord's mercy on all..."
1,unscholarly hatchet job,"As said by other reviews, author makes numerous errors and misquotes source. Treatment of non-evangelical Christian is shoddy if not dishonest. This book is directed to stemming growing tide of evangelical converts to Orthodox Church where fullness of true faith in Christ is to be found. (Yes it's true - we worship Christ only and we don't sacrafice babies and drink their blood.)"
1,Attempted generic treatment fails,"As a Protestant, I take exception that this work does anything to promote ""Bible-centered"" Christianity while ""the other two guys"" don't. Statements like that are the height of ignorance and I'm sure this is the sort of writing intended to reinforce the brainwashing one learns in certain church environments. A word to my Catholic and Orthodox brothers and sisters... dime novels like this do not represent the mainstream Protestant point of view. Don't let the fundamentalists shade your view of us."
1,Author's bias gets in the way,"A poor treatment of non-fundamentalist Christianity. This is NOT a scholarly work. If that fact is understood and you share the author's narrow understanding of Christianity, then this book is for you."
4,good summary from Protestant viewpoint,"A good summary of the differences between Catholics, Orthodox and Protestants. Lots of fascinating historical background. Is definitely from the Protestant point of view but nothing wrong with that. Negative reviewers here just don't agree with Protestant viewpoint."
1,"Errors, material erroneously cited","Book lists supposed references, but when you dig a bit deeper it's apparent that name-dropping rather than accurate citations is at play. Perhaps if the writer's Pentecostal bias wasn't a factor then we'd have seen a more honest work."
5,glass bowl,"Purchased this gift for my mother-in-law for Christmas, received it just great, packed real well in the box. Came from Macy's and right on time. Very happy with the purchase and the delivery."
5,World War II Music and Words,"This is an excellent product, and my students get to hear the actual voices and sounds of some of the most important moments of WWII."
4,"Mandela, our Hero!","The ANC has given us utopia, a land without crime or violence where we can all live in a Godly nation who fears God and respects human life. Thank you so much Mr. De Klerk and Mr. Mandela For this utopia created by Black and White. It reminds me of the checkerboard squares’ inside our local satanic freemason shrine. Thanks to the slumber of ‘Christians’ and our godless freemason, New World Order constitution we can all hold hands and imagine we are living in what the ANC promised the citizens of S.A. ,where rapists and children can play happily together under one NWO umbrella."
5,Research before buy!,"If you know what you are doing, this is a FANTASTIC product. If you don't have the time to read its manual, then, don't buy this!"
2,Not overly impressed,Kind of disappointed with the phone. Get too much echo and cutouts for a 2.4 Ghz phone. Small size is also an issue. Talk button is also very touchy.
1,It looked so cool though...,"The handset doesn't always get seated properly in it's cradle and therefore doesn't charge it's batteries properly. Make sure that the ""Charging"" indicator is lit.I also found that the microphone picks-up so much ambient noise that I've had to cover the mouthpiece just to hear the other person. Also, the phone-cord/power-cord configuration is very annoying to me.Mine also had it's battery overheat and die on me."
2,Its not that good.,"This phone has a couple of serious shortcomings that make it less than ideal for home use. The worst is that if any station answers, all others are cut off from the call. That brings up the second problem: the only way to get another station involved is to conference it in or transfer the call. Transferring the call is complicated- I don't know anyone who has this phone who can transfer a call without referring to a ""cheat-sheet"". The programming is complicated. Although it has a lot of features, most are very hard to access from the handset. I think this phone would be ok for a small business where a trained receptionist ran the phone all day long. But not for a home."
1,Don't buy this phone,"We have owned this phone for over a year and are very disappointed in its performance. The microwave interferes with voice quality very badly. Voice often has echo on other end of call. It loses contact with the base frequently at very short ranges (within my house). It registers a lot of erroneous entries in the caller id call log. Especially when you allow a call waiting to ring thru. The answering machine is cumbersome to review and delete messages. The battery life is unacceptable (less than 12 hrs standby). If the answering machine picks up and you pick up a phone other than a Siemens, the answering machine will not stop. No stop button on the answering machine either."
1,Problems with handset,"I do not recommend this phone due to problems with the handset. I have had it for a few years and problems have gotten progressively worse to the point the phone is practically unusable. In particular the Talk button is extremely difficult to activate when you are turning the phone on or trying to answer a call. It takes several attempts to get it to work. The number buttons are real touchy too making it difficult to dial. You also have to be careful to get the connection right when returning it to the cradle, it can be tricky to get it situated right. I purchased a new phone to replace this one today, it is just way more trouble than it's worth. Don't bother to buy this, it's overpriced and not reliable. Just about anything would probably be better than this!"
1,Took a chance... it's AWFUL.,"...I took a chance and bought the phone.It's beautiful, easy to use, and sounds great while you're using it... but on other end of the line it SOUNDS AWFUL!!!Literally... this phone makes you sound like you're on a cell phone, going through a tunnel."
1,Don't waste your money,"One of the worst phones you'll ever own. Sale, or no sale, it's not worth anything. Static, cuts in and out, strange noises, you name it. Beware the evil phone."
1,Sounds horribe,"I thought this phone would have good sound quality if nothing else (with few other features to speak of). I was wrong, the sound quality is horrendous. I have had times where I have had to switch over to my corded phone when I couldn't hear someone due to the poor quality. I would shop for a different phone."
1,The black phone is not any better,"I purchased a black 240 and I have to agree with the previous comments. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE. My cell phone sounds better when I am in the middle of no where. Phone has static, poor range and poor overall sound quality. I bought this phone to replace a cordless that is 9 years old, and the old one has better sound quality/range. Very disappointed."
3,Good phone...could be better,"I am quite impressed by the Siemens 240. It lacks sophistication, such as LCD display etc, but the sound quality is good. At times, it feels like there is some echo, but you could get used to it by moving the mic away from the mouth. Also there is disturbance around a microwave (only when the microwave is in use). Good coverage area and very crisp sound. Watch for the ""talk"" button, it is too easily activated."
1,Phone with a very poor reception and voice quality,"Don't let the brand name fool you. This phone has a tinny voice and very poor radio reception. At times, it gives static between floors of a colonial house! If I could give 0 stars, I would.. no exaggeration here.. It is unlikely I would buy any autio/telecom product from Siemens again."
4,Slow but Steady,The problem of why irrational behaviors influence our lives is the human dilema. In the Iliad the gods are thinly disguised substitutes for our passions.
2,"Does NOT have ""Active Table of Contents""","I specifically selected this version because it advertized an ""Active Table of Contents"". It does not! I will keep and read this version but really wanted to have access to the TOC and am very disappointed."
5,Brilliant,This book has stood the test of time. It has been read by humanity for centuries and is still a good read today. I think Homer can speak for himself on this one! The nice thing about the Kindle Edition is that the printed book is rather voluminous. The Kindle however is compact and light. But the paperback I have contains both the Illiad and the Odyssey which makes it a rather thick book to use for comparison. I have never owned a single copy of either before.
3,Wonderful literature - this translation does it no justice.,I unfortunately must say that I found this particular translation utterly cumbersome and not what I would hope to see - especially when better ones are certainly out there (Lattimore's English translaiton and Tshernichovsky's Hebrew translation)
5,Classic Story of an Epic Adventure,"Its amazing to get many classic stories for free and getting them through amazon and reading them on your kindle is not only easy, its easy to read and the way things are going to go. The story was classic and I highly suggest downloading as many of the free classics as possible."
4,Iliad,Good service. This is a classic and was badly needed for a class my grandson was taking in California. It was mailed to him and he was most pleased.
1,unreadable,"Not written in English I use. No sentence structure, not even periods of commas... Spent most of the time looking up words I will never use."
3,"19th Century verse translation, formatted as prose","This is a decent if somewhat archaic 19th century translation by the Earl of Derby, but the verse appears as prose, which is distracting. There seems to be a pattern of Kindle editions mangling verse."
4,As expected.,It is a bit more flimsy than I was hoping it will be. Time will tell how well it holds up in the weather.
1,"Used two times, two rips","If you are shorter than 12 feet tall, good luck getting this on without it ripping. I'm 6'5 and still cannot get the top over the heater. It's so snug, and the zipper doesn't go all the way up, so it tears on the wingnuts on top of the heater.If you are using the hearter, it's probably cold outside. Last thing you want to be doing on a cold night is wrestling with a poorly made cover,"
3,"It fits, but it's tight.","It fits but it's tight. I have a lot of problems getting it over the top hood part, even though it's made for my heater. (Maybe I have a slightly different model number?!) It fits eventually. But it's tight like a glove. It's probably a two person job, at least with my heater, because someone has to hold one side and the other person pulls on the other side. It works, keeps out rain, helps prevent rust. Just wish it were an inch or two bigger on the top."
3,Heats a very small area,"It looks great .... but ... has a very small heating radius. I am in Florida and wanted it to keep warm while exiting the pool on cool spring and fall nites. Gave it to my daughter who has an enclosed screened Lanai, it works better in a confined BUT WELL VENTILATED area. I also had to give it a spray with POLY URETHANE to stop roast from forming, it is not meant to be exposed to the elements for long periods. It could have been made better."
3,very difficult to put on,"I bought this patio heater cover because it was the only one I could find that would fit over a heater with a table. I almost couldn't get it on. The zipper in this cover is not long enough. It took 2 people to get it on. I won't use it much because it is so hard to get on. I had bought a different brand for my other heater that didn't have a table. It went on easily, but was too small to accomodate a table."
3,I had to return it. The dimensions are accurate but...,...the way it is cut makes it impossible to get the cover over the heaters top/shield/disc thing. Otherwise it looks like a nice cover.
5,Works great,"Works great, fits perfectly on the patio heater and was easy to setup and install. I recommend this cover absolutely."
4,No complaints,"The cover fits nicely over my heater, and was not as hard to put on as others described (I stand on my patio furniture to do so). The sun seems to warp the outside material a little bit, but it still works great. I does not leak so far (6 months and counting)."
4,Works great,"Need a ladder to get it on, but the cover is a great addition to the heater. Would recommend for the money."
5,Excellent item...,This cover fits perfectly with the Fire Sense outdoor heater I bought. It is well made and protects the heater from any elements it may encounter. I am very happy with my purchase!
4,Pretty Good,"This is a great book fora fast read and a good romance story. It is not, however, a book you should read if you are looking for detail or an in-depth story. Ending kind of obvious, but still a cute book."
3,TOO BAD THE TITLE CHARACTER HAS AN ITALIAN MALE NAME,I think you should do your name history homework.Nicola is an aristocratic male name Only a man's name from Italy for Nicholas. Nicoletta is the only female version.It was bastardized in England in Germany out of ignorance thinking it was female because of the 'a' ending. To continue this misunderstanding is wrong.
4,FINE PERFORMANCE OF THIS HAPPILY-EVER-AFTER,"Want a little romance in your life? Do you have a yen for happy-ever-afters? Then lend an ear to ""Nicola and the Viscount"" as stunningly read by Amanda Root. Having shared the stage with such luminaries as Joan Plowright, Glenda Jackson and Ralph Fiennes, Root has an outstanding background. She's well known to BBC audiences and delivers a blockbuster performance in this reading of Nicola and the Viscount.Raised as an orphan, Nicola longs for love, true and lasting love. She believes she's found it with an incredibly good looking viscount, Lord Sebastian. Surely, she dreams he will soon propose. Well, her dream may come true but there are also clouds on the horizon in the form of hints from Nathaniel that her viscount might not be all that he appears or claims to be.Of course, Nicola is infuriated by such disparaging remarks, but she's also curious. You know what curiosity did to the cat - will it also kill Nicola's romance?- Gail Cooke"
5,Books,I bought this for a gift for a 13 year old girl and she was thrilled. She loves this author so I bought her numerous books from Meg Cabot. It made her Christmas. She loves to read and I gave her plenty of reading material to last her... for about a week. :) She doesn't put the books down until she's done reading them.
3,Not Quite Like Any Regency Romance,"A fan of Meg Cabot's Princess Diaries, I expected to get the same or similar type of writing or style in Meg Cabot's other teen romances. But this is like reading a book by someone else. It doesn't have the bite or wit of the Princess Diaries, and sounds like any of the many regency romance novels sold at supermarkets. I hate to feel this way about any of Meg Cabot's books, but even as a regency novel for teens, it was not as good as other regency novels."
3,It's cute but not as good as Meg's other books.,This one was ok but it wasn't really anything to get excited over. The romantic plot line was a lot like the one in The Princess Diaries which was ok with me. I wanted to smack the heroine a couple of times but I did like the overall plot of the book. It's worth a read if you like Meg Cabot or the Avon True Romance line.
5,Simply the best.,"This recording will put any other rendition of Strauss or Hindemith to shame. Brain plays with a lightness, clarity and flow that the masters of today can only dream about. The Hindemith was written for Dennis Brain, and this recording is conducted by the composer himself. The tragedy of Brain's early death is made all the more obvious by recordings like this. If you care about Horn music at all, heckif you care about soloists at all, but this CD."
4,Great Recording,"I was a bit dissapointed by Brain's interpretation of the Strauss concertii but his performance of the Hindemith Concerto was stunning. True, no one can perform that one better than Brain. However, his true forte was in playing the Mozart Horn collection-that is where he shines the most. For a great recording of the Strauss Horn Concerts, I would recommend Gerd Seifert's (retired Principal Horn of the Berlin Philharmonic) rendition of those peices. It just seems that a German-schooled player does a German peice better than an Englishman. Still, this is a great cd if you want the supreme recording of Hindemith's Concerto."
1,You can get this same CD with more on it remastered for less,"Even though I am in love with this CD, I don't really understand why you'd buy it. The same CD was rereleased by EMI Classics but with an additional 3 tracks - Hindemith's Konzertmusik for Brass and Strings. Also, that CD is cheaper, so I would recommend taking that route."
4,"Heresy to say, but this mono-era classic has been surpassed","Rather than saying that Dennis Brain was the greatest horn player of all time, I prfer to think that he began the age of superstar horn players. In their later recordings of Strauss's two virtuosic concertos, Barry Tuckwell and David Pyatt sound much more exciting than Brain, who also isn't helped by EMI's dated mono sound and the foursquare conducting of Sawallisch. Brain gives us a definitve reading of the Hindemith concerto, but this work hasn't exaclty caught on in the repertoire. I keep Brain's elegeant performances around as a Golden Age memento of a very appealing musician whose early death sealed his lasting reputation."
5,This should have been a huge album,"World trade what an awesome band! Unfortunatly this album came out at a bad time and never really got the exposure it deserved. The interaction between guitars and keys was just brilliant and the bass and drums really hold the songs together. The Vocals and lyrics are top notch with unique harmony vocals as wellThis is an album that doesn't have any bad songs on it but the second album Euphoria was a huge letdown.If you like Rush, Saga, Styx, Kansas, Yes and any of the new progressive rock bands that are out then you should love World Trade!"
2,"Uh, boooring.","I have 3 kids under 5. We've had this toy for 4 years, and they don't even bat an eye at it. We've tried everything to draw attention to this item, but it is either too advanced for even an alphabet-loving 5-year old, or it is boring. I thought it was fun, but my kids don't agree."
3,"Cute, but doesn't hold interest","My daughter received this for Christmas when she was 2.5 years old. Since she loved puzzles and had recently mastered her alphabet, I thought this was the perfect gift. For some reason, however, this puzzle never held her interest. She has now had it for almost 2 years and in all that time I don't think she has once played with it on her own. When I suggest it, she may play with it for a short time, but then she moves on to something else. I generally love the Melissa and Doug products, but I would suggest purchasing a different item."
1,Highly disappoined!!!!!,"I'm very disapointed,it isnot the same item that I see in the photos. This pen is only for ipad. I ordered that item to use the pen both for ipad and as a pen as well. However it does not have the pen feature.I'm highly disapponted by the seller. If I want only a stylus pen, I had already from bluecell for less cheaper."
5,"Good music, also if you don't know Italian.","I discovered Gianna Nannini when I heard the official song of the 1990 Football World Championship in Italy, ""Un'estate Italiana"" with Gianna Nannini and Edoardo Bennato. I bought this album a while ago and it has some really good songs. I don't understand much that she's singing, but I like the melodies and she has a great voice.The album starts with the song ""Un giorno disumano"", a very good song, which is followed by a number of egually good songs. Track number six, ""Peccato Originale"" is a nice, slow song, followed by the faster ""Ti spezzo il cuore"". Number nine, ""Dimmi dimmelo"" and eleven, ""Sola"" are not quite as good as the other songs, but they are absolutely not bad. There are actually no bad songs on this album.This is indeed a very good album. It has a great singer, great songs with a great sound. I don't think you would regret buying it, even if you, like me, don't understand much Italian."
2,Repeats from other collections,"I'm so disappointed: I'd thought this was a Maeve Binchy collection I hadn't read yet, but it's all repeats from other books. I should have read the other reviews!It contains these stories:Tottenham HaleSeven SistersFinsbury ParkHighbury & IslingtonKing's CrossEustonWarren StreetOxford CircusGreen ParkVictoriaPimlicoVauxhallStockwellBrixtonShepherd's BushHolland ParkNotting Hill GateQueenswayLancaster GateMarble ArchBond StreetOxford CircusTottenham Court RoadHolbornChancery Lane"
3,"Victoria Line, Central Line","I love ebooks - I always have my Kindle with me. I have not enjoyed this book by Maeve Binchy so well - started off well but the stories leave the reader hanging, unresolved in my opinion - not the sort of reading I enjoy. Fortunately there are plenty of others by the same author to read."
4,"Nice, easy read","Similar to other Binchy novels just a very nice, quaint, pleasant read. She describes her characters really well and always manages to draw the reader in. Its an easy, quick read if your looking to lose yourselves in glimpses of others' lives. A good way to spend a rainy afternoon."
3,Not a short story buff!,"While I have enjoyed Maeve Binchy's books, must confess that I am not keen on short stories and should have taken more time to check out the title info. If I have time to sit and read, prefer to have a story that I can get into and get to know the characters a bit more. However, the short stories did have some interesting perspectives on people in general and made for very light holiday reading."
2,"Victoris Line, Central Line","These stories were not up to Binchy's standard, but I still enjoy reading her.I always buy her books without even reading the reviews."
3,it's okay,Some stories in this short story edition are good and others just ok. I'll pass it on to another Binchy friend.
2,Slight disappointment,"It took me quite a while to finish the book. I keep on falling asleep unlike her other novels like Echoes, Full House which were pretty difficult to put down."
2,& a welcome to the arms of morpheus,"gary cooper and helen hayes play noble in this early talkie adaptation of hemingways overrated novel of the great war, a rogueish ambulance driver and the fallen woman he loves. cooper was often accused of being stiff, and tho i do not usually accept that assessment, i see it here. unfortunately he is matched by hayes, who might have been a great stage actress (i never saw her there) but was always a pest on screen (was there EVER a more undeserved oscar win than ""airport""?). good hammy performance by adolphe menjou as the almost-villain of the piece, but thats hardly enough to recommend this otherwise stolid affair."
2,A Farewell to Arms,This movie although well ascted in absolutely no way compares to the book. Personaley I fell that in making the book into a movie way to much liberty was taken concerning the plot and storyline.
4,Sensitive and well acted.,"Beware! buy the laserlight copy not the Madacy one!! I bought the latter first, and it's awful. The Laserlight edition ""rescues"" the film into full splendor. A sensitive tale, based upon the Hemingway novel, an directed by the romantic director par-excellence, Frank Borzage. Felt performances by both stars, and an excellent supporting cast. A vintage experience."
1,Beware the Hollywood Classics version,"The Hollywood Classics version of this DVD is very poorly done. Look at the cover! They put ""Cary Grant"" as an actor on the bottom left! They seem to have put even less effort into making the video and sound quality acceptable. They include a sheet stuck into the DVD case explaining how to make the sound quality tolerable, but it didn't help me much. The video is very poor as well. Get a different version if you must, but not the Hollywood Classics version at any price. It is unwatchable."
1,"This is ""Remastered""? You Gotta Be Kidding! A Terrible DVD...I Returned it to Amazon!","I was looking forward to watching A Farewell to Arms starring Gary Cooper and Helen Hayes. The words ""Remastered Edition"" caught my eye and I ordered it -- without reading any reviews.Alas, I only read Carol K's review about the quality of this DVD after I opened it and tried to watch it.I agree with her. If this DVD was remastered, it was remastered from a terrible fourth- or fifth-generation VHS tape. What's more, the sound sync was off. The actors lips were moving, but not in keeping with their words. It was like watching a badly dubbed movie. A fuzzy, badly dubbed movie.I spent five minutes trying to watch the movie, skipping to various scenes ahead to see if the quality improved. I gave up, packed it up, and returned it to Amazon.Do NOT buy this DVD! It's way beyond too expensive for the quality. If this is remastered, I'm a Chinese jet pilot."
3,A disappointing Classic,"I have never watched Farewell to Arms before and bought it on sale. After sitting through it, I wondered why I bought it and sat through all the over dramic yawner. Only thing I could tell was that Gary Cooper was Holleywood's heart throb. I rated it as only ok because of some of the war scenes are actual video of the War."
1,"No, No, No.","This is a VERY poor dvd. I planned on using it for a class and was totally disappointed. The sound does not sync with the picture and the image is poorly digitized. I ended up borrowing the public library's VHS copy, and when a ten year old library VHS is better than a dvd you know it's a bad dvd. The Amazon return policy was the only bright spot about this purchase."
3,Romance Amidst War-Ravaged Italy,"United forever in this 1932 film, are Gary Cooper (1901-61) and Helen Hayes (1900-93) in this chaste adaptation of the 1929 Hemingway novel, whose title - Farewell to Arms - simply means ""desertion"" and questions the very nature of war. As relevant today as it was during WWI, with today's Iraq war raging overseas, the viewer can't help but wonder when we will live to see peace again.The grandeur of the film is in its magnificent cinematography, each shot beautifully framed, which, unfortunately failed to rescue the one-dimensional characters. Cooper and Hayes appeared more like figures in a mortality tale bearing witness to the horrors of war, perfectly exemplified in their roles as lovers doomed.That said, glimpsing the youth and beauty of Gary Cooper and Helen Hayes together made the 90 minute film an unforgettable treasure."
1,Movie should be called A Farewell to A Farewell to Arms,This is all I have to say: Did the director of the movie even read the book?!!! Don't waste your time.
3,True Love and Tragedy,"Based on an Earnest Hemingway best-selling novel, the 1932 film Farewell to Arms, is a touching love story set in war-torn Italy during World War I. Gary Cooper portrays an American ambulance driver in the Italian Army that falls in love with an English Red Cross nurse (Helen Hayes). The trials of war and the jealousy of a friend (Adolphe Menjou) put their love to the ultimate test. Gary Cooper and Helen Hayes deliver great performances and director Frank Borzage creates the feeling of authenticity of the era. The special effects in a film made in 1932 cannot be compared to the technology involved in today's movies, but Frank Borzage worked wonders with the technology available at the time. The ending gave me mixed emotions. The wonderful delivery of Helen Hayes allowed me to forgive the corniness of the final scene. I liked the movie so much I think I will read the novel."
1,WARNING! TERRIBLE TRANSFER!,"It is evident that no DVD or even VHS of decent picture and sound quality is available for the adaptation of Hemingway's novel 'A Farewell to Arms' into a movie.However, I decided to purchase this particular edition by Image Entertainment as I was curious to see the movie, and thought the warnings on the quality were exageratted.I am warning you all, THEY ARE NOT! I have not seen any other editions, but this one was terrible, not only in picture as is most often the case with many old movies, but the sound was also appalling. I cannot even give a decent review of the movie, as the conversation was not audible most of the time (cackling) and there were way too many dust grains and scratches, making the process of 'enjoying' this film very strenuous.I suggest patience, hoping for better negatives/blueprints to be found (if available) that will merit the movie some justice."
4,Sweet stuff.,"This is a lot more sentimental than anything Hemingway ever wrote, but that's alright; it works on its own. Gary Cooper does his usual stick-in-the-mud thing that somehow always worked. He never looked better than in this film. Helen Hayes seems to anticipate the realistic movement in film acting that was still 20 or 25 years ahead at this time. She's not doing her cutesy ""Airport"" stuff here. She's really fine. This is a wonderfully romantic, sweet little date video."
4,Combination of sublime music with simple story,"This is Wagner's most popular opera at the Met. One listen to it and you will know why. The music is superb, and the theme ancient. Grummer is outstanding as Elsa, Thomas is OK as Lohengrin, and Fischer-Dieskau's power is self-evident. The orchestra and chorus are first-rate, and the interpretation is near-perfect. The most significant drawback is the sound quality: based on the old analog medium, the recording's dynamic range is poor and the sound is not up to par as other analog-to-digital remasterings. Nonetheless, this is a good CD."
3,Gardening in Spanish,Lots of useful items if you live in an area with Spanish-speaking gardeners or laborers. Easy to look things up.
5,Grey De Lisle - a diamond in the rough.,"If you are looking for a true country sound, this is it. Grey De Lisle is a talent like so very few. With a voice equal to Carlene Carter and a sound rooted in tradition, you would never guess that this was the woman behind the voices of Vicki on Fairly Oddparents, Frankie on Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, and Mandy on the Grimm Adventures of Billy and Mandy. But that only adds to the fun of it. I not only love good music, which Ms. De Lisle more than provides, but I am also a cartoon buff. I do not own this album yet, but it will very soon be in my collection, as will the rest of her CDs. If you love great country music, buy everything Grey De Lisle has available."
2,Putmayo's early ambitions,"This compilation is hardly the ""Best of World Music."" Then again,when Putumayo first appeared on the scene in 1993,it was one of the few world music labels around,other than Peter Gabriel's Real World,Narada,and Celestial Harmonies,as well as David Byrne's Luaka Bop.The ""Best of World Volume 1:World Vocal"" has its highlights,though they are few.It opens with the rousing,spirited ""Ojala que llueva cafe"" by Juan Luis Guerra y 440.There is the classic,ORIGINAL ""Pata Pata"" from the South African diva Miriam Makeba.The multiracial South African group,Johnny Clegg and Juluka,has the powerful ""Walima 'Mbele."" Kotoja,a Nigerian jazz/rock band from the Bay Area,has the wonderful ""Semi Jeje."" There is also the joyous Creole ""Chanson de Mardi Gras.""While this compilation is not among Putumayo's best,it was a somewhat auspicious beginning.They were only starting."
4,"Progressive, prophetic, and blistering","I'd heard often enough that this was the definitive ATG work (not surprising; a bands first album is often considered their best) but I wasted too much time before getting it - a shame because it is everything it is said to be and more. For those coming in from the Slaughter of the Soul end of things, this album is the complete opposite. There is less in the fast-tempo department and more room for odd rythms, turnaround patterns and weird time signatures; try tapping your foot to this! Several songs feature an extended violin break; at this time there was a full-time violinist in the band, a breath of fresh air for early 90's metal. Every song is vital and has a life of its own; if you're not yet an At the Gates fan, this is a great place to start."
5,Bra's and Broomsticks an amazing book,"What would you do if your sister was a witch? Well in Bra's and Broomsticks by sarah Mlynownski you can find out what the main character Rachel will do. There are many problems along the way such as Rachel trying to stop the wedding between her father and her step mom to be,Jennifer. Rachel is a very greedy character. She convinces her sister,Miri, to cast spells for her. She wants to make the dance team so she can become popular so Miri gives her a spell. But will it work? You can find out by reading this mellow paced book. I would recomend this book to girls the ages of 11-18. If you like a fun, cute,and easy to read book, then Bra's and Broomsticks is the book for you."
4,Tween book is bewitching!,"I have read all of Sarah Mylnowski's books to date and was 'charmed' to see that she had a new novel out. Eagerly snapping up the book at the store I didn't realize that this book was written for a younger audience. Although it became obvious early on that the target consumer was younger girls coming of age, I really enjoyed reading Bras and Broomsticks. It's the story of an ordinary teenage girl, Rachel who finds out one day that her younger sister and mother have extraordinary talents- they are both witches! The fun begins as Rachel tries to convince her sister to use witchcraft for her own selfish reasons. This book was cute and a quick read. I enjoyed it and plan to read the next novel in the series. It's good for 'girls' of all ages!"
4,A cute read,"I really enjoyed this book as it was fun, refreshing, funny and so identifiable, even though my own teenagehood is so far in the past. Sarah Mlynlowski really nailed the voice of a 14 year and you were really right there with her as she struggled through the knowledge that her sister had inherited this ""gift"" that somehow skipped her. The story was relatable to readers of all ages. The only ""complaint"" is that the story didn't really end or have a happy ending, but rather was baiting to have the reader buy the next book. (Which I'll do. :) Would have liked to have seen a total wrap-up of the story. But all in all, a very cute, fun read and a good job by the author."
4,Very cute,This book is a cute funny story. I am glad I bought it. I was very satisfied and I am waiting for what happens next in the story.
5,I love it!,"My friend introduced me to the King's Singers and although I've listened to this cd about 50 times I still love listening to it! It isn't their best cd, but it's still awesome!"
2,"Disappointing, for a group with such an a cappella legacy","Though the King's Singers consistently show that they maintain as consistent an a cappella sounda as any group in the world, and though their sound remains distinctive, this CD, with its orchestral accompaniaments and campy arrangements, fails to appropriately show off their range of talent. With the exception of ""I'm a Train,"" by now an a cappella standby (and performed a cappella here), the CD is somewhat of a disappointment, especially to close fans."
3,Not Cheesy Enough For Me.,"This movie wasnt really what I was expecting.I dont know why its found under a zombie movie category because it has nothing even close to a zombie.The plot is pretty good.Its a good idea and a amazing film considering the budget.I just expected more from it.The 2 or 3 gory scenes it has (Especially Chocolate Chip Charlys' demise) were really really awesome looking.I just expected more from it.Bottom line,I thought the movie drags most of the time.Gets kinda boring.Ill probably never watch it again,but its still worth a look."
2,One of the best bad movies,"The stuff is poorly edited, but a great story. Horror, humor, and low production quality combine to make a great bad science fiction movie."
1,Ummmm....,"I wanted to see this movie so very bad when my friend and I saw the preview of it. The preview made us laugh so hard and it looked like a good ol' B movie. Well, I hate to say it but this movie was a dissapointment in my book. Everything you see that is cool in the preview is the only thing worth watching in the movie. This movie had its funny parts but few and far between. If it is at your local video store and you have a free coupon this is a good movie to rent with a bunch of friends. This is a type of movie that is just so bad that your friends will have fun making fun of it. The movie would have been better if I didn't expect it to be an awesome B movie."
2,A B-movie with a little more substance,"Michael Moriarity is my hero! He is just one of the coolest actors in my opinion. He has done such great B-movies as this, Q, and It's Alive 3: Island of the Alive. How awesome is he?? Anyways, I think that this movie was hilarious! I think a lot of people take this movie too seriously, thinking that it is going to be your typical movie. But you shouldn't because not only is this a B-movie, but IT IS supposed to be funny. My favorite part is when ""the stuff"" started bubbeling out of the ground and that old hick guy just starts eating it. Who would do that?? I just started laughing by butt off when that happened. So if you watch this movie, just sit back and enjoy it for what it's worth, don't be too critical on it.What I learned from The Stuff: Dairy products are evil! Especially if they come from with in the earth!If you like The Stuff, I recommend: Watching other B-movies, such as Island of the Alive 3, Zombi 3 and 4, etc."
4,This is why I watch 'B' movies!,"Attack of the killer marshmellow fluff!Quick premise... white stuff oozes from the ground... old dude sticks his finger in it and gives it a taste...?""mmmmm good!"" .... ""Let's masss market this."""
3,Yeah,I like zombie movies but this one just didn't have that zombie feel to it. Well I didn't throw it away after watching.
4,"You just cant get enough, of the stuff","Learn it, live it, love it. Remember, sometimes you need to eat shaving cream to survive."
3,EDIBLE BLOB,"A very interesting film. IT is a parody and spoof of the advertising world.... It seems that this weird white yogurt-like desert is catching the nation by storm....and it turn out that the more you eat it, the more you became addicted to it..and pretty soon the STUFF takes over your body. Good performances by Michael Moriarty., although the special effects may look a bit cheesy at times...it is obvious that shaving cream was used to simulate the stuff pouring down and out various places.Not the best film ever made, of course, but an interesting one, at that."
4,Continuing special effects: then & now.,"The acting was good to great and the dialog corny and funny with special efforts on Scott Bloom, Michael Moriarty and Garrett Morris' part/role to keep it funky & lively. The storyline carried this flik, partially, with focus on good overcomes evil in the fad food market in spite of continuing foul-ups on lead & supporting actors ideas and often hambone lines. A fun movie that requires limited viewer attention to be entertained and laugh at set-up scenes that bordered on rediculous to incredible. The creative special effects held my interest to the happy ending. Definitely a good movie to kick back, relax and enjoy. I would like to have this collectors item in my video library."
2,Not every bad film is a cult classic,"Sometimes a bad film is just that, a bad film.Moriarty is a great actor, when he wants, and ""Q"" is a much better showcase for his many talents.Maybe ""The Stuff"" had a good premise, but it fails in the execution. It looks allover as if it were made quickly and on the cheap.The good reviews come from folk who, IMO, are using their own power of imagination to fill in the cracks in the storyline and acting. This is not a put down - most of the positive folks are seeing what should/could have been, rather than what it is.Wait until the price goes down, if you must have it.My recommendation is: Rent, don't buy this Z movie."
4,80's B flick at it's best!,"This movie would probably not be on anyone's top ten list but it is a must see for the 1980's B flick movie loving enthusiast! The Stuff is an interesting look at consumerism in the 80's and the hairstyles and outfits are just plain hilarious!I remember renting this movie (on Beta) in my childhood over and over again, much to my parents chagrin. The Stuff will bring you back and make you glad the past is where it is."
3,"Funny, yet disturbing B class movie","This movie is interesting. It takes a funny concept and plays with it, while still being gross and scary enough to justify its catergory. The plot make sense, but is comical because ""the stuff"" is like reactive goo that takes over people and then erupts from their mouths like the cover, not that good, but definetly unique."
4,Trash to OWN for any B Horror Fan!,"Amazingly bad! Are you eating it... or is it eating you?Yes, that's actually the tag line. For any fan of awful horror movies I wouldnt recommend renting this. Just buy it. Show your friends and we can all laugh at Cohen's cross-eyed brainchild. I hope this movie was meant to be funny, cause if not-- I feel for them. I give this movie 4 stars simply for its uniqueness."
3,Disappointed,I am disappointed in this book. I buy about every CIA book I can get my hands on because I am sorry that I didn't go there. I expected more useful recipes than this book presented.
3,corrupted minds,"This film definitely falls under the indie title. There was an array of corruption about people who hang out in the wee hours in the big city. whose judgement is tested in the mean streets of Detroit. It was nice to see the scenes around Detroit, we never get to see Detroit in films. They like to make mention of Detroit on a pretense that it is filmed here, so this was good to see."
4,Independent Film as Good as Hollywood,"DO NOT let an unknown cast and crew from Detroit fool you! This film is very competitive with nearly any Hollywood makes. Starting with the excellent cinematography, this art film tells the story of Canadian filmmakers coming to Detroit to make a documentary depicting the motor city as typical third world. Like with anything that gets a bad rap, the lead filmmaker exploits the city by hiding its good points so as to better market his movie. Fully knowing its the bad points that sell."
5,MPG gumbo soup,What a great album from the PMG. It's like a Gumbo soup with so many flavors and textures added. From soulful riffs to uplifting vocals just about every song is a 10. If you love the PMG group you'll love this album. It is more of a main stream smooth jazz album from Pat Metheny than say the Song X album he did with Ornette Coleman.
1,!que horterada!,"!Qué horror!. Haganmé caso, cualquier aficionado al jazz que se mantenga alejado de discos como éste. Antes de nada quiero dejar claro que yo no soy un purista, me gusta todo tipo de música, jazz, clásica e, incluso, algo de rock. Pero discos como éste no pueden ser definidos como ""fusión"" sino como ""horterada"". ""Beat 70"" no desentonaría nada en cualquier disco de Juan Luis Guerra, ""Dream Of The Return"" podría pasar por la nueva balada de Luis Miguel, 45/8 podría servir de entrada a un corrido de Bertín Osborne. No quiero pasarme de crítico ya que respeto todo tipo de gustos musicales y el buen hacer profesional de Mr. Metheny, pero dejando claro que este tipo de discos (en general le pasa a buena parte de la discografía de este guitarrista) solo es adecuada para gente que se mueve en parámetros músicales cercanos al AOR y, en general, a música sin demasiadas pretensiones. En fin, de todo tiene que haber."
1,Which floor?,"I'm sorry, but this is elevator muzak pure and simple. I bought 'Letter From Home' in 1989 aged 16 and it sounded dated even then. I'm absolutely horrified that some reviewers imagine this to be a jazz album. It isn't. It's bland, facile rubbish. Buy John Abercrombie's 'November' and find out what a real six-stringer can do in the name of jazz."
3,Meh,"I wasn't crazy about this when it was released, and it hasn't aged well. Too lightweight, relies too much on old tricks collected from the previous three or four PMG records. Also no standout tracks, which is rare for a Metheny record. The playing is solid as usual but, again, it all just glides past you -- OK for what it is but that's all. If you want a good record from this period, Still Life (Talking) or First Circle should get you there."
5,An expression of fusion leadership -,Metheny and Mays weave a melodic web and from impressionistic cloth. Pat and Lyle's collaboration on Have You Heard sets the pace for an up tempo exploration of alternate blues mixed with just enough fusion to keep it honest. Mays Evanistic retraint and chordal working is haunting to say the very least. Just what I expected (and hoped for). Recommend it highly and give it all the stars.
2,Warping Wood,"This is a very nice looking feeder....for a little while. It is the perfect height for my Golden Retriever. Unfortunately, he drips water on the wood when he drinks, so after two months it is ruined. I even tried to dry it off each time I saw a splash. The wood has warped and peeled and for the price I am very disappointed. My suggestion would be to get a raised wrought iron feeder instead )-:"
3,"It works, but...","The mirror comes with very ordinary peel and stick foam for a water seal.Just took a 500 mile trip. This mirror vibrates much more than the factory mirror.It is not a problem with the install, this vibration is the mirror shaking more in its shell than the factory mirror."
5,FIVE STARS ARE NOT ENOUGH,"IF YOU DO'NT HAVE THIS CD , GET IT !THIS MAN CAN SING LIKE NOBODY ELSE.THE AWESOME SOUND OF HIS DREAMY ,SOULFUL VOICE COUPLED WITH SONGS FROMSOME OF THE BEST SONGWRITERS ALIVEMAKE ""DO'NT GIVE UP ON ME"" A MUSTFOR ANYONE WHO LIKES MUSIC PERIOD .FROM DAN PENN,BOB DYLAN,VAN MORRISON,TOM WAITS,JOE HENRY,BRIAN WILSON,ELVIS COSTELLO,NICK LOWE,BARRY MANNAND BACK TO VAN CAME A SET OF SONGSSO WELL PRODUCED AND PERFORMED THEYWILL TAKE YOU TO HIGHER GROUND !SOLOMON HAS AN UNDENIABLE GIFT ANDJOE HENRY DID A FABULOUS JOB MAKINGTHIS CD....BUY IT,IF YOU DO'NT ,YOU'RE MISSING THE BOAT PEOPLE !!!!James Hardie McGehee,singer/songwriter."
5,Became my car music for more than a week,"Solid and meaningful music, contempary but with distinct soul sound that I grew up with in the south."
3,Where's Chips Moman When You Need Him?,"Solomon is in great voice -- mellow like Brook Benton -- but the project suffers i think,from the production of Joe Henry. He doesn't have the vision of Chips Moman of Jerry Wexler. Forexample, he buried the organ so deep in the mix at times that it sounds like a noise coming fromout the window. The fadeouts could come much quicker and, the back up singers; are theysinging through a Leslie speaker? Hey, that'd be great if you're listening to the Beatles, but thattype of ""clever"" production detracts from the effort of a fine old timer like Burke.And, for all of the hoopla about the ""Rock Star"" songwriters, I found the material to be lacking anddisjointed and more an exercise in their egos than contributing to Solomon's."
4,Still the best album of 2002 thus far,"It isn't a perfect record, but Solomon Burke pulls more emotion out of a phrase than most pop singers can in a whole album of material. The production is simply flawless. The title track alone is certainly the single of the year, but then it is written by Dan Penn. Always trust a man named Solomon."
2,What a disappointment!,"I really wanted to like this CD, but I found it to be nearly unplayable. Burke's vocals are fine - but the production! I don't know how it got out of the studio with that mix - it's muddy and the background singers and band sound as veiled and muted as though I were hearing them through a closed door. The first time I played it I felt the disc had to be defectve - I cleaned and replayed it all the way through and came to the conclusion it was just a lousy production. I didn't play it for another 6 to 8 weeks thinking for some reason I would ""come around"" but, alas, I ended up trading it in on another CD at a local retailer. Too bad!"
1,COME AS YOU ARE!!!!,I THINK THATS WHY SO MANY PEOPLE RUN FROM CHRISTIANITY IS BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS WANTING TO CHANGE PEOPLE THEY DON'T EXCEPT THEM THE WAY THEY ARE. YOU ARE WHAT YOU ARE. GOD DID NOT COME HERE TO CONDEM YOU' HE LOVES YOU REGARDLESS! I DISAPPROVE OF ANY BOOK WHO TRIES TO CHANGE ANYBODY!
2,Ghost Stories-Too Short,"I bought this book because I love ghost stories and pictures of haunted castles. However, this book provided none of that. It is more like world guide of haunted places, and each place gets a couple of pages of fanciful description and then the address. It did not provide the beautiful castle pictures, nor the involved, ghostly stories based on history I was looking for."
4,Hauntings?,"A great book that is informative, but would like it to have more substance and more ghost phenomena written down for the castles. it feels like a quick run down of certain local tourist hotspots, and does not give much information about the particular hauntings that go on at the locales."
1,Terse Stories,"First of all the title of this book is misleading, eitherthe Author is not aware of other hauntings or selective withhis list. His description of hauntings are terse and almostincomplete.Second, missing from this list are well known ghosts of BerlinOld Castle (to be rebuilt soon), the Hofburg, Habsburg Castles,Malacanang Palace of Manila etc.Third, there is no bibliography. Where did he get his stories?Not worth for this price."
4,A not so spectacular sequel...,"This is the not-so-spectacular sequel to the original smash 1981 film ""Heavy Metal"".The original film was much in the style of the magazine-- largely episodic, jumping from story to story, very much like the original magazine, which contained several on-going storylines with one or two stand-alone stories. This film abandons that episodic format, and sticks to one story. Unfortunately it's very derivative of a story that was already in the first film, ""Taarna.""Mildly adult in 2010, the animation in this film is somewhat lacking, as are original ideas, plot twists, the few nude scenes and single sex scene. This was all done in the first ""Heavy Metal"" and done better, as well. Too bad. I'll bet the failure of this killed the movie franchise for any further efforts. And people wonder why there's no good Adult Animation in the U.S.A.?"
2,not up to par,"If you are looking for a movie as good as the original ""Heavy Metal"", pass on this one. It is a vehicle for letting Julie Strain waggle her assets in Anime format. The voice acting is incredibly bad. The animation is not nearly as good as the original. I watched it hoping for much much better. See it if you must but you have been warned."
3,Not such a great example of Heavy Metal,"I am a long-time subscriber of Heavy Metal (the magazine) and I believe that, along with many others, that the original Heavy Metal film was a much better display of the creativity of these kinds of artists.This movie, while I do like, seemed just not on point. It is still worth a watch but...rent it before you decide to make the purchase."
2,Heavy Metal 2000 - All but there.,"Well it is here. The update to Heavy Metal has a quality feel to it, the sound quality is good compared to the original, the animation quality is better than the original, and the intergrated 3D animation was well done. It just doesn't do it for me. All the elements are up to date, but the story, cuts, and flow are not much to hold you. As a Heavy Metal Fan it is worth while to see. I would not recomend it to anyone otherwise. It is just a little less interesting than episodic Animé"
1,A vain attempt.,"Like my title suggests this movie is a vain attempt to take credit from the first movie to sell sub-par music to a new generation of viewers. The first Heavy Metal obviously had some thought put into the scenes and the pace of the story line. The artistry was phenomanal in the first movie, much better than the mish mosh of computer graphics and hand drawn animation in Heavy Metal 2000. The first movie made sure the music reinforced and enhanced whatever scene was being played, the second, well the music really did not add much if anything at all the movie. To sum up...boring plot, no imagination, and a sound track to not die for. My advice? Use the DVD as a coaster and read a good Frank Herbert novel instead."
1,the animation is good but the music....,"todays metal almost has no listenership, why? it has so little melody, gone in this movie are good melodic metal songs from 80's bands who could sing, instead we get the awful thrash metal that helped make metal one of the least popular types of music on the planet. sure people like the old stuff but todays metal is sucko mostly so by using that type of thrash junk in this they insured few could sit through the movie. I liked the story but you had to suffer through the music."
3,"Better than expected, considering","Better than expected, after reading the some of the reviews and re-watching its predecessor. Gone is the Ralph Bakshi-esque rotoscoping and the mixed quality vignettes; in come the digital modelling/FX, smoother animation and movie-length revenge plot. Basically this is the type of thing that you might see on ""Adult Swim"" on Cartoon Network, which itself is kinda like HM (the magazine) at times.As for the soundtrack, I'd consider it a bunch of modern but otherwise forgettable bludgeon-metal tracks that work as combat-sequence fodder but otherwise feel out of place (as with the first film.) Not a great movie, but decent."
2,Predictable,"I remember that the original was a bunch of loosely connected stories. This one tells one tale, not too badly, but also too interested in including specific elements that had to be part of the movie's image more than letting the story flow. Of these ""required"" elements, it of course had to be science fiction, there had to be a lot of violence, plus completely gratuitous nudity featuring totally buff women with improbable breasts. I like that a lot of effort was made to tell a whole story, but it looks like a bunch of producers got together, figured out the lowest common denominator for their audience, and dished out standard movie fare for them, cafeteria-style. With the same resources, they could have taken the ""Final Fantasy"" route, at least plot-wise, but chose the easy road."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"I'm a big fan of the Heavy Metal comic series and I loved the first movie, but this wasn't what I had hoped. Don't get me wrong, the animation is crisp, clear, and clean and it's great to look at, but the story is pretty uninspired. It's gory, violent, funny, and it's just a fun movie to watch, but if your expecting to see greatness like in the first movie, avoid this. But if you like adult animation with a twist, give it a try. By the way, the soundtrack rocks, and the Pantera song really enhanced the air battle scene in the beginning."
3,Definitely in the spirit of the original,"There is little reason why you should like the first movie without enjoying this one. All the violence, sci-fi, and most of the sex is still there. This time, however, the movie is one full-length story. The plot, animation, and characters are very much in the same vein as each of the individual segments of the previous movie. The music is fairly appropriate too. In fact, the sequel is pretty much faithful to the style of its original. However, the story lines between the two are NOT connected. By the way, Billy Idol is the voice of one of the characters..."
5,Better than the first!,"If you are a fan of Heavy Metal... then youre gonna love this one! Although it runs roughly the same time as the original Heavy Metal, Heavy Metal 2000 packs a more powerful story, dazzling computer Special Effects, and a much more artistically cleaned up backround and character design. With the awesomely violent kill scenes, comes the best in hardcore heavy metal music, that sets the tone for not only a great sequel.... but a great film altogether. If ever in the video store, pick up Heavy Metal 2000, youll like what you see! (Sountrack includes Billy Idol, Insane Clown Posse, Panterra, and many more!)"
2,Not very special.,"This film is better than the original Heavy Metal, which is not saying much. The animation is far superior, the story admittedly stronger. However, many of the characters, including the heroie, are absolutely mean. Julie is a strong character, yes. But does strong necessarily mean hard? Her sister is much more likable. I hope Julie Strain is nothing like her character. Also, there is too much gore. If you have to see it, wait to watch it on cable instead."
2,Saturday morning cartoon at best,"Oh, boy, were we disappointed! We've waited for several years for this episode. And for our patience what is our reward? Junk. The story is childish. The art is boring after the first 10 minutes. The soundtrack detracts (if that's possible). I have been an enthusiastic and loyal fan/subscriber/collector of Heavy Metal magazine since 1977 and to be honest, I can't imagine this horrible movie coming from the same shop. T&A are the only redeeming bits that keep this space clunker from losing all it's stars. If you want to experience some of HM's finest work, rent the original HM movie on DVD."
1,A Waste of Film!,"I won't waste a lot time in this review. Simply awful. The animation is weak (a few noteworthy parts), the music forgettable, and the story predictable. The original Heavy Metal film had more going for it. I like the original and the mazazine that inspired both films, but this release is sad."
4,Better than expected,This animated movie is much better than the original Heavy Metal. Animation is excelent. Music ROCKS. I will probably buy the soundtrack. Has a decent storyline also.
2,OK Metal,"Alright attempt to follow up of the Classic original. It was entertaining and the music was alright, but over all it was OK. It does not compare to the original."
2,Nothing like the original,"I got this and the original after seeing the South Park tribute. The original was fantastic, but this was disappointing at best. Save your money and pass on this one."
2,Nowhere near the original 1981 movie !,"I bought the dual DVD package with both 1981 and 2000 Heavy Metal movies. The 1981 was an enchantment ! True, free, creative, poetic, powerful, humorous, ... In fact, far and away from ""politically correct"" that is the rule everywhere now. How refreshing ! In comparison, the 2000 opus is predictable, polished, not funny one bit, boring, tasteless, and in its way, conventionnal. (and we could do without the heavy promotion of Julie Strain ...). The 1981 is up there, with an unique atmosphere, ""true"" with all its imprefection. The 2000 polished version is down here, has no juice, and never ""gets off"" ..."
2,Complete & Utter Failure,The original Heavy Metal is a classic. The sequel fails to live up to expectations. The animation seems rushed and badly done throughout.
4,Heavy Metal 2000,"DVD was in perfect condition, no skips and was received quickly!!great item and great seller"
3,Julie Strain is ...,"The animation is OK and some of the songs are quite Good. The voices are good, I really enjoyed to hear billy idol and Tyler (don't remember the name of the actor). The storyline could have been better ... there's to much ""cliché"" in this movie. But what I really hated here is the way they promote Julie Strain (the real one). You see pictures of here when the heroes are in a city, all the extra are oriented to tell us ""how julie strain is fantastic"", ... and she lack of modesty. It's quite bad when the story & spirit of HM is put behind only to put in front a person from reality. Gave 3 stars anyway for animation, music and design (Since english is not my main language, sorry if it's not easy to read)."
1,A Waste of Time,"The appeal of the original was that it was an animated version of the magazine. The appeal of the origial magazine was the mixture of styles, and the effortless ""bad boy"" attitude it exuded as a whole. As to the meandering plot? That was part of the appeal. If you didn't like one approach, there were at least three or more others that would turn you on! Heavy Metal 2000 misses the point entirely. It was flat, boring and felt like ""Walt Disney Gets a Woody"". I mean, it even had the same visual style of ""Beauty and the Beast"". The effortless adolescent raunch of #1 was replaced with the forced, ""Aren't we bad? tee-hee!""And get a load of the hero, a whiny genXer that the original Den would have snapped in two. He wasn't cool, he was a pain! The heroine just kept missing the mark. The whole thing was kid stuff!Don't waste your money, rent the second one and buy the first one and prepare to leave your brain at home!"
3,I prefer this to the first,"The first Heavy Metal was in my opinion a waste of time. They had six stories that were connected only by a strange green orb and other than that had nothing to do with each other besides sex and gore (which for some is a good thing). Heavy metal F.A.K.K. 2 (or HEavy MEatal 2000) however is in my opinion the better film. For one thing they focus on one story this time. The story is about a young women who is out for revenge after an insane captain attacks her planet so he can find the secret to immortality. He capturtes the people and kills those who defy him, or just some for the hell of it. SHe seeks out to stop him and eventually tehy battle on the planet where the secret is held.BEcause of the further focus on story that means that the sex and gore had to be toned down some. Not to the extent that it would drive people away but just enough to tell a good story. However in the end it just doesn't live up. In the end it would be for fans only."
2,only in name,"this one is not really worth the small price you pay,, not like original at all. Left me feeling limp"
5,Serious jazz for mature audiences,"Ok, it's not a straight-ahead jazz recording, and there might be something incongruous about playing Bach on the vibes, but this is serious stuff to be taken seriously. Serious and/or classical composers allowed for a certain amount of spontaniety or improvisation in some of their compositions--particularly their concerti. Why not show off the genius of both jazz and classical compositions--especially when they are as well done as they are in the hands of MJQ? I think this is a great recording, and in all probability, one that is under-appreciated."
4,A technical marvel and a real joy,"One thing about this album that is perhaps under-recognised is the superb quality of the recording - this is possibly the best recorded double bass sound I've ever heard, and the percussion is crystal clear (perhaps a mixed blessing, depending on one's opinion of how many bells and chime strings are strictly necessary on a couple of the tracks). The key to this album is to approach it with a sense of humour; there is a degree of appropriate respect shown to the Bach material, but once you realise that the superficially ""hokey"" treatment given to the Jesu Joy of Man's Desiring theme on ""Precious Joy"" is a colossal musical joke rather than a serious attempt, it really does give you an understanding of the reality behind the rather straight-laced image of the MJQ"
5,Great Album,"As someone who is beginning to explore his interests in classical music and jazz, I found this CD to be extremely good. I can't wait to check out other MJQ works. Favorites of mine on this album include, ""Blues in A Minor"", ""Precious Joy"", and ""Blues in C Minor."""
5,Brilliant,"Angel Romero is a gem. I don't have any remarkably sophisticated way of expressing this, so I'll just say it in basic terms:This album is REALLY REALLY REALLY GOOD.For me, the real gem is the Fantasia para un Gentilhombre, which Angel brings to life in a way I've never heard before (Even Segovia's version isn't quite as luminous!)"
5,Rodrigo - Concierto de Aranjuez; Elogio de la guitarra; fantasia para un gentilhombre,"Wonderful! An excellent arrangement with beautiful orchestration. The title piece: ""Concierto de Aranjuez"" is a genuinely moving piece of music. This is one CD which is going to be getting A LOT of play in my home. And it was delivered in a very timely manner. A+"
1,Poor design,"The sole of this shoe is made from several glued pieces of rubber, instead of painting one piece for multiple colors. This is poor design, as the pieces come off and the shoe slips easily. Get a different sole design."
3,Nice for what it is,"These little Bible are a nice size to carry just about anywhere. The downside is they are NOT REAL LEATHER but a ""leather like"" material. Every thing about it says cheap. I really wish I could say more. Perhaps the best feature is the snapping flap."
5,Salreno-Sonnenberg at her best,"This recording is one of the best I ahve ever heard of the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto. Sonnenberg's performance is breathtaking, fiery and musically great"
3,Weak recording of the violin,Sonnenberg's violin sometimes sounds distant on this recording. It probably could have used closer miking. I had trouble hearing the violin at times and if I raise the volume the orchestra sounds too loud.
3,devil in the details,"entertaining travelogue-however, many mistakes regarding military in particular-seems to get genls' sherman and sheridan mixed up--doesn't seem to know there's a difference between cavalry and army--description of sand creek affair and cheyenne war heavy on political correctness and short on facts"
1,Huge waste of money,"This thing is such a joke. You put just a few things on it and it can't hold it's own weight, it easily collapses and loses its form. Save your money."
3,Good and Bad,"Love how much space it has and it holds a lot of diapers!! That being said, I didn't like that it only attaches with the Velcro because it doesn't stay very well. Also, the shelf above the stacker tilts forward so it is hard to put anything there."
1,useless!!,"Absolutely a waste of money. ""Sticky"" tabs don't hold any weight and it fell off within 5 min of hanging it from the dresser."
4,Good!,"I'm not sure why so many people panned this product. I've had it up in my nursery for 2 weeks and it looks and functions well. My only issue is that the velcro straps are not long enough, so I neatly rigged it with some twine and it's plenty stable. The bins aren't sagging (so far) and it holds just what I need."
1,Its not firm like the picture,"The pockets sag really bad, I am not even sure I will be able to use it on the wall behind the changing table because I am scared the items I store will slide forward and fall on the baby. Not well built.I was very excited about this product but it was a total waste of money."
1,do not recommend,i have one issue with this product: it does not stay horizontal. it sags and everything but the diapers fall out. i hung it on the side of my pack n play and it just sags and hangs there.
1,An unstable safety hazard! Zero stars!,"I purchased this diaper organizer to hang on my Delta Luv changing table, because there was no storage space on top. I had high hopes for it--Munchkin products are usually high in quality. However, the cloth on this organizer sags. When I tried to fill it with my wipes box, baby powder, and lotion--as shown in the picture--the pockets tipped forward and everything fell out. I wouldn't want a toddler getting near this organizer! A much safer option is the plastic ""Diaper Depot"" by Prince Lionheart."
1,Terrible quality,"This product is a great idea in theory, and it was just what I needed. But the construction is very very poor. The shelves don't stay horizontal once you start putting items. I put a pack of wipes in the top middle, a small purell on the top left and a Desitin on the top right, and the thing is already coming apart. VERY DISAPPOINTED!"
2,Sounded great!,"I bought this hoping it would help me organise all my baby diapering needs. Unless you have a changing station (or crib, wherever you want to hang it) that has slits or slots able to hold it - the velcro will NOT hold it well. And the ""shelves"" are a bit insecure. It's a great idea, but just didn't pan out."
1,Terrible,"I don't know why any company would want to put their name on this product. It is so flimsy and saggy and if I could give it zero stars I would - this piece of junk was immediately returned to the store. I bought it to hang on the side of our pack n play since we use it a lot for diaper changes and I wanted more storage space for things like qtips, thermometer, cloth diaper supplies, etc. It held diapers ok but if you put wipes on top as shown in the pic, the whole thing sags and the wipe container falls out easily. The side pockets also do not hold up. So you are better off just getting a diaper stacker since thats about all it is good for. I attached it to the pack n play with the adhesive velcro that was included in the box. The adhesive held up better than the velcro did...it un-velcroed (for lack of better term) within 5 minutes of me hanging it up and putting stuff in it."
1,"High hopes, low outcome","I saw this product at the store and thought it was an awesome solution for saving space. It was the last one on the shelf, and I walked out of there feeling so lucky to have bought it. I love finding ways to organize anything and so I couldn't wait to get home and try it out. Munchkin, you disappoint me! It's a great concept, but awful in execution. The whole thing tips forward, the diapers don't stack well, the fabric started to fray, and I hadn't even used the thing yet. I thought mounting it to the wall would be a good solution for the tipping issue, but it didn't help, and it's quite the eyesore. I am not exaggerating when I say this is the worst product I've bought for my baby so far. In short, don't waste your money or time on this product, it doesn't even deserve one star."
1,Flinsy... can't fill all of the compartments because it will FALL DOWN!,"Just as the title states... with a package of diapers in the diaper stacker and a few baby washes, the velcro on this item comes apart and the item falls down. Useless, in my opinion, to organize anything."
1,Don't waste your money,"Like most of the reviews, the shelves tilt and the products I keep on it keep sliding off. This product should be taken off the market or the makers should improve on the quality"
2,Bad News For Munchkin,"I usually love Munchkin's stuff so I purchase this diaper oraganizer, boy was I dissapointed! Its flimsy and unstable. Its fallen off my wall at least five times so I'm lucky I didn't place it close to my daughter's crib."
5,great,"Came in wonderful condition, no damages to the product at all.. Sound great.. My dad was pleased.. And so am I, will buy from these guys again!"
5,The deepest hardest blues,"This music is clear-eyed, bright, and hard. ""Aragon Mill,"" ""Tommorow's Already Lost,"" and, well, everything else is impossibly beautiful and harsh. There are a lot of over used adjectives for deeply American music like this, and they really all apply. Listening to this music you know you can trust what she says. Listening to this music you also know that you should be looking out as much as you can for people who are not as fortunate as you. I first heard her singing ""Conversation with Death"" on Songcatcher, and just knew that I would have to listen to everything she's done. As a fan I hope she makes a record either by herself, with Iris Dement, Alice Gerrard, or whoever she wants to and makes a million bucks. As a person I just hope I can live up to what her work makes me feel. With the political weather the way it is now, this hard world will just get harder."
5,Brillian Book,I love reading about relativity theory and quantum physics. I don't have a background on neither so I need a book who be clear and enjoyable to read at the same time. This book is both. George Gamow makes both subjects seem easy to understand and describes them in a fun and cute way. I recomend this book to anyone who is intersted in physics.
4,It helped me understand...,"I'm a novice at this subject matter, and I've recently started reading introductory books on quantum physics for fun. I read, ""The New Quantum Universe"" prior to reading this. This easy to read book filled in some gaps that that I had. It helped me grasp some concepts that had otherwise passed over my head when reading the other book.I understand that this is a classic text and I can see why. It's fun to read, and provides a foundation for further understanding. It explains uncertaintity, radioactive decay, and electron shells especially well.I may not fully appreciate the concepts I was able to internalize from this book for quite some time. I can say that I strongly recommend it to the layman or anyone who's eager to understand some basics of this incredible field of study."
4,Very Entertaining,I wish they made an animation movie from this book. This is very nice introduction into Modern Physics expecially for those who is interested in Physics in young age but does not have rigorous knowledge of mathematics or physical concepts to understand it or for those who knows it but can not explain it to a teenager. Concepts covered is Relativity and Quantum Mechanics where speed of light is reduced to very low valus or Planck constant is increased to managable levels. You can see the strangness in everyday experiences.Very fun to read or to give as a present to young future Physicist.
5,great buy! rare-ish item,great find. excellent condition. fast delivery. this is a rare item and we were excited to find it in such good shape.
5,Loved this book!!,"I am an avid reader of quilt history and found this book to be a remarkable sideline item. It deals very little with the actual quilt, but rather uses it as a jumping off point to study the life of a woman who owned it. It deals directly with the hardships and lifestyles of the women who settled the country through the story of one lonesome girl uprooted by marriage."
3,good subject but little new information,"Great subject, there is very little about a man who influences the lives of so many people.However, I found little or no new information about Dawood Ibrahim, that is already not published in any other source. It is a summary of most published material.The book is also quite repetitious and repeates the same information quite a few times. I wish there was more information about his empire and about his rise to power. I guess the reason cited in the book about journalists being afraid to write about Dawood hold true here.Anyway a good attempt. I hope somebody builds further on it and comes out with more voluminous book."
3,Lost focus,"The book's name is a misnomer. Initially, it talks about how Dawood made his way upto the top in the shady underworld, but then the focus shifts from Dawood to Afganistan, Pakistan, CIA, ISI etc, and ends up in establishing the relationships between these entities. What role Dawood plays or is playing in these tie ups is not mentioned. Only few pages do justice to the book title."
4,Great Songs Docked a Star for Excessive Compression,"great songs from start to finish, but...this disc is EXTREMELY LOUD...mastered using limiting, and designed for Ipods and car stereos...do not play in your bedroom, unless your having a Party, it will rattles your skull"
5,Destinys Child,This is a great CD. I purchased it thru pepsi points. I plan to order from Amazon.com again.
4,DC Rocks!!!!!!!!!,"First of all yall haters out ther that be hatin on Beyonce and them need 2 stop cuz Beyonce works her butt off in the music industrie fo haters like yall to be hatin on her. Da second thing i want 2 say that this album is tight. My favorite songs r:Cater 2 U ,Say my name,Check on it , Jumpin, jumpin, nonono pt2,and more fo my side of the opinion is that i think that it waz a good idea to make a 1s album but i hav 2 ommit that ther were some stupid songs on there like Feel the same way I do wasz one of them crazy songs that i couldnt stan, so yall customers that r buying this album please do not listen 2 that song it might make u sick!!!!!!"
4,Pretty satisfied,"Great organizer, the threads don't get all tangled up like they do when I try to store them other ways. Just don't try to force too many into the organizer at once, otherwise you'll end up with a mess of bobbins on the floor."
4,Sewing designs on cards.,Friends are using this product to tote left-over threads to a craft meeting to sew designs on cards. It is light-weight and can be easily tossed into one's tote. There are plastic ones out there that could crack or spill so I give this one four stars for its usefullness.
5,Mine has the magnetic pin holder in the center,"And when I saw it, I knew I NEEDED it. I keep this next to my main sewing machine, so my bobbins are always handy and I can place the pins on the magnet as I'm sewing. The bobbins don't fall out, and they don't unwind. Whoever invented this little item is a genius. Great gift for anyone who cites sewing as a hobby or business. Even if you have one, you can always use another!"
5,Wonderful Invention,"Wish I had bought more than one. Works exactly as it said. I was skeptical, sure wish I had bought more than one."
1,haven't got this one yet...,"I actually FORGOT I ordered this DVD, but now that I check, I haven't received it yet. Ironically the item is titled ""No Reason To Complain"", so in the spirit of, whatever, I'm not going to.But seriously guys, where's my DVD?"
1,Absolutely Horrible,"I watch a lot of stand-up comedy and this by far has to be one of the worst I've ever seen. The jokes are all old and stale.Oswalt opens with a few lines about midgets. At this point, while these jokes weren't particularly hilarious, the show looked to have promise. It was all down hill from there.He jokes about President Bush, and for as much as I can't stand Bush, hasn't it been overdone by now (or politics in general for that matter)? And then there's the baby jokes, which even though cliche', are usually still a bit funny. However, this guy manages to make them not-so.I know I've seen Oswalt somewhere in the past before and it wasn't this terrible. However, this performace will be burned forever into my mind as a comedy atrocity."
2,"Comedy Central, listen up","Patton Oswalt is funny and my two stars is not because of his performance. It's because of Comedy Central mangling the DVD version.The show was originally broadcast on Comedy Central, and as such it was cut down to about 40 minutes so it could fill a one-hour time slot with commercials.The DVD has the original show, and then in the bonus section, it has ""deleted scenes,"" which are the parts of the full-length concert that were cut for time.So, you can watch the time-edited show, or you can watch the out-of-context segments that were taken out. But what you can't do, and what I have to think any chimpanzee able to use sign language would know you would want to do, is see the original full-length show in its entirety.So, cheers for Patton, boos for CC. I won't be buying the DVD and that's why."
2,not so great,"Big fan of Patton Oswalt. At least I have all his CDs and know them well.For some reason, though, I wasn't aware of this: an early DVD of his. It was unclear whether I already had the material but under a different name, but I ordered it anyway.Answer to my question? Sort of: if you have his other 4 CDs, you have about 70% of this material already. The rest I had never heard, but wasn't so great. Not great enough to justify buying this, at any rate."
5,Pure tarab and ya salaam,Relax and listen to the traditional tarab and enjoy the sophisticated music of old days....The style is pure...uncontaminated and truly simple... It is pleasing to the mind and senses....This CD is the best i've ever heard while experiencing and enjoying the originality of Middle Eastern tarab....Much obliged to the artist for the enchantment and the ecstasy.
4,Great Keepsake Boxes,"I asked for and received this for Christmas. It is a really cute set, and it would be a great gift for a baby shower or a first birthday. The only thing wrong is that the little blue box (that says Mud Pie) was a little beat up and the lining was ripped a little. The boxes for the hair and tooth are small, which isn't a problem for the tooth, but it may not hold a lot of hair. All in all, I'm happy with it and glad I have something that looks really nice to display these keepsakes."
4,Overall good read,"I am a home brewer. Much of what is in the book I will never use. I knew this going into the book, but I am interested in the theoretical side of brewing. It gives a good introduction into the various tests that can be performed on raw materials, wort, and finished product. Recommended for brewers."
2,Another low brow brewing book,If you are a begging brewer wanting to learn to mash this book is good but there are a lot more books out there that either cover more begging issues.This book is simple and short!
3,Are they out there or already here,"I bought this because my copy on V.H.S.has seen it's better days.As far as a review is concerned that is almost impossible you must make up your own mind about what he says.To me there are parts that are just quite unbelievable,but Bob has told the same story for all these years it's a cheap D.V.D.so buy it and listen, and hear for yourself."
2,Not enough detail,"I wonder about Bob Lazar's credibility, however the video doesn't provide enough detail in order to determine the authenticity of what he claims."
1,Bob Lazar empiraclly proved fraud.,"Bob Lazar has been proved to be a fraud by Stanton Friedman and others. He hold no degrees from ANY university, much less MIT. No record exists, and schools DO have records that not even the U.S. government can expunge. I've been to Area 51, sorry no UFO base of aliens, more like secret teat facility for so called ""black"" projects, like the former secret F-117 Stealth fighter (saw one myself fly over my head while at Area 51), B-2 Stealth bomber, Preditor drone, and new Aurora."
1,the second rock n roll swindle,"this cd, as well as this band is not the ""return"" of rock, which unless you couldn't pull yourself away from radio mainstream garbage, never went away. i actually will give them the one star for effort though, they've definately studied their schtick, but it all comes down to feeling and these guys are about as bland as it gets in the ""new rock"" genre. if you really want to get down with garage music with soul, here's what i'd recommend:the dirtbombs- ultraglide in black (in the red)the real pills- nine long years (mortville)thee headcoats- headcoats down (damaged goods)calypso king and the soul investigators- soul strike (soul fire)the embrooks- our new day (voxx)rock on young soldiers."
4,Well Well Well....,"The Mooney Suzuki is another great band from NYC. They are high energy, explosive and cocky as well. Although this album doesnt give off as good of an example of their attitude as their first album, People Get Ready, it is an excellent buy. Each song is a gem in their own right and the heart-wrenching ballad The Broken Heart is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard. Sammy James Jr. is a very soulful man, and he might as well be a preacher because he has given me faith in Rock'n'Roll many'o'times."
2,"Not Bad, Not Great","One of the benefactors of the New Hype is this NYC quartet. On their second release, Electric Sweat, The Mooney Suzuki stomp on the shoulders of rock giants. MC5, Rolling Stones, The Who, The Kinks - all are in attendance in these ten cuts of varying power and effectiveness. I like their energy and enthusiasm, especially on the mewling title track, but recoil from Sammy James Jr.'s sub-Hendrix echo-chamber of a voice. They're derivative: big deal. I just wish this record didn't sound like it was recorded in 1969 and lost in a vault until now."
5,People get ready for The Mooney Suzuki!,"As musical trends change (and we know they do), we find ourselves immersed in a sea of faceless ""garage rock"" bands. Apart from the few that have gotten major radio airplay, most are just sound-alikes. Not so with the Mooney Suzuki. They combine the strut of Jagger with the musical know-how of the Who and the reckless disregard for personal safety of Iggy Pop, with songs that rock even today's jaded audience's socks off. If you want to see a show that's exciting, energetic(understatement of the century), and will leave you wanting more, go see the Mooneys in concert. Jump on the bandwagon now, before they start selling out arenas!!"
3,Pretty Good CD but Brilliant Live,"I saw MS live after hearing their CD and was blown away. The tongue- in-cheek rock star strut they all do on stage (along with chanting ""we're number 1!"") left me dazed and amused. They are no Yeah Yeah Yeahs (or Drunken Boat) but they know how to rock with abandon. Lovely, but more lovely live."
3,Ok,"I dont think this album is as strong as People Get Ready. The title song is very uncomfortable to listen to. Bad vocals lyrics, and a very pedestrian rock riff. The lyrics on this album hve a lot to be desired as well. And the drumming is weak. But there are several good songs to found. ""In a Young Mans Mind"" and ""Oh Sweet Susannah"" being the two strongest. I even dig ""Electrocuted Blues"". I enjoy the live show, but i must say the weakest part of their act is when they did songs off this album. These guys just aren't an album band. keep rockin!!!!"
3,Craig's themes are getting shallower,"As has been the case with all the Vinyard mysteries, Philip Craig continues to entertain with plots that are located in an area that many of us love and easily indentify.Unfortunately, the characters and plots are getting weaker with each new mystery. There is less development and interaction.And for those of us who also enjoyed the fish tales, they seem to have disappeared as well.I still enjoyed the novel and will continue to watch for new spins, hoping they improve."
3,Another trip to Martha's Vineyard,"J. W. Jackson goes clamming with his son Joshua and is horrified when he returns home and finds that his wife, Zee, and daughter Diana have been attacked by two thugs. Zee, who is an accomplished target shooter, has used her skills to defend herself and Diana. The thugs are looking for Jackson's ex-wife's current husband, Tom Rimini. Soon the ex-husband shows up seeking help from J. W., and inexplicably the Jacksons oblige by hiding him in a friend's home. This one stretches credibility as J. W. takes it upon himself to help the husband of someone he still has feelings for, and solves the mystery as to why the mob is looking for Rimini in the first place. He alternates between being a househusband and then somewhat foolishly chasing after the bad guys without benefit of his friends on the police force. A visit to Martha's Vineyard is always pleasant but this is not the best book of the series."
3,JW is out of his usual character,"The story is intriguing (why is JW's ex-wife's husband hiding on the Vineyard?) but fails to deliver a big finish. What really disappointed me was JW's character flaws, as exhibited toward his ex-wife and some of the harsh words he had with his kids. Zee performs admirably, becoming an early heroine in the story, yet torn in her soul over what she had to do. Much of the mystery regarding Tom Rimini, Sonny Whelen, Graham, and Grace was somewhat fun to think about during the unfolding of the story, but the ending was a wimper, rather than the bang I was wanting."
2,Low Tide,"After a great start, this ones slows to a crawl and gets tedious. The ending would work, if we believe all the characters are reasonable people, but they aren't. Strangely passive ending. I'll come back, but might not stay much longer."
4,If you like Dream Theater you'll like Threshold,"In between rock and heavy,they sound very similar to Dream Theater.Good vocals and great musicians."
2,Bach through rose-tinted glasses,"Some people approach this music emotionally and that's fine. I am in the other camp where I listen to it architecturally, i.e. the line, the phrasing, the implied counterpoint, &c., and let the emotions sink in later. In this sense this recording is not successful. You cannot doubt Perlman's technique and tone, but his very free take on phrasing and rhythm means the implied counterpoint is distorted and weakened, and the musical structure is obscured. Perlman's uniformly sweet and rich tone also means he does not distinguish among the independent voices of the implied counterpoint, and instead runs them together. The vibrato which he uses throughout also softens the musical phrasing as the articulations cannot be as sharp. The performances sounds very much like how the cadenzas of 19th century violin concertos are played, which does not happen to jive with my ideas of Bach."
2,"Credible performance, mediocre recording...","A good performance but nothing to get excited about...really mediocre recording -- sounds as though it was either recorded in a large hallway or with a lot of added reverb...particularly annoying is Perlman's bow noise -- almost every stroke starts with an annoying ""crunch""...better recording and performance from Szeyng."
1,Choose: Vibrato or Bach?,"If you want to listen to vibrato that sounds like a tortured cat, get this. If you are actually interested in listening to Bach and want to hear an ""authentic"" recording, get a version that's played on a baroque violin by a baroque violinist."
4,Coming of Age: Rarely Herd is one fine Bluegrass group,"I have been a Bluegrass fan (nut) for 30 years, and the Rarely Herd has become one of my favorites. Catch the group live somewhere...The Coming of Age CD is a keeper! I listen to it in my car (actually pickup) all the time. The music is upbeat and new, but still has the traditional sound; their harmony is supurb. ""Ain't No Way to Go"" is a foot stomper, and :""Cecil Barfield"" plays those Georgia Blues is fun; it's only too bad the CD was cut prior to Ned Luberecki (banjo & guitar) joining the group; he adds a dimension to this song with 3-finger guitar blues pickin'...not on this CD though. ""Love Please Come Home"" will be a favorite of the fans of Reno & Smiley"", with son Don Wayne Reno playing his dad's banjo. Buy it and enjoy: I sure do."
1,Not for me,It could be okay for some peaple but not for me. It's at a verylow price so I could get it for my uncle (a minister). I think it'sgood you have it available becuase usually you wouldn't find a booklike this at such a cool book store! Thankyou for reading my review.
2,Star Trek: Mere Anarchy,"I would have left out the word 'Mere' because as Star Trek goes it is unfortunately too descriptive. I never managed to finish the book, it is boring and the switches between authors strongly suggest that they did not read what came before in the book. Maybe it is because the world they choose was boring, or that it was not written as a book, but as a series of e-books, I have no idea why, but I did waste my money on this one.Linda Sheean"
2,"Not one of the better ""pre-Wayne"" Wanye films.","Paradise Canyon (Carl Pierson, 1935)Another pre-Stagecoach John Wayne Lone Star short, this one with Wayne playing John Wyatt, an undercover marshal trying to get to the bottom of a counterfeiting ring by infiltrating a medicine show run by the ringleader's old partner, who's gone as legit as a medicine show mogul can be. It's relatively amusing, though the medicine show scenes tend to be far too long, killing any pace the movie might have built up. But then you don't watch these for their great stories, timeless direction, etc.; you watch them to get a feel for John Wayne before he was John Wayne. **"
4,A provisional recommendation,"I bought this CD set because I had enjoyed so much the LP recording of ""Orpheus in the Underworld"" I bought back in the seventies. I had assumed the other two operas would be as enjoyable, but they were a disappointment. However, the CDs are worth buying just for ""Orpheus"" - hilariously funny libretto, great melodies, and glorious singing from the Sadler's Wells cast. Just a pity that Offenbach seems to have run out of ideas when he wrote the other two."
3,Neck Strap vs Armband,"I ordered my muvo tx from Amazon and it came with the neck strap rather than the arm band. Kudos to Amazon's painless return policy and very responsive customer service.Creative has three versions of this product. The European has the belt clip, the Japanese versions have the neck strap and the U.S. version has the arm band and clip.It seems if your order comes from JandR than you get version with the arm band."
5,Pretty Cool Unit..,I bought this at Christmas to have something that I could take to the gym. I was sold on its size. I had started shopping for a mini iPod but opted to go this route as the size was much smaller. I only want it for the gym and didn't see the need for a unit any larger. The built in FM radio was a nice feature as well.What I also liked was that it can operate on a standard AAA battery and I didn't need to send it back in like the iPod to get a battery replacement. Battery life is long on your standard alkaline batteries.No special cables needed to transfer data which I thought was another positive. I am forever misplacing cables and there always seems to be so many of them for each gadget or device that you own. This is pretty self contained in that respect and I'm very happy with it.
1,Save what lives?,"""mysteriously my CD4 T cells count reached 255/ul of blood and CD4/CD8 ratio of 0.6. These are the hallmarks for AIDS. I was tested for the HIV three times and the results were always the same, ""negative"". I really would like to know what doctor diagnosed that as AIDS. An AIDS diagnosis requires a positive Western Blot or Elisa HIV test. Whithout that, you cannot give an AIDS diagnosis. It's no ""mystery"" that neither of the two below are MDs..."
4,Stylistic romp,"You know - I've always found it odd that the few, the proud, the wierd, who share my literary tastes have never even heard of J.P. Donleavy. While the Ginger Man will always be hard to beat, Destinies isn't far behind. It takes about ten seconds to become hopelessly addicted to Donleavy's style and about five seconds to fall in love with Darcy Dancer and his adventures. Just a wonderful, wonderful novel from one of the most under-appreciated writers of our time."
5,The Destinies of Darcy Dancer Gentleman,"This was the second Donleavy novel I read back in 1980. Since then I have read all of his novels and biographies. This book is also the reason that i stayed at the Shelbourne Hotel.Full of gratuitous sex, violence drunken ribaldry, indeed it is almost a training manual for students.It opens the door to positive thinking and instils in one that when things are really bad, they are not as bad as they are going to get, but never give up.Learn negotiating skills, if a fist in the gob doesn't work, buy your man a drink.Sex education, from aristocrats, whores, artists, teachers, plebean masses.In all an excellent life changing book in which Donleavy displays true comic genius and has caused me hours of laughter."
4,"Arrived a little battered, but on time.","This is VERY hard to find, so I was grateful to find what looked like the last one on the Internet. It is a gift and the outer box is battered at the edges, but otherwise it's find. Arrived very quickly and well-packaged. All in all, just fine."
5,my favorite all time,I love Samsara..it is so very very nice...it's sexy...and I get a lot of compliments and a lot of..OHHHH you smell sooo good :)
5,Amazing,I loved this book and found it so easy to relate to and understand where the author was coming from.
5,"A Boy's Own Story, continued","A continuation of A Boy's Own Story, this book is no less well written and no less brilliant. It is no wonder that White is considered--by the worthy, literate critics, at least--the finest gay writer in America. I would modify that to say he is one of the finest writers (gay or otherwise) in the world today. This book cronicles the life of ABOS from shortly after that book leaves off through the Stonewall riots in New York in June of 1969. The narrator's growth is evident from the end of the last novel through the end of this one. This is one of the most important works by one of our most important writers; White is the nearest writer to Proust to write since, though minus the cork-lined apartment and with quite a few more social graces."
3,Interesting learning experience,"The author apparently wrote this book over a long period, while making a living on other writings. As a result, his style was inconsistent and labored in much of the book. His frequent, if not constant references to sometimes obscure literature suggested he was giving the reader a look into another, more literate world than most of us inhabit, which was interesting. His experiences while living abroad were a good vicarious experience for the reader, though the fact that his entire experience seemed submerged in the gay world made it difficult to identify with much of what he was saying, though again, perhaps it was an important vicarious learning experience for most readers."
3,"Short, but good first book","I was a little disappointed that the book is so short and not as ""complex"" as the books we normally read our daughter. It is a very simple book with one short sentence per page. Our daughter does enjoy it very much and is able to read along with us, so it would make an excellent beginning reader's book."
5,They love it!,"My 18 month old twins insist on having this book read to them over and over. Yes, it does get boring, but I have all their books memorized anyway, and repitition is how toddlers learn. What they really like are all the kisses. They both make kissing sounds when I read it, and when it's done everyone gets kisses (including me) before I hear ""more!"" They are also able to read along, identifying familiar objects on the pages (bear, car, etc.)."
5,Great anytime story,"It's a great book to read for an infant or toddler. My son is two and enjoys looking at the pictures and listening to the story. Conceptually, the ideas are very simple but also incredibly important. Showing affection through different kinds of kisses is a great story to share with a child. The short text allows me to point to the text as I read without losing my son's attention, then I embellish the story with sounds and gestures that make it a lot of fun for both of us. My two year old loves books and has a mountain of them. This is certainly one of his favorites."
4,Great show - but they shouldn't let Matt & Trey talk before,"I think the show is really great, but they shouldn't let Matt & Trey talk at the beginning of every episode.I really loved most of the shows on the DVD set. I especially like Cartman with his ""Screw you guys, I'm going home"" & ""Respect my authority"". I also like Mr. Hanky the Christmas Poop. The school counselor is also funny with his ""Drugs are bad. OK. Alcohol is bad. OK"" South Park is a pretty [messed up] town, I guess that's what makes it so funny.Matt & Trey should stick to making the show and not appear at the beginning of every show with ""This is our favorite show"" ... The people who put out these DVDs should put their commentaries in the special features or put in chapters so we wouldn't have to have to watch them with their boring jokes, we could skip them."
4,1 of the best,This season of south park is very funny with some great episodes. Would have been nice to have more extras (commentrys etc.) but the documentary is fine and the intros are very funny. Highly recommended!
4,solid comedy,"South Park: Season 2 has solid comedy and originality. For me, there are not as many laugh out loud moments as there are in Season 1, which had some impeccable comedic timing. The stories in Season 2 have great social irreverence, and also many dadaesque elements. Fans of Season 1 should be right at home. Reviewed 5/25/2009 after watching instantly the entire season."
4,The best show ever seen,"Well this tv show is so good cos if you like family guy and simpson's you'll love this cartoons too, you can enjoy this 4 guys and all kinds of things they do every single day, the only thing that is not so good is that you can only enjoy a few episodes from this season but its really fun and you wont get burried i really recomend you guys enjoy it"
2,Classics,"Why does DM keep releasing the same songs over and over again? :( No more 'classics', please!"
4,Golf Clubs for Budding Enthusiasts,My boys started hitting off the tee by their grandparents' house out in Pennsylvania and love it. When we go to the golf course they didn't have much selection for kids so I thought why not get them their own for Christmas. They love them. My older is 8 and the clubs are fine and he has room to grow into them. My younger is five and although the clubs say 5-12 they were still a little big but workable.Very happy with the product for its price.
2,"Good, but not recommended.","2.5 stars -I've been an Ambrosia fan since the 70's and agree with other reviewers that this release falls short without Pack. Musicianship and sound quality are good but I prefer listening to the originals. I'm sorry to say that this one probably won't get much play in the future.That being said, if this lineup came to town I would consider seeing them. It would be a fine live show, IMO.Instead of purchasing ""Live at the Galaxy Theatre"" I'd recommend you complete your Ambrosia collection and/or get Pack's ""The Secret of Movin' On"" and ""Unborn""."
2,With or without you David,"If you like your live CD's to live up to the studio version then this CD will both satisfy and frustrate. The band is very tight, the players all very professional but and this is a big but, without original guitarist and principal songwriter David Pack (a unique and irreplaceable vocalist) this is largely an unsatisfying disc."
2,Insipid.,"Even though the musicianship is tight and well played this album lacks any real flavor or enthusiasm. I've been an Ambrosia fan since their first album and have been waiting for a live set since then but ""Live at the Galaxy"" sounds like they are merely trying to squeeze out a couple of bucks off of their name."
1,"PACK it in guys, you need PACK ....UPDATED","Jerry: You dont know ANYTHING about their music, w/o pack they are as worthless as you are as a reviewer........Sorry Ambrosia fans, this is WORTHLESS w/o David.Dont waste your money."
5,Ambrosia LIVE,"This new live album reassures myself that this band will be around for many more years. The quality is amazing and the songs are staples in rock history. I attended the CD release party at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano, and I was mezmerized that these blokes still put on a great show and sing better than ever before. So...if you're an Ambrosia fan or a fan of good rock music...this album is a must have!!!Those A&R; folks at Coach House Records really know what they are doing! Bravo!"
5,Awesome Live CD,Ambrosia captured live what a great CD. The quality of thisrecording is truly amazing. This is one of the best live CD thati have ever heard. This is a must have CD for all Ambrosia fans.
4,emotional intelligence is no fantasy,"Conrad, once again, out does himself with his insights into the human psyche. Second only to ""Heart of Darkness,"" this thrilling short novel delves deep into the protaganists mind and leaves the reader questioning his own capabilities. Fanatstic character developement defines this piece of work and his constant reference to the main characters similarities keeps the reader thinking with every turn of the page. Conrad is able to capture human emotions in a clear manner that is normally hard to articulate. A brilliant novel that left me wanting more..."
1,Uninteresting and Dreadful,"I'm sorry, but this book is much too full of description and symbolism. If you juxtapose it to other short stories, I'm sure you will notice the negative difference. My advice is: Do not buy this book!! Find another one - you will enjoy it more! When you unpack the story, you'll find that the first paragraph is full of description about an empty ocean, all mysterious and strnage. Other settings are a ship deck and an L-shaped cabin. I think I need not say any more - this book is dreadful!"
5,Samuel Ramey is a great artist!,"This recording shows Samuel Ramey in excellent form. He sings superbly in each aria. The Verdi arias tend to lack the last bit of emotional abandon, but Ramey sings them very well. A few arias allow us to hear his voice's excellent agility. Ramey has excellent Italian and French diction. The ""Calunnia"" aria is right up his alley. A particularly nice surprise was the short selection from ""La Damnation de Faust"". Samuel Ramey can sing and it is no wonder why he became a major operatic superstar."
2,No just no,Crappy in all aspects. Yes it works but just crappy built. No seal to keep it water tight. Hose it two short. Clip is week. Plastic is junk.
2,REALITY AND PRODUCT DESCRIPTION,"The product description of THE LANDUAGE OF DREAMS explains that this is a series of dvds but in such an unclear way, that the unwary reader may be led to believe that several (or indeed all) would be supplied under this general title. Instead, only one dvd is supplied. This dvd, although worthy in itself, is not really worthy of its excessive purchase price."
5,Great product,"This was a great purchase, you get two products in one. I used to have to carry the usb cable, the video cable and software cd if I wanted to download and/or view my photos on someone else's computer or TV. Now I just take pictures with the SD card in my camera, take it out, put it in the USB reader, plug it into a computer or a video device with USB capability, and I can view and download my pictures without a hassle. Plus an 8 Gb card allows me to take over a thousand pictures without having to empty it out. I also use it at work, for transfering files from one computer to another, and for keeping computer drivers, utilities, software, etc."
4,Good overview of testing,I used this book to prepare for the ISEB exam. It is a good overview of testing but not thorough enough to properly prepare you for the exam.
2,Hmmmmmmm.....,"In these pages are sown the seeds of the myth of the ""liberal media"". When you're far enough west, everything looks like it's east."
1,PLEASE SEND THE ITEM BY POST,PLEASE I WANT YOU TO SEND THE ITEM BY POST BECAUSE IT IS VERY DEFFICULT TO GET THE YOU HAVE BOUGHT
4,good,"covers fundamentals well, easy to read, good variety of problems, historic sections are interesting"
3,Bathtub transfer bench too big,"The bench was too big for me. My weight is 100 pounds, the bench seems to be made for a person much bigger than me. I had first to try the bench in order to see how difficult was for me to use. The company did not accept to do a change.I am not going to buy through the internet this kind of products in the future."
3,bath tub transter benth,it nice but couldn't use it because the water run off seat and on to the floor. it got here very fast
5,"Favorite Movie, GIANT Poster","Rushmore has been my favorite all-time movie since it came out. It would take a short novel to describe how much I identify with the characters, setting, and writing. I've always wanted a nice framed poster from this film and I hope to secure a Schwartzman autograph one day. Great seller, great shipping."
4,"A magnificent account, but difficult to read","For a student of geology, this is an excellent book, but for the average reader it is entirely too technical and detailed. Even as a chemical engineer who frequently reads scientific journals, this reader found the book to be a struggle. Still, it provides superb insight into the real world of scientific discovery, showing how personal interactions, circumstance, and serendipity play critical roles. It was well worth reading in its entirety. The author has obviously gone to great lengths to produce a thorough account of how reversals in the earth's magnetic field, dated by radioactive decay, came to be understood and used to prove seafloor spreading and continental drift."
5,"Great book, can't put it down.","This book is a collection of 20 short real-life stories that took place in India. The stories are about street children, women, tribal homeless and destitute people and those living with leprosy and HIV. These stories show the spirit of human beings to overcome insurmountable difficulties with courage, resilience, optimism, humanism, and hope. This is a great read, specially for those in ""developed countries"", it gives a powerful and gripping insight into the lives of unfortunate people. Read this to understand how crippling poverty, discrimination, illiteracy, etc. can be, and the human being's determination to seek a better life in the face of these enormous suffering.The previous reviewer complained about the grammar, the grammar is indeed wrong at few places, but, it's not too bad to make the reading/understanding the stories impossible."
3,Not bad required reading,"The book was interesting, it showed the lives of many Indians and they're struggle to survive in poverty or their struggles with harsh racism. The author writes in a very conversational manner, which makes it easy to read. On the downside it leaves you with many Indian words with no definitions, and many acroynms for positions that you;ve never heard of, and there is no explanation of the heirachy. He also has horrible grammar, and apparently no editor seemed to notice, it made me want to hit my head against a wall. If you have to read it then don't worry, if you want to read it then I hope you like graphic stories of poverty."
3,a 12 year old`s point of view/a girl name lydia,"this story is kind of hard to follow. also, when i was reading it, it said there was some kind of error, so when ever there`s supposed to be talking marks or things like that, it would show a question mark in a box. after a while it would get very annoying to try to read around it. otherwise i thought it was a good book and it had some very funny parts. i have already downloaded the rest of the minnie`s pets series so i can keep on reading!"
1,A not so Groovy Cd,"Diarrhea. That's what happened to me when I heard this cd, massivley explosive diarrhea, but luckily when I had realized I was out of toliet paper, I could use the cd to clean up, and trust me it didn't sound any better afterwards. If I could find out where my dog buried, and clean it off, I would probably send it back to amazon, wait, it's not worth the shipping charge, even if there is no charge it's not worth it."
1,Bad reviews are right,"Well, the bad reviews of this CD are very right, this is pretty bad. I apologize to the people who made this CD, and the people who listened to it, for wasting your time! Good luck getting somewhere with this"
1,This blows,"All of the good reviews titled ""a music fan"" are all members of the band promoting thier own cd. If you buy this CD and actually enjoy it, you should see a doctor because you may have an inner ear infection. The rythms are completely off and stolen from Dave Matthews Band, Strangefolk, String Cheese Incident, DBB and the list goes on. Above all DO NOT BUY THIS CD. If you would like something worthwhile to do with ten dollars then throw it out your car window just like you will do to this CD. Or just light the money on fire because at least that will keep you warm."
1,Not worth it,This CD is really bad...even though the bass player (Alexis Babini) is extremely hot the CD sounds like the same song over and over again its really really really bad!!! Sorry guys!
1,how is this considered music?,"I wonder if they know what rythem or a beat is? I have been playing music for 8 years now and I can't even imagine how they wrote this piece of garbage. Garbage is actually praising this CD because it seriously is worse than my dog's vomit. Buy a metronome so you can keep a f**king beat. This isn't anything new or experimental. It's just atrocious.Also, write some better lyrics and find a better singer. Babini is really flat half the time. My dog can vomit better lyrics and sing better than whats on this CD. Well, at least now I can use this CD to clean up my dog's vomit. Dont buy this because it is just a 10 dollar paper towel.In the end, you can't even burn this CD well because the plastic fumes can kill you. Maybe someone can burn it in front of this band so they never again will produce such crap."
1,Are you joking?,"Are you serious, people? I am a very intelligent critic of the performing arts and let me tell you, this is absolutely disgusting. If you put John Mayer and Dave Mathews band along with ""Gabriel's Groove"", i am sure you will see the exact similarity that makes this band not individualists but people trying to form a band out of something that has already been made. Dave Mathews is a musical genius, Gabriel's Groove on the other hand is not. If i could prevent people from buying this CD i would, but unfortunately I cannot. 5 stars? Please, this needs to stop, and stop while we're ahead."
1,Needs work.,"I came across this band while searching for some good new music on Amazon, and it's not quite what I was looking for. The free sample named ""Mary Goes Round"" was simply horrible. The lyrics sound like a hormone enraged dorky highschool student couldn't get over how his father thinks he's a faliure. Well guess what bud, if you keep pursuing this career, maybe he's right.The sound is almost Dave Mathew's Band-esque, only worse. Maybe if you seperate each instrument and played them as solos it would make sense, but the correlation and fit between them is... it isn't.I'm sorry that you spent whatever money you did developing the band and burning cds in your basement. I'm sorry that you will never earn that money back through music.Please excuse me, I need to vomit."
5,Great Product,"This is a great product for dog owners and car owners. I just bought a new car and wanted to cover the back seat to keep it clean, problem was car seat covers were to thin and too much work to take off and clean. Then I found this product Kozy K-9 car seat covers, they feel more like a blanket, really nice and look good too. Easy on and off with non slip backing. Machine washable also."
2,"Overheats, vaccuming takes forever!","I purchased this at another store, and I wish I had read the reviews ahead of time. My mom sang the praises of her smaller shark, and I decided to purchase one. After a few minutes it overheats and is useless. The safety feature causes the periods where you CAN vaccuum to be way too short. I actually have to vaccuum the rest of the house with another vaccum. DO NOT RECOMMEND this if you a busy professional, as the overheating is very annoying."
1,Save your money,"I have had nothing but problems with this particular vacuum. I live in a small apartment and it does not get very dirty. However, this vacuum cleaner will shut itself off after only 10 minutes of use. To re-start it I have to turn off, un-plug, and wait 45 minutes to start it up again. I have spoken to others who have had this same problem and tried to send it to the company for repairs under the warranty. It would cost them more to ship it than the vacuum cost in the first place. It's a terrible product, so do not waste your money."
2,Stinks,"Purchased this vacuum to replace a bissell that stunk. This vacuum was great at first, great suction, picked up alot of the dog hair my other vacuum missed. Easy to empty but then if the filters are not cleaned after every vacuum the vacuum losses suction. Then there is the problem of if you use it to long it shuts off and you have to wait for it to cool down I geuss in order for it to turn on again. Needless to say I returned it and got my money back."
2,"Ok, but buy a Dyson instead","I purchased this vacuum several years ago and after one year, sold it to someone else for 40 dollars.... I went out and bought a Dyson instead at a considerably higher price. The vacuum has a very cheap plastic feel and although it tries to mimic the design of a Dyson, it is all looks no substance. Suction was ok. I did like the light on the front of it though and thought that was a good idea. In the end do yourself a favor spend more money on a better quality unit."
1,Annoying Shut Off,"I have had this vacuum for four years. When it is working, it is wonderful. But that's the rub. It simply doesn't work very long. It has an emergency overheating shutoff. So you don't get to do too much vacuuming before it quits. My advice is to try something else. It is annoying feature and there is no way to judge how long it will work. This Shark bit me bad."
2,Hunk o' junk,"This was the best thing since sliced bread for about 4 months. Then it entered a slow and steady decline. It overheats, smells like it's burning, and the suction is laughable...or would be laughable I guess if I wasn't so ticked off at the effort I have to put in to vacuuming one little area rug. I think my husband and I got caught up in the marketing when we purchased this. I wish we had done better research."
1,Worst Vacuum ever!!,"I have had this vacuum for a couple of years now, and it has been completely un-usable from the start. It shuts down after 1 or 2 rooms, and you have to wait a few hours. Cleaning it is a pain, as you have to take the cannister completely apart and dust is in everything. I will only purchase a bag type vacuum in the future, bagless is just not worth the hassle, and this Shark Pursuit is an extreemly poor design."
2,VERY Poor Suction - Especially if you Have Pets,"I purchased this vacuum after returning 2 Bissell Clean View II units where the beater bar locked up and melted. Although this vacuum has not had that problem, it is relatively WORTHLESS for basic vacuuming. I wonder if the folks at Euro-Pro even attempted to vacuum pet hair or anything else with it? You have to pass over something 3, 4 or 5 times to pick up visible debris - can you imagine what it is leaving behind deep in the carpet? The ONLY nice feature is the ability to turn off the beater bar when you are using the tool attachment, which I should add works like a tool attachment should. I have owned this vacuum for about 6 months, and plan on DONATING it to someone who doesn't have a vacuum, as this unit is better then not having one at all! That's not much of a compliment."
1,Complete garbage,"I don't even own this vacuum, luckly. However, I borrowed it from my friend since our own vacuum is beyond help. Obviously, this vacuum doesn't put us in a much better situation. It's complete garbage though, it will last about 3-5 minutes with a mid-way (by the ""full"" line) filled canister, and about 5-10 with it completely empty. I've owned a kenmore that's still kicking strong after 15 years, and this Shark vacuum still has the tags and stickers on it. Going to recommend my friend to return it while she can. Trolls need not bother saying ""WELL CLEAN THE FILTER MORE LOLZ!"", because while that effects how long it's short time span is, it never lasts longer than 10 minutes. It's just a horrible vacuum.Never going to buy from this brand again, and will make sure to pass it on to friends, and obviously you folks.(note: for some reason there are two links for this vacuum, the other being (...)"
2,Disappointed,"I really liked it when I first bought it. It has a cool look. However, just now, I was frightened by it since it suddenly shut off after I have vacummed for 7 min....!I've bought it for 3 months only... please don't die..... I kept pushing the button and it's not working!!!! I read the 1st review here and the person said there's an overheating problem. I didn't know that .... and now I'm pushing the button.... it's on again! Genrally, it's good but please bear the sudden nshut off whenever. you'll never know when it's gonna shut off...!!! Surprise!"
1,Shark Pursuit Vacuum,"This vacuum shuts off after 10 minutes of operation. Than you need to wait 1 hour for it to ""cool"" down. And in the meantime, you need to clean ALL of the filters on the vacuum. Besides the filter in the main canister, there are two other filters that need to be clean. In essance, after cleaning for 10 minutes you need to take the whole vacuum apart to clean all the filters and then wait 1 hour. Plan on a whole day to clean your rugs. It looks pretty though."
1,Can't clean my house fast enough before the overheat cuts off!,"If you keep all the filters clean, you have about four minutes to clean your entire house. It has good suction while it runs, then you have to wait an hour for the overload to reset. I just hate it!!!! I'm going to lay it on the driveway and run my truck over it. What a waste of money and any price. I wish I had my 30 year old Kirby back!"
1,I'm Finding it hard to finish reading this book,"This Is the first Jackie Collins book that I have read. Quite frankly Its is the most unexciting book that I've read. Towards the end of the book, all of a sudden about 5 news characters come into it. All in all about 15 charcters, it can be confusing. I'm very dissapointed by this book, I suppose the ending won't change my point of view.Buy It If you a fan of Jackie's, otherwise its a time waster!"
1,what happened jackie?,"i love to read jackie collins book's and i have liked everyone of them, but for some reason this book is really boaring to me. i expected better. This is book was not as enjoyable to read as her other books, so if this was your first jackie collins book and you didnt like it then i suggest you keep reading because this is her worst."
5,Pure comedy,This movie is one of those that will give you many memorable scenes that you can repeat over and over with your friends and drive your wives/girlfriends crazy.
5,more addictive than gold chains,"I'm Gonna Git U Sucka is the greatest movie of all time. I first saw it when I was in the 4th grade and now, at the ago of 20, it is still the funniest sh** ever to me. Antonio Fargas' performance as ""pimp of the year"" Flyguy is oscar worthy. The film pokes fun/pays tribute to the blaxploitation films of the '70s, such as Shaft and Hammer. Non-stop laughs from begining to end featuring some of today's illest comedians, such as Chris Rock. I don't know how many times I've watched this film, it's gotta be in the thousands, but it never gets old."
3,DVD Im Gonna get you Sucka,"It came in on time and the DVD worked with no scratches. I was concerned that it would be bent, or messed up but it wasn't. I am glad I ordered this."
4,I'M GONNA GIT YOU SUCKA!,"I'M GONNA GIT YOU SUCKA! is a spoof an blaxploitation films of the 1970's. This is the first film written, directed by, and starring Keenen Ivory Wayans. Jack Spade is an Army secretary who returns home to find out that his brother has died of an O.G. (an overdose of gold chains). Jack gathers up an army of some local neighborhood hero's (Bernie Casey, Antonio Fargas, Steve James, Isaac Hayes, and Jim Brown) to help him fight and defeat Mr. Big, the crime lord responsible for his brother's death. This movie has many funny moments, especially one that has Chris Rock making an appearance as a rib joint customer. This is a film for both action and comedy fans! Keenen Ivory Wayans would go on to direct SCARY MOVIE and SCARY MOVIE 2!"
1,DVD did not work!,"Disappointed, DVD, did not work. Returning item. Item arrived on time. I will not be ordering any products from this company again."
5,Hilarious,"I've been quoting foolishness from this movie for years, I finally bought it so my son can be in on the jokes. HAHAHAHAHA!"
3,I ALMOST COULD LOVE THIS MOVIE,"The plot did not make any sense(fighting for gold chains), the characters in the film made the movie funny for me(i.e. Bald-headed girl named Cherry), and the happy ending was classic (man saves girl from the bad man)."
3,I love Blaxploitation...but this was ok,"This film does have some very funny moments like the rib joke but I felt a wee bit let down that the script and story line was not as good as it could have been. It nice to see the old boys back (Hayes,Brown etc...) but where were Pam Grier, Fred Williamson and Richard Roundtree !!....now that would have been excellent. I love Blaxploitation but I wish this was better."
2,average at best and i love 70's culture,as much as i love the 70's and my friends can back that up i wasn't really feeling this film.the Chris Rock line one rib was funny.and Issac Hayes&Jim Brown with the Foot problem scene was funny.Bernie Casey was cool.as was the very underrated Antonio Fargas.but as almost always with Keenen Ivory Wayans what was his message or point? the film tried to do to many things at once.a better version of this film is one that starred Keenen and that was called Hollywood Shuffle directed by Robert Townsend.
1,Not he same as I used in Europe,Quality of this brand I used in Europe was a lot different (much better) that the one I purchased from this place. It's only the name with no charm.
5,An Excellent Story,"The title of this story may confuse the reader till the end, but it is worth the wait. The story is a genuine page-turner, about an elderly widow who takes in a penniless widow as a companion, and the passive-aggressive battle that begins when they cease getting along. It is not a long book so you can read it in a weekend or less. I have read it many times and I always enjoy it. It is one of the kinds of books you never get rid of; you just put it aside for awhile, and can enjoy it again and again."
2,Not worth the money,"An ordinary version of extraordinary music. On the whole, while a fairly nice compilation of Barber's music, it was unfortunately musically disappointing."
5,Heavenly,Slatkin and Barber go hand in hand. This recording will be celebrated for generations to come.
5,GET this disc- it is absolutely phenomenal,"THis CD is worth 10 times its weight in gold. Just get it, get it now, before you have to hear a minute more bad music.It'll play in your head for the rest of your life.What a great investment in your mind.Have you bought it yet?"
1,"Slow, slower, slowest","Longest Adagio, I have ever heard. Endless. Perfect for funerals.The rest is average to say the least."
2,Disappointing,"This video was very basic. It defined the terms used in Parliamentary Procedure (Par Pro); like quorum, main motion, and gave the procedure for voting. It also gave the order of business for a regular meeting. A nice touch was after each section it quizzed the viewers on the main points. However, I had hoped the video would show examples of people using Par Pro and it did not. This video was basically a narrated Power Point presentation. It did not show Parliamentary Procedure in action. It was not worth the money!"
4,great service,I ordered and then received Bob Holt's CD and got it quickly and in good order. I appreciate the prompt delivery! Everything was as described and I'm enjoying the fiddle tunes!
4,For those who love images from written words.,"From the written words, the images that are created in your mind are amazing. The hands of an angel that can turn a dead man's stone heart alive again will bring out the romantic side of you. I lent the book to a friend who never returned it. They didn't want to give it back."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"One of those hybrid sort of books. Throw in fantasy, horror, and a bit of SF, and see what you get. Something like a little of the later Tepper, perhaps. Slightly phantasmagorical, or something like that.Anyway, I didn't find it too compelling, and struggled through the maid's quest for her boss who has been taken by the Darkangel vampire guy."
2,A Stunning Fantasy,I picked this book for a book report and looking at it and thinking it would be a good book but it wasn't I don't even want to finish it. It is soooo boring. Some of it I didn't even understand like what is a day-month? I read a lot of other reviews and I don't think this book deserves 5 stars.Also a lot of the reviews say it's good for adults but my mom read some of it and she didn't even like it.
5,Meredith Ann Pierce is one of the best authors on Earth!,"From the minute I started reading, I knew this was a great book. I loved the author's Ms. Pierce's descriptions of the characters, especially the darkangel and Aeriel. The setting was great too. The book begins with Aeriel and her mistress, Eoduin gathering hornflowers, when suddenly a darkangel (aka icarus) appears and carries Eoduin away to his domain to be his bride. A day or two later Aeriel decides to avenge Eoduin's aduction and goes to the place where she was taken. The icarus soon arrives and just as Aeriel was about to kill him, he unfolds his wings to reveal the most beautiful person Aeriel has ever seen. Then the darkangel carries her off too, also to his domain. There Aeriel serves as a servant and as time passes she knows that she has to kill the icarus before he finds his final bride. To find out what happens, READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!"
5,Five Stars for Darkangel,I love this series! Read it for the first time in high school and never knew that it continues on...Must read again and again and again!
5,Magical tale of redemption and romance,"This is the only book that I have ever delayed finishing, because I loved it so damn much. The storyline is deceptively simple: a young slave seeks revenge for her mistress, abducted by a vampyre, and becomes his servant instead...but like the best stories, there's a lot more to it than that.Aeriel is a heroine who grows on you at the same time as she grows into her own skin. The vampyre, like the best villains, is simultaneously replusive and seductive. And of course, there are the helpers, like the Duarough, the tribespeople, the Pendarlon...It might take you a while to guess where the tale is set. The mythology is rich and left me panting for more. I'm delighted to discover the other books have been published, and will be ordering them as soon as possible."
5,Loved it!,"I read this book back in the eight grade when I was 13, and I truly loved it! Recently, I've sought out for this book for another chance to read it again :) Meredith Ann Pierce is an amazing author, one of the best authors of all time! This story is fantasy, love, and mystery. I enjoyed it lots. I'm really looking forward to reading the sequel to this great story -- highly recommend!"
4,"Good book, but disappointing trilogy","I really loved reading this book, and the two others in the trilogy. However, the ultimate ending to the trilogy was so disappointing that I wish I had never started reading it."
2,How to become a co-dependant racist heroine,"Okay.I LOVE fantasy. Good ones. This isn't badly written and the world is intriguing but Meredith, you should be using your powers for good! Our heroines' skin gets LIGHTER in the sun of Solstar and therefore she is more beautiful? She is only worthy of love when she is tall, fair, blonde, and buxom? She cuts out her own heart and gives it to the vampire? Okay, what is up with that? That works? Not that I have noticed. Young girls should not be reading this. Oh sure, his ex-wives are all wraiths but I, with my superior blonde hair and light skin and big heart, will SAVE this woman strangling, soul-stealing man. Girls and women who have fallen under the spell of this book: Run! Male liars, alcoholics, and wife beaters who can suck a women's soul dry: sorry to have to tell you this but you should really save yourselves.1 extra star for the good spinning scenes and Lyon battles."
1,HORRIFIED by the ending,"This is a beautifully written fairy tale that teaches young girls to stick by evil, animal and women abusing men because there may be that ""small spark of good""...and even die for them if necessary. I cannot believe how horrifying the end is. THINK PEOPLE. Just because someone writes something amazingly well does not mean that the message is a good one. Enough of this beauty and the beast trash. Too many women in this world are sticking by ""monsters"", waiting for that little, tiny spark of good to surface. What a shame that this much talent was used to foster such a dangerous, tired message."
2,Great....but utterly AWFUL!,"The book starts off slow and ends abruptly. The plot inches along slowly, but the language and the characters enticing you to read more...until finally you're at the end...and that's it. The end is short and sloppy. After I read this book I was very angry that a book could be left in such a place...so many loose ends. How was that done again? - She did WHAT? Very sloppy...but the story its self demands to be read. If you can stand your own anger at the ending...the book is decent enough."
1,dry and monotoneous story line,"This book is terribly over rated, not at all worth 5 stars! The only appealing thing was the darkangel, him and his looks. Aeriel was unbelievably common, nothing interesting about her. A simple book for simple minds."
1,As deadly as having your soul sucked dry...,"Upon reading the positive reviews I borrowed a copy of this book, for I am a fan of Amelia Atwater-Rhodes's fantasy novels. Sigh. What can I say? The plotline is so predictable that I wondered if Aeriel has terribly weak logic to not see Darkangel IS the Prince Irrylath Dirna drowned in the lake. She is not very likable, the story is oddly bland and lacks in real action, drama, and passion. I suggest reading Amelia Atwater-Rhodes' ""Hawksong"" to get more kicks than this dry thing."
3,AVERAGE YA FANTASY NOVEL,"After all the rave reviews, I was surprised. The Darkangel was not at all what I had expected from reading the reviews. I just didn't like the author's shady way of letting us know/guess what was in the main character's head. Overall, not worth 5 stars, it was just another average YA fantasy novel."
4,4.5 stars,"This book may not appeal to the modern-day YA reader, but, then again, since that's me...maybe it will. Haha! Anyway, it's definitely darker and ""heavier"" than most of today's YA fantasy, but I loved it. I loved the whole series. I loved watching the main character grow, and I loved that it wasn't just superficial or written for max sales. It's realistic and different. This book feels like actual literature."
5,Favorite,One of my favorite books as a young adult. I had to reread them all and still as excellent as I remember them
4,Fun Fantasy Reading,I very much enjoyed this book--stayed up all night reading it in fact! It was a good dark fantasy (I think that's fun). I can't wait to get to the other books in the series.
2,Well-written but superficial...,"I was perhaps expecting too much from this book, but it has such a cult status that I went in expecting it to be appealing on an adult level. There's no question that it's beautifully written, and the Darkangel, his castle and brides well-described; the problem is the heroine. Aerial is a perfect fairy-tale heroine--in fact, like Cinderella or Snow White, she is just flat-out perfect. No wryness, no irony, no flaws, and no sense of humor; no explanation how she got to be so darn brave and loveable; where other women fail, she succeeds just 'cause she's so completely *good*. There's no backstory and no depth to her. Little kids might find her appealing, but compared to the heroines of Martha Wells or even Tamora Pierce, she is flat & uninteresting; definitely unengaging for the adult reader. (Maybe she gains another dimension or two in the next books; I didn't care enough to keep going.)"
5,A MUST READ!!!!!,ABSOLUTELY CAPTIVATING!!!!! I looked at the cover and that was it. I knew this book had to be good but it turned out to be better. It was the best book I have EVER read in my whole entire life!!!!! The plot was bewitching. It was like a mystery almost with the smallest clues to pick up. Some conversations were kind of confusing and it was a little slowpaced at first but the main problem with it was that THERE'S NO SEQUEL!!!!!
3,Okay...,"This book was odd. It wasn't historical fiction, though some things had a parallel to our history. It was definitely a fantasy book, with lots of different magical elements.Some things I had a hard time picturing. It mostly came up in the sequel, but some people had different color skins. I'm not talking white/black/tan either. That was just random for me.I started this series for the romance. But so far it just seems so much more about the action. That's not me. Action and me is bad, with a few exceptions.I wouldn't stay with this series because it's not giving me the romance I want, but I'm hoping the romance appears in the third book and it'll be less of a disappointment."
4,Simple and Beautiful,"This book first struck me as just a little neat book with some made up words for every day objects, any other fantasy book. As it went on, however, the scale got much larger and got much more beautiful. Aeriel is a great heroine, someone that represents the element of love in all of us, willing to do anything for that ""what if?"". Her ultimate sacrifice for beauty and innocence was the best part. I couldnt put this book down, i read it in one day actually.Also, I've never read a vampire novel that actually had the vampire with wings, i loved it, for its something i've always wanted to see in a book personally. Now i can't wait to read the second one!"
2,Sounded to good to be true,"I tried this device on 3 computers. xp, 2000, and 98 SE. Track ball would only give horizontal motion. IOGear support had me try deselecting scroll wheel on the mouse driver. No good. Maybe I received the 1 in 1000 bad ones....but a lot of wasted time. As with everything else with this outfit, AMAZONs return process top notch painless and quick."
3,Wireless mouse / Laser pointer,"This product works OK. It is a convenient package of laser pointer and mouse in one. But my biggest problem is its trackball does not always work well. At times, the trackball either moves the cursor too much or not at all. It has to be taken out of its socket and cleaned ~4hrs, just to keep it functioning in a decent manner. Maybe a rubber trackball, instead of a hard plastic one, works better."
4,Funny but not really riddles,This is really more of a joke book. Overall it is pretty funny but I was disappointed because I was expecting riddles (along the lines of the type that Bilbo & Gollum throw back and forth in The Hobbit).
1,not riddles but jokes,"I bought this book expecting riddles, but its a joke book, which was not what I was looking for at all! I am very disappointed."
5,My girls love it!,My girls ages 6 and 9 can stay entertained with this book for hours! Very cute riddles for kids! You wont be dissapointed.
5,Great for Kids,"I teach High School and whenever I have just a few minutes left in class to fill or just before I start a lesson, I'll read a couple of riddles from this book aloud to my kids to lighten up the mood. The riddles are silly and that's why even my 15 to 17 year olds enjoy both trying to guess what the answers are and laughing at some of them. They really like them. It's not really for adults but it's fun either way."
3,Not What I Expected,"I bought this book for my nephews who are into solving puzzles and brain teasers. I looked forward to get this book, but when it arrived it wasn't exactly what I had in mind. The positive is that the book contains a lot of ""riddles"". A few of them even made me chuckle. However, they are better described as kids jokes than they are riddles. That's fine as long as you know what you are actually getting. If riddles is what you're looking for, I would recommend a book like Best Riddles in the World."
1,horrible quality,"Besides the book being a bunch of horrible jokes. Possibly the rejects of laffy taffy jokes (yes that bad) the binding was broke, the front cover looked like it had been bent in half for years, and there was scribbles and writing on dozens of the pages"
4,Riddle Book,"There are some jokes and riddles that are memorable and really funny, and some that I have never heard any form of, but you have to dig through a couple lame ones to find them."
4,Very Good folk/rock,"I read a little about Skyscraper National Park online, and decided to listen to a sample MP3, just to see what it was like. It turns out that this album led me to a whole new world of music- contemporary folk and indie rock. Overall, this album is very strong, Hayden is a very talented musician.""Street Car"" is one of the best songs I have heard in a long while. The CD doesn't let down from there, a slow guitar, steady drums, lines of piano, and Hayden's pleasant voice guide you the rest of the way. I strongly reccommend this album to people looking for a new genre of music or already established ""indie"" fans."
5,A superb Album,"Finally, all of the Hayden fans of the world are rewarded with a third album by the talented Canadian singer/songwriter. I have been a huge fan of Hayden ever since his first studio album, ""Everything I Long For"" came out. There is something about the way Hayden writes songs. The point of view of his lyrics always seems like the average human being, and he does not attempt to dazzle an audience with anything but pure emotion, in the form of an acoustic guitar and poetic lyrics.His comparison to all of the greatest singer/songwriters of the past (Neil Young, Bob Dylan, Paul Simon) is more than justified on this album and has already been proven on his previous releases ""everything I Long For"", ""The Closer I Get"", and ""Moving Careful"" (EP).If you are unfamiliar with Hayden's sound, this album is an excellent place to begin your journey. If, on the other hand you have experienced Hayden's genius, continue experiencing it with this album which is on par with his past releases."
4,"A fresh, new sound","I was introduced to Hayden this summer by a friend. It was so refreshing because I'm sick of the bland [material] thats comming out over here in the UK at the moment. Hayden gives something new, not because he;s completly original in his sound, just because he's different to whats comming out now. This album is very different to the gruge raw sound of his first album. I believe that he has grown as a songwriter. His voice may at first be an obstacle but I think it complements his sound. He's with no doubt a great musician. This album is definitely a must for anyone who enjoys honest lyrics about life. The country/rock sound is amazing throughout. My personal favourites are ""All in one move"", ""carried away"", ""dynamite walls"". The album has a few songs that are a little weak. There are times when his music makes you want to slit your wrists but there are times when his music really helps with the [stuff] life throws at you. Excellent album, a must for any true 'music' fan!"
2,"Bland, Boring","I bought this CD based upon a cross-link to this page and the rave reviews of Hayden's fans. I regret my decision, not because the music is bad, but because it is tedious and the guy's voice is limited.Once again, the fans of a no-name musician have stuffed the ballot box to make it appear that he is the Christ. If you're not already a fan, better to spend your time and money elsewhere."
4,A fine introduction to legal reasoning!,"Frier's work is an excellent inroduction to the Roman legal system and, in turn, to legal reasoning in today's world. Although this book is probably best utilized in a ""case method"" classroom setting (I was fortunate enough to take Bruce Frier's Roman Law class here at the University of Michigan), the discussion questions at the end of each case are excellent tools to help one reason each situation for himself. If you have any interest in why lawyers think in the method that they do, then this is an excellent way to introduce yourself to that line of thought."
3,A fan's love letter,"This is certainly not the definitive Bruce bio- nor does it pretend to be. All one has to do is read the introduction and get that all this book pretends to be is ""something to say"". In some ways, that's a lot like Bruce.As this is a fan letter, it's obviously pro- pro- Bruce. It tends to gloss over some of the more disappointing aspects of his life and career. But, then again, most people who actually read the book are in that camp. You can pretty much ignore the one star reviews for that reason. In addition, the author makes it pretty clear what his favorite albums are, and even if you are a hard-core Bruce fan, you may disagree.I think this is worth a read, then if you are really interested in Bruce one should read other accounts of him to get a broader perspective."
4,"Bruce, the phenomenon, from all sides","A good, quick read that covers all the ground Marsh's early promotional bio did, with additional insight into the psyche of the artist, his impact on pop culture, his political and spiritual evolution, and the nature of his fans from the perspective of a fan. Thoughtful and entertaining."
3,Stick to the politics,"While Alterman is one of the most creative, and insightful, political authors in the country...this book is basically a fan letter.It is light and easy to read, but Alterman does not know Springsteen and has never really even met him."
5,Absorbing tribute-bio,"Half biography, half love letter, Eric Alterman's dissection of the impact of Bruce Springsteen on america is well informed, expertly reported, and in a way that you don't see coming, completely gripping and emotional. The tale he tells of being kicked out of a car while sick for wanting to see a local Springsteen concert on Yom Kippur is priceless, and this book is full of moments like that which fuse respect and biography until they're inextricable. It makes the argument that an artist's life, no matter how interesting (and I find Springsteen's fascinating), is just there to serve the listener's passion for his work. I wouldn't recomment it for non-Springsteen fans like some reviewers here (why'd they even go past page 10?), but if you've found yourself drawn into the promise and messages of a certain artist, you'll find emotions to bury yourself in here."
4,The real Bruce is everything we hoped for...,"""If a body catch a body comin' through the rye"" Holden Caulfield would have loved Bruce Springsteen. He's no phony (to us or himself) and Alterman captures that so well.Bruce has the same frailties that we have, which endears him all the more. My parents died several years ago and the home we grew up in was sold. I found myself driving out of my way to go past the old home without really knowing why. Alterman gives an insight into Bruce having the same unconscious habit that has given me something to think about regarding my own past.I could not put this book down. There is a lot of human insight in this book that non-fans could even connect with. Alterman knows his subject. It's a great story and my next book is a letdown already."
2,Very weak.,"THe writer is a gifted one, but the book is weak. It should have been longer. This is HARDLY the definitive Bruce biography. This has yet to be written...Anyway, it's a fast reading that will give you a general portrait of his career.But, one observation about his defense of the total commercialism of the BORN IN THE USA album: I like the BORN IN THE USA album. But, if the video for DANCING IN THE DARK is not a total sell out, well, I don't know what a sell out is anymore.."
5,Boston Terrier magnet,"This is the cutest thing ever!Great graphics-really true to what the Boston Terrier looks like, and I have added it to my collection of all things Boston."
1,disappointed not up to usual standards,The two produced a work far below what they normally write. The narrative was barely readable and did not flow smoothly. Characters presented were shallow and disappointing.
5,Perfect,"First, I won the 3 place at an annual contest of plastic model with this babe!! It is very well injected. I didn't have to make any great ajustments. It was only needed my skills!!"
4,interesting.......especially coming from black metalers,"First of all let me say this.........i despise black metal, however i do like prog/power metal (not pure prog though) and this album is very remenicent to this genre, especially nightmare heaven. So for all you dream theater, symph x, and pagans mind folk out there who like the atmospheres of black metal and the musicianship of prog/power metal (guitarist is pretty good, hes no Romeo, Pretucci, or malmsteen though), this album is definately for you. i dont know what else to say so i will now speak in binary [...]"
4,A good although biased review of open adoption,"First, I'm not sure where the 'guide to adoption without tears' come from, but that being said this is still a good book for people who have doubts about open adoption, so they can find out the good advantages of it. That being said, I believe that the book is too biased sometimes and not very objective.Still a very good read for people wanting to know more about open adoption."
2,Seems too good to be true,"Bought this camera day after Thanksgiving, for a really good price,Though its definalty not thought thru on how to make a camera, the battery door is sooo hard to shut and to put in a Memory card it feels like you need to FORCE it inside, it runs on AA batteries and only lasted three flashes!!!!!! You take a photo and it says ""please hold camera steady and then it takes the photo after the fact.... I knew it seemed to good to be true to be a decent camera for 60 dollars.... its going back needless to say and Ill put in just a TAD bit more of my hard earned cash to get a decent camera to take photos..."
1,I'm sorry I didn't belive the other reviews,"Before purchasing this camera I did read several reviews, most of them quite critical of the camera, but because the price was what I wanted to spend on a 10 year old I ordered it anyway. I gave it to her for Christmas, but a week later no one can get the camera to work. She is out of state so I don't have the camera in hand to send back to the shipper yet, hope they will accept and refund my money. Next time I will believe the reviews !The one good comment I can give the company is that the shipping was on time, I was notified of ship date and the camera was well packaged."
1,Save your $$ - buy a different camera,My parents bought this camera for my 9 year old daughter. It kept freezing up - the battery door is almost impossible to open and close. So I exchanged it at Walmart for another one since this one seemed to be defective in how it kept freezing up.So the next one. Same problems.I'd like to exchange again but it is no longer carried at Walmart and too much time has elapsed. Save your money for a different camera - this one is a piece of &^%%&*.
2,I'll pass,"I bought this camera to avoid the hefty price of a name brand, since I only wanted something better than my first $20 digital camera.My intention was to be able to take better pictures of my items for sale and just better photos all around.This particular camera may take nice background photos once you master the effects of all the option buttons -- but it lacks in clarity and eats batteries like there's no tomorrow.Turns out my $20 camera takes better photos albeit small photos....The included editing software was of no help to correct picture quality problems .. so I feel cheated all the way around and now wonder which camera will be a better choice and not kill my pocket book."
2,MISSING ENCYCLOPEDIA INFORMATION !!,"Chapter 6 is entitled ""Dictionaries and Encyclopedias"" ... but doesn't talk about encyclopedias! The entire chapter discusses only dictionaries.Moreover, encyclopedias aren't given thorough in-depth treatment anywhere in the book. Was the encyclopedia section mistakenly omitted from the 2nd edition? This is a whopping fault for a textbook on reference information sources."
5,Great easy to follow recipes,No one is better than Rick Bayless in giving us delicious Mexican food and recipes that are easy to follow. Love this book!
4,Mexican Everyday,"Mexican Everyday is a beautiful cookbook. My husband and I had watched Rick Bayless' show on PBS, and fell in love with his simple but enthusiastic approach to Mexican food. The introduction to this book is inspiring. Rick's ""riffs"" make the recipes very approachable. Though most ingredients are easy to find, he makes good suggestions for reasonable substitutions. My only complaint is not enough pictures of the dishes."
3,Disappointed,"I was disappointed when I received this book from Amazon and searched through for something to cook that night. The recipes have too many ingredients (involving an extra trip or more to the grocery store) - and just not realistic for the working people of the world. Mind you, the food was good, but I don't have time in my life for a majority of the recipes in this book."
3,"Good, but not for everyday","I did read the reveiws for this book before I bought it and most were accurate. I haven't tried any of the recipes in this book yet, but I have read it from cover to cover. It is entertaining, but I am not sure how often I will actually use this cookbook. A lot of times Rick recommends buying ingredients from websites, and I just don't plan that far in advance. Granted living in Chicago, I have a lot of grocery options, but many the recipes will require an additional trip to a Mexican grocery store."
2,Disappointed,"I expected this to be a basic book on Mexican cooking; it is not. The author does provide a lot of background info. This may be a good book for a cook who's looking for new recipes, but not for a beginner."
2,Not what I expected.,"This may be an excellent book but it just wasn't what I was looking for. I was looking for a basic mexican food cookbook with ideas and variations for your standard tacos, burritos etc... This is not it. Many of the ingredients cannot be found at our local market. I am returning book."
4,good choices,"The book's good not the best I've ever seen, but it does have some pics and looks promising"
5,"Just Like The Homeland, same taste but less work!!!!",A must for your collection of Mexican cooking. You will re-live the mornings at home when the aroma chocked you to death but when you sat and ate it was all worth it!! If you truly love Authentic Mexican food will you understand what i am saying.
5,Best Cookbook I've Ever Found,"I never write reviews, but I need to tell the world about this cookbook!It is incredible!Every single recipe I have ever made from this book - now over 25, have all been out of this world. All recipes use whole foods - with no spices but salt most of the time. The flavor all comes from the peppers and garlic and onion he calls for. If you like Mexican, this is the best cookbook you can find I can almost guarentee!Unless maybe you buy one of Rick's other books (:"
4,repeat recipes-with more/better graphics,"I was disappointed with Ricks previous books because I felt that the recipes were poorly structured,and did not have enough of his dishes photographed.I'm sure most cooks would agreee ...presentation is everything! Anyway,I felt that this was a re-hash of the previous recipes he has offered, and I was diappointed that he did not offer many new and creative recipes. Overall,I'd say that if you don't have any of his previous books,and like mexican cooking...you should start with this one. Very well done,"
3,Every day food... probably not,"I really like Rick Bayless on TV. Though I cook everyday and enjoy cooking his recipes seem a little time consuming. So, when I saw he came out with a ""Mexican Everyday"" cookbook I thought he had a book of simply or simplified recipes. I haven't found it to be true. Quite a few recipes require a day ahead planning unless you want to be in the kitchen all day long. The couple recipes I've made are very good, but I think the title of the book is misleading. You can't just open this up and cook dinner. You need to open it up and plan ahead."
5,Great Book!!!,"I have purchased many cook books in my time and most of them have ended up collecting dust on my book shelf. Not this one. This is a book that I actually use. The recipes are simple, and straightforward. Some have said that this is ""white"" mexican food but I am mexican and I don't have a problem with that. These recipes are much easier and in some cases, healthier than the traditional versions.Overall, this is a great, well-written cookbook!!!"
5,Amazing,This book almost brought me to tears knowing that I am not the only one who has loved and lost. I think this book is a grain of sand on the beach of Jesse Carter's potential. I can't wait to see what comes next
4,Excellent Gammaray!,"If you like the more recent Gammaray CD's, then you'll surely love this one. A few songs sound like they are being sung by Rob Halford and even sound like something he would put out. Very catchy on first listen and remains one of my favourites after repeated listening. Not the fastest GM but has more melody than previous releases. Get this if you like bands like Rob Halford, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden and Sonata Arctica."
5,They've done it again!,"First off I'm not going to compare this with any other Gamma Ray album but I will say if you love ""LAND OF THE FREE"", ""SOIS"" and ""POWERPLANT"" then you're definately not going to be disappointed with ""NO WORLD ORDER."" And while I do have a personal favorite Gamma Ray album it bears no relevance to this review.I do feel the band is refining their sound. This is mostly due to the line-up remaining the same since SOIS. NO WORLD ORDER has the brightness of POWERPLANT and the depth and warmer sound of LAND. As for Kai's voice - he hasn't sounded this good since LAND! Not to mention some outstanding guitar solos.All the songs are great but here are some of my standout tracks:INDUCTION (of course), DETHRONE TYRANNY, THE HEART OF THE UNICORN, SOLID and EAGLE.Heavy, melodic, fast and majestic - all Gamma Ray attributes and they can be found in earnest on NO WORLD ORDER. If you don't agree all I can say is we weren't listening to the same album.So don't be cheap! But it now!"
2,Can Gamma Ray keep it going?,"Kai Hansen has been working too much (thanks God). Besides Gamma Ray, he plays in Iron Savior and in another dozen projects, like tribute albuns, etc. So, it's unavoidable that sometimes his genius must be given a halt, to regain its breathing!!! NO WORLD ORDER seems clearly a ""beked-up"" version of previous Gamma Ray albuns and, worst of all, copies things from other songs unashamedly. You could rest a while, Gamma Ray. Just tour and give a break from recording new albuns."
5,Eye opener,"Reading this book, when I was 15, opened my eyes to just how far the US is from being a country ""by the people and for the people"". Unless ""the people"" is defined as a small group dedicated to their own preservation at the expense of the rest of us. I remember a friend of mine giving a book report on this book and saying Garrison really had nothing new to add and supporting the Warren Commission's viewpoint. I thought, ""did you even read the book or just read what someone else said about it?""Garrison introduced lots of material that had not been covered anywhere else at the time and gave reasonable explanations for who really killed Kennedy and why.As another reviewer said, as valid today as when it was written. There are still people preventing ""the will of the people"" from ruling the US."
5,A Heritage of Stone,This is an important JFK assassination book. It provides the viewpoint of Jim Garrison and why he felt CIA rather than the mafia was the responsible group involved in the assassination.
2,Surprisingly Amateurish,"I love R.E.M. and I particularly love the R.E.M. songs that were recorded under the I.R.S. label. However, this video collection is surprisingly amateurish and it is missing many of the great videos that R.E.M. made during this period. I think it is time for R.E.M. and I.R.S. to mend fences, remaster the work off of the first five and a half R.E.M. albums, and issue a complete and professional compilation of the videos from this period."
3,On its own terms,"""Hey Zeus"" may not be X's greatest moment in the recording studio. But, taken on its own terms, it is an excellent album. If it was anyone else but X, it would have been widely praised. However, it is the legendary Los Angeles band's album. As a result, it lacks the urgency, overall songwriting craft and inventiveness that made previous albums landmark endeavors. Highlights include the melancholy ""Into the Light."""
5,Excellent as usual,"This is my second Kitka cd and once again I am delighted. Every song has it's own appeal and even though the languages are foreign to me, the sentiment is strong and the listening pure enjoyment. This group of women transport us over borders and time and expose us to harmonies and melodies that have burst from ancient churches and Eastern European family circles. Now if we could only get them a gig in Edmonton, Alberta..."
3,saw it for the first time 30 years ago,Still scares me and makes me think.Loved Oliver Reed.Worth buying.
3,Burnt is the right word.,"This movie was not bad its just that after reading all of the reviews I expected more! Bette Davis and Karen Black are the only reasons to watch this movie trust me. Oliver Reed is a great actor but he is wasted here as the husband wanting to leave the forbidden house. Only in the last 30 minutes does this movie deserve all of the accolades it has received. If you want to see Karen Black at her best buy or rent Trilogy of Terror and you will find a movie that delivers not only talent but the thrill you were looking for in Burnt Offerings. If Miss Davis had been allowed a bigger part (i.e, ""The Nanny) this movie could have delivered. Dont miss the scene where Bette Davis is waiting for the grim reaper actors and actresses of this generation could learn from her face grimacing and lying on a bed to see what a thespian can do."
5,I'm still scared of that chauffeur with that stoic smile!,"I watched this movie when I was in my teens in the late 70's and the chauffeur has haunted my memory ever since. Not even the tall guy in Phantasm (my second scariest guy) could come close to that chills that pale chauffeur gave me then. I remember the numbing effect when Bette Davis discovered all those flowers one morning. And the ending, I remember closing my eyes and I still believe to this day that I missed it. I never watched it again. A friend I met recently also watched the movie and he was just as scared as I was then."
5,Great Movie- BUT lots of unanswered questions,"Great Haunted House movie!! Karen Black is wonderful (as always) and so is Oliver Reed. As opposed to movies thesedays, this was just one good horror flick.....no gore, just a plain simple horror movie. It does leave alot to the imagination though so you go figure it out. It is great to watch the house ""come alive"" again. But still-- we needed a few questions answered- what was with the brother & sister- - -were they suppose to be ghosts? was the house actually the ""old woman"" upstairs who took over Karen Black? Oh well, you just buy it watch it and write your own review and tell me what you think."
4,An Good Supernautral Ghost Story.,"A Family of Four (Karen Black, Oliver Reed, Two-Time Oscar-Winner:Bette Davis and Lee Montgomery) rents a House for the Summer and they are Beforehand Overtaken by an Unseen Compulsion.Directed by Dan Curtis (Trilogy of Terror 1 & 2) made a Good Ghost Film but the Movie is Familiar and Predicable. Based on a Novel by William F. Nolan (Logan`s Run), he also Written the Screenplay with Dan Curtis and Robert Marasco. The Cast is Good, Bette Davis hams it a bit too much than the Cast. The Film is Slowpacing and Downbeat Atmosphere. The Movie does have some Genuine Moments. Karen Black does have give the Movie, Best Performance. Although for all it`s flaws, this is a Good Looking Supernatural Thriller. Grade:B+."
5,KAREN BLACK AT HER BEST: THIS MOVIE IS AN ERRIE MASTERPIECE,"IF YOU LIKE BARBARA STANWICK IN THE MOVIE:""THE NIGHTWALKER""~ YOU WILL LIKE THIS CLASSIC."
3,Confusing but good,"I really did enjoy this movie and especially loved the real 70's filmmaking style but I can't help being a little confused/disappointed by the ending. It just left me with so many questions: Was there ever really a Mrs. Alerdyce? What exactly did the two old people at the beginning have to do with the house? Did it make them young to bring new blood into the house? And if the Rolf family was brought to the house as sacrifices, why isn't Karen Black's picture on the table of victims at the end? And what happens to her exactly after her family is dead? Is she the new Mrs. Alerdyce and if so, what happened to the first Mrs. A? I did like this movie because I'm probably just missing something but all in all I think it was definitely worth the watch and the discussion after as to what the ending really meant. If anyone can explain the ending to me, please email me: perrottafamily@hotmail.com"
4,hearse driver freaks me out!!!!!!!!,THIS IS THE ONLY FILM EVER THAT EVER GAVE ME NIGHTMARES. I WATCHED IT AS A CHILD AND HAD NIGHMARES WITH THE HEARSE DRIVER FOR YEARS. I LOVE HORROR FILMS AND NEVER HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY ANY BUT THIS ONE GOT TO ME. I DONT THINK THE MOVIE IS THAT SCARY BUT THIS GUY IS CHILLING. I WAS SHOCKED TO READ THE REVIEWS AND SEE HOW MANY OTHERS WERE AFFECTED BY THIS. I WATCHED IT YEARS LATER AND IT STILL FREAKED ME OUT. DEFINTLY THE MOST CHILLING IMAGE IN MOVIES.
3,A B-Movie Classic,"This is a creepy film. The late great Oliver Reed (The 3 Musketeers, Gladiator) stars as the father who finds himself getting possessed by the house and almost even drowning his son in one scene. The end is probably the creepiest and most disturbing ending to a haunted house movie you'll ever see. Would be cool to see this movie on dvd sometime."
3,Visions of Childhood,I am surprised at the number of people who remember this movie. I first saw this film when I was 8 years old. The Hearse driver was the most frightening character I had ever seen. I would have nightmares about him for years. I tried to find out as much information about Anthony James as possible. When I was 18 I rented the video with a few of my friends and we watched it about 3 or 4 times. I am glad to say I do not dream of him anymore. His character in the film was truly menacing.
3,Burnt Offerings,"Burnt Offerings is more of a Mystery than a Horror movie at least until the very end,it is slow paced and boring at times,but well played out other times, the House itself is the mystery,it is not a typical horror movie nor even a Haunted house movie,but some sort of bizarre creepy movie that isn't too scary just weird."
4,Burnt Offerings,Burnt offerings takes me back to the day it actually came to the theaters and back then I love it and thought it was scary and viewing again after all these years I still love the movie and I still think its suspenseful. I just enjoy my classics.
4,The Forgotten Haunted House Film/Burnt Offerings,"This 1976 masterpiece is at the top of my list for haunted house films. It is seldom on television, and I cannot understand why. Burnt Offerings is not your ordinary horror film with ghosts and gore or expensive special effects, but a psychological thriller that keeps you asking questions long after the closing credits role. If you want to see an average haunted house flick rent Amityville Horror or Poltergiest but if you want to be terrified by the horrifying image of a hearse driven by the angel of death, played by the creepy Anthony James or a wave pool that would drown any Baywatch lifeguard or an old mansion that transforms itself to its original state with every drop of blood that is shed by its inhabitants, you must watch Burnt Offerings."
3,a Pre-AMITYVILLE horror show,"I first saw BURNT OFFERINGS when I was about 5, and it was the most horrifying thing I'd ever experienced... nightmares for weeks and the cause of a permanant phobia of hearses and pall bearers. To this day Bette Davis' final scene makes my skin crawl...I saw it again 20 years later and while it's no longer as horrifying as I recalled, it's still an eerie atmospheric chiller which, for its PG rating, is still excessively gory (during the still terrifying climax)and has moments of intense suspense.The main difference I've found change over the years is how long-winded the film is. Nothing really happens during large portions of the film, but when the (subtle) ghostly attacks occur, it's definitely worth the wait.A must for fans of THE HAUNTING (the original, that is...) and THE AMITYVILLE HORROR."
4,"Roz and ""Brother"" sure have a special rental...just for you!","If you are a Karen Black fan (and really, who isn't?), this is the ""piece de la resistance"" of her horror career. After bullying her husband (Oliver Reed) into renting a gorgeous but dilapidated Edwardian mansion on Long Island for the summer, the Rolf family soon discovers they got more than they paid for.What's the story with the old lady in the attic? Why is Marion (Black) acting even stranger than usual? Why do you suspect Roz (the wonderful Eileen Heckard), and Brother (Bergis Meredith) seem so eager to rent the place?Watch for the chauffeur driver (or as I used to refer to him as a kid, the ""guy with the glasses"") and wait for him to smile and feel the chill work right up your spine. This one really works, so if you like to be scared, if you like Karen Black, and if you like 70's trash-o-rama, it's a must see.This was the first horror movie I ever saw (at the age of 5) and I have been a horror fanatic ever since."
4,Pure Horror,"Lord have mercy. I remember when i first saw this movie, i was young and didn't know what it was. I was TOTALLY FREAKED OUT by the chauffer.""dude with the glasses and that horrible smile"" I am 26 and believe it or not still refuse to watch this movie. I used to see it on previews and one time got a glimpse of a preview for it and my heart went into my throat. that's how scared i am. It's a good movie though. But darn if i see it again."
2,take this offering with caution,"I remember seeing this as a teenager in the theatre with my friend on a Saturday afternoon.Although the characters were all good {especially Karen Black}one could not help wondering why anyone would stay in a house that repairs itself.I know its only a movie but as far as haunted houses go come on!!! The hearse driver would be enough for me to start packing.The movie does throw some creepyness at you and the movie score will stay with you,even the final scene.Dan Curtis,who went on later to direct War&Rememberance series handles the camera well with great up close facial shots but not enough to make it rememberable. If you want a great haunted house movie watch The Changeling with George C.Scott and Trish Van Devere instead you'll be glad ya took my advice"
3,Poor commentary as an extra,"Great movie, though derivitive. A pinch of ""The Shining"" and a dash of ""Psycho"" and a bit of ""The Haunting""..... Still, a wonderful film with wonderful acting. The DVD seems blurry and hazy....but the worst part is the rambling commentary of Curtis, Karen Black and the scriptwriter: they offer very little insight into the movie and seem like they remember very little of the actual making of it. They also do naught but subtly knock Oliver Reed. Listening to these three is a total waste of time. Watch the movie and.....watch Reed's magnificent performance."
3,It builds up to a rather...,"...""swift"" climax, but this thriller for its' time and low budget is rather impressive too. In other words; I liked it. Unpleasant and mysterious as it sets out to be. The acting is really good by the entire cast, on the other hand what should have been improved is the quality on picture and sound like they've done to other classics from about the same time. It's from the mid-70s, but looks like something from the early 60s. A shame. Especially the picture is really not good, it's misty and unclear -and ruins a part of the experience. For me anyway, I saw the movie for the first time today (but don't get me wrong now, I anything but regret it).The movie is a bit long, almost two hours; The climax lasted something like 10 seconds, but on the plus side ""the face of evil"" looked very evil indeed. I've added this to my thriller-collection, and I'm glad to finally have done so.A solid 4 out of 6 stars."
3,Creepy Eyes,I am into creepy movies and I heard about this movie Burnt Offerings. It seemed interesting so I got it. The one person who creeped me out the most was the Mom. When she was about to push Oliver Reed out the window and you saw her eyes that scared me stiff. Karen Black or should I say Karen Blacks eyes are truly creepy.
4,A Haunting We Will Go,An old favorite from the 70's about a house that is not just haunted but is actually alive. Karen Black moves her family in to the creepy old mansion and before long all sorts of bizarre events begin to occur. Burgess Meredith plays the kindly old caretaker of the property and adds a real sense of mystery to the story. The ending is one that has haunted me since childhood and still stands up today.
2,An Oldie,"This is an oldie but not a goodie. Maybe, when it was first made, it might have been seen as a scarey movie. But today, with all the horror films they have now, it falls short of anything but weird. I purchased it because of Bette Davis being in it. Her appearance is all too brief. The whole movie is bizarre, with Karen Black adding to the bizarreness. I don't recommend this movie unless you are a Karen Black fan."
3,Excellent movie; Horrible DVD transfer,"I first saw this movie in the early 80's and again several times over the years. This version definitely does not resemble what I saw back then. As other reviewers have noted, the picture is almost milky white making it very difficult to view most of the time. Also, the audio is so muffled that I had to turn my TV volume way up just to try to make out the dialogue. Some of the time, I completely missed what was being said. If it weren't for the disappointing transfer, I would not hesitate to give this movie 5 stars. Great performances were given by all, but I feel Bette Davis provided her fans with a memorable performance as only she can do."
3,a good haunted house movie,a good movie easy to follow all i remember most of it is the scary limo driver of the dads past with his smile now that is scary but all in all a good movie to see
4,"Word by Word Translations of Songs and Arias Part 1, German and French","As a teacher of voice for over 35 years, having resources like this one I find indispensable. While the book is not exhaustive, that is, it does not carry ALL of Schubert's lieder, or ALL of Schumann's lieder, or ALL of Fauré's songs, etc ... in the classical literature, still there are a great many songs and their translations ... of the literature most often chosen by voice teachers for young singers to learn. The book is useful in that it not only gives a word-for-word translation, but also, where needed, the best ""sense"" of the poetry in English as well. If you sing classical song literature in Italian, German and French, then this book and its companion, (Part 2) are essential resources to have. I'd also go so far as to say that every English-speaking classical singer should own these.PS. Teacher, don't loan them to your students ... you'll never get them back!"
3,Good for the price,"If you want a cheap collection, then this is it. Most of the group's CD's are out of print and this collects their more popular titles but beware there is no booklet."
4,Fine collection of essays,"The strongest aspect of this work are the battle essays. Most of the work covers either the early defense of Kentucky by Confederate forces in the winter/spring of '61/62 and the combined invasion of Bragg and Kirby-Smith during fall 1862. The final essay by the editor on the Confederate orphan brigade was moving mostly due to the enormous loses suffered by these Kentucky troops. James Ramage's essay on John Hunt Morgan's raid was disappointing, while Wiley Sword's work on Patrick Cleburne who was not a Kentuckian hardly seemed relevant to the other works. If would have been nice to have seen works on guerrilla warfare, the home-front, slavery in Kentucky, Appalachian Kentucky during the war, or a number of other small raids, but mostly this is a solid work."
3,War At Our Doorstep,"Kentucky even though it was south of the Mason Dixon Line it was a border state. They felt the pain where their families were torn apart. Kentucky wanted to remain neutral but Mill Springs on the Cumberland River was the first win on the Union's Western Campaign. Bragg and Buell marched their armies around Kentucky and met in Perryville where there were eight thousand casualties. Bragg leaves the state but John Hunt Morgan, whose mother was a Hunt from Alabama, continued to terrorize our state with his raids. By Ruth Thompson author of ""Natchez Above The River"""
3,Review,"Roddy Doyle tells the story of a young boy named Paddy Clarke who experiences the advantages and disadvantages of childhood. Throughout the book, the things that Paddy did not think too much of, such as his mother and father arguing, or paying attention in class, becomes more important to him, as the things that Paddy seemed to think were very important soon started to fade, one example being his concern of Kevin's opinion of everything. Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha, is overall an exceptional work of art created through the eyes of a 10 year old."
3,Childhood memories,"In Doyle's novel Paddy Clarke Hahaha, childhood memories are well captured in the voice of a ten year old boy. Throughout the book, change in Paddy's voice is well presented in comparison to his experinces with his parents and peers.It may feel like a child's story in the beginning may seems somewhat boring but as you read more, the novel really gets into Paddy's changes during his childhood.Doyle does a good job on writing the novel in a child's voice. Overall, it is a relaxing book to read."
4,Review On Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha,"Reading 'Paddy Clark Hahaha' purifies our eyes to see things in a wider view and gives us a joy to recapture our own childhood.As a typical 10 year old boy, he is very mischievous. He often gets himself in trouble with his friends. He sees the world through innocent eyes which are full of curiosity. He pays close attention to details that adults would normally overlook and observes carefully changes in his surroundings. As you read through the book , you'll not only realize the joy of recalling your own childhood but also be astonished by watching Paddy¡s mental growth and the movement of his maturity level."
4,From a childs eyes,"In this humorous, yet intriquing novel, roddy doyle revisits the emotions felt by children through a compassionate novel about the trials and tribulations of growning. In vivid description, we follow Paddy(the main chaacter) through playground fights, the effects of parental violence and tension, sibling rivalry, and boyhood curiousity. This novel is well written, interesting, and draws you back into the world of your 10 year old self. I would recommmend this book to all audiences"
4,My Kingdom for a Compound-Complex Sentence!,"The novel is moving. Doyle's use of voice is brilliant.But I thought I would lose all vestiges of sanity because of the unending simple and compound sentences that follow one upon the other like ants at a picnic.Yes, I understand that this use of sentence construcion results in the authentic voice of Paddy, but as wonderful as the book may be, I don't think I could survive another reading experience like this. Beautiful and tedious, beautiful and tedious...."
4,Get Past the Format and Enjoy the Story!,"This is a story about 10 year old Patrick Clarke, his family and friends. The entire book is totally stream of conscious from Paddy's point of view. The boys in his crew terrorize Barrytown and each other! He also picks on his younger brother Francis - calling him Sinbad. Paddy's parents fight a lot and we find out, in the end, that the title of the book comes from his father's deserting the family and the boys chanting ""Paddy Clarke, ha ha ha, he has no da, ha ha ha.""The book is truly entertaining - there is no question on that end. It is also extremely hard to read in any broken-up setting (commuting, a little each night, etc.) because there are no chapters, no breaks and no natural flow to the plot. This also helps the credibility level as 10 year olds really act and talk like this. The insight might be lacking, but it frees the mind to imagine background to the characters as well as a future for each of them."
4,Very entertaining,"I'm not very familiar with Irish literature, but I think this was a good book to start with. The book does a really good job of expressing the voice and experiences of a ten-year old. It can get a little confusing in parts, because Paddy tends to get sidetracked in his narratives, but I love the honesty and complexity of it. I read this in my English class, and I'm not sure I would have come upon this book if I hadn't had to read it for school. The writing style is a bit different from what I'm used to, but it made the book more interesting. Overall, I would recommend this book because it does a really good job of portraying childhood and gives some insight into what it was like to grow up in Ireland in the 1960's."
3,Voice,"I think this book is pretty decent. In this book the author can brings out the voice of a young kid. The sentence, speech in the book are all really easy, clear sentences. It's like a conversation between two young boys, innocent and funny. Through this book, I understand more on what is usually on a young kid's mind. They can only see the surface of an object. They see things really simple. They won't look deeper inside of an object. They live in a carefree simple life. Although people will always say that for people who think simple, they are basically living in a lie. However, I think that a simple life makes you a happier person because you don't see the ugly part of the world."
2,Not a compelling read. The naysayers are right.,"This is a well-written book about a young boy in Ireland, but I'm about 137 pages into it and I'm struggling to finish. Doyle's quality prose isn't enough to keep you interested in Paddy Clarke's story, which is told from the first-person perspective of the boy himself. There's just never enough insight into the boy to really care. If you want to read a bunch of vignettes from a boy's point of view, knock yourself out, but know what you're getting.This is the fourth Roddy Doyle book I've read and frankly it is his least engaging. ""The Van"" is one of the funniest books I've encountered and I'm going to steer you towards that. Also, if you've got the stomach for it, you might want to check out Irvine Welsh's ""Filth."" It's not for the squeamish, though."
4,Committed readers technical bliss.,"""paddy clarke ha ha ha"" achieved the Booker Prize (1993) for obvious reasons. Technically it is brilliant; the subject matter is conveyed in an appropriate form. The disjointed approach mirrors that of an actual child. This fact make the reading much more interesting, as the story is not in a straight line through time.However, while this may be faultless, the story is definitely for a hard core reader. So don't try to read this book without 'warming up' first with a simpler more easy publication. Something chronological. Nevertheless, if you are ready for the challenge and you are a keen reader this is definitely something you should read. Even if it is just to say that you have read it."
2,Ha Ha Ha (but no ones laughing),"After reading Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha in English class I came to appreciate the book. Upon reading the first thirty pages or so I thought that the book was easy readying and should not be read in an 11th grade English class. As I read more of the book I say the true meaning, which is that children can see the world so differently from how it really is. Children also make up situations to be what they instead of what is going on in reality. I think that this book will take back anyone to the days of youth and few worries."
5,"""Whoaaa...ha ha ha!!""","""This novel is a great addition to my library. I would label this book a ten three times over. I deeply enjoyed Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha, it reminded and made me reminisce and reflect on some childhood endeavors and mischiefness that I got myself into when I was 10 years old. I can relate and I think that many others that read this novel will relate to the personality of this 10-year old Irish kid. Roddy Doyle properly shown his talents in this book by capturing or relinquishing his old 10 year old personality to play it through Paddy Clarke. This book was just riveting."""
2,Disapointing!!,I found this book very disapointing after reading the barrytown trilogy.I have read and re read the trilogy seen the movies and totaly enjoyed them but could not seem to get into this one.I am a fan of Roddy doyle and hope that the next book is beter i am about to read a star called henry and hope that i find myself liking it.
2,Cliche but amusing,"I found that Paddy Clark Ha Ha Ha, was a typical story about the triumphs and tribulations of growing up. It was refreshing to read the stream of consciesness style of writing. However, in theme, plot, and message there was very little that distinguished this book from a million other books about childhood. Although well written and amusing at times, Paddy Clark Ha Ha Ha was unoriginal and did not provoke thought."
4,Touching...,"Roddy Doyle does an amazing job of staying in a child's perspective, while evolving the character, the child, into something more than a kid, and more of a person. The reader feels connected with Paddy, the main character, but at the same time feels sorry for him because the reader understands more of what Paddy is seeing. There are moments throughout the book that are poignant representations of childhood, that hold no nostalgia for Paddy, but the older reader can see traces of their childhood in them. All in all, a good, light read with strong emotions, though the first hundered pages or so are kind of uneventful. Stick with it - the middle, what Paddy goes through and how he changes, redeems it all."
5,Powerful and memorable,"I found this book a slow starter but I am surely glad I kept reading, since it is poignant and funny and thought-provoking. I have found myself often thinking of it and am sure it is an unforgettable event in my reading life."
3,Not Exactly What I Expected,"I was slightly disappointed when I received this score. While the contents of the book are exceptional - as is always the case with Dover - and the binding of the book is unusually strong - sewn, not glued - I found it disturbingly thin. Much to my dismay, I discovered that this book did not contain every piece I had expected. Perhaps I am unfamiliar with the exact contents of the ""Nutcracker Suite,"" but all the pieces on my Nutcracker CD were NOT in this score.99.9% of the time, Dover produces the best score available to the average consumer. This is the .1%. While it might be the best score on the market today, I found that it was not what I had wanted. Don't get me wrong - everything in the book is fantastic - I had just expected more."
2,Too small,"Can't remember if the size of this was given in the info. but don't buy it if you want to use it as sheet music, it's tiny! Nice cover, but useless if you want to use it at the piano and way over priced. I returned it."
3,A bit of summer nostalgia,"A bit of summer nostalgia sets the tone for this cd compilation. While not the best overall that I've ever heard, it does contain many of the classic ""one hit wondeful"" summer songs that made my summers memorable for the last decade or so. Some personal faves include: ""Saturday Night's Alright"", ""One Night In Bangkok"", ""In The Summertime"", ""Ain't No Sunshine"", ""Good Vibrations"", and ""Under The Boardwalk""Not a bad cd to have ready for those long summer Bar B Ques...."
5,The Best!,"If you are a fan of George Lopez, this is a must have.If you are interested in ""chicano"" humor this shouldbe at the top of your list.The price for this package is excellent."
2,The alphabet killer,"I gave it a 2 star rating because it didn't really get into the killings. I lived in Rochester, NY back then. It all happened around the time my daughter was born. I knew a uncle to one of the girls. Yes, to this date they have not found the killer. It had the whole city in such a state that people from all walks of life were afraid for thier children. This movie could have more about the killings but, it's a good movie to watch."
3,Impressive Up to the Final Third,"I was very impressed by the first two-thirds of this movie and especially Eliza Dushku's remarkable performance as a perceptive detective hampered by mental illness. In fact, the whole movie is sensitively directed and finely acted by a terrific ensemble cast. Unfortunately, the movie falters in the final third, where a fictitious solution is provided, the least likely suspect is chosen as the killer, and the boundaries of coincidence (and credulity) are stretched to breaking."
4,"Awesome, except it should have been set in 1970","I LOVED THIS MOVIE! I'm from Rochester, I remember the double initial murders, and I was the age of the victims when they happened. Eliza Dushku is great! The best part is the theories gone through in searching for the solution to this unsolved mystery, and they come up with some insightful one's. On an intellectual level the movie is very frightening because it deals with how fear affects ourselves and those around us. The reason I give this only 4 stars is because the movie should be set in 1970, but it's set present-time (and that isn't stated or obvious from the beginning) I think they must not have had the funds to make it a period piece. Scenes from Rochester were welcome, but I wish there had been more distinctive Rochester settings."
2,Eliza Dushku with some weird neurological disease,"This movie might have been crafted into, at least, a fairly conventional cops & serial killer movie, but fails. It's a waste of a pretty decent supporting cast, including Timothy Hutton, who doesn't appear to get the kind and quality of work he deserves. There are many problems, including a silly answer to the whodunnit that you can see coming up the street way, way early. And then, once revealed, the plot gets even worse. Most problematic, I'm afraid, is Eliza Dushku's performance. Actors talk about how hard it is to ""do crazy"" and this is as glaring an example I know of how NOT to portray a person with mental illness. She's got all kinds of weird tics and an arm that seems to always be threatening to go Dr. Strangelove on her. I'd diagnose any number of neurological illnesses before the schizophrenia which is supposed to be her affliction. Her hallucinations are straight out of The Ring. Avoid this stinker."
3,not the worst movie ever,"The movie wasn't real bad, but I think it left some parts out. Some things needed to be explained, but were not. I was pretty sleepy when I watched it, so I will go back and watch it again. Overall I thought it was fair."
2,dvd,"the actual story was poor, but it was filmed in my hometown of Rochester NY so I enjoyed seeing locations that I knew"
1,Poorly written fantasy based on reality,"The real Alphabet Killer story would be a great subject for a film, but this version immediately drives off reality road into fantasy land and eventually ends in BS-ville. It's the type of movie you wonder why they even bothered to base on a real event. Clearly the writer had somewhere else they wanted to go. Why didn't they just go there without the ""based on true events"" tag. Not worth the time it takes to watch it. Even though Eliza Dushku is trying really hard to act her way out of this bad movie, her efforts fail."
1,Put The Tiny Topless Scene At The Beginning and Be Done With It,"One of the worst jumbled movies I have ever seen in my life. This might have made sense if I had been stoned, but to me it had no real value at all and if the reason you rented the movie was to see Eliza Dushku topless, then you best be quick about it. This movie was supposed to be based on the true story of the double initial killings in Rochester, NY. Not my cup of tea for sure, but then you may just like it, who knows."
2,Eliza Dushka fan,"The story plot seemed a little lame. If I was not a huge fan of Eliza Dushka, I probably would not have wasted my time with this one. It was a bonus that she did give a little flash of her lovely breasts. I would only recommend this for someone else who just wants to watch her acting and see her tits."
3,Different than the move,"I wish that I had read a few before buying so many of them. It's much different than the original movie. Still, it has potential to be good. Friends liked it years ago"
2,Super Reader,"While Chiun inflicts some unpleasant training on Remo, he must stop a crazed Doctor's plot to take over the world via human enhancement. Some n*zi style s*x blackmail enters into this. Reno and this very loopy scientist enter into an argument with a bit of abuse and philosophy thrown in.Rather disjointed and not very good."
3,Where's Chiun?,This title did not have enough interaction between Remo and Chiun. Would you watch an Abbot and Costello movie with no Costello?
5,You Are There,This is a very good live cd where you actually feel you are in Roma when listening to it. Venditti plays to the crowd with simple yet heart-catching lyrics. This cd is a joy to listen to and will make you homesick for Italy.
1,What a dog,"About the only thing that can be said for this dog of a movie is that it's better than the comic strip. And that ain't sayin' much. For those who don't know already, it's been years since Jim Davis, the original creator of the character, has penned the strip. Twenty five years ago, this strip was often hilarious. Today, the strip shows all the signs of pathetic design by committee. About as unfunny as it gets. The movie is marginally -- only marginally -- better."
2,Missed the mark,I think that most movies for kids that are really good also can appeal to adults with their humor. I think this movie missed out on that on both targets. It just wasn't that funny. Bill Murray who I usually like just didn't get the job done but that might be just the material that he was working with. After Nemo and some other kid movies that I found hilarious I had high expectations for this one knowing Murray was doing Garfield. It fell short on every level.
3,Pretty good,Garfield got a 3D look and a new voice from Bill Murray.The story begins with pictures and trophies of garfield then him geting out of his bed and doing hilirus stuff to john.Garfield spends his time in the nehiborhood.
4,Good children's film,Garfield: The Movie is good although I did expect a bit more. The big problem for me is why does Hollywood always have to involve criminals in their films. What has a criminal have to do with Garfield - Nothing at all. Bill Murray is the perfect voice for Garfield and without him this really wouldn't be a good film. I think they get the basic characteristics of Garfield although not all of them. The character of Jon is nothing like the comics but where could you find an actor to play that loser. This is more based for the children but adults (like myself) will enjoy it but will maybe be a bit disappointed as I expected more of the great and sophisticated Garfield humour to appear. I still think this is a good film but hopefully the next film (if there will be another film) will focus more on Garfield like we adults see him.
2,Why Did My Little Brother Drag Me Into This Crap!,"I Hate this movie it really sucks dont get it on DVD or even freakin watch it, it just sucks. I know its a stupid gay little kids movie but still you dont need a freakin story for a garfield movie. I think just watching garfield lay around doing nothin would be more interesting than watching him ""be a hero!"" This movie is just crap. Jennifer Love Hewitt Is a sexy chick and thats the reason i gave it a pitiful 2 Stars. dont watch this crap it really sucks!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,This movie is the best!!!!,Garfield The Movie is a must for all people.It has a little touch that makes you love it.DON'T HESITATE!!GO NOW!!!
5,gotta love Garfield,I loved this movie! it was hilarious! I don't own it but I rented it a few weekends ago and I loved it! I'll probably have to go buy it now.
3,I Wanted to Like It!,"I've been a lifetime Garfield fan and I was excited to see Garfield: The Movie when it was originally released. The best casting was Bill Murray as Garfield, but Breckin Meyer and Jennifer Love Hewitt were wrong as Jon and Liz. David Schwimmer would have been my pick for Jon! Garfield himself looks fine computer animated. Why didn't the producers have the other animals animated, especially Odie? I would have liked the movie better if the characters actually looked like the comic strip's characters!Garfield is not a bad movie for kids, but it is forgettable."
2,"garfield, fat, orange, and crapy","This movie sucks! All he does is eat, sleep, crap, and repeat, but don't we all do that. Bill Murry's the voice of Garfield. OH MY GOD! He reminds me of my friends grandpa. FAT, UGLY, STUPID, DRUNK, EATS RATS, HAIRY, AND ORANGE, ""HE eats lots of carrots."" Garfield is CGI, but Oddie isn't. WHAT THE HECK! This movie is almost as bad as Home Alone 4. KILL ITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT! I'v Got A GO. My cats barfing because it just watched garfield.P.S. Don't waste your money on sleeping pills just buy this movie.P.S.S It's not quite as bad as I said, but it still sucks."
2,"I love Garfield, but this movie really sucks!","The clever, ironic humor of Garfield hooked me a long time ago, and now that I bought this movie for my kids, who also love him, we find a slightly different rerun of a TV chapter when Garfield is caught and Odie saves him.Sorry but the effort fell too short!"
2,"It was terrible, even for a talking animal movie!","This movie was terrible and probably one of the worst movies ever. I had one or two odd giggles but besides that it is just boring and all my friends agree with me. It was short and I love the comics but it is one of the worst things I have ever seen hands down. People may have liked it but I was expecting a little bit more. Even my eight year old cousin, who is a kid hated it. If anyone told me I had to see this movie again, I would not, but I guess it wasn't all that bad some of it was actually OK. But come on, I mean Bill Murray has never done this bad."
3,Changed my mind about Jon Arbuckle forever,"Breckin Meyer might not be most theater patron's idea for Jon Arbuckle, but he is fantastic in the role---and almost compensates for an honestly thin plotline. I have loved him ever since Clueless (where he played skater Travis Birkenstock) and consider his casting the best point in the movie. Since I don't care for Jennifer Love Hewitt, anybody could have played Liz the vet--- but Meyer rocked!.Murray is great as Garfield (not suprising since the late Lorenzo Music had aproximated Murray's voice in countless cartoons) but why were Odie, Nermal, Arlene...etc were also not given the CGI treatment? Without taking focus off of the very big guy, this would have provided more quirk.This movie is not brilliant, but individuals willing to give it a chance will find something to purr about."
3,"Oh, I am torn on this movie in so many ways...","Was this a good movie?No, not really. If I never saw it again that'd be fine with me.Was it a good family movie, meaning was my 4 year-old entertained by it and was it devoid of anything overly scary or offensive?Absolutely. My daughter would love to see it again and that would be fine with me.Was the animation of Garfield good?Yes, top notch and it looked like he was really interacting with his environment, including Odie and the other cats.Was it true to the comic strip?Only in spirit. Real fans will be irritated by the elimination and consolidation of characters.The DVD has little to offer in the way of extras. In fact, there are no extras to speak of - no deleted scenes (although, I think it would have been difficult to delete any scenes in this skimpy 82 minute movie), no behind the scenes extras showing us how they created Garfield, the animated 3D character or how the dogs and cats did so well without a real cat to act to."
5,Puuuuurr-fectly done.,"As a longtime Garfield fan, I extremely enjoyed this movie. Garfield was always incharacter, and while some classic bits were made into the movie, overall it was a new Garfield experience. Best of the, the trailers for the movie did not spoil the movie at all. Considering this is a CGI of a ""talking"" cat, it was extremely realistic. The only problem with the movie is that, outside of Garfield and Odie, everyone else had a tendency to act out of character, especially Nermal. Either they should have made him an obnoxiously cute kitten, or not bother adding him at all. The same goes for the underused Arlene.Still, it was highly enjoyable and worthy of five stars."
2,"Oh, Garfield!!!","I am a fan of Garfield and I have been looking forward to seeing this movie for a long time. Maybe that is the reason that I felt let down. I guess I expected too much. I am amazed that there are times during the movie when I actually felt it was boring. However, been a fan of Garfield, this is must-see DVD. So if you are a fan of Garfield, go ahead and get it."
4,Very Cute,"I went to see Garfield thinking it would suck. But, to my surprise, it didn't. I had a lot of fun watching Garfield as he tried to save Odie from evil Happy Chapman. A lot of kids my age would probably think it's stupid, but I think Garfield was great."
1,BAD BAD BAD!,If they had made the entire movie animated it would have been 100% better! Well...a storyline would have helped too but seeing an animated Garfield in a real environment just ruined it for me. It wasn't believable for one second. And when they would hold him it looked like they were holding nothing at all. He's supposed to be this obese cat and they don't even try to act like they're holding something heavy. The best part of the movie was seeing Odie dance. And I only enjoyed the first 15 seconds of that. The rest of the movie is trash.
1,when jennifer love hewitt is a star of a movie...,you know you are in trouble. i can't believe they took a small piece of my childhood happiness and made it into this piece of cat litter. i hope children who see this do not imagine this is the garfield that has been a staple of comic strips for 20 or so years. (...)
1,A great movie; except for the fact that it was awful,"This movie, in my opinion, was only commendable for its memorable comments by Garfield; because otherwise the plot was rather repugnant, the movie completely ignored the nature of the comic strip, and the voice of Bill Murray for Garfield wasn't quite as good as the voice of past Garfield speaker Lorenzo Music. An unnecessary swear word was blasted near the beginning of the movie, which would have been okay if the movie had not been intended for a relatively young audience. Additionally negative is that Garfield's sayings concerning an ""astronaut game"" venture into the corny side, and that a collar that electrifies a certain man gets a bit too harsh for humor. Conclusively, I would recommend this film to all fans of lame-o plots and movies that do not properly follow their origins."
5,garfield is here,GARFIELD IS HERE AND HE LOOKS GREAT HOW NEW THAT THERE WAS GOING TO BE A GARFIELD MOVIE I DID IT GARFEILD THE MOVIE LOOKS GREAT THE JOKES LOOK FUNNY GO WATCH THE MOVIE
2,Garfield--a dissapointment,"I didn't expect it to be any better than the old garfield cartoon series. I was dissapointed. Odie was a real dog--which actually it still worked out ok in the movie. Also, John (the owner) didn't look like the owner in the cartoon series. In the cartoon series, John had glasses etc. I don't know, I had the certain picture of what he was supposed to look like in my mind. Garfield looked like Garfield which I guess is the main thing. The plot was somewhat like Toy Story.I'll have to give credit though. It seemd that Garfield looked and acted like Garfield which I was happy about that.Over all, I give this movie 2 stars because of the lack of making it look like the orginial."
2,what is this kitty litter?,"This movie was total crap. I love garfield, I think I was disappointed when the cat didn't look a thing like the cartoon strip. Jon didn't look like Jon. Odie didn't look like Odie. and Jlove Hewitt's cleavage stole the show in what was supposed to be a kid's flick. Then again, I'm 29, what the hell do I know about kiddie flicks?"
2,Disappointed,"I let my four year old watch this movie and was really disappionted in the language. I know it was rated PG but I thought Garfield of all characters was going to be okay for him to watch. I knew it was bad when my four year old started to count how many times they said stupid. I am not a strict parent when it comes to movie watching but I also don't like my two litte one's going around saying stupid, butt, damn and ass. All of these words were present in this movie. I don't know why the character Garfield had to say stupid, idiot and other mean things. It's a character for kids young and old....we don't need all of our children learning this disrespectful behavior. Parents can still enjoy a kids movie without having horrible language."
3,Not bad.,"Being a former Garfield fan, I found this movie to bring back feelings of nostalgia, and it was even mildly entertaining. The acting is pretty good, but the ""animated Garfield dancing"" scenes got extremely annoying after a while.If you are into Garfield.. check this out."
3,"Kids will enjoy it, but it's too weak for adults","If you're 6 years old and get a kick out of animated cats dancing with dogs, you will enjoy this movie. As a baby boomer, I loved Jerry Lewis movies like ""The Big Mouth"" when I was a kid. Today, I find it too silly to watch, even for nostalgia's sake. Garfield is the same. It relies on the physical antics of the animated cat to carry the day. I think the directors and animation artists were far more excited about it than I was. One time in the movie: okay. Twice: you're pushing it. More than that is just plain tiresome. So this goes well beyond tiresome. Gone is the edginess of the character in the strip. Instead, we have a piece of fluff that never comes close to its potential. Even the Saturday morning Garfield and Friends cartoon was closer to the strip. This movie is to the strip what Super Friends were to JLA: a watered-down version guaranteed not to offend anyone. But your 6 year-old will absolutely adore it."
4,Fun Film for All Ages,"I have to give this movie some credit: I thought it was good. I don't think it was great or anything, but it was at least good. I thought the best scenes were when Garfield and Odie were together. They made me laugh the hardest.I'm a huge Garfield fan and I found this film to be enjoyable but somewhat bland. This would be a film that's kind of family-friendly and not raunchy and unfunny like the first Scooby-Doo movie. There are some good moments, some are mildly heartwarming, but the jokes are a little flat.This movie is a fun-for-all-ages type movie. I definitely recommend it."
4,Good Garfield Film,"I really don't see what people are complaining about when they say that it's a bad movie. I just watched it and despite the few flaws and inadequacies I thought the movie was really good. Bill does an excellent job playing as Garfield. Cute movie that is really underrated. I've been a fan of Garfield for many years, way back when Garfield and Friends was a new series, I was a fan before that when Garfield was just a few TV specials and a comic strip, and I can say that this is one fan that was satisfied with this film."
2,Too Much Catnip....,"First off, I'm a die-hard ""Garfield"" fan. Thus, I'm speaking of the comic strip series and the hit cartoon show (along with the Christmas special and others). Seeing how Garfield did so well in the 80's and early 90's, this movie feels a bit dated.Since CGI is creeping around everywhere in movies now, I'd say it somewhat resembles Garfield. A weird look, but it works. I would been much happier if either the whole film was animated or all the characters other than Garfield were CGI (especially Odie!). The CGI Garfield and real Odie (and real Jon, etc.) just didn't work for me. Work in an mediocre story, and well, you have another great cartoon pasttime get caught up in the Hollywood shuffle.Die-hard fans should avoid this film. New comers, I suggest getting one of Garfield books (like ""In Dog Years I'd Be Dead : Garfield at 25"") or cartoon collections on DVD. You'll see how the real Garfield is."
2,A Great Garfield in a Weak Movie,"The CGI imaging of Garfield, along with the Bill Murray voice, are both perfect. The rest of the movie is very disappointing, sort of a cross-gender/cross-species version of 101 Dalmations without the laughs. Why put so much effort into perfecting the Garfield character and then neuter him with a weak script? It's as though the scriptwriter never read a Garfield strip."
5,Absolutely Adorable !!!,"Garfield was the cutest movie I have seen in a while. I have to admit that I have a cat - and I was laughing hysterically at all of Garfield's cat antics. Very realistic indeed !The only weird thing was that all the other animals are real animals. Garfield is the only animated one. But once you get over that it won't matter.A cute story-line, with lots of dogs, mice and even more cats.I really loved it."
2,dont buy ones saying actecptable,this product sucked i was only able to watch it once after that the disc wouldnt play on any oher device i think we should stop buying the products in the condition of actceptable they are always in terible condition my opinion would be buy new ones people selling ones for a penny are jerkd trying to rip you off i know i have bought man products for the price of a penny thanks for reading!
3,Garfield,"Imagine a cat who can talk! Garfield is a cat who likes to eat a lot of lasange.he is also very fat!One day, Garfeild's owner, John, went to a vet and took a dog to their home.His name is Oddie.Garfeild do not like him. he always bullies Oddie when Johns not at home. Then one day garfeild kick Oddie out of the house and Oddie was lost.My opinion is that it is worth wathing this movie.This movie makes you wonder what's goingto happen next.The length of the movie is two hours"
3,"Predictable, terrible human acting, but Garfield is cute","Despite a brainless storyline and absolutely terrible human acting (which is typical of such half-animation films), Garfield saves the day because he's so fat, so nasty, and so cute! Murray's voice brings the cynical, lazy comic cat to life and he's hilarious at times. I laughed so hard when he kissed and stroked his teddy bear before going to bed. That gotta be one of the most hilarious moments in life. The orange fur coat is a bit too much at times, and ugly against solid-colored background (you can tell Garfield is ""pasted"" on the background), but you gotta love those fatty paws and that fatty tail. I enjoyed the movie, although I almost puked every time those human actors said something stupid, which was like every time they opened their mouths. It's a short movie, and Garfield rules, so it's still worthwhile."
1,Not very good!,"I went to see this movie in theaters, and I wish I would have seen Harry Potter instead. I thought this movie would be funny,well,IT WASN'T! I have to give this movie credit though, it DID have a good story. The acting wasn't very good. Overall, if you want to see this movie, you'll probably be dissappointed."
2,One of the worst movies I have ever seen,"Though not one of the top ten worst movies I have ever seen, it definitely one of the worst. The Jen Love Hewitt and Breckin Meyer look as though they're trying to obtain any sort of romantic chemistry but ultimately fail. Even the jokes fail in the long run. The kids in the theater didn't even find most of the movie appealing. The only life raft in this stinker of a movie is the dog playing Odie. He got the most laughs and captured the hearts of the kids with his big eyes and constant physical jokes (basically being pushed off chairs and jumping on its hind legs).Though I must say Bill Murray did capture the correct tone of wry humor and sarcasm for the role of Garfield."
1,TERRIBLE MOVIE!!!!,"This is my LEAST favorite movie EVER. I hate it. I hated it. I hate it! It's very dumb and retarded. I love the comic strips, but this is not even half as good as those. Never see this movie. It's just horrible.NeverSeeIt.I hated every second of this movie."
3,MIndless Entertainment,"Garfield wasn't as bad as all the critics said it was. If you want a fun movie to watch with the kids, or some mindless entertainment then Garfield is perfect. The plot is a little silly, the actors Breckin Myer and Jennifer Love Hewitt add nothing, but the CGI effect are excellent and Bill Murray is hilarious as the voice of Garfield. The real animals are adorable, especially Odie. Theres a scene where Garfield and Odie dance to Hey Mama, and I thought it was hysterical. Don't go in expecting a great movie. Garfield is silly mindless entertainment. Just have a good time."
3,Cute mixed with humor.,"Okay, I have to admit that I was ticked off when I couldn't go through the ads at the beginning, but I got myself to watch the movie. I love the idea of talking animals in movies. I thought it was a cute movie and funny at times. It's really not as bad as some of the reviewers are saying here. It's watchable. It's pretty short, though. Only a little shy of an hour and fifteen minutes."
1,Terrible.,"I rented this movie to watch with my 4 year-old son. Even he thought it was boring - and he was the one who picked it out becuase he liked the ""Garfield"" ride at Kennywood amusement park. I haven't seen a more pointless movie in years. The plot was mishmash of other plots, with the most obvious part taken directly from ""Toy Story 2"" (which did the rescue-a-friend bit infinitely better). Bill Murray sounds incredibly disinterested, even for him. Breckin Meyer is a sin against film and Jennifer Love Hewitt's career can be summed up in the fact that ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" was the high point.Bottom line - don't bother."
3,I liked this movie the first time I saw it....,"...when it was called ""Toy Story 2"". (NOTE: SPOILERS AHEAD) Let's see, there's the crosstown quest to resuce a freind from evil guy in a skyscraper. There's the dangerous get-across-street-while-hidden-under-something scene. There's the scene in the ventilation shafts. I'm sure there's more.Having said all that, my kids liked it, hence the three-star rating."
1,dvd is not playable,The product was falsely advertised by the seller. The seller has not responded to my request for a replacement dvd. I will never buy from this seller again.
3,It's really a kids movie,"Ok, ok, it's not a great movie, BUT my three year old LOVES it. He watches it over and over and laughs at the same spots again and again. I think that if you have a child that enjoys a good animal movie than this one will satisfy. (just never win any awards)"
3,Really 3 1/2 stars,"The fat, lazy orange cat Garfield gets the big-screen treatment, voiced by Bill Murray. He copes with the addition of the dopey but lovable mutt Odie to the household by arranging for him to get lost, then has an attack of conscience and goes to the rescue. This really isn't a very good movie, but I liked it more than I should have. I'm not sure why. I'm not even a fan of the comic strip. It probably has to do with Murray's vocal performance; nobody does sarcasm better than him, but he also brings some heart to the part. The character design of Garfield is exceptional; just watching him leap on top of something, then madly scramble to keep his heavy bulk from slipping off is good for a smile./"
3,Could have been so much better!,"Even though I've been a Garfield fan for as long as I can remember, I am going to have to say that I am in complete agreement with the previous reviewers in giving this movie 3 stars. The film is about average in relation to the amount of entertainment it provides and most of the jokes fall flat. The plot is not all that bad, but the actors seem forced in portraying their roles/characters (though Jennifer Love Hewitt is absolutely GORGEOUS). Nevertheless, the special effects are very good.In all honesty, I'll take the cartoons anytime compared to the movie, though if you're a Garfield fan you might want to give it try, but keep in mind it's no masterpiece."
4,Adorable Film,"Since I could read I had held a Garfield book in my hands, so naturally like all other fans I was so anxious to watch this film. It didn't disappoint me, matter of fact I assumed they would hash the movie quite bad, but they actually did a good job and made Garfield absolutely himself as he is on the comic strips. At the end when he danced out on Jon's porch singing I was laughing to the max and found him adorable.There were a few things in the movie they changed nonetheless, like Nermal looks totally different from his comic strip form and Odie as well. Yet you can tell the producers did their best to make Garfield's world as it was in the strips and I respect that. The movie was fun and is for all ages, not just children's, and the moral at the end just makes you want to go awww..."
5,watch it,garfield was really good dunt lisend to the reaviws that did not like it they dunt no good movie and garfield was really good movie it is really funny it is funnyer than scooby doo 2 they did a very good job on garfield and the voice of garfield is good if you like garfield the tv show and the cartoon movies you will love this movie like me it was so good go watch it you have to watch it if you are a garfield fan you have to watch it go watch it now and even if you are not you are going to become a garfeild fan.
3,The Fat Cat Is Fun,"This is a fun movie to take the family to. Bill Murray as Garfield really strikes the right chord and, for once, letting the movie go to the dogs is a good thing. The people in the movie are merely supporting characters. Garfield is funny and enjoyable and, if you like him in the comics, you'll like him here. Wish they could've found a dog that looked more like Odie though. It's worth a watch!"
3,Cute,"Ok, this is not the comic strip. Get that out of the way. The CGI Garfield is cute, but the real-life dog Odie is cuter (and sweeter). There are very few really funny moments in this movie, but at least we get to see the gang in real life. Bill Murray does a good job with the voice of Garfield (though he sounds bored most of the time). The plot is pretty thin too. At any rate, this deals with how Jon got Odie (after Garfield of course) and their first real adventure together. All in all, a cute film with only one use of profanity when the Happy Guy is bursting into his dressing room at the beginning. Otherwise, it's as family-friendly as it can get. The kids will probably love it, but adults may get tired of it quickly."
5,Murray at his best!,"Most comedians end up selling-out and doing cheap, shallow-humoured movies because their careers are slowing down and they need the cash. I would never do that, and Bill Murray hasn't either (not the only thing we have in common, we were also born in the same month!).Garfield brings some much needed sass to the big screen. And I'm glad he's animated, because that means he won't have any dander (I'm allergic to cats). Just kidding!! (get it? even if it was a real cat, it would be on the movie screen, so I wouldn't be allergic. it wouldn't matter if he was computer generated or real!)I only caught the first half of this movie because I was getting tired and I still had to watch ""Garfield - A Tail of 2 Kitties"" that night - my friends and I were doing a Garfield marathon.Anyways, Murray is a 10. Garfield is a 10. Move over Arbuckle, the fat cat is back Jack!Jack = Jon"
3,Fun movie!,"A fat orange striped cat named ""Garfield"" ( voiced by Bill Murray) has an owner named ""Jon"" ( Breckin Meyer)who loves him very much, until one day when Jon gets a new pet named ""Odie"" whom is a dog. Upset by Garfield, he lets Odie runaway and the dog is taken by a greedy spokesperson. It's up Garfield with friends to save Odie before it's too late.Entertaining comedy based on the popular comic strip and cartoon i grew up with. Jennifer Love Hewitt was perfect in playing Dr. Liz Wilson, Garfield did seem realistic on the fur almost like how realistic Gollum in LOTR was.The DVD is pratically barebones with no extras at all but a sneek peek at next year's animated movie ""Robots"" by Fox and an audio commentary by the filmmakers."
4,Stop looking for problems and enjoy the show,"Some of the reviews here claim it doesn't meet the 'spirit' of the comic strip, or is an 'awful' movie. Don't try and compare a live action & CGI story with a 3 sqaure comic strip and you'll enjoy. If you just sit back and let yourself be entertained, there's nothing wrong with it.I liked the degree of realism for Garfield. Obviously, he's CGI, but the way his fur is rendered is impressive enough that he becomes a character on the screen and not merely some flashy graphics."
3,Classic Garfield,"This movie is very enjoyable for tykes and those who love animal movies. However, the rest of the adults will find this movie lacking. The plot is unoriginal and found ot be predictable."
2,Garfield-,The script writer for this one is as demented as the man who kidnapped the Dog- He does NOT understand animals!
4,garfield,garfield was a great movie and what i say is that it has adult humour and i loved it all my friends were saying apartently it was really crap but they were all going by what my friend were saying but i watched it and it was funny .i gave it 4 stars cause it was really funny and a movie can always get better .by rachel
1,Stunningly bad,"I saw a sneak preview of this tonight, and was amazed at how bad it was. Bill Murray, what were you thinking? I don't think there's ever been as huge a quality gap between successive lead roles as between ""Lost in Translation"" and ""Garfield.""What can I say. The jokes fall flat, Nermal's voice is all wrong, and what happens between Jon and Liz is... well, let me put it this way. What would you think if Charlie Brown were to talk to the little red-haired girl, of if Schroeder gave Lucy a present on Beethoven's birthday? Such things are just not supposed to be!The only good thing about this movie was being able to look at Jennifer Love Hewitt walking around in some rather short, tight dresses.The kids in the audience seemed to be enjoying themselves enough, but they enjoyed the ""Gone Nutty"" short that preceded the feature a *lot* more. What a disaster. Adults, only go see this if you have to because of your kids."
1,Sooooo disappointing!,"I am an avid reader of Garfield comicstrips, and I was really looking forward to the release of this movie. That was my first mistake. In the whole movie, I only snickered once. Usually I'm laughing my a** off at the comics, so that in itself was disappointing.Also, there was virtually no paralell between the strip and the movie. In the strip, Jon originally had a roommate and Odie was the roommate's dog. The roommate was faded out but Odie stayed. In the movie, however, Odie was a present from Liz, the vet. In the strip, Liz never passes up a chance to insult Jon; in the movie she's sweet-as-pie (gag). In the strip, Jon's dorkiness is endearing; in the movie he's just naive. The list goes on and on.All in all, I am sorry I paid the $5 to rent this, but glad I didn't spend the $20 to purchase it."
1,When CGI goes too far,"I love Garfield the cat. I own all 40 books of the fat, orange tabby cat. I loved the cartoon series ""Garfield and Friends"". I love Bill Murray. Unfortunately I hate this movie. Well I hate the trailer which actually makes both ""Scooby Doo"" movies look like ""The Passion of The Christ"" and that is saying a lot. I don't know what is more offensive the fact that Garfield and Odie looks nothing like their newspaper counterparts or that the only big name actor in this movie is Bill Murray as Garfield. Bill Murray better have received a big check for this clunker of a film. Breckin Meyer as Jon Arbuckle? John is tall, lanky and dorky looking. Breckin is short and doesn't look nowhere near as nerdy looking as the Jim Davis' creation. And Jennifer Love Hewitt as Garfield's vet Liz is laughable. Call me a snob but whoever was responsible for casting this film should have tried again. This movie of my favorite cartoon cat looks absolutely horrible. (...)"
1,This is gonna suck,"Has Hollywood ran out of ideas? Garfield was an ok comic strip at best. You couldn't pay me enough to sit through this garbage. Do the people who make these movies think that we are all dumb? i know it's a kids movie, I hope its a kids movie, but there are so many much better movies out there for kids like shrek 2. This is not going to be entertainment. This is going to be a 90 minute or less lobotomy."
5,Excellent Tech Death!,"Okay, so I found Oppressor's ""greatest hits"" in a local record store, bought it and really like what I heard. This album I'm reviewing is their first album and has a lot of cool features (so to speak). The guitar tone is amazing (my opinion): it has that old school heaviness that a lot of death metal has lost today. The tone almost has a thrash tone but the riffing is definately death metal. The production is great, you can clearly hear everything without any one thing being overbearing. I would highly recommend this band and this ablum to any metal head looking for solid tech death from back in the day."
4,Lots of Fun!,Storybridges to German combines well loved children's stories told in English with phrases and songs in German. The songs are simple with catchy tunes that are easy to remember. This has continued to be one of children's favorite German tape set!
3,Sexy and silly,"First the story, the reason we read most books: If you're reading for a great story that makes reasonable sense, this is not the one for you. The plot is contrived and unbelievable (mistaken identity, crazy hot sex in public with the wrong person, a madame, a man ""buying"" a lady's company for the season, a murdered wife and no one knows who-done-it, blah blah). However, if the reason you're reading this is for some hot sex scenes, A Lady's Pleasure might be the book you're looking for. Lots of steamy and explicit sex. The theme was domination lite - Drake's bargain with Merriam is that she must do everything he says, but he never pushes his demands to an uncomfortable extreme. So enjoy it for what it is - a steamy sexual romp with a with a weak ""real"" story."
5,AWESOME!,"I LOVED THIS BOOK! A Lady's Pleasure is Renee Bernard's debut novel. I have to tell you that I am waiting on pins and needles for her next book, Madame's Deception, due at the end of this month.The sex scenes were awesome. Any book that starts out with sex in the very first chapter is a book that I'm not likely to put down until I've read it cover to cover, which was the case with A Lady's Pleasure. The story was good too. Drake Sotherland and Merriam Everett were both extremely well developed characters. Lots of description and interesting dialogue.Each scene was set very well with just the right amount of description without giving too much. The secondary characters added to the story without being unnecessary distractions. There was just enough about two of the secondary characters to make you hope for a 2nd book (and luckily there will be one).Sensuality Rating: Sizzling[..]"
2,Sort of ok. I wanted it to be over,"The initial meeting between the lovers was interesting, but throughout most of the rest of the book I wanted it to be over. Conflicts were based on Drake making inaccurate assumptions about his former friend Julian and Drake's current lover Merriam. Sexual language: strong/erotic."
2,A hot book with a good plot...but boring characters,"I really wanted to like this book. It's definitely readable, but the characters were somewhat flat. The best characterization was done on Julian, the villain. Also, I couldn't believe that Merriam would indulge in the kind of sex that she indulged in with Drake then continue to say, ""Oh my!"" every time she had an orgasm and remain so...child-like throughout the book.Perhaps I shouldn't have read this book right after Elizabeth Hoyt's ""The Raven Prince"" which will put many books in the shade this season."
4,good book,I really liked how this book started out. Very interesting and different. It was a good read. Worth buying.
3,Clear,"My fault, I thought this was going to come out a bit pink on my lips, however it seems to come out pretty much clear. It's alright, I still use it but I just thought it was going to be more shimmery."
1,TOO HEAVY AND STICKY,"I did not like this lip gloss at all. It was heavy, sticky, and uncomfortable to wear. On a windy day my hair would blow and stick to my lips -that's how bad this is. Nice scent, pretty color but the consistency was terrible."
5,Wonderful Movie,"I am a 64 year old woman and occasionally find a movie made for children enjoyable to watch. However, this movie, ""The Fox and the Child"" was even more than that. It held my attention the entire time. The patience or determination this child had in making friends with this fox was extraordinary. And the way she would wander off with the fox to follow him and be with him once they were friends. There are some scenes that would probably be a little scary for the very young children......but it was a wonderful movie and the scenery was beautiful. It was not your typical Disney movie, though I find a lot of them good as well. I love movies about animals. The movie is mostly narrated, but there are some scenes where the actors are talking.............but not the animals of course. :)I think most adults would enjoy watching this movie as much as their children."
5,Fox and the child,"perfect !! Thank.know your product ... still a great used conform to the descriptions of sale, very good and recommended.Greetings to all of America from Novara / Italy."
4,good,"my 6yr old granddauhgter really enjoyed this movie along with my 3 grandsons , taught them all about why wild animals shouldnt be caught for pets"
3,Preview the movie before watching it with young children,"The movie should be rated PG because of the final 10 minutes. The girl makes a bad judgment call, traps the fox in her room, and the scene ends with the fox's lifeless, bloodied body on the ground after it jumped through a closed window. After an hour of feel good movie, the ending was rather harsh, especially for young children. I certainly didn't expect to see something that gruesome in a G rated movie. While there is nothing wrong with reminding children (and adults) that keeping wildlife as pets is not a good idea, I wouldn't have picked this movie for family night if I had known how it ends."
4,a natural journal with fox in the forest,This movie shown the pure and natural heart of the little girl which can attract the fox to get closer to her.
5,Brilliant and tragically prophetic,"Most casual listeners have probably never even heard of Coil, and if they did, chances are that it was their IDM masterwork, 'Love's Secret Domain.' This is a tragedy, as Coil has produced some of the most cutting-edge work in the history of electronic music, and 'The Ape of Naples' is not only no exception to this rule, but it may be their crowning achievement.Unlike the gleefully satirical parody of the British techno scene that was 'Love's Secret Domain,' 'The Ape of Naples' is filled to the brim with sorrow and regret, as well as meditations on mortality (vocalist Jhonn Balance died almost immediately after the album was finished) and unrequited love. There is a treasure trove of beauty in these songs, balanced with painful honesty and a wonderful, ironically funereal-yet-reassuring cover of the theme song to the British sitcom ""Are You Being Served?"", prophetically entitled ""Going Up."" A must have for Coil fans, and indeed fans of music in general."
3,"Ok, I guess...","It doesn't feel like an album or statement, just a collection of odds and ends things that never saw the light of day. I don't know how one could say this is the best when Musick To Play In The Dark 1 & 2 are greater and more concise pieces of work. If you are a dieheard Coil fan and have everything this is nothing new. It really is just a bunch alternate mixes of already great music. If you have money to burn and want to get it just to get it that should be reason enough. I say start with Love's Secret Domain or the Moon's Milk/Seasonal collection."
4,Punch Drunk Pepperland,"Jon Brion is an excellent arranger, who has produced albums with Aimee Mann, Fiona Apple, the Eels and Rufus Wainright (among others). For the soundtrack to PUNCH DRUNK LOVE, Brion plunges into Davy Jones' Locker for an orchestral rediscovery of the Beatles' YELLOW SUBMARINE soundtrack album, side-two (composed and arranged by George Martin). The overture to Brion's PUNCH DRUNK LOVE soundtrack, in its waltz time, feels like it was plucked right from the brilliant second half of Martin's ""Sea of Time."" This soundtrack shifts back and forth between delectible orchestral pop, experimental instrumentals, incongruous vocal tracks and sweeping soundtrack melodies. These days, fans of George Martin's side of the YELLOW SUBMARINE album are few and far between. But for those of us out there, consider this a follow-up... cut from the same cloth... and not one to miss. File Under -- Pop Psychedelia."
1,super annoying soundtrack,"I'm a PTA fan, and this movie is great. The music itself is creative and interesting, yet totally distracting, annoying, and ultimately very diminishing of the filmic experience. It seems to function more as an art piece and not backdrop to a narrative. My understanding of how film music functions best is to be background, not foreground. This soundtrack failed."
5,THIS CD IS AWESOME,"This is one of the best CD's i have heard in a long time, I love every track, these guys have the talent to be around for a long time. People need to give this CD a chance because you will not be disappointed!!"
4,Slow songs go on the chain.,"I first heard of them on Jenny Jones. I was on the phone with my friend and told her to watch it, then I got on amazon and purchased it. 3pc cd is off the hook. I think that's how I made my son. If you looking for some baby making music then this is the cd to cop."
2,Nice Start,"The CD is not that bad for first time out. It has it good points and just the same old Hip-Hop R&B stuff. Still these guys have potental to get better with the right producers. They can sing. If they hook up with the right label and producers. They can blow up. I like the CD, Keep you head up guys and much success in the future"
5,"Wonderful, relaxing music","This cd will spend much time on my player. It is so lively, yet comforting music to listen to.Parkening provides wonderful tribute to Segovia with Spanish compositions especially loved by the master, even some of them performed on one his Segovia's guitars.For the classical guitar enthusiast, or just someone looking for that refreshing guitar music we here on the FM, this is a fine selection."
1,poor product,"As the first review, I also received the product with the corner of the refrigerator cracked off of it.The refrigerator also doesn`t has a panel to show the temperature, so it`s a very simple one. Would not recommend it."
2,Missing Parts,HiI ordered this item and yes its all very well that it showed up on time but the delivery company left it out in the rain. Then when it was checked to ensure all parts were present I found that the owner/operators manual or warranty information were both missing. This is unacceptable and could mean I will return for a full refund as I do not have the instructions to ensure its used correctly.
1,"Good customer service, poor product","The Koolatron Wine Cooler arrived with the window broken. I called the number listed and they promptly sent me a new one. They did not ask me to return the first one. I was taking it to the curb when a neighbor asked if she could just tape up the front and use it in her garage. About a month later it started making a terrible noise. We thought it was damaged when it was dropped. Then one month later, mine started doing the exact same thing. I have tried everything but it made such a racket I threw it out after less than 3 months of use. It was still cooling, but you could hear the motor/fan running from anywhere in the house."
1,simply awful,"A few years ago I bought one of Ibizarre Cds, number 4, and I'm pretty happy with it. The music is notfabulous, and it's a bit sappy, but it's well produced and there some tracks that are actually inspired.When I got #5 I was shocked to discover a whole Cd with grotesquely uninspired songs. Overly sappy,predictable and very annoying melodies with terrible arrangements that are trying really hard to soundepic and overly important. The result is a work of failure. A pity, especially after a good #4."
2,The title track is wonderful,"New Day: a great performance. Lovely background voices and balances. A great mix and a rich sound. Too bad the rest of the CD doesn't come close to measuring up.I agree somewhat with both ""Anacortes"" and ""No Interest."" Most of the other selections really should not have been recorded - they just don't fit the CD, esp. after such an inspiring New Day. And yes, I noticed the ""flaw"" right toward the end too - on the VI/7 chord moving to the II/7 chord - but I don't think it took away from the performance. It is no big deal, and might just add to the intensity of the resolution. Good ear, Anacortes.Again, too bad the rest of the album doesn't come close to the quality of New Day."
3,Some exceptional tracks make this CD a joy to own,"New Day is not only a beautiful piece of music, but the performance is darn near perfect. The only flaw is a slight intonation problem in the highest voice right toward the end of the piece.Nouveau Poor is a great, fun tune. Some of the others leave me a little cold - not the performances, but the selections. However, the album is not a serious collection, so for what it is, it's good.The group doesn't sing as technically flawlessly as other groups (Chanticleer, for example), but they sing with great energy and enthusiasm. And the pieces are tough. Overall, the Kings Singers continue to retain their rightful place at the top of the a capella entertainment field."
5,Great Album!,"I was very amazed when I first heard this album. Their sound is like no other. They are so unique that you can't compare them to other acapella groups.I can say that their sound is better than a mixed choir because even though the King's Singers is only composed of 6 members. Their sound volume can beat a 30 member choir due to the quality of their voice.My favorite is ""It Was Almost Like A Song"" because of the countertenor's very light voice. The baritone part was also awesome as he dominated the scene when he took the melody.Overall, great album. This has to be one of the King's Singers best albums released. All songs are great that you can't resist missing a moment on listening it."
3,"It's all about ""You Are The New Day""","I first heard this recording on a PBS promo, and immediately recognized ""You Are The New Day"" by British Rock Band, AIRWAVES. The song was written by John David, and performed accapela with Ray Martinez on an LP titled ""New Day"" in 1978. Since the Airwaves catalogue in unavailable on CD, I am grateful to have a stirring rendition by the King's Singers. Unfortunately, the rest of the recordings are not up to the quality of ""You Are The New Day."""
3,"No, only got ONE cd when I ordered this","I just got it now. So if you got a 2 cd set, you're pretty lucky. :("
4,there is a double cd set but they are for sell separatly too,"This a great album, there's no doubt about it, but i like a lot more the first record of the series ""Cowboy bebop"" but this is nice too. I just want to do a precision here, out there are at least two versions of it, a double cd set and other that is this cd and single with the ""missing"" songs.Really very enjoyable both."
5,Caveat emptor,The set of all ten volumes is recommended...Anton Reicha: Complete Wind Quintets [Box Set]
2,Oh hum.,"Nadja had a nice cable documentary about her life and I thought she was a character that life deserved as well as music. However, in this CD she was buried by the rest of the instruments. It is still an okay CD however."
1,Not enough feeling or emotion.,"I was very disappointed in this CD. These are such great works, and they were left lifeless and dead. I would suggest looking for a different recording."
5,Simply Marvelous,Sendy Brown's debut CD is OFF THE HOOK!!!!!!!!! Her voice is as smooth as honey. Anyone who appreciates jazz vocals will definitely enjoy this CD. I've seen her perform around DC and I'm trying to see her as often as I can now because I know there is going to be a time in which all of her performances will be SOLD OUT! Don't sleep on this rising DIVA. Buy the CD!!
5,Not just for Halloween!,"A fantastic collection of monster-themed songs in a variety of genres from swing to old-fashioned rock & roll. You'll find yourself singing along with every single song. My particular favorites are ""The Mice, The Demons, & The Piggies"", ""Darkside"", and ""The Monster Convoy"", which is done in the classic trucker song style. I listen to this CD year-round!"
1,what?????,"I love stories of King Arthur, Guinevere, and Lancelet. It's the most beautiful, romantic love triangle ever told. I am so disappointed in this book. This author just butchered all the historical characters I have come to love. What's left is a mean, grumpy King Arthur, a very dull queen, and a sappy knight. And the ending??? I am very open minded, and love a good twist on a story, but frankly, this book just left me with a bad taste in my mouth, no pun intended. If you're looking for a new perspective of this classic tale, read Bradley's The Mists of Avalon."
1,Broken--Don't buy,"Horrible, one page of content and all the links are broken. You get an error message when clicking any links, or a ""this item is not available for download""."
2,Movie for the eggheads,"I think von Trier is proud of this film stylistically. But when it comes to fun, I do not find this movie very funny. It seems to be a movie for the movie wise heads. But as a normal spectator I do not find it that very entertaining. Anyway there is here and there a joke which made me laugh in the movie. It seems like Trier likes to dig beyond the surface of modern man. In this film the scene is corporate Denmark. One must hope that one day Trier will grow up and leave all that art crap, overcome his fear of air travel, and go to Hollywood!"
2,one joke,"I guess you could say I'm a Lars von Trier fan, this being the fifth film of his I've seen (the best by far is Breaking the Waves), but this one was an utter disappointment. I was curious to see how he would pull off a comedy, but there is only one joke told seventeen different ways. I laughed the first time. The actors, who do their best, are wasted. The camera roams around looking for something to do. In short, a good one to skip."
3,It was okay,"This movie had its funny moments, although Jon Heder was always better as Napoleon Dynamite than any of these other roles he plays. The concept behind having a ""school"" that is supposed to teach confidence but really conveys sinister ways in order to reach that confidence was good. I do not recommend the unrated version though. The only reason it is unrated is because Billy Bob says G## D##### about a million times. After a while the curse words get to the point where they are weakening the film and not strengthening it. Then again its just B grade comedy, despite having Ben Stiller in the mix. Okay to rent but definitely little substance to make it part of your collection."
3,so disappointing! Jon Heder-you can do better!,"I had high hopes for SFS, and the early previews (""trailers"") I saw were so promising. Jon Heder? Billy Bob Thornton? What could go wrong? As it turned out...quite a bit. I read a review which mentioned that Jacinda Barrett is too bland to be a leading lady, and I wholeheartedly agree. I would NOT recommend this. There were a few laugh-out-loud moments, but they were very few and far between and didn't make up for what happened (or didn't happen) in the interim. All in all, it was a waste of time. One of the few redeeming qualities was the soundtrack, but that didn't make up for that two hours of my life spent watching this."
3,"""What Does It Take To Be King Of The Jungle? ~ Awakening The Alpha-Male Within","The '06 release of `School for Scoundrels' is a light, entertaining and well-constructed comedy that will delight the viewer more for its clever plot then outright laughs. Billy Bob Thorton and Jon Heder click on the screen as two rivals competing for the same woman (Amanda played by Jacinda Barrett). I haven't enjoyed a one-on-one alpha-male competition storyline as much as I did this one since the '99 film `Pushing Tin' which coincidentally also included Billy Bob as one of its co-stars.How can you go wrong with the likes of Billy Bob and Jon? When you're in the mood for something light, but not stupid or insulting this is it.My Rating: 3 Stars"
1,Let this Bomb Lie and Get the Original,"This is a god-awful remake of a brilliantly funny British comedy from 1960 of the same nameSchool for Scoundrelsstarring the hilariously subtle Alastair Simm as the professor. Simm as ""Potter"" guides his students through the art of ""one-upsmanship"" by subtly undermining them, making them ill at ease, and feeling inadequate while maintaining the demeanor and guise of being a perfect gentleman at all times. Billy Bob's mean, paint-balling, yelling jackass Bad Santa rehash just doesn't compare . . . Please, check out the original-- don't waste your time on this Dog!!!!!"
5,Laughed my Booty off!,"John Heder is definitely the next Jim Carey. Billy Bob Thornton was superb - as expected. The cast was perfect! This movie was completely hysterical. If you play tennis, competitive or other, you will LOVE the tennis scene. I do not agree with the PG-13 rating, however. I would have considered it to be closer to an R-rating."
1,Worst movie in years,"I haven't seen such a negative, sub-standard movie in years. The preview looked great but I don't think I laughed once while watching the real thing."
1,"School is for fools, dynamite bombs","this is one steaming heap of poo, Billy Boob Thornton has sunk as low as he possibly can, and Jon Heder, just make Napoleon Dynamite Strikes Again, Napoleon Dynamite works at Burger King, Napoleon Dynamite Joins the Army and so on - stop trying to show the world your acting and comedy range, it shows in this stinker. I would feel bad taking this to a flea market and conning someone out of two bucks for this waste of film. I will have to watch Dirty Rotten Scoundrels for a week to get the vision of School for Scoundrels out of my head. And calling it ""Unrated"" ? Why ? was it because this flick is so bad that the even the rating system didn't know what to call it?"
3,On a Slow Night,"It's worth watching but has some of the recipe movie elements. If you're bored and want a couple of laughs, watch it."
4,pretty good,Billy Bob Thornton and Jon Heder work well together in this off-beat comedy. There are lots of recognizable actors sprinkled throughout the movie and I was pleasantly surprised overall (especially after seeing the sub-par Mr. Woodcock).
3,"whoever wrote this movie, needs to take Dr. P's class !","The concept has been rehashed, Anger Management and a bit of Fight Club references, with a little Hitch added to it.But the story so silly and dumb, its a complete waste of Thornton's talent and its good that Ben Stiller's cameo appears to give this movie some needed lift.Very Average movie, a rental at best (only if there's no other option)"
3,CAMEOS GALORE SAVE THIS FILM !,"Liking the many talented people in this film will make you appreciate the humor in this OK comedy. I don't want to be too harsh as It did hold my interest the entire time, but with all these veterans it should have had me rolling on the floor."
5,Caution! This book will change your life!,"My sister read this book back in 1980. A few months after she read it, she died from a blood clot at the age of 19. At her funeral I heard stories from her co-workers, friends and family members about how Sandy had changed after she read this book and that she told everyone that she was going to go to heaven when she died and that she believed in Jesus. She had been into a lot of trouble and had a hard time finding her way in life until she read this book. A friend of mine came to see me after my sister died and she couldn't believe how calm and peaceful my family was after losing Sandy. She had recently moved out from he husband and was having a hard time with her life. I told her to read this book and she did and it changed her life. She went back to her husband and they are still married to this day. They started going to church together and even ended up teaching couple classes in the church together. GET THIS BOOK! IT WILL BE WORTH IT!"
2,Beyond Death's Door,"I chose to read this book because the subject matter is about near death experiences. It was my desire to compare my own experience to those in this book. For those of you who are not overtly religious, most of this book is peppered with quotes from the bible. The stories and examples from the patients themselves were very interesting and make this book only marginally worth the read."
2,"C'MON DOC WHERE TALKING CLINICAL DEATH, HERE.","As a former Paramedic I take a skeptic's view when reading about so called near death experiences or ""nde's"". The author, a cardiologist, should realize that nde's are just that. Just because your heart stops beating and you cease to breath you are not really dead, yet! That is called clinical death....real or bioligical death is several minutes away. Biological or brain death occurs as the neurons in the brain begin to die from hypoxia or lack of oxygen. This book is biased...fails to mention the diffrence between clinical and actual death."
2,THE WILL TO BELIEVE,"Observe that primarily those reviews which are rabidly triumphant in there assertion of this book's alleged ""truth"" were found ""helpful"" by those who've voted for such things. This says alot.People need to believe. Death without an afterlife is depressing, just like life without angels or miracles. That does not give these things objective reality.The bottom line? This is a book written by an evangelical Christian for other evangelical Christians, perhaps in particular, those wavering in their faith. Lapsed Catholic? You're covered, too. Scared secular deist? Close enough.Most of the book is padding. It is questionably written. It is poorly put together. It is far from diplomatic in its accessment of the data.On a closing note, scoffers, mockers, and collectors of ""bulldada"" will want to own this; it is every bit as collectable as the ""Christian Satanism"" books of Rebecca Brown, Mike Warnke, and Michelle Smith. It is also about as reputable. (GCZ)"
1,Doing it for the $$,"I would like to make the point that this book is based on fear, and that also there is no proof of these people actually being in a place called Hell. Were you there when these so called experiences happened? Anyone can lie-- but for the sake of not arguing let's say that it is true.. these people's souls were going to HELL.. is that something that should be focused on as a means to going towards the ""Light?"" Should that be the reason you believe in God and Heaven? Come on now, let's be real here.. One should have faith and a positive outlook instead of living in fear that you are going to hell. How has this book changed your Life? Honestly-- so you can go and preach to other atheists and other religions that they are wrong? This isn't science it's just another way for you to put money into this man's pocket. I think it's sad that people need to buy books like this to reinterate what they think is the truth."
1,a joke,"If I told you I spoke to God yesterday, that God was a chair in the sitting room of a Chicago dentist, and that God detailed all the truths about life, death and life after death would you believe me?No. You'd call me a quack, call my story hearsay and say that I'm a blasphemer.But some guy saying he's rescued people from death who were ""in hell"" and he's believable? To me it shows that people will believe what they want to believe no matter how fantastical.But this book as a joke for your atheist or agnostic friends but don't take it seriously."
1,ahh..no,"I saw this book from a fundamentalist website, and I can say that automatically shot down its credibility. Even though there have been cases of people seeing a glimpse of life after death, and they all report the same thing, which is no coincidence."
1,garbage...even for 9 beans,I didn't expect much from a set of 2 knives for 10 bucks. What I received was less than garbage. Save yourself some frustration and get a better quality boot knife from someone else.
4,Best opening of any novel I know,"Wiese runs into a problem here: the first twenty or thirty pages are so incredibly intense, rich, and captivating that it's hard to live it up. For the most part, he succeeds, but lets it get a little out of his hands. Overall, this is well worth picking up: I read slowly and yet didn't put it down until I was done. He manages to fit a lot of different themes and topics into a small, yet great read. And the opening is just pure excellence at work. Five years and two degrees in English Lit hasn't found much that rivals this opening"
3,The title tells it all.,"I received the cookbook ""Eating Well Through Cancer"" several weeks ago and have the opportunity to try more then four recipes since then. I found the recipe easy to follow, and the information given for each one is particularly good for me as I am also a diabetic. Would recommend this cookbook to anyone who want to be sure they are are eating properly even though they have cancer."
2,Read the notes,"Be sure to read the ""Doc's Notes"" as several of these recipes contain inappropriate ingredients for the condition under which they're listed. Some of the ideas are quite helpful; the subtitle for this book might be ""too sick to cook"" for the quick and easy shortcuts."
5,Great book!,This book has great tips and recipes for anyone facing cancer. Offers a lot to people facing or going through hard times.
4,Very Helpful,"I found this book to be very helpful in providing guidance on which foods to select while experiencing cancer. The recipes were also useful by providing nutritional information and suggested treatment stages for serving. The book was recommended by the nutritionist at my local oncology center, and has proven very valuable for my wife and me."
2,Skip it,"This book had lots a good recipes, but when I was on chemotherapy I did not have the strength or desire to cook these elaborate meals. I am single and live alone and these recipes where large portions. Also, there were several copies at the cancer treatment center I went to that you could borrow....."
1,Avoid this book,"This book has gorgeous photos of vegetables on the front, but the recipes contain an astonishing amount of processed food. And most of the recipes also contain dairy: food designed by nature for rapid growth. Dairy (especially low-fat dairy) contains hormones proven to be linked to prostate and some other cancers. I'm astonished that the hospital gave my newly diagnosed friend this book (stamped ""Compliments of Merck""). Page 183: (snacks and light meals) a cup of buttermilk, a cup plus a tablespoon of sugar, 1/2 cup of margarine, flour... etc, along with and ""Doc's Notes"" for the cinnamon bread that says, ""Good snacking food to increase your daily calorie consumption."" Even if you're in the dairy-is-good-for-you camp, what's good about snacking on sugar and margarine, and processed flour? Page 56: Quick Cheese Grits has 3 cups of reduced fat cheddar! The author has sold many books, and each one a disservice to the patients who use it."
5,May be the most useful cookbook you'll ever have,This book was even better than I had imagined. It can be useful for or anyone at any time. Get one for yourself and give one away!
4,Healthy Nutrition for Cancer patients,"As a newly diagnosed cancer patient on chemo and radiation, this resource is an excellent aid for what one needs to do to be nutritionally sound during this journey!"
4,great but not durable,"My daughter loved this book to death - it's death literally. I'm buying a 2nd copy, but why arn't more of Todd Parr's books in board book format? That would be OKAY by me!"
5,The OKay book is fantastic!,"We originally bought this book for our fifteen month old little girl because we thought it was cute that the book matched her initials (O.K.). We were very happy to find out that she loves the book's bold, fun pictures. Her mother and I love this too as well as its great message of tolerance and acceptance (without over-doing it). We immediately bought the rest of Todd Parr's titles."
5,okay with the kids,"My kids love to read and laugh with this book. The pictures are fun and the colors are so bright. I am about to buy the 3rd copy, a board book would work better for my 2 year old. My 3 and 1/2 year old loves to prend to read to her brother. Fun for all. We also like Things that make you feel good and things that make you feel bad, it is great for play acting out the book."
5,Todd Parr's books are wonderful,My kids both love Todd Parr's books--they love the kooky illustrations and they can recite the text by heart.
2,I gave up at page 112,"This book has a very confused time line. I read the book up to page 112 and the author only talks about Mussolini and Hitler's relationship, the Italian and German Generals and the politics. There is only implied mention of what is going on with the Allies and I don't remember Patton or Montgomery being mentioned in the first 112 pages.The book would probably appeal to someone who wanted to know the details of the politics going on inside Italy and between Italy and Germany. I was looking for a more comprehensive description of events with a single continuous timeline."
1,Nothing is our fault.,"This book is not worth the read. It is lots of pages, saying that the Italians, which I am one, were duped into making bad decisions. A long denial!"
1,Nonesense & Gossip dressed up as history,Do not buy this book. It is filled with anti-Irish drivel and false history that has been debunked hundreds of times in the past. The author knows nothing of history so he makes it up as he goes along glorifying the murderous behavior of the Normans and Anglo Saxons who tried for 1000 years to destroy Irish culture. I cannot emphasize enough that this book it totally and completely historically inaccurate. Do not waste your dimes.
4,Chet Atkin's Discover Japan,This a great release for the Chet fan who must have everything. The recording quality is excellent as with most Japanese Sony CDs.Classic Chet Gretsch guitar tone and nice acoustic resonator guitar. The songs are also somewhat different. Some beutiful melodies. English translation of the entire package would have been a real plus.
3,Poor quality recording,"The quality of the recording is poor. The sound balance is very uneven. Sometimes you can hear the soloists, sometimes not. Sometimes the sound of one particular choral part (for example, the tenors) is 'way louder than the rest of the voices when the whole ensemble is singing)."
1,Not very good,I received this back in October and I can almost never use it now. I keep getting errors on it and they don't go away even after taking the batteries out. Not worth the money.
1,Not good,"Just bought this camera at a discount retailer for under $20 and am taking it back. Bought it for our young child to play with and it just frustrates her, and us. It has a long lag time and it is even hard to shut off. Not worth the money!"
2,Mind-numbingly slow and out of date,"I bought this book based on the other 5-star reviews, but now I realize that these were written in 2002 and are out of date. The authors are college professors, and the book is written towards a reader that is some weird combination of a college student that doesn't know anything about computer languages and a professional that does. It takes a *long* time to get to the meat of describing anything useful, and never really makes me feel like it's explaining anything in recognition of my being a skilled professional. It's like a CNN news anchor explaining what an array is. *Yawn*. I've put this book down after 7 chapters of mind-numbing drivel. And please spare me the history lessons about Algol. I care, why???"
2,v600,"this phone look good but don,t work when press number don,t work speakerphone dont workmake alot fuss drop call a lot this is a bad phone motorola have good phone don,t know what happen to this one if i could give back it would be gone"
1,Worst Customer Service,"I received this phone 10 days ago and I'm still trying to activate it...The phone looks cool, but what's not cool is the service at Cingular. Cingular claims that porting a phone number from another company usually takes that long!! The long waiting time, even when you want to talk to a manager, is more than 15 minutes..I have decided to go back to T-Mobile... They're more experienced and friendly....I don't want this phone because of Cingluar..."
2,Not so great,I purchased this phone in June and in Sep. The volume no longer worked. I received a replacement phone and now the screen freezes and you cant see the time or caller id and it shuts off by itself... I would not reccomend buying this phone
2,Please Help Me!,Hey people i have a question for anyone that knows of any information on the Motorola v600 camer phone from cingular. Could anyone email me telling me why the v600 was discontinued and when it will be avaiable for purchase at cingular stores.Please email me back i really want to know. Email adress: mdsteele189@kc.rr.com
2,For anyone planning on buying the V600 using Cingular,"Take the advice no one offered me. Don't.This phone was recalled by Cingular (although they insist that it was recalled by Motorola, which Motorola denies) three weeks before I bought it. They sold me a recalled phone and required me to sign up for 2 years of service.Two months later, I was told it was recalled and they offered to send me another (refurbished) phone. I told them I wanted to be credited for the phone cost which they refused. So they sent me another cell phone (V600). The new one is missing part of its front cover casing.I called Cingular and they said the only choice was to to send another phone, cancel the service ($200) or buy a new phone for whatever I pay out of pocket.This is unacceptable. If you buy this phone, don't go with Cingular.The only reason that the phone is a 2 and not a 1 is that you can actually make telephone calls on it. It does work for that purpose."
2,"Beware- Looks good, but that is about it.....","Have had this model for over a year and I have had to exchange it 3times. Due to my screen disappearing. I called t-mobile and asked if there is a recall on this model, but they say there is not. Also I have noticed that the rescpection decreases after 3months."
5,"Simple, Elegant and Powerful","This is my second motorola phone in last 4 years. i used to have a V60 and then i upgraded to this V600 model. i really liked by v60 and i like V600 even more. the phone is very simple to use. it does have a camera but i rarely use it. the picture quality is alright, but thats doesnt matter to me that much. what really matters to me is the functionality and the call quality. after all thats what the cell phones are for, arent they? the call quality is nice, if you use speaker phone you will like the clarity. the best feature i like about the phone is that you can change the ring style by the press of button on the side without even opening the phone. press the down button once and then press the button underneath the down button to switch from loud to silent to vibrate to vibrate & ring."
3,Cool to be back to Mexico ...with Celia Cruz,"I have been looking for ""La Vida Es Un Carnaval"" for 6 years. First, forgot the author; second, forgot the title....My mexican friends helped me to recognize that song and than I decided to buy several items of hers....Than I found HITS MIX by Celia Cruz on AMAZON. Maybe I expected a little bit more but ...That it is still my MEXICAN favourite music"
5,The greatest!,This is a good one for first timers! Life is a Carnival is my favorite!She will be with us forever thorough her music!
3,Mezclas... no por favor,"Celia Cruz es una señora de la salsa, sus canciones valen por si mismas y no es necesario tener que recurrir a mezclas extrañas para convertirlas en éxito.Si este disco fue un intento para conquistar al publico mas joven, fue un intento en vano, pues son mezclas de canciones exitosas como La Negra Tiene Tumbao, Sazon, Que le den Candela y La Vida es un Carnaval.La version en español de I Will Survive esta muy bien interpretada en la voz de la guarachera de Cuba, que es reina de la salsa, sin necesidad de ""mixes"" ni ""remixes"""
5,Celia You will Be Missee,"Celia CD HITS MIX is the best one. She was trulry a role model for everyone. Now Tell me who has made about 70 recordings, Name anymore Becasue there is anyone that you can compare to Celia Cruz she was the best, and NO and I mean NO ONE was,is, or going to be the best like Celia Cruz. She didn't do it for the Money, she did it becasue she LOvEd to Sing, todays artist just do if for the Money."
1,A Touch of Mink Revisited?,"Perhaps the author has never seen the Carey Grant/Doris Day movie ""A Touch of Mink"" (circa early 1960's), however, The Millionaire's Proposition mimics that story line almost entirely. I realizes certain scenarios are often borrowed in romance novels, but, usually not the entire story! Millionaire does not want wife, does want fling. Nice small-town girl wants marriage, does not want affair. Eventually small-town sweet conquors big-city cynicism. I love the Grant/Day story, I did not love this."
3,Old School Dispensationalism Theology,"While a systematic theology may solve some problems it encourages laziness by those whop read the work. Too many rely on a systematic theology instead of studying scripture and taking the time to get the tools necessary for that task. Chafer is of the old school dispensationalism (Scofield, Larkin, and C. H. Mackintosh) and not the more recent progressive dispensationalism school of thought."
4,Awesome confirmation,"What Bill saw is confirmed in scripture. His personal experience helps to bring home the reality of the place called hell. I am so pleased he saw no children there.It would have been more helpful if the references etc had been collated at the end of the book instead of at the end of each chapter. It would also have been helpful if Bill had actually explained at the end of the book how people can make sure they do not end up in hell, i.e that they need to ask the Lord Jesus Christ to have mercy upon them, for there is no other Way."
1,Needed more minutes in Hell,"I was surprised at how quickly the author's journey to Hell was conveyed in the book. Suddenly he's in Hell - then he's at Jesus' feet - then he's back on earth. Considering what a rare opportunity it is to go to Hell and live to tell about it, I was hoping for more information.Regardless, I hope he's wrong. I can't imagine a God who would place his mortal children on earth for 70-100 earth years & then banish them to the Hell described for eternity. So basically the theory holds - the old lady down the road who never hurt a fly & left all her money to charity when she died is burning in a wretched pit of fire forever because she didn't become a christian. This book just solidifies this belief & I can't believe in a God who allows this (I know,...it's our ""choice""...sure)."
3,An ok book at best....,"Excellent service. The book was an ok book at best, it had more scripture than anything which is ok. It was more like reading the bible than reading a story."
2,23 minutes in hell,"I was actually quite disappointed in this book. I have read 23 minutes in heaven, which I found to be much better. Obviously the subject of location is different, but I didn't think the writer has a whole book of material here."
4,enlighting,"23 minutes in Hell is a must read for all people, after reading this book I'm more committed to telling people about the gospel, people are dying everyday and going to Hell because they haven't heard the truth. This book shows that hell is indeed a real place and that its eternal."
1,Not a believable story,"I absolutely despised ""23 Minutes in Hell."" The author claims to have descended to hell, describes what he saw and felt, and came back to earth and supposedly links it to all of the truths in the Bible. The only problem with all of this is that he prefaced all of his experiences with the Bible verse, and they were written verbatum. The author's style leaves each encounter to be questioned. Throughout the book I kept asking myself, ""why is he using verses he knows then describing it as his own experience?"" It all sounds like a guy who wanted to write a book the could change someone's religious views, but had nothing else to bring to the table except a made up story."
1,"Sorry, I don't trust the author's story. Maybe I know too much as an RN for 18 years.","Sorry but I don't believe this story...but the Christian doctrine is good.I've been a Christian for 45 yrs, an RN for 18. I was hoping to find out more about my God and more about hell by reading this book. It did NOT happen for me anyway. By the time I got past just the 5th page, I could no longer trust the author. Maybe I know too much about REAL near-death experiences as an RN. The good news is this, what he says about Jesus and the Bible was good to read about. Either an author is truthful or he is not. To me you can't be both. My take on this book, don't waste your time."
1,Deluded or lying,"I don't believe him. He takes many Biblical passages out of context, and sometimes says things that flatly contradict the Bible or other parts of his own account. He claims the experience was not just a dream, but doesn't explain why he has no physical effects of being burned, having his chest ripped open by demons, etc. During one of his church talks, he claims a sharp bit his leg and dragged him under water while he was surfing, but no marks whatsoever were left on his leg. Oh really? I think he's either deluded, or a liar."
1,How Sad,I just can't believe that people actually still believe in hell! What a small God these people have. When it says that people are in hell for various reasons - some because they've never heard of God - HELLO!!! That doesn't even make sense! What kind of God would send people to hell because they never heard of him? How can people be so stupid?! What kind of God would send ANYONE to hell? God loves everyone and everyone will have eternal life because of this eternal love. Why do we feel the need to continue to scare the hell (pun intended) out of people to get them to believe in a God of love? How sad.
2,As real as past-life memories,"Someone had a vision of hell...complete with full sensory activation. Very real. A genuine experience.Exactly like all those past-life memories countless people have had.So, why are many Christians so quick to believe this person's experience was genuine, but readily dismiss past-life experiences?"
2,very dissapointed,"I was very dissapointed in this book. I wished the author would of just told his story of what he experienced instead of adding ""preaching"" along the way or stories he's heard to compare to what he was going through. Also, adding scripture and quotes in the middle of his experience just makes it seem like his story is created or made up according to Bible quotes. Don't get me wrong, I believe what the Bible says but feel it could have been added in the end of the Chapter so the story is more fluid and not broken up. I think Hell is something alot of people have not taken alot of time to think about or believe it is actually real, this book does make you think and I certainly want to take every measure to not end up there.Not sure if I believe this happened but that doesn't really matter, what does matter is believing in God and living to His Word."
1,Worst book I ever read,It took me less than 23 minutes to go through this book and realize how bad it was. I don't believe in hell unless people themselves create one on earth.It seems like author's only mission was to scare the hell out of people reading it and truthfully no one in their sound mind would find his story even remotely believable.Smells like Dark ages and inquisition tales. Deleting this book from my collection.
1,A very silly story,"I think Bill probably believes he is being helpful by offering readers a view of what he considers to be hell. Its not helpful though to manufacture a silly story like this one. For anyone familiar with authentic accounts of 'out of body' or 'near death' experiences, Bill's fantasy is comical in its detail. If you manage to get past Bill's 'conversation' with Christ on page 33, where he explains why He arranged to have Bill flung naked into Hell, ask yourself if that is a Jesus Christ that you find believable."
3,Different perspective,"Did this book change my view on life, religion, and my own death? No, but I think if you are interested in the subject and want to hear other perspectives on hell. Then I recommend. The problem I had with this book was whether it is true or not it seems like he took the premise of Dante and made it his own, but I don't know what his true intention are or if this really happened so I will just take the book at face value and say that it didn't change my life and it was a short enough that I didn't feel like I was wasting my life either."
2,23 Minutes of Light Reading,"While I appreciate and respect the intent of the author, and his experience (I believe it is valid), the book could be edited to provide stronger ""what now"" for the non-Christian, seeker, individual."
2,dark book,"I assumed the writer would have had a more detailed account of his journey through hell. This book almost seemed fictious and was not clearly followed. I would not recommend anyone to purchase it. However, if you see it at your local library it could be food for thought."
5,Christians don't go to hell,"I find it hard to believe that God would contradict himself and send a Christian to hell even for a short time. John 3:16 ""For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten son. That whosoever believeth in Him shall not perish but have everlasting life.""Romans 10:9 ""That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved."""
1,Gollygeewillikers!,"This work serves as additional proof that Planet Earth is basically a gigantic, self-contained institution for the religiously insane."
4,Great reminder that we don't want to end up at this place!,"This is another way of God using earthly people to help spread the message of hope. Anyone who has questions if heaven and hell are real should read books like this..God allows experiences to happen to people so they can warn us of what is to come. Thank you for this reminder Bill Weiss. When you are done reading this book, read '90 Minutes in Heaven's by Don Piper."
4,Great Reminder!,"I had a hard time putting this book down. It is a quick read and a great reminder of what God says is to come. Especially chilling is the reality of the Bible descriptions of hell being literal, that this is really how bad it will be!"
5,23 Minutes in Hell,I am very happy with my purchase of the book 23 Minutes in Hell. It was a decent price. The book was in excellent condition. It was delivered to my home within 5 days. The book itself was excellent. I took it to the pool with me. I actually read it twice before I passed it along to my dauchter.
2,Fizzle,The title was intriguing. However the book was not. I have no problem with the belief in Hell. I think its there. I did not get a sense of it from this read. The second half was quite laborious. The use of KJV translation for all scripture references harkened back to the 1950's
2,"Fascinating in concept, but spiritually full of holes","Interesting book, and if the guy's right, something to work hard to avoid. That said, there are aspects (despite his quoting from scripture and theologians) that don't ring true from my reading, and the reliance on KJV quotes undercuts the supporting scriptures -- KJV is hardly a reliable translation no mattter how much I enjoy the sound of the KJV. All in all, worth a look if one is so inclined."
1,Interesting book,"I enjoyed the story, very well written as far as the description of his ordeal. But to take this seriously? LOL! It's called sleep paralysis! Some people get sexually molested by aliens, some envision going to Hell."
1,Gullible fools,"I can't believe people actually bought this book. If it is true as this author says that God sent him to hell so he can experience it to tell others why then does people have to pay to hear the message God wants them to hear? What this means is chances of a homeless person on the street being able to get this message are slim to none. Why do people always fall for these con artists...he's making millions by selling an experience that God wanted him to share??? Give me a break, this author and all his friends could all go to hell in my opinion."
1,Sacreligious,"Although I am no Bible scholar or theologian after only reading the first few pages of this book I could tell it was one of the most Biblicaly inaccurate books ever published. I find it ironic that on the night he compares the So. CA sunset to being heaven on earth he has an ""experience"" taking him to hell. Maybe he just drove to far and ended up in Nevada? I think he has baked his brain in the So CA desert to long and I can't believe people would believe Jesus would use a realator to deliver His message that can be found in any Bible. Where I come from most realators a crooks looking to make a quick buck anyway they can and it appears they are the same all over the U.S."
4,Believable,I believe this. I don't doubt for one second that the author experienced hell. I believe the Lord wanted the author to write this book to awaken a blind and sleepy world.Carrie Lynn JonesAuthor of:It All Began... When Jesus Gave Me Sneakers
1,Very disappointing,The book was a total let down. The amount of time dedicated to what the author actually saw and felt in hell was a very small part of this book. It was rather disjointed and extremely hard to get through. I definitely would not recommend this book to anyone.
3,Thank You!,"The seller was very efficient in delivery, I was happy to get the book in week.Bill Wiese depict his 23 minutes in hell very vividly over and over again that I was afraid that he will run out of words. I was so glad he didn't.I should read it again, I might have another take on it."
2,23 minutes,I was really not into this book. The experience was short and the description did not touch me. I was expecting more from this book.
1,fear mongering garbage,This book is yet another attempt to scare people into believing in and adopting the christian belief. Anyone with a brain who can think independently of the weak minded will also hate this book. A total waste of money and time.
4,Book: 23 Minutes in Hell,"Not yet finished with the book, but it is a good book overall. The author describes his experience in hell in detail, which sometimes becomes creepy but it is true.Great book for sinners and non-believers in Jesus Christ to read. It really opens your eyes and makes you appreciate The Lord's love and forgiveness of our sins."
1,Pathetic!,Don't waste your time on this book. His journey to Hell takes about 5 minutes to read - the rest is bible verse.This book is poorly written drivel and not worth spending money on.
4,hmm..,"I, like the person under me, also finished this book in two sittings. This book will make you think. Many times while reading it, I was a bit skeptical as to if it was just a dream, or if it really happened to this man. I have to remind myself that with God all things are possible. However, there are false teachers in the world, so we have to read books such as this with discernment. But overall, the guy seemed pretty believable. And even if it's not real(which I kinda doubt..), I'd still suggest picking up this book. It's a quick read, and pretty interesting. You'll have to make your own conclusion on it."
1,Not a NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCE,"The author did not have a documented near death experience (NDE). A documented NDE means that a doctor pronounced or verified this person was legally dead or had died and was revived. How else can you scientifically prove to the reader the experience was real? There are other writers who have had documented ""NDE"" and have unbiased stories to tell about the hell experience. This author quotes scripture A LOT and how it relates to his hell or really bad dream. I personally do not believe his story. I feel I wasted my money!"
1,BEWARE,"I have a major issue with this book: Beware of anyone other than Jesus Christ who claims to have descended into hell, and arose from the dead."
1,Can't believe that so many others are giving this book good ratings!!!,"The author cannot express himself except to say that his experience is worst than the worst you can ever imagine. I'm an opened minded person and I love reading about people's personal experiences at certain particularly important moments of their lives, but this book is beyond what any ""grounded"" individual can accept as being even partially true!In fact, at the moment of a traumatic event, the human spirit and mind becomes instictive and does not begin to formulate ideas and recollect images and events until it has registered and understood its surroundings, none of which can occur in less than 23 minutes.I think that I would have had a better experience reading this if the author was upfront and honestly classified this as a work of fiction."
5,Wonderful Read,"For the naysayers who believe that God is only a cuddly teddy bear and that no one will experience a hell, then you have missed much of what the Bible has to say concerning it. Bill Wiese brings this out in this page turner of a book. No, Bill Weiss is not a theologian, but then neither were the Apostles that Jesus chose to lead the early church. 12 ordinary men with no special religious backgrounds. Bill Weiss also doesn't need to be an Apostle to have and experience such as this and write about it.To the one reviewer who talked about Lazarus, I will tell you that the Lazarus mentioned in Luke who was in the bosom of Abraham and the one Jesus raised from the dead were two different individuals who just happened to have the same name.I highly recommend this book. Even if it were fiction, which I do not believe it is, I would still recommend it because it is scripturally based.Rev. Carl Kaspick, MDivThe Keepers Outreach Ministries"
5,An Experience I Won't Soon Forget...,"I consider myself a fair reader of literature, but I have yet to read a book that has had the effect on me as this one has. I was half way through it before being aware of the time. I've read several testimonies of (and about) men and women that have departed this life and found themselves in that Great Abyss called HELL and returned to tell about it. The author's experience is different in that he places the reader along side himself experiencing it as well. Needless to say, I didn't sleep very well that night. Not for myself as I'm a Christian but for all the people I come in contact with everyday who I know... haven't made Jesus as their Lord.This book will wake up the Dead. I know because I've left it to where anybody could read it and for those that did, their reading experience was similar. A great witnessing tool.I gave it 5 stars just for that reason."
5,Paints a Good Picture,"Everyone knows that hell is bad and not a place that you'd want to be. This book describes one man's experience in hell in a descriptive manner. He doesn't take a ""repent now or forever suffer!"" approach. The author is down to earth and simply sharing his experience. I read this book slowly and carefully as he described the pains felt in hell, which really helped me to more fully appreciate what being there might be like.Although it's a relatively short book and not a terribly long description of hell itself, it's informative nonetheless and helped me to appreciate the phrase ""I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy""."
4,The first half of the book,"The first half of the book, he tells of his experience. I started to read some other reviews, but decided not to. Whether this man has an insightful imagination or this happened for real, I cannot distinguish. But, what I can affirm is some of his wording when he talks with God and how God answers him. I know this to be true. God answers before we get the question completely out. This man's claim sounds enough far fetched that it could be from God, for he works in ways in the bible that sounds illogical. One instance the walls falling down with sounds and yelling, and the walls drive themselves down into the earth instead of falling over. I think the unsaved should listen closely and repent, as for the church goers who lacks belief, I hope you're saved as well, for if one reads the bible they will find records of this man's account closely rendered as the same or close parallels."
5,Quite Convincing,This is a convincing story of a man who was showed the horrors of Hell by God Himself. 23 Minutes in Hell by Bill Wiese takes you on a journey into Hell and explains all the frightfulness he experienced. Hopefully Wiese s' detailed description of this abhorrent place will make people think twice.
4,23 minutes in Hell book,The book was very interesting and for a nonbeliever it should wake them up to the fact that it is a terrible place without our Lord.
2,Lord have mercy on us all,"This gave me nightmares. Thank God, I am and always will belong to our Lord Jesus. For the Lord is our Shepherd and I am one of his flock."
3,hell,It was a great presentation but didn't agree with all his descriptions but it does make you want to get your heart right with Jesus.
5,Good fire alarm,this book is an interesting account of a short but difficult experience; I appreciated the way the author solemnly exhorts people to consider their eternal destiny.
5,Really makes you think about your life....,"A detailed view of what he saw in hell and how it correlates with what is said in the Bible. Almost ""Scared Straight"" type information. Makes a person take stock in what they do in everyday life. Highly recommend this book."
1,"The biggest fraud out there, but sweet as a horror story.","I am a christian. I believe in God, and I believe in hell. I read this when I was a teenager, and if anything, It made me want to run from God. This is such a fraud. It makes the guy money, and scares some people into living like somebody says they should. Good for him. This is the most disturbing pile of crap I've ever read... unless you're looking for a horror story. In that case, nobody could do it better."
3,So SO,"I purchased this book because my mom wanted me to read it. I really only wanted to hear about the experience, not why he decided to tell the world. The more I read the more I was convinced it wasnt real."
1,To hell and back,"For those of you who do not have time to read Dante's Inferno comes ""23 Minutes In Hell""...A heavy thunder breaks the deep lethargy within your head.......causing you to upstart suddenly, like a person who by force is awakened. Before you stands an enormous gate with an inscription that reads:""Through me the way into the suffering city,Through me the way to the eternal pain,Through me the way that runs among the lost.Justice urged on my high artificer;My maker was divine authority,The highest wisdom, and the primal love.Before me nothing but eternal things were made,And I endure eternally.Abandon every hope, ye who enter here."""
1,23 Minutes In Hell,I was suppose to have received this book by October 28th.I am still waiting for it to arrive so I can't give it a good review
1,Waste of money,"And all the people before JC was born are not saved or are not included somehow and all must be burning in hell? Think about all the people that have lived and died before 2000 years ago that knew nothing of Christianity. That is a lot of souls may they R.I.P. I'm a beleiver but this view point is ridiculous and cost YOUR money to just to find that out. Move on, I highly recommend the 'Seat of the soul' circa 1996-97 and 'Back to Godhead' if you want to learn more about your soul, otherwise treat your people and world with reverence and you'll be fine."
1,To hell and back,"Im in the process of reading this book, and all as I can say is: I think the guy had a bad LSD trip! Didn't John Lennon take this ride a number of years ago?????"
2,"Maybe he did, maybe he didn't","I don't know if this guy went through this or not but, as a few have pointed out, there are some red flags here. Who are all these tortured people? I believe the bible says all the unrepentant are reserrected at the beginning of 1,000 years of peace & given another chance BEFORE they're judged. I also believe I've already caught this guy in a lie. I think he says in the book he wasn't a devoted Christian before this experience but I saw him on TV & he said he had been. The fact he uses so much scripture is also a little strange, almost like he's trying a little TOO hard to make his point.I want to leave everyone reading this some advice I SERIOUSLY suggest you take, religious or not. Go to www.the-end.com and download or order for FREE a book called 2008: God's Final Witness & have everyone you know read it. The author claims to be one of God's final 2 end-time prophets & I believe him. Apparently, Jesus IS coming VERY soon. It may save your life & those you love."
1,Rubbish,"Descriptions are vague, cliche, and/or patronizing. Accounts of conversations with God seem ridiculous (unless the author is just plain awful at paraphrasing).This book is not convincing, in the slightest - not to mention written very poorly. Go ahead and buy it - just to see for yourself. As a matter of fact, you can have my copy."
4,worth a look,"The first thing noticeable about this book is that it is written in 'layman's' voice so don't expect a well written novel. That being said, that may be what lends credibility to the account told. It is however interwoven with scripture references which are almost to 'like'. The reader may begin to get the impression that it was the scripture that gave rise to the story and not the experience that prompted further investigation. All tolled, it is a very compelling account, or story, whichever the reader may deem, and worth the time to read."
2,Entertaining fiction,"I gave it 2 stars because it is an entertaining piece of fictional writing. Unfortunately, the author believes every word he wrote as true and tells people the experience he supposedly had is true. Such public statements make him either delusional or a fraud. Of course, we all have to take his word for it, and believe him. This book serves 2 purposes. First, it reinforces devout Christians (of course not any other religion) of the rightness of their absolute unsubstantiated faith. Second, it attempts to use fear as a means to convince non-believers to submit to religious authority starting with the belief that you are inherently evil from birth and deserve eternal torture. Kind of gives you a warm and fuzzy feeling inside doesn't it?"
1,Hell No,There is no hell. Only people who harp on it. And then there are those who want to capitalize on it.
1,Pure tripe - unrefined,"If you buy the notion that Bill Wiese is not just describing a bad acid trip then you deserve to wade through his vapid twaddle, most of which sounds like it was cribbed from some 'Sermon-Matic' software product."
3,HELL is Real,"Interesting book.I like to progress through the story without referencesuntil the end. The Author may or may not have visited this place,but forthose who are not Christian and who read the book out of curiosity,it maybe a little hard to swallow.This is not to say that it does not hold interest..only that it doent answer ALL questions."
5,Beautiful and Real,"The lyrics in this albumn were so deep and real. This guy opens up about the love he had and the love he lost. You can tell that through each song, his broken heart healed more. It truly celebrates the beauty of love and the resilience of life. He sings about the feelings that everyone has but hides to try to keep their pride and dignity. The first time I listened to the albumn, I felt like I was experiencing it. Number 5 is my favorite song."
5,Atmosphere and then some,"This excellent book takes the reader right into the life of a number of people inhabiting the town of Mont St.-Michel, including a man who is one of the guardians of the abbey complex. Anyone interested in the Mont will find the author's ability to convey both atmosphere and sense of despair captivating. And despite what another reviewer has said, there is indeed a plot: the protagonist's attempt to deal with what life has dealt him. This is literature with a capital L."
1,THIS BOOK HAS NO PLOT!!!!!!!!,"The title makes the book sound interesting but it most definitely is not! I guess I should note that I read the translated version, so, it is possible that the translator missed some information (which would make him a complete idiot). Much, in fact, too much of the book is spent describing the architecture of Mont St.-Michel. That's fine if you like that sort of thing, but I did not decide to read this book for that purpose. I decided to read this book because I thought/expected (judging from the title anyway) a story of some sort was going to unfold before my eyes. I was absolutely wrong! There is some antagonism between the characters that initially makes you think the ""story"" is leading up to something, but it's not. This has to be one of the dullest, if not THE dullest, books ever written."
4,good album,"A very good album with a mixture of hip-hop and r&b old school and new. nice mixes at some points too. with good tracks such as ""how many licks"" ""afro puffs"" ""hiphop hooray"" and the biggest classic on this cd ""california love"" from the legandary tupac shakurthis album comes across strong on the hip hop side. on the R&B side it doesnt dissapoint either with songs such as jahiem ""just in case"" and also the mix of damages ""so what if i"" is a nice touch too.on the whole you wont be dissapointed in buying this album it is one you can listen to mostly all the way through some tracks are annoying such as ""lapdance"" but the rest is a very peasin performance"
4,hair clippers,I gave it as a Christmas present for my grandson he were his hair very short and he loved it
5,Nice product for home use.,This Andis trimmer is perfect for home use. This is my second purchase of this product. The first one is still going strong after almost two years of consistent use. I recommend this product.
1,TOO HOT TO HANDLE!,"When cutting my own hair, these clippers got too hot to hold way too fast and I began to see smoke coming from them as I was cutting my hair"
1,just awful. dangerous even.,"During the first hair cut, the clippers started SMOKING. I immediately unplugged it and unscrewed the cover to find the plastic pieces melting into the wires. Not even returning it, threw it promptly in the trash. I wouldn't even give it one star, but I digress."
3,fine for a backup,"These clippers were a part of my beauty school supplies. Using them on one men's haircut after another, they last for about three without a long resting time. Taking into consideration that I'm taking a considerable amount of time on each haircut, that's very good for the listed price. If you clean it properly with the brush and use the oil every once in a while, it should even last years. Yes, it does get hot. Yes, it does get caught on knots. Yes, it works. If you want something amazing, buy a better model. My opinion is that for all of the pieces you get in this kit...this is a great deal."
1,"Will tear out your hair, not cut it.",After only 2 uses these clippers feel as thought they are years old. They pull out your hair rather than cut it. Would not recommend.
5,good construction,"Bought with the drum for my son. He totes it around in his car, so the bag made sense. The straps make the awkward shaped drum easy to carry."
3,it is ok,"took a very long time to arrive. when seeing the box I had thought it was trash , however nothing wrong with vhs it is old and worn but you get what you pay for and I did get what I paid for."
3,Scream: The beginning,"While this is not by any means a great film, it does attempt to combine humor and horror in a way that predates the more famous ""Scream"". The film allows the characters to understand that they may be involved in a ""horror film"" plot and thus they attempt to act accordingly. Many of the jokes fall flat and the film as a whole is essentially a set-up for the fairly amusing payoff ending. For an early eighties ""gore"" film there is not much blood and those seeking such should look elsewhere. It is rather humorous to see an actor of George Clooney's ""stature"" earning his wings in this low budget horror. Overall, if you are up for a minor piece of fluff on a boring Saturday night, this will fit the bill. The DVD picture is good, a trailer is included but there are no other extras. A rental at best."
3,fun,"This campy movie is not one to analize but to just sit back and enjoy. We know what happened to George Clooney after ""Horror High"" but where is Brendan Hughes?"
1,not good..,"I was disappointed in this movie, because I thought it would be alot like ""Cheerleader Camp"" it was awful, boring, and slow moving...I ended up trading it in..."
1,Horrible,"Horrible, to say the least. I am a b movie horror fan, but I can say that this one was rated F. I only paid a few dollsrs for it and that is what it was worth. The ""special effects"" were horrible, the acting, down right terrible. This is only my opinion, watch it for yourself and see.Also the ending confused the heck out of me. Rent before you buy. Or buy it from me, I'll give it to you free."
2,read this,well this is the only review ive ever written but i wanted to write one on this movie. i love movies that appear to be like this one but i just have to say that this movie is a little too confusing at times.
1,A stinker!,"In 1982 Cripptenton High was the scene of a series of graphic murders and the school was shut down since with the killer vanished, 4 years later a group of Hollywood filmmakers such as a director (Scott Jacoby) and a sleazy producer (Alex Rocco) with a group of actors and actresses who return to that high school to film the movie, however the killer is still alive and is creating more bodies to drop than ever.A smelly attempt to be a horror comedy but falls flat on it's act! despite the presence of George Clooney in one of his film debuts and Maureen McCormick, this one is a terrible and poorly acted piece of crap with no logic, no scares and unfunny attempts to be comedy at times. Your better off with ""Scream"" if you want a self-referential horror film done correctly, avoid this at all costs.This DVD has a fair transfer with some miminal grain at times and the sound is good but the only extra thing is the trailer."
1,"Call it whatever you want, it's still low grade junk","After watching this one again all I can say is, WOW at what point in making this turkey did they decide to get rid of the script. Really, this makes little or no sense. To bad to be a slasher movie, not funny enough to be a comedy, and that leaves the public holding this bag of cheese.A film crew is shooting a horror movie at an old High School where,you guessed it,where years before several murders happened,and yeah sure enough the killings start all over again or are they just a stunt to get publicity for the movie. I dare you to care as it grows dumber with each passing scene. Save your money"
4,saw it live,"I was at this show, and loved it. Obviously, I am a fan, or I would not have bought tickets.Interesting thing about the show - it happened on Feb 13, the day after a massive snow storm moved over the entire state. But the show was sold out.I know some complained about Maher not being as funny as he once was. And though this may be somewhat true, I have to say that I didn't go because I was expecting a laugh a minute evening. Maher isn't exactly a comic anymore. He is a commentator who uses satire to make his points. And I tend to agree with many of them. This wasn't the blue collar comedy tour, this wasn't Robin Williams. This was Bill Maher, doing an extended version of what he does on his HBO show. And that's what I like."
4,Tells it like it is,"I actually stumbled on this at the library by accident, after watching Religulous and enjoying it I decided to give this a shot.What I found was something very similar to Robin Williams, Live on Broadway(which I also enjoyed)Topics such as Religion, Government, Politions, the Recession, the 2012 Election, as well as cheating scandles are covered in a humorous way.While it may not be a laugh a min. it is definitly funny with some great material by Bill Maher."
5,Typical Maher,"If you like Bill Maher, this DVD is for you. If you don't like Bill Maher but enjoy talking back to a DVD or enjoy being agitated by his views so you can blow off steam to your friends about what he says, this DVD is for you. If you can't stand Bill Maher you might want to buy this DVD anyway just to reinforce your negative attitude towards this clever, irreverant comedian who picks up where George Carlin left off."
4,You can't be wrong!,"I'm a fan of Bill Maher and I enjoyed every second of it, in ""But I'm not wrong"" he talks, laughs and points the finger at his favorite subjects: religion, republicans and idiocy you won't be dissapointed"
3,"Yea, yea, we get it","Maher is an intelligent guy who even if you don't agree with his politics frequently makes you say to yourself ""wow....I never quite looked at it like that."" Unfortunately here, he mostly just rants and it's not that funny. We get it Bill....you hate Bush, Sarah Palin and religion. Don't need to spend 45 minutes on it. It's all been done."
2,Too Much Smut,"He should grow up and stop with the ""fu..._"" word in every other sentence. His humor is getting to be disgusting."
1,A complete waste of time,"I saw this pathetic perfomance on TV. So, it was not necessary to flush my money down the toilet. Thanks, HBO! An interesting fact: this limousine liberal crudely mocked all major religions, except one. Any guesses?"
3,False Advertisement?,"Most if not all claimed two-way radio ranges are based on the ability of radios on calm, flat ocean water on a clear day. To truly test a ""15-mile range,"" one would need to simulate the aforementioned conditions. I agree that it's an underhanded marketing tool, but keep it in mind when making any radio purchase."
1,"very bad things,,,,",its not true that its distance is 20 miles its only working within 2 miles. its very bad.
3,Charming,"This is a charming little story, with a little of the hardships of the time. No, this is not Ms. Garlock's best... and no, there is not quite enough emotional conflict to carry the story for the 343 pages. However, it is a sweet story. If you're looking for a simple story without too much conflict, this is it!Cherish spends the entire book letting Sloan determine the route of the relationship, and giving into his every whim. Unlike most of Ms. Garlock female characters, Cherish is quite dependent on Sloan. Otherwise, it's a good story."
3,"Predictable, cliched, but interesting in a dumb way","I've read some of Dorothy Garlock's later books and they were pretty good, so I was kind of surprised at this silly inane story. But it was kind of interesting in a mindless way, so go figure. Really predictable, the heroine is a total goody two-shoes blond blue-eyed constantly sniveling but brave bombshell, and the hero the perfect male specimen (gentle but strong in a perfect sort of way) stud Dudley Do-right. Of course there's a typical side-kick guy Pierre who talks funny and an evil Other Woman who hurt the sensitive hero's feelings a while back. An OK book for a total brain vacation."
4,Great but not long on plot...,Charming fast read. Not Mrs. Garlock's best but not bad. I like the time period just wish the book had a little more substance.
1,(yawn),"Dorthy Garlock's Love and Cherish has an insipid meandering excuse for a plot. She drudges along a well worn path through historical romanance: the lovely but tiny young maid falls in love with the huge life-harden man and in turn wins his heart. I love a good roamance with a happy ending, but this is entirely too predictable. The dialogue is so honeyed, it is laughable. If this book is publishable, we should all give writing a book a try!"
1,Do NOT buy paperback version!,"The paperback version of this book is a complete waste of your money. It appears to be a photo-copied hardback book, but the pages are terrible! They vary from slightly blurry to completely black. DO NOT BUY!"
3,Very helpful,This is a very helpful book and would suggest that anyone who is interested in any navigation coastal or deep sea.
5,essential,"anyone know where I can get a usable copy of the ""old"" Bowditch VOL II Pub 9 1981 edition...STRIKEFLYNN @ aol.com is looking"
3,Not good for kids < 10 or so,"The first example is of a loved family pet having been so badly hurt that it needs to be put to sleep. I hoped my 8 year old might have read this book, but she'd be too upset by that confrontational ethical issue. Maybe when she's 10 or older. My girl is enamoured with her little cat, and reading a story about one being put down would upset her more than the benefit of the lesson could bring. The author could have picked a less upsetting ethical situation."
2,Not Petrella's best,"Fonit has done a wonderful job in cleaning up the sound on this 1954 ""Butterfly"". The cast is variable: Clara Petrella, the ""Duse of Opera"", was somewhat miscast as this operas vulnerable heroine. Her voice is too mature and forceful and her attempts at characterization don't come off. She was much better portraying ""fallen women"" such as Nedda and Manon Lescaut. Ferruccio Tagliavini still had full control of his beautiful pianissimo and he uses it to great effect at the beginning of the love duet. At times, however, he seems to be stressed by Angelo Questa's brisk tempi. The real star of this recording is Giuseppe Taddei. He captures the essence of Sharpless and is able to scale his sizeable voice down for the intimate letter scene with Butterfly.While there is much to recommend this recording, this opera's success depends on it's heroine and, unfortunately, Petrella falls somewhat short of the mark."
4,Just the right pair!,"I recieved a pair of these earrings for my birthday {Jan}, garnet is my birthstone. They are lovely, and I wear them all the time. The earrings are light-weight that they don't pull on my ears, and short enough that they don't appear too dress. Definely a pair of earrings you can wear with jeans, or a dress!"
3,"Enjoyable, but not their best work","I first heard this recording when I bought a boxed set of 6 King's Singers CDs, and given the repertoire on the album, I actually though I would enjoy it more than what I did. There's nothing actually bad about it, but I thought they could have made more of the songs, particularly Vincent and The Sound of Silence. This recording is accompanied by an orchestra, something which the King's Singers don't do that often, but the actual orchestration on this CD is very well done. Although I still personally believe that their best work has always been a cappella. Nonetheless, one of the things I appreciate most about the King's Singers is their ability to perform an extremely diverse repertoire, and that fact alone still makes this album worthwhile. My favourite tracks are Simon Smith, Bridge Over Troubled Water, and It's Lonely at the Top."
5,Tha BOMB,Non-stop relentless house. This is soo damn catchy. Everyone I know loves this. Money well spent.
3,dissapointing,"When I first found out that Terry Mullan had a CD out, I immediately went out to buy it. When I got it home & started listening to it, my heart sank from the dissapointment of it. I am a long time fan of Terry Mullan's & remember when I would go to a party or club just because I knew he would be spinning. His VERY mainstream style on this CD just is not the Terry Mullan that I know & love. This is a GOOD CD. Overall, I'd say that if you have ever heard Terry Mullan work his magic back in 95-97 then buy the CD, you'll LOVE it. But if you are a long time fan as I am, don't let yourself suffer the dissapointent."
1,You get what you pay for,"How hard is it to make a chess game that works? This is the worst game I have ever purchased, and I hope this helps someone else from making the same mistake. Terrible graphics, terrible setup and not user friendly! Don't wast your money."

4,Gierach comes up with another winner.,"What can you say about a well crafted collection of Gierach stories?There aren't enough of them...But, John has to gather material so he can't write all the time. This is another little gem that whizzes by in far too short a time. In all fairness it's about the same length of all of the Gierach books -- he just leaves you wanting more.Well, the Arkansas is running 450 cfs and I have to go..."
4,Don't know why I enjoy him so much,"This guy is a classic self-indulgent leftover Hippie. But he captures the essence of flyfishing, and the outdoors in general, in a most compelling way. His life view is a delightful antidote to the urbanized, ""Orvisized"", SUV'ed approach to the sport (or art form) called flyfishing. I REALLY enjoy reading him (though I would prefer that he not be allowed to vote)."
2,Disappointing,"Sr. Miño (b. 1949) is an excellent guitarist from Seville, particularly noted for performing with his wife, dancer Pepa Montes. I saw them together at a festival in Palma del Río once, and of all the performers that evening they impressed me the most.Unfortunately, this album does not — for me, anyway — capture what Miño is capable of. For one thing, the recording is very old (1976). The playing (as often, regrettably, happens in the antiseptic atmosphere of a recording studio) is stiff, nervous and inhibited, and shows an alarming tendency to slide towards the classical; although (as one would expect) there are good musical ideas.The total time is 45'09"""
3,One Of The Few Recordings of Marie Collier,"Marie Collier, who died tragically young, under mysterious circumstances, had a beautiful voice, solid technique, dramatic commitment and a beautiful stage presence. She made only a handful of recordings, but had huge successes at Covent Garden and the Met. This English language set of highlights from MADAMA BUTTERFLY may not be the best way to judge her work. (There is a remarkable video of her in the big scene from Act II of TOSCA with Tito Gobbi ,(she is even more intense than Callas !) that is worth seeking out.), She reveals genuine involvement with Butterfly's character,perfect English diction,and sings like an angel. Charles Craig in mid-career is also a wonderful Pinkerton.Characteristically good early 1960's sound from EMI."
3,Railroads In US History,"You should be careful with this item. I ordered this ""set"" and only received Program disk #1, NOT the complete set of 4 or 5 disks. The one disk had already been opened, and was NOT in ""new"" condition. This must be from an ""outside vendor"", so make sure you really want to buy this item.The show itself is for a ""school"" setting, and not targeted at a recreational market. Interesting if I was in high school. I only wish we had shows like this back then."
1,SHORT ON MONEY?,"THIS ALBUM IS ALRIGHT IF SOMEBODY GIVES IT TO YOU, BUT I PERSONALLY WOULDN'T SPEND A CENT ON IT."
5,The most memorable book from my childhood!,"My daughter and I read this book a few times each week. It was a gift from my sister to me for one of my early birthdays, and I knew this book by heart while growing up. Now my daughter does too. It has a great lesson about the consequences of disobeying a parent without too much ""lesson"". Just enough to let a child know it makes a mommy or daddy sad when they don't listen to them; it's a great way for a child to remember that ""no"" isn't what you tell a parent.I cherish this book, and am about to order another copy just ""in case""!!!"
1,"""The King's Singers: Not Well Connected""","I am someone who has enjoyed The King's Singers for years. I have previously found their range and choices of material to be interesting and rewarding. This album however, was a disappointment. Their voices did not seem suited to the Beatles music, and the arrangements did not serve The King's Singers or The Beatles well.My suggestion: you may want to skip this one."
3,Beatle Hootenanny,"As an inveterate Beatles' fan, I admit I am very picky when it comes to Beatle covers. However, as far as cover versions go, this one is decent. The voices harmonize well and, objectively speaking are good. This collection is like a folk hootenanny treatment of the Beatles' classics.The only arrangement I didn't like was ""A Hard Day's Night."" I felt it deviated from the standard Beatle format and I also didn't like the tempo of this arrangement. I would have preferred that the background singing on ""Help!"" had been omitted; I felt it ""cluttered"" the song.All in all, decent. It is what it is - cover versions of timeless Beatle classics. ""You've Got to Hide Your Love Away"" was the best performed song on this collection. If you like folk as I do and you enjoy a good hootenanny as I do, then you might enjoy this one."
2,"Okay, but not necessarily a unisex read...","Her stories have a rating system in them from PG-13 to XXX. If the stories arent the X or higher they tend to be slow and boring... not quite the erotic reads they should have been. Don't get me wrong, I've read stories that have been erotic without being XXX. But these don't cut it.The Second problem I have is that many of her stories almost drip with contempt for males. Why is it lesbian fiction should contain contempt for males? Are all lesbians male hating radicals. Well, none of the ones I know personally are, but to much lesbian fiction, erotic or otherwise, seems to portray this. That belongs in a political or philosophical treatise, not in something that is supposed to contain erotic fiction. If it weren't for some of the stories being really steamy, I would have given this book 1 star just on that alone. It really detracts from the mood of the story."
3,Pretty good,Cracking the Parenting Code: 6 Clues to Solving the Mystery of Meeting Your Child's NeedsSimplistic and easy to read!
1,John Boy Walton orders a new home from Sears & Roebuck,This book was as useless as the German version of Strarwars that I received on Amazon
1,icky,"i'm not an expert. but truthfully, i haven't yet heard OC do anything appreciaBLE past 1970. let me know if there is anything out there that might change my mind. for methany, who is firmly grounded in contemporary music, this is just a very distasteful balk, an anomoly. (that record with haynes and holland didn't do it for me either)"
1,Sorry. I just can't listen to this...,"I am a big Pat Metheny fan, but I just can't listen to this. I tried to on several different occasions, but I had to shut it off.Listen to some of the samples, and you will hear for yourself.If you are looking to begin a Pat Metheny collection, stay away from this CD. Start with any of the following: Letter From Home, Speaking of Now, TRIO 99-00, Quesion and Answer, Rejoicing, Secret Story, First Circle, New Chautauqua, or just about anything other than this."
1,Saxophonic hangover,"I had the misfortune of getting this album automatically for forgetting to return a&^$%^$#@ing Columbia House card. As a budding professional saxophonist, I listened out of curiosity, and couldn't make it through the album. Forget about what the pointy-headed jazz critics say. This album sounds like a saxophonist playing during a grand mal seizure. The in-your-face dissonance sounds like pure chaos. It's the kind of thing you listen to if you are shooting several pedestrians with a high-powered rifle.I've often wondered what the response of jazz critics would be if they ever heard me blow a whole bunch of random notes with an air of conviction during a performance. They would proabably think ""God, that's deep! SO emotive!"" Forget it. It's a bunch of crap. The emperor has no clothes."
1,consign to the trash can,"listen all you fans of the great O.C. out there, avoid this awful noise. it needs a government health warning! much as i love ornette's playing this is unworthy of his supreme talents. sorry folks its just plain ugly. perhaps ornette had a migraine at these sessions?"
1,my opinion that's all,"Having heard Pat's work with Joni Mitchell, ""Pat's Solo"" off Shadows and Light, for example I bought this thinking it would be similar in style. How wrong can you be? Of course now with the internet and all I would have had a listen before buying it, but back then I just took a chance. I can remember now when I put it on the turntable and dropped the arm onto the record. Oh my word there are no words to describe it. I can't listen to it. Sometimes I try to describe how awful it is to my jazz loving friends and they think I'm exaggerating, then I play it to them. The look on their faces is priceless. Seriously you need to hear it before you buy. I know this gets five stars off some reviewers, they must know something I don't. It's just my opinion, that's all"
2,"Good Movie, Not-Great Picture, [Poor] sound","The sound is the main problem with this DVD edition of Chino (that and the fact the film is presented ""full screen""). The picture is about as good as it would be on an average vhs tape, but the sound is sometimes muffled, sometimes echoing--so much so in parts that it sounds as if they just played the film in a big room and recorded the soundtrack with the mic on a cheap boombox. But the movie itself is very good.And to make up for the sound quality, this DVD offers an episode of Bronson's 1950's TV show, ""Man with a Camera,"" unavailable anywhere else (for now).So, for [price range], yes. For [price]--don't bother."
3,A review,"I've like Charles Bronson ever since I saw him in Dirty Dozen. This DVD consists of Chino and Man with a camera. Chino is a well made film with Bronson as a half-indian horse rancher. It features beautiful horses and a lot more. This important film in his career is also known as Valdez, the half-breed. The other three important characters that is a teenage runaway is played by Vincent Van Patten, Maral, a wealthy breedy by Marcel Bozzuffi and his sister is played by Jill Ireland. Man with a Camera is a b/w TV preogramme. In it is a young Charles Bronson playing Mike Kovac, a photographer. It is an interesting TV presentation. This DVD also contains and introduction by the great Tony Curtis and an original trailer for Kid Galahad starring the King, Elvis Prestley."
4,Awesome~,"I think that this album is one of Sloan's best, if not, THE best. It has the perfect amount of up-tempo songs, and the mellow, heartfelt ones. ""Bells On"" and ""Loosens"" have to be some of my all time favorite songs, while ""Coax Me"" and ""Deeper Than Beauty"" have always been high on my list! One disappointment, however, was ""Before I Do"" that starts out awesome but takes a million years to end, resulting in a track over 7 minutes long. This is a minor detail in an amazing CD that I would listen to over and over!"
3,Okay,"Great idea. Arrived in great shape. The book is smaller than I thought it would be. Also, the illustrations are so crowded that it didn't seem to follow the lyrics of the song very well. I would like my niece to be able to see the actions of the characters and follow along with the song, but it doesn't really do that."
3,Paperback is a bad idea; hold out for a board book,"We love this story/song and illustrations. Raffi's The Wheels On The Bus is without a doubt my youngest child's favorite book ever. When we lost our board book copy, I wanted to replace it. I couldn't find another board book so I ordered this. In this paperback version, the pictures are a little larger, and that's nice. But toddlers can't turn the pages themselves, and the pages won't stay open. Wish I had held out for a board book rather than buying this paperback."
5,"Excellent book, still entertaining 6 months later!","My 22 month old son still thoroughly enjoys this book, six months later. The words to this song/story are so engaging, they are the things that naturally catch a child's eye and ear-- windshield wipers, bus doors, baby's crying, parents shushing! My son initially enjoyed the whole book. Then, about 15 months, did not want to hear the part about the baby crying! Then resumed liking the whole book but more due to the details in the pictures. The illustrations are superb. Again, it is everything that captures a young toddlers exploration of their world--closed umbrellas opening upon raindrops falling, hands waving, money being exchanged, letters being mailed, how noise (horns, crying, hushing) can startle, capture attention, and calm. My son has pointed out the smallest details in this book...the bus being empty and full, the bus sign, the market produce, etc. I love Raffi's CD's and this book!"
5,Just perfect and makes a great gift!,"I teach First Grade and I keep several versions of The Wheels on the Bus in my classroom, but this one is by far the favorite of my students. I use the paperbacked book at school, and we have the board book at home. My daughters love it and we have read it daily for over 2 years.A gift giving suggestion: Fisher-Price's Little People School Bus and ""Barney's Adventure Bus"" video, to go along with the Wheels on the Bus book! Would be appreciated by both boys and girls. All 3 are wildly popular at my house, and I've given the 3 (bus, book, and toy) several times and it's been a huge hit every time."
3,I'd like to give this book 5 stars...,"This has been one of my son's favorite books to have sung/read since he was 11 months old-- he frequently picks it off the shelf, and prefers to hear it sung three times in a row! The illustrations are filled with details that reward close inspection. But as we sing this book more and more often it's the lack of diversity that's bothering me enough to knock off 2 stars... everyone in the quaint little town is Caucasian. Having lived in several quaint little towns myself (both here and abroad), I'd rather that art imitate life a little bit more closely, and show a less homogeneous population!"
4,Loved by my 18 month old,"My 18 month old LOVES this book. Puppies, ducks, babies, umbrellas. The hand motions (signs) we made up to go with each verse make it even more fun.I agree the only thing I dont like about this book is that the baby is pacified with a bottle."
2,Pacifier and bottle - I'd rather see some breastfeeding,"This board book illustrates the catchy tune, ""Wheels on the Bus"". I haven't been able to read it without singing it! However, I did not care for the illustrations in this version. The style was fine - soft colors in a European city - but the content was disappointing. For example, there is a young girl with a very sour expression, sticking her tongue out at her mother and other passengers. Yuck. In addition, the baby on the bus appears to lose the pacifier in her mouth during the ""up and down"" and cries until Mama gives her a bottle. Shouldn't Mama be nursing her baby? With so many excellent books out there, I would skip this one and sing the song with your little one while spinning your hands around, jumping up and down, and acting out the song."
5,One of the best ...,"A great selection of Aaron Copland composition, played by a great orchestra, excellent recording, and a solid mastering to SACD. Each instrument sounded crisp, and one of the best dynamic range recording I've heard. Even the CD version sounded great. I would highly recommend this."
5,great gift,Xmas gift that has the cool factor of the retro-wide leather wristband and an easy to read dial. My son loves it and his friends want it.
4,Great looking watch....,"Well i bought this item a month ago and i got really happy when i saw it, great looking with a rockish/aviator style i love it. The only downside i can see is that when is hot it can be a bit uncomfortable but great anyways!.."
2,watch band too short,The watch is beautiful but the leather band is too short. The band needs to be about an inch longer. I am very disappointed with it.
3,fossil watch,"liked the quality of the watch, however the picture just does not show how WIDE the wristband is. the actual watch is relatively small in comparison, which was the reason for my return. i am a pretty slim woman and although it is a womans watch, it was far too large for my liking, or use."
5,love it,"This was a gift for my boyfriend. It arrived quickly and giftwrapped (which was a nice surprise)! He loves it. The leather strap is a great alternative to metal bands, which are uncomfortable for him. It looks great- but as the picture shows, it's a casual watch."
5,"Awesome, awesome, awesome!","I bought this watch for my 27-year-old graphic designer husband. I love how thick the band is, how it looks rugged/manly but also modern. YAY! Very satisfied with this purchase!"
3,fell apart,"Fell apart within 2 weeks, but thats not really the sellers fault, just a cheaply made product by fossil. The side threading came undone, maybe it was just mine and anyone else's will be just fine."
5,Fossil Watch,"For the price this watch can't be beat! It's a durable, good looking watch. I contacted the seller and their customer service was EXCELLENT! The only thing is the watch (At least mine) has darker leather than it does in the photo but it's still an amazing piece!"
5,FANTASTIC watch!,"My husband wears this watch like every single day. It's very well made, great material. Goes with many things!"
1,DO NOT purchase!,"I repeat, DO NOT buy! The picture displayed looks absolutely nothing like the product you will receive. It is a poorly made knock-off that does not respemble a Pittsburgh Steelers Jersey in any other way, except for colors. I ordered this at the beginning of December, and have been fighting ever since on my refund - to date I still do not have it!Other than the obvious, if I could advise ALL Amazon customers, please read and re-read the return policies, especially on Third-party sellers....i filed an Amazon Claim, and they require a tracking number (for both our protection) when shipping the return. Beware, the cheapest mail that provides a tracking number is $47.70! So not only am I out $146.00 for the Jersey, but I had to call and fight for Amazon to reimburse me, thru a credit to my acct - if you cannot understand the return policy call more than 1 customer service rep!"
2,item not as described,"The Joe Greene jersey was received quickly and seems to be made well. However, the descripiton was that it was made by Reebok, but did not have the Reebok tag or logo on the sleeves. It also was to have the NFL sheield on the neckline which it did not. Disappointing for the amount of money paid."
1,Are yall really fans?,"I have seen some of these reviews, they state they are fans. Well this isn't mean joe greene's jersey. This is L C Greenwood's jersey. Mean Joe Greene's number is 75. So congradulations you true fans, you just bought the wrong jersey, and if it doesn't say reebok then it's fake. Know before you blow (your cash), better luck next time and have a great night:)"
4,the movie is nice but runing time is too long,"I am a musician so i always buy from amazon the composer history DVD,i can`t believe act tchaikovsky that guy also is a famouse russian composer Dimitri Tiomkin,he is a famouse pianist and composer he born in 1894 died in 1979,in the movie they speak in russian but they have english subtitle,and this movie is very good for who like classical music and studying classical music,and the movie is very long and you will getting a bit boring went you watch this movie but it was a true story of tchaikovsky whole life,if you are a musician you must buy it!"
4,Another Beautiful Mind,"There is good news and bad news. The bad news is that this is a film filled to the brim with film cliches portraying Tchaikers as a genius modern artist, struggling with an ungrateful public for recognition. The good news is... Oooh, they do it so well!!! This film really moved me, the portrayal of Tchaikovsky was so absorbing that it really matters to you as you watch it if things go right or wrong for him. I was carried away, and recommend what I expected to be a slightly dodgy soviet biopic which turned out to be a great film. The Soviets could do 'Amadeus' any day of the week!"
3,Interesting,"Interesting, of course the music is great, photography i good, but dramatisation is lousy."
4,Good,"The price was reasonable, much less than the department store. I feel satisfied to date with the product. The delivery time was rapid."
4,Belkin F3H982-25 Pro Series High-Integrity VGA/SVGA Monitor Cable (25 ft.),"Considering the length this cable has worked great. A bit cumbersome for home use, more of a pro situation cable. I absolutely recommend this cable."
3,"Great, inexpensive 25' VGA cord","What's to say? It's 25' long, works well and is a very reasonable price. I ended up sending back and buying the one with an audio cable built in, however."
1,Buyer Beware,"I've had a 3 foot VGA cable that I've been using to clone my old analog TV to my laptop at 800x600 resolution. I recently purchased a 32 inch LED TV (1280x720 resolution). This cable would not interface with the new TV (Blue Screen of Death) and I got an extremely blurry, to put it generously, picture on my old TV. My short cable worked perfectly on both TVs at those resolutions. I would avoid this cable, or the seller Marginmart, at all cost. Cable ""looks good"" but it doesn't work."
5,Monitor cable,The cable works just as expected. The cable was delivered in a reasonable amount of time. I am satisfied with my purchase and I will will buy from this supplier again in the future.
5,VGA cables - great product,"The product is excellent and extremely inexpensive. The UPS service, however, was way below par due to the driver who did not even attempt to deliver and instead sent it back to the seller! But the seller did his job and was very cooperative and re-sent it immediately."
2,Okay,"Simply because of the length of this cord, the quality is diminished as the picture runs through all 25 feet.It is fine for my daughter, but the occasional white line shooting through the screen disturbs me enough to not want to watch it.Although, if you have a real need for a 25 foot cable, I guess there's not much you can do."
1,They sell fake low quality cables pretending they are Belkin.,"when I received the item I immediately suspected something was wrong: I do have already other original identical (same model) and the cable shipped by this vendor was not looking the same (too thin to be a high quality shielded 3 coax cable). When I physically compared the cable it was clear it is not a Belkin original one. Also on the plastic package, the label stating ""Belkin, ...."" was just a sticket, on top of the original one, which declares another producer and model. When I tested the cables the image was very bad quality, nearly unusable, at all resolutions. My conclusion is that the cable delivered are just a fake chinese badly made copy of what they claim to sell. DO NOT BUY THEM! You can also see from the photo that the connectors are not the real Beklin ones."
4,good buy,arrived quick and is great for transferring our computer monitor to the tv...hello instant netflix!
3,"Not bad, but not great either.","The cable works pretty well. The picture is for the most part noise free. And having 25 feet of cable means getting to be anywhere in the room I want while working off of the big screen. The only problem is that from time to time a burst of interference pops up and that can be a bit annoying when you are watching a movie or trying to read something. I'm not sure what is causing it, but I'm betting the cords not as well shielded from outside fields as it says it is."
2,25' vga cable didn't work for me,"This had good reviews, and I have a good concept of Belkin products, not to pricy and good quality. this cable is thin. When I first saw that I figure no problem as long as it performs well. When connected to my 17"" Dell lcd monitor, picture was very poor. I'm sending it back."
4,Buy one with Audio instead,"This is a great product but I should have purchased a cord with RGB & Audio built in, like this one [...]The only thing I use mine for is connecting my netbook to my LCD TV, and I have to use a seperate shorter 1/8"" cable which is a pain and trip hazard.If you just need it for RGB video, this would do the trick."
2,"Fine if you like a ""Pink"" screen.","Just my luck. I did not do my homework and read reviews. Going to Samsung 1080 from Sony Laptop. Just too much lost in signal and cable weight is just not heavy enough for length of cable. Sad, not worth the price of freight to return."
4,good quality,Cables worked great. Exactly as advertised. Much cheaper than local alternative. Using cable to connect my NON-HD computer to my HD TV.
1,"Poor Purchase ... misleading ""high integrity""","I purchased this cable to hook up my Mac Pro with A Samsung 1080P DLP. My fault for not doing my homework and realizing that ""high integrity"" is not high resolution. This cable will only do up to 1280 x 720. It will not do 1900 x 1200 resolutions. Bought an Atlona VGA/SVGA High Resolution Video Cable instead."
1,same quality as my previous $8 25 feet VGA cable,"ghost image, severe interference. work exactly like my previous $8 RiteAV VGA Cable. Even the spec. printed on the cable are exactly the same as those spec. printed on $8 RiteAV VGA Cable. Nothing on the cable suggest that this is Belkin's product. Sticker on the packing plastic bag has another sticker beneath showing startech.com label:http://www.amazon.com/StarTech-com-MXT101MMHQ25-25-Feet-Resolution-Monitor/dp/B000067SPK/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1338918304&sr;=1-1really suspicious!!!"
1,Would not recommend,Lots of blur. This is not a quality product and I would not recommend to a friend or purchase again. Don't waste your money.
3,Vga Cable,The cable is heavy duty and thus thicker than I had anticipated. Not so good to stash in my video cabinet.
4,textured sound,"break out the good headphones with the dedicated amp for this solo effort by ex-dream syndicate guitar player wynn. production is king along with multiple sidemen including peter buck (for you REM completists) and richard greene (its a beautiful day). multi textured guitar rock with dark overtones (no surprise there for anyone familiar with ""days of wine and roses"" by dream syndicate).susan cowsill even sings backup on this work."
4,El General....is back again.,"El General has a unique style when it comes to the genre of music that he creates. Mostly Spanish reggae but has produced songs that have predominantly other tropical rhythms. I am not a fan of his music however, I tend to like songs here and there. Basically, I like a song as I hear it. This album really caught my attention because there were several songs that I thought would be nice to listen to from time to time so I took a chance on the album. It's pretty good. The rhythms vary not all are reggae. If you are familiar with his style then I think you know what to expect. His music usually has one objective: to make you move. I especially like Mecedora and Mariachi Loco. Quite a good album. I just have to get used to it."
2,Not what I thought it'd be.,"I expected this bag to be made of better material than the thin ""plastic"" that it is! I thought it would some kind of canvas material like my other stool/backpack. I'm keeping it mostly for show because it looks nice and matches some other stuff I have but I'm afraid to load anything heavy in it, unfortunately. That almost defeats the purpose of having a backpack but the stool is functional so that's the only reason I'm giving it two stars."
4,Really good complilation,"This is a nice alternative acoustic compilation. Highlights are songs by Grandaddy, Turin Brakes, Paul Weller and Badly Drawn Boy. This is a good way to expand your music collection. Not all songs are good, and some of them are odd (Simon and Garfunkel?) but there are enough gems to make it worth it."
2,Get something else,"I got this product for a really low price. I was so excited. No more wires and tangles.At first everything was okay. It took kind of long for the receiver to search for the mouse and keyboard but it wasnt that much of a problem. The problem with this key board is that it loses signal for no reason. One minute you typing normally, the next its missing entire words and sometimes letters. So my typing ends p loolike ths. ihte itIm always thinking its the battery. So every time this happens, I switch to brand new batteries. 10 minutes later, it goes back to losing signal.I am now typing on my wired keyboard. I threw the wireless keyboard away.I heard Logitech does good wireless keyboards. Might give them a try. But trust me, AVOID microsofts wireless keyboard."
3,Good Return Policy,"The keyboard wasn't very good with range, but this store was very good about taking it back. I'd shop here again."
3,I've used better,"Nice looking set with some nice features. Keyboard works great. Love all the shortcuts. However, the mouse is very jumpy and works mediocre, at best. The range it has is terrible and regardless of how close you are to the wireless unit, it's jumpy."
3,not bad,this is not all that bad. the only problem i have with it is the rang on the wireless. it only picks up when your very close.
3,Mouse wheel is stiff,"Everything is fine except for the mouse wheel. There is too much friction and it doesn't roll freely, to the point that I will likely replace it. Maybe the characteristics are unique to each mouse and one must test the very item they are purchasing beforehand (like knowing not to buy shoes on-line). The mouse is a laser 5000."
3,Great keyboard - rotten mouse!,"The keyboard is really wonderful - I love all the shortcut keys and use them constantly. Its curved shape is very comfortable to use for extended periods. HOWEVER,I found the mouse to be so uncontrolable as to render it useless. I like the silent scroll and the ""back"" button, but went back to my old wireless mouse almost immediately."
4,does what it promises,"i bought this keyboard/mouse over a month ago and it has done pretty well. response time is flawless (from both) and the added features (i.e. zoom function on mouse, hot keys on keyboard, etc) have lived up to expectations. this is a good alternative to buying a bluetooth set ($40 vs $130) for those folks that want a bit of freedom."
2,Microsoft Wireless Laser Desktop 4000,"I bought this set for my husband. We've had no problems with the keyboard, however, the mouse is the worst mouse I've ever used. I don't even know how to describe it. It's sluggish and nearly impossible to use no matter what settings we used. I can find absolutely no redeeming qualities for this mouse other than it did work, just not acceptably. I finally just ordered him a new mouse. I went with the same Logitech Nano that I have and love!"
4,This is a good product.,"I was a little weary of the product because they shipped it without any protective wrap and having had worked in a post office in the past I know that people are not overly careful, but the product works well and I am enjoying it:)"
5,Great product,"Product does exactly what is claims to do. I was able to connect it and getting it working with my Windows XP machine in less than 2 minutes. The range isn't spectacular (6 feet), but this is within the specs. And taking into account the fact that they are available for $14.99 on Amazon, it was a real no-brainer purchase!"
2,Miserable out of the box experience....,"I purchased this item to replace my very old mouse and keyboard. The meager instructions from microsoft say nothing about what to do if the CD they include with the purchase DOES NOT WORK!Also, why is the keyboard the 4000 series and the mouse 5000??You can simply plug the reciever in and get the mouse and keyboard to work without installing the CD but if you want to customize any of the keys or access the help documents, thats another story.After many hours of searching online I have resolved my issues with this product, but I would not recommend it unless you have the time and patience to figure everything out. The keyboard and mouse are comfortable but the aggravation of getting them to work far outweighs any other benefit."
2,Too Big,I ordered this product and returned it. There were other issues which caused me to return the unit and I never actually used it... so take this review with a grain of salt but one of the things which I did not like about it was its size. There really is no need for keyboards to be so big. It takes up real estate on the desk and looks awkward.
1,"this item came in a timely fashion, BUT.....","it was shipped with no batteries whatsoever, and i had to purchase several of them on my own, however, none of them worked. the keyboard, mouse and receiver were all totally dead. i already have an older version of this keyboard, and after installing the new software, the settings on my old keyboard became defunct. trying to find a phone # to call pc master outlet but cannot find one. emailed them to try to make an exchange. product was sold as brand new but it didn't come in a ""product"" box, only a fed ex box, so i'm not sure it's really brand new. am incredibly dissatisfied so far, since my computer isn't usable as it was 3 days ago."
4,Nice Keyboard,"I just got this keyboard mouse combo today. It is a very good set. Extremely easy to set up and the laser works well. My keyboard is below my computer and laser and it still works fine. I was afraid that it would have to be directy in front of the receiver, but it doesn't. IT is going to take some time to get use to the keyboard setup though. It is hard to type on at first due to the layout. Also there are plenty of shortcut buttons both on the keyboard and mouse. Would definitely recommend."
2,"Because of the mouse, I wouldn't get it...","The keyboard works fine, good connection, but the wireless mouse reception has ALWAYS been low or poor, and I have the receiver 6 inches away from it! I'm sure there are better options out there. Good luck. Logitech seems to have better products..."
3,Only Mouse Works; not keyboard,"Only AFTER I got the product, did I realize that the software with it is outdated, and is NOT compatible with Windows 7 or Vista. I was able to download the latest version from Microsoft's website. Beyond that, the mouse connects to the computer via USB, while the Keyboard connects via PS/2. That sucks. I had to go buy a separate adapter for the PS/2 connection.In all, the mouse is connected and functional, but even after buying a separate adapter so that I can plug in my keyboard, it STILL doesn't work. Friggin' Microsoft!"
4,Great once I got it working!,"I was a bit worried when the product arrived... the box was pretty mangled (not from USPS but how it was sent). Upon downloading the CD software on my MacBook, the product wouldn't function. Thankfully, after a bit of internet research, I found new updated drivers online that I was able to download and now it works perfectly! With my MacBook propped up, and keyboard below, my neck is much more comfortable! The only thing I don't like about it is the keyboard is a bit loud when typing. But the comfort bonus outweighs that annoyance!"
4,Not Bad - Very functional,I like all the different functions of this keyboard.......I just wish it wasn't so large in size.
5,Great Keyboard and Mouse,"I'm very happy with this purchase, the Keyboard works great, the Mouse is a little small and if you use it for a very long time like I do, your hand starts hurting. But overall it is a great deal and good choice,I would recommend it"
3,"Decent for the price, but could be better","I bought this for my husband's birthday because it was the only thing he would tell me that he wanted. The main complaint he has about it is that even though it's wireless, you still have to sit with six feet of your computer. He wishes the range were further away. Other than that though, works good."
4,comfort with only 1 issue,"The keyboard is a good ergonomic design. The key functions are great. The only issue is the USB wireless receiver stores in the underside of the mouse, which turns the mouse off (saves battery). Who wants to keep unplugging the wireless receiver on a desktop PC? I don't like that the mouse remains on with no on/off button to manually power it off. What were they thinking?"
3,Not highly recomended,"Overall this is an okay wireless desktop package, but there does seem to be quite a bit of lag between the keyboard and the mouse at times. You can not use the mouse on a pull out tray with the keyboard on it, they will not both sink with the computer in use and the mouse ends up not working at all. For the majority of the time the whole system works fairly well (if the mouse and keyboard are sperated), but when its off... well... It's definately off, and is frustrating."
2,Probably one of Microsoft's worst keyboards,"This keyboard is awfully loud and the keys stick. It's oversized, and the browser zoom tool does not work with Firefox. I paid about $50 for it, and gave up on the keyboard after a couple months (the mouse is fine). Went with the Microsoft Wireless Keyboard 6000 -- a far quieter and better designed keyboard."
2,Very sticky keys,I like the over all design and feel of the keyboard but since I've bought it I have had a problem with many of the keys sticking. It is now to the point where I'll end up with infinitely rrrrrrrrrrrrrrepeated lettersssssssssss at random intervals as I'm trying to type. I'm going to scrap it for another brand sometime sssssssssssssssoon.
2,Very Disappointed,i ordered this item in December. I noticed that when I received it that the mouse actually is the 5000 instead of the 4000. No big deal I thought. I've later realized the the keyboard is the Wireless Comfort Keyboard 4000. I can't imagine that these were meant to be sold together.The mouse doesn't seem to work with some online games.I hate that the keyboard has no lights to show when the Cap Lock and Num Lock are on or off.
2,"Same as Quantaray QSX, maybe OK if 60"" & weak lower leg suffices!","See reviews here on Amazon.com for Quantaray QSX, seems to be same monopod with different label. Weak point is the lower 3 telescoping legs which have no twist lock like upper two legs, especially last section which will collapse with only a few pounds of pressure from above. Also, if you are over 1.8m (6 feet) tall then the 1.5m (60"") total height is too short.Though ball socket pan/tilt head is nice touch on this low end monopod, better to get separate pan/tilt head and get more useful monopod. For instance the Opteka MP100 is 67"" high with each leg having solid snap lock.Agree with other reviewer of QSX, included belt clip is nice, and when used on belt don't need problematic lower 3 telescoping legs.Cheers de Mark"
3,Small & Compact - But it has it's problems,"Small and compact but it has problems with the internal plastic rings breaking which allow the legs to remain secure during use. I took back my first one after a month only to have the same problem occur with the second one. I contacted Sunpak to send me out the parts that broke, it took 3 weeks but at least I receive them. Sunpak customer service was extremely nice, but I've made it a point to keep their number handy as I know I'll have to replace the parts again."
2,Does not hold a position.,I have had trouble with this monopod holding a position once set. I used this with a Canon S3 IS which is light weight. The only stable position seems to be completely collapsed or with just the upper section extended.
4,Nick Cannon Presents: Wild 'N Out - Season One,"If you are into hillarious improtu comedy you will love this show. I was a skeptic at first because it was Nick Cannon but after I saw one episode my mind was soon changed. The guest on the shows are brilliant, especially the Ying Yang Twins and Kanye West. No one is spared. Not even Cannon himself. I suggest this DVD to anyone who enjoys laughing."
5,A great portrait of Jewish immigrant life,I really enjoyed this book. Gold's writing style is very unorthodox but I think this allows you to feel the emotion in his words. This story really makes you appreciate the issues that these poor Jewish immigrants faced and confirms that the American Dream certainly is possible as we have the luxury today in 2007 to evaluate the situations of many of these character's descendants. These people worked hard and helped each other and therefore made better lives for their future generations.
5,very pleased,"The shipping was quick, I got my package two days after I purchased it. Very, very good condition, seems like its new. Very happy with the seller and I would definitely buy from this seller again!"
4,"If you want the ""Other"" side of history, this is the book",The British weren't so bad after all. If you look at the status of the land then; weren't the rebels really the 'traitors?' Some food for thought: On both sides of war there are too much loss.
4,An Annoying Book for Americans,"It is very hard for Americans to swallow an alternative version of a key part of this nation's history. Having been force-fed the polarized view of the political structures of the 18th century, to find an account that points out that the rebellion was ultimately an entirely British affair, fuelled largely by greed and opportunism, is completely foreign to them.This sort of book is very important because it does not pander to the blinkered, flag-waving, Hallmark version of that period of history, but injects a much-needed reality check in case we run away with the idea that the USA was a perfect creation from that point onwards (it was 100 years behind Britain in banning slavery, for example)."
3,Good but uneven and could use more maps,Hibbert does try to explain battles using geographic references but his maps don't back it up. I thought good work on Gen Clinton and the campaigns in the south but less concise on the northern or central campaigns.
4,An Engaging Historical Drama,"History that reads like an adventure novel. Great stuff. Being a Canadian living in the US, and looking forward to citizenship here, I found this book to be a fascinating perspective on the Revolution. Unlike some reviewers, I did NOT come away with a pro British feeling. In fact I was rooting for the rebels, and very much feeling that, if I had lived in that era, I would have been right there with them. So, it seems would some free thinkers in Britain at the time. The personal details about the participants makes the story come alive. Stimulated by this, I will read more about this period from other points of view, as one must do with all history. But, as a way to get into the picture, I think this is hard to beat. I guess my only complaint would be that the supporting maps could have been better laid out, with more details showing where, geographically, things were happening."
4,A different perspective,"The reviews for this book already cover quite a bit as far as subject coverage and style. I will just add that what I really appreciated was Hibbert's integration of fairly substantial primary sources. The lengthy quotations from letters and personal correspondence who fought for the British were excellent. I also enjoyed Hibbert's depictions of Clinton's rather fragile state of mind and his inability to get along with any of his officers, especially Howe and later Cornwallis.The pacing of the chapters was excellent for reading and putting down. There no chapters that seemed to go on forever. It read more like a series of connected essays arranged chronologically. This was a nice break from standard historical writing.Finally, the book overall was great to read and offered a refreshing take on a topic that has an obscene amount of scholarship. Just a quick note that this is written in a British/European style so there are no footnotes or in-text citations."
1,poor remaster,Not remastered from the original tapes! (I have this from the guys that remastered it) It was reissued using several generation old copies. The sound is nothing special. There is an awful edit on the live side between tracks. Buy the repertoire edition. Oh and the bonus tracks? Mono versions of the album tracks..not different just mono.BIG DEAL
4,Thin and lightweight,"This was a great buy for me. It's thin, but quite warm. Great for packing as well if you're on the go. The only downside was it's a bit small for the size-- if you plan to wear fleece or sweatshirt for layering you might want to get a bigger size. Otherwise, this is a great bargain!!"
5,The TOTAL Warren Buffett for the Serious Fan,"This is the biggest and the best of Andrew Kilpatrick's several books about billionaire investor Warren Buffett, not only because it's a well-organized volume of chapters that can be read in order, or individually standing alone.There are hundreds and hundreds of photos of Buffett through his life, his family, his friends, his fans, key Berkshire managers and even historic documents that you won't find anywhere else.This is a book you will be proud to own, and it will be a valuable resource of financial facts and figures and stories about Buffett's life and legacy.Andrew Kilpatrick has written the encyclopedia of Warren Buffett. It also happens to be visually appealing and entertaining."
4,Beyond Comprehensive,"This is an encyclopedic account of Buffett, Berkshire, and the people around both. The author appears to have included every available scrap of information, and broken this archive up into easily digestible chapters. Those looking for a concise introduction to Buffett would probably prefer Lowenstein and Schroeder, but die-hard Buffett fans will appreciate Kilpatrick's obsessive attention to detail."
2,"Not what I expected, but...","I bought an earlier edition of this book thinking it would be a regular biography of Warren Buffett. Instead, it's a strange, very lengthy collection of information about him. The writer rambles and digresses a LOT. But it's not a bad book, for what it is, and you can pick up some investing info amid all the trivia. Just don't expect an ordinary biography."
2,not worthy,They're not very confortable. Not a lot of support for even walking one hour straight in. Probably wouldnt order them again. Wasn't impress with their shipping practice either.
4,Great Shoes,"I like these shoes very much, i have bought over 12 pairs of shoes from amazon, and these rank in my top 3 pairs. Very white, very easy to keep clean. I have wide feet, and these are not tight at all."
2,good shoes BAD EXPEDITED DELIVERY,"those are a good shoes, but the delivery provide service is the worst, i buy the shoes dic 15-06 in expedite service 1-3 days and i recive the shoes 21 4 days more than usually delivery day, i pay 12 more dollars for expedite and theirs give it to me like regular mail, bad deal to me!"
4,Outlaw Years- Natchez Trace,"Most interesting history of the ""development"" of the Natchez Trace. A step back in time to when development included high risk to life and family. Good read for history information."
1,what a piece of junk!!!,"I got a paper with letters on it, they won't come off sticky, they won't come off period..and how is this suppose to work?? no directions... thanks for the terrible reviews above..."
1,Horrible Stickers!,The stickers didn't even come off the paper and if they did they ripped in half and were ruined... a horrible product. I regret paying shipping and handling for this product. DO NOT BUY!
4,it was fun,"I have a few bellydance DVDs at home. I have to admit that this is on of my favorites. Even though I think the warm-up is too long (20 minutes), I have to admit that it is effective. If you don't even have time to do the whole video, the warm-up would be enough for you. There was a 10-minute segment on hip work, which is also pretty good. I think it would have been better if they included more moves than just hip slides, hip locks, and shimmies. There is a demonstration of the routine which is about 5 minutes long (the routine is only about 2 1/2 minutes, but they repeat it automatically), which I love. Afterwards, the routine is broken up into 6 combinations and Sera teaches you how to do them. What I like the most is that the instructor is actually talking instead of using a voice-over."
4,Not for beginners,"I think this video is geared at dancers that have had some background in belly dance. It almost comes off as though Sera assumes that however buys the DVD will have an understanding of belly dance. With that being said this is a great video, it has a nice warm up and isolation section that lasts about 20 minutes. It has a short drill section about 10 minutes but maybe you could knock that out as a practice right before work. There is also a combination section that breaks down all the combos. Over all the DVD is great I think the only thing that is lacking is a longer drilling section along with better stretching at the end of the drill section. However, in other parts of the DVD stretch is done well. But I'd highly recommend this to anyone that has an interest in Tribal Belly Dance."
3,"Love Sera, but the music is very tiring","Sera is very talented, and her presence is fabulous... But I can't exercise to this kind of music. I wouldn't even call it ""music"", mostly some beeping and other synthetic sounds. There are one or two beautiful songs (with Indian tunes), but the rest is just annoying noise, nothing invigorating or relaxing. It's such a pity, because I feel that this program could have been extremely engaging, but the ""music"" kills my motivation very quickly."
4,Good Product,"A little complicated for me but i tried. i wanted this as a fun ""workout"" turned out to be more of way laugh at myself workout and i really never used the video more than twice."
5,I love this DVD,"its wonderful!very challenging, I'm a total beginer, but it gives you the idea of the belly dance motion. it works you up, you start slow then go faster, when I do this I think, ok I cant do all of this now, but I know I'll be able to if I keep at it.its very good I highly recomend it"
2,Strange,The women in this dvd look angry and robotic. I know that tribal dance is different but I ended up donating this dvd and don't miss it.
2,Too Much Fusion,"I understand that the DVD is about Tribal Fusion Bellydance (so I knew not to expect anything authentic or Egyptian etc) but I think there was so much fusion that you really couldn't call it belly dance any more.It was more hip hop than anything else.If it weren't for the title, would someone with no experience of belly dance recognise it as such?I didn't like the performance at the end (for the reasons above) or the music (very bland and monotonous)."
