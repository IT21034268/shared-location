2,A little dissapointed!,"I got speedy delivery on my order, but the book wasn't in as good of shape as described. The spine was broken and several of the pages were loose when the book was delivered and after a few uses, some of the pages are falling out of the book. To my regret, I may have to re-purchase the book from someone else."
4,the problem lies on both sides,"How can we expect people to not look for alternative cures when it is painfully obvious that the AMA is simply a power-broker for itself and its followers? The average person has neither the time nor the resources to check out every theory, but they -do- know who's lied to them in the past, and that would often be their MD. For whatever doubts I have about Dr. Clark and other aternative healers, I blame the allopathic gangsters for driving us into their arms."
1,Look elsewhere for help,"You open the book and start reading. The theory seems odd, but you are interested because unlike many others this book seems to offer some evidence that the treatment works.So you go to the case histories. You find a friendly radiologist to look at the images for you. She looks at many 'before' images: no abnormality on this image--nothing to treat. She looks at many 'after' images: no relationship to the area of the body in the 'before' image--no proof that anything got better.With this kind of evidence I can only conclude that sadly its another scam."
1,The author died in 2009...of cancer.,Her death from cancer is more than enough to cast doubt on her claims. Be wary.
2,Please be cautious when applying this theory.,"I read this book a few times, and I still don't see evidence that the authors premise, that parasites cause Cancer, has been proved. Without that proof then the cure ends up being dangerous when done instead of traditional care, or just expensive when done along with traditional care. As a nurse, in the alternative field, to date, I've not seen one person get better for having read this book, but that doesn't mean that others havn't benifited, I just don't get the premise and havn't seen the cures personally. I certainly hope it can be true, how great for cancer patients if it were. Thanks"
1,Dangerous scam with no scientific articles to support her ridiculous claims.,"On p497, she instructs readers to build their own electric ""Zapper"" using 9 volt batteries.She claims that zapping yourself with this device""kills large and small invaders: flukes, roundworms, mites, bacteria, viruses and fungi. It kills them all at once, in 7 minutes, even at 5 volts... Viruses and bacteria disappear in 3 minutes;"" She does warn that you should not zap yourself with this if you are pregnant. She also fails to mention any scientific literature or clinical studies to backup any of her ridiculous claims. This is only ONE of many dangerous nonsense ""treatments"" in her book. She is obviously trying to make $ off of desperate people; very sickening. I got this book as a gift from a goodwilled but poorly informed person, to pass on to a friend who has breast cancer, so I got to review it before handing to her."
5,"Very, Very, Interesting",Fascinating and full of excellent advice. Highly recommended. I want to learn more from people following this advice and found a public forum at http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/huldaclark
3,Perhaps good for some,"I tend to be very leery of books that promise any sort of ""cure"" or give false hopes. Although I had mixed emotions on this book, I do see how it can perhaps give hope to the most discouraged of cancer patients.I don't think I'd recommend it to any of my cancer patients in general, but I do think that those of us in the medical profession might be able to pick out a few interesting parts and maybe recommend it to those few patients that are realistic but perhaps need a bit of encouragement with their diagonsis.It was a quick read, though I tended to skip sections that bored me."
2,Not surprised when punctured on first use,"I bought it as a birthday present for a 12 year old and we inflated it on the day of the party.about 20 kids had 1 ride each on it and by the time we were done, at least 2 sections were deflated.we did make sure that the area where it was used was free of sharp objects (including twigs or stones) but the thickness of the material is not enough to support the tumbling weight of a child for a long time.it was great fun while it lasted but i would not mind having paid a few more dollars for a ball with thicker gauge plastic."
5,LOVE these dishes,"My husband bought me 4 of these for Christmas, plus the matching 24-oz dish. I love them! They work beautifully with the Corelle Hearthstone dishes he also bought me for Christmas, and they are a good size for our family. I grew up in a family of 7 but now have a family of 4 so I'm always making too much. Now, for portion control, I try to fit dinner in these dishes. They have a great look & great shape, and I love how they help the food I make look special."
3,Not my normal choice,So I normally wouldn't have chosen a movie like this but I was pleasantly surprised by the story and overall performances. I don't think I would seek it out to watch it again but it was worth the streaming fee.
4,Actually Much Better then Expected,This is a wonderful movie certainly not the best that i have ever watched but it was much better then expected and overall entertaining. It is certainly worth watching and Venessa does a very fine acting job in this. I would grade it a A- Worth buying
5,"Heart warming, fact based movie.",Henriette Delille's story is heart warming. Her courage amazing. Vanessa Williams does a great job of capturing the spirit of Henriette. Worth watching for a quick lesson in the life and times of a modern day Saint.A Servant of Slaves: The Life of Henriette Delilleis great for more fictionalized information.The Subversive Power of Love: The Vision of Henriette Delille (The Madeleva Lecture Series)is for fact based adult reading andServant to the Slaves: The Story of Henriette Delille (Weaver Book.)is for Kids.
5,African-American drama,This was a great movie with Vanessa Williams in main role. Ole Louisiana traditions that not everybody agreed on. Make for a good viewing.
4,Not bad at all,"Interesting look into the pre-Civil War placage system of New Orleans - you can actually imagine what it must have been like, trying to break the cycle."
5,A must read for both new teachers and veteran teachers,"This book is by far the best out there for classroom management and how it ties to instructional practice. In clear and practical terms, Rick explains the classroom management strategies and procedures teachers can use to spend a lot more time teaching and a lot less time managing off-task student behaviors. The book is also fun and entertaining to read! I know dozens of teachers who now swear by Rick's approach."
4,helpful for a new teacher,There were some really (surprisingly) effective techniques contained here for keeping a classroom running smoothly so that you can actually teach. It's also a VERY quick and easy read.
4,A great little appliance,I have two of the Hamilton Beach 26290 Waffle Baker/Sandwich Griddles and use one of them very frequently. It is perfect for one or two people but when the kids are here (they love grilled cheese sandwiches) it is not really big enough. I have no trouble making two sandwiches at a time on each unit and the cleanup is a breeze. The concept of two appliances in one is great for it saves storage space.
4,peppermints,"Gave as a gift, excellent service and the recipient was happy as can be with this big bag.."
5,excellent: Vincent is the Bombdiggity,"I think Bobby is the ideal detective. He is superb, alot of my friends do not like his character, they feel he is a know it all and I say he is my boy. Is he still married to Greta? He is wonderful, I am waiting for the next seasons as well."
5,Criminal Intent has done it again.,The second year is just as great as the first year. Keep them coming!
1,Unsatisfactory,I returned it because it had to be used. It was dirty and would not play on either of my DVD players.
1,French subtitle missing....,"Law & Order / What order ? as the First year / the Third year have both French subtitles, the Second year have not...Who could explain this,in english,to a french ?Guillaume, from Hue - Viet Nam"
5,Classic stories for people who love the outdoors,"For anyone who has spent any time in the outdoors or wishes they could, these stories are great. All three books are a collection of Gordon MacQuarrie's short stories that appeared in print in the 1930's through the 1950's, in outdoor magazines, ie Field & Stream. The stories take place in northwestern Wisconsin, and include duck and deer hunting, as well as many fishing stories. Having spent time in this great area, the author paints great pictures of the country, as well as bringing out the true appreciation of the outdoors. These books also show the views of true sportsmen in regards to conservation, and the understanding of our responsibility to nature. And lastly, quite a few chuckles along the way. I can tell you that I have re-read these stories many times through the years, and will again... enjoy."
5,MacQuarrie Takes You There,"This trilogy is probably the best rendition of hunting fishing adventures that I have ever read. These stories contain no grandiose panoramic gushing descriptions of landscape or sunsets, just simple, clarity. A great read."
2,Hypocrite,"If Laurie is such an expert, why can't she maintain a relationship? I'd rather learn from people who can practice what they preach."
5,An interesting thesis,Gary Wills contradicts the view that Adams history of the early American Republic was a critque of American imperialism but rather it showed Jefferson and Madison as being pragmatic expansionist. Jefferson abandoned his decentralizing inclinations during his presidential tenure by imposing a nationwide embargo against Great Britain and by including northern members in his Republican party thereby creating the basis for a national political party. Jefferson's successor Madison further advance the centralization of government by laying the basis for a national credit system and by using regular as opposed to militia forces during the War of 1812. Wills believes that Adams main purpose was to show that the founders were not bracketed in either Hamiltonian or Jefferson camps and were actually very pragmatic men that adjusted to events. I would reccomend this book for anyone who wants a new perspective of Henry Adams and his view of the founding fathers.
4,great shoe for less price...,I use it everyday and it didn't cost me a lot...what a great shoe to buy with less price from the store / mall
4,Save the best for last.,This cd getss better and better as you listen. It ends better than it begins. Production values increase as it progresses also. Great Finish.
3,Good middle book,"This is the second book in the current trilogy about Lanen Kaeler. It is great at being one of those ""middle"" books in trilogies that tend to not be as good as the rest of the series. Though I think it is the weakest of the three, it is still a great read and you shouldn't miss it. The beginning of the book about drove me out of my mind with all the mushy love talk, and I mean mushy. It goes on for quite awhile, but if you can make it past that the book gets much better. I don't think Kerner has quite mastered the art of going back and talking about things that happened in the previous book. She is almost reciting it to you, rather than the characters telling you here and there what you have missed and need to know about the preceding story. If you can get past the first couple chapters of this book, the rest of the book is excellent!"
4,A great read....,"I loved this one as much as the last... It lived up to most of what was promised at the end of the first. There is one problem, with such a good cliff hanger as to what's going to happen next... When is the next book going to come out... Please hurry can't wait to read."
5,seasons of summer,"i really liked this book.for one thing the villain was great, it is impossible to imagine a more slippery, evil evil evil bag of ooze.lanen remains unchanged.she is still a brave hearted girl who can be hard headed and sarcastic(no offense meant).akhor is pretty much the same,exept for being human,he is still valiant, brave, and soulful.rella and jamie are a match made, them falling in love with each other is perfect. another thing that made the book good was KERNERS blend of emotions.Fear, hate, bravery, love, all together in their most intense forms, all together in one book.this book was perfect,better than the princess bride, artemis fowl, and harry potter1."
3,Lacking Something....,"I enjoyed the first book, I really did. And I was excited when this one seemed to carry on the plot. But after reading several chapters, I was just bored. The cute little love scenes REALLY got to me after a while...and the plot just seemed to drag through the middle of the book. It did pick up a little toward the end...and left you hanging. Overall, I like the writing style...all the characters in first person (a little confusing at times, when I forgot who was speaking) but that made it a little more interesting. And I liked the new characters...they helped make the book more bearable. I would say that if you read the first one, you should probably read this one, too. Even when it seems like you're never going to finish it, the end kind of makes it worth while. Still, I'm hoping the third book is more like the first. :X"
5,A GOT TO READ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I watied 2 years for this book and it was worth every min. It is one one those books that you want to read over, over and over agian. There is no dull part of the book and the ending is a killer! This book is a got to read!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,The Lesser Kindred,"This book is good and very realistic, but it has some major faults. First off it makes the reader sit through 50 pages of redundant wedding bliss.It seems that Lanen is too happy and the world too perfect. What i'm trying to say is that it is to good to be true. When the story finally gets going, Kerner spends more time talking about Berys and Marek thans does with Lanen and Varien. That information about the antagonists may become crucail later but it's definetly not crucial now. The Lesser Kindred is one of those books you read once and never revisit."
3,not as good as the first,"I really couldn't get into it. The heroine lost some off the indepentence sharpness and strength she had in the fist book, definatly worth reading if u REALLY liked Song in the silence but not as good i think."
1,Couldn't pick it up,"I didn't even finish this book. It's rare for me to not finish a book once started, no matter how bad. Especially a sequel.However, 65 pages was all I could stomach of this one. Yeah, they love each other. Yeah, they're married now. I figured that out in the first couple of pages. I certainly did not need 65 pages of them gazing adoringly at one another and hopping into bed. And every once in a while, the dragons still on the island would have a section, and I'd think, ""Ok, the real story is going to start now."" No such luck. Soon enough it was back to kissing and gazing and having deep thoughts while doing nothing.The viewpoint still changes constantly, just like the first book, except it seemed worse this time. Very choppy."
3,Okay but not great,"This book does a good job of covering basic material in a reasonably interesting way but it has several flaws. The two biggest flaws are:1) The conversations are extremely silly and annoying.2) Many of the exercises, like sections devoted to memorization are good ideas but the material chosen for the exercises doesn't seem to make any sense. In particular, the sentences chosen to be memorized seem unlikely to ever be used.That said, my girlfriend and I did receive some benefit from working through the course. I would half-heartedly recommend it as a course for someone to work through after they have learned some basics but before they achieve an intermediate level of knowledge. Some much better options for European Portuguese are ""Quickstart Portuguese,"" available on itunes, or ""Take off in Portuguese."" But start with Pimsleur's 10 lessons of European Portuguese before you do anything else."
1,Poorly written and poorly thought out,Though I've studied under Bob Saucy and read this book for his class I confess that it is very poor. It is trite and simplistic in its approach and Anderson thinks everything is demonic and seems to have zero common sense about him. Saucy tries to add some theological substance but it is hackneyed and not well thought out. Don't waste your time with this book when there are countless others that don't hurt so much to read.
3,"Mike is remarkable, you must hear this cd...................","GOOD NEWS, romantic music is alive and doing well, thanks to Mike Campbell. You must hear this cd to believe it. It is one of the better cds I have bought in a long, long time........I must confess that i'm one of those romantic ""die hards"". This is the kind of cd that I have been dreaming about for sometime. I can't believe it is finally here!Let me talk a little bit about Mike and his marvelous voice. Mike has a very relaxing sound. It's more of a one on one experience that he brings with his performances. He really knows how to enhance the feeling of a love song.I think it would be good to put this cd on with the lady that you love and let the mood drive you to ""whatever happens"". You may be suprised!"
4,disney tunes,a must have for the younger generations to learn about the magical kingdom of disney music.
1,Moody Out of His Depth,"If you've enjoyed Raymond Moody's early works and have an appreciation for his scientific approach to NDE's or his look at the healing aspects of mirror gazing, you will not like this book.Although I don't disagree with Moody's desire to take back his own name and his own destiny from the hands of editors who are more interested in selling the ""paranormal"" than providing dignity to Moody's findings, ""The Last Laugh"" makes it apparent that Moody is not philosopher-enough to carry out his intentions to go beyond the current paranormal paradigm. He has no vocabulary for it and fails to create one in this book.Writers change. Their voices take left turns sometimes. I'm not sure where Moody went, but he stepped way out of his depth here."
3,MISLEADING TITLE,Do yourself a favor and read the last chapter first. THEN decide if you want to wade through the rest.
1,Give me my money back!,"This book WAS difficult to read and understand because it was so poorly written, very verbose and it took all I could muster to put up with Raymond's bitterness. Talk about childish name-calling. He really lost my respect."
1,This Book is a Complete Waste of Money,"Dr. Moody devotes page after page to slandering and childish name-calling of his critics which is especially unbecoming to a profession person whom I had always held in esteem. He also trivializes the Near Death Experience, including it in the same category with entertainment, humor and play. The NDE is one which is of deep significance, spiritually and philosophically to many of us and not one to be dismissed lightly as is done in this book."
2,Hard to Read,I wish I knew who the last laugh was on but I think it was me for buying this book. I am not done yet and don't know if I can finish but now I know why I should not use run on sentences!
1,"Not MDF not even 3/4""","The only part of this box that may be MDF is the front mounting baffle. The reast is cheap low grade 5/8"" particle board. It has a thin layer of poly fiberfill but it's not enough for any effect other than to conceal the cheap particle board back and sides. The listed dimentions are also incorrect as well. Not impressed, the marketing is misleading."
4,Worth Reading,"I purchased this album in search of a beat-heavy Indian-influenced new sound. It came across relatively slow on the first track but picked up as the CD progressed. If you are looking to hear solid and heavy drum-and-bass style rave music then look elsewhere, you wont find it here. If you are looking for the fusion of Hendrix style rock, 70's car-chase disco-funk, and the trip-hop trance of State of Bengal then this is the album for you. The 6th and 10th tracks are two of the best, but of course, you can't preview the audio of those tracks here (figures eh?). This CD is a juicy morsel that you could take to any musical feast and be proud to serve. But hey, don't just take my word for it."
4,ahahaha,"track #2 reminds me of transformers, no??i love this CD, and I don't mind the repetitive beats only b/c its more modern than others as badmarsh and shri/ dancing drums."
5,a fun cd to add to your IG collection,"as someone who has to have everything that the indigo girls release (promos, singles, etc), i found this cd a great addition to my collection. i LOVE the interview segments -- it's always fun to hear amy talk about emily and to hear emily talk about amy. :-) and the live versions of the songs are great to have, even if you already have the studio versions. my advice: buy it. although it is ""just"" a single, you won't be disappointed."
2,Libro confuso,"Realmente esperaba bastante mas de un libro creado por Nielsen, lider en category managemente.El libro se pierde a momentos y es bastante confuso. Definitivamente no es un libro para empezar a entender administración de categorias."
3,CRITICAL REVIEW,"BOOK IS PHENOMENONAL AS IT DETAILS A COMPLETE STRATEGY A COMPANY NEEDS TO TAKE FOR ANY PRODUCT AT ANY STAGE OF ITS LIFECYCLE,HOWEVER NEED OF MORE EXAMPLES"
4,My second pair!!,"I adore this shoe! It's sexy, pretty unique in its design and always gets compliments. The only downside is that the patent leather tends to wear away/crack at the pointed end of the shoe! I also wish they came in a wider width as they do pinch ever so slightly but for fashion's sake; I wear them and love them regardless! Fast shipping and handling with no regrets... just make your shoes a little wider Carlos!!! :)"
5,Good book for those who search details about all Iaido Katas,A well written book with good hints for those who are well qualified in Iaido and just need some very details about the Katas. The book covers all levels and all major Katas. Probably due to size limitations the number of pictures are less than enough to follow in detail the actions. The posing helping staff in the pictures are beginners which greatly hinder the understanding of the real meaning of the bunkai (applications).
5,Excellent Book on Iaido!,"I recommend this as a reference for anyone interested in Iaido/Iaijutsu. One word of caution, though: there's many schools of Iaido, so some of the material presented herein will or will not apply to your particular school. However, the background and philosophy material are applicable throughout."
3,Somewhat overrated,"Let me begin by saying that I am not a seasoned iaido practicioner. In fact, I am a complete novice. Therefore, this review is not a ""qualified"" one; rather, it is my personal opionion. The reasons for not giving this book a 5-star rating (like nearly all the other reviewers), are the photos and descriptions of the katas. To me, these aren't very helpful. Everyone will say that it's impossible to learn iaido from a book alone. I agree. But that's no excuse for insufficient descriptions and small-resolution photographs. As a manual, Flashing Steel isn't very impressive. The introduction has some helpful explanations of concepts such as zanshin, but some of the analogies (for example, the comparison between samurai and cowboys) are rather farfetched, in my opinion. Warner & Draeger's Japanese Swordsmanship was much more helpful to me (bear in mind that this only includes descriptions of the Seitei-gata, though)."
5,Just a blast of Healing,Me and my wife are both Reiki Masters (in many Reiki teachings). I have my own practice and also my clients love the music's calming and healing influence.This is one of those music cd series that are a must to have in your collection.. Not only will this have and impact on your healing abilities.... This music just touches you and is so uplifting that when listened to (also when no patients are involved) you will just float in the white healing light. Great for many purposes! This is one of the best manners of relaxations after AND during the day to keep energies in balance.I surely recommend this music to all people .. Reiki Masters or not.BTW Steve Murray has many books and DVDs showing how to become a Reiki Master too here at AMAZON. He is a pioneer and really one of those masters that are true to making this world a better place in an affordable way. His teachings are life changing. So go for it and give it a try!NamasteKonsta
5,Healing Music,"I love both of the ""Reiki Healing Music Attunement"" CD-s.As a Reiki Practitioner I'm using this CD-s to my healing sessions about a week now,and I fill that helps me tremendously.I'm more centered and the time in my sessions disappears,thank to the continuously played music.I do use the CD-s in my own healing practice to.What can I say,LOVE AT!"
3,Was expecting more....,"This cd was okay. Music is nice, but I expected more compared to other reki cd's. I won't buy cd 2"
1,Amateurish,"I feel compelled to write this because I cannot believe so many people find this recording a good investment.First of all, the playing of all involved is amateurish, to say the least. There is no refinement by any of these musicians, especially the composer, who is definitely not a better pianist.The sound leaves much to be desired. It sounds almost as a good home recording, not more. Dryish, no ambiance, and enphasizing the shortcoming of the performers.The music? I found it too much sugar, no meat. The premise looked interesting on paper.Lastly, the CD is a skimpy 38'58"". But that's OK; it reminded me of the two Jewish ladies complaining. The first 'how bad the food was...' the second 'and the portions so small!' I was glad this was over.After reading the reviews, I expected something more profund & spiritual. I should be careful next time.Bruch, take me back..."
2,bad pic quality,You need plenty of light to use this camera to get even ok photos. I can't use this in half of my house because the photos come out to dark. the optinal flash gives everything a yellowish tint and takes forever to load. I use it to take pics of my toddler but by the time the pic is taken he has moved. its not very quick. I also noticed some sellers were selling it for $199. That seems extreme to me the average price is $120. I got it on sale for $80 and even that was to much. you can get a camera for around the same price with more megapixels save your money on this one
4,The best technical history of the Manhattan Project.,"The other review nicely describe this gem, but makes it sound like something only a scientist could understand. I'd just like to add that any intelligent person will have no trouble following this lucid account of the first two years of Los Alamos."
3,"Andy Powell still at the ""top of his game""","When Wishbone Ash basically broke up in 1991, Andy Powell (guitar) continued on with the Wishbone Ash name, but it has been basically Andy Powell solo albums, teaming up with other talented players who come and go. This is perhaps Andy's finest effort ever. The production quality & playing is excellent. The other players are great. The songs are good. There is much here that 1970's Wishbone Ash fans might enjoy. I was tempted to give it 4 stars."
3,Steady as she goes.,"(2002) Wishbone Ash gave us their 20th studio offering ""Bonafide"" in 2002. This album was more blues based. Drummer Ray Weston rejoined the band, Bob Skeat on bass and Finnish Ben Granfelt played guitar as they joined Andy Powell. This release gave us, ""Difference In Time"", ""Almighty Blues"", ""Faith Hope and Love"" and ""Shoulda, Coulda, Woulda"". After 2 years of touring for this album, they released a great album in ""Clan Destiny"", in 2006."
4,A fine blues-rock album,"The one star reviewer laments that this album doesn't sound like early 70's Ash. It's true! But, then - can you name any band that sounds the same after 30 years?! They no longer have the light, melodic touch and harmony vocals that make ""Argus"" so pleasantly wonderful, it's more of a solid-rocking straightforward band here. They also only have one original member (guitarist Andy Pyle) - I think he's the only one on this album on either the previous or following Wishbone Ash albums, actually! But, the songwriting is strong and the bass guitar is up front and well played (even if not Martin Turner). I have almost all Wishbone Ash's 70s recordings and ""Illuminations"" from the 90s, and this is certainly the best I've heard by them since the early 70s - although it lacks the various leanings of their early 70s work (metal, prog, folk-rock), it does manage to succeed in presenting a varied and high-quality rock album."
4,"Good, guitar-based classic rock","Well, this album is great classic, guitar-based rock. It doesn't have the folky and prog elements as much as their early 70's heyday, but succeeds very well as straight-forward blues-based rock. I was a little disappointed with the previous ""Illuminations"" which was supposed to be ""Argus for the 90's"" but just didn't do it for me, but this album has a little more kick and the songs just work better. Not a masterpiece, but a good rock album. Classic fans may be interested to know that at this point the only core member of the band is guitarist Andy Pyle, but he's found other good musicians to fill out the ranks. Too bad this lineup didn't do more, although I've heard positive reviews on the albums that came after."
2,It was okay...,"It is doable, for the price and convenience. But it is very sticky when you first apply it to your fingers, which will cause bubbles or even fragments of things to stick to your fingers so either go to a CVS and get a real topcoat that is from this generation, or spend an extra 10 bucks and get a real one on the internet. The only pro I fond is that it is super shiny and slick when fully dry. But if you can get past everything else like the 10 huge air bubbles and the pieces of hair or dust it picked up, then you are a good person for this product."
5,A swinging good time.........,"Excellent top notch arrangements with a swinging band. Great dance tempos and mix of original and covers. Everyone should check this band out, since they are out and about all over the place. I even picked up there Christmas CD to find some more beautiful arrangements. A six piece ensemble with one HUGE sound."
3,Strange,This book is strange even for its genre. What I did like about it is the descriptions of the kinds of people who end up in this hellish domain. I gave it three stars because it makes you think about your life and how you should improve. Otherwise I would have given it two stars.
4,I don't want to go there,"B.W. Melvin is a man like any other in American society. Living his life, doing what he wants, a regular guy. But one day he finds himself coming up short in Eternity's value system. Put into a place he proclaimed didn't exist, yet he was there. He finds that all he once espoused wasn't really true. Find out what he saw, heard, and why he changed his views when he awoke in the hospital. An interesting book and an interesting person from an ordinary guy."
5,Review,"Great book.it seems sometimes unreal,but I think it is true visitation of hell.Great work done to explain this visitation.thanks much."
1,unbiblical,"This by far is the dumbest book on hell I have ever read. This book wich is written like some weird novel is so unbiblical and dumb I have a hard time finding words to review it. The author talks about periods of rest in these cubes people are trapped inside of in hell. The word of God clearly states there is no rest in hell, day or night. I don't have the space or time to list the unbiblical parts of this book. Basicaly people are inside of ten by ten foot cubes and they live out their lives on earth over and over again with demons appearing to torment them in between short periods of rest. . This is more like a fictional narrative of hell similar to ""Dante's Inferno""."
1,evangelical baloney,"This is the latest example of conservative ""Christian"" fiction designed to :1)MAKE MONEY FOR THE AUTHOR 2) SCARE ""NON BELEIVERS"" INTO BECOMING ""BELEIVERS"". ALONG WITH ""23 MINUTES IN HELL"" AND SEVERAL OTHER ABSURD, NON DOCUMENTED, NON MEDICALLY CATALYZED ""VISIONS"" TO WHICH ONLY THE AUTHOR CAN TESTIFY AS TO THE AUTHENTICITY OF THIS BOOK IS OBVIOUSLY PURE MAKE BELIEVE. ALL BOOKS LIKE THIS DO IS DIMINISH THE CREDIBILITY OF CHRISTIANITY IN GENERAL AND THE SCIENCE ASSOCIATED WITH VERIFICATION OF ACTUAL SPIRITUALLY SIGNIFICANT EXPERIENCES."
1,Tripe anyone?,"This is a terrible book to try to read. The author tries to write dialogues and he's just not very adept at it.I am struggling to make some kind of sense out of his jumbles of words.It's a rather fantastic flight of fancy for him to think that one should believe this is non-fiction. It reads like a very badly written Hollywood version of describing Hell.Save your money and your time and pass this one up.I highly recommend reading ""One Minute After You Die"" by Erwin W. Lutzer instead of this tripe."
1,BEWARE! Many re-recorded versions!,"If you're looking for the original versions of Black's classics like ""Smokie"" or White Silver Sands,"" stay away from this CD! All of the so-called hits presented on this CD are stereo re-recordings of the original mono hits; I suspect most of them were recorded long after Bill Black's death in 1965.The new recordings have the same arrangements as the old ones, and have great sound, but the feeling of the originals is totally gone. Stay away from this CD!"
3,There is no music on this CD!,Lenny is one of my favorites. I bought this CD thinking there would be musical recordings on it. There are none. It is a recorded interview instead.
4,better than expected,"i have to admit ,many audio biographical cd's ive bought have sucked ,the quality is bad ,andnot much time or effort gets put into them , to be honest i didn't expect this to be much different ,but being the die hard lenny fan that i am i bought it ,and thank god! it was good ,the quality was great ,and i actually enjoyed listening to it .i'm a die hard lenny fan ,and i still found out stuff i didn't know about him ...okay sure ,i got so into it ,i was wishing there was a second cd ,but hey ,let's leave that to lenny people, but it's definatly a good product to buy . and if you get this ,make sure you get the albums ,couse there more biographical than any interview or special feature about the guy could be . enjoy"
1,Leaks all over the place,Both the drain cap and the larger top cap leaks oil no matter how well you tighten it. Grid on top fell in when I set the oil filter to drain on it. I bought to save myself time in the clean up. I lost more time than any I could have potentially saved.
1,Complete Junk!,"I've owned two or three of these by now and unfortunately it's about the only type/brand of oil pan sold anywhere near me. Do not buy this piece of junk, the top lid doesn't screw on tight and the front drain cap leaks. Considering that oil is a regulated hazardous waste you would think this company would atleast test their product and make sure it doesn't leak before putting it in stores."
1,Piece of junk,"after first use i had oid spilled all over my garage floor...both seals don't hold tight enough no matter what You do. Please don't buy this product, look at other reviews."
1,Inferior Design and Quality. Very Unsatisfactory.,"The opening is too small for automotive use and neither lid seals. Due to the distance between the typical oil pan drain plug and the oil drain pan, the draining oil can easily spill onto the floor and sides of the oil drain pan. The small size also prevents draining the oil pan and changing the oil filter simultaneously. After use, the large lid and drain plug both leaked. I used this product once, returned the oil to a local auto parts chain, and threw the empty oil drain pan in the trash on the way out!"
1,Don' t waste your money!,"This product leaks so badly that I might as well have taken ten bucks out of my pocket, set it on the floor of my garage and drained my cars oil right on top of it. Oh, wait then I would still have the ten oily bucks.If you buy this product do yourself a favor and throw it in the trash then drain your oil directly onto the floor of you garage, the results will be the same whether you use it or not."
1,good design but poor quality,"i picked this up from walmart - and it was really cheap. $7-$8. after using it on an oil change, i thought it was a good product because of the design. but the larger diameter screw cap as well as the smaller drain cap both leak oil. i screwed them on tightly but the oil still seeps out. i found out the hard way as it leaked all inside my car, even after i double bagged it. that makes this product pretty much useless"
1,Piece of junk!,I bought this at a local Auto Zone. I went to tighten the smaller drain cap and it cracked. I exchanged it for another and that leaks oil despite the cap not breaking on this one. I left it in a garbage bag and it's half full of oil. How can stores and this company market and sell something like this that obviously does not work? Frustrating to say the least!
1,Blitz is the S#%&Z,"What a piece of worthless junk. I tried to use it one time, and oil leaked from both the large and small caps. I finally had to pour the oil into another container and take it to the recycle station. I got so mad that I threw it in the garbage can rather than take it back for a refund. They would have most likely tried to give me another one. This must have been made in some 3rd world country by prison labor. I have never seen anything this worthless in a long time. Blitz should be really proud of their quality control team. Must be a bunch of idiots. I sent an email to Blitz, and guess what, no response at all. Tell all your friends not to buy from them again. They need to go out of business. Screw you BLITZ !!!!!"
1,Absolute Junk,"Leaks like a sieve. Caps cannot be tightened enough without popping back a thread.Company sent new ""upgraded"" small cap that was identical in every way. They promised to send an upgraded large cap, but never did, and I gave up."
1,Don't waste your money,I'll just echo the other reviews on this product. Both caps leak and it leaves a huge mess on your garage floor.
1,Total junk!,"This oil pan is so poorly designed! This should not be sold anywhere. Do not buy, I repeat, do not buy this product."
1,Leaks from both caps,"DO NOT BUY. Don't know how this is still on the market. As other reviewers state, it leaks from both ""caps."" Will make a big mess wherever you put it."
1,Leaky drain pan,I'd give this a zero if allowed. Easily leaks from both twist caps. Any money I saved by changing my oil was spent on degreaser and paper towels cleaning my garage floor.
1,Half My Oil on the Garage Floor,"This product works great for draining your car's crankcase oil. It has a screen to catch the drain plug. HOWEVER, the large diameter plastic lid that seals the unit after draining is a PIECE OF CRAP. You are supposed to tighten it down, then open the small plug to drain the oil into another container for disposal. The large lid has a single thread that if you turn a half-inch too far makes no seal at all. It falls off when you tip the unit to drain, emptying two to three quarts of used oil on to your garage floor. This is a product that needs a bit more engineering to work well."
1,This product is garbage,"I bought this product to prevent oil spills. Conceptually it is sound. Practically, not so much. once it fills with oil, the oil leaks out of the smaller front lid sending oil on to the floor. No matter how you twist the smaller cap it will not make a seal. I am returning this product for a refund. Terrible. In addition, the larger top lid is no better. I bought this from a brick store and compared it to others of the same product, and they all have very poor quality (none of them made proper lid seals). Save yourself a headache and disappointment. Do not buy this product."
1,Leaks oil,"As previous reviewers said, you can not rely on this thing to seal - either @ the top with the large-diameter cap or the side, with the small-diameter cap. Unacceptable."
1,Rubbish,"As the other reviews have noted, this oil pan is rubbish. Unfortunately, I did not read the review prior to purchasing this at Walmart, and everything the other reviewers have noted is true about this product. The drain cap leaked, so I tightened it, and then the plastic cap cracked. There are no rubber o-ring seals for either screw cap. A very poor design by Blitz and should be redisigned by engineers that actually change their own car oil."
1,Leaks all over the floor...,"I bought this and used it exactly one time. After oil leaked from both caps all over my floor, I threw it away and started over. Do not buy this."
1,"Great idea, poor execution","Bought for oil changes and whatnot. Mine actually worked decent most of the time. It did not leak from the side cap like many reviewers said. My problem is that every couple months, while in storage, that side cap would split. Thanks goodness I did not have oil in it. Anyway, I emailed the mfr. (Blitz) from their website. I never heard back in terms of a response but a couple weeks later I got three new caps in the mail. I thought that was nice of them. Unfortunately, it's been a year and all three caps have since split so I threw the thing out. Would not recommend this product."
2,Yep...Messy design.,"I picked one of these up recently for doing oil and ATF changes on vehicles.It looks like it would be a really good design but the top cover and side spout both leak like mad! Due to the warping that occurs with bare plastic to plastic, you can't get a good seal.You'll want to empty it right away after using it.The top grid is handy for catching the oil plugs so they don't go down into the oil... and setting the oil filter on to drain.Hard to empty completely and it still leaks oil after it's emptied.I can't help but think a rubber gasket would have solved most of the issues.Nice Idea but smaller top opening and the messiness kill its usefulness.Back to using cheap pans again!"
1,leaks,Really should've read all these other reviews before I bought this POS. Is it seriously that difficult to make a screw-on cap that doesn't leak? Last Blitz product I'll ever buy.
1,Absolute Garbage,"This drain pan is totally useless. The concept is good, but they have used the cheapest materials available for construction. I would gladly pay double what they're asking if it would work as designed. First of all, the drain cap broke during my first use after it failed to stop a continuous leaking of oil from the side. The top cap also broke during my second usage and I had to resort to using a large garbage bag to transport both the leaking oil (making a major mess in the process) and pan to the recycle place. After dumping the remaining oil, I just threw out this piece of trash and swore to never buy anything from Blitz again. This item is supposed to make your oil change easier, but instead, it made it much more messy than necessary and cumbersome to clean up."
1,Negative stars if I could,"This product suffers from the same thing every other oil change product does - leaks.I purchased this from AutoZone and was skeptical. The rep told me ahead of time that it will eventually leak, just not as bad as the others. The problems are:* The top lid can be easily overtightened causing the top large lid to leak.* The small side cap can be easily cracked just by tightening rendering the pan useless.It took 3 oil changes for me and this is in the trash. Back to the cheapo metal pans.Just to add.. the AutoZone rep was brutally honest and I appreciate that, great store, just a bad product with no good inexpensive ones on the market."
1,"Leaks Oil At Cap, Don't Use to Transport Used Oil","I bought this product hoping to help with oil changes on my truck & SUV. The wide mouth and screen make the distance the oil drops to the drain pan less of a mess from splatter. However the durability and execution of this product is questionable. I am on the second one of these as the cap cracked on the first oil change for the initial pan. The auto parts store exchanged the pan for a new with no questions. The second one has lasted through 3-4 oil changes but the side cap leaks (and top cap for that matter) and I wouldn't use this container to transport the used oil without fear of it leaking in my trunk. Blitz needs to improve their execution of this product before I'll buy another or recommend to a friend. On a separate note, my Wedco drain pan has lasted 15 years with many successfull oil changes."
1,Leaker,"I have pwned this oil pan for 6 years and I can testify that it leaks from both the end cap when horizontal and the top as you pour. They are not major leaks, but the leak around the top is sufficient to make a mess when you pour, and the leak around the small plug is enough to allow residual oil in the pan to ooze out after the pan sits for a while. The opening is also small, such that (at least on my cars) for the first minute or two after the drain plug is removed it cannot catch both the oil stream and the drips from drain port. This leads to a rather large oil pool under my car. I came to Amazon to finally find a new one and had to comment after seeing this here."
4,Great in Savannah,"As a lover of Savannah, I found the stories in this book compelling.I learned new things about the city I adore that make me want to rush back.The book sheds some light on the strangeness on this charming city.A must-read of those who love Savannah."
5,storage,"I use it to store the longer styles of pasta. Spaghetti etc. The container is 11 in. tall and leaves about 3/4 of an in. to spare. I havn't tried to completely fill it but it appears it will hold about 3 lbs. Could also be used for dried beans, rice, cereal or to take on a picnic. Fill it with potato salad and put it in the cooler."
2,"I want to like it more, but...","Larry David is, without a doubt, a brilliant writer; Seinfeld is my favorite sitcom--perhaps my favorite TV show--of all time. But for me, he's such an unappealing performer, that I really can't fully enjoy this show. Yes, some of it is certainly funny, but I've never had any laugh out loud moments--as I often had with Seinfeld.The other, related, problem I have with this show, is that it's all about Larry David. Even if I did like him as a performer, I think having one character in a sitcom where pretty much all of the action revolves around him is very limiting. I admit, my dislike of David exacerbates this a lot, but (to bring up the Seinfeld comparison once again) I would have problems with a show only about George Constanza or Cosmo Kramer.I do know people who love this show, but I think the fact that it hasn't reached the popularity of The Sopranos or Sex and the City, says that I'm not alone in my feelings about Larry David."
3,It's an acquired taste. DVD packaging sucks.,"The show is an acquired taste. I personally got tired very quickly of the predicaments Larry David gets himself into. I also find the portrayal of women in this series to be particularly disturbing, especially when my boyfriend says that it does embody how guys see their wives. (If so, eew.) Still, some of the episodes are amusing in the same way that you can tear your eyes away from a car wreck.My biggest complaint with this DVD set though is the packaging. It's very difficult to get to the 2nd DVD without breaking the box. Would it have killed them to use a more standard packaging format? Also, the photos of the DVD inside the case are cute, but it makes it harder than normal to tell (especially with that nasty 2nd DVD) if the DVD is in the case or not. Generally, it just seems like an ill-conceived design. If it were in an episode, I'm sure Larry would have issues with it."
2,Deja Vu,"Product arrived in fine shape. However, after screening a little more than one of the three VHS tapes, I noticed a disappointing similarity in some plots/scenarios to the Third Season offering (which I had purchased much earlier). Perhaps Larry's inspirational well was going dry by then?? Latecomer as I am, I enjoyed the Third Season much more than the First Season as a result."
2,unpleasant viewing,"The Seinfeld show specialized in getting its characters into situations that were funny and uncomfortable, but chiefly funny. ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" similarly delights in getting its characters into situations that are funny and uncomfortable, but chiefly uncomfortable."
1,"Disappointing, unsophisticated, not funny - PASS",So he co-produced Seinfeld. So what. Reading others' reviews I had to go through the pain of watching three episodes but - no escape - this is insultingly stupid. It's just bad. As sophisticated and as funny as a three year old discovering four-letter words. Combined with bad acting. I very rarely write reviews but this made me do it. Just get something else.
1,American 'humor' at it's worst,"Self-deprecating, mind-numbingly boring drivel. This has to be the most boring show I have ever seen. Larry David should stick to his day job... anything but this."
1,"annoying, awful, ick!","this show is possibly the least funny thing i have ever seen. larry david is an annoying man! he whines and complains and clearly thinks he is hilarious, which he is not. the other actors are no better, and the premise is ridiculous! i don't know why anyone would buy this. on the other hand, the dvds would make great coasters."
1,Not do much,"I'm amazed that Curb became such a hit. Later seasons are great - funny, witty, fast paced and well written. The first is really BAD."
4,Brilliant show!,"If you liked ""Seinfield"", or even if you have not seen Seinfeld and enjoy dry humor, you will love this show. Larry David, the co-creator of Seinfeld plays himself, but there is also a fictional depiction to his character. His wife on the show, is not really his wife in real life, etc...and many of the people from Seinfeld and other famous actors make appearances to support his craziness.Larry's character can't help but offending almost everyone that he comes across during his day to day life. The situations he goes through are ironic, and hilarious...and you just can't wait to watch the next episode. I highly recommend!"
3,Not as good as season two,"I saw season 2 before the first, and I felt the second one was much funnier than the first. Though there were good moments in season one (like Larry's eulogy) there werent a lot of rolling on the floor laughing. It seems that CYE gets better as it goes on."
5,Hilarious!! Larry David Rules!!,I m so thankful this Show is out on DvD. I never once watched it on HBO and boy did I miss a lot..This show is one of the funniest shows on TV today..It ranks right up there in my opinion with the best of all time comedy shows..Right next to Seinfield!!
4,Me Stinks it very phunny!!!!,"I'm in favor of dis here tv show. It tickle my phunny bone til I kan't stand it anymore, more. Larry David gets all worked up into a big fuss in every episode. What a fuss-budget! And the udder kast members are so phunny I want to run to the bathroom and let it all out! I remember the one where his wife's friend thought he liked her when the they went to the movies together and then the friend told the wife and she was so mad at Larry. And there are lots of phun cameos in diff'rent episodes, like Elaine from Seinfeld is in one (fouler mouthed). And Larry's friend is named Richard Lewis who is a phunny comediean."
2,"Seller great, used DVD not so great","I bought this DVD used. The seller shipped the item quickly, but when I received the DVD there was a sticker on it stating the previously purchased price was $.99. I paid $10 more for a used dvd that has skipped every time I have tried playing it."
4,A Seinfeld meets HBO?,"Well, CYE is absolutely hilarious...It's sorta like a Seinfeld meets HBO sort of show. The star actor, is Larry David, who is the actual co-creator of Seinfeld, and the episodes go through Larry David's normal every day life. But, his normal life revolves around all sorts of crazy bumps and twists along the way. Sorta like many Seinfeld episodes, Larry David goes through his days and has the most ridiculous, crazy meetings with people all the time.I gave this 4 stars, because this first season of CYE didnt have the connecting plot through the whole season as the other 3 seasons do. The first season seems like a lot of random episodes, whereas the other seasons have a basic background plot through each.Overall, this is a great HBO show, which should be checked out by any Seinfeld/comedy fan."
4,good days and bad days,"Have all three seasons, have watched about half the episodes in about two days. That's a lot of L.D., even Cheryl might not be able to take that much at one time. She is a gem, just right, very patient, but not a push-over. Much better wife character than say the one on Everybody Loves Raymond. Cheryl does not hate Larry. She is just delightful, a dream. Some episodes are much better than others, but I have not figured out why yet. They just are. I ff thru the very predictable bits, which are just too tedious. I have now seen every Seinfeld episode about 20 times, so it's nice to have some fresh material. It's a great series, like the way Larry looks, walks, carries himself, his observations."
5,Great product,I ordered this product as a Christmas gift for my parents. They love the show and so thankful I found it online for a really great price! It came I believe before the estimated delivery date which was a plus. Thank you!
3,It's all that was advertised...and that's it.,"Sure, the episodes were good. And when I first opened that box and figured out how it worked, I was pretty fascinated by its design. But this DVD doesn't really have anything out of the ordinary. Basically, it was put out for fans who loved the show. Larry David and co. thought they could make a few more bucks on the franchise, so the DVD was slapped together and a couple more million dollars were deposited in the bank. You've got all the episodes of Season One, an interview, and the inaugural special that started it all...and that's everything. So if you love CYE like me, buy it--but don't expect to be blown away."
4,"Funny, but not yet at it's peak","The first season of Larry David's ""Curb your Enthusiasm"" is some of the funniest TV you will ever see. There have already been so many other reviews touting why this show is so great so I'll skip all that and just say that the first season is not the best. In fact I'd say it's least of Curb's four seasons. The best season so far has been the second, but they are all hysterical. If Curb continues this streak for say a few more years it could become the Black Adder or Fawlty Towers of American TV."
2,im a fan... but wow...,"ive been a fan of curb your enthusiasm for about the last 2 seasons of the show. from what i saw it was laugh out loud hilarious. so, naturally, when this came out i had to have it. i went out and shelled out [$$] for it. the ride home i was playing with the case, which is the BEST DVD CASE EVER, and earns this review one star.so i get home and pop disc one into my dvd player, but not before i went to the bathroom. i thought that if i had a full bladder i might piss myself. this. however, was not the case. i was extremely let down by the quality of the episodes, they just werent that funny. i just wasnt laughing.my suggestion: wait for season 3 and 4 to come out, then buy those... but leave this one alone unless youre buying it for the case, for which i couldn't blame you."
3,Just ok,"I got this DVD when it came out right away because I loved Seinfeld so much I thought I'd like this too. There are funny moments, but inbetween those moments it is slow and boring. Larry is not that funny...he is almost annoying, and not in the George C. kind of way. I would not buy this unless you had nothing else to watch."
1,Funny NO - - Stupid YES,Who can actually think this show is funny?It's stupid. This guy is just a moron.He has no talent.He just can't shut his stupid face.
4,Only one flaw,"Fantastic series...only one flaw though. When I orginally watched the series on HBO it was in widescreen; just like all of HBO's other series (Sopranos, Oz, Band of Brothers, etc.). For some reason they opted to not include the widescreen format on the discs. Even though it is a very well written series."
2,Season one,Season one is simply not his best season. I'd recommend another one if buying this for the first time.
3,Beauty is in the eye pf the beholder.,I didn't think this was very funny. I don't like people who easily tell lies. Perhaps this was too Hollywoodish for this middle american.
1,"Brilliant show, horrible video","I have to say, I have many tv shows and movies from Amazon instant video and I have never been unhappy with the quality. This does not look like it did on tv, and I never had a high def tv. This looks like it was taken with a cheap hand held camera."
2,Disappointing,"I recently started watching the eighth year of this series, so I ordered the first year. I fail to see how it got renewed."
4,Hillarious beyond belief!,"Don't plan on viewing this, unless you are prepared to laugh frequently! The comedy of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" is unlike anything Hollywood has to offer today. Think of it as Seinfeld without sensors. Tackling topics you wouldn't dare speak of in a social setting, Larry David stumbles into the most bizarre and uncomfortable of social situations with insanely funny results. While this series was just finding its place (just wait until the next two seasons) in season one, it is still brilliant, edgy, and innovative. If you're offended easily, you may look elsewhere, but I'm a Larry David fan for life."
5,You're luck to have this! Where's Region 2?,"I sometimes think that the creative and talented people behind some of the greatest artistic achievements of our times hae no idea that there is a world outside the USA. Or is it the businessmen behind those talents?I live in the UK - we're not as big as the USA, but there are 60 million people here, and we're all into DVDs and quality every bit as much as people are in America.I have money burning a hole in my pocket, desperate to be spent on a REGION 2 DVD of Curb Your Enthusiasm. BUT SUCH A THING DOES NOT EXIST!!!!!!!!!!!!!While I'm on the subject, this isn't the only show or movie that is available in the States but not in Europe. But I won't bore you lot with a list. Let's keep things specific: This is a great, great TV show, perhaps bettered only by its own second series. You're lucky it's available, so why not buy it!Cheers!"
4,As ususal...,"As ususal Gloria Estefan pulls through with another excellent cd-single of some great dance remixes of ""No Me Dejes De Querer"" and ""Como Me Duele Perderte."" The cd contains 9 songs and 64 minutes of non-stop dance tunes. This is must have for the tropical version of ""Como Me Duele Perderte."" Any huge Gloria fan should buy this for their collection especially if you love her Spanish albums!"
3,Background music,"Beware, what you hear in the samples is pretty much the whole album. It tends to repeat the same notes over and over again for nearly 30 minutes. I wouldn't want to just sit and listen to it, but it's not bad when I'm doing something on the computer and I want music that isn't distracting yet isn't too somber."
4,Music of the Golden Age,"I've found Mr. Iger's book to be wonderfully useful and enjoyable as a reference companion. I've read a number of biographies of musicians recently and have been glad to be able to refer to this book to check on the musicians named in those works. Iger's book also yields a great deal of pleasure in helping resolve questions that come up in conversation with friends: Who was it who wrote ""On the Sunny Side of the Street?"" Oh yeah, Dorothy Fields. And look at all the other hits she wrote! After looking at my copy of the book (to look up someone she'd heard about on NPR), a friend of mine has decided she has to have her own copy. A good idea, since I'm reluctant to let my copy out of the house."
3,Splendor In The Grass,"Single Gun Theory may have come out of Australia, but their sound has some basis in Indian/Pakistani Bhangra music, which was gaining some UK exposure about the time this wonderful CD was released.This is the direction sampling should have gone: as added color to already formed songs, rather than the flat-out plagerism heard too often today.""From A Million Miles,"" ""Words Written Backwords,"" and ""Angels Over Teheren"" are all top-flight dance hall tunes, great examples of the convergance of techno and world-music that, while never too popular in the States, controlled international music for two decades."
2,Yet another compilation,"Once again Chicago has managed to give us yet another compilation of old hits only this time in live format and 3 studio songs... The live tunes are done rather well but to give a live concert coverage their needs to be more substance and Chicago has not delivered. Chicago needed a 2 cd set for this to work. As for the 3 studio tracks; well, they didn't do much for me."
2,Time to move on.,"I have been a Chicago fan from 1970. I enjoyed most of their albums & I've seen them live a few times. Unfortunately, they don't sound that good live. And to hear Jason Scheff & Bill Champlain sing for Cetera/Kath, makes it even a bigger mistake. Sorry, the only good songs on this album are the studio cuts & the Higher & Higher song is no bargain."
4,Interesting Live Music,"There's definitely potential here for Chicago to continue their legendary music, and from a few of these songs, they've certainly shown it well. Except for the last song with Michael McDonald, there were a lot of memories given to me( I was especially rocked by ""25 or 6 to 4""), and the new songs were alright. All and All, I believe Chicago is going towards the right direction, but please, give us new music! Keep on rockin'!"
3,Ok,"This is a good cd, that sounds very good and has the band playiong some of the best hits. But thern again, it has a lot of songs that are missing. Where is Saturday in the Park, Dialogue, the good old stuff. However I really like the ballad. I went to their concert a few moths ago, and this would be an awesome cd if they had most of the songs from the concert. This gets 3 stars for good sogns and good quality, but bnot enough good songs."
3,NOT CARNEGIE HALL,"Yea it is mixed better than the original live albums but it lacks (as does thr current Chicago in person) the spontaneity and spirit that one feels with older Carnegie Hall album. I must confess, however, after seeing Chicago live in the 80's with electronic drums, too much bass, etc. it was nice to hear them do the older tunes with a proper mix so one can hear the horns."
1,Tired. Just plain tired.,"The title says it all. If you have been to any of their concerts in the past 6-8 years, you have heard these songs 6-8 times. It is time to change the set list. What I fear is Live, Vol. 2 + 2 new limp songs.And what is with ""Higher and Higher?"" Is this an outtake from a McDonald CD? Chicago is the band with the name on the CD cover and yet they only sing back up. Whose bad decision was that?""If I Should Ever Lose You"" is a good song albeit written by Burt Bacharach. This band has talented writers and musicians. I hope that someday they will stop writing songs they *think/hope* will be a hit and write what they feel from inside. If the public does not want to hear a Chicago song and reject it, better to have written what you want than to pass off another bland song like ""Back to You"" to the listeners.These guys are not hungry any more and I think they are scared. And it is a shame. These guys are some of the most talented musicians ever to record rock and roll."
4,Chicago does a pretty good live album,"I had my apprehensions before buying this album. When I saw Chicago live in 1996, they were so bad that I walked out during the concert. Some songs (Feelin' Stronger Every day"", ""Call On Me"", and ""Searchin' So Long"".) are better than the studio versions. Too many songs are drawn from certain albums, (i.e. II, and VII. Was the whole ballet really necessary? It's already on II and IV!) Lamm is good on ""Beginnings"", but that is the only song where he is used extensively. ""Just You'N'Me"" is pretty good, but Walt Parazaider takes too many liberties with his overbearing flute solo. Jason does a good job with the vocals, and I wish people would stop comparing him to Cetera. Tris Imboden does a respectable drumming job, doesn't attempt Dan Seraphine's cheesy percussion solo on ""Beginnings."" The new songs are nothing to sneeze at, even when compared to the Heart of Chicago's new songs."
4,Glad I Bought It Early!,"I bought this right after I attended the concert at the Taste of Chicago 1999. I agreed with most of the selections made for the album (I might have even dropped one of the studio tracks for another live track). In my opinion, the best tracks are Mongonucleosis (a jam mixed with a little salsa -- it knocked the crowd out), Beginnings (it may never have sounded better), the Ballet, and 25 or 6 to 4 (Keith just knocked the crowd out with a killer guitar, with a horn riff going on behind him near the end of his solo). The studio tracks were OK, though I might have dropped either of the last 2 for another live track (I'm a Man flat out rocked in Chicago -- I would have included that). Since the tour with EWF appears to have helped sweep this one off the racks, I sure am glad I bought this early!"
2,"This One Didn't ""Make Me Smile""","Oh yes Chicago # 26. Have there really been that many? Although the song list is great, the music isn't. Actually, it's not the music, it's the vocals that drag this recording down. Somehow, whenever Jason Scheff sings a Cetera song, I think I'm at the Holiday Inn lounge. And, let's face it, Bill Champlin does not do any justice at all to the songs that the late Terry Kath once sang. The CD is well recorded, and the music itself is almost exactly how one remembers it. Maybe a live instrumental CD of old Chicago favorites would have been better. Even as old as it is, Chicago at Carnegie Hall is the live recording that will ""Make You Smile""."
5,Chicago XXVI: Live in Concert,This is a concert CD that lives up to the live Chicago experience. The horn sound is a vast improvement over the Carnegie Hall set of the 1970's. It is a lively and completely enjoyable CD. My one negative comment was the use of Michael MacDonald on the last tune. Bill Champlin could have easily filled his vocal.
4,Chicago style 2000,"When I first listened to the new live album by Chicago I liked it.Starting out with ""Make me smile,"" Bill Champlin is excellent.This version is just about as good as the original.The rest of ""The Ballet""suite is tight to the end.""Mongonucleosis,""comes acrossed as ""raise your glass of tequilla and party!""Then there is always the ballets that will woe the ladies.""Beginnings,""features a booming Robert Lamm vocal.On ""25 or 6 to 4"" it's Jason Scheff's vocals and Keith Howland's guitar solo that standout.Two bonus tracks are thrown in you can't go wrong!"
3,"Good Live Recording, New Stuff just so-so","I've been a Chicago fan since 1974, and I consider myself to be an honest fan. I really like most of their music, but some of it falls short. Which pretty much sums up #26. The live stuff sounds great, probably because they've been playing pretty much the same setlist for the past 8 or 10 years. By now the newer members have the old stuff down pat. However, the new songs are disappointing. It's not that they're *bad*, it's just that they don't quite cut it. Which is too bad - the band had showed some recent potential at reviving their past musical creativity with ""Night and Day"" in 1995, and the Christmas cd in 1998. Hopefully #27 (next year?) will show a continuance of the recent creativity displayed in the aforementioned records. If you're a fan, buy 26 for the live stuff - you'll like it . . . honest."
5,Solid Country Music,"This is a 2005 Hux Records release of two of Stoney Edwards great albums, on One CD. Stoney has a voice and the musical integrity that harkens back to the sound of Lefty Frizzel. The sound provided on this re-release is excellent, comparable to the modern studio recordings. A fine small booklet and liner notes make this CD collection a real bargain. There are 20 songs here, including his most famous: ""Two Dollar Toy"". There are also some lesser known numbers that are stunning, including: ""You Stayed Long Enough"", ""Honky Tonk Heaven"", and perhaps the finest of the album, ""I Dont Believe I'll Fall in Love Today"" (the origianl version of Ray Price's more famous, ""I Wish that I Could Fall in Love Today""). Get this CD while it's still available.....Stoney was the real thing."
5,Absolutely Fabulous!!,This was wonderfully written! I held my breath until the end - it was so very interesting to see the hero of this book go to the lengths that he did to get his son back. And to have the friendships that he had - it really was good to see men care so much about each other! Great action - and who knew you could throw a plausible love plot into the middle of all of that. I would (and have) recommend this book to anyone looking for an intelligently written action packed novel.
5,"A mystery, a thriller a love story",Once a Ranger is the perfect book for a flight. It is fast paced and has all the elements of a super spy story. The author has also written into the undercurrent of the book a beautiful love story of a man for his son and his new girlfriend. Read this book and you'll read everything Stan Johnson writes.
2,You may want to read Appleworks for Dummies instead.,"I bought this book to learn how to use Appleworks. I found the information sort of vague. Although I have not read the Appleworks for Dummies book I have read Windows 98 for Dummies, Macs for Dummies, and iMac for Dummies. I found the Dummies books to be full of useful information, easy to read, and entertaining."
3,Not a 10,"I started to read everyone's reviews while still in progress of reading ""Three Wishes"". I stopped because I didn't want to read what happend. However, every review I read gave the book a 10. At that point I certainly didn't rate it a 10. I have finished the book now. I am rating it a 5 which is being a bit generous. Someone else rating the book a 1; I wouldn't go that far. That person stated the book was boring. I would agree with that. The best part of the book was her death. I am not saying that to be ""funny"". Her death made the scene of the bright light and wishes more real."
3,editing,"I read this in a paperback several years ago so I wasn't surprised by the ending. I love this story. I like the characters and the plot. However, I just read it as an e-book and I was so disappointed that I paid almost $8.00 for so many typos. At least one on every page and some pages there were more than 4. It really detracted from the story. I understand once in awhile but my goodness this e-book was just full of them th was used in the place of m almost consistantly. Other words were whole spelled hole. This was the first e-book that I have seen so many errors in. I would imagine that Ms Delinsky would not like seeing her work trashed this way."
2,"Good story, bad editing","The story was intriguing, following an expected outcome. A sad ending that you could see coming early on. The editing of this book is deplorable. Ever heard of spell-check? I've never read a book with more misspelled words, misuse of words, duplications of words. Nearly every page had some error. It detracted from the story immensely."
3,Misspelled words,Enjoyed the book. Didn't really like the ending. I could not believe all the words that were misspelled. Did anyone else experience the same ? ?
5,One of my favorite Delinsky books,"This is one of my favorite Delinsky books. Be prepared to have a box of tissues by your side though. Beautiful story, sad yet beautiful ending. I have read every Delinsky book written. I'm just about to enjoy her latest ""Escape"". When I see the Barbara Delinsky's name, I buy the book right away no matter the reviews. She is that good."
2,Kindle copy full of typos and punctuation errors,"Although the plot and characters were carefully crafted, Simon and Schuster did a lousy job of editing, I have never read a published work that had so many punctuation and spelling errors. As an author myself I would be horrified to have anyone purchase an e-book of mine with with this many errors."
3,I Felt Cheated,"Although I've enjoyed all the Barbara Delinsky novels I have read, I truly felt cheated on this one. The story was absorbing and sweet, up until the last few chapters, at which point I was thrown through a loop, given a tragic ending that I really was not expecting. The ending was so devestating that I was angry enough where I had trouble getting through the last pages. I felt angry and cheated after reading a story that begins with hope and optimism that ends quite the opposite. So, if, like me, you read for escapism and happy endings, I would not recommend you read this book. The ending destroyed everything about the story that I loved prior to the ending."
2,Could have been good story but it stumbles at the end...,"This is a story of a small town in Vermont with the usual spectrum of interesting characters. Bree is a small-town girl waiting for something out-of-the-ordinary to happen. Tom Gates is a guy from the big city who is about to be offered the opportunity to atone for past sins. Ms. Delinsky does a good job of showing us what small-town Vermont can be like. The ending, however, I found disappointing and trite and distasteful. The author doesn't seem to have much affection for these characters. I'd stick with some of her earlier works, like Fingerprints and Moment to Moment."
1,Boring; a big disappointment,"I looked forward eagerly to reading Delinsky'slatest book. She hooked me on ""Fingerprints""and some of her earlier works. This books waslackluster and dull. The characters lack depthand the story is, well boring. Barbara, go backto some of your earlier books and give us somemore like Heart of the Night. Take a lesson fromDiane Chamberlain, an excellent author, who writesin the same genre, but holds the reader's attention."
2,Frustrating,"I've read most of Delinsky's books and loved them all. This one was a disappointing surprise. I didn't even finish it till the last page. If you like Barbara's books to escape from reality for a while, run away from this book. It will only remind you that life sometimes is just a bad joke."
2,Expect a miracle,"The subtitle for Three Wishes is ""expect a miracle..."" If youread it, you can expect misery. Sure, the characters arebelievable and the local color charming. But, like SusieMorris, I fail to see the wondrous lesson we should learn whenBree becomes one with the light, leaving a grieving husband anda motherless child. Furthermore, even though the author dropshints about the ending, they're ambiguous enough to the readerso that we can be in denial until the last chapter. Unless you're a masochist, don't buy it and don't read it."
4,Great story; beware the ending.,"I was undecided as to whether or not I should read this book, not being sure if I was prepared for anything but a ""happy ending."" But the author is a favorite so I took a chance. Am I sorry? Well, yes and no. The plot and characters were excellent and I quickly became absorbed in their lives. And, like Tom and Bree, I began to believe that everything would work out just fine. So, I was rather blindsided by the ending. (Cried for 2 hours.) I would be interested to know if this story was prompted by some special experience in Ms. Delinsky's life. No matter what, the book did make me think and reflect and ponder, which is a fine thing for an author to cause."
1,"I like most of her books, but I hated this one","I bought this book when it came out in hardcover on the strength of the rest of Delinksy's books, which I would describe as featuring well-defined characters and being more complex and better written than the average romance. This book isn't a romance, though, unless you like your romances to have desperately sad endings. But the sad ending wasn't my biggest complaint. My big complaint was that to get anything out of the ending other than outrage that the author wrote it, you have to place so much importance on having ""natural"" children that you don't believe that two people who love each other could have a wonderful life together without them. I have ""natural"" children now but there was a time when I wondered if I ever would, and I found the underlying attitude of this book offensive."
3,GOOD CONTENT--OVERBOARD DESCRIPTION,"I WAS VERY, VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT A GOOD STORY HAD TO BE TAINTED WITH UNESSCESSARY SEXUAL DESCRIPTIONS--I AM DEFINITELY NOT AND OLD PRUDE, BUT DO FIND SUCH PASSAGES RUINOUS OF THE OVERALL BOOK--AFTER ALL, WHY, O WHY DO SUCH THINGS HAVE TO BE INCLUDED?? THE PLOT COULD DO VERY NICELY WITHOUT THEM. THE SEXUAL DESCRIPTIONS ADD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AND IN NO WAY AFFECT THE FUTHERANCE OF THE STORY LINE. I, FOR ONE, GET VERY WEARY OF ENCOUNTERING SUCH PASSAGES. I THEREFORE, HAD TO RATE THE BOOK ONLY A THREE. OTHERWISE, IT IS A GOOD STORY, TOLD IN A GENTLE WAY...........IF THE AUTHOR WOULD JUST REALIZE THAT SOME THINGS ARE BETTER LEFT TO THE IMAGINATION!"
4,Why O Why?,"Such a good book.....I read the Reader's Digest condensed version and as I was reading, I wanted to run out and buy the book so I could enjoy all of it. BUT....I can't believe Barbara ended the book as she did. Why O Why didn't she give it a happy ending? I cried so much I could hardly finish. I had to take one star away because of the ending. But if anyone enjoys second chances and tear-jerkers, this is the book for them. Wonderfully written. I am sure I will read more of Barbara Delinsky......I might check the ending first though ;)"
5,Barbara Delinsky didn't let me down with Three Wishes.,"An avid Barbara Delinsky fan, I couldn't put this book down. It grabbed me from the start through to the ending. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this book to romantic book lovers everywhere."
3,Enjoyable story with a not so enjoyable ending,"This book is a quick read. I had Julia figured out long before the ending. I did not expect it to end the way it did and it ""put a damper"" on my overall enjoyment of this book. I like the way Ms. Delinsky writes, and I am looking forward to reading some more of her works.)"
1,Wrenchingly sad ending ruins otherwise beautiful story,"Why make readers care about a character, why talk about light and love and transformations, then brutally yank that character away from us? This was a most unusual story of redemption, about a man who comes to care greatly for a woman he injures in a freak accident and the woman who lets down her guard to love him in return. What should have been the greatest gift becomes, instead, a death sentence. Benevolent being? Where was Delinsky's editor in all of this, to turn her away from such an appalling twist? You know how they shoot multiple endings of movies and then test them with audiences? Wish they could have done that here. Bad choice. Left a bad taste in my mouth - and I really love Barbara Delinsky's other work. I would have given this five stars until the end, and am writing this review to warn others. The ending was a real downer."
1,WARNING - All or nothing Creative Suite Package Upgrades,"Heads up, if you bought Adobe Creative Suite 1 Package and then buy an upgrade like this one planning to upgrade just part of it, you're in for a rude awakening.In others words, ""Adobe don't play that."" What you buy in a suite collected package, can only be upgraded the same way, which makes little sense, but hey they're the ones who wrote the code.It's all or nothing, when it comes to collected-package product upgrades.On a side note - the one star is based on this policy, which limits the usefulness of this upgrade product, not the product quality which is probably up to Adobe's normally outstanding standard of excellence.I'm sure it probably works great, which makes this policy even more frustrating and irritating."
1,bad amazon,They sent me the wrong product and did not rectifythe problemlast time I buy from this place
3,Cheap Carafe,"It's a very good coffeemaker, with auto shutoff and you can program its brewtime, but the cheap carafe drives me nuts. I have been through 3 in 6 months. I am giving up and going back to a coffeemaker with a carafe that is made of heavier glass or that has more protection around the top. The other problem with this product is that even though it says twelve cup the water resevoir only holds ten cups worth, so you can't brew a full pot unless you add water to the resevoir in mid brew. Poor design!!"
4,Swing out basket,"This pot brews quickly, makes good coffee, and has lasted quite awhile. The swing out basket is a nice feature. However, the pot is difficult to clean because the swinging holder is not removable. Also, the removable reservoir only holds 10 cups. If you are making 12 cups, you must leave out the reservoir. All in all, it's been a great coffee maker."
1,Doesn't live up to the brand name.,I purchased this coffee maker in April of this year. Last week it totally quit working. Heating element is burned out already. I'd never buy one of these again.
5,Wow!,"This complex, sweeping saga of a girl's jourrney to find a place and herself is one of the best fantasy books I've every read despite, or because of, its unusual nature. I read it in one sitting--and it's a hefty tome! The almost-19th century Russia is vivid and compelling, as are Ara's struggles and decisions. A naturally passive girl comes to become and courageous and fierce woman. Very human, very real."
2,the magic fades,"This book draws the reader in during the first hundred pages or so with a stunning and beautiful exposition. The world is colourful and innovative, and the characters interesting. However, somewhere in the middle this spell starts to subside. For some strange reason several passages annoyed me to no end, as I watched Aradia travel from place to place like it was a travelogue. The plot has no focus; the first half of the book would have made a better story on its own, since I found myself able to accurately predict every soap-opera occurence which happened thereafter. It's too bad such good prose, crafty dialogue and vivid imagery had to be inserted into such a plot, cause in the end it's really all just a bunch of stuff that happens."
2,A pointless read...,"I started this book, and I finished it. The only thing that kept me reading right up to the last page, is that I just knew that _something_ had to happen _eventually_. I couldn't believe that anyone would have written a 200 plus page novel, without anything taking place between the first and last page.If you're looking for something that you can read, and disengage your brain from, then this book is the one for you. But if you're seeking entertainment, even a 20 year old Harlequin has more punch"
1,Waiting and Waiting and Waiting....,"For something, ANYTHING to happen. As another reader stated, the first 50 pages were not bad, but then... nothing. I read the entire thing, convinced that the author would eventually get to the _the point_ of it all or AT _least_ some sort of climax; and closed the book on the last page, disappointed and disgusted. The friend who lent it to me felt the same way. I have never since read anything else by Tanith Lee (it's been about 15 years), but have been (from reading other reviews) persuaded to pick up one of her other books and try her again. Don't waste your time with this one."
1,"Please, don't bother.","After reading Tanith Lee's ""The Claidi Journal"" series, I thought maybe her other books might be worth reading. Unfortunately, that was not so.""A Heroine of the World"" may be a wonderful book for those fantasy lovers that are into those just-sit-and-wait-for-something-to-happen books. That's just it. There is NO ACTION. It goes on and on (well, the majority of it) about her pathetic love life. When I finished the book, I couldn't help but think to myself ""That's it?"" Practically nothing happens. It is mere nonsense written to fill up pages. I'm sorry, but it might just be me, but this book definitely isn't worth it."
1,"Will something, anything PLEASE happen.","I am a devoted reader of fantasy. I have read some really bad ones in my day. But this book is in my oppinion the WORST fantasy novel I have EVER read. No amount of skimming could help this snoze a minute book for me. This is the first book I ever read by this author and will be the last.If there is a plot in there honest I just couldn't find it. The main character does NOTHING. She whines, she complains, she let's events sweep her along, . . .but she has no impact and never even tries to. Honestly I wanted to reach through the page and smack her. ""Heroine of the World"" ??? I have to assume that was ment irronically."
3,Basic for Beginners,The was is a great over veiw for people just getting started with the reef hobby. However if you are an intermediate hobbiest the book is very basic and you will most likely not learn anything that you do not know. If your new its a good book to start with.
4,Good reference,"I like the pictures & the info is good for a reef beginner like me. I've had freshwater tanks for years, so the basic salt intro was what I needed & this fits the bill."
2,cheap book,"the details are very limited, the table of contents doesn't show common names, most if not all are scientific names of corals only. The index isn't helping..."
1,Not so great,"I don't think the book has ""The latest scientific discoveries and aquarium techniques for keeping and propagating living corals"", as it advertises. It has only 2 chapters related to corals, with little really interesting information (even for a newbie). The rest of chapters have aquarium generalities exposed by a PhD in a complex language. Don't waste your time on this one."
2,Way too technical,"This book was thoroughly disappointing. Provided OK information, but was entirely too technical in its approach. If you do not have a Ph.D. in biology then do not bother with this book, you will not understand it."
4,Very informative and interesting.,"My folks have started to collect ocean things to put into this ""tide-pool aquarium"" they built... and finding books on the subject turned out to be a bit harder than I thought. I picked up this book since it contained not only information on the various sea-life but also what they eat, their habitats and so on."
4,Bright and Useful,"I first saw this at the CES 2006 show. I decided to order some for a media room that I'm building. Once I got it I was impressed at how bright it was! It seems brighter than the stuff I saw at the show.Anyway, I plan on routing a thin groove in the underside of some step molding and slipping this into the groove. It will keep people from tripping on the step and supply enough of a gentle light so you can see the step.Cool stuff."
4,pretty cool,This item is pretty cool and at a great Amazon price. I plan to use it in a built in display cabinet to illuminate some special serving dishes. Since I'll only turn it on when we have company the batteries will work fine but I would love to find a safe adapter to use with them. I bought while and it's totally cool. thinking about buying red for Christmas decorating.
5,Excellent stuff! More metalheads need to hear this! It put a smile on my face.,"I like the intro, it's really takes you into the theme of the album. This is 11 tracks of good ol' fashioned Thrash Metal at it's finest. You hear the other reviewers on here. They agree with me. So check this album out if you come across it. Heck, go 'head and and buy this with the new Sodom album. 2 great albums worth the money you shell out for metal this year."
2,Presentation method lacking,"While this method seems to have some very useful information its fails miserably in one key area. Its fails to present the information in the context of songs. Its presents chords with drill style excercise you could play with a meteronme = boring will not keep my attention. If only the writer could go back and take a more of a ""Blues You Can Use"" style appoarch he would have a real winner here. So unless he rewrites this book with intresting songs to acompany the material presented, steer clear of this book and buy something better."
4,"Good price/quality, design makes it tip over","The design of this box is cool and efficient, but in my car it falls on its face during regular driving! A simple $5 trip to Home Depot and I've got it secured in my trunk and I'm happier than ever!"
2,Not MDF,The box I received is not medium density fiberboard it's cheap particleboard. If the product is made in china expect inferior quality. I gave it 2 stars because the carpeting wasn't bad.
1,So little for so much!,"This jewelry armoire arrived on time, but that was about the only good thing about it! Several of the drawers had chipped corners, and you could see where some areas had been chipped and unsuccessfully stained to match.one drawer front had been glued on crookedly, and sat in the chest at an angle. I filled out the parts form provided and faxed it to the company, no response. I then e mailed them, and received the new drawers within 7 days. Unfortunately the new parts had problems too. One of the drawers had been drilled twice for a drawer pull, which makes the hole too big and the pull wiggled. One of the drawers came with a mashed up corner, and the third was a very dark stain that really doesn't match. I do not want to deal with a company that has such poor products, however, I guess I will have to keep at it until we get it right. Buyer beware, for a high price, you are buying a problem!"
3,Damaged from manufacturer,"This item was exactly what we were looking for, but like the other review, this one too had a small scratch on the outside top edge of second drawer and about a 1 inch scratch inside the top drawer (front/top) that was down to the wood.Contacted Amazon.com after hunting down the phone number and was on hold phone for 30 minutes trying to get a replacement ordered. Yes, that had something to do with my rating. Was specific in description should someone else receive this same unit."
4,Wife loved it !!!,Bought this as a surprise Christmas gift for my wife and she was thrilled with it so therefore I am as well. Had to return the first one though due to shipping damage. The packing is a little weak in my opinion for such a heavy item but the replacement arrived unscathed. The unit itself is well made and a nice piece of furniture.
4,Great fun,"I really liked this DVD of Bam and Missy. However, I was a little disappointed that there were no bonus features. Also, since Bam is a music lover, I thought I would be able to see a ""soundtrack"" or list of the songs from the DVD, but there was no mention of the music in the credits. All in all though, it is a great DVD!"
5,Bam at his best.,"If you loved Viva la Bam this is a must see. Bam at his best. It is particularly interesting to watch Bam interact with Misty, her family and April his mother. In some ways he is completely out of his element, yet obviously very much in love and wanting to please. The humor and fun of CKY and Viva la Bam are all there, though some Bam's crew are missing. If you are a CKY or Jackass fan this is a must own. Also check out his latest feature; Minghags the Movie. Enjoy."
5,Finally..,"I watched this on MTV when it was on back in 2007 and have it on my iPod, but have waiting for it to come out on DVD."
2,Very Cool Looking Blue Nightlight,"This clock makes a lovely nightlight. However, the radio is very tinny sounding and reception reminds me of an AM radio. Unless you are looking exactly straight at the clock, those huge blue numbers are almost impossible to read due to glare. It does do a wonderful job of lighting up the entire bathroom at night, though."
3,I should have listened to others about its brightness,"I read earlier reviews complaining about it being too bright, I thought since it has a dimmer button then it can't be that bad- oh how wrong I was, I should have taken their advice. It lights up the whole room like a lamp. I had to move it to my closet shelf to tolerate it.The other functions on the clock are good, but as an owner of this clock I only recommend it if you don't mind having a bright blue night-light shining while you sleep."
1,Paperweight,Good clock if you never want to know the time. The numbers are just not visible unless you are looking directly at it.
5,Horor at its best,"THE WHISPERER AND OTHER VOICES is an anthology consisting of a long novella (or is that a short novel as advertised by Tor?) and eight short stories. Each of the short stories is well written and for the most part pays homage to Lovecraft. They run the gamut from graveyard serious horror to satirical humor. The amusing tales like ""The Lustone"" show how talented Brian Lumley is as he provides an amusing twist to top his usual works. The title piece is classic horror that hits the reader in the gut. The novella, ""The Return of the Deep Ones"" is a journey into the deepest reaches of Lovecraftian environs. Fans of the author and those of Lovecraft will relish this devotion to the great writer while realizing how good Mr. Lumley is even outside his popular series.Harriet Klausner"
2,Kindle content review,"This is only a review of the Kindle content aspect of this book. It appears that no or very limited editing was attempted prior to release. The Kindle version is full of typos, misspellings, wrong words and just plain missing words. The font size changes several times a page. Over all it just was not worth the effort to read. This is the first and hopefully the last Kindle version that I will return for such gross formating errors. The publisher really needs to put just a little effort into reviewing its product prior to trying to sell it. I was very disapointed in the production of this edition as I am a huge Lumley fan. I suppose that I will have to buy the DTB version to read it as the Kindle version is totally unreadable."
4,R.I.P. Biggie,"This album has all of Biggie Smalls (The Notorious B.I.G.) greatest hits like Juicy, Big Poppa, Hypnotize........ I could go on and on whats on this album. Biggie was one of the best and so is this album."
4,"Scary, powerful cats","There are ten wild cats depicted in this little book. All are realistically rendered, most are heads but four of them are fully drawn designs. They snarl and stalk and pounce across the page and are popular with younger girls and boys. I passed some of these out last year at Halloween, and the kids were delighted. There's a beautiful full body jaguar, leopard, ocelot, and snow leopard. The others are the snarling heads of a black panther, a tiger, a jaguar, a clouded leopard, a cougar, and a lion."
2,nursing mothers beware,This book is mostly for non-nursing mothers. Only one chapter is dedicated to nursing mothers and it isn't very encouraging. If you are planning on nursing your baby I wouldn't buy this book. I was disappointed.
4,Sound advice and easy to read!,"My second baby is 14 weeks old and I have lost 44 pounds of the 46 I gained. Sound advice, easy to read. But I must confess that after the 8th week I had to cut down on the amount of food Levine recommends but this could be because I have a very small frame. I also found that his menu plans do not include enough fruit and have included some, just because I love it."
2,Not good for indian chappatis/rotis,"If you are planning to buy this for making rotis/chappatis, dont buy this. It doesn't flatten the dough enough, and hence can never make the roti that we are used to."
3,Not that bad,"I have owned one of these for one year. The negative reviewers are correct - it really doesn't make flatbreads from scratch (tortillas, breads) well at all. However it does a nice job making flatbreads from biscuit dough. I really use it mostly for heating ready made tortillas, making quesadillas by heating the tortillas below & then finishing on top in the frypan portion. Also does a nice job cooking home fries and is easy enough for my 10 year old to make himself sunny side up eggs cooked perfectly every time with warm tortillas or tortilla wraps. I think of it more as a southwestern breakfast device. Reviewers are correct in that it is big, and the frying pan needs to be wiped out. Bottom line is that at this discounted price if you have the room and want to experiment its worth a try."
1,Making Tortillas,I purchased this a couple weeks ago and just got it in the mail. There was no user manual in it but a piece of paper that said to go to useandcares.hamiltonbeach.com to print one out. I can't find it anywhere. If anyone knows where I can get a user's manual I would appreciate having one because I am not exactly sure how to use this.
2,Not hot enough to cook authentic tortillas - too rubbery,"My wife cooks the traditional Mexican food she grew up with at least 5 times a week. We purchased this machine so that she could make tortillas quickly. Unfortunately, the unit does not get hot enough to cook the tortillas properly. The resulting flat bread is rubbery and lacks the proper consistency. By following some of the additional recipes, we made bread suitable for roll-ups or desert wrappings, but it was *impossible* to reproduce traditional tortillas cooked on a hot gridle.If you are attempting to make a real Mexican tortilla, this is not a substitute for a cast iron gridle."
2,Disappointing,"I had read several positive reviews before I bought this. Number One: it is much too big for my kitchen. The specs are somewhat minimized in the description. Number Two: the tortillas do not press out thinly enough---the upper part of the press is too flimsy. Until a better machine comes out, I'll just roll and cook my own on the stove. This appliance will only come out when I need to take it to a party to cook tortillas, which will probably be rare to never."
2,I was hoping for this to work better....,"I bought this thinking it would be a great kitchen help...since I have used the roti-maker in the past and it works wonderfully...However with this flat bread maker I have the follwoing issues.....1. Its too big for my kitchen, the description somehow given didnt make it seem so...occupies too much counter space--I have a small kitchen..2. The dough doesnot get flattened enough...not thin enough...remains very thick...3. The machine makes strange sound while cooking the bread and sometimes splits it with a boom...(doesnot cook it well..so the inside is uncooked)4.And not the least, the included instructions somehow donot explain the process well enough...I would really appreciate if someone who has found this product a great help give some tips or usage directions they ""invented/discovered"" and that may probably help me use this effeciently.."
5,Beats the old way...,"After a little getting used to this new unit, I found out that this is an excellent tortilla and crepe maker. In about 35 seconds you can have a fresh made flour tortilla ready to go, speaking of which it' time to heat up the unit and make fresh rollups for lunch, really!"
2,Not good for Lefse.,"Got one to try and have a quick and easy way of ""pressing"" lefse for a Scandinavian festival booth, but could not even get it to work in the kitchen. Haven't tried making torts, but sure it would do better with them than the lefse. Lefse's consistancy just will not allow for this quicker and easier method. Another point is it's BIG, so better have counter space, or a nice place to store another kitchen appliance. :-)"
1,Company will not accept *any* returns.,"Beware that if you open this box and it does not do as you expect this company will not accept a return under any circumstance even if the item is unused, brand new with all packing, etc.."
5,A must have for the Cult fan.,"Each of the CDs has a different feel to them. The remixes of many of the songs show the diversity of the band. The first CD and the bonus 7th CD are my favorites. As some of the previous reviewers stated, this is not for the casual Cult fan. If you have all of the other albums, them you NEED this one."
1,rare cult? more like repetitive cult!,"o.k. it might live up to ""rare cult"" being demos, remixes, and radio sessions of hard to find songs, but it also lives up to being ""repetitve cult"" having most of the songs covering Dreamtime through The Cult as the demos (same songs with different titles and lyrics), remixes (very long and boring dance mixes of rock songs! they are a rock band, right?), and radio sessions (which are actually BBC sessions and are worth while, but once again the same songs). The hyped lost album - Peace, is just Electric with a few different songs. But, the different songs are pretty good. The demos from Sonic Temple that did not make the album are really good. But, there are only a few. Listening to this really makes me crave to buy Southern Death Cult, Death Cult, Dreamtime, Love, Electric, and Sonic Temple on CD..."
1,"One Star? Geez, was suppossed to be six!",Six stars (or more...computer can't handle anything greater than five I guess.) LIVE music is always better. And this is really kool for recorded stuff. GET SASSY!!!
5,Personal leadership first,"Authentic Leadership emphasizes personal leadership as a prerequisite to leading others. Personal leadership as I understand it, is the ability to crystallize your thinking to estabish and commit to a meaningful direction in life. I agree with the contents of this book and recommend it for the aspiring leader. I also strongly recommed Optimal Thinking-How To Be Your Best Self to OPTIMIZE your personal leadership, bring out the best in others and create the best outcomes."
4,"Great show, a must have for Unsolved Mysteries lovers","This is an awesome collection of Unsolved Mystery shows on DVD. The only thing is, is that it's seperated by topics instead of full shows. It's still an awesome buy!"
1,TOO EXPENSIVE,"this is ridiculously priced, you could buy each of the individual packages entitled ""Ghosts"" ""Miracles"" ""UFO's"" etc. and added up they still wouldn't be priced as high as this item. Don't get ripped off, buy the individual packages."
4,good earrings,Good quality earrings. The gems are darker than the photo and the inner side of the the hoop is not solid. more detail int he photos would be helpful. my girl loved them and liked the design on the tail end of the hoop after the gemstones.
5,"PETITE, TASTEFUL, AND LOVELY!","I purchased these amethyst earrings as a 60th birthday gift for my favorite cousin. I thought they were beautiful when I received them. My cousin cried when I gave them to her....because she thought they were beautiful, too!These are not large 'hoops', but they are quite lovely and in very good taste. The channel setting of the stones is both classic and modern-looking....and you won't catch a hair strand on any prongs.Gentlemen, your lady won't be disappointed. Ladies? Indulge yourselves and buy these...the price is right!"
3,Smaller Than I Wanted,I purchased it as a gift but had to return it because it was quite smaller than I expected. I read some comment saying it was smaller and had some expection but still it is too small.And I do not think it is that pretty neither when you look at the real thing. I think it is better to get a bigger one even you have to pay some more.
1,Too Tiny for a larger woman,I was thoroughly disgusted with the size of these earrings. I shouldhave read other's reviews before purchasing them. The topaz is prettybut hardly visible. Surely they come in a larger size.
1,Baby Earrings,"This are not adult earrings this are baby earrings. I was very dissapointed with their size. Quality was good I think my wife will keep them for one of my grandaughters, or return them, I don't know. Thank for a ruined christmas gift."
3,Disappointed,"I thought they would have been larger and you could hardley see the Amethyst stones , I hope next time I buy I will be happier ."
4,38wdeez,"Nice quality gold earrings. Really impressive for price point. Unsure of quality of stones, but overall they are a good pair of everyday use earrings and get lots of nice comments."
2,"Tiny, Not Bright Color, Non-Secure Closure, Yet Overall Pretty","The earings are really small (which I do not mind), the blue is barely noticible (which I do mind since the color is the whole purpose of buying blue topaz) and the closure is not secure - I lost one of the earings the second time I wore them (kinda mind that as well :) ). When you look at them though, they are pretty and understated. Although I am not entirely sure that I can make this statement since I have only one of them now :)."
5,A great gift for any age.,I bought these earrings for my daughter when she turned 12. She has had them for two years now and still wears them every single day. I think that says it all.
5,14k Yellow Gold Channel Set Round Blue Topaz Hoop Earrings,"Great value, quality and craftsmanship; back-up with excellent service!The stones are clear and brilliant.Thanks!R. Caspers5 out of 5 stars...Jewelry"
3,nice but...,this item is nice but to small. the stones are to close together. they hang good but still so small.
4,"Perfect gift, well received by my wife",She loves the color of the stones and says the size is just perfect. Another gift that hit the mark. Recommend for you guys trying to find something special for her.
3,good news/bad news,"Well...the good news about the new Type O is that it's classic TON. If you're a fan, you'll dig it. ""All Hallows Eve"" is typical fare...these guys have got something about this time of year, don't they? ""White Slavery"", ""Everyone I Love is Dead"" & ""Pyretta Blaze"" (complete with an almost Cheap Trick sounding bridge) are the other standout tracks. And the Beatles' ""Day Tripper"" medley is pretty good, most notably their addition of a ""I Want You (She's So Heavy)"" cover...which is what they should have covered in the first place.The bad news...it's classic TON. In other words, with the exception of the bridge in ""Pyretta Blaze"", there's no real growth here. And as usual, they seem intent on filling 75 minutes on a cd, sometimes with a bit of filler & by needlessly extending the songs.If in a gothic/Halloween mood, there's nothing better than Type O Negative. But outside of that...this one doesn't bode too many repeated listenings."
5,A fan of TON,"I just got the new Type O Negative CD and that is all I have listened to. My husband died on Tuesday and I received the CD on Wednesday. It is so strange how this CD is about death and all. I listened to it ALL DAY Sat. & Sun. The music is really great, not to mention the singer's voice. Anyone who doesn't like this CD can send me their copy because I'm sure I will have to order another one because I'm going to wear this one out!! Keep up the good work TON."
4,A Masterpiece,"I'm not a big Type O Negative fan...but this is an excellent album. Very slow, heavy, and melodic. If you like the more upbeat sound of the previous albums, then you will probably want to pass this one up...but if you are a fan of the dark and gloomy side of Type O Negative, then this album is for you."
5,Musical Progression,"If you enjoy Type O's previous two albums you will most likely enjoy this. It is much more riff oriented than most of their other albums. I notice that the songes tend to have a slightly faster tempo on average that their previous albums as well. The lyrics of this album deal a lot more with death unlike how Bloody Kisses and October Rust dealt more with sex.If you are looking to the emotion driven music of Type O Negative, you will continue to find it in the new album, just with a slighty different style than the past few albums."
4,v. impressed!,"Having just heard `everything dies' I have converted to TON and bought the `October Rust' album which I will listen to soon. This is music with soul and atmosphere, and an amazing vocalist."
3,is type o negative still the same ?,"What draws me first listening the record is pete's voice...thin...less dark and gloomy than before.Is pete a pop singer?I don't think so ! Go back pete, we miss you! There isn't a real atmosphere in the album,just songs and interlude badly enchained...excepting a few songs which allow us to hope about the next LP. TRY AGAIN GUYS YOU SHOULD DO BETTER........(I'm sure!)"
2,World & Income & Popularity Coming Down,"I ran out on the 21st to buy this. And after listeining to it, am very dissapointed. It has a sound more like TON's earlier years, which isn't bad but dissapointing after the genious display of talent of October Rust. This album is nothing to glorify, and will be nothing special."
4,"Slow, Depressing but with inner passion and feeling..","Peter Steele and co have brought out a selection of classic albums and songs over the years however, none of their albums has the emotion and feeling of World Coming Down. As someone who has recently lost family members in a tragic accident, songs like ""Everything Dies"" and ""Everyone I love is Dead"" fill me with the knowledge that others suffer the same as myself. It helps you continue. Music really is a great outlet for life and Type O Negative are the best band for depressed people. Quote from Peter ""Ever since Betty died.. I've had a feeling of sadness with me... a feeling which will last forever""... you have to feel sympathy for peter steele."
1,most boring thing ive ever heard,"This is the most boring thing ive ever heard and like the rest of their albums this is nothing but slow and boring, and the guy has to have the worst vocals in the history of music, he is shocking.ANother no talent, boring, mindless band"
4,Typical O Negative,"Fans of Type O Negative know what to expect, and won't be let down with ""World Coming Down."" As far as the band acquiring a new fan base, without any one song strong enough to lure the masses (""All Hallows Eve"" comes closest to ""Black No. 1"", but not close enough), they'll have to make do with the moderate legion they've gained thus far. Stepping back to the sounds of ""Bloody Kisses,"" and without the drenched mood of their underrated epic ""October Rust,"" ""World Coming Down"" has it's share of depressing moments (""Everyone I Love Is Dead""), but also it's moments of unusal Type O joy (""Pyretta Blaze""). Everything else falls between, with plenty of homages to autumn, Halloween, death and bloodlust. Then again, Type O fans come to expect that. Others will remain skeptical."
4,Good Cd,"I happen to like this CD better than October Rust, it is more true to Type O's other music. It isn't Bloody Kisses, but who expects it to be? Don't be dense enough to not move on to something new!"
4,Great Album....But Not the Best,"Although the album contains many great songs, there aren't many slower songs that have more feeling. To me the album sounded like T.O.N. was being influenced to change their sound for this album. Don't get me wrong I'm not saying this is a bad record if you are a fan of true rock/metal music then definitly get this album but if your hoping for some good 'ol Type O Negative this may not be the album you are looking for. Keep Rockin'"
5,Their best yet,"In my opinion, Type O's fifth is their best yet. The dirty, fuzz-laden guitars are a fresh diversion from October Rust's for the most part airy and meandering sound: this is a 100% hard album. And while the songs are hard, Kenny's keyboards make their presence known, injecting melody into the equation. Almost all of the songs are great, especially ""Pyretta Blaze,"" ""Creepy Green Light,"" and the title track. This is a fun album to sing along to, and it gets me feeling good despite the somewhat foreboding subject matter. My only complaint: they should've killed the useless seques and stuck some more tunes on the disc. All in all, incredible, I can't show my love for this record enough. Peter, please don't disband if the sales expectations aren't met; you're doing it all right."
5,Whats the matter?,"Slightly Progressive rock/a bit of goth satire/nice night time mooding/ and yet still holds many even mainstream and goth crowds totally captivated. That alone says alot for Type O Negative filling the right gap for so many people. I dont know how the album rating games works. Its seems biased per stand out song too often. Impatient instant gratification... perhaps. I think this album lb. for lb. is as good as ""October Rust"". There are more impressive songs on ""October Rust"" but for myself... the journey is what I pay for. I'm not big on buying singles. There are some awesome songs here no doubt and no song grabs ahold of me as being mediocre here either.This album is really good. Get this and ""October Rust"" for certin and then give yourself a big fat cookie."
4,Finally a Band Who Hasnt Changed Past 4,"TON Has greatly won my respect with this album. Too many bands have altered from their original sound after 3 albums, TON, has not, they are sticking to their guns, and still pounding out the dark, melodic sound. Steele's vocals are amazing mixed with the cutting guitar lines. This is a album to make you think, and reflect."
2,Not that bad,"Ok so I'm not the biggest TON fan. I just like how they don't take themselves and a scene too seriously. I decided to get this new offering after hearing Everything Dies on the radio. Guess what? It's the best or most palitable song on the record. The record's ok. Not as good as Bloody Kisses. Well, good is subjective so, not as catchy as Bloody Kisses. Maybe I just have to listen to it more. Don't be fooled by the intro. That's all I have to say."
2,"Not the best album, and definetely the worst.","What the HELL happened Pete. I mean, October Rust, Bloody Kisses and Slow, Deep and Hard were what you created with feel and inspiration. Maybe this album is created just to keep the fans aware that Type O Negative is still ""alive"", and to reassure yourself that they still remember you and your great music. Well, I've been a Type O fan for about four years now, and trust me out of all of the things in this world, the last thing I'd do is forget you guys and your tunes. I find it very dissapointing to rate this album the lowest out of all of your recordings, and I really hope that next time when you come up with an idea like this album, I suggest you think twice before making a harsh decision like this one! (Sorry for the criticism, but I guess the truth hurts...)"
2,what!?,"i waited and waited for this cd to come out and i was sssoooo dissapointed. Its nothing like there most brilliant and astounding creation ""October Rust"" which was way to good for words. 2 stars because they still have it in them, its just not in this album."
2,"Slow, deep, and wandering","The songs on this album seem to wander with no plan. It's more like reading to music than it is singing to music. The album also goes overboard with sound effects tracks, so keep the remote control handy."
3,Don't,"This was not a purchase I would advise others to make. If you like Type O, buy another one of their CD's, not this one. Not that it's horrible, but many songs left me bored, and there aren't any lyrical marvels either. I would recommend Bloody Kisses, or The Least Worst Of albums unless you're an absolute fan."
2,What have they been doing for three years?,"I am very disapointed in this album. October Rust is on constant rotation in my car;this one has yet to be played through. I don't understand what the TON guys have been doing for the last three years.Definately not working on a new sound! This album is just generic. Save the Sane is horrible! Sounds like it was written in the shower. Darnit! I love this band and waited forever for something new. A definate regression. There are a few decent songs like Everyone I know is Dead, but not enough to satisfy."
5,One of the best albums I've heard in a long time!,"This is just a brilliant disc, sounding like no one but Type O Negative. The band sounds tighter than ever, but at the same time this album has a looser feel than previous albums. More confident, even. TON keep getting better and better! Get this disc!!"
3,The Lords of Flatbush ditch lavish production,"Type O, again pushes deep into the realms of death, masculenity and passion,but they do so without the lush production and well thought out arrangments that made October Rust a hit amongst die hard fans and first time listers alike. However,there are some truly brialent moments included; The haunting opening riff to ""Everyone I Love Is Dead"" and the jazz influenced keyboard line of ""Who Will Save The Sane."" The album art is phenonenal and Peter, allthough ambiguously, begans to shed a little more light on his very mistereous life."
3,weird,"I am not a goth fan, nor am I very familar with the genre, but when I heard ""everything dies"" on the radio, I was blown away by the song, and I had to get this CD. There is something about that song that just got to me, and I can't really describe what it is about it. The song is creepy in the sense that the song is about death, yet a little ways in the song you got people cheering! The osng is sad, yet not depressing, at least to me anyway, it powerful, that's for sure, the rest of the album is so-so, I liked creepy green light, pyretta blaze, everyone I love is dead, this is not an album you take on a date, unless you want them to shoot themselves. This stuff isn't for everyone, but after my CD's got stolen, this is one of the few I plan on buying again."
5,Into the Darkness,"This album is a masterpiece of dark metal. This is the album I was crying out for all those times when I lay in a dark room, depressed about life. Stand out tracks such as 'Everyone I Love Is Dead', 'Creepy Green Light' and 'Everything Dies' are wonderfully dark but emotional reflections on life. I love to listen to this album in a dark room full of candles, while I hang from the ceiling and watch my life, slowly dripping away."
4,"The latest from Type-O, my favorite group","Another fine recording from a very unique group of fine musicians! I love the re-recording of the classic song ""Day Tripper""! I recommend it to any fan of music that's packed with punch and lots of enthusiasim and these guys have it! Thanks for the great album!"
3,"Good, but only b/c it's Type O","You can't go into this album expecting October Rust or Bloody Kisses, and I didn't, but I did expect a bit more anger juxtaposed amid the electric brooding. If I had to rack and stack this album, it would be behind the previously mentioned releases, but that doesn't make it a bad album."
4,A decent next album for TON,"I suppose I'm not the greatest TON fan, as I really really loved October Rust, but couldn't stand Bloody Kisses or Slow, Deep and Hard. I review World Coming Down as not as strong and gripping as RUST was, but certainly better than the other two albums mentioned.I appreciated the bleak ""LUNG"", ""LIVER"" and ""SINUS"" tracks, kinda of like tracks found on Queensryche's 'Promised Land'. They add an air of etherial sleepyness and dread to the album, quite appropriate for the style IMO.Peter's ghostly voice is used in force, (one of TON's great virtues) however, less emphasis is placed on the digital reverb piano effects so well used on RUST's 'Love You To Death'.I'd buy it again and would recommend it for all RUST lovers."
4,Good,"But not great.Truth be told it really only deserves 3 stars, but i'm giving it one more because....well...dispite all it's flaws, i kinda liked it.The big problem here as far as i'm concerned is that it all seems like more style than substance : the music's fine, the cover is pretty but overall the whole package seems pretty uninspired. There a couple of moments where you'll go 'wow,' (or at least i did), but they're all too fleeting. Ultimately, there's nothing here you haven't heard before. It kinda reminds me of a cross between lacuna coil and a watered down version of nightwish.Don't get me wrong though, it's not all bad.They are a good band and they do have some talent. Actually, i think they have a lot of potential....if they can find a way to distingish themselves from the rest of the pack.All and all, it's definatly worth a listen. Just don't buy it expecting a masterpiece, that's all."
3,Meh.,"Solid album, with only a few redeeming songs. Unless, like myself, you insist on owning albums in their entirety, buy only the songs you prefer in the preview section."
2,FRUSTRATION!!!,"This game has all the earmarks for a superb game. The graphics are outstanding, the AI excellent, the overall look of the game is fantastic. The one thing that made me throw it in the trash however, is the loss of in game saves if you want to quit for awhile and come back later. In other words, lets say you play an hour, and decide you want to turn off the pc, or go mess around in another program so you save your game and close the program. Well, surprise! When you come back you HAVE TO START THE LEVEL ALL OVER!!!! This is pitiful! You have to complete a level at one sitting or you have lose everything. What were they smoking when they wrote THAT part of the game! My pc has been ""wiped clean"" of this frustration!"
3,Really fun with one BIG problem.,"Well, if you are a fan of the Hitman series you will really enjoy this new installment in the Hitman series.The game has one BIG flaw. The game does not allow you to save your place within missions. What I mean is that if you have to stop in the middle of a mission, the game will not allow you to save your place within the particular mission you are on. It will take you back to the beginning of the mission you are currently playing.Overall I HIGHLY recommend this game!"
5,interesting game,"I love this game it first person shooter, like previous Hitmen. The only problem I had was my computer- not good enough grafic card. But game v. involving. Strongly recommended."
5,Great game but technical problems,"I absolutely LOVE this game. It played fine up 'til around level 5 or 6, then started crashing. Tech support told me to update my video card drivers, which I did. I could then play that next level, but upon completion, it crashed again. Re-installing and *NOT* applying the 1.2v patch allows me to play just fine. This kinda stuff really bothers me for those of us that are actually buying the games.Gameplay is awesome, I hope they release a new one. Just yesterday I played for 8 hours! Wasted the whole day, but I had fun. I'd recommend this title for the PC."
3,Well Done!,"I love the 47 series and have been playing them since the start, and each one gets better and better. This game sort of stands alone in the series of Hitman. The game has many ways to complete objectives which = replay value. The AI is better, the close combat is greatly improved, and I love the upgrades to the weapons with pregression through levels.This game is a must have for any fan of the hitman series!The few gripes I have about the game is that the collosion is horrible as well as the rag doll. The sound is mediocre, and the overall game play is good. The game could have been made a little better with more interaction with the environment, but overall this is a great game."
5,Perfect,"Anybody that tells you they enjoyed Splinter Cell, but Hitman is linear has obviously never played either. Splinter Cell is the most linear boring video game ever created, however Hitman is perfect. Enjoy."
1,Won't work,Impossible requirements for the game meant that it wouldn't run on my machine. Had to return it.
1,Missing the necessary drivers,"How can I say if the game is any good or not? I can't play since the drivers to run directX 9.0c don't come with the CD and I'm not where I can download 'em. This stinks. I am a big Hitman fan, and this sort of cheesy runaround, expecially at a premium price, is way out of line."
4,A very well done stealth-action game,"This is one of my favorite game series of all time. I truly love the Hitman games because they have some of the greatest executions of all stealth games. This one is also great gameplay, in every mission there is a ton of ways to complete them. You can even make alot of the executions look like accidents. Drop a chandelier on a group of Mafia bad guys, knock some bad guys over a railing into alligator infested swamps, and even strangle a guy on the bench-press with the bar! There are just so many ways to kill! But my one annoyance is the freaking AI! It is so unpredictable sometimes, I had to restart the mission. But if you do not let this get to you, Hitman is one of the best series you will play."
5,In the Bag.....,"We already have a slightly smaller version of this product. We were so pleased with the first one we junked the backpack my wife carries and gave her the smaller one. The small detachable ""day bag"" allows us to carry our cameras on trips and outings. Five stars out of five."
3,overall it is nice backpack,"I got this backpack in June 2009, for my son trip to Europe. After one month traveling all over the Europe, he came back, but backpack had broken wheel .At this time we are waiting for repair or exchange."
5,"Agustin Lara, Su Musica y Piano","It is rare to find instrumental recordings of Lara's music by Lara himself. The value for any musician and listener is that these recordings represent Agustin Lara's idea of what the music should sound like. It is like listening to someone like Ruben Gonzalez, that is, a musician with a total understanding of the music he is interpreting, but with an added dimension: here, Lara actually composed the music. This is a very enjoyable recording, and you will find yourself smiling as you listen to the Maestro."
5,Same as from the auto parts store but less expensive,Product is the same you will find in any auto parts store. compare the price. came quickly and without any complaints.
3,lg vx 6100 battery,I bought this as a backup and it should be used as just that. I have found that it doesn't hold a charge as long as the original that came with the phone. I wouldn't use it as a primary battery.
5,Living God's Will,Living God's Will (Following God Discipleship Series)Great study book to do solo or in a group. Have studied other books by this author and enjoyed them thoroughly.
4,better than good,"Hard, progressive trance. He has good instincts, but could up the tempo a little bit without being confused with hardcore. Enough of the tracks are hard - with dramatic breaks - that I thoroughly enjoy the CD regularly."
3,Errors,"Really let down by the errors. I was only through half of chapter one and found three errors in the book's answers. The book seems decent but with the errors I can only give it 3 stars. If I'm able to catch these simple errors, it makes me wonder how the author could miss these?After chapter one, the book seemed to have less errors. The actual content is pretty good. I found the stoichiometry section particularly helpful."
2,Answers to problems not always correct !,I'm a chemistry novice...and it's real confusing when the answers to problems are incorrect. You think that you aren't grasping basics and waste loads of time checking and re-checking. I haven't even finished the book--am only in chapter 2. Disappointing.
2,Easy to Read / Practice Problems have errors?,"Pros:Easy To ReadConcepts explained in simple, concise sentencesCons:Answers to some practice problems are incorrectAs a new student of Chemistry, unable to determine what is accurate/correct & what is not...Purchased this in anticipation of enrolling into a college level General Chemistry course, with the intent of 'getting ahead' while I had free time. But as I started working throught the Chapter 1 practice questions, I noticed the answer key had some glaring errors (problems 1.9 & 1.17, for example). I'm literally with in the first 6 pages of the book & I, a novice, am finding mathematical errors?Makes me wonder if I should trust anything I read in this..."
4,Outstanding explainations and worked problems.,"This is a wonderful introduction to Organic Chemistry. Klein explains things in a way that can be understood quickly and offers many problems with the solutions available. GREAT!The reason it gets only 4 stars is after Section 8.8, there are lots and lots of pages (basically blank) with instructions to look in your text book and fill these in. Or to fill them in with notes from class."
4,Great Help,"This book was a great help for me. It is written in completely unassuming language, and does a great job of explaining the concepts. Gives examples very much like what I saw in my textbook. Definitely worth buying!"
2,Stop Falling Apart!,"Six months after we received it as a gift, it started falling apart every time we used it."
1,Plastic & metal don't mix,I have had to replace the blade for the can opener 2 times & I got it for Christmas 2002. The metal keeps breaking the plastic that guides the blade onto the can.
1,"Cheap construction, not worth the price.","I purchased the two-drawer version from another retailer, and this thing is a piece of junk. It's an all-wooden construction with strips of vinyl hastily glued to the sides. The first time I attempted to open the case, strips of vinyl from the outer walls of the drawer peeled back and became stuck to the inside of the casing, preventing the drawer from opening. The whole thing just feels cheap, and I feel that I shouldn't have to super-glue something that I paid this much money for."
1,Poor Construction,"These are made of MDF, not wood as some reviewers state. The MDF is covered in vinyl. The problem is that the vinyl is not glued solidly to the MDF and it peels off. This prevents the drawers from opening as the friction pulls the vinyl off and folds it under the drawer. Over time it gets worse and worse. I'd recommend looking elsewhere."
4,Fine storage,I purchased three of the four drawer units about a year ago. The design must have been changed since I don't have the same construction with the drawers. Mine don't appear to have the glued on surface. They work fine. I'm supprised to see the negative posts. The only reason I'm here is because I'm about to order my fouth unit. The only suggestion I'd make is to forget the locks on some units. I don't think most people use them.
3,Drawers are not interchangeable,"After reading other reviews and seeing other Vaultz products at the store I was not expecting the cabinet to be perfect and it isn't. Three of the drawers worked fine, one was a little tight from top to bottom. So I tried each drawer in different openings and then none of them fit. That gives you an idea of the quality of construction. There is no way to adjust the opening as the unit is riveted together. After I put the drawers back in their original positions, I tapped the upper part of the opening on the tight fitting drawer with a rubber mallet. It worked and the drawer fits better. The unit should last forever because I will be using it maybe once a day. If you need a cabinet that will be in constant use, get a different cabinet. Ordered DiscSavers Slim CD Jewel Cases to use in the cabinet. They fit great and I like them best of all the CD cases I have used (but that is a different review)."
5,great,Great design the Cabinet replaced two less sturdy cabinets. This is used to hold equipment software and is used daily it looks like it will hold up for a long time.
5,It works very well,I used this to hold all my DVDs for a while and I have well over 100. There was still room to spare. now I use it to hold games. I got the Case Logic CD Prosleeve Pages to put the discs in and I got the Vaultz storage file guides. The only thing I would do different is get sleeves with hanging tabs on them since they would fit perfectly and not fall over inside.
3,Buyer be aware.,"I was very excited to find these drawers for my CDs. I also like how they fit in the limited space I set up for them. There is one thing, though, about their construction. When I tried to lift one of the drawers filled with CDs to align it in its slot, the front of the drawer just broke off! I was stunned because they look so good in the picture! I am not inclined to return it as it took me a long time to find this cabinet. I am in the process of repairing the drawer. So buyer be aware. The drawers need to be handled with care."
1,"Someone said he plays beautifully, but I feel he plays in a dead dog way",other musical instruments are added making the ballade music become some weird stuff.sounds like old old old semi-dicso music.I could not help myself to crack the CD.
3,A collection of magazine articles...,"This was okay, but I got it as a gift and would not purchase it myself. It is basically a collection of magazine articles and gets pretty redundant. It isn't authorized or endorsed by Oprah or her company, and looks to be a shallow collection of reiterations of the same things. If you love Oprah, you already know everything in this book :-)."
4,A Golf Caddy Growing Up,"Jim Mooney, 17, is growing up in a small Jersey town about 40 miles west of New York. He caddies at the local golf course. He hangs out with the other caddies. Much of their spare time is spent drinking and playing cards. Some are young as he is. Others are much older. Jim constantly thinks of ""getting bare tit."" His brother Matt is three years older. He has dropped out of college and sometimes caddies as well. Matt's parents are upset with him for quitting school. Matt is staying in a rooming house. The book covers their adventures as well as a romance for each of the brothers. The time frame of the book is late 1960's during the Vietnam war. Ultimately Matt is drafted and sent overseas. He does not return. A good fast moving quick read."
1,"pictured, is the foot i ordered,but not the one that i recieved","the foot i recieved didn't have the three crimped metal slots like the one pictured. it was flat metal with 5 microscopic holes drilled straight down, not what i ordered at all. was very disappointed."
4,"Turn as the earth and moon turn, circling what they love","I just have bought this album, this was the first time for me to listen this band, I sometimes use to hear easy-listening music before going to sleep, and this album has a mix of that and also relaxing, charming voices and choruses. I really don't know where is the band from, but they're amazing. One of my favourite song is Er A La Vo (Sicily), despite all songs are very nice. Some songs are played with a smooth backgroung music like guitars, flutes, harps... and some others just a capella, with no background music.My personal songs rate could be 10/101. Whatever circles comes from the center 6/102. Dark of the Moon 8/103. Oh Mama Bakudala 8/104. Summer Solstice 8/105. I Have A Million Nightingales 7/106. Bim Bam 7/107. Learned of Angel 8/108.

4,"It Works, but...","It works but can be a bit messy during clean up. It does make excellent chicken or tuna salad, however the blades sit so low that onions and other veggies are slung out of the way (upward) before being fully shredded. I wonder why they don't put a set of blades all along the shaft of the cup? I also wonder why things can't fit together without gaping holes, but I guess that's what makes us human."
2,Very disappointing,"I was so excited at the prospect of having a 3-cup mini chopper. I thought it would be ideal for hummus, which I hate to scrape out of my blender. However, it was very disappointing. On either speed, it just seems to chop what is in the center, so the stuff on the inside stays on the inside and the outside stuff stays on the outside--unchopped. If I wanted to take the lid off every two seconds and move everything around, I'd use the blender, no? I nearly pureed some red pepper, trying to get it all chopped. I have a 2 cup mini chopper (Procter-Silex, I think) that is really much better at consistent chopping. I never had to take the top off of it. Unfortunately, the bowl got warped in the dishwasher (even though it claimed to be dishwasher safe) and the lid does not fit tightly now, making an occasional mess with liquids and crumbs. Still, even warped, I find myself using the old one instead of this new one--it is really that bad!!"
3,Is it worth the price?,"Within three months of receiving this item (as a wedding present)one of the hinges on the lid fell off. The unit still functions properly, but I would think twice before spending [the money]."
3,Great for small jobs only,"This food processor is tiny and is great for chopping veggies and mincing garlic. The blades attachment, however, did cause a small leak when blending liquids. Also, you can't leave it running for more than a few seconds, because the motor starts to emit a burning sound.Overall, good for quick kitchen jobs and it's a bargain...I mean, those manual Zyliss food choppers cost that much."
1,Awful,"This couldn't even handle chopping a 1/4 of an onion that had already been roughly chopped.I have a mini processor attachment for my blender, and while it doesn't hold much, it's way more powerful. This is sitting in a box in the basement, where it's been for 2 years... and where it'll stay."
1,The worst food processor ever,"This chopper, if you can call it that, is terrible. I've tried chopping all kinds of foods from veggies to fruit to nuts to cheese. I've tried filling up the bowl, half full and barely anything at all. It doesn't chop. Plain and simple it just doesn't chop the food. I've had pieces of vegetables get stuck on the blade. Then, I'd have to stop and remove the piece and try again. It started to chop a little a couple of times, but then just stopped and the blade kept spinning while chopping nothing.It was horrible and I've opted now for a bigger 7 cup Kitchen Aid or Cuisinart processor based on reviews here.Lesson learned, you get what you pay for."
2,Strange Indeed,"I really wanted to get back into the awesome alterna-pop groove Relocation had me bopping my head too. The clear and emotional singing that sprung out from behind the guitars. This album seemed to have lost everything I loved about Relocation. The melodies aren't so bad, but the singing has really gotten lost in the music. The lead singer sounds weak and muffled, the songs don't stand out. Its not like Relocation, but its not even a more masterful successor to Relocation. Its just sorta somewhere and nowhere at the same time. I was truly dissapointed, and don't think this album is worth really owning unless you can get into this, but there are other bands that have succeeded where Strange Exchange failed. (Fono, Bleach, Relient K) PlankEye has truly gone a different way with this album, different is good, but not when others have done it better.Sorry guys."
1,Quality Not as Good as Other NEST Movies,"This particular product does not have the same quality of the other NEST movies such as the Good Samaritan, The King is Born, etc. The animation is horrendous and looks rushed. The voice acting isn't that much greater. Its only strong point is the fact that it illustrates Jesus' parables, and even then I think you're better off reading them from the Holy Bible.Now, about NEST DVDs altogether: if you are considering purchasing the DVDs in order to modernize your collection from VHS, you should be aware that the NEST DVDs are altered from their original versions. Some lines have been taken out or changed altogether. I know because I had all the VHS tapes memorized, even down to the duplication warning at the beginning of each video."
5,Larry,Book is worth the time to read. It gives a new understanding to the relationship between man and dog. I will reread this book several times as I am sure I missed some of the wisdom Dr. Coppinger shares.
5,MUST READ FOR ANYONE INTERESTED IN CANID BEHAVIOR,"i HAVE BEEN WORKING IN THE FIELD OF THE BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY OF THE CANIDS SINCE THE EARLY SEVENTIES AND QUITE FRANKLY THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS TO COME OUT IN RECENT YEARS! I PUT IT IN THE SAME CATAGORY AS FOX'S BOOK ""THE BEHAVIOR OF WOLVES, DOGS AND RELATED CANIDS"" , SCOTT AND FULLER'S BOOK ""DOG BEHAVIOR THE GENETIC BASIS"" AND OF COURSE ""THE INTEGRATED DEVELOPMENT OF BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR IN THE CANIDS"". iT IS A SIMPLY SPECTACULAR READ!"
4,The Desert and Two Stones,"This is a different kind of story. Unlike the typical that follows a character from start to finish, this follows different people. It tells of their experiences and encounters. Very interesting book"
4,Everyone can find something interesting in this book,"This is the first volume in a collection of books on design criticism. The articles are pulled from sources like the Journal of the AIGA, Print, and EYE magazine. The topics range the ""ugly aesthetic"" to the state of design education. The articles are all decent none really stick out as undeserving of a place in this collection. Paul (IBM logo) Rand Contributes an interesting essay on what purpose logos really serve and Paula Scher talks about the way she runs her classes at SVA. The essays all provide some food for thought(even it the thought is "" I'd like to smack this guy."")Buy it and keep it with you It's a good thing to have around while your waiting for a bus, a haircut, or a class to begin."
5,Powerfull Mixer,"This is a great appliance, with a powerfull motor to work any kind of mix,and includes an Boost button to increase power in hard works.It come's with platform,and turntable for automatic operation,and it's detachable for manual work, and you can forget the sprinkles,becasue with the detachable mixing shield you can now finish your mix with a clean table and wears. If you want an non-expensive appliance,with great power and good look for your kitchen,ressistant,and with glass bowl,and two pairs of beaters, then buy this mixer.I recommend it."
3,Minor Calexico,"I always thought I liked this album, and probably still have a soft spot for it, but sitting down to listen to it end to end I kind of got bored. Still, this band does sport a woozy, strung-out sound that is engaging, and some of the songs, notably ""Waiting for Food"" and ""Liquored (in the Baker)"" are excellent. But other pieces are either brief to the point of total unmemorability, or a little too consciously ""cinematic"" to really work on record. I don't know, they are kind of like Norfolk and Western, another rural slowish-core act, you admire the ethic, you want to get behind the result, but the whole leaves a little something to be desired. If you like Calexico, give Tracker a try."
4,Good what it's for,"Don't expect this subwoofer to absolutely blow anything away, but that's because that's not what it's designed for. I use it with my YSP800 unit, and it works just fine. Not too loud, but the base is deep enough to be sufficient for my tiny combines of a living room. Bottom line, if you're an audiophile this is NOT a unit for you, obviously. If you're just a regular 'joe the plumber' and looking for a sleek looking, great sounding woofer, then this one is perfect."
5,YST-FSW100 Subwoofer,"This product mates perfectly with my ysp800 sound projector (& Sceptre 37"" LCD). Together with my aging desktop and some wireless stuff, I have a small footprint system that does almost everything. The sound is great, so TV, DVDs, and 'net music services all tickle my ears."
5,Good pliers,"Very well made little pliers, very handy to carry in your pocket, saves fingers, farmers say they will cut baling wire with ease."
1,I paid $19.99 for this????!!!!!!,"""Leatherette"" doesn't even begin to describe it. Cheaply made with cheap low quality materials - as they say: You Get What You Pay For (in this particular case I paid way too much) - This case looks cheap and feels cheap. Like something you would probably find at a Flea Market. Not good quality at all. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY like I did. Terrible product."
2,Yawn,"I picked this up for my Kindle when it was free. I'm glad I didn't actually buy it.I'm not entirely sure what the significance was of the first trial in the book, the one about the SEAL supposidly raping the officer, other than maybe to set the tension between the two navy lawyers. The second trial and seemly the main reason for the book began almost as the book was to end. The story of that trial was told from the point of view of the news media, and came across like listening to a baseball game on the radio. I found it hollow. I found myself skimming those parts just to get done.I'm glad many folks enjoyed it, but it wasn't my cup of tea."
4,Looking forward to the next book in the series!,Treason... A great read if you were a fan of that TV show JAG (which I was). Only this story line is more realistic and an eye opener to the possibilities that could happen in the near future. Women will also like the subtle romantic twist which is not too gushy for the guys. Lots of action and details. I'm looking forward to reading the next one. Hostage.
1,"Preachy, predictable, terrible - 3 hours I will never get back!","I agree with the one star reviewers.Preachy, Predictable, TERRIBLE writing, - just disgusting really. I too kept reading because I couldn't believe that this bad a book would have gotten good reviews! That by itself is troubling, and may well keep me awake at night. I immediately deleted all other Don Brown books from my kindle - quick before they spoil the other books!Don't waste your time on this book. Truly worthless."
3,A nice beach read,"This was the first Kindle book I read, because it was offered for free. I also took it because I thought it was written by the ""other"" Mr. Brown (of DaVinci Code fame). It is a good read for the beach or on a trip as a mindless diversion. I didn't mind that it is from a ""Christian"" author (although the final scene is a bit much). An okay read, but only if the book is priced at $2.99 or less, whether Kindle or paperback."
1,"drivel, with a religious agenda","Treason starts out OK, although with somewhat stilted prose, but it quickly becomes awful. I tried to finish it, and got nearly two-thirds of the way through it, but finally gave up and deleted it from my Kindle. I'm sure a good writer could fuse Christian proselytizing with an action thriller, but Don Brown clearly cannot; this is neither thrilling nor convincing. He might make an effective preacher, but he's a poor writer."
2,Average at best,"If you love Grisham, don't bother with Brown. The premise of the book could be good, but it is overly simplistic in its execution. No shocking revelations in the courtroom or clever legal manouvers. The allegedly brilliant defense attorney comes up with an unimaginative defense and our ""hero"" is equally underwhelming in court. Furthermore, the ""good"" vs. ""evil"" dichotomy is so lacking in complexity that it becomes almost laughable."
4,Don't Be Turned Off by the Christian Stuff,"I downloaded this book because it was free for Kindle; I am not generally a fan of Christian lit. But I promise you, only about 5% of the book was about lovin' the lord. The book is very suspenseful and a pleasure to read. The character relationships are somewhat awkward (prude), but there is no preaching against pre-marital sex or randiness in general. The quality of writing isn't the best, and at times, it reads very much like a first novel, but the interesting story makes up for it. In fact, I liked it so much that I am (gasp) considering PAYING for the next three books in the series. I would say give this book a try if it's still free. It's a really easy read (something like 68 VERY short chapters), and, again, the prosthelytizing is really negligible."
1,Beware: this book is nothing more than christian propaganda.,This might have been a decent read if it didn't turn out to be a christian indoctrination scam. Don't waste your time or money on this book unless you already dislike Islam and are only interested in reading stories that try to elevate christianity above all other religions. Pathetic...
1,Thinly veiled Christian Propoganda,"While there is some interesting storyline and action in this book, it reads to me like a thinly veiled attempt to denigrate non-Christians especially people of the Islamic faith. This book is nothing more than a poor attempt to write a story espousing the ""superiority"" of the Christian faith disguised as a ""military Thriller"". Don't fall for it, this book is NOT worth the time or the money. You could get the same message from any right-wing pundit on Fox News."
1,Started out interesting...,"But sadly the very biased religious theme kept getting heavier until about a third of the way in I had to quit reading. It's a shame, because other than the fact that I felt I was being preached to the story was reasonably entertaining. Not sure if I will read any more Don Brown after this."
2,"no suspense, no surprises","The plot of this novel is transparent from the beginning. Don't expect any surprising plot twists, because there are none.The conversion to Kindle format is troubled when it comes to names. Hyphens or zeros are sometimes added or removed from names. Paragraphs that start with dialog sometimes have the dialog repeated."
2,"bounce, bounce","The author is clearly inspired and all that inspiration comes out in the form of a hodgepodge of characters and plot threads. I simply couldn't keep things straight and didn't finish the book.A good premise, but just too jumbled. A good editing would help this book enormously."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"Really, quite shocking to me that this book has a 4.5 star rating. I glanced at a few reviews, saw they were okay, and figured I would give it a go for free. Let me be clear, this is a mediocre book at best, predictable in it's plot development and weak in it's development of characters. Perhaps most importantly, it's real purpose to espouse the benefits of a Christian life and faith. It's free, so giving it one star would be a bit harsh, but go in with your eyes wide open."
4,Excellent series,"I went into these with lukewarm expectations and was pleasantly surprised. Don Brown definitely has writing talent and knows how to tell a good story. I sat down on read the whole trilogy in one weekend, when I should have been doing other things, so he certainly held my interest. I thought the author did a great job of inserting a Christian message without making this a preachy book. And the storyline was great. Can't wait to read more of his stuff.I gave it four stars instead of five because I thought there were some unresolved story lines. The main character spent a lot of time wondering why the rape victim was acting so odd and wondering about the truth but once the trial was over, seemed to forget out it and the author never brought it up again. I really felt like there was a build up to something there but the story just left us hanging."
1,Cliches and stereotypes,"0ne of the worst books I have ever forced myself to finish. Buyer beware: at free, this book is overpriced; it is not worth the expense of the hours of your life you will spend trudging through it. Repetitive and predictable, it features a relentless march of stock characters who represent the worst attitudes of the extreme Christian right. Muslims bad, Jews greedy, Christians radiant and pure (and praying every time they turn around). Politics are explored as well: Democrats are corrupt and self~serving; Republicans are selfless and brave. Always. This book has the depth of a piece of paper and almost no perceivable plot. Avoid at any cost."
2,"MJ, San Diego",Disappointed The story was filled with Christian bias. A female attorney cannot possibly win against the strong brilliant CHRISTIAN male. Homosexuals force themselves on shipmates so they are unft so serve in the miltary. I delted this book and the other books I bought by this author. Self rightous bigotry. This guy gives religion a bad name
1,"Not worth ""free.""","I ""bought"" this book when it was offered free but did not read it until a few days ago. It was very disappointing.I knew that it was a Christian book, but did not expect the heavy propaganda it included. I came away from it thinking that the point of the story was to incite anger against terrorists. (BTW, I am not Muslim nor do I agree with their beliefs.)The story lines were incomplete and left me feeling as if I had read only half the book. There was a lot thrown into the story without explanation or delineation of character or its development. Certainly, I shall not waste my time with any other books in this series or by this author."
1,Stay away if you don't like Christian Fiction,"I suppose the 1 star is a bit unfair because if you like Christian Fiction then this might appeal to you. For me, however, it is not to my taste and the problem is that I did not realize the religious influence until over halfway through the book. Even without the Christian preaching it would still have been a bad book."
5,Wow. Excellent Book,Great story line. Very relevant to today's news. Well written. Excited to read more from this author.
2,Well-written bigotry,"Good characters, suspense, intrigue and action but the dialogue was very wooden and unrealistic. More importantly, however, was the bigoted portrayal of Arabs and fear/hate-based oversimplification of Muslims as extremists and terrorists. So stilted and uncomfortably anti-Muslim as to be difficult to read at times. With the military base setting and background, the added ""Muslims are anti-USA"" message resounded painfully. Haven't seen such propaganda since the Bush administration."
2,Shallow and Predictable,"Don't waste your time on this one. The characters are shallow, the dialogue and plot predictable. If I had not been limited to this book on a weekend retreat, i would never have finished it. Mr Brown takes the serious issue of national security and tries to disguise his paranoid/racist biases under the cloak of Christianity and the ""one true religion"".Save your time and money."
5,Court-room Drama,"This was my first Don Brown book and my first court-room drama, but I will come back for more. Don Brown weaves a tale of intrigue and suspense. He broaches the subject of terrorism well, and even though he doesn't worry about whether or not his books are realistic on how the government and how terrorism rings work, but you believe it every step of the way. His military experience helps in his depiction of the US Navy, JAGs, and such.I really look forward to more that Don Brown writes and will be looking more of his books in the Kindle store."
1,treason,"Very disappointing. A poor imitation of John Grisham, but without his drama, suspense and courtroom logic. The goody characters were too good and did not have any faults that would make them more human. Plot was easy to follow and was predictable in its outcome."
1,So Utterly Disappointing,"I think, that when a book, be any book at that, but a fiction suspense one all the more, should be stretching your mind and dare you wrongly guess at things to come.But this book is a far cry from that.So expected, so similar to what we have read so many timesNot worth the $2 cost"
2,Just read the New Testament,"Not a bad story, but Brown's evangelization keeps getting in the way. ""He could tell she was a Christian from the gentle way she treated people."". (paraphrased). Bla bla bla."
2,Great Plot poorly written,"I loved the plot I hated the drawn out over use of obviously superlative adjectives and extra long Naval abbreviations.Because this was known to be a ""religious"" book I just skipped over the preachiest parts but at times they did tend to annoy. But Hey for free you can't do much better with current fiction.I will probably get another sometime but not for a while."
3,"not Clancy, Grisham, etc.","Certainly Treason's plot is timely and for those of us who like shows like JAG and NCIS it has its interesting points. I can believe that the author is very familiar with how the military and JAG works. However, the characters don't have the the depth that some other successful writers of the genre provide. Although most of the reviews and descriptions don't reveal it, there is a definite ""Christian romance"" angle to this story that will not appeal to all. The villains (Muslims) are stereotyped: if you like your good guys and bad guys as clearcut this book provides that. I ""bought"" this as a freebie on Kindle along with 3 others by Brown, but probably won't bother to read the remaining books."
5,A MUST READ!,"Hands down, this is one of the best series I have ever read, and I read a LOT of books. All three of these book were top notch. Action, Suspense, Christian. I don't want to give away any of the plot. Just read it!"
1,"Religious - yes, Christian - no","I had downloaded all of the Navy Justice series. In the first book, I was very uncomfortable with the author's portrayal of Muslims as a cult and fanatics. I understand that Muslim fringe terrorists provide an easy target these days, but not everyone in the relgion is evil or bad.The book never did anything to dispell these innaccuracies - even pontificating about whether or not Palestine should be a state into the mix.I started on book 2 as well to see if it would improve. Within the first page, the Muslim terrorism started up again. I could read no further.While the first book does have some interesting points about how the naval justice system works, the plot is muddled and weak. The first case, about a rape, is never fully resolved. His portrayal of the lead female character is wishy-washy at best.This was not a good book, and the stereotypical, overbroad characterizations left little to be desired."
1,In the end just boring,"I tried to ignore the author's preachy dialog and simplistic, black and white conservative worldview but ultimately the worst part of this book is that there is no drama. It is boring, which is a cardinal sin in a ""courtroom thriller"". I got free downloads of all the Don Brown books for Kindle, read this one and deleted the rest--it is that bad."
2,smoke and mirrors,"This book combines a hot topic,the islamic jihad,against the USA with a heavy dose of antisematism,anti-islam and outright christian proselytizing. The court action was ok but really a magicians trick to distract from the books basic message give yourself to Jesus. This book is best filed in the religious section."
2,preachy and simplistic,"This book seemed to have such promise initially. The plot set up and characters could have gone in so many interesting and thought-provoking directions.Unfortunately, the characters never rise above caricatures, the plot never goes off in directions that will challenge or surprise the reader, and the book just increasingly feels like a heavy-handed mouthpiece for really simplistic views about the world.Someone who faithfully and unquestioningly watches fox news or listens to conservative talk radio will, however, likely love this book."
1,Boring! You've Been Warned,I thought this was going to be another great book by Dan Brown. I am 1/3 of the way through it right now and won't be spending another minute on it. Incredible waste of time. It just yarns on and on. Didn't any one mention to Dan Brown that his book was boring before he had this piece of crap published? I can't believe I had to pay for this turkey. I will never purchase another Dan Brown book. I warned you!
2,Where are the details?,I soo enjoyed his otter book and was looking forward to this one. Talk about disappointing! The book lacked detail and fel liken indoctrination in Christianity
2,Disappointing New Series,"Don Brown's ""Treason"", the debut book in a new series, and for a change the JAG TV show is better than the book, which isn't a recommendation; nothing original or imaginative in the ""fill in the blanks"" style writing; caricature characters, and a plot that should have been interesting because the basic idea makes sense, but limps along; the average reader knows whats going to happen after the first 25 pages, very disappointing overall; I hope the following books are better written but this first one was so bad I won't be reading any further"
2,Unreadable,Readers beware...the author is a zealot in whose world everything is black and white. Christians good ...Muslims all dangerous extreamists. athe United States always good...the rest of the world either a drooling ally or an enemy.The story actually was not bad until his religious views became overbearing.This one iis for the right wing only...discerning readers need not apply.
2,Not Great,"I downloaded this book when it was free and I'm glad I didn't pay for it. While portions of the book are okay and written well (the actions of the terrorists and their advisors), much of the significant portions are not. The animosity/attraction between the main characters is touched upon continually but I never felt that it was properly explored, at least it hadn't been by the 60% mark of the book where I stopped reading. On the other hand, parts of the book that are of no importance to the plot or its development are presented in unnecessary detail. I found myself skipping sections because I just didn't care or felt it didn't matter to the story. I finally stopped reading when I could no longer believe that decisions at the highest level of this country were being made in the manner being presented. I have downloaded three of this author's other books and may actually try them, but this was one just frustrated me too much."
1,This is the ending???,"The plot grabbed me but the ending was a serious disappointment. Brown left major elements unresolved. It actually made me angry.The protagonists are in the JAG Corps and profess to be principled and hold Justice dear, but the conclusion of the novel is totally inconsistent with this theme.The other theme of Christianity woven here and there in the story seems out of place, just inappropriate.I'm only happy that my copy is a library book so I can return it. This one doesn't belong in MY library."
2,Treason,The sudden and truncated ending leaves two of the book's story lines inexplicably up in the air; an implausable ending. Seems like the author just ran out of time and space and desperately tried to wrap it up in a couple of short paragraphs. An otherwise good read is butchered at the end.
4,I liked it,"I liked this book. It was a quick read for me, but I am pleased with it. I plan on reading more by this author. I think the difficult decisions and risks taken, the temptation of fame and fortune work. I hope Brown's other books are about these characters."
3,"good read, but...","The book started out great! But when the case representing the title began, I felt that the author was running out of pages or time and left out all of the details. I was disappointed with the last quarter of the book."
5,My Favorite Author!,"Treason is a book that once you begin reading, you do not want to stop. Can't wait to find out what happens next. I hear the next one, Hostage is better, but I cannot immagine another better! Maybe as great as this one!"
4,I love finding new talented authors!,"Treason was a pleasant surprise! The book is well written and keeps your attention. To be honest, I was not sure whether to rate it three or four stars. Treason will keep your attention, but there are so many little plots and points of view that it can get confusing to figure out why they are there--and in some cases you basically come away not knowing why. There is also a tendency by the author to short change some of the action. For instance there is a trial for a rape victim. The trial could have been much tenser and more interesting; yet the author chose to keep it short to advance the characters involved in another plot twist.I will continue to read the series and hope that some of the unnecessary verbiage is taken out or tightened up. Worth the effort."
5,Stunning music with a bargain price,"Well remastered and from the master at or near his peak, this CD is not to be missed if you are a fan of Mr Jamal. With Mr Crawford in exemplary form - he went on to play with Mr Gil Evans on one of the greatest pieces of music this side of Jupiter - OUT OF THE COOL - as well as Mr Israel Crosby - what ARE you waiting for!! MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC"
3,Okay,This movie is okay. My son is almost 4 and I thought he would like it because he is really into super heroes.. but it's a little too old for him. I do think he will love it when he's a few years older.
1,DON'T BUY THIS DVD!!!,"It's an understatement that many of us feel ripped off by WB's attempt to unfairly empty our wallets. If we refuse to buy these horribly priced episode dvds and at the same time purchase the available box sets that are of value then we can make some headway. They are in the business of making $$$. Slowing their cash flow will force them to give us consumers' products we demand or risk losing our disposable income. Die-hard fans of this series and other series must convince every parent to withhold from purchasing these dvds until full seasons are made available. C'mon WB, we love these shows and will pay for them. We only ask that you don't rape our wallets. Give us the box sets much sooner."
5,The BEST of the entire series!,"Without a doubt the BEST JL EVER!! The fights, the script and the tragedy of the Green Lantern and Hawk Girl romance--excellent. Not to give away too many spoilers, but the revealing of secret identities in this was amusing and thoroughly enjoyable. Can you say sleep over at Wayne Manor?I definitely look forward to the new season and would APPRECIATE IT IF WARNER BROS WOULD HURRY UP AND PUT OUT SEASONS 1 AND 2 ON DVD!! Thank you.Great job, Bruce Timm!"
5,Star Crossed,"WOW!!!This movie has everything. I enjoyed this movie alot.It shows a side of the Justice League thats, well human.Hopefully you guys will know what I am talking about after you see the movie. It has suspence, action, its just an all around good movie."
1,Buy the real thing on June 20,On June 20 Justice League the complete second season will be availible on DVD. It will include the three episodes on this disc in anamorphic widescreen plus 23 more all at 5x the price value. While these episodes are great I can't possibly recommend this when we will be able to buy full season sets in such a short period of time. While this disc is the best of Warners single disc Justice League sets it contains some extras and a widescreen version (somethings the creaters have been fighting for) it can't possibly compare to real boxed sets of the whole season.
4,Excellent - well worth it,This was one really awesome movie. The character relationships were realistic and well done. The plot was brilliant. It really wasn't as predictable as you may also think as there are a number of plot twists. There are also well done sub-plots as the conflicts with Hawk Girl and the rest of the JL particularly wtih Green Lantern.
2,Didnot get product i ordered,I ordered the review product but got another product instead and consequently cannot comment.Horatio Dias
4,I like My HIME more,"This is a good anime and if you like My HIME you should watch this. I warn you...""SPOILER"" kinda... Just read it, I masked the spoiler.The story issues love between a grown man and two young girls... Too much love for girls that young. It was kinda disturbing, and allot of the story focused on that, making it kinda awkward.After that weather that bothers you or not, seeing characters from My HIME are really cool. Its the best thing bout this anime by far. Allot of the My HIME cast is scattered about this whole anime and play different roles. Finding out who and what they are is awesome.Buy it. It's fun, if you seen My HIME."
1,Garbage,Literally. It went in the trash after I tried using this 3 in 1 tool.The directions for switching out the tools seemed to be translated from German into Greek back into German and then into English. The tools did not switch out easily and their placement was awkward.The blade on the shaver was so dull that it did absolutely nothing no matter how much pressure I applied.I had thought buying an item from a trusted brand like Tweezerman would be a no brainer. I was wrong.
4,Great GitFiddle 4 Da $$$$$$,"First Act makes some great little axes. Don't get the wrong idea; these are not toys. They're nice playing, well-built guitars. You might need to have it ""set-up"" by someone who knows how to do it when you first recieve it (I know you're saying ""what? It's brand new. Why do I need a set-up?). That's just how it is when your dealing with a guitar that has been mass-produced. I got mine used and after about 20 minutes I had her set-up and rocking! I've been playing guitar for 20+ years and I firmly believe that you don't have to spend $1000 to get a great guitar. These First Act guitars are good instruments for the $$$$. In addition, they provide a solid foundation upon which you can build (i.e. upgrade hardware etc.). I'm impressed with them. I also predict that in the future they will be sought after little axes (kind of like the old Silvertone or Teisco guitars from the 60s and 70s). Get one and start jammin' out!"
4,Lee Later,"One of the greatest and most underated jazz singers, Lee Wiley is presented on this CD as an older, more mature singer. Perhaps there is not the same verve or timbre in her voice, but her great timing and feel for the song is evident. Track 3 and track 19 are worth the price of this CD, alone. On the first, she sings a song that should be a classic melody: ""You're Lucky To Me"". But this version is a slower pace than she usually sang, such as with Eddie Condon's groups at the Town Hall Jazz Concerts in 1944. It has a memorable flavor. On track 19, which is one of the unique cuts on this CD which leave in re-takes and comments on some recordings, and Lee, who had been very ill and passed away a few years later, can be heard saying that she didn't like singing it because it depressed her. This is not only good music, it is history. There have been many imitators of Lee, but none did it quite like she did."
4,Great.....BUT......,"Yes,this set has all sorts of crazy ,cut-up,mix sequences and wild ideas galore! It is a landslide of madness and imagination......incredible stuff. Almost an overdose of sounds.BUT ,when I first got the album of CDs ,.....my one CD player had a very hard time reading disc #2. You see in all the lust for an ""art piece"" the disc is made to start playing at something like track #50,and carry on from that number to ""blow your mind"" ,I'd guess, in an arty fashion. Sadly,some disc players refuse to start at such a high number and just sit there ""hung-up"" and computer stunned(I'd like to call it).I'd guess it blew more CD players minds? So,you just might not be able to play disc 2 in this set......or maybe you might? You have a better chance at it if you have a few players,and can give it a try in a bunch of 'em. Barring that ""art"" disaster.....this is a fine set of sounds from a master."
5,Many tiny explosions between your ears,"Go ahead, life is short, buy it. Also buy ""Grayfolded"", which I have never gotten tired of after dozens (okay, maybe not a lot of dozens) of listens."
4,interesting,"this book is interesting when you know the mindmap technique. the issues raised and questions given to assess different situations are valuable and practical indeed, whether you are a CEO,a jobhunter or teammember. Mindmapping stays a tool, it doesn't replace the essentail questions."
5,The Best Of Unsolved Mysteries,"If you like the show ""Unsolved Mysteries"" and don't have any of them then it's a no brainer.I enjoy this collection and rate it highly.""The Knuckler"""
4,LOVE IT,"I used to watch this show on tv a lot, and it really brings back nostalgia. I did love all the episodes in this pack, although in general it did feel pretty short. Would be great if they had the mega bundle for blu-ray."
5,Fabulous guitar,This was the perfect guitar for my nine-year-old daughter. It's the perfect size and the sound is amazing. All of the girls just stare at it when she walks into her music lessons.
5,I loved it!,"Lukan is one of the most intriquing novels I have ever read. The characters are well developed and interesting. The romance is sweetly delightful, and anyone looking for real heroes surviving human struggle and emotion, this book is a must read. I could not put it down."
1,"I was fooled, too.","This book may be a very good study guide, however it would be lovely of Amazon to tell you that it is a STUDY GUIDE for the FOURTH edition of this text! Don't be drawn in by the low prices! The real text (6th ed) is going to set you back at least $60!"
1,Problem solutions book,This is not a book. It's a whole list of solutions for problems included in another (unaffordable) book.When I received this (very late) shipment I felt deceived and very upset. Avoid this feelings not buying this item.
2,Study Guide,This book is a study guide not a text book or any other type of self improvment book. It is a companion book. This book accompanied with the text book make a great learning tool.
4,Just what we wanted ... almost.,"When we ordered the clothesline pole, it was clear that the clothesline itself didn't come with it. But we were surprised to learn that the bracket that the clothesline handle hooks to isn't included either. When we called to ask what happened, we learned that the bracket was sold separately. Not a particularly big deal, but the vendor should improve marketing materials to better explain exactly what you get. The picture shown suggested that there were two pieces which had to be purchased separately; actually there are three."
5,drying power,This is the second clothes line and post like this I've purchased. It does a great job and it hides away when not in use. The retractable mechanism has never failed. The pole is very sturdy and easy to install and great that it comes in three pieces.
4,Clothesline pole works well,It works well. You have to make sure you look for the bracket in the packing materials for the clothesline itself.
4,fairly well made,"I had my husband install this and it is well made. Our only complaint is because the T pole is 3 metal pieces that you connect together, the pole tends to bend when you attach the dryer rack to it and have laundry hanging on it. We plan on maybe soldering them together so that it stand straighter and will not bend. Otherwise, I really love it and it holds loads of clothes. I have been through many versions of outdoor drying racks and this has been my favorite. Fairly well made for such a good price."
3,Clothes line post,The lines seem to stretch out too much. My husband has to reset them for me almost every time I do clostes
4,Great for the husband to help feed the family,"We are expecting our third child in four years and I purchased this machine to help my husband cook meals for our ever-increasingly picky four year old's eating style. It's easy for my husband to use and always a surprise for our four year old to see what is in his ""pocket"" sandwich. Great investment and easy to clean as long as you don't over-fill the sandwich. We've made almost every combination you can think of including dessert pockets. Our four year old gives it four stars!"
2,OK.,This product did a fine job until the handle snapped during use. Not sure why. still using it as it works and to lazy to return but should be made more sturdy.
2,Cooks Fine- Terrible to Clean,"This product is good for quickly toasting quesadillas, sandwiches, etc. I like the way it pinch's the edges. The description says, ""Easy clean up."" It is woefully incorrect. If absolutely anything melts off the edge into the back hinge area, it is a battle to get a rag in it to clean it out. The plates are not removable either so trying to clean them while using just a wet rag is difficult, especially trying to cleanse them of the soap with just a rag, no running water. We got this for our wedding, I would never buy it for myself or anyone again."
4,Nice Gift,"I brought this for my daughter for the holidays last year. From what she tells me, it a snap making hot sandwiches. I'd fully recommend buying."
3,Difficult cleanup,"I love grilled cheese and mini taco's of leftovers inside corn tortillas. But now, I use my George Foreman grill instead because:1. Steam gets trapped and makes some sandwiches soggy.2. I like the grill marks better on the GF grill.3. Cleanup is a disaster if the filling spills over.4. The non stick coating is fragile."
5,WOW!,"it is an amazing toaster with which i can try a varity of sandwiches.. It takes very less time..and even though u dont use oil or butter, the bread doesnt get stick to it ..worth buying for its price"
1,bad plastic handle,I got this product from amazon because it looked similar to my old black & decker sandwich maker. To my surprise proctor and silex 25400 model the body is made of brittle plastic. The bottom part of handle broke from both front corners when I closed the lid while trying to use it for the first time.Let me tell u I used black and decker for years but its parts were made of metal i believe and it never broke regardless of how stuffy is sandwich.this is piece of junk!!. Returned it back to amazon.
4,Works as Advertised,"On the first try, I made a grilled cheese sandwich (which is why I bought it), and it worked great. Didn't burn, browned evenly, easy to get out, and easy cleanup.It performs as promised."
1,IMPROVEMENT????,"Purchased this item after the one I had for years hit the floor and shattered. Really didn't spend much time reading the description since it appeared the same but unfortunately it had been ""improved""......... the previously flat plates had been replaced with plates containing raised diagonal sections for what should precut your toasted sandwich. They don't......... and to make matters worse you cannot use anything other than conventional square, flat bread unless you want it mutilated......try using a hotdog roll. Seriously people.....when did cutting a sandwich become difficult???? I suggest that if we get to a point that we cannot slice a hot sandwich, then we probably shouldn't be using any appliance anywhere!! As a side note, I do not like diagonal cuts on a sandwich so let me choose!! Anyhow, found another toaster that cost more but it is worth the extra money to have completely flat plates."
2,i got what i paid for,"It worked, was cheap and arrived in time but the handle broke at the 4th or 5th sandwich..."
4,Wonderful and inexpensive,This product was a perfect gift for my sister. Once she opened it she automatically loved it. She hasn't stopped using it since I gave to her.
3,pretty cool,"It was pretty good had a lot of nice poems, but Hungarian is a very hard language to translate. I wasn't very happy with how they translated some things, it could have been done better. Over all if you don't know Hungarain this books isn't all that great."
4,Challenging puzzle,Bought this for my 4 year old who is very good at puzzles. This one is a challenge for him. The pieces are a little light so we've had one piece get a little bent. The pieces fit together fairly nicely and into the board. The colors and pictures are very good quality.
1,UGH,"I got online specifically to write a review for this puzzle. This is the worst puzzle. It's hard to get the pieces apart, but worst of all is that the pieces are so similar that they will fit in places they are not suppose to go. And then you have to try and get them apart, ugh. I do not recommend. And I hope my Mother-in-Law did not pay Melissa and Doug's usual prices."
5,Such a great puzzle,"My daughter is a huge puzzle lover. She has mastered the simple puzzles so I picked this one up for her since it has more pieces. First, I absolutely love that this puzzle is wood. It easily holds up to the use of the five children in our household. The pieces are all cut perfectly and we have no issues with them not fitting together. Second, the quality of Melissa and Doug products are fantastic and this puzzle isn't any different. It's a great buy, not only because of the quality but because of the price."
5,Rainforest Puzzle,I love M&D puzzles. They are very durable and provides of fun and entertainment for little ones.
5,Grandson's favorite puzzle,"Melissa & Doug make the best puzzles for the little ones. They are durable, colorful and have a nice board to put the puzzle together on. Our grandson is almost 3 years old, and loves to put this puzzle together."
5,Puzzles,This puzzle was chosen by me for our 19 month grandchild in Turkey. I have not seen it. The parents tell me that he loves to put the puzzle together.
3,Just OK,"I bought this for my son's 3rd Birthday. He loves puzzles and I have been so happy with all of the other Melissa and Doug products we have got in the past. While my son Loves this puzzle I have been very unhappy.1. When we first opened the puzzle it was almost stuck and to almost break the pieces to get them to come undone.2. Piece have already started to bend and break(had this for less then a month).3. Piece are very hard to piece together. My son can sometime not get pieces to go together do to them being to tightAs i said my son does love this puzzle, but i have not been as pleases as i would have hoped."
2,Not a long lasting puzzle,"I have preschool students who wanted harder puzzles. I ordered this one and was thrilled with the design UNTIL my first student tried to use it. I took the puzzle apart from the packaging to make sure that no pieces would be broken when separated for the first time. Student #1 put it together. Not an easy puzzle but perfectly challenging for him. When the second student tried to separate the pieces from each other, one piece splintered into layers. Another piece had 1/2 of the print splinter off the base.What happened to D & M's quality? I ordered 9 puzzles for my class, all D & M and now I think I should just return since they are such poor quality. Really disappointed and so are my students."
5,Excellent product. Buy it!,I love Melissan & Doug products! Extremely durable. Vibrant colors. Solid build. I loved it so much I bought 3 different ones. A much better investment than cardboard puzzles. Buy it!
5,Good learning tool,My daughter is 2 1/2 yrs old and loves these puzzles. She does them over and over again. The wood backed pieces make them more durable than cardboard puzzles - and they are great for spatial reasoning. The picture also gave us an opportunity to learn animals and colors.
3,Watch Out for Splinters!,"My grandson was almost 4 when he got this for Christmas. Beautiful and durable, but he got a splinter from it. I'd suggest you'd need to sand all the edges of each puzzle piece before allowing a child to play with it. I wouldn't have expected this to be necessary. I won't buy another from this company for this very reason.***Update: My grandson is almost six years old now and I have had to glue one of the pieces de-laminating. Otherwise it has held his interest for two years. I did hit all the pieces and the holder with sandpaper because of the rough splintering. Just can't recommend this because of the splinters!"
2,splints and peeled off top layer,"It is not easy to find 50 piece wooden jigsaw puzzle, and the picture is nice.BUT!!!This puzzle is made of thin plywood. The top veneer (printed picture) peels off when you try to separate two puzzle peaces. The plywood is obviously not compressed enough or just plain low quality.And many many splints!!!I have more than 15 wooden puzzles made in Europe or US, and they never had this kind of problem. I am very disappointed.I wouldn't buy anoter Melissa and Doug wooden puzzle. Their hardboard puzzles are ok, but Crocodile Creek puzzles are a lot better (more expensive though)."
2,This isn't Ivory,It's more like tan or beige. Really disappointing because I was/am looking for ivory in color...This same comment appears in other reviews but I just hadn't checked them!
4,Not bad,"I recently rediscovered the Shamen and figured I would pick up this CD: new = cool I thought. It's not a bad CD really, but it's not something you'll listen to over and over again, unlike Shamen's classic En-Tact -- note, if you happen to find the British version of En-Tact pick it up in addition to the US version, it has different mixes of the same songs. The only standout tracks to me on this CD are tracks 2, 9, and 11: the Boss Drum, Possible Worlds, and MK2A remixes. Tracks 4-7 are direct lifts from the US version of En-Tact, which means they're good but not new. The other songs aren't bad but it's taking too long for me to warm up to them."
5,absolutely brilliant... pure genius...,"its hard to believe Chris Spencer has been keeping Unsane going for just about 20 years now. they've put out some great slabs of bloody music over the past 2 decades, but I have to say, I think this one might be my favorite. the style of songs isn't that much different than 2005's Blood Run, but I think on Visqueen, the production is noticeably better. its louder, clearer, and more definted. also, the vocals have improved substantially. all summed up, I think this is overall a better bunch of songs and probably their strongest. HIGHLY recommended would be an understatement."
3,One step down,"I have always been a number one fan of UNSANE, true band, these kind of bands have dissapeared from the face of the earth. Anyway, I have all the records of course and I love them. However, Visqueen, is a step down for Chris, Dave and Vinny. It sounds almost like the Cutthroats 9 album on Man's Ruin records, and doesn't even come close to such great Unsane albums as ""Scattered..."", ""Occupational Hazard"" or ""Blood Run"". I am so sorry, but ""Visqueen"" is a dissapointment for me."
5,5 years old and going strong!,I have had mine for 5 years and I love it! It is easy to clean and cooks well. I have never had a problem with mine and I would purchase another in a heart beat! Will be giving one for a Christmas gift.
4,Greatest kitchen appliance,"I gave this skillet/griddle to my wife as a Christmas present in 2005 and we have used it almost daily since. It's great for pancakes, swedish meatballs, grilled cheese, french toast, sunny-side up eggs, hash browns, american fries, etc. Ours recently stopped working, but I suspect that has something to do w/ water getting into it. It's very easy to clean just use some wet & dry paper towels w/ a little dishsoap."
3,Hamilton Beach 38500 Step Savor Skillet/Griddle Combo,"I have had mine for a couple of years now. I've always used/liked it since it is convenient and easy to use and just the right size for two. I usually use it for stir frys and pancakes. Works great. However, just recently the coating on the pan has started to flake off rendering the pan pretty much useless to me now. I would like to find a replacement pan (without buying the whole unit again) but have yet to find one. So my advice is...if you want something that will only last a couple of years go for it. Otherwise don't bother."
1,Very Disappointed,"did the research, made the buy - very disappointed. Did not heat well, & died after three years of gentle limited use."
1,Can not Boil Water!,"I have picked up 3 of these and none of them got hot enough to boil water (212 degrees Farenheit), let alone fry something at 350 degrees. I literally tried 3 of them! It looks great, feels solid...but none of them worked...at all!"
3,Here's to a Great Buy.,I had been looking for a griddle and not only found a great griddle for making pancakes on but also a new electric skillet. I have used both the griddle and the skillet several times and with great success. The temperature gage is accurate and both of the parts are easy to clean. Also the storage rack is wonderful. Hope you enjoy this product.
1,I threw mine away,"I threw mine away because I could never get that new appliance plastic taste out of it. Everything I cooked tasted like plastic and went in the garbage. I tried everything to make the smell go away...finally, I gave up. Save your money"
2,I loved it but then,"I had been using it for french toast an a regular basis, but the first time I used it for something else the pan just kept getting hotter and hotter. It would not turn down. I unplugged it and it never heated up again."
5,Fashionable,I feel good about wearing this kind of lingerie dress because of the style.2PC Lace Trimmed Mesh Mini Dress Sexy Lingerie Intimate Apparel with Off the Shoulder Top and Bell Sleeves and G-String
5,Different,I came across this lingerie just browsing the site for something sexy for my significant other and I purchased it immediately. Very inexpensive and fits the way I wanted it to! I recommend this product to anyone who wants to tantalize that special someone!
2,Sizing way off,"This looks great on the model. If you are larger than a size 14 don't purchase this little dress. The sizing is way off. If this was actually a plus size it would be great. The material is nice and the price is right. It it fit, I would have given it 5 stars."
2,NOT for plus sized ladies!!!,"I read the other reviews for this product before I ordered. One customer said the sleeves were too big for her and she wears a 14/16. I wear the same, and this dress is TINY. I don't know if the one I got is missized, or what, but I can barely get my arms in to the sleeves, and it is not nearly long enough to be a dress.The seller will not take returns on the item once you have tried it on, so I am stuck with it. If you are a plus sized woman, there is no way in hell this is going to fit you. I would put it at a regular size large at the most. I'm very displeased."
4,"Sexy dress, but a little too big for me","I have this dress in the regular size and as I wrote in my review, the dress fits me more like a blouse, being too small for my size, even though I love the style and fabric. Don't we all wish we could be as beautiful and sexy as the model wearing this dress.As for the dress in a plus size, I can wear this clothing more as a dress, but the sleeves are too big for me. I usually wear a size 14 or 16 dress and 18 in pants. I also would have preferred an on the shoulder style. Yes, the panties are too skimpy, I would recommend wearing this dress with pantyhose, as I do, or with larger size sheer black panties. Nevertheless, this is a very sexy dress that some persons will enjoy wearing."
2,Pretty sexy and cute!,"This is a good outfit to ware around the house, or be flirty in bed! hahaOnly thing is bottom of dress was a lot tighter then expected. I had to stretch it out pretty good to fit right. But after thought, I turned it into a regular top, just ware a black tank over it."
5,Inspiring music,"I was hoping for a wonderful combination of easy listening, instrumental, spiritual and patriotic music. This CD definately delivered. I gave it as a gift to a close friend who needed some comforting as well as some uplifting music. It's safe to say....it continues to soothe her soul with a wonderful blend of both! Thank you!!!"
1,Where did they find this CRAP?,"Simply unbearable. The instrumental part of the album is cookie cutter pop dance. This would be bearable, and even a cliche`d enjoyment, if it weren't for the vocals.These are some of the worst vocals i've ever heard. It's just sad, really. Whoever sings this does not understand english very well, and has a very hard time speaking. I don't mean grammatical mistakes- i mean she can't get the words out, parts are left off and lost in barely recognizable accent. STICK WITH YOUR FIRST LANGUAGE MADAME.Am i being too hard on a CD-single i bought for 1.99 NEW? Perhaps so. But, in the off chance you NEEDED crappy music for any reason, get yourself some of this."
1,POR FAVOR QUE GRITERIA,"PARA OIR A ALGUIEN GRITANDO MEJOR ME VOY A DONDE UNA VECINA LOCA QUE SE PASA TODO EL DIA GRITANDO.NO PIERDAN SU DINERO, YA LE LLEGARA SU MOMENTO DE QUE LA GENTE SE CANSE Y CAIGA EN EL OLVIDO. NO VEO LA HORA DE QUE ESO PASE."
5,"AMEN are raw, angry, agressive & original. Incredible album","The energy and anger are punk - but with heavy guitars (punk/metal). Turn off that mainstream junk you're listening to, throw AMEN on and thank God that a band this amazing has come along to save us. AMEN! Reviews: Metal Hammer Magazine gave it 10 out of 10 stars & said ""Album of the year?"" & Kerrang! Magazine gave it 4 out of 5!"
5,amen for amen,"this is one of the best bands out there right now. casey chaos is one of the best singer's out there right now. this whole band is awesome. shannon larkin is one of the best drummer's i've heard in a while. broken design, drive, i don't sleep are some of the best songs on this album. if your a fan of hardcore metal and fast drumming and somewhat disurbing lyrics, pick up amen's s/t cd. and when your done with that, pick up there latest release, ""we have come for your parents!!!"""
4,Refreshing,"In a world full of bands that copy each other, Amen are a refreshing change. The singer's voice is one of a kind and great to listen to. The lyrics are very well written and the rest of the music is just amazing. Ross Robinson(Slipknot, Korn) and his skills are thrown into the mix, and that makes Amen just THAT much better.This cd is nothing revolutionary, but it is very good to listen to from time to time. Worth getting."
5,Unbelievebly loud and angry album from Casey Caos & co.,"I saw Amen September 7,99 before their debut album dropped.I wasn't very receptive of them because they were opening for Slipknot,Machine Head,and Coal Chamber.I couldn't wait to see those other bands so I didn't pay much attention to them until....they blasted into the song ""Coma America"" in which Corey from Slipknot joined them onstage. After that crazy a$$ song I knew the rest of their album couldn't be that bad,and it isn't.This is by far the best album in my collection and I suggest that anyone even remotely interested in hardcore or metal check it out.Especially fans of bands such as Dope,V.O.D,and Machine Head."
4,angry yet refreshingly wonderful,"Being a big fan of Snot I heard that some remaining member(s) joined Amen. I couldn't find the album anywhere. So eventually I ended up seeing them with Coal Chamber, Machine Head and Slipknot. I was very surprised with their preformance and soon after that, I bought the cd. The first track, which is one of my favorites, will give you a clear example of the built up anger inside these 5 amazing musicians who deserve more attention than some other bands that get a bit too much of it. You'll be surprised at the quality of their debut album!"
3,rock just got angry...,"Well there's quite a furious atmosphere to this one, a lot of rage built up in this album and its a good example of hard metal.I just failed to latch onto anything particuarly distinctive about Amen and lost interest after a while, quickly returning to Machine Head and the like. `Come America' and `No Cure for the Pure' were my two favourite tracks. But a reasonable debut from what could be a very good band, there's no doubt they can play but they need some better songs. If you like outright fast, furious, angry and extremely peed off raging metal then this could be your cup of tea."
5,Sort of like Harry Potter meets Anne of Green Gables...,"A Hogwarts-type school at the turn of the century! What an intruiging idea!Though this book starts out a little campy, with the main character gathering eggs on a small farm, and continues with some very pegan-like philosophy about magic, I found myself thoroughly enjoying ""A School for Sorcery."" Sabin's style is simple and lyrical, and her story has just enough unusual aspects to carry the reader through untill you begin to realize that the seemingly predictable plot is not what it seems!I finished this book in two days. It was excellant."
3,It works!,"My last food processor from Hamilton Beach lasted 20 years, so I decided since I have their blender as well, I'd purchase just the food processor attachment to add to my blender. The product fits and does the job, but I'm not happy with how insecurely it sits on the blender. Maybe it secures better on other models, but my model, Number 52600 is not the case. If this could be improved upon, you couldn't ask for a better machine. Also, I was dissapointed that my french fry cutter from the other Hamilton Beach food processor will not work with this newer version. All in all, it's not a bad product, just not what I'd hoped for."
5,great attachment,I broke the top of mine and was worried i would have to buy a new unit and have to learn how to use a different unit. It is just like the one I had and was half the cost of a replacing the whole thing motor and all. It arrived quickly and was well packaged.
2,Half-Blender & Half-food Processor,"Do you remember the Chevrolet El Camino and the Ford Ranchero? These vehicles combined a sedan's front seat with an open bed, in effect, half-car and half-pickup truck. In fact, they were less than half-car, and less than half-truck, failing on both counts except as convenient vehicles for very limited uses. The HB 70900 is similar: it tries to make a blender into half-blender and half-processor. As a blender, the blender is fine; as a food processor, it fails to reach the mark. We're just gonna buy a full-fledged food processor and use the 70900 as a convenience appliance for limited purposes."
5,Gold City,"Gold City is surely one of the very best is Gospel music. This CD ""Their Best"" is no exception.I love it. It was shipped and received quickly."
1,lack of information,"You know some of us get into many games like crossword puzzles. I have really gotten into word search games. I found that was a nice price but they failed to tell you that it does not work in windows XP, Windows 7 nor Windows 8. The packaging was terrible. It came in a jewel case with no instructions, just the disk and I had to go back to the comments of the people who had already received this game that was in the play on my system. I guess I have to watch more carefully at the reviews."
1,very dissatisfied,I am very upset with my purchase. After receiving the disc and it would not work I sent an email to the company. They responded immediately that the disc would not work with windows 7. I sent message back that this was not detailed when I bought it and I have not heard anything else from them. Obviously all they care about is selling the product and they dont care whether you can use it or not. I will not buy from them again.
4,Interesting take on French Cuisine,"Terrific regional cookbook and history behind the food. There has been very little that I tried that I did not like. The book, however, assumes that the reader knows how to cook, as there is very little that guides you through the steps - not your Julia Child type of work."
1,Culinaria France,"What a Great Book was Culinaria Italy. It's photography, it's organization, it's recipes. Magnificent! A 5 Star cookbook. Buy this one if you don't have it. Which brings me to Culinaria France. Same great photography and organization, but VERY FEW RECIPES AND NOT ONE WORTHWHILE. A really big disappointment."
2,Best game I ever paid $1 for,"Looking for a patch for this game is what lead me here. I bought this game locally at Target for $1. Can't beat that. Actually kinda fun. Road physics are actally pretty good. Collision engine not the best, but I've played a lot worse too. There a sound bug that leaves the engine sound reving in your ears even when in menus. There a collsion bug that, well, it looks like you enter another dimention. You float on the screen and can watch you speed indication go from whatever you were at when you crached to, well it goes up and up like I'm entering hyperspace or my car is the dilorian from back to the future. It hits 10000 mph and then you must crash into some hyperspace roadblock, cause it starts over again. Definately a game to get if you aren't sure if you like racing, war like games like this. Only problem is there really isn't much else out there like this now. Enjoy."
4,Good suspense and character study,"I read this some years ago and it stuck with me enough to want to have a copy to keep in my library. Basic story of vengeance when several friends seek to find the killer of their small group and exact retribution. They find the killer hired to do the job; a professional killer who is fanatical about physical conditioning and killing up close. He studies the human body and targets it like a surgeon. A great scene is when he is tracked by our group of protagonists and taken out of his element by one who is a skilled hunter and tracker. The scene where this stalk takes place is, to me, one of the best in the story.The reason behind their friend's death is a bit murky and to me, not the highlight of the tale, but it adds depth and throws a curve into the story. We ask ourselves..""how well do we know our friends?"". All in all a good story that fits the ""noir"" category....a dark and brooding city at night in the cold is the backdrop. Recommended."
1,Should be ZERO stars - Some people just cannot let go.,"Well folks, unfortunately the lowest I could rate this trash can collectable was 1 star, but we all know it is actually zero stars. I had the incredible misfortune of seeing High Holy Days Live (HA HA HA).........some words come to mind, terrible, repetitive, and incredibly boring and soaped up with TONS of cheese. Another great signing by another record label. This is so original.........I have never heard music like this before.......Bush, Nickelback, Default, Theory of a Deadman........and the list goes on and on......"
4,a different mind state...,"unlike ""weekend"", i found this album enjoyable. among the those two and ""appearence and the park"", this album appealed to my hip-hop sensibility. often i was able to freestyle rhymes over the beats. each song creates an image in my mind, like a miniature movie. during my drive across the united states, this is the only kreidler disk i took. my only suggestion would be is to listen to the music yourself and then decide...."
2,snooze,"Kreidler's Appearance And The Park album really had a great feeling with it's warm touch to the electronic soundcapes. but with this album, there seems to be more emphasis on a colder, more sterile atmosphere. these pieces seem rather detached and it doesn't work when they try to break out of that detachment and try their hand at acting quirky. it just sounds kinda embarrassing and frankly, boring. the inclusion of Momus on the second track is one of those main embarrasments. Leo Garcia's vocal contribution towards the end of the album work a little bit better, but the music sounds like warmed over leftovers. overall, this record just farts around and doesn't go anywhere. seek out Kreidler's first two records or their amazing Eve Future mini ep before attempting to digest this tepid excursion into tired and fruitless territory."
2,Not their best..,"I don't know what happened. their debut CD was so much better. I can't feel anything from this one, which is full of kinky weird beats and strange melodies.. :/"
3,Not quite what I had expected,"I bought this product because I was interested in learning more about child development and how it related to baby massage. This woman is an ok teacher; she knows what she is doing, but she didn't quite hold my attention like I had expected she would."
4,older version preferred,"The dvd I received was the 'new edition' so running time is only 30 min and information seems quite basic and not that informative. The massage part is very quick but each move is explained. Overall for the money & other reviews, I expected much more. **I contacted seller and they sent the older version to me right away. I prefer the older dvd-longer running time, more informative and detailed. Great customer service-thanks!"
1,Ton Koopman Tortures Bach - Again,"If you've ever heard what Ton Koopman does to music in the name of ""Performance Practices"", you'll be astonished to learn that TELDEC has chosen him to do it again in their Complete Bach set. Amazing and very disappointing. It certainly explains its relatively low cost. If you don't care about these keyboard works, some of the rest of it is quite good - the Brandenburg Concertos for example. Be sure to buy the sampler disk first and listen to the first cut (especially the literally agonizing Toccata) to see if you can stand it before shelling out the money for the whole thing. And TELDEC, SHAME ON YOU !"
4,Good for the price,"I have used this product twice now. It heats up quickly enough. I think the bottom cooks a little faster than the top, but it wasn't a problem. Aesthetically it could look prettier, but it works well so far. No complaints."
4,Makes Great Waffles,"Nothing new to add, this makes great waffles. We even take it camping. Our only recommendation is shop around, if you have the time, this can be bought for less."
4,Works fine,"Simple but it does the job well. No timer or other automatic indicator, so you do need to keep an eye on things, but we've had perfect waffles every time. Nice compact configuration for storage as well."
5,Kids are happy,This waffle maker is a great addition to the kitchen. The kids used to eat those frozen (expensive) waffles. Not any more. They love the fresh-baked ones that this waffle maker produces.
1,Cleaning and sticking is a nightmare!,We just got this waffle maker and used it once and it was a nightmare! The waffles completely stuck to the pan and it is so hard to clean we will be returning right away!
3,Waffle maker,"There is no adjustable setting. I prefer my waffle to be very light, not crispy, so I don't wait till the indicator light to be off. It says ""easy to clean"" but I'm not sure if I can wash it with water... It's been okay cleaning with wet paper towel but what if it gets really dirty?"
5,Procter Silex 26500Y Belgian Waffle Baker,I purchased this for my husband who loves to make homemade waffles. He uses it constantly and loves it. Its very easy to clean and use. Its worth the money...for great waffles...
3,Okay with Spray,"I have only made waffles twice so far. The first time I sprayed it with cooking spray (the directions said to do it the first time you used it) and they were fine. Since it didn't say to keep doing it, I didn't spray the second time and they stuck. I think it will be ok, but I will again use the cooking spray.The good news is that the waffles were light and fluffy with deep indents, just like I like them."
4,Easy and fast waffle,"It is easy to use, just pour in the waffle batter, about 5 min, you will have a nice hot waffle. The maker is non-stick, and easy to clean. Comes out perfect all the time."
3,"Good waffle maker, but there is better","I actually own both this and the Presto 3510 FlipSide Belgian Waffle Maker and I can honestly without a doubt say that that Presto is a better waffle maker. This one works alright with making plain waffles, but it seems to run out of power when making multiple waffles with berries inside.I was actually using both this and the Presto machine together and although the first few waffles from this machine were good, each subsequent waffle was worse and worse. However the Presto machine would consistently make nicer waffles. For the extra few dollars I would go with Presto!"
2,Takes forever,"This waffle maker is sturdy, more so than the last one I owned, but it doesn't heat quickly at all. It also takes forever to bake a waffle in it. When you have a large family you want them done in a pretty quick manner so that everyone can enjoy. One member of the family would be done and ready for another before I could get one out to the next person. It makes for a long frustrating morning. I guess cooking for just one would be fine though."
2,Already Not Working Right After 1 Month,"I bought this waffle iron from Amazon.com about a month ago after reading good reviews. It worked great the first couple of times we made waffles, but now it isn't working right. The top side of the waffle cooks much slower than the bottom side, so we either have a way too crispy bottom or we have to turn the waffle over to let the top cook more. Maybe this one is just a lemon?"
3,"Good deal for the money, but not a ""forever"" appliance","I bought this waffle iron about 4 years ago. It makes quality waffles. It's also small and lightweight, so it stores easily.It doesn't have a timer, just a light that goes off telling you it's preheated. When I first started using it, it took about 4 minutes to make a nice crunchy waffle. Now it takes 7+ minutes for the same effect.It's difficult to clean - the best I can do is wipe off the oil with paper towels. I would love one where the plates are dishwasher safe."
4,Makes good waffles,"My girlfriend and I got this for our new apartment, it comes with recipes for different types of waffles and small so it's easy to store it out of the way. If you use Pam the waffle should come right off, even olive oil works decently well and if nothing sticks to it then clean up is pretty quick and easy.The only real problem is figuring out how much batter to use, what the instructions say isn't enough so the best way to do it is to pour it on slowly and let it fill in everywhere but other then that this thing is pretty awesome."
2,proctor silex waffle maker - not worth the money,"I should have listened to all the bad reviews and not wasted my money, terrible smell..had to run it 3x's before able to use it, called the company w/no help...takes longer to clean it than it does to make waffles, very hard to clean because it does not come apart. I would not recommend wasting your money."
3,so far so good,ive only used this once and it heated up just fine and made a delicous waffle it was also very easy to clean
2,I HATE IT,You cannot put it in the sink to scrub and wash it. You have to use a soft soapy cloth. Well that doesn't work with all the grooves. I am soo bummed as this got great reviews. Very disappointed!
2,Barely does the job,"For an inexpensive waffle maker it does the job. The downside though, the plates are not remove able making cleaning difficult. It takes a while to heat up, and judging cook time is, at best, a learning curve. I would not recommend this product."
5,Great waffle maker,"Makes great waffles. I am very happy with the product. Waffles are nice and thick, crispy on the outside and tender in the middle, and looked good enough for a restaurant presentation."
4,College kid's review,"I paid $20 for one, used. And, lo and behold, it makes waffles. If you need something really fancy (i.e., something with a timer or something non-stick, or dishwasher friendly or whatever) then this isn't for you. However, I'm broke, and it makes good waffles. Just put a little coconut oil on the griddle before your batch and then clean it with a wet rag when you're done. It heats up quickly (and makes the entire room hot) and has worked great for me. I expect another ten years out of it. For $20-$30, it's a decent and dependable waffle maker."
5,Very pleased!,This waffle maker definitely met my expectations and then some. The best one I've ever owned. Two thumbs up for sure!
4,Works as a great gift,"(+) Durable, cooks evenly, does not spill over (small risk of overfilling because of the very deep pockets), nonstick surface even if you do not spray it with oil. Very sturdy, somewhat heavy for its size and larger than expected (I'm comparing to the Cuisinart waffle maker) but can still store easily standing up(-) I wish it had an indicator to tell you when the waffles were done. Not that big of an issue though as it has a low risk of burning your waffles."
5,Wow'd with this waffle baker,"Bought this a year ago after tiring a local cafe that charged $10+ for a meal of these Belgian waffles/per person in our family and realized we should be making them at home! This makes fabulous Belgian waffles, just scrumptious. Don't bother with the expensive other irons out there, this one is fabulous. I've entertained using this and blown away guest. Professional quality and comes with great recipes.... just wish it made more than 1 at a time but it isn't that big of a deal breaker."
4,Waffle lady's choice,"I am the ""Waffle Lady"" at my local farmers' market and make over 100 waffles every Saturday using these irons. I have four irons (three of this variety) and they each make about 25 waffles in a row and I've never had a problem. My only wish was that they cooked a little faster, they take about five minutes. People don't seem to mind waiting though!"
3,Good for the money spent,"This waffle iron is average --pretty standard for a waffle iron in this price range. The waffles turn out well, but (like every other waffle iron I have tried) they always end up sticking to the iron, so the top and bottom halves rip apart. No problem for me, but it you're really concerned about making pretty waffles, I suggest buying one of the bigger industrial irons that you manually flip. Careful opening this one, BTW, it gets very steamy as you're cooking the waffle, and you can burn your hand as you try to open it."
1,Noxious odor,"Waffle iron had a noxious odor. I called the company who said if I cycled the iron twice, the odor would lessen. The odor was still there so I returned the item- maybe I had a bad batch. The company did admit the problem."
1,break after first waffle finished and the 2nd stuck in it..,"So lucky to have a ""king unit""; means the one who escaped from the QC line.Broken after 1st waffle finished and stop to heat up for 2nd one.unplug and let it sit for 30 minutes and try to use again, still not heat at all, the heating light never light up again...too bad"
1,Not easy to clean,"The waffles are fine, but I don't understand the comments about it being easy to clean. You can't wash it, and can't reach the deep wells easily to wipe it off so it is hard to remove any left over oil."
3,Proctor-Silex belgian waffle baker 26500,This unit was tested with two other brands and it did not consistently produce a waffle ea time. I followed the mfgs instructions per se and then cooked 5 more waffles. 3 were so/so and two just did not cook well enough and the waffle pulled apart. So I tried PAM this seemed to help but the mfg did not suggest this method.It has only one heat setting. You plugged in in and it would audible and a light come on when it got hot enough and when supposedly the waffle was about done the same. As we all say maybe this one unit was built on Monday or Friday. It did not feel heavy enough to really be a good belgian waffle maker to me.
4,Proctor Silex 26500 Morning Baker Belgian Waffle Baker,"This is a nice little waffle maker. Makes waffles in about 5 minutes or less and it bakes them evenly all throughout. I would recommend this for anyone that doesn't want to spend a lot on a waffle maker. Makes regular as well as belgian waffles. We like to add fruit such as small blueberries to our batter and they come out just great. I would have to give this a four out of five just because it isn't real large. Thanks, Carol"
5,Great Waffle Iron!,"While researching waffle irons on Amazon, I came across the Proctor-Silex 26500Y. After reading the other reviews I decided to give it a try. This waffle iron is great, and has a great price to match! It makes the perfect, deep pocket belgian waffles every time. The non-stick surface is great; you don't have to spray it first. It is easy to clean and easy to store. Perfect for a weekend treat!"
3,just ok not great,I bought this a month ago. If you don't spray it with a cooking spray the waffle will stick every time. It is easier to clean the waffle iron when it is hot. Don't think it is worth 26 dollars more like 16 dollars. I purchase this because it was non stick but not really.
4,Great!,"Bought this after doing a lot of research on waffle irons and glad I did. It is wonderful! Easy to use, the indicator light worked perfectly for my batter and the family ate them up! Gonna get a lot of use out of this!"
5,Do you like waffles? YEAH! I like waffles!,Heats up and cooks very quickly. It can easily feed 4 people efficiently.Haven't had anything stick to the iron.The waffles come out perfect every single time.It's a quality waffle iron.
5,Simplicity Equals Ease of Use,"This is a great waffler that really and truly does not stick. The waffles I've made are perfect, crisp and tender. No extras, just a simple waffle maker. No bells, no whistles, no Bluetooth Notifier, no expensive rotating flipper thing ... just a simple, straight ahead excellent waffle maker. It works as advertised."
5,"great big waffles, nice small waffle iron","The waffles this turns out use almost twice as much batter as our old square waffle iron. They are very good, well cooked but not crispy/brittle. The iron itself seems small and sleek. So far it seems easy to keep clean and works perfectly (just about a month of steady use)."
4,Very Good but Slow,"Excellent waffles, but the machine is slow to heat, and slow to cook. That is the only flaw I find."
3,"Crisp Belgian waffles,,,but a pain to clean!!","Like most of the very positive reviews, I do agree that this unit makes awesomely crisp waffles, because of the non-detachable grill plates that heat more directly than detachable plates. However it is this non-detachable feature that makes cleaning a pain. ""Just wipe down with soapy cloth and then wipe clean"" is not as simple as it sounds! Remember that because this is a Belgian waffle maker, the grooves are deeper, thus harder to clean the deep bits. I would rather prefer detachable plates for ease of cleaning..."
2,Grates do not come out for cleaning.,The waffle maker works fine but the grates are not removable for cleaning.I did not notice that when I bought it or I would not have purchased this model.I think removable grates should be standard on all waffle makers.
2,Good until it died,"I bought the waffle maker for my mother who LOVES waffles. I will say that it made great waffles the first three times we used it. On the fourth use, the unit made one waffle then shut off. It hasn't turned on again. I noticed that the manufacturer offers a 1 year warranty. This unit is going back."
2,Started out good,Made good waffles when I got it but now it burns them to a crisp.There is no adjustment on it to compensate for the ageing of the internal components.
4,Simple and straightfoward,"Very simple to use-there is a light that shuts off when the iron is done preheating, and when it is done cooking. This waffle iron is nonstick which is helpful, however the fact that none of the parts are removable still make this difficult to clean. The many crevices are difficult to get to even if they are nonstick. Users should definitely grease the iron prior to each use to ensure the waffle comes out as desired, as well as for making cleaning easier."
2,"Decent, but Lacking","We had a waffle maker, which broke. We replaced it with this because of its lack of controls on the front, which is what did in our previous waffle maker. It's a decent waffle maker, and it makes crisp, fluffy waffles. However, I think it overcooks them a bit for my liking, and it's not configurable to change the cook time, so I have to peer in occasionally to see if the waffles are done to my liking. Also, it does not use any audible tone to indicate that waffles are finished, which is another negative for me. Finally, I feel like it takes forever to cook waffles, and that's my main dissatisfaction with it."
4,Enjoying so far!,"Used this a couple of times to great success. It makes a great product in terms of texture....crispy outside and fluffy inside. I am a big cook, but I do admit I miss having some sort of timer or light to alert me that its done. Probably something I'm just going to get used to versus my past makers. I'm happy with it!"
4,"Recommend, with reservations","There is one design flaw in this unit - no breathing room between the griddle and the front handles to lift the top. Having the front lip attached to the main body, means that you will need a potholder to lift the lid each time you make a waffle.This said, however, I found that the waffles cooked well and browned evenly. The interior design appears to be a little bigger and deeper than my previous Belgian waffle maker (Oster), so my batter didn't stretch as far as usual. Personally, I find the deeper grooves, and slightly larger circumference a plus to the overall quality of the waffle. Note: baking time was slightly longer as well, at about 4 minutes instead of 3 per waffle."
4,waffles,This has been a great waffle maker. The waffles cook up great and never stick. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is becasue the griddles do not come out for cleaning.
4,Quick,Overal this waffle baker is quite smooth. It's also MUCH quicker than my other waffle baker. Personally I found removing the waffles easier if I sprayed it with oil after every second batch.
3,Follow the instructions + 2 minutes,"I followed the instructions EXACTLY which tell you what to do when the light turns off and on. There is a preheat light and a ""done"" light. My waffles were still gooey so I waited for the light then waited another 2 or 3 minutes. Not a big deal, just a little work around to making sure the waffles were done. It could just be that I prefer well-done waffles. It's not too bad to clean. Similar to a George Foreman grill but no meat charcoal or grease to deal with so easier. We also bought waffle mix ASIN # B001ELL60W and it was tasty. Don't spend too much on a waffle maker....they're just waffles."
2,You get what you pay for,"I bought this to replace my Hamilton Beach Fluff and Flip, which is now unavailable. The HB was great but after 2 yrs the waffles started sticking--this means we ate off the teflon and time to replace. Based on the many excellent reviews, I bought the Proctor Silex. I was disappointed as soon as I opened it--very light and cheap looking, hard to clean, no timer, no way to gauge when the waffles are done, etc., but I got out my timer and dealt w/ it because my family loves waffles. Almost exactly a year later, this one is sticking, ie the teflon is gone.We eat a lot of waffles, but a year doesn't seem very long to me, even considering the very low made-in-China piece of junk price. Unless you plan to only use this for special occasions, I recommend you try another brand/make of waffle maker, or plan to replace it after a year, or expect to eat a thin layer of teflon in a year's time."
3,not as i expected,"searching in depth, for a good waffle iron,concluded that proctor silex would be just that.However, was disappointed since I found the handle gets to hot to touch without a pot holder, and one side of waffle gets brown,and the other side does not get done at all.certainly not as Ihoped it would be."
3,Hit and miss,"Waffles come out good, crispy and flaky. But the machine takes forever to warm up, and cleaning it is a nightmare since the metal plates can not be removed for cleaning."
4,Very good so far,"I have only used this waffle iron once. I did ten whole wheat waffles from scratch. For the first one, I used too much batter (almost a cup), so it spilled over and required some clean up, but the waffle was still good. The other nine came out perfectly. I usually like more uses before doing a review, but so far I am very pleased. It is very easy to use. This one is white in color, but it looks nice."
5,Fast & Easy Waffle Making,"A no-frill value waffle maker. Just follow the instruction and in about 4 minutes, you get a great-tasting waffle. Sunday morning can never be better when your family members praise you for the perfect waffles you make..."
3,"After a year, waffles sticking a lot.","After just over a year and only occasional use, waffles now stick constantly. I do use spray. Also a pain to clean around the plates. Would be better if the plates were removable. Now buying a replacement. Many thanks to all those who leave reviews: makes picking one a breeze."
2,disappointed,"After reading the good reviews for this waffle maker I added it to my amazon wishlist and received it as a Christmas gift.We are SO disappointed with this waffle maker. The waffles aren't crisp. They come out more like tall pancakes with squares in them.In addition, the waffles tend to stick to the waffle maker and it's hard to get that stuff out of there.We aren't nearly as happy with this waffle maker as we were with our Presto 03510 FlipSide Belgian Waffle Maker. That thing made the crispiest waffles ever. Since it stopped working after 2 years I thought I'd try something else hoping it would last longer. It might last longer but the waffles aren't very waffly.I'm thinking of buying the Presto again because I miss those crispy waffles..."
5,Best waffles ever!,"Simply amazing! Buy it, you will not regret it! Only 26 dollars and you get the nicest homemade waffles! Very dependable and easy cleaning."
2,What am I doing wrong?,"I SO wanted to love this product. It does create crisp, delicious waffles, BUT... No matter what I do, the waffles STICK to the plates. I use more oil in the mix -- they stick. I spray the heck out of the thing with cooking spray -- they stick. I spray minimally or not at all -- they totally stick. Today I made a total of 5 waffles, spraying before each one. The first one didn't stick too badly. Each one got progressively worse, until I finally had to practically chisel number 5 out. Additionally, it takes around 10 minutes for each waffle to get done. Did I just get a lemon?"
3,Cleaning is not that easy,"I have this wafflemaker, and it works great - fast and easy. But when it comes to cleaning up - it is a mess. You cannot remove the irons and wash them, so the only option is wiping all those nooks and crannies with a paper towel - and you will have to wait for a while before the unit cools off. I hate to use this thing because of clean up involved. The batter does not stick to the irons, but anyway after wiping you can see it is not completly clean and dry. I would prefer removable irons."
2,Wouldn't buy this again,"I bought this from Amazon about a year ago. It did made nice waffles for about six months, and my family loved it despite the poor design that requires pot holders to open the hot lid. The heating element gradually went down after that, batter didn't rise well, and waffles started stuck to the iron without a lot of spray oil. It wasn't worth the money. I would rather spend more and buy a more reliablbe one next time."
5,The perfect waffle maker!,"I was reticent to purchase this waffle maker since it did not have the flip feature like the more expensive models and was considerably less expensive than the Waring, Black & Decker, and Cuisinart. I made the leap after learning that my mother's tastiest waffles came not from her expensive Krups flip model but from a cheap no frills one like this. I am pleased to report it was a wise decision as this mighty machine produces perfect golden brown waffles that are light and fluffy on the inside each and every time even when using whole wheat batter. I cannot recommend it highly enough."
2,Must Listen to Both Victims.,"The war time resetlemnt of Gottscheers was a tragic injustice, the Gottscheers predominantly ended with better farms then they left, and the Slovenes who were dispossessed like a stray cat, were left with nothing, not even a roof over their head, and not even sympathy for the victims.One should wonder how guilty a Gottscheer should have felt, having received a new farm, and not asked about the welfare of its previous owner and inhabitant.I may even be argued that nobody had an option. Even that's not correct, most did resettle, but many did not. Its possible that most who did not resettle were of mixed marriage, and is also true that many who did resettle were also of mixed marriage.Its time, the Polish pope appologized to Jews, its also time for Gotcheers to apologize to Slovenians."
2,"Well, it's definately pocket-sized...",...but that's about the only advantage. This book is not at all thorough enough to take hunting for actual identification of finds. Very general info w/ very bad photos.
2,Very slow reading,This book just dosent make the reader excited and thus makes reading this book a chore. At this time all that has been said int this book has been said elsewhere in a much more interesting format.
4,"yes, bizarre!","This is a wonderful collection of objects, truly an artistic selection of eye-popping, category-crossing, often beautiful things. Each object also has a very very nice description, laying out who made and why, and giving an idea of how it functions. You get battery-operated tongues - think of the uses you can put that to! - and scores of traditional objects such as funery slippers and straw hats or cow-tail medicinal brushes. It is a feast for the imagination, funny, and provocative.Recommended for industrial designers and art lovers alike."
3,Poorly made,I loved this earrings and got a few compliments on them. I was disappointed that one of the spiders fell off about a month and a half after I bought them. I was taking them off them the spider came completely off. I loved the way they looked but were poorly made. Very disappointed.
4,"Arrived Broken, but I was sent a new pair","They arrived broken, but I called and was sent a new pair right away!"
4,They Actually Look Like Tarantula Spiderlings!,"As a tarantula keeper (I have 5 at home), I always try to look for unique items such as these. Caution- they are really tiny! I've already lost one of them. (Guess it scurried away)It's nice to see that they actually look like tarantulas and not true spiders."
2,"""Cogita ante salis."" (Think before you leap (or roughly - Look before you leap.) )","It's ok but this album came up in respect to another artist and had nothing to do with the song I was expecting. In addition, I'm not certain Luis Ferry rates the title of ""Maestro""."
2,Doesn't Live up to Milk Shake Memories,"Remember those wonderful milkshakes from the soda fountain? Well, you won't recreate them with this machine. I should have listened to the reviews. The hook was ""retro."" I decided to follow the manual recipe for a chocolate shake to make sure it wasn't my failing. The beater is so small it didn't even mix up 2 scoops of fairly soft ice cream, 1/4 cup of milk, and a tablespoon of chocolate syrup. Don't buy it!"
2,dissapointed,"the appearance of this product is wonderful, if only it had metal blades, even as an add on option it would be highly recomended. But that is not the case. the cheap plastic blades have a tough time blending anything harder than ice cream with a lot of milk. will not blend ice, and has a hard time with berries. Save your money and get a magic bullet instead."
3,Looks Can Be Deceiving,"My mixer arrived in one piece. I immediately noticed that it was more chrome-look plastic than actual steel, like a professional model. The mixing stem is removable for easy cleaning, but during operation it seems to need a lot of help to mix ice cream (maneuvering the cup up and down to ""jiggle"" the contents). I think this may be due to the fact that the end of the stem is just a small rippled plastic paddle, not a steel, winged blade like a professional model. The steel cup is smaller than I expected, but it holds plenty of liquid. The tilt head feature is nice, and the motor has two speeds."
1,For Decoration Only,"My chrome version burned out on the first milkshake! The machine would be fine if it had a heavy-duty motor -- and a steel blade. Fortunately for me, the vendor was understanding and refunded my purchase price and paid for return shipping. I'm going to try my luck with the Waring ..."
2,Not worth the money or effort,"Why bother paying money for something that only stirs drinks (spoons work!) or blends cocktails and milkshakes (that's what blenders are for!). I received this as a gift, and at first thought it was the neatest thing... a retro milkshake maker. But it doesn't have much power, you have to make sure the cup is securely on or a huge mess will splatter everywhere, and if your ingredients are hard (like ice or ice cream) you'll be waiting forever for the drink to be made. Stick with a regular blender for milkshakes and drinks, and save some money and counter space."
1,do not buy,"I bought this a while ago thinking it would be perfect for shakes, boy was i wrong. Its cute but thats about all its good for. I agree with the others stick with your blender."
1,Hamilton Beach - Shame on you!,The Hamilton Beach 730C Classic DrinkMaster is a complete waste of money! It is not sturdy or powerful enough to make a milkshake - at least one that actually contains ice cream! It doesn't mix anything! What a waste! By the Oster instead or go to a garage sale and get the real thing.
1,Weak motor - burned out,"In less than one month of light use, this item self-destructed. Weak motor, that burned out only trying to mix icecream drinks. Save your money. Buy the Braun handheld instead!!! Strong motor, and much more versatile too."
1,Junk!!!!!!,The junk broke the day after it was delivered that's why I called it JUNK. For anyone looking for a good shake maker try a different brand!
2,Drink Maker,"I am a bit disappointed in this drink mixer as it doesn't have much power to mix the shakes. Also, wish the mixing cup it uses was larger."
2,Not good for ice cream :(,"This product could be great if you just want to mix powdered drinks. However, I bought it for ice cream shakes/malts. This is NOT a good product for that. It is not powerful enough for ice cream and the mixer continues to hit the side of the metal cup making loud noises. I will stick to my blender."
4,works great!!,Kids love it. Getting constant use! It always preforms as expected each and every time. Looks great on the counter. Clean up is a breeze.
1,Should have known better,"This product is a complete joke.I bought three of these units. I can't believe it,they don't mix. What a piece of junk. These are coming back!"
4,Hamilton Beach Mixer,"This is so much easier to use and clean than a blender. The stainless steel cup rinses quickly and cleanly along with the mixer rod. I used it everyday for 3 years before it failed. My complaint would be that such a simple devise should have a longer life.""B"""
1,They don't make 'em like they used to,"What a waste! This cheap plastic knockoff is nothing compared to Hamilton Beach's sturdy, 12.5-pound classic milkshake maker. Save your money and don't buy this embarrasing modern appliance. Search for the original, made of cast iron, chrome and enamel. ..."
3,"Soso quality, but it works","If you think you are getting a repro of the old original HB mixer, you will be unhappy. This is a very lightweight knockoff that works very hard to finish a shake. It does work eventually. At least it is cheap to buy."
4,Great mixer,I like my new mixer it looks good and works fine.The last hamilton beach mixer I had lasted 15 years.Would recomend this to anyone.
2,"Looks cool, but a spoon would be faster","I couldn't wait to start making real milkshakes with the DrinkMaster I received as a gift. However, once I got started, wait was all I did. I had to use the mixing tip like a saw blade to cut through the ice cream - if I put the mixing tip directly in the ice cream, the motor quickly ran down to nothing. After five minutes of sawing and mixing, I had a great-looking banana milkshake. Unfortunately, when I poured it out, I still found large banana chunks left in my glass.Perhaps I should have microwaved the ice cream first and pureed the banana in a food processor before putting it in the the DrinkMaster... I quickly returned this item to the store as ""cute, but not useful""."
1,Useless,"Was so looking forward to finally getting a milkshake maker and as there are not any in the UK had to get this Hamilton Beach shipped over - what a waste of money!One positive is that is looks great. Major negative is that it is not useable so it will end up looking great in the bin.The problem seems to be that the machine itself is too powerful. Whatever level you fill this machine when you swtich it on at the slower or faster level the machine just aggressively throws the contents all over the kitchen.We have tried everything from different levels, different liquids to different amount of ice cream and even put the ice cream in small pieces and no ice cream at all - nothing works.And on the worst part as I am in the UK to send it back would cost nearly as much as buying the product so an expensive lesson learnt."
2,Mixer,"This would be fine for juice drinks but I was wanting a smaller ""blender"" type for milkshakes. The glass isn't very large and you can't make much drink or it will go everywhere! It wasn't very suitable for my needs but I think it might be ok for others."
2,It says it is made of chrome.....,"The entire machine is made of chrome, EXCEPT for the piece that does the mixing, which is PLASTIC. I was disappointed."
2,Plastic instead of metal,"I thought this would be a heavy, metal type of mixer like the one my grandparents had. Instead it was plastic, light weight and just not what I was expecting."
4,Retro beauty!,"I love the retro styling of my new drink mixer. It adds charm to my kitchen decor and we are having fun mixing up cool, refreshing, summertime drinks with it. Ice cream is our new favorite food group!"
1,I Agree With The Negative Reviews,"I bought this at a good price but eventually gave it away. It doesn't do anything as well as a $10 hand mixer. I honestly can't imagine why they designed it, made it or sold it. Doesn't do what you think it should. Just looks nice."
3,Mixer review,"The mixer seems a little weak, When You have a lot of ice cream in the cup the motor seems to have trouble with it. If you work long enought and it softens up it starts to work better. I have never been able to just load and stick vthe cup on the hanger and let it go bye itself. Also I have never been able to complete a milk shake in 2 minutes, It takes a lot longer due to manual cup usage required."
1,Hope you like THIN milkshakes,"This is a cheap product. The ""blade"" is very small and the motor does not have enough power. Thick milkshakes are out of the question. This thing is only good for making chocolate milk. I have worked in ice-cream shops for years and this thing is completely useless. I will be seeking a complete refund. I suggest you look elsewhere if you truly want a machine that can mix a real milkshake."
3,Okay for the money,"Makes shakes fine, but the motor could be a little more powerful. I wouldn't suggest using large pieces of ice.Still, it works fairly well."
1,Toothpick for a mixer,"I was excited about the thought of using a nostalgic chrome mixer for ice cream shakes. Unfortunately, this product has the strength and blending power of a toothpick. The mixer wand is about 1 inch in diameter and made of very cheap plastic. It doesn't mix ice cream worth a dime... This is the first product I've ever had to return to Amazon. Don't waste your money."
2,You get what you pay for.,"I ordered one and returned it the day after it arrived. The unit is flimsy and very lightwieght. For very light mixing it might be OK. I upgraded to a Waring Drink Mixer. Yeah, it's more expensive, but it's base is cast metal, it's sturdy, and it's motor easily outclasses the Hamilton Beach."
2,This product is not worth anything!!,Its made of plastic which is not poerful. It spills the drink you are trying to make and is really messy. It dusnt blend much at all and takes a lot of effort to clean.
1,stick with a blender,"I got this mixer for christmas and was so excited. We make milkshakes several times a week and I thought the mixer would be great. It sucked. Like every other review says, it makes a hole in the middle of the ice cream and then the cup just spins. I probably only used it a dozen times and then went back to the blender. Then i decided to give it another chance, and the motor started sounding like it was shifting gears. The low gear sounded like weed whacker. If i knew where the box was, I would send it back to the company."
1,Not a Mixer or DrinkMaster ~ Waste of Money!!,"The old saying, ""You get what you pay for"" certainly applies to this machine. I always thought Hamilton Beach had a good reputation for putting out quality products. This is far from quality. It works fine until you put something in it like Ice Cream - then it grinds to a halt. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!Hamilton Beach 730C Classic DrinkMaster Drink Mixer, Chrome"
1,You can find one for $5 at most thift stores - Rate: 0 Star,"Usally used only once, and $5.00 is $5.00 too much. Theonce proud name of H-B is nothing but a marking name now,what a way great product to have someone remember withthey are looking for any kitchen tool. I can't imagineanyone who bought this thing would ever by a H-B productever again.Find someone to demo a model #33 !!! and you will findwhat real shake mixer can do.Save your money, by a good blender (thats another story),and use it, some brands you can get a milk shake blade for,or use a mixer.-pete a very happy owner of a Model 33."
1,Poor Performer,"I got this as a gift and will be returning it shortly. I was surprised to see others had similar problems as I'm sharing here. My first attempt at a milkshake and the motor vibrated horribly, started smoking and then quit. All I had for ingredients was chocolate syrup, milk and one scoop of ice cream. The ice cream wasn't rock-hard either. I expected more from Hamilton Beach; I guess they just don't make them like they used to."
4,Nice little shake machine,It does't make the 32 ounce shakes I remember from the good old days but it does a good job and perhaps less is better for the waist line.
2,Fine for powdered drinks,"As others have pointed out, this device is flimsy, and I'm not surprised it can't make a milk shake. However, I bought mine to make powdered protein fitness drinks more palatable, and it does this perfectly. I've used it for this purpose for 2 years, and it's still going strong.It's a good thing they've discounted it to $..., since that's about what it's worth."
2,Poor quality drink mixer.,"I bought this as a gift for my significant other and must say we are both disappointed. The item is made out of cheap plastic, is very easy to knock over, and does little more than swirl around the ingredients in the metal cup. It takes it a LONG time to make a milkshake (basically, you keep mixing until the ice cream simply melts), and it certainly won't break down ice. Also, while the description says you can remove the mixing ""blade"", ours arrived stuck into the moveable head. While that may simply be a defect in our unit, it makes it a pain to wash. Unless you are essentially looking for an automated spoon, purchase a different drink mixer."
4,Good stuff for the price,"Use it for making greek frappe at home and it does a very good job. You get better frappe not using the supplied cup though, but rather using a smaller diameter cup. But its very reliable, great motor in it (rarely have to go to the high-speed setting) and not that noisy.Only improvement would be to use a metal blade, but i have no problems with the one it has now....heck, you cant expect too much for $26 bucks! :)"
4,Seems Ok,"This thing is plastic, if you think otherwise. It makes great smoothies, and has performed well. No complaints here."
1,hamilton beach drink mixer,it is too slow....is doesn't mix milkshakes well...it is not powerful enough. i would like to return it for credit. please let me know how.
4,energy saving light,This is a great product. I put it in my porch light. It puts out bright white light. How many times have you lift your porch light on all night. Well at 20w it won't break the bank on energy use.
5,I Just Love These Guys!!!,"The first in the Cleek series, you are introduced to the crafty ""bad guy"" Cleek. If you enjoy reading Sherlock Holmes mysteries, you should enjoy these as well. I have downloaded several Cleek mysteries and have found them all very entertaining."
2,Well..,"Relatively good acting goes nowhere thanks to this lazy piggyback-on-previous-movies-plot (Officer and a Gentleman meets Rocky type deal) chocked with implausible, even ridiculous (and from a military viewpoint-sacrilegious) military scenes. People who haven't seen and/or appreciated the classic An Officer And A Gentleman may find more accessible (albeit numbing) entertainment in this copycat action-spiked fun film."
3,Rent before you buy!!!!!,"Thankfully I rented this moving before I bought it. While it was somewhat entertaining it is one movie whose rewatchability is almost zero. The ending was unfulfilling and the last boxing match should have been done differently. If you must have it, wait for a couple months and it will be under $10 in no time..."
1,All about boxing,If boxing is your thing then this is the movie for you. Very little of this movie is about the rigors of training for military life as an officer.
3,An Officer and a Gentleman Redux,"This is an updated and borrowed version of Richard Gere and Louis Gosset Jr's ""An Officer and a Gentleman"". This time its about a young welder who finally gets into the US Naval Academy Annapolis and faces off against his commanding officer Cole. Its a hard year and full of the ocassional romance with the requisite female. Annapolis is not bad and has an attractive cast but most fans of this film will be military fans who just love the genre."
2,Officer & a Gentlemen Ripoff,"very similar to an officer and a gentlemen, but no passion, and this is a lousy movie. the DVD will be in the $1 bin by the new year."
3,Movies,"This movie had strong acting (with great actors and actresses), the plot could have been more interesting, and the ending was sub-par. This movie is worth watching, but not paying $20.00 for a DVD."
1,Utterly predictable,"This movie is cliche-ridden from start to finish. A young man from the shipyards gets into Annapolis at the last minute, is miserably ill-prepared, overcomes all obstacles, and pulls off a feat no plebe could ever hope to accomplish. All the stock characters are here--cold father; abusive commander; sympathetic, pretty junior officer; the guy who doesn't make it; the guy who tries to commit suicide when he fails; the bad plebe turned good guy. Plus, you see every twist and turn of the plot coming from a mile away. I thought it was a waste of time."
2,embarrassingly poor rip-off of an officer and a gentleman,"Save your time and money, and get the real deal, An officer and a gentlemen. There is SO much unbelievebility to the whole premise of this movie, and the utter mismatched 'climax' to the thing, (a boxing match ??? ..against your superior officer???...isn't this supposed to be about the rigors of life in the naval academy???)...Nearly every facet of this movie feels like the creators watched 'An officer and a gentlemen' a few times, and flat out lifted ideas left and right and used them in a disjointed, mismash fashion....Just poorly done all around. I give it two stars because you MIGHT find it mildly entertaining if you haven't seen 'officer and a gentlemen', and thus don't have something VASTLY superior to compare it with."
4,"Annapolis: 3 and a half stars, more like 4","Jake Huard (James Franco) joins the navy. When he gets there, he sees it's not everything he would have hoped it is. Lt. Commander Burton and Lt. Cole (Tyrese Gibson) are mean and rude. Burton keeps picking on this one guy, who's kind of chubby, nicknames him Twins. Jake has enough and at Christmas vacation he decides not to go back. When talking to his dad one day, Jake decides to go back to the navy. ..."
3,Annapo,"Kind of dark, but good...needed better music. Good character development, but not good ideals for young men who want to fight to prove their manhood."
2,"Almost worth a view, but definitely not a purchase.","I purchased this title as part of the Amazon ""Buy One Get One Free"" offer on Blu-ray titles last month. I needed to pick up an extra disc, since there were only three I wanted, so I grabbed this.This movie was mediocre at best. It never really drew me in. In fact, I'd say it was borderline a waste of time. It's really a rip-off of ""An Officer and a Gentleman"", as well as about every 3rd low-budget boxing movie that has come out in the past few years.If I were in the Navy, I would probably be afraid people in the other services would laugh at me because of it.Pass on purchasing this one. Rent only if really bored, and you've seen everything else on the shelf."
3,A boxing flick; Annapolis is also in there somewhere,"This is really a boxing flick, although there is a sub-plot in there somewhere about a bunch of young people trying to make it through their first year of Annapolis. The Naval Academy, along with West Point and the Air Force Academy, is well-known for its hazing and tough first year. The protagonist of this one is a rough-cut young man with an aptitude for boxing. The plot really focuses on his shot at the Academy boxing championship. The result of all of this is that the plot, if there is one, is confused because this film never really decides what it wants to be about: surviving the first year of Annapolis, or boxing.A watchable movie but not what I was expecting. RJB."
4,Annapolis,I received my movie before the due date and it came in great condition I had great service to receive my video.

2,Rocky plus An Officer and a Gentleman,"Don't get me wrong. I liked both films, just don't think they make that good of combination, particularly if neither of the plotlines is that well developed.Story in brief: Jason Huard (James Franco) made a promise to his Mom before she died that he'd go to Annapolis. He didn't quite fit in, but persistence pays off--particularly if you ask your Congressman 34 times for a recommendation.Once he gets into Annapolis, it seems the one thing Huard has going for him is his ability to box. Whether that will keep him in the school remains to be seen.If you liked ""Rocky"" and ""Officer"", you might like this film, but there's neither enough boxing or military training and discipline in the story to make it truly stand out.Rebecca Kyle, January 2009"
2,Lousy Movie,"Annapolis is nothing more than a cheap, cheesy, poorly-acted ripoff of an Officer and a Gentleman with a little bit of Top Gun sprinkled into it.The movie has the feel of an after school special or a failing TV series. The acting is bad and the story is hackneyed. Don't the participants realize how bad the movie is when they're making it?The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because the cinemaphotography was good. That's about the only nice thing I can say about this dud!"
1,umm,the guy is selling a gun that you could build yourself you can get a better gun for the same price
1,sucks!,just do not buy this gun the bb goes 10 feet and falls to the ground you prob dont care but its a really sucky gun!
3,Great stuff - BUT,"Great stuff - BUT (and spare me the complaints about reviewing something other than the product itself) it's available for a FRACTION of this price at many grocery and drug stores.There are cheaper sources on Amazon (closer to the store prices) but they want to $4.00 + for shipping, making it, again, about twice the price it sells for in stores.Unless getting to the store is a real problem, this is not a good deal at all."
2,"it's ok, not what I thought","Ok CD was expecting something else, but not a bad purchase for having a good salsa collection"
3,A spooky mystery in Fossil Glen,"Allie Nichols has an active imagintion.When she tells people like Karen about the ghost they don't believe her.The voice did save her, but what did it want from Allie? I would highly recommend this book to anyone. It was a fabulous, suspenseful ghost story. By Jackie"
1,This is for kids? Subject matter inappropriate for children,"This author can certainly write - it's just a shame she wastes her talent on dreadful subject matter. When did the murder of a young girl by her mother's boyfriend become good subject matter for children? Also - this book includes hauntings, channeling, and a dream sequence that describes in detail how the young girl is strangled and thrown off a cliff. Definately not what I want in my kids' heads!"
1,Dreadful - parents be warned !,"Despite its title, this book has nothing whatever to do with fossils and could have been set virtually anywhere that a ten year old can be killed by her mother's boyfriend. There are many storyline problems, but the worst aspect of this book is that it it takes for granted that parents don't mind their children reading stories about child killers - okay so, the guy gets killed by the ghost, but not before he attempts to kill another child - is this edifying in any way? What's wrong with children's publishing? Don't you want your child reading about something beside greed, corruption and murder? Awful"
4,Allie's Big Problem,Why is she haunting Allie? A girl named Allie is pursued by a ghost.Her friends are giving her problems at the same time.And she keeps hearing voices that guided her down the Glen instead of to her death. But she doesn't know who the ghost is. Also why did it pick her? Read this book and watch the questions unravel.Written by Ashley
4,On the Edge,"I read this book to my third grade students every year in the spring. They absolutely love it. It is full of suspense and mystery, which keeps them hooked. They beg me every day to read more. I find them checking it out of the library and buying it to add to their collection. It keeps their imaginations working and their minds active."
4,Excellent book - for older kids,"I read this because it was the book my son selected from the 6th grade reading list. It was an excellent book - successfully combining elements of 6th grade life with an extraordinary unusual experience. However I think maybe 5th grade is about the youngest I would recommend it for. The way the ghost had met her end and the subsequent threat to the story's heroine are disturbing. I liked the way the story dealt with the 'friends', the Machiavellian life of the average 6th / 7th grader - but without making this the main focus of the story."
5,"Exciting, Adventures, and SPOOOOKY",The main Character Allie is hereing voices and she does not know who it is and why they are contacting here. And you will have to read the book to find out.I could not put the book down because it was so good. This is from Texas.You will not regret reading this book.
5,This is a totally enthralling book.,"This book is absolutely wonderful. Children will enjoy the suspense and drama. From the opening page until the final paragraph, children will anxiously read to find out what is going to happen. I enjoyed reading this page turner that kids will find exciting to read and talk about. Of course, if you don't like a little mystery, then this book isn't for you. The action takes place quickly and DeFelice also adds a little moral story into the plot. Two thumbs up!!!"
5,The Ghost of Fossil Glen,"Allie was with her class on a field trip at the glen and Mr. Henry took his dog with them, the class had to watch the dog so she wouldent get in to anything. when the dog started to go around the glen on the other side of the hill.Hoover, the dog,was digging in one area when allie told her to stop, Hoover was pulling on something then droped it in frount of allies feet when she picked it up she noticed it was the clothes lucy stilles was wearing the night she died. Then Hoover got one of the bones and dropped it, Allie heard something when she tured around she saw Mr. Gagney, her chased her around the glaen then allie climed the cliff when Gagney went to get her he screamed ""no your dead"" then he fell, and died."
5,The Ghost Of Fossil Glen,"I like this book because i love mystery books. I also, like this book because the sequence of the book is one step to anthor. I guess i like the author Cynthia C. Defelice. I never heard of this author until know. I like she should make a part two for the ghost of fossil glen. If she already has one out e-mail me the name of the book. Why don't you just send me a list of all her books from grade 5 and up. I am so glad i read this book. I love it."
2,"Strong concept, disappointing storytelling","What started as a wonderfully inventive work went downhill after about the halfway point. Too many plot points depended on one character overhearing something important. I finished the book a week ago and while I remember the characters and the situations, I can't recall what happened at the end. That says something."
2,"Unsatisfying, unoriginal","This is a well-written post-apocalyptic coming-of-age story. As such, it had nothing I haven't read a dozen times and offered nothing new. The main character was engaging, but that was not enough to justify my attention.The most intriguing part of the book was the concept of the attack that destroyed America. The idea was quite incredible on the face of it, and I was hoping and expecting either a justification or further explanation. Without that further information, I felt as if I had read a ""whodunit"" that never told me who the murderer was!I have NO urge to read the other 2 books in the Tryptich."
4,Very well written !,"Equal parts ""Eternity Road"" and ""The World Made By Hand"" , this post-apocalyptic novel is more a coming of age sci-fi novel..quite a unique genre. It is 2047 and we are being closely guarded and monitored by the Japanese who blew us to smithereens 60 years ago.Unable to tell what has happened to the rest of the world, let alone the US, the residents of San Onfre Valley in California lead a meager existence resembling the pioneer age. Some of the residents are approached by residents of San Diego to try to partner with them in staging a coup against the Japanese. While it did have some boring spots as far as describing the beautiful landscape of California, it was altogether intriguing. This was written during the Cold War so it could very well have been dated, but it wasn't. Apparently there are two companion novels to go along with this one that I will read next. I highly recommend this book."
4,Very very memorable,"I bought this book on sale when I was fourteen. I was intrigued by the possibilities of the storyline - boy saves postapocalyptic America - and I knew KSR had written famous books.I must admit that, at the time, I was a little disappointed. This is not an adventure story at all. However, the fictional society in which these characters live really sticks with you. This is a book that it is really pleasurable to read.Admittedly there are flaws in execution - such as the shootout towards the end, some long dull passages etc - which is why I give it a 4. But this is really memorable stuff."
5,An essential expose of the Warren Commission,"This book is one of the core books on the JFK assassination, extremely useful to me when I was writingImpossible: The Case Against Lee Harvey Oswald (Volume One). One of the things which I learned in the process of writing my book was that the Warren Commission was absolutely necessary to manufacture the utterly phony case against Lee Harvey Oswald, creating a snowstorm of mostly irrelevant evidence, often inaccurate, and sometimes manufactured, spread out over 26 volumes of testimony and exhibits. This snowstorm is the ultimate bluff, because who is going to read these twenty-six volumes, and it is in fact these tens of thousands of pages which have intimidated people and prevented them from discovering the truth. But don't be fooled.The Warren Commission is the missing piece, and the ultimate book on their treasonous work, WARRENGATE, has yet to be written. But this one, and mine, will do for now."
4,"Smooth, rather bland interpretation from the young F-D","I admire Mr. Bryson's opinions, but he's a bit off on this one. F-D made multiple versions of Schubert's great Schwanengesang, and I'm baffled why EMI calls this a Great Recording of the Century--they have another, better version from him in stereo in their Legends series. It's more mature and sitinctive in every respect than this ealier one in mono from the mid-Fifties.Mr. Bryson says that the younger F-D was critcized for over-emphasis, but actually this habit cropped up late in his career. Her he is too smooth and bland, if anything. For lieder afficianados, this version sounds like imitation Gerard Husch and his honeyed baritone. When F-D matured, he began to bark and over-dramatize, but at least that was his true self. Personally, I would call his Legends rendition his veyr best and one of the high points in his distinguished career as a Schubert singer."
3,Old School Computing,"While the book was writed in the 1960s, many of the facts remain true. Computer Organization deals primarily with the nuts and bolts of the hardware and how circuitry works. Difficulties arose when the author talks about long since past data storage punch cards and the old IBM machines. FORTRAN is used as the 'familiar' language for many examples, which becomes slightly confusing to new generation OOP programmers. There's more than likely a better book about Computer Organization utilizing newer concepts, terminology and programming, but this makes for a good read into the history of computers."
5,My grandson loved this little book!,"Fun little book for toddlers. Cute and interesting, and helps with small-motor skills, too. And, of course, they love to eat the Cheerios when they get to the last page!"
5,A Nice Treat For Toddlers!!!,"This book is a special treat for my toddler. It is very bright and colorful and pretty short. It emphasizes counting and eating cheerios, LOL.My daughter loves to get this book out a million times a day so I will go get some cheerios. I have had to start putting it up after reading it twice, or she will just want to read it all day long and the eat the cheerios that go along with it too!A neat book that you are sure to get alot of use out of!"
5,GREAT!!! GREAT!!! GREAT!!!,This is a great movie. I absalutly LOVE Scooby-Doo. The best episode on this DVD is Rholler Ghoster Ride. But I'ts Green I'ts Mean It's the Mystery Machine is cool cos it unlocks the secret of the Mystery Machine's past. I say buy it and ENJOY!!
5,very pleased,Had this for a while now and used it a lot. It is as good as a new one. But be warned I have had many re-manufactured items go bad fast.
1,Wrong book,This company sent the wrong book inside the cover of the book I ordered. The review will not let me put negative stars or no star.
2,Big but less than useful,"There is a lot of info in this book, but I live in Washington and it only had info on 2 schools. A much better book is Peterson's Colleges for Students with Learning Disabilities or ADD. It separates into 2 & 4 year schools and also direct or self-directed programs. The purpose of these books should be to give you some direction as to which schools have something, and ways to contact them for more info. Tons of data about fewer schools is not that helpful, which is how I see this book. All of these books would be even more useful if they included a CD or online search capability so you didn't have to try to scour thru a large written book."
2,Difficult to deal with,"When I saw how difficult the can is to open and close and the smell it gives off when open, I wished that I had ordered the tubes.The product itself is great and I have used it before in a tube. It's the can that spoils it."
3,Simichrome purchase,"I have used Simichrome to polish silver in the past so I know that it is a quality product. The disappointment came when I open the can it was more than half empty, especially given the hefty price. It didn't look used, it just looked empty. The can says ""filled by weight"" but I have no way of weighing 8.82 oz. I ended up using it anyway because I really needed it at that moment but I'm not sure why the quantity was lacking. Maybe I just got a bum batch? I have bought this size can in the past and it was more full when I opened it. Note on my rating: The product itself is five stars, but the quantity was only one star so my rating is an average and should be taken in context."
5,Great Product!,"Simichrome is simple the BEST product of it's type.I have used it for over 30 years.I am very pleased with the price I paid and the service/delivery time I recieved. Thank you, Steffan"
5,Simply the best for brass,I have been polishing a LOT of brass pieces by hand for over 25 years and this is simply the best brass polish there is. What you will quickly discover is that a very little goes a LONG LONG way and that the quality of the brass and the cloths you use will determine to a large degree the quality of the end result. Its not the fault of the polish if the brass is cheap and you use a rough stiff cloth. Old flannel cloth works the best for the final buff.
5,FANTASTIC CD SCRATCH REMOVER!!!!!!,Im a professional singer and sing from music CD's and my CD's were getting to be like real bad and skipped like crazy from over use-SIMICHROME SAVED THE DAY! Simichrome stopped all my CD's from skipping and has given me years more use out them before I have to replace them-THANK YOU SIMICHROME-YOUR THE BEST!!!
1,A Major P.O.C.,"If you don't mind spilling half or more of your used oil on the garage floor, this product is the one for you! The large diameter lid is great during the draining process, but makes a poor seal and falls off when you tip it up to drain out of the small plug. Truly an item that needs a little more careful design."
1,cheap design,"the idea of a large drain opening with cap covering entire drain opening is great, but when the product is tipped over, oil leaks out the large drain cap, and also starting with during the draining process, oil leaks out of the cheap little side drain cap (the drain cap easily is overtightend - never makes a good seal). the world needs a high quality version of this desgin."
1,This is GARBAGE,"wow... where to begin.As mentioned in the other reviews, this LEAKS... which is not what you want when dealing with 5+ quarts of oil... it's a PITA to clean up afterwards.Draining this is stupid too.. MOST oil pans are TAPERED so that when you drain it the oil goes down a little channel so MOST if not all of the oil is gone... not this. It's just a hole that is in the side (topped with a screw cap that does NOT stay tight and also leaks) So you are forced to move the entire container around to get that extra half cup of oil OUT of the pan and then what happens is you get dripps and leaks from the top center larger portion of the lid...this is absolute garbage... I can't understand who thought this was a great idea to make but obviously they failed as engineers making this thing..."
1,Leaks all over your garage floor,"Do not buy under any circumstances. Oil leaks out of both caps, a huge unexpected mess. I can't believe they even sell this thing."
3,It's rather small and leaks,This drain pan is a little bit small to drain into without getting oil everywhere. The drain plug also leaked on my first use.
1,Spout cap cracks and leaks. What a mess...,"The spout cap (green in my case) developed a crack which opened during just the 2nd oil change I was doing with this pan and oil started leaking, creating huge mess... It's a good design, but the quality is unacceptable... C'mon, the cap can be made stronger not to crack in 21st century..."
1,Junk,"The large cap and small cap both leak like crazy. Viton O-rings would make these serviceable, but as they are, they're terrible."
2,"Great design, poor execution",I had one of these for several years. It worked OK at first. The top still leaked a little. Now the top pops off if you tighen just a little too much. The screen it the top keep falling through the opening. I wish someone would take this concept and create a truelly good version. Time to replace this one.
4,"Many hate it, but I like it","This drain pan has many bad reviews written about it but it is useful in certain applications. I would never use this drain pan to change the oil on a automobile or truck, I have a much larger drain pan that works for that purpose. This small drain pan is good for small engines. My brother likes to use this drain pan on his motorcyle because is fits under the bike, unlike some drain pans intended for automobiles which are much too tall. I like to use it to drain my oil filters because it is small and doesn't take up much floor space. The grating on top prevents oil from getting trapped under the oil filter while draining, unlike in my other pans. It works very well for these two uses."
2,Concern from internet search on product,"I bought this and planned on programing it for a replacement.However, after doing a more detailed internet search I found more than one posting of issues this this product that may reset the locks such that the OEM mate to this may not work and the locks on the car may no longer work. So have not used it.If someone has bought this and used it (with no issues) with a OEM mate please post.So I am not sure if this works or not and do not want to try it given the bad internet posts."
5,stunning,this is a fantastic bluegrass/jazz hybrid with top musicians. i never tire of this album. it could not be better.
2,Nothing but trouble,"I have read many reviews saying how good this item is, but I must disagree. I installed it perfectly out of the box and it ran fine. Then I ran the update software and it updated the software but would not display video anymore. Now I cannot install it at all, assuming that the software update flashed the gateway and the old drivers don't know what it is anymore. Anytime I try to install the drivers, I get 'does not contain information about your device'. I even went as far as formatting my drives and ground up installing XP. I called both 24/7 support #s and both went to voicemail, one a general mailbox. If you need support, good luck. I gave it 2 stars because it did work for a day and it looks nice. Whoopidy doo."
2,Using a Video Monitor w/o PC,"I just bought one of the starter systems with the controller and one wireless camera. All I really wanted was a camera at the back of my garage that could allow me to monitor what's going on from inside the house on a permanently attached video display (no PC). I got it set up and working (I think), so I can see the pictures thru the PC (laptop) software on the PC display when the controller is attached to the PC via USB. What I really want is to have a separate (cheap) monitor atatched to the video output on the MZE1000 controller so I see the picture continuously but NOT have the PC hooked up all the time. Is this possible and how do I do it? I saw some doc soemwhere that said the default output for the video out is the image from wired camera 1 if the PC software is inactive..any way to make this work with the wireless camera.The sales guy at the discount electronics store told me I could, but don't think he really knew."
3,Good solid cheap system,I have had this system for over a year now and was very happy with it. It had it limitations such as not very good in low light but was fixed by purchasing a infrared lamp. The software is fair but lacks the ability to integrate outside of Motorola HW.Updates are easy to find on the Motorola website and are free to download. This system integrates and works with the Motorola Homesight system.Pro's:Easy to setupGood distance for wirelessCon's:Doesn't work with non-motorola hardwareBroad use of the 2.4Ghz spectrum.
1,Too bad I can't rate it 0 stars!,"Do NOT waste your money on this trash!!! Words cannot even begin to describe my frustration with this product, and with Motorola's technical support for this either. I've installed multi-thousand dollar security systems with no real problems before, but this cheap piece of trash is nothing other than that - trash."
1,Never Works,"This had the potential to be useful but failed. the software is terrible, and the wireless sensors go about 30 feet max. Terrible time installing the software, once it is working its very limited and slow. The sensors lose contact all the time and the cameras are bad."
3,meh,I like the machine but there's just two issues I had.First and my biggest problem is that this machine does not have a cooling unit where the ice falls so if you don't get rid of the snow cones right away then the ice will melt. So you have to crush the ice only when you want one and cant crush it ahead of time to make extra. If I had known this before hand then I wouldn't have bought it.My second problem was that the machine does NOT do shaved ice. We removed the cutter assembly and moved the blades as close as they would go and we still got big chunks of ice. My father ended up adding a nut behind the blade to make the space for the ice to fall through smaller.Otherwise the machine is really good but I wouldn't suggest it for big things like a fair but for parties and bbq's its great!
5,Excellent product & service,Framed movie posters arrived in only 3 days after ordering and in excellent packinging. The posters and framing exceeded my expectations. First-class operation!
5,Comparative Librarianship Resource,"This is a great title for the study of the areas of comparing libraries, libararianship and library worlds."
3,ANGEL FACE,"ALL THE YEARS OPENING FOR JOHNNY WINTER HASNT HURT, SOUNDS AND PLAYS JUSR LIKE JOHNNY WINTER,SONG IS A BLUESY NATIONAL SLIDE GUITAR TUNE,IF YOU LIKE JOHNNY WINTER YOU WILL LIKE THIS SOUND AND I BET IF YOU DIDNT KNOW ERIC SARDINAS IS PLAYING AND SINGING YOU WOULKD THINK ITS JOHNNY"
4,"Not what I expected, but cool nonetheless...","I don't know WHY I expected this to be more rubbery, like a Gumby figurine, but I did. Anyway, this served its purpose. I would suggest one be delicate with it. Just because it's made of metal, doesn't mean parts of it can't come off. I'm especially worried about the beer bottle and the antenna because they look like if you dropped the Bender figurine, those'd be the first to go.Unrelated matter, the sticker on the bottle keeps coming off. Might need glue.Recommended use: desk decorations... I take mine everywhere but that's because I feel like if I leave mine at the desk, it'll be swiped."
5,Fantastic Buy,"Well, as I'm already a fan of the show, I really am happy with this ""action figure"". It's really heavy and stable. It's staying with me as long as I live. I even brought Bender with me on a road trip and since he's metal, he didn't get squashed."
4,good remixes,i really don't know the tracks here but the cover looks a lot like the us's maxisingle doesn't it and i suppose it has the same tracks so i really like the remixes there especially breadown and the roof.
4,Good Salvation message,"This book was the first that I have read by Al/Joanna Lacy. Growing up in Washington, I am always interested in stories about the Oregon Trail. This book had likeable characters, a great message, and surprising accuracy about life and scenery on the Oregon Trail."
2,Missa solemnis,"At the risk of sounding like a philistine, nothing of Beethoven's ""Missa Solemnis"" moves me. I purchased it after having read it praised by KR Jamison in her excellent book, ""Exuberance,"" and reading that Beethoven considered it his best work. Unlike Bach's ""St. Matthew Passion"" and ""Magnificat,"" or Vivaldi's ""Gloria,"" I found none of the movements melodic. Given all the great music Beethoven composed, I would rank Missa rather low. Perhaps my taste may mature as I enter my 60s and may look back on this review with chagrin."
5,Unprecedented Majesty and Grandeur,"This is the third recording of Missa Solemnis that I have heard. The first two (Karajan and Gardiner) were excellent. Nevertheless, I was totally unprepared for the emotion, grandeur and majesty of the Klemperer recording. I own nearly 1,000 classical CDs, and I feel strongly that this is the most powerful and truly moving CD in my collection. I will leave the analysis of the merits of the singing, conducting, orchestral playing and sound engineering to others. I prefer to keep listening to this reverential music without indulging in dissecting its component parts. The overall experience is simply too awe inspiring for me."
4,Build your own sheep,"A good book for people who wish theyr own equipment. Good drawings and plans.If you wish to learn spining and weaving, and prefer to buy your tools, thenyou can find better books.Add one or more tags for this product"
5,Excellent Economically Priced Feeder,"I bought two of these feeders over 6 years ago. Both of them held up very well. We have House Sparrows, House Finches, Mocking Birds, Scrub Jays and one Northern Flicker that visit the feeders. The feeders have had no problem holding the heavier birds. The summers here in the desert area of Southern California can be very hot. These feeders have stood up the the elements just fine, although the red has faded a bit, but otherwise they've done well. Until last fall, when we had some extremely strong Santa Ana winds that blew one of the feeders out of the tree. It hit the edge of the cement walkway and cracked. My husband wrapped some string around it a couple of times and the crack was ""repaired"". I bought one more about a year ago and I'm planning on buying a couple more as replacements....in case of wind ;-)"
1,Bird feeder,"It is made of plastic with small plastic perches. Difficult for larger birds. For the money, it was worth it."
1,A Sadistic mess,Avoid this low budget trash. Mostly about torture and heroin. The cover art is the only good thing about this movie.
4,Glad I found this,"Both CDs are now in my posession and I use them during my Reiki sessions, it really helps with the energy, it comes in stronger then when I play regular spa type music. So for me this was the best music purchase I have made to use during my Reiki sessions, it also relaxes the client more, they feel more relaxed after a session.Thank you Steve Murray for a great product, I feel this was well worth my money."
4,Not a bad representation!,"My only issue with the soundtrack (yes I have the DVD too) is why did they leave the narrative from the documentary over the music in the soundtrack? My copy came as a promo and not sure if this detail was fixed before the retail version came out or not. I agree with others, excellent soundtrack, could have been longer and definitely missed a few of the gems that are in the DVD."
5,This is something SPEEEEECIAL....life is something speeecial...,"What a mix!!.......... I was hesitant to pay the extra $$$ for this mix since I already had the O.G. Maestro Soundtrack, but come on..... the ""Danny Krivit stamp of approval"" kept itching me to pick up this double disc mix, so eventually I finally went for it. .....RESULTS: Classic after classic after classic TUNE!...... and in much better sound quality than the single disc.I'm not taking anything away from the single disc too, as they both have different songs (and exerts from the film), but I'm just vibing off this one more!!..... GREAT STUFF!"
4,Four stars for NYC Peech Boys alone!,"Sure the sound quality ain't great, but the track selection of this CD is spot-on, eschewing the more obvious choices to feature some truly underground, much-sought-after tracks, especially the first-ever-on-CD inclusion of the full version of NYC PEECH BOYS' stunning proto-garage track ""LIFE IS SOMETHING SPECIAL"" - you've heard it sampled countless times on other house tracks, now revel in the orignal's majesty. NOW I wish Island/4th&Broadway would see fit to re-issue ALL the ""lost"" NYC Peech Boys tracks on a CD compilation - Chris Blackwell, can you feel me?!"
3,NYC old skool Clubbing!,"It's not simple to do a soundtrack on a film that's a documentary of an underground music movement!Good stuff on it, but maybe a double cd complation could have been better!Len"
4,A Little Stiff,"I finally saw this album sitting on a shelf and said 'oh what the hell, it'll take it. On this live preformance the group is starting to gel with each other. Some of the songs in the beginning are a little weak and there are some noticiable screw-ups mostly by the newly added Jenkins who even forgets parts on his own compositions. But Hopper and Marshall really shine through with driving rhythms. Ratalege also does a fine job covering tasteful solos. Highlights include:'Slightly All The Time', 'Drop','Stumble' and 'Gesolreut'."
5,The Man in Black AND Roscoe Holcomb!,"Wow. It's sweet to see Pete Seeger's well-meaning homespun folksy show, but his guests always steal the show. Here we have Johnny Cash and June Carter in the 60's. Johnny is skinny and jittery as a June Bug--might be the speed and booze. The minute Johnny tears into a song however, he's calm and collected with driving energy. Absolutely amazing performance. Even June sings a song here. That's not all, Roscoe Holcomb sings with a high-lonesome voice that was stolen from the ghosts of Appalachia. He plays guitar and banjo with such power and force, singing with a voice that'd raise the hairs on the back of your neck all the while chewing gum. A nice slice of the best. Thanks to Pete Seeger."
1,Misleading DVD Title,"Where is Johnny Cash in this dvd ???? How could anyone mistake the Stanley Brothers for The Great Singer,Songwriter and Music Artist Johnny Cash ????"
1,Had to Cancel My Order,"I ordered a Hubble Deep Field Poster from Direct 4 Sale on December 4, 2007. On the item description it stated ""Shipping estimate for these items: December 6, 2007 - December 7, 2007"". On December 13th, Amazon notified me that they did not know when the item would ship and that they would not charge my account until it did. They suggested that I contact Direct 4 Sale for further information. I did just that. Direct 4 Sale responded that my item would ship on December 24, 2007. Since I wanted this item for Christmas, I cancelled my order. I then ordered the same item from another vendor. Since it is so close to Christmas now, I had to pay expedited shipping charges. I will never buy from Direct 4 Sale again.Mary Calcagno"
2,Average at best!,"I thought this is a great deal for a suede tote, but the low price comes with low quality. The handles are attached badly, and mine broke after a month of intermittent use.I would not recommend this product!"
5,Good Product,"This is a clean, very light-weight burner. It is very easy to load and unload the butane cannisters, and the automatic lighter works reliably and easily. My only quibble would be that it's difficult to turn the flame quite as low as might be desirable."
4,Cooks Great,"We ordered this cooktop in preparation for a trip to Disney and we were staying in a place that had no stove. This was the perfect solution for making small meals for the kids. It worked fantastic. Started beautifully and was very simple to use. The only thing keeping it from being a 5 on the rating was that the manufacturer seems to have a little problem getting the actually cooking top to sit level. I had to bend the lip underneath to keep it from wobbling. Cooking.com replaced the unit without any problems and the replacement unit seems to have the same issue, just not as bad. We'll keep it and use it modified."
5,exactly what I wanted,"This is a good product. Durable and dependable. Its good for camping, emergencies, or as a warmer. Everyone needs one of these."
4,Butane stove,"Should come with the recommended propane canisters, or at least state they are required for use."
5,great little camp stove burner,"I've tried other types of table-top burners, but my Max Burton table top burner is the best and easiest to use! It comes along on all camping trips and is easy to light, produces a strong, consistent, variable strength flame, feels nice and solid so it can support heavy or awkward pans/skillets, and is easy to unpack and transport. In earthquake country, it's a good idea to keep one of these units stashed away with some extra canisters ""just in case"" :)"
2,doesn't fit over new style switches,"Too bad that this does not fit over new style switches, common to many homes."
5,solid medical and csi type thriller,"Dr Mark Sloan is dodging bullets (on rollerskates) after he decides to re-open some serial killer cases, noticing something fishy in the crime scene photos. Meanwhile back at the hospital, a lawsuit is in process after a patient dies during a kidney transplant. But was it malpractice or murder? Only Mark's keen brain can disect the clues and get to the bottom of both cases.A very enjoyable book. I highly recommend it."
5,Northern Country,This is one of the most incredible singers I have managed to stumble across. It seems so unfair. She has incredible range and clarity. Just listen to dreamers If you get a chance.
1,"Brilliant production, abysmal quality DVD","This is a stunning performance, however the quality of this Kultur release DVD is absolutely abysmal. The colours are very dark and murky, nothing at all like the photos on the cover. Others write that the TDK version has better colours, as well as more subtitle languages (this Kultur version only has English), and also interviews with the production crew. I've had to buy two copies then, because the opera is so wonderful it deserves to be seen in its full glory. I highly recommend if you would like this video, buy the TDK version (available from amazon.co.uk) instead!!"
2,I promise myself NOT TO BUY kultur label dvd again.,"The worst presentation of a dvd opera: no synopsis, subtitles just in english, no extras, no artist information,no opera gerneralites.I was waiting for an interview of Minkowsky drescribing the most exiting momentes of the opera....i will have to go back to youtube....."
2,"I like ""Les Indes Galantes "" better",18th century opera dressed in 20th century clothe not my cup of tea.
5,all that and a can of coke!,"First of all, I want to say I'm very proud of Litefoot; ""Puttin' it down for Natives"". I've been in hip hop for fifteen years. In this era of gangsta rap, Litefoot is positive and refreshing. Tribalistic Funk; Native rap with a west coast flavor. The collaboration with Kid Frost and other Latino rappers not only produced some ""fat sounds!"", it also shows the conection that Natives and Latinos have from our past to the future. To the non-Native people, this album shows a lil' insight and good music on Inden life. My favorite song is ""Indian summer days"". It reminds me of being back in Pine Ridge on the REZ. To all you young Natives, go and find this CD! It's definately worth it. Representin' REZ LIFE in Lawrence, Kansas. LAKOTA DOWN."
2,Litefoot is cute but he also thinks hes cute as well,"this native man needs to respect women alittle more in his songs and realize that were more than just pretty natives.He's coming out cool in his lyrics if you sweat that ""G"" stuff its kind of old to me but then I'm from the old school.We need to drag him back to his roots and give him a little refresher course in respect,and what you sing about can also effect the way we act and also treat others as well.INDIAN WORLD.Portland Oregon!"
3,"Boilerplate McInerney, with some added pages this time","Last of the Savages was perhaps the best book on friendship I have read to date. Bright Lights, Big City was an honest tour de force that I read in a day. Hell, even Story of My Life was fraught with the sort of car accident quality that got it read in three days.And here in Brightness Falls, Jay McInerney loses only a smidge of his page-turning quality. However, it seems that so much of the book is just left over anxiety of class struggle and obsession with cash and cache. The obligatory 1980s rehab scene and trite getting-clean-and-watching-the-sunset tableau is without the honesty that let it work in Mac's first novel.It's a good read, but it's not all that and a bag of Cheetos. We'll see what Jay gives us when he lets go of the 80s."
3,Improvement?,"This is the only McInerney book I haven't read and it's pretty intimidating--I'm about 50 pages through and am rather bored, does it get any better?"
4,The demise of a pawn in a corporate raid,"With little of the incoherence or mawkishness that marked ""Ransom"", but also little of the levity that graced ""Bright Lights, Big City"", the novel relates a failed junk-bond-takeover of a New York publishing house, in which the protagonist, a minor editor in this company, is a key figure ... and is left out in the rain. Apart from the rather strong dose of morality dealt out towards the end, a compelling read. As usual, McInerney is good at making his characters act and think like real human beings. However, certain aspects are best overlooked, the socialite wife helping victims of a raided crack-house, the corporate raider who is married to a transsexual, the junkie friend ... these seem to be added for effect rather than any reason related to the story's plot."
5,Beautifully written,"This is a beautifullly written book. A little slow to get started, but a nice more recent story than his other books. Nice snapshot of the era. Feels kind of dated now, with the Dow Jones at 11000."
5,Silica Gel seems to be keeping it dry,"Use the gel in our strong box after we had found moisture in it. I figure the paper had soaked in the humid air or we licked the envelopes to much. anyway, I Checked it after a month of use and the inside was dry but the indicator said I needed to dry out the silica gel by just placing in an oven for a couple of minutes. Well worth it."
2,nothappy,I received the watch today and it was not in new condition. The packing material had been reused indicating a returned watch. The documentation says it is a diver's watch but the crown does not lock and the second hand does not stop when the crow is pulled out to set the time. If the watch is truly water resistant to 100 M the crown should lock. I will send it in for repair but I am not a happy camper.
2,Not for serious pizza cooks,"This book is a collection of recipes for weird pizzas, but offers little detail on how to make good pizza. The dough recipes are over-simplified and wrong, omitting much of the critical detail required to make excellent pizza dough. They tell you to let it rise for one hour (wrong; it should be refrigerated overnight), to roll it out with a rolling pin (wrong; it should be hand-stretched), and to bake at 425 degrees (wrong; it should be baked on a stone pre-heated at 550 degrees). If it never occurred to you that you can put barbecue chicken, kiwi fruit, chocolate (yuck) or cilantro (retch) on a pizza, this book is for you (the recipe for red, green, and yellow pepper pizza borders on silly - who knew that you can put bell peppers on a pizza, let alone THREE different colors!). But if you want a book showing how to make GOOD pizza (this book has no pictures) instead of weird pizza, look elsewhere."
1,30 best pizzas in the world,"Grotesquely dissapointing has a permanment address in the community of white trash cookery, belicose trash"
1,"Help Me, Eros","This movie is 90 minutes of boring, pornographic nihilism pretending to be something more. Keep moving, folks. Nothing to see here."
3,Arrived today..,"First of all the way the post office packaged it was aweful, nothing around the broom at all to protect it..Second i had to hot glue it because it was coming apart when i took it out of the box, probably due to the roughness inside an un-bubblewrapped box.Other than those issues, and now that i fixed it.. it's o.k."
4,This are great but not as durable as I would like.,"This look and feel great, but not as durable as I would like.-This can be used over and over again for a couple of days if needed and won't smell. These can be helpful for those long travel/excursions one might go on.- After about three months I started to notice that the fabric began to disintegrate in some parts, so while the fabric is not very durable, they are still very comfortable and useful.-One more thing, these are made in China."
4,Nice Quality,Nothing too exciting to write but these are very comfy and good quality. Better than the Jokey equivalent by far.
4,Good...but expensive!,"As the title says, these boxer shorts are good, but expensive. I use them, along with an ExOfficio vee neck shirt for pajamas on trips. They fit well, wash well, and dry overnight, as advertised. ExOfficio items are light and very packable."
4,great just not in white,"Great underwear, I only wish I could afford more than the 3 pair I have. They prevent chaffing, wick well and are very comfortable to wear. The white ones however get gray between the crotch region from sweat, and this only comes out with a machine wash so you cannot hand wash these only unless you don't mind a little grey in your white briefs."
2,Inseams irritate the inside of my legs,"I really like my exOfficio boxer briefs, but I normally wear cotton boxers so I thought I'd try the exOfficio boxer. Unfortunately, although the boxer's material and seamlines are the same places as the boxer-briefs, the looseness of the boxers means instead of the inner thigh seams hugging my legs, the loose seams now move separately from my leg when I walk and rub the inside of my thigh. This seam issue is not present on my cotton boxers because the only seam in them runs in a U under the groin, connecting the left and right sides of the boxer.I'm sticking with the boxer briefs."
5,Worth Every Penny,My husband and my son both got a pair for our Europe trip and they loved it! It is totally worth the money and it does dry very quickly!
5,The best travel underwear ever,"I have three pairs of these that I use when I go on vacation. They are light, soft, comfortable and keep me dry through long days of trudging through the Yucatan or the Louvre. The will NOT however dry overnight. I wash them out at night, hang them to dry and in about 24 hours they are ready. Thats why I keep three pairs. They are comfortable enough that I am contemplating buying enough to wear everyday, but the price has so far kept them reserved for travel. Still I cannot recommend them highly enough. I like them much better than the boxer brief which I have had chafing problems with, no such problems with the boxers."
2,ExOfficio Men's Give- NI-Go,The size is misleading. The are a lot larger than the size indicate. I did not wear them. They are too large. I need to return them.
2,Photo misrepresents item,"Photo needs to be changed so it looks like the item I got shipped to me. It looks like a boxer brief in the advertising, but it is in fact a loose fitting boxer short. Disappointed when I opened it and had to ship it back and reorder. Please make this correct for your customers."
5,As good as advertised,My husband bought two pair for camping. He so prefers them to all other briefs that I have made them my birthday and holiday gift of choice. The elastic on his first pair lasted four years of heavy wear. I could not recommend ExOfficio more highly.
3,"They are comfortable, most of the time","You can barely tell you have these on, very light material, stretches so you don't feel them pull when squatting for example.My only complaint is occasionally they will grab an ass hair and not let go. I'm not a very hairy man but a few times a day a hair will get caught and you basically end up pulling the hair out. I guess I'll have baby smooth bottom in a few months."
4,Fantastic,"These are phenomenal but run a half size big. Be careful how you order them. I've worn a medium my whole life and am exchanging them for a small. Surprising...even for me. The small's keep my stuff a little more snug which is why I bought these over the plain boxers. Regardless of having to change sizes, I LOVE them."
5,Absolutely love them,Comfortable and easy to care for. Much more comfortable and durable than tradifional cotton. Bought five pair in various colors.
5,Great product,These Give-N-Go boxers are everything they claim to be. They wick away moisture with ease and perform well. The material is great and very comfortable will definately buy again.
1,not a quick dry,I have travelled with Ex Officio briefs but am looking for other options.I purchased them because I believed they would dry quickly...nottrue since my regular cotton boxers dry faster.so I would notrecommend this product if you desire do do wash on extended trips.They are comfortable but are a pricy option with no significant advantagesfor a traveller.
3,An OK product,it does feel cool before the first wash. but that goes away after several washes.And it is not soft enough like the conventional boxers....
4,Best boxers on the planet,"After wearing these for about a year, I won't wear anything else. Not cheap, but worth 10% worth it. d"
3,Not what I expected and tends to slide on body.,tends to slide on body when wearing it. Material is what it says it is and comfortable. Better then jockey.
2,Size Chart is flawed,"The image on Amazon is deceiving and the size chart is misleading. I have ~33"" waist, so I bought mediums, but I should have gotten small. I basically own very expensive boxers now, instead of the boxer briefs that I desired."
2,looser than picture,"these boxers are loose fitting, not snug like in the picture. i did get another pair that were more form fitting. oddly, both styles are labeled 'Men's give-n-go boxer' but they are fundamentally different. i returned these but kept the snug fitting ones."
1,Not what I thought,"The product had very little discription in the ad, I would not recommend this product to anyone. Do not like it."
4,I'll buy more,Very comfortable. Got tired of the same old kind of boxers etc... so I thought why not try these. So I bought a pair. I liked them so I ordered two more. I will be ordering more very soon. It's the comfort that sold me on these.
5,It's like a golden fleece of comfort...,"but for your balls. Seriously, I balked at the $17ish dollars, but now I have two pairs that I rotate, and won't wear anything else now. Yes, my wife does think I'm crazy.The fit is slightly tighter than expected (at least for me, but I have tree trunk legs). Think loose boxer briefs almost."
4,Husband likes,"Bought for my husband. He was not too eager to wear them at first, but now he likes them and wears them frequently. A little pricy, so probably will not purchase another pair unless they were a bit cheaper."
5,ExOfficio Men's Give-N-Go Boxer,"My husband wanted a pair of breathable lightweight boxers to sleep in, and for hiking/camping. After shopping around, and reading tons of reviews, I got him two pair of these.He really likes them; says they are very comfortable. They are somewhat expensive, but worth it. I hope.If I can find them on sale, I will probably get a few more.When buying, I noticed they made them for women also. I may get myself a pair to sleep in. :)"
3,"Pretty good, but not competitive with the best","I largely agree with Santa Fe listener's review. Chopin's 1st piano concerto should sound spontaneous and dramatic, yet refined and with an easy finesse. It is a little slow and labored here. The music does not quite flow.The rest of the CD is a little better. The nocturnes are solid, if inferior to Rubinstein's recordings. I'm not very familiar with the other two pieces.For the best recording of the piano concerto, I recommend Zimerman's with Giulini."
2,Costume capers,"The costumes in this performance are simply absurd. Several male leads wear outfits that might be found in the military of a small South American dictatorship or on an usher in a 1950s movie theater. Another male singer appears to be in his pajamas in bare feet. Another appears to be a Nazi.The sets, while irritating, can at least be tolerated. The stage director needs to find a new way to make a living.Still, the voices in the production range from good to excellent (the countertenors are especially fine) and the orchestra, while lacking the bounce one would have hoped for, does a creditable job.The earlier Julius Caesar with Janet Baker, Sarah Walker, Della Jones, and Valerie Masterson is in every way a more desirable production."
3,"Handel - Giulio Cesare / Kenny, Pushee, Dalton, Campbell, Gunn, Bennett, Hickox, Sydney Opera","Handel - Giulio Cesare / Kenny, Pushee, Dalton, Campbell, Gunn, Bennett, Hickox, Sydney Opera is an sufficient production by Francisco Negrin. Richard Hicock seems a bit rushed. He could have eased a bit on the pedal and that would have sounded so much better. The problem is the costumes. They look downright cheap. The setting looks like something you would see in a local theatre and not in a major opera production. The sound quality is not amazing. It sounds a bit muted at times. Kenneth Chalmers has written the music notes. Just al-right. 3/5."
5,"A must-have for any ""1776"" fan!","If you enjoyed the movie (or Broadway) version of Sherman Edwards' ""1776,"" this book containing the piano/vocal score to the musical is for you. The music comes alive in ""1776 Vocal Selections"" when you too can sit at your piano and sing as one of the Founders of this country."
3,Fair,"This coloring book can only be called fair. Yes, it is Harry Potter so the children were thrilled. But the scenes picked were not exactly the ones I would have chosen. For example, there was not one of Marge blown up and floating away! Ok, if you are like my children and just wanted the latest Harry Potter coloring book...but I think I'll keep a look out for something better."
5,Hello Red Fox,"The author of Hello Red Fox did a very good job keeping the audiences attention, especially when keeping young childrens attention is hard. He used techniques like involving the reader in the story by staring at a picture with a dot then staring at a blank page and seeing that same object but in a different color. Very cool! Kids love that kind of stuff, so i strongley encourage you to get out and read it with your kids!"
4,Great book for kids that is art related,"This book is great for teaching kids about colors in art. They learn about contrasting colors and color opposites. It would be great for an elementary art classroom or any one who wants to teach young kids about colors. I have read the book many times to groups of kids ranging from 2+ to 7. I've found that age 5+ works the best, since it does require that the kids follow some directions for seeing the contrasting colors. However, this book does not focus on reading."
4,good wheat alternative,Need to get better at adding flavor with ingredients because these have no flavor. Little different to cook as well.
3,Symptom of a statistical approach I dislike,"I find Principal Component Analysis (PCA) a perfectly usable technique that has a place in a statistical toolbox. It is an unfortunate fact that in many applications areas, PCA has become the de-facto Multivatiate Analysis Technique, in some cases even becoming synonymous for that term. In an ideal world, a book like Jackson's would simply not be necessary. If more sophisticated analysis was required to solve a problem, any number of techniques far more powerful than PCA can be brought to bear. However, there is a user community that wants to augment PCA with multiple layers of secondary analysis and interpretation, and this book is for them.Having stated my dislike for the need for this book, I concede that it meets that need quite well. It is written in an approachable manner, presents simple data sets, and is a little bit less math intensive than some of the more general machine learning texts."
3,Not good for finance,"This book is geared toward engineering types, not for people who want to use PCA for stock trading, securities covariance forecasting, etc."
2,A user's Guide to principle components,"I've received this book maybe 3 or 4weeks ago.But I found that there is one problem.The last several pages of that book are torn and folded.I decided not to claim anything...but I want for you to be more careful of your things(products).Anyway, thank you for the delivery.Sincerely yours."
5,CULT LITERATURE,"I study cults such as the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, aka the Jehovah's Witnesses and their own publications are a gold mine when it comes to proving they are false prophets and liars. I am so happy there is such easy access to their literature, through Amazon book sellers."
4,Feeling It,I'm starting to feel Eric Gray's stories. This one was definitely a good read. Classic case of how Black men like myself see what the good and glamorous things money can bring you but then there is the evil side of the money. I was hoping ricky wouldn't fall in the trap but there wouldn't be a story if he didn't . I think he learned his lesson too late. Book was good
4,The outward room,"A very poignant look at mental illness and how things used to be when people were institutionalized. It also makes the reader reflect at today's treatment which doesn't seem to be a whole lot better and often results in overmedicating patients.The book also gives a powerful insight into the resilience of the human spirit. A good read, recommended if you are interested in mental illness"
1,not uncut,this dvd is NOT uncut and is actually shorter than the american release...i was hoping that this was the director's cut from the criterion laserdisc but it is not sadly...
5,Very Well Done. Top Quality.,My family and I really enjoyed the movie and the picture quality. It was just great.
1,It Broke,"The third time I used this spout, it broke into two pieces. I had to fish the spout out of the gas tank and clean up about a half-gallon of spilled gas as a result."
3,Blitz 12020 spout review,Item fits my cam perfectly. But I had to exopy the metal tube on the inside where it attaches to the threaded plug. The spout leaked. Manufacture most not have quality control.
1,LEAKING SPOUT,THE SPOUTS ARE BIG AND NICE LOOKING BUT THE ONE I HAVE LEAKS AROUND THE BOTTOM WHERE THE WELD IS GAS GOES ALL OVER I CAN NOT USE IT SO I HAD TO ORDER A NEW ONE THAT WAS PLASTIC I KNOW THINGS ARE NOT MADE WELL TO DAY BUT GAS COST A LOT I DONOT NEED IT TO GO ON THE GROUND I COULD NOT RECOMEND THIS SPOUT .MY SPOUT WAS MADE ON MONDAY
3,Believe the reviews,"I read the reviews and bought anyway. Well reviews on this are correct. I bought this for my granddaughter for a trip to Florida. We took this with us for first trip to the beach and did not bring back. Unless water is completely still it is impossible to hold and focus in the water.You could not see fish,shells, anything that I had hoped we could.OK as a toy for younger children to carry around. Therefore a less expensive version would suffice."
1,Save your money for the real thing,"Great idea, poor execution. Very difficult to see a thing and keep it in focus, and the lighting function for underwater, which is why I bought it, doesn't really work unless you're in pretty clear water."
2,GeoSafari Seascope,This just does not work. We wanted to use it so anyone of any age could watch the fish in our very clear water pond but it is not really worth it. Sounded like a great concept but very cheaply produced.
2,Beware of the Durability,"I thought this would be a perfect gift for my 5 year old son's birthday. However, it really doesn't work the way it described or pictured. Its a toy, not a waterproofed scope. The lenses leak which then blurrs and distorts vision every time. You can not see anything through it. The magnifications don't work well together either which adds to the distorted vision. He enjoyed it somewhat, but was disappointed that it didn't work.We opened it on vacation in Jamaica and threw the box out which is why I didn't attempt to return it. Great Idea, but doesn't perform."
1,Not pleased,"This toy is a disappointment to say the least. It does not stay together and the flashlight is a joke. I read the reviews and thought I would try it anyway because I have been happy with other GeoSafari toys but the reviews were right on. Wish I could return it, however, you do not know it doesn't work until after you put it in the water..."
2,Not as good as we thought it would be,"We had high hopes for this toys as my son loves to play outside, wade in local streams/creeks and loves anything animal related. We thought he could use this to see the animal life in the creek in our back yard, however it is difficult to even see in the bathtub. Using the toy without the magnifier is a little better but still not great. A cute novelty but wouldn't buy again."
3,Think Twice...,I have seen the sea scope on many other sites at the msrp which is half this price. Just so you know
3,exciting toy,"toy is very excited to think about, but we will see when it gets used. Can't do much with snow right now. Looks like it will not last long, but my daughter was super excited to see it under the tree."
3,Beating a dead horse,"Herr's assessment of Arthur Morgan's attempt to invent a new Antioch college seems obsessed with diminishing the reputation of a man whose accomplishments cannot be denied. He did resurrect a dying college which became enormously successful, the water projects he designed successfully perform perfectly as contrasted to, say, the U.S. Corps of Engineers designs for New Orleans. Morgan never claimed to have invented cooperative education. Morgan did engage the interest and support of leading educational and business leaders of his time includng Eliot of Harvard and Kettering of General Motors and many others. He selected outstanding faculty who guided many to graduate schools and outstanding careers. Surely every public life has its errors and short comings, and Morgan's had his. But he stood far above many in his time and niggling criticisms, which can be met while the man is alive seem petty and useless when he is not here to reply. Paul R. Cooper"
5,does what its supposed to do,basic function however its getting harder and harder to buy american made products. Made in USA very good quality as expected
2,Not my favorite,"I bought this because it was inexpensive and I thought 6 quarts was large enough. Unfortunately I did not think far enough ahead. My truck has 5qt oil capacity, and this container will hold a maximum of 6qts on a flat surface. The walls are very thin, so when you pick it up full, it will bend. Suffice it to say, not a good combination when you are at the brim with oil."
3,So far the best product I've owned by them,"I picked this unit up in addition to one of their closed oil change pans. Overall, this does what it is made to do: Hold Oil! Transferring it to another container can be a pain, but for the price, it gets the job done."
3,"Held a lot, but spilled some","There's not much you can say about its main use: it holds liquids just fine.BUT, the spout is not that well formed, and I spilled some amount of gas when transferring it to the gas can. I'm not a bad pourer either."
5,Absolutely amazing,"Yes, you need to put some elbow grease into it but the results are amazing. Have used this product on some high end polish finish watches and have gotten them back to almost new condition. Wish this product was more accessible at local stores."
5,Great stuff!,Use this at home and in my shop. Works well on all metals but is gentler than Brasso or other metal cleaners. Easy to use - great results.
2,Too Harsh for Silver Plate,"I can only speak for the effectiveness of this product on silver plate, so this review relates to using the product on silver plate only.I have tried many products, always looking for something easier,faster. Well I thought I had found it with the simi, however after the first use, I realized it was taking far too much silver off. Plate is fragile and there is only so much of it before you hit the base metal, which means... no more silver.Do not use this product on your silver plate. I use Haggertys and am currently going to try the new silver spray, and a horse hair silver cleaning brush. Will write reviews on those after using them."
5,SimiChrome Polish,I have used this product for the past 5 years and it far surpasses any other product that I have tried. Just a very small amount will restore the finish on any silver item.
5,"""SEMICROME SHINE""",I have used semicrome polish since the seventies and is still a great polish and will out shine the rest.
5,Metal polish,I was in the Marine Corps when I first got my hands on some of this polish. I NEVER had a complaint at ANY inspection for my brass after I got it. OH! ... I never used 'Brasso' again once I saw the results I got with Simichrome.
1,Broad overview of too many makes and models,"This book cover many motorcycles. So many, in fact, that there is really nothing specific about any one particular motorcycle. The only specific information concerns engine changes between the model years. There are no specific wiring diagrams, engine power specifications or component descriptions (such as sprocket sizes for a particular model). If found the book difficult to use and relatively uniformative. A much more specific book about two or three models would be far more useful."
5,Great cinematography,"An eerie story shot in a war format....not just a ""horror"" story.This is precisely why I liked it, because the horror element isn't the only story line at first....the soldiers in war theme is.If you want a good well made movie that is realistic in the Vietnam sense (not talking war gore either) with the supernatural element included, then this is for you. Picture yourself in a conflict, ghosts are the farthest thing from your mind and so it was for the ROK soldiers...at first. Would recommend this for veterans as well. Once again....great cinematography and scenery."
3,Vietnam meets Supernatural!,"Taking Place during the Vietnam War, the film follows a shell- shocked officer as he heads a group of men through enemy territory on a mission to find a lost platoon. The men venture to R-Point, which is the location of a bandoned mansion that was the last place the men were supposedly last at before their disappearance. With hope of finding clues to the missing men, the group of soldiers crosses into supernatural realms when a certain few begins seeing ghosts of dead men, causing paranoia and fear inthe squad. Unlike other films in the sub-genre, this film focuses more on the creepy atmosphere and does'nt play with the paranoia theme as much as others may have. The movie stays at a constant slow, but moody, pace as it revolves soley around the group of men and their encounter with the supernatural. Overall a creepy old-school ghost story that delivers the chills thanks to its sucessful use of the secluded atmosphere around them. Worth checking out."
4,Platoon meets House on Haunted Hill,"I managed to catch this flick on the Sundance Channel the other night and was glad I did. R-Point is a very decent Korean supernatural thriller set in and during the Vietnam War. A small group of soldiers is sent to investigate the dissapearence of another squad last stationed at location R-Point. Upon arrival (to what is said is to be a temple but looks more like an old, decrepit mansion), no one is to be found and strange things begin to happen to the soldiers. The movie utilizes its scenery and surroundings to create a very eerie atmosphere throughout. I would not consider R-Point to be a horror just a generally creepy and interesting flick well worth watching."
2,Just another Deathwatch in the Keep's Bunker...,"Heard the one about the army unit that comes across a haunted Keep/bunker/trench/rest home and find themselves killing each other as their past sins find them out? Well, you're about to hear it again, Korean style. Set during the Vietnam War, this is more inspired by WW1 chiller Deathwatch than The Keep (particularly the ghostly radio messages from dead troops), and certainly a lot better than the dire The Bunker, but despite some good moments and the odd good image thrown up en route - especially a thunderstorm in a field filled with war graves - it adds up to little. An unexceptional timefiller."
4,knife,"Great knife, the one I received had knicks at the bottom of the base of the sharp edge...... was a little disappointed but everything else was good. Would recommend to others."
3,Diver wants quality,"I have always tried to have quality in my life. Quality people and quality products. I chose this knife because after reading specs, I felt it was quality. I have not gotten to use it yet on a dive but I can say it is overall quality and I am happy with my purchase."
5,Great Gift!,"I bought this knife for my father, a SCUBA diver whose been diving for around 15 years. He loves it and uses it all the time when he dives! It's a great length and he loves that the blade is titanium, which is strong and good for cutting nets that he finds underwater, as well any other fishing equipment or trash that doesn't belong in the ocean. Overall an excellent choice for the gift and for diving!"
3,good quality but some flaws,"The quality of the materials is good, Ive taken this on a few dives and everything is functional and feels sturdy. The two problems I have with this. One the knife is too big and secondly the tip is not sharp enough (if you are using for spearfishing)One good thing, the knife locks into place so you dont have to worry about losing it."
3,Diving Knife,"Item arrived on time as promised. The knife is worth the purchase price. It seems to have a good edge and fits in the sheath properly. That said, the straps are a little cheap. I will replace them with something a little more durable. I would still recommend this product to others that are just beginning to dive."
2,Too much variety and too different,"This remix CD by the Austrian group consists of genres like hip-hop, funk, jazz, drum-n-bass, and ambient, all mixed together. Some songs are fast, some slow. Chances are, you won't like most of the tracks. I only liked #3 personally."
1,"Great performances, shoddy transfer for download","This was my first and (so far) last music download purchase from amazon. One of the movements in the Debussy (as I recall; it was some time ago) had a fairly big gap of silence (or premature cutoff; can't remember) in it, which ruined it for me. Amazon did give a refund, but who wants that hassle? I do plan to get the CD one of these days, though; so I could recommend that."
4,complete turbine book,"This has got to be the most complete turbine book I have ever seen. Containing pretty much everything on cycle analysis, it even provides a good review of thermodynamics and compressible flow. It does, however, look to be a little difficult to teach from with eqautions and graphs flying about, but to the knowledged user it will serve as a great and complete reference. (There are some errors in the text you might want to correct found on the book's webpage.)"
2,Pic NOT ACCURATE,"The product that was shipped to me looks nothing like the one pictured. Do a search for ""Tweezerman Combo Nail Clipper"" to see the ACTUAL product they will send. It has a stupid contoured handle that makes it HARDER to hold the tool, not easier. The metal also grinds and scratches itself when flipping the handle, which seems like iffy craftsmanship. I will agree that the blades, new, are very sharp and line up well, but who wants an ultra sharp tool that is difficult to hold and use? :("
3,Small,"Purchased this to replace my toenail clippers that I lost. The clippers are really sharp and good quality, but a bit small for toenail clippers for guys. Also, the clipper blades are angled and straight. I find curved blades to be a lot easier to use."
1,They sent me a different item,I was disappointed to receive a different nail clipper than the one I ordered. What's the point of showing a specific description and picture if that's not what you're selling?
1,DON'T BUY IT!!!! DON'T BUY IT!!!! DON'T BUY IT!!!!,"if you lift this high chair, the legs fall off. if you take the tray off, its almost impossible to put back on. (for an adult, forget about for a child!) and the ""adjustable height"" feature just means the seat falls off. this is SO NOT functional, it only stays in place if no one touches or even looks at it. very dissapointing!! not only ugly, but flimsy!! buy something else!!"
2,Don't waste your money,"My 2 year old has the stroller carseat set and she loves it! So I thought I would get her the matching high chair for her baby. First, the directions weren't very clear. My daughter patiently waited until I was done then we set it up in her room. As soon as you pick it up to move it, the bottom half comes apart. The legs aren't secured at all. The tray won't stay on either. It's frustrating for me so it must be extremely annoying to a 2 year old. I am very disappointed."
1,Useless - can't play with it - parts missing,My daughter got this for Christmas from Santa and can't even play with it. One part was missing. I called customer service on 12/25 and their voice mail was full so I couldn't leave a message. I called customer service on 12/26 and left a detailed message per their instructions. I called back today 1/9 to follow up and was told they are working their way through the calls. I should have it in 4 to 5 weeks. I would recommend buying from Tollytots. This is the worst customer service I have seen.
1,assembly required??????,"We thought this would be the big hit christmas morning, wrong. Had a hard time assembling product. Would be nice if required screws were provided. While our daughter typically loves doll play this one was in the closet within the day. Win some lose some."
1,Too hard to use,"I got this high chair for my 3-year old daughter. She loved it for 5 minutes, but because the tray was just impossible for her to put on and take off, she gave up playing with it - far too frustrating for her. Also, the ""3-in-1"" features are impossible for her fingers to manage - even I have trouble pushing the chair into a new position. This is now a toy that is in the closet and was a waste of money for us."
1,Tray,"We bought our daugther this high chair because she loved to put her baby dolls in a real high chair. After, we purhcased this,it was no useful. The tray would not stay on. It kept falling off. She used without tray which its okay for a short time then when she realized that the tray was missing... she got rid of it and asked for a better one. Sent this garbage thing to the grabage.. not worth to play with so dont disapoint on little girl or girls on this item there fore dont BUY."
2,Not worth the money,"My 3 year old daughter is baby crazy. All she wanted for her birthday was a high chair. Believe me when I say I did a ton of research on which one was good, bad and so forth. I bought this high chair with the belief that it was the best one out there for the money and it would be worth the purchase. This is NOT a sturdy toy. The tray falls off if you barely touch it and will not stay on. We eventually just put up the tray. The tray for kids seems to be most of the fun so my daughter is definitely not impressed with it. Forget about changing seat positions. Not to mention that it seems as though they barely used enough material to make the legs on it. This high chair is cheaply made which surprised me being the brand name. We are highly disappointed in this product. We will continue to look for other high chairs of better quality to purchase in the future."
5,Excellent tutorial!,Very user friendly! Gives small pieces of information and lessons that are easily followed by the beginner. You can easily be fingerpicking within 30 minutes.
5,Extremely pleased.,"If you've bought book after book hoping to get to that ""next level"", without satisfaction, then this is the book you've been looking for. For those of you who've played chords and always wanted to fingerpick but have had your eyes glaze over by lines of sheet music. I had played only chords for 8 years and within 5 minutes of starting this book/CD I was fingerpicking! Furthermore, it was easy! The ""lightbulb"" in my brain was turned on and my understanding of picking in general was illuminated. This may be the best money you'll ever pay to learn Travis picking."
3,Good instruction - Lame tunes,"Many have already described how good the instruction in this book is. And rightfully so. So I will bring up the one negative which made me regret getting this book.Apart from 2 or 3 songs such as John Barley, Sloop John B, etc., the songs used for demo are mostly lame ballads and fail to generate much excitement about playing them in me. The best tune is probably the opener, written by Mark Hanson himself. Also, most of these are sing-along types in which the vocal does most of the work instead of letting the guitar stay front and center. It would have been much better to feature mostly instrumentals where the lessons learned can be displayed in full glory."
4,Travis Picking,"This book came recommended by a friend who has been playing guitar for over 30 years. I have had this book only for a short time so far, but have gotten through the first few lessons. The lessons (at least the beginning lessons) are made very easy to understand and complete. So far, its been great. If it had a dvd with video lessons, it would be over the top."
2,Waste of good money.,"This book was a waste of time and money. Nowhere does it get into HOW to do the fingerpicking, how to get good at it. The songs are not helpful, they have been adulterated by the author and no song is complete anyway. The book is thin, contains barely any real information. I would have done better with an ""idiot's Guide,"" seriously, and I am no idiot, just a novice guitarist. If you mae it clear to me and give me enough information I can learn anything. I have a PhD so I am assuming it is not my lack of reading ability that makes this a poor instruction manual. I have several other books and all are FAR superior to this one. Don't waste your money."
5,The definitive place to start learning Travis style,"I found this book very well thought out and paced. Hanson starts out explaining each pattern in simple, clear terms. The accompanying CD which has audio instructions and played examples is terrific and complements the excercises very well. I also loved the layout of the book, it's clear and well spaced out.If you've put off learning Travis/alternating bass style because you could not find the right instructional material or motivation now you don't have any excuses because this book should let you jump right in :)"
5,A must for people learning to fingerpick,"Usually instructional books are a complete waste of time for me. However, I found that this book is extremely well organized and thought out. You learn basic patterns and how to switch between each of the different possible chord formations. As the book advances, so do the picking patterns. For each chapter, there is a song to learn, so you can apply your newly acquired skills (some songs are dorky, but oh well)."
3,Fun times,"I've enjoyed this text, but the cd does not have stops for each step, so you must keep your control handy.."
2,Not bad,"Could use more chord tablature. The CD is not good quality. I tried to contact the publisher for a replacement and was told (by Mark Hanson himself in fact) that since I bought it from Amazon I'd have to take it up with them and 'Good Luck, nyuk nyuk'.Pretty shoddy. I won't be buying any further products from them. Buy a used copy if you must."
4,Likable silliness for young kids,"I recently bought this book for my 6 year old daughter, who is a pretty good reader. The stories are short and she can easily read them quickly, but she enjoys them and I think she'll end up reading them to her younger cousins. I think both of us like the silliness and unpredictability of the stories. Also, we like to give ""voice"" to inanimate objects, which is really what each story does. The watercolor illustrations are vivid and really capture the imagination of the story itself!"
5,Well Come To The Galaxy,Bralalalala is awesome! He is a free thinker who breaks through conventional norms into cosmic truths that surpass tradition and mediocrity. It is definitely worth the [money] to check it out. Enjoy!
1,Deceptive photo,"I thought I was purchasing 4 spring form pans. I only got 1.The pan works great, however, beware... You are only purchasing a single 4-1/2"" spring form pan.AMAZON... change the picture or put a more detailed description, this is a failure of communication on your part."
1,Misleading,"Buyer Beware!Contrary to the photo, you are purchasing only ONE of these tiny pans, not a set of four! This was a lesson to me to always read all of the page before purchasing. Live and learn..."
1,Deceptive Advertising,"Yes, I too was fooled by the photo. One pan is sent. As other reviews have stated...the pan itself is likely a wonderful pan to use....but reading the entire ad would be a good idea."
3,mini springform pan,Dummy me! I looked at the picture and thought I was getting what I saw...what a concept! Only recieved one mini pan when the picture showed four. Read the fine print.
4,They work,"These things are inexpensive and they work for what they were made for. I had to modify mine to fit a larger speaker. If your hoping to fit a 6 1/2"" speaker in here, you might need to do some cutting. It's not terribly hard as the plastic cuts fairly easily (not to say that the material is cheap). I used a hack saw blade as I needed to cut in a circle and having it on the hack saw doesn't work. If you need more room in your doors to allow a window to roll down or just to bring the woofer out a bit more, these will do the trick."
5,"SCOSCHE 6 1/2"" TAPERED SPEAKER SPACER",The speaker spacer is slightly tapered and looks very good with my new speakers. The spacer is has a machined look from the side and works well.
3,Send me a lullaby,"As the reviewer below said, this album is just a re-issue of 1987's ""Live at the Bottom Line"". The sound quality isn't a big improvement over the original release, and despite the buying info, there are no bonus tracks. However, live performances always have been an important part of DC's oeuvre. For the most part, the songs here are taken from the album ""The guitar and other machines"", but it's hard to reproduce the complicated and powerful sound of this album on stage. Except for some extended versions of DC classics like ""Jacqueline"" and ""Missing boy"", there's actually no reason for buying ""Night in N.Y."". The studio album ""The guitar and.."" also features four live tracks with a better sound quality, recorded at WOMAD. By the way, DC's rarities collections ""Dry"" and ""Red shoes"" were recently reissued in Europe."
4,Durutti comes alive!,"This was an early 90's release, when Factory Records was still alive. It is a must for any Durutti Column fan that didn't catch the Column in concert. The live version of ""Requiem"" is outstanding. However, the sound quality of this recording leaves a lot to be desired."
3,Alright game,"Got this game because I loved the show, but it definitely lacked a lot. I feel that the creators of the game didn't put a lot of effort into making this game. No offense to anyone who created the game, but it feels like it was rushed out the door before it was tested properly. The game lags a lot. It lag all of the time. It's the first wii game to ever lag. I actually think the DS game was before than this one. Now that's a shame."
1,Fishy reviews,I noticed all of these 5 star rave reviewers have ONLY reviewed this author's books. It seems as if he got his friends to do these reviews...be skeptical.
2,Handfull of them,"well after receiving this cd free from the record company as part of a promotional offer, I wasn't going to be complaining the track listing. It didn't have too many awesome songs: Unspeakable Joy [who can say no to that] Joy [nice lil beat especially in the first 3 minutes] and a few other songs are listenable. Some are just, bad! Better luck in the future Manny Lehman, but I'd say just pass on this cd."
4,Its simply astonishing,There is a slight learning curve as it is different from a normal frizbee but once you learn its pretty awesome.
4,Olive N Figs Polka Dots Handbag,"What a great bag! Comfortable, roomy, lightweight, and so very colorful! I have received so many compliments on this funky little bag! Everything fits in this bag and the added extra compartments are great for your cell phone, gum, lip gloss, or all the little ""stuff"" floating around in the bottom of your bags! Thanks for a great, fun, functional bag for a busy lifestyle!"
3,"Cute purse, bigger than expected",The purse is darling but i ordered it for a 10 year old girl and i think it was too big. The picture makes it look smaller than it actually is. Otherwise its very cute.
3,Very useful,I purchased an unlocked MPx220 from Europe to use with T-mobile and I needed a cover for it. The cover with 3 piece starter kit is a good fit. The cover might be a bit tight initially but over a period it will loosen up. Sometimes the the plastic might block the power changer but I just cut off a bit of the plastic. Unfortuntely I havent tested the car charger and the handsfree kit as the MPx220 has these in the original package.
3,Fast Delivery,"Fast Delivery, too bad it doesn't fit exactly with my cellphone and it's not the exact brand"
3,Good product for the price,"I got this pair and give my 12-year-old pair of similar Chicago knives to a young coworker. But after I got these knives, I asked him for the old pair and gave him the new ones.What was wrong? They are not too bad, especially considering the price. But when I looked at the back of one knife, it is not perfectly straight. It can be corrected by some forceful bending because it is a small knife after all. Obviously I didn't do any metallurgical analysis, but the stainless steel just feel different from the older version. It is sharp enough to slice paper out of the box, though.If I didn't have the older version to compare them with, I'd give it 4 stars for sure. Now I guess I'll stay with the ""vintage"" version. My young friend, however, is very happy to get two brand new knives as a gift."
3,crpalm129,The quality of the item was good. It's only downside is keeping it sharp enough to do the job. It looses it's edge rather easily.
4,Great cheap knives,"I have a few of the Chicago Cutlery knives: this utility knife, a boning knife, a bread knife, and a slicing knife. They're great for what they are--cheap, comfortable, and very sharp. And the soft blade is extremely easy to steel and sharpen.They are not high end knives. For cutting that requires technique, or high volume (like what you'd use a chefs knife for, or a paring knife) look elsewhere. The CC versions of these knives were not designed for serious cooks. Balance is wrong, stamped blades are difficult to grab. Also the steel is so soft it won't hold an edge for more than a minute of hard use. Look to the higher end german, french, or japanese knives for the real workhorses.But for your other knives, these can't be beat these for price. And I love the feel of the wood handles."
5,try it!,"Never mind the overstudied theorists who can reduce anything live to dust! Listen with your spirit, and let your soul drink the vastness - you'll wonder if you've died and went to heaven!"
1,Obsolete!,"I'm sorry, my friends, but this is NOT Bach! Funereal tempos, thick textures, a million players to a part - this set should be of interest to no one except historians of outdated performance practice. Get the Gardiner version for music."
4,Pure rock and roll,"Instead of sounding like two old timers living in the past these men lay down sounds like two thoroughbreds in their first big race. Fresh, quality great song after great song. Well written and extremely well played. Interesting how they use a left to right and right to left stereo effect in most of the songs. More than any other album I've ever heard. Not a complaint just an interesting decision on their part.Get this one."
2,Delius Orchestral Works,"Lackluster performance. Poorly engineered, need to constantly adjust volume to listen to music."
3,It is ok,I didn't like the way it was written.....they tried to make it sound like an Indian was talking. It was disjointed and the story line weak.
2,"Ugly story, ugly characters","I like a story that has characters one can admire. This story is mostly swearing, drinking, smoking, and murder. The only redeeming virtues are a well told story (if you can get through the odd dialogue) and justice (poetic, not legal) at the end. This is no Louis L'Amour or Tony Hillerman story. I will not be reading any more Peter Bowen books."
5,Baby Loves This One,"My three month-old baby absolutely loves this album, especially the first track, ""La La La."" She always stops crying when she hears the first few seconds of it. It'll put a smile on your face, too. It makes me nostalgic for the days of youth..."
3,not as bad as people are saying....,"While it wasn't a great event, it was still an event worth watching. Don't listen to all the reviews that just talk about the main event, there were still some good moments (Roy Nelson vs Fabricio Werdum, Dustin Poirier's mounted triangle submission, Stephen Thompson's head kick knockout, Josh Koscheck and Mike Pierce in a close battle). It's an event worth watching."
1,"Carlos ""The Natural Born Runner"" Condit = Point Fighter","Nick Diaz got totally screwed with this fight. Carla Condit kept running away from Nick like a little bitch. He was terrified of Nick Diaz, it was so obvious. Condit's plan was to point fight and run. Condit threw some lame a$$ kicks and won the fight. Nick Diaz pushed the fight from beginning to end, but Carla Condit kept running away. If you know anything about MMA, Nick Diaz is the man to watch. He brings it every time!! He goes toe to toe every fight!! Don't waste your money on this UFC. Condit's a joke!! He should be banned from MMA, he's a disgrace to the MMA world."
2,"Carlos ""The runnin man"" Condit","Typical Greg Jackson special. Supposedly we were told this would be a ""war"",but instead we got a remake of Forrest Gump running. The lead actor was Carlos Condit. What happened to the Natural born killer? Maybe that's why he so easily agreed to a rematch? On top of that what was the Judges watching? What a letdown!"
1,One of the most anticipated matches of the year ends up a stinker,"Both of these guys are known for ""bringing it"", however Jackson coached condit avoided engaging the entire fight, choosing merely to survive.And Diaz was unable to get his game going or change it to compensate for Condits abysmal showing.Sadly Condit kinda won 3 rounds to 2, and I was rooting for Nick.You may or may not dispute that decision, but you can't dispute that the fight itself was 5 rounds of suck.A fight you will never want to watch again.A fight that made Diaz never want to fight again.I have no recollection of any of the other fights on the card.Don't buy this dvd.And don't buy the one where Overoid fights Lesnar either, you know why."
1,Horrible Judges Decision,"The Judges Decision in the main event is one of the Worst I've ever seen. It's tough to give a Nick Diaz Event 1 star but the decision is worth it. They gave the win to a guy who ran away and landed leg kicks for 5 rds. I honestly can't even give a legit analysis of the other fights on the card because this decision was so bad I tried to forget I even wasted money buying it.This sport is slowly starting to die (look at the UFC's ratings & PPV #'s) with the new way it's dictated by rankings, the way it's judged & reported, and the overall direction of the sport. It's a shame. Used to be a great sport to watch. Maybe a new promoter with a new vision will come along and pump some juice into it.The UFC was credited with saving sport but honestly the sport was NEVER gonna be main stream. The UFC & it's Zuffa parent company is now starting to kill the sport of MMA."
1,"Carlos ""The Natural Born Ballerina"" Condit...","I watched Carlos Condit crawl along the edge of a straight razor. That's my dream. It's my nightmare. Crawling, slithering, RUNNING along the edge of a straight razor ... and surviving.We must kill them. We must incinerate them. Watered-down PPV after Watered-down PPV. Point fighter after Point fighter. Incompetent judge after Incompetent judge. Chael Sonnen after Chael Sonnen.And they call me a Troll. What do you call it when the Trolls accuse the Troll?They lie. They lie, and we have to be merciful, for those who lie. Those Zuffa shills. I hate them. I do hate them.The horror....the horror."
1,Is a Goblet a Plate???,"I ordered two sets of the above dessert plates, and after waiting for three months I received not dessert plates, but dessert goblets. Having returned them I have still only received credit for the return of one set. I cannot recommend in the least that anyone attempt to order these from Amazon."
5,Loved it!,This book is amazing! It taught me things I never knew existed inside the body! I highly recommend this book!
1,Kind of Bizarre,"I first heard of her in 1996 and read the book. I then ordered items from her online store which were toothpaste, soap, deodorant (aluminum free) and used Borax Mule Team on my hair which she suggested was the only thing to use to wash hair to keep from getting toxins. None of it worked. Not only was I stinking, but I had plaque caked on my teeth, my hair was super tangled, mangled and caked w/dandruff. I didn't get better until I started using other products.If anyone would like to comment on this post and direct me to her credentials as an M.D. Otherwise, I think her claims about flukes are far out. She does not have enough scientific evidence documented of this. Then I heard she died of cancer herself; how could this be w/all the books she's written about curing cancer???"
2,Study in parasites,"Hulda Regehr Clark attributes the presence of parasites as the cause of most diseases. Research indicates that her zapper really doesn't work. This is an interesting theory, however."
1,I had to read it with my own eyes.,I don't know what alarms me more: the fact that someone would so irresponsibly write and publish such tripe....or the fact that so many people buy into it.To so recklessly pass off pure fiction as truth should be criminal.
1,The biggest hoax ever. It makes you puke :(,"I know so much about electricity and I know a lot about Human Health. This book is the worst ever. It is the biggest LIE on Earth. I never ever read anything this stupid. Don't even think to buy it. I've read some so-so books, but this is totally out of control. If somebody pays for this book, it will be total waste of time and money. Don't go into the trap.Authors like this laugh all the way to the bank...Respectfully, Tatiana"
2,the cure for all diseases,"after scanned through the book, i am not very happy with the way the book look. it is very hard to use when you open the book to read the informations.you have to really open up and hold on to it, i guest the book is had too many informations so it is too thick."
1,Book of Paranoia,"This is the worse health book I have ever read. All health issues are on parasites, chemicals, and molds and how they invade your body. Reading this book is like entering the Twilight Zone."
3,Good book on living healthy,The zapper is a nonsense based on child's toy and the instructions for building it have errors.Many of the health style advises are good.
2,"Is Writing Through-out the Book ""Acceptable""","The book was very much disshevelled and torn at many edges. Is writing throughout the book considered ""acceptable"" - I didn't think so. There was no mention in the sellers write-up that they had hand-written throughout the entire book. Very disappointed with the quality of the book."
1,Don't waste your money,"I honestly didn't expect to GET ""the cure for all diseases"", I hoped for some nuggets of useful information though. Unless for pure entertainment purposes, don't waste your money."
1,Quack who couldn't cure herself,"""Dr."" Clark defrauded hundreds of people of millions of dollars with her quackery. More importantly, she dissuaded many people from getting actual medical treatment for treatable diseases by claiming to be able to cure them with her quackery.There is no scientific basis for ANY of the theories in ""Dr."" Clark's book. However, that doesn't matter to any of the ""alternative health"" community that spends their time lauding her book.Ironically, Clark died of multiple myeloma in September 2009. Her website and publicists lied about the cause of death, stating it was complications from a spinal cord injury, until her death certificate was filed and the actual cause of death was revealed. (Indeed, her commercial site, [...], still falsely claims she died of complications from a spinal cord injury.) Her personal website now admits she died of multiple myeloma, but says she was unable to cure herself because she discovered the disease too late."
4,This book will dramatically alter your perception of illness,"I was confused and skeptical about the links of all diseases to parasites, but was really amazed with the results of using the parablast. I ground my teeth at night (a symptom of parasitic infection) for over 25 years without ever knowing the cause. After using the zapper, I immediately stopped grinding.The only down side of the book was that many of my questions about the device were not addressed. I also think the author's plan for a clean, non-toxic and parasite-free lifestyle are extraordinarily unrealistic in the western world. However, I am changed and ever-grateful for the knowledge I gained, and I hope to see this valuable information infiltrate western medicine in the near future."
3,Handbook for paranoia (take this book in small doses),"Although Dr. Clark's premise that the two most dangerous threats to our health, pollution and parasites, might prove to be scientifically true, she completely ignores the most powerful healing (and harming) mechanisms we have - the mind and heart. She details some quick methods of ""zapping"" parasites and detoxing the body, but also proposes dramatic lifestyle changes that anyone would be hardpressed to follow for any length of time, unless you're willing to live in a virtual ""bubble."" In Dr. Clark's worldview, pretty much everything is potentially a threat, and you must take great care to limit your exposure (including getting rid of your indoor pets and pretty much the entire current contents of your home, especially your bathroom and kitchen). In my worldview, walking around afraid of being exposed to any chemicals and parasites puts me in a constant state of fear and distress, and that's a sure recipe for stress-related disease."
4,An interesting perspective,This book was recommended to me by a friend who has been battling cancer and swears by its findings and procedures. I am not recommending this based on anything except interesting reading. The order process was smooth and the book arrived in the time expected.
4,hmm,"I was a little disappointed in the book, it presents a lot of material, however you can get some of the same recipees free through the net , just have to look harder."
1,"Spare yourself nightmares, dont read this book.","I read this book and cannot get these images out of my head. Hulda is fanatical at the very least. Everything is caused by parasites or toxins, picked up from food, pets, friends, dirt, air, teeth, you name it. Her ""cures"" are positively medieval. After reading my skin literally crawled. Its been years now and I cannot get this awful book out of my head. It's haunting like an Edgar Allen Poe story. Dont read or you will never feel normal again."
5,The Cure for All Diseases by Hulda Clark,"I was very pleased with how quickly my order arrived & the packaging was great. I ordered two books and both were new and in great condition. My experience with this transaction was a pleasant one. As a matter of fact, I just ordered two more of these books for a couple of my friends.Thank you."
3,Interesting Theories,Does this work? Who knows. I wouldn't drop conventional treatment and totally rely on these recommendations.
4,RAY V.....Maine,This is a great book. This author has the intestinal fortitude to put into writingwhat many healers have known for a long time. This is an excellent way tostart on your journey to health.
4,great understanding of human health,I have read dozens of books on how to stay healthy and fit. In my opinion Hulda Clark's understanding of what went wrong and how to correct it are right on the mark.To put everything into practice can be cumbersome and will require lifestyle changes. I've done some things. The results are worth it.
5,Great Remedies,"Excellant Kidney Cleanse program if you get Kidney stones, this will put an end to them.Good luck."
5,A great resource,"Knowing people that have been helped by similar techniques, I'm now able to understand how it all works."
5,QUACKERY?,"THIS BOOK IS BASED ON FIFTY-YEAR-OLD REPEATABLE SCIENCE THAT YOU CAN DO AT HOME - PRETTY THREATENING STUFF TO THE POWERS THAT BE. BILLIONS OF DOLLARS CAN SUPPRESS TRUTH WITH LIES. THIS, IF NOTHING ELSE, HAS BEEN WELL PROVEN. QUACKERY COMES IN MANY GUISES. MEDICINE IN AMERICA IS A CASH ENGINE THAT RUNS ON OBFUSCATION. BUYER BEWARE INDEED."
5,Please Build The Electronic Zapper!,"This is one of the best projects, the most useful and unbelievable device a human can possess. No wonder Tom Brokaw or those gentlemen won't mention this stuff on TV! It would almost close down the present medical system. Use it for your loved ones and see for yourself."
4,great information,"Dr. Clark's philosophy is brought to light in the book. It's a good, holistic book with basic remedies for everything. These are remedies for folks who experience little to no success with western medicine treatment and underwhelming results from other naturopathic approaches. Electric zapping combined with removing toxins in your environment and food, various organ cleanses, and matter of fact approach to food molds and solvents. The liver cleanse(s) did me wonders! I have done the parasite cleanse, and continue maintenance, due to a suppressed immune system from CFS."
1,Canonical quackery,Why on earth is anybody still reading this tripe? This is the 21st Century. The jury is in: Clark's claims are and always were abject nonsense. Even the Mexicans rumbled her.[...]
1,The Cure for All Diseases,"Don't waste your money. No human can possibly have any kind of a life and live like this woman wants you to...perhaps if you live in a plastic bubble...no wait, I'm sure she wouldn't want you exposed to plastic...make that a glass bubble. Maybe her ideas work..I don't know because I have to work and to live like this would take all day. If your life is totally unbearable you could try this I guess."
1,Lauren CT,"I could not wait to read this book. I am sorry I have. I feel like crawling in a cave. I am afraid now to pet my dog, cat, ferrets and birds breathe our air and if I do everything the good doctor suggests regarding cleaning out the house...I would have to throw everything I own out and burn the house down and start over so that I would be germ and chemical free. I am, for my sanity, going to forget about this book once I donate it to my local library. Also, I cannot build this zapper maching if I tried. There are directions yes, but no Kapiche!"
4,This is REALLY Funny,"This book is comprised of short stories of the authors life. It is mostly of gay and lesbian lifestyles, but really appeals to everyone as it portrays situations ANYONE could be in. I especially liked the ""Airport Terminal"" story. As someone who has been on the Atkins diet before, this story really related to me. I also suggest it for any gay or lesbian teen who may be having difficulty with their sexuality as all the stories are positive about being out and coming out. I throughly enjoyed it. I bought it directly from the Author who was at a signing in my home town. The only reason it is not five stras is because it is a self published book and the cover and some of ther errors in text are noticable. All over good stories though. I enjoyed reading it."
5,An excellent guide to the master of cinema,"If you want a good read about cinema's most amazing director, then this is the book for you. It contains lots of really great insight not just on shooting the movie, but how it even started. Though author Douglas Brode tends to get a little too political, it is a really good book that I keep coming back to. Read at all costs."
4,daily through to easter,"Just as early pilgrims needed the light of the moon for Easter, and thus we got a movable Easter day in accordance with a full moon, so we light in our journey. The daily lesson lift up our spirit and draw us deaper into the mystery of the Cross. The selection of Luke is useful - providing a journey with Jesus with substance and narrative."
4,"GREAT BAG, CONVIENT AND EASY TO CARRY AROUND....",MY PRINTER AND THE OUTLET CORD FOR THE PRINTER FITS PERFECT. I WISH IT HAD SOME MORE ROOM TO CARRY PAPER OR INK ALSO. BUT I'M SATISFIED WITH MY PURCHASE AND WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE. ALSO THE COLOR MAKES IT EASY TO FIND WHEN TRAVELING WITH ALOT OF LUGGAGE. I HAVE THE HP A600 OR A6300 (I FORGOT)
5,Terrific,"For someone reading their first book about Alexander the Great, I found this work easy to digest and comprehensive. Green's fluid writing style makes this a ""quick read"", while covering enough detail to make you appreciate the accomplishments of AG. This is much more than a detailed history of AG's military accomplishments, and helps to understand AG as a person, both good and bad."
4,Excellent !,I am no history professor but I have always had an interest on this subject. Alexanders exploits are quoted in so many other capaigns after his death I thought it would be great to learn about him as well. The book is hard to put down and spends quite a bit of time on Phillip his father another interesting figure. I encourage anyone to read this who is inclined towards military conqusets /historical figures etc.
5,One of the most honest biographies of Alexander III to date!,"Peter Green's phenomenal account of possibly the most controversial military leader in history, delivers exactly what its title suggests; a historical biography. He proves himself as one of the foremost experts regarding Alexander of Macedon, the most complex historical figure to rise from Western Civization. Green captures both the historical importance and the consequences of Alexander's achievements, while paying close attention to any information revealing his emotional and psychological nature."
2,A Strange book.,"I have read many previous books about Alexander the Great, none as strange as Peter Green's ""Alexander of Macedon"". Using a small amount of resources, Green attempted to recreate Alexander's journey from Macedon to his untimely death in Persia. Much of the book is fairly accurate, but some of it seems like wild speculation. If you enjoy books that are mostly fiction, than ""Alexander of Macedon"" is definitely your cup of tea."
3,Cultural references really not needed,"A very detailed accounting of Alex the Greats exploitsbased upon numerous historical authors.The book could very much benefit from additionalmaps included in the appropriate sections.The chapters dealing with Alex's early campaigns in Persiamention MANY persion cities, and there is NO mapin these chapters showing their locations!There is a rudamentary map a few chapters back,but a more detailed map is really needed.Also, its arrogant of the author to usenumerous references to people and events in British cultureto describe Alex's exploits (never mind theunending use of cliche'd french, latin, greek, and germanphrases-is he just showing offhis language skills??)Believe or not Mr. Green, the whole world does not residein Great Britain,and chic cultural references willbecome incomprehensible through time."
3,Peter Green on Alexander,"This book is well researched, and definately deserves attention, but I feel the author is way too biased, and overly critical of Alexander.It's well known that Alexander the Great conquered the world in his day, and at times he did things that weren't so great out of political and strategic necessities. However, Green tries to paint Alexander to be an absolute monster, which is most definately not the case. His bias really gets in the way of the reading, and gets old after about the first 20 pages. You can tell from page one, that this writer has an agenda. He makes preposterous claims like 'Alexander particularly hated ugly people' and says Hephaestion was stupid, and several other things that have no base, and really make me wonder about the credibility of the author. Other than that though, it is well researched, and will give people, hopefully another version of Alexander, from someone who absolutely hates his subject matter."
5,Peter Green & Alexander,"Green presents the story of Alexander as a comprehensive process, giving equal weight to Alexander's personal life, as much as the culture in which shaped the conquerer. Other bios tend to focus on the intimate life of Alexander, but Green provides much more substantial material for anyone looking for a true perspective on the life of Alexander."
4,Very Good but my goodness what a map mess!,"Alexander of Macedon is excellent. Mr. Green gives us a many faceted Alexander, not the two dimensional man of popular histories and movies.While not entirely a military history all the battles are given a full telling and here is where the book falls a bit, not in the writing but in the maps. This is a common failing found in many books of the type and I find it most prevalent in books published by universities. Mr. Green's book is an entertaining and worthwhile read however to make sense of the fighting, getting the proper military style maps of the battles would be a good pre-reading plan."
5,A Fantastic Read!,"I have read Peter Green's other works and translations as well but his retelling of Alexander the Greats life fantastic. It is a very lucid read and will quickly captivate you. He presents a fairly partial view of Alexander and makes a few obvious points that Alexanders success was very much due to Phillip II's army and leaves it up to the reader to decide whether he participated in the planning of Phillip II's death, yet takes pains to point out that Olympia was probably the culprit. Despite the momentum provided by Phillip II's army that Alexander so nearly brings to disaster, Peter Green never the less makes a compelling effort to decipher Alexanders plausible motives for his actions based on works of Arrian Plutarch amongst others. I have read this book several times and recommend it to anyone desiring to read about Alexander's life before resorting to original sources."
4,These Episodes are from the First Season!,This video has two episodes from the first season of The Mary Tyler Moore Show and they are both very good. My favorite is the episode titled Bess You Is My Daughter Now which has Mary babysitting for Phyllis' daughter Bess who at first is not very happy about having to stay with Mary and the other episode is Divorce Isn't Everything in which Mary and Rhoda pretend to be two single divorced women and join a divorce support group just so that they can qualify for a discount for vacation to Paris that is being offered through the group and this is a good episode too. This is a good tape but the Mary Tyler Moore Show first season is on DVD and I have it and like it very much!
5,Sinister. Mysterious. Classic. Dark and Tiumphant.,"A good read. Not about Wall Street per say (a surprise given this author), but as good as any other Lefevre book. Four different stories, each self-contained, but overlapping very slightly. On p93 Lefevre mentions the previous collapse of Barings Brothers (yes, they collapsed once before about 100 years before Nick Leeson was born). Similar in mysterious nature to ""The Golden Flood,"" also by Lefevre."
5,"Very adorable, cuddley and sweet",I purchased this for my grandaughter and she loves it!! It is so adorable!!!! I might get one for myself. Well worth the $$. My grandaughter takes it with her everywhere. I am glad I purchased this item.
2,Ho hum,"I bought this novel after finding it on the review list of another Amazon reviewer. I guess I should have read all the reviews. It started out interesting enough, but I had trouble maintaining an interest. Part of the problem is the writing style, e.g., repetitively using characters' full names and using dialog that does not sound real. Part of the problem is dealing with small town social interactions, which can grow dull. Some reviewers seemed to like the novel, but all novels do not appeal to all people. I would personally recommend a pass."
3,"Nice coat, but Sizing is WAY off.","I ordered one of these as a Christmas present for my girlfriend, as she needed a nice winter coat to wear over business suits. The coat is very high quality, and Pendleton is a good brand. The issue was with the sizing. She wears a 12/14, so I ordered a 14, figuring the extra size would come in handy over a bulky suit. We received the coat, and it was tiny...probably a 6 or 8. The tags all read 14, so not sure if it was tagged wrong, or they just run small. We returned it, and then went to a department store here in town a week later and bought her a 14, which was a little big on her.So nice coat, and Amazon is great on returns, but beware on the sizing. Order these at least a size bigger than usual."
5,"Great ""how-to"" book","For anyone interested in learning to paint portraits, this is an excellent ""how-to"" book, much better than the average. For a relatively small book, it contains a surprising amount of information, including painting in different media and styles, selected palettes of several contemporary painters, with particular attention given to composition as well. I saw this book in Ireland on a recent trip, and am so glad to find that I can get my own copy here at home."
4,Surprised...,These puzzles were a hit with my 2 year old son for the simple fact it's the Power Rangers. I am only giving it 4 stars because I was surprised that the packaging is in a foreign language (Japanese??). If I was giving this as a gift to anyone but my son I probably would have returned it. The description should advise of the language. Of course there's not many instructions needed for a puzzle but other toys may be impossible to assembly or know the rules if it's not in English.
2,Way too Big-Not accurate sizing,"Loved this outfit but size is not accurate. This is much too big for a size 16/18. I believe it would probably fit 20/22 size range. I wear a 16 and it almost fell off of me. Too bad, was cute."
2,Different Mum group,"If you don't know by now, this is NOT the same group as the ones from Iceland. This Vienna based group plays trippy funk/dance music that isn't very good. It has it's moments, but not really worth the purchase; for me anyway. Also, the fact that I got caught thinking this was the Icelandic group really rattled me too. I see that the advertising for this disc was recently altered so the two groups are now seperated. A lot of good that did for me when I bought it though. Now you know."
3,Mum - Mum,"Competent and, at times, quite good downtempo from the German duo Mum. On their self-titled debut, they get the grooves going and don't fret much about the little stuff. ""Zero Gravity"" starts things funky and ""Caught Like a Trout"" keeps the Hammond organ kicking. ""Body Surrender"" falls headlong into future jazz territory; ""Kronos"" delves into drum 'n' bass; ""Miss Defied"" is a light, frothy spoken-word jazz confection. But, unfortunately, a good portion of the album is also unremarkable and passes by without so much as a dent. That's not to say that it's not good; it's just not memorable. Good for the background, but not for intense listening."
2,Liszt: 10 Hungarian Rhapsodies,The Liszt CD seems to skip at the beginning on our player. Perhaps it's faulted or an old copy. What should we do?
3,Pity the poor piano!,"Cziffra plays these pieces as if they had to bring in a new piano between each one. Percussive? My God, he's playing with a sledgehammer.Cziffra makes a joke of these pieces. This becomes evident when listening to others play them, particularly Szidon and Hofmann.I know that Cziffra can be restrained; he plays Liszt's piano concertos beautifully. Why he chose to takes these so lightly I'm not sure."
3,"If you like piano, this is for you.","I like the idea of getting a complete set from 1 to 20. The performer does a good job, but, after all, it is a one person performance, not an orchestra."
4,Indiana wants me,"The subject is very interesting if you are a trivia and history person. I am. The problems caused by time lines, shifting the clocks forward or back are many and well documented. In fact, it is the number of case histories that made me give it a 4 instead of a 5. After a while, my mind could't focus. I went to school in Indiana in the 60's (hence the title) and I remember the confusing and unique problems you could face to have a date for a movie. You could leave from one standard time zone, pick up your date in a different standard time zone, to go to a movie in a third time, a town on day light savings time.The studies presented on the economic effects of saving time were very interesting as some are proposing changes in the dates again.Overall, I recommend it as a nice summer read!"
5,Great book! Well written - A must read for all LDS members,"If you're LDS this is a must read. It's very well written and enjoyably so. Non-LDS might find it ensightful too, and give them more information about the true gospel. Simply a great and inspiring work. Keep up the good work Mr. Ridges."
5,A Surprise For Your Eyes,"I loved this program. It showed many animals I had never seen before on any of the other ""nature"" type programs I have. The program talkes about the special evolution that took place on Australia that resulted in some of the strangest animals on the planet.The program would be perfect for any household or classroom where they want an overview of most of these most unusual animals. Some of the segments are short, but not overly so. I was pleasantly surprised. Don't miss this one. I loved it and so will you"
1,Kindle is a Swindle: Thanks to DRM -- users don't own their books,If you think you own your Kindle books think again -- the sad reality is Amazon has a kill switch to remotely delete books off of Kindles. They used it to delete the George Orwell book 1984 earlier this year off some Kindle owners e-readers and led to a PR nightmare for Amazon. This only fueled the anti DRM movement which laid the case for why DRM is bad. Kindle books are Defective By Design! For more info if interested in learning more about DRM and how to stop it please visit[...] the website of the campaign to end all DRM!
4,Great Christian JAG book.,"If you like Christian military style books, you will enjoy ""Hostage"". ""Hostage"" picks up where ""Treason"" left off."
2,Decent tail; ruined by extreme pro christian right wing comments,"This author makes fun of Islam, and derides it. Worse, he appears to be a christian extremist. This constantly detracts from what is otherwise a decent tale. No character development. All the heroic Navy personnel are beautiful, so beautiful, it becomes funny. Not a good effort.Not recommended for anyone who likes subtlety."
1,Awful,"I downloaded the first four Don Brown books in this series for free for the Kindle, read Treason and then deleted them all since Treason was so terrible.I then became curious because of all the five star reviews of the other books in the series so I skimmed through the deleted copies on my Kindle (on a Kindle you never really delete anything, it just goes into your archive which is similar to the Windows trash can) to see if they were any different. Unfortunately they are all the same tediously boring, unimaginative drivel as Treason.I don't know what is going on with all these 5 star reviews but it seems very odd that a large percentage of them seem to be from reviewers where this is their only Amazon review. As Alice once said, ""curiouser and curiouser."""
3,A bit Boring,Compared to Don's other books I struggled to get through this book. I found it to be boring and long winded in places.
3,Solid black(ish) death metal EP,"1997's The Trollish Mirror is the debut EP from Swedish black/death outfit Amsvartner, and was released when the band members were still teenagers. Apparently the band started out with a more black metal style, but most of what you hear on The Trollish Mirror is Gothenburg-style melodic (well, somewhat melodic) death metal. It's very fast, very aggressive and very harsh, but there are also some melodic and atmospheric elements.Black metal fans expecting more of Amsvartner's demo-era sound are probably going to be disappointed with The Trollish Mirror, as only the lousy production job and some of the lyrical content point to the black metal genre. And as death metal releases go, this isn't terrible, but it's not anything special either. Pick it up out of curiosity if you see it in a dollar bin, but don't go hunting for it."
1,Can't recommend this gas can,"I'm a Brit living in America and so I'm used to the NATO style jerry cans. I bought one of these things thinking it was the same. It's not, it's the same size and shape, but that's all. It leaked through the big plastic threaded area from the second it held gas EVEN WITH THE RUBBER 'O' RING SECURELY IN PLACE. No matter how tight you try and do it up, gas oozes out. That's just dangerous.Also its got a bottom that's got some kind of cheap folded seam. Blitz seem to make great plastic cans, but these metal ones are poor design.If you want a metal Jerry can, find a NATO issue one, they have a big welded seam running around the whole can, there are countless European made brands and they're gas-tight and almost indestructable."
1,There are FAR better options for fuel cans,"I have used this ""BLITZ"" style can (with the screw on cap/nozzle) for many years with the same results -- leaks, fuel spills, seepage around the cap, etc...A few months ago, I purchased a NATO style Jerry Can made by Wedco from an Army Surplus store. These cans have a superior cam-over locking system on the fuel cap -- best of all THEY DON'T LEAK like the Blitz can. The cap and nozzle on the NATO style can make a positive seal. You can lay the can on its side, upside down, whatever -- and it won't leak. The only work of caution with the NATO style can is to make sure you get a filler nozzle that is vented -- there are some nozzles out there (galvanized steel with a flexible steel spout) that are not vented and take forever to empty with lots of ""glug, glug, glug)"". Wedco makes a vented spout designed for this style of can -- do youself a favor, spend a few extra bucks and get proper filler nozzle."
1,Leaked from day one,"I have used several of these over the years, and they all leaked. They leak past the rubber seal at the top when they are over 3/4 full. They leak when you are pouring fuel. I replaced the rubber seals to no avail.The NATO cans I got from British Pacific, on the other hand, never leak."
4,tough as nails and no leaks like its plastic cousin,the only problem i have had is the finish comes off too easy they could improve that and make it just a little more dent proof
2,Look for something else,"My girl got this and a 1 1/4 filler for me.. thing spills all over the place, unless I tip it to a certain angle. either way, look for something better. I'm going to look for something to seal this spout."
4,"Excellent book, but...","Hi...The content of this book is excellent in the field of analysis of variance. The only thing I do not like about this book, as many others book of today is the BINDING FORMAT.I like books strong and durable.Many children's books have a STRONG BINDING FORMAT of folded pages forming mini books sewed and glued at back.Why not apply this format to truly important books like this book?I'M SICK OF THESE WEAK BINDING FORMAT..."
5,Sheer joy!,"I happened upon Aria 2 after a trip to New York. While there I had gone to see the ""Sound of Music"" with Rebecca Luker in the role as Maria. I simply fell in love with her voice. And lo and behold, I am at the Virgin Records store and see that she sings on this album. Much create must be given to Paul Schwartz and his vision of meshing contemporary music with opera. In my impression, he has only heightened the experience for the broader audience. This is a ""not to be missed"" album."
5,Absolutely Amazing,"I picked up the first Aria CD and enjoyed only a few songs (but I still enjoyed it a lot). I picked up Aria 2 and was totally blown away. This album from beginning to end is just incredible. I am not an opera fan, yet I can't seem to put this album down! My favorite on this album has to be Ebben (Track 2). It's one of those songs that just puts a smile on your face. I highly recommend adding this album to your collection!"
2,Not great....,"After hearing the clips of the CD on this website, I thought I would like the CD. But there is one thing you can't tell from the 30-second clips: the fact that these songs go on FOREVER! At a few points, I was seriously tempted to take the disk out and fling it like a frisbee across the room. Not that the songs are that bad in themselves. It just seems that they (the musicians, composers, etc.) didn't know when enough was enough."
1,"Boring, Simply Boring","A mediocre attempt to combine Classical and Beat - More like a commercial attempt to sell on the success of the first which I have not heard myself but know it was a hit. I was dissapointed to find that it is the same vocalist for every piece and wonder if this is the format of the first CD. No real elevation of style or ingenuity. I love Gorecki Symphony No. 9 which was a pop hit in Europe a few years ago and really is remarkable. It is not a dance song but an incredible contemporary, dream-like piece with real talent. If Aria 2 keeps selling it will be because of folks who bought the first and loved it or gamblers like me who are willing to waste precious earnings based on so-called Reviews here on Amazon."
5,Masterful hybrid of classical and contemporary sounds,"This is one of the most refreshing CDs I have bought in along time. The compositions are incredibly well crafted from start to finish. The variety of styles and clever combination of opera and ""techno beat"" create an extraordinary soundscape that is full of treasures and surprises."
5,This is an incredible albulm.,"This is without a doubt one of the best albulms that I have come across in a long time. As someone who likes opera, but can not listen to it for long periods of time, it was great to come across an albulm which for want a better word ""contemporarizes"" opera by adding upbeat music to classic arias. I kept listening to the songs again and again. This is a must have albulm."
3,Rebecca Luker...the voice of ARIA....not enough on this one!,"I love the 1st and 3rd Aria, but the 2nd one is a bit of a downer. Rebecca Luker makes the music soar, no one else can do it like her....so..what happened to her in the rest of the CD?3 stars isn't bad, but this CD isn't over-the-top like the first one..."
4,Aria ROCKS!,"Listeners may recognize the second track as the tune from the French film ""DIVA"". On this record however it sounds as if sung by the Diva from the sci fi film ""THE 5TH ELEMENT"".I think that if you like Enigma then you will like Aria.I very much enjoyed the first Aria album as well as this, the second. I'm hoping for more in the future."
2,A little short on details,The book discusses the major features of DB2 V8 but tends to gloss over them without providing the details or real world examples.I have also purchased the Advanced DBA Cert Guide for DB2 V8 and find it contains a lot more detail and information as well as real world examples.
1,So Let's Die Already,"With the continued study of the Christian bible, blatent mistranslations and lexicon jobs are more hard to come by. Here's a book where you can find them by the dozen. Having studied this book and the rest of Yisrayl's collected works, I have come to the conclusion that the only inevitable END will belong to The House of Yahweh. The book seems to only be useful for brainwashing and is written much in the style of Anton LeVay, the author of the Satanic Bible. Those of us who at some point believed this book have been waiting for the past ten years for this ""three year period"" to end. So let's get it over with."
4,"A magnificent, unwieldly place to begin","For those interested in the sheer beauty of medieval illumination, this book is a wonder. Color repro values among the best I've seen, and the range of both period and style is superb. The huge size and great weight are the only reasons this did not get 5 stars - it is so big that I clamp it in my portable easel when I'm using it as an exemplar.For those, like me, who also do illumination as a hobby this book offers a good range of exemplars of very high caliber. Just remember that this represents the best of many times and places, and don't be intimidated by the quality of the work displayed here. Codices Illustres is big enough to be a coffee table book, but is serves much better as a reference in the scriptorium.YIS,THL Ragnar Ketilsson"
5,What I expected,Everything was great from the purchase to when I received the item. It was exactly what I was looking for. Great price and great shipment timing. It is helping me plan from the beginning to the end.
2,Good Idea For A Book But Needs Work,"This was a much needed book, but the research was pretty shoddy. Attributing a quote from Teddy Roosevelt to John Kennedy is a minor one, but identifying Geoffrey Keyes as a commander of the 1st Special Service Force? It makes me wonder what else is incorrect. The writing is confusing with the lyrics to the Ballad of the Green Berets making an appearance for some odd reason. The bibliography isn't even in alphabetical order. Like I said, this is a great idea for a book, but the author needs to go back to the drawing board."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"Really was looking forward to reading this book.Found too much bull! Looked like they got together a bunch of material & put it together without checking it out.Example would be Mike Echanis..Eastern Arts helped heal him....try Steriods & weights!!Lee traind him....try Randy W.Randy also took the pics & set up the BLACK BOOK!!Found more mistakes in the book! As stated ""Save your $$Jim"
4,Interesting historical work on the Soviet System,"This book presents the results of assessing the social and psychological strengths and weaknesses of the Soviet system based on a unique body of informationinterviews with hundreds and questionnaires administered to thousands of refugees from the Soviet Union, in Europe and in the United States, in 1950-1. These data were produced for the Harvard Project on the Soviet Social System, whose purpose was to utilize this particular source of information as a supplement to more ordinary avenues of knowledge of the Soviet system."
3,What's On? Bobby??,"I read the 5 star rave and bought this disk, but.. I have to say,I'm less than impressed. The thing that really hooked me in wasMontez Coleman on drums, who toured with Roy Hargrove recently, and he is a superb drummer. So the line up is great, and there are a couple of pretty hot numbers on the CD.. so it's not a complete bummer. But, Bobby's done better, such as Horizon Reassembled, or the Inventor. The problem is the selection of tunes, and some originals are just repetitive, and boring. I mean, why record ""I've gotta be me"", unless..you're gonna turn the cliche into something sublime. It just doesn't cut!"
1,Unreadable book,"OK, it contains a lot of topics and might be a bible of the subject. But it is simply unreadable and almost impossible to be used for seld study, OK I know Mr. Genius you will stop me here to say you did but I meant regular people like me. In addition to that, it's poorly organized.It can be taken as a reference after learing the subject from two or three texts since it has a lot of information."
2,"Some nice examples, poorly organized","This is probably a very nice text book if you already know probability. There are undeniably some insightful examples. However, it is often hard to follow the sequence of topics in the book.It is at least amusing that the integral is only developed a couple of chapters after expectation has been in use..."
3,Probability Theory Bible,"""Probability and Measure"" by P. Billingsley covers a lot of topics in probability theory, and in this sense it is a standard reference, but what I did not like much is that the concepts are somewhat scattered around the book, so one has to jump back and forth all the time. (May be this is an artefact of my graduate course in probability theory that had topics in the syllabus ordered in a way different from Billingsley.) I found another book more useful and more clearly written -- see Borovkov et. al.Probability Theory(I cannot believe it is so overpriced though!!!!)"
5,Talk about memories.,"When I was a child, road trips were a summertime ritual. The Wee Sing cd's (tapes at the time) were a large portion of the soundtrack of my summers. If we were going nuts in the car, my mother would pop in a Wee Sing tape and we were suddenly glued to our seats singing along with the tape. As we learned to read, we learned to use the book that came with the tape if it had survived the three of tugging at it. As we got older, we lost or forgot about the tapes.My first niece was born early this spring, and one of the first things that popped into my head was that she HAD to have the Wee Sing's. This was part of the first of what I hope will be many that she owns. The appeal of the songs has a wide age range; while it is appropriate for my newborn niece to listen to in the car, it also makes an excellent tool for my wife's 5th grade social studies class. I am so excited that this series is still around and growing!"
5,Great!,"Great songs for kids. Easy to follow, both musically and visually. Would recommend this product to anyone who wants their kids to sing about their nation's history."
1,"Sing America, but don't make it here",The book was made in China and the CD made in Singapore. What a joke. I threw this in the trash where it belongs.
5,A tough jerry can holder.,"I bought this gas can holder for my 1946 CJ2A Jeep. I bolted it on and it's sat outside for over a year in all sorts of weather from snow and temps down to -30F to blazing sun with a temp around 100F, not to mention strong winds and endless rain this spring here in South Dakota. So far it has not faded and I had not seen any signs of rust. The supplied securing strap looked flimsy so I used a military surplus one instead."
5,The ultimate gas can carrier,I own the Blitz 5-gallon can and ya need a place to hang it on your 4x4 and this is it.
4,Tim,"I bought this as an addition to my Jeep that I attached it on to hold a Jerry can as original Jerry Can holders can be pretty high priced, depending on where you look. This one was lightweight and I repainted it Olive Drab and attached it to my CJ Wrangler...which has also been re-painted olive drab. All it all, this worked out well for me! The vintage ones ( real WW2, Korea and Vietnam era ) seem to be heavier but this worked out fine. All in all, I'm content...thought the price might be a tad high though. It pays to shop around!"

2,Mix of good and fair software,"This software has some good and fair software mixed together. The Strawberry Shortcake CD was confusing to both my 5 yr old and myself! If I had paid attention and saw the Dora Explorer CD was part of the box, I would have not purchased it at all."
3,dumping the baby with the bath water,"Mahmood has a pleasant, easy-going style, which makes for good reading. She makes every effort in her ethnographic work to put herself into the place of the women of the mosque movement. She seems to look at the situation from the presupposition that people are purely products of their circumstances, which precludes much in the way of personal choice. I prefer to believe we do have choice. While I respect the choice these women have made, I think it would be a mistatke to assume that there's no coersion or oppression in their lives. That is, it's fine to accept the choices people make, but oppression is still oppression. Yes, let's see things as much as we are able from the subject's point of view, but lets not pretend oppression and subjugation aren't still oppression and sujugation."
5,THE BEST,"My daughter is now 10 years old. When she was younger, we played this music over and over and over. Recently, while looking to buy a gift for a young friend, we remembered this music. We both could recall many of the songs and enjoyed sharing how wonderful it is written, sung and produced. I would recommend this to every child as a fun way to learn the sounds of the alphabet. In a world of so much garbage, it is wonderful to have a little high quality gem in children's edutainment."
1,Sadly disappointing,"Despite a promising product description, the content of this toddler Bible disappoints greatly.. in fact, it misses out Christianity. Jesus is just a 'special baby' who goes on to work miracles; and there is not even a hint of his death and resurrection. Why include the minor account of David and Goliath but miss out the Resurrection of our Lord? For toddlers, Helm's ""The Big Picture Story Bible"" is a much better choice: http://www.amazon.com/The-Picture-Story-Bible-Book/dp/1433523914"
3,fair show,This DVD had some good moments and some not so good. overall it was an OK experience. I wish that it was longer an had some more comediens.
2,not a very good book,"This book has numerous typos, incomplete sentances and formatting problems. The bulk of the content is in the form of inconclusive scientific formulas with poor descriptions of their significance. They are not tangible to anyone without a PhD in quantum physics and mathematics, and many of them are quite simply incorrect. Zero Point energy is a truly fascinating topic and there are many excellent books about it, but this one just barely gets to stay in my library, simply as a collection of detailed formulas, some of which are very good and some of which are not."
3,Yet another book to satisfy the author's ego.....,"No, it is not ""practical"", but the usual collection of information which can be found on the internet. Nice to have it in a book form, but nothing you won't read elsewhere."
2,Only good for advanced Physicists,"This book was prepared more for the Physics teachers at a university level than for average people who are expecting to get information they can work with.The information is strictly dealt with at a research level, and not at a practical level as the title intimates. The examples cited deal with many particles at a molecular and nano level, not very useful for the backyard scientist.Example ;vacuum polarization is, however, a relativistic effect involving electron positron pairs as the hole-theoretic interpretation assumes; a electrostatic field causes a redistribution of charge in the Dirac sea and thus polarizes the vacuum. Okay, so i'm dumb! Paul"
4,Pleasant Surprise!!!,"I have been playing guitar for 49 years and have over 80 guitars in my collection. I was not expecting much for a guitar that cost just under $85. The guitar plays incredibly well, there are no sharp frets, the intonation is perfect, it stays perfectly in tune, and the sound is as good as any guitar costing three to four times as much. The only problems I saw were a small finish flaw-barely noticeable, the nut on the neck was slightly offcenter-I fixed it, and there was a strap missing on the gig bag--I purchased a hardshell case because gigbags are worthless. This can be used for practice as well as small gigs."
5,An Important Piece,I fell in love with this marvelous book the moment I opened it. There are so many beautiful spiritual truths between the covers of this uniquely special book. I have passed this one on to a rare and unusual couple because spirit led me. Do yourself a favor and purchase and treasure the truths that are laid out before you.
5,What we all need!,"Reading this book opened my eyes to the realization that there are certain things needed for a man and woman to successfully communicate in a relationship. Though, like many, I thought I'd weathered the storm and been thoroughly prepared, I found that there were a number of things I needed to improve upon.Having met Sobonfu, I can only say that she embodies what she's written. Reading a book has a different affect on you once you've met the author. The spirit she exemplifies is the one she writes about in the book.My suggestion is to buy it, read it, and then tell all your friends and family to do the same. Don't do Sobonfu an injustice by borrowing or loaning this book. Give her her just rewards buy purchasing your own copy. It's worth every cent and then some."
2,A distorted view of The Family,"Anyone reading this book must be careful not to accept at face value the conclusions Chancellor reaches about this extreme, fundamentalist, high-demand group. The methodology he used in writing this book is flawed, and so the picture he paints of this dubious new religious movement/cult is very distorted. The Family practices a doctrine referred to as ""deceivers yet true,"" which they use to deceive outsiders as to their true nature and intentions, including scholars like Chancellor. Even the editors of this website have accepted Chancellor's claims in the book that The Family has changed for the better.I strongly urge any reader of this book to do their own investigation of The Family on the internet, and not just blindly accept what Chancellor says about it. They will be shocked to learn the true nature of The Family, and it is not as Chancellor makes it appear."
2,nice hat BUT beware of hidden costs,"Nice hat, but taken to town on the shipping charge. Order included 3 hats from this vendor and even tho they sent all together they charged me X3 when each hat's shipping charge would have covered the ENTIRE costs, this practice makes the hat cost prohibitive. It is not the reasonable price it appears!"
2,A Meandering Muddle,"This meandering travelogue is theoretically framed by the author's quest to discover the provenance of a particular style of embroidered amulet, but doesn't really hold together well. Paine is a multi-lingual expert on embroidery who recounts her fours trips, encompassing regions in India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Turkey, Iraq, and finally Bulgaria, in her attempt to track down the source of the amulet. While she is decent in giving local color and impression, she is awful at conveying the progress of her quest. When she does manage to talk to someone who knows something, the conversation is presented as a series of incomprehensible non-sequiturs. It's best to skim over anything about the textiles, for what is more interesting is her experience as a 62-year old English woman traveling solo through some rather dicey areas at the time of the Gulf War and the new independence of Afghanistan (which is the only country where she is assaulted)."
5,"Weird, but it works","You've never heard anything quite like Beauty in the Beast, and it *does* take some getting used to. But once you have, it's a must-have record.There are a variety of musical styles on BitB, ranging from african-sounding percussion to martian jazz. The title cut is just plain haunting.The supplementary files include an essay on tuning, with audio files as examples. I found these to be very informative, particularly regarding the alpha and beta scales used in the title cut.It's weird, but it works."
5,Un CD imperdible,"BitB es una de las mejores obras -sino la mejor- de W.Carlos. Su labor como teórica en los campos del microtonalismo y las afinaciones alternativas es abrumadoramente loable. Pero no sólo construye o descubre escalas de afinación distintas a la tradicional 12 ET occidental, a la que estamos acostumbrados, sino que, como ella dice ""hizo su propio pastel y se lo comió"", es decir, habiendo construido las bases, los recursos, hace uso de ellos de una manera asombrosa, con fragmentos pregnantes dignas del mejor compositor. C'Est Afrique, Beauty in the Beast, Poem for Bali, son preciosas. Particular atención merece Just Imaginings, pues aquí, la labor teórica y musical de Carlos alcanzan niveles altísimos."
3,Brain Damage,"Instinctively attracted to classical music I have been unable to listen to this work without becoming physically ill. Constant shifts in tonality make this an interesting case study from a pathological standpoint but don't expect to enjoy it. This is music that has lost the center. There is no harmonic whole, there can be no cycle of fifths, scientifically justifiable yet all is arbitrary. This is the opposite of loop based music and the ultimate 'special effects' driven experiment. If you want non tempered classical music I recommend Harry Partch or Moon Dog or one of the more staid composers of modern music. Get this CD by all means. You won't be dissapointed."
2,"Great voice, horrible recording","Don't get me wrong, I am a huge fan of Sarah Brightman's, but this CD was just a disappointment. I don't know if it was the quality of the recording or what, but I had to turn the volume on my stereo up pretty high to even hear her and what she was singing. This was recorded with her ""young"" voice and only a piano backing her up. Overall, this was NOT one of her best releases."
2,Think before you buy,"Just because you have liked all of her recordings doesn't mean you will like this one. I enjoy filk , folk, and classical music but I still did not like this CD. To me all of the tracks on this sound the same... The songs are very slow, very high, and somewhat uninteligible. This is not a Brightman version of John Renborn, Leife and Leige, etc. Think before you buy."
1,Wrong songlist for this title...,"The songlist for this cd is completely wrong... The actual list is: 1. Doxy, 2. I Remember Clifford, 3. Dear Old Stockholm, 4. Mr. Bowtie, 5. On the Sunny Side of the Street, 6. I Fall In Love Too Easily, 7. Mack the Knife, and 8. I Got It Bad. The songs are still great but not what you are expecting to purchase. The songlist shown is for Charles Earland's ""If Only for One Night"" cd."
2,Why?,I read this book trying to understand why so many people were trying to get out of Asian countries. I came away only understanding that the authors felt that they weren't treated like royalty in the west when they arrived. But why were they leaving in such huge numbers in the first place? What is so wrong in Asian culture that so many people want out? In America they make more money than everybody else. This book doesn't look at any difficult questions. It left me thinking that it was somewhat like a Chinese dinner. Seemingly there's a lot there but after about ten minutes you're hungry again.
3,not a fan of the sax but done tastefully...,"my header should let you know my bias against sax. i would have rated this a 4 or 5 otherwise. had to puchase it just to hear one of the Iona side projects. that being said my bias should not detract from anyone who does like sax music or simply excellent simple but nuanced instrumental. also, David plays a lot more of the flute on this album than the sax just for the record. if you like this and you have never heard Iona you should look into them. if you like the instrumental- and espeically mellower more wind instrument- side of Iona you will like this CD."
5,This is a wonderful analysis of classical music today.,"This book takes a unique look at the classical music world of today. Norman Lebrecht has combined historical evidence as well as researched evidence to declare the truth about the condition of classical music today. It is, as a modern historical account, quite stunning. And for one overly romantic about classical music today, this book dispels much of that kind of though. You learn about Pavarotti's greed, the sexualization of female stars, and down-right dirty underhanded agents. It's a must-read for all classical music lovers."
1,Not the classic version recorded by Ustinov,If you're looking for the humorous Ustinov version this is NOT it! This is not the classic performance conducted by Karajan. It lacks all the whimsical touches that made that one so great. This version is conduced by Ellis with the Philharmonia Orchestra. Too bad the good Karajan version doesn't appear ever to have been issued on CD.
2,GH's Michael Saucedo,"I watch General Hospital, and that's where I first heard the song. I hated the song the first and the second time, but the third or fourth time it grew on me a little...but just a little."
5,Lightweight steel toe,"this shoe is awesome for work!!! light weight and comfortable. Ive owned red wings,wolverine, danners and this shoe blows them all away for a half there price. nice square toe leaves you room and they have not eatin my socks either as we know steel toe boots do.Nice to work 12 hours on concrete and not have your feet hurt the whole time."
1,Disappointment,"The shoe seemed to be everything I could hope for. A slip on safety shoe. However, what at first was a stiff fit developed into a nagging pain in a matter of days. Within 2 weeks I had to stop wearing them for fear of not being able to walk at all. Very disappointing."
2,they don't fit.,I am 50 years old and I have taken a size 10 1/2 wide for 35 years. these shoes feel about 1 size too small and the inside edge of the steel toe digs into the top of my foot. I guess this is one of the problems with ordering shoes on line.
2,not so adventurous,"This is pretty ponderous stuff.. definitely not the Electric Acid Kool Aid Test. The Author's claim to having invented hip hop should be filed next to Al Gore's claim to have invented the internet. The rest of the book is about 60s hippie culture in the 80s, conspiracies, and pot. It's a lot of the same stuff High Times writes about, so if you read High Times, you've heard this stuff before. It doesn't cover any of the real 80s counter culture like skateboarding and alternative rock. For a real 80s counterculture book check out Dogtown or Get in the Van.. This is for hippies, and even so, it's not very well done."
5,Dyno=mite,"This book covers a breadth of vital experiences among the counter-culture and is must reading for those that care about the true history of our age. Steve gets to the crux of many places and times where the subtle actions of a few individuals spreads out to the real world of culture, human interactions and become forces upon the world stage by sheer beneficence. An enduring work covering what the mainstream either ignores or gives skimpy, stereotyped coverage."
3,Received silica gel but no holder,"The seller did a great job of sending large silica gel, but I did not receive the rectangular holder as indicated in the picture. To be fair, I have not contacted the seller and did not look at the original description of the product."
2,8 Editions and still incorrect,I am a professional engineer. I have been working for over 25 years in the metals fabrication field of Aerospace and Automotive.I am appalled at the cost of this book and the number of editions it has gone through and not had the errors corrected!I've reviewd 3 additional texts while in this course of study and found them to be superior in content and quality of explanation. I would not recommend this text to instructors.
1,One of the worst textbooks I've used.,"I'm an engineering student currently going to school in Utah. This book is one of the worst I've used. The sections give hardly any explantation on the subjects they are trying to teach. The examples have hardly any relevancy to the problems. Some of the equations in the front cover are wrong. And the answers in the back of the book are wrong quite often.My biggest complaint is with the actual sections. They do little more than offer proofs for the equations that go with the new material, then send you on your merry way. All fine and dandy, but I'd like a little more explanation given, such as when I can't use an equation given some circumstances. I've wasted many, many hours on problems because the equations I've used were the wrong ones to use.If you have to use this book, get the solutions manual. It will save you a lot of time and stress."
1,Worst Dynamics Textbook Ever!,This is the worst textbook I have ever used. The discussion is brief and shallow at best and examples are simplified. The examples provide no foundation for working the problems. The book is also full of errors. You would think after 9 editions the book would be correct!
3,Review,I had to order this book for my Statics and Dynamics class at the University of Michigan. The book is decent but is nothing special. There are a great deal of practice problems and a sufficient amount of examples. The information is pretty clear but I feel it could be described in a better manner than made things easier to comprehend.
3,Not as good as his true story of his life.,"It isn't exactly what I anticipated after readin Cell 2455, Death Row. I would say that he had talent and a shame that it wasted in his poor choices in life."
4,Very Good second offering,"Every once in a while, a group of extremely talented musicians gets together and produces something equal to all their individual talents. Tangent has done this not only once, but twice now. I personally prefer the first CD - ""The Music That Died Alone"" to this one, but that's just my preference. This is a very,very good followup and will not disappoint those who enjoyed their first CD. Just my own bias, but if you're considering buying a Tangent CD and haven't yet - consider ""The Music That Died Alone"" for your first exposure. I believe that after you enjoy that Progressive masterpiece, it's easier to appreciate their work here."
4,Great Folk Music,I chose this DVD because I like Pete Seeger and Doc Watson. I had heard of The Stanley Brothers but did not know much about them. This is another Rainbow Quest show from the 1960s
4,Pete Seeger's Rainbow Quest - Stanley Brothers and Doc Watson,"I bought this DVD because it is the only one that I found that had Carter and Ralph Stanley. I think it's a great DVD. It's taken from Pete's show in the 60's so it's in black and white and not of great visual quality, but given that it's from that era, it's fine with me. The DVD also has a session with Doc Watson which is really great. He does Way Downtown, St. James Infirmary and a gospel song and has a nice interview with Pete. Cousin Emmie is also on the DVD and Pete does several songs that I liked. I really like the format of the show and wish that there was a modern-day equivalent, but it would be really hard to find someone like Pete Seeger to host it."
1,to much Pete,"To much of Pete Seegar, and so little DOC AND STANLEY BROS!!!! plus pete seegar is awfull.. a lil less of pete in the video would be ok! (alot less!!)"
2,Where are the Stanley Brothers and Doc Watson?,"The Stanley Brothers/Doc Watson DVD of their appearances on Rainbow Quest arrived at my home last week, but the DVDcontained the Johnny Cash/Roscoe Holcomb appearances instead.The Cash/Holcomb material will appeal to old time and rootsmusic afficienados, but will disappoint those like myself whohad expected to receive the correct program material."
3,"Good concept, needs technical rework","The concept is great, in that there are two parts to the joystick that swivel. So it switches from right-hand to left-hand, depending upon whether your child is right-handed or left-handed. Unfortunately, the joystick can have somewhat of an awkward feel in your hands. More bothersome is that the joystick can be somewhat jerky at times, and non-responsive at others. I find this a little frustrating, and you can imagine how my four-year-old finds it."
1,Only fun when it works!,"The on/off buttons are a joke. We are now on our second Vsmile. I thought maybe the kids did something to the first Vsmile, but lo and behold the on switch only works when it wants to. There are many times when you have to restart the system because it freezes in the middle of a game. I haven't had trouble with the joysticks like many others, but overall I would caution anyone away from the product. Too bad, too, because if it would work for more than a week or two, I would give this system 5 stars!"
4,Joystick is fine,We too got Vsmile by Vtech for our boys for Christmas. My boys ages 6 years and 3 years love it. Since this is the only game that has a joystick they are not complaining about it at all. I think that this joystick is just fine for those beginning on video/educational games.
4,Not necessary,"I bought the second joystick so my children, 2 and 5, could take turns playing. It has proven not necessary. You only need one joystick at a time and the game tells you when it is player one's or player two's turn."
2,Poor Quality,"We purchased the Vsmile for my 4 year old daughter for Christmas. She has only played the Vsmile a few times since we have been out of town since Christmas, but when we tried to play the game again, the joystick is completely dead. I can't believe I will have to buy another joystick so soon after buying the console. I would think Vtech would have made these more durable. I can't believe that my 4 year old is so brutal that she was able to break this controller on her own. I am curious-has anyone else had this problem?"
2,Nice games but qulaity is questionable,"My son received the v smile system from ""Santa"" and absolutely enjoys the games. However the system itself is testy when switching games and the on/off buttons do not function correctly over half the time. The joystick is another whole issue, as it has recently, after 2 months of light use, ceased to work. The batteries have been replaced in the game unit & still nothing. The game is now collecting dust as I try to decide if I want to spend anymore $$ on a product that is less than the quality piece I was expecting. I would say that the games are educational & fun, but they do us no good if you can't play them... purchase at your own risk."
2,not that special nor that great,"Yes, this joystick can be switched easily from right to left- handedness. However, that is where the intrigue ends. You don't need a second stick for this system. The buttons are easy to use and durable, but the stick is too sensitive and creates action on the games that, for my 3 year old, is too fast and quirky for her to follow (e.g. in selecting menus she doesn't have the same fine motor skills I do, and easily passes over the item she is trying to select). This can even be difficult for an adult at times. Tell you what, lose the video games, sit down with your child and do it the old fashioned way. It is more engaging to do so than with this device."
2,malfunctioned joystick,My son got his V-smile for Christmas and started using it just the beginning of January. He really liked playing with it until the joystick malfunctioned. It's only about 2 weeks since he started using it. Now I'm in a dilemma of buying a new one with the hope that it'll last.
1,V. Smile,My little cousin said it went way too fast. She didn't even have time to click the answer.signed an 11 year old with a problem
5,playtime,I PURCHASED THIS FOR MY GRANDKIDS THEY JUST LOVE IT THEY PLAY IT ALL THE TIME WHEN THEY ARE HERE AT MY HOUSE. THANK YOU.
3,Kids Don't Really Care for It,Maybe your kids can use joysticks with no issue. Well my daughter couldn't. She would probably do better with it now that she's a little older but the console itself stopped working about a year after we bought it. Complete waste of money. My daughter didn't learn a thing from using the console because she struggled with the controls nearly the entire time.
2,Joysticks are very poor quality,I have had no problems with the game system or any of the games but we have gone through 3 different joysticks in less than a year. My son takes very good care of his game system and joysticks and he dosent' really use them all that much. I am going to try the v-smile pocket so he can still play his games but I refuse to shell out anymore money on these crappy joysticks that only last a few months.
5,Sharp looking bakeware,I really like this bakeware. It is really pretty and serves up your dishes to look great. I particularly like the black. Love it!
2,I Love Deb...but come on!,"I am a huge fan of Deborah Gibson, and had heard only good things about this single. Let me warn you - unless you are the biggest Deb Head, do not buy this. ""Naturally"" is good and from her excellent album ""Deborah"" but the other three tracks, different versions of ""My Girlfriend's Boyfriend"" are just horribly pop-tastic. I like pop music, but this is just crazily poppy, way more than anything by Britney (if you can believe that - and yes, I *do* like Britney!). There are also some really, *really* bad pictures of Deb in here. She's looks like a close relative of Amy Fisher inside. Scary. I love Deb, and she's so pretty, but these pics and songs do absolutely nothing for her. And I only tell the truth."
1,Do Not Download This MP3 Album,"Do NOT download this album or some of the individual tracks. Several tracks are cut off before the end. For example, Track one ends before the singing ends. Track two contains the end of Track 1. There are other similar problems on other tracks. Amazon issued me a full refund and they are aware of the problem. This same album is sold on other web sites and it has the same problem when downloaded. I do not have the CD so I cannot tell if this a problem with the MP3 version or the remastered CD. If anyone has a source for this CD that provides a correct version, I would appreciate the information."
2,Verdi's Mass,"To be honest, I'm a bit disappointed by this piece. It's the first time I've heard it so I'm not sure whether it's the recording or the music itself, but it goes from being almost inaudible in places, to practically blasting you out of your chair, with little moderation in between. Some of the choral parts are certainly beautiful, and the four sacred pieces that follow the Mass on the CD are enjoyable too, with some lovely harmony. I guess I just had higher expectations based on Verdi's operas, and on other Masses and Requiems that I love (Mozart for example) so I wasn't as pleased with Verdi's Mass as I'd thought I might be."
3,"Warm, fuzzy charm","Some songs are really great, others are mediocre, but it's worth it for the great ones.With a warm, fuzzy, summer cruising charm this album won't win the listener over at first, but it will soon be finding its way into your head and your car stereo with great frequency."
4,"Good ""safe"" product","The product will fool most people. After we added items inside, the foam padding prevented those items from making a lot of noise. As a result, there was no way to know that it wasn't just a can of Desenex."
2,not what you think,"This is a great diversion however there wasnt enough padding inside to quiet the items that were place within it. It has padding on one end of the can, and its towards the top. I was under the impression there would be padding surrounding all sides. And to top it all off, there isnt one drop of desenex in the can. It is bone dry, which makes the can super light. If your spouse were to pick this can up he/she would definitely think it to be empty and discard it. I myself had to add my own padding and place it somewhere it would not be seen. This product wouldnt fool anyone ""in my opinion""."
1,Smells like toxic chemical,"The product is a neat idea, but the inside of the can smells like a toxic chemical. It's probably the foam padding. Don't get this if you don't want your jewelry or money or whatever else to smell like a toxic chemical. For me this item is unusable. I tried leaving it open for several days to air it out, but that was no help.More and more of the things we buy smell terrible, and I just wonder whether it has to do with fact that nearly everything we get now is made in China, and China is one of the largest consumers of recyclable material, and in some cases the process to retrieve usable materials is extremely toxic. I believe this product was assembled in the USA, but I don't know where the foam padding came from."
5,Great item for the price,"I just got this in the mail and I am very happy with the purchase. It looks just like a normal can of footspray and is plenty big for dollar bills and other similarly sized items. Amazon had quick shipping too, great buy!"
2,Product is Defective,"I had this product for over 6 months. It worked well when it did, but the tooth brush broke after regular wear and tear. I never used the flosser. I agree with the previous consumer review about the flosser being a waste of money. I don't recommend purchasing this product. Although, their customer service is extremely helpful, I encourage looking elsewhere for a electronic toothbrush. They hooked my up with a brand new replacement, but I don't think I'll use it. I'd sell it on Amazon, but I don't want to be cruel and lead someone else to buy this weak product."
2,Not meant for learning,"Some books are meant to teach, and to elucidate new material; this book is not one of them. It seems the purpose of this book was rather to record for prosperity all theorems related to Stochastic Calculus. Instead of developing any intuition on the subject, the author seems to think the purpose of writing is to use the most elegant proofs with the most modern of mathematical jargon. In short, the book consists of stated lemmas and theorems with terse, undeveloped proofs. This book will not teach you anything."
5,excellent compilation!,"This is an excellent selection of peter rauhofer mixes. It's the only chance to get some very rare mixes like the wonderful Depeche Mode's ""It's no good"". He's a great producer/remixer. This compilation is perfectly mixed! CAN'T WAIT FOR VOLUME 3!"
4,"Schau, schau, der Peter mixed herum (in fact, pretty well)","Ugh, ""It's No Good"" is a horrible track, even the remix can't rescue it. I thought overall the CD was an okay buy (especially if you already have Junior Vasquez Vol 2 ... get that first, if you don't have it already: two of the best tracks--by Size queen and Hans--overlap). Still, I loved the reworking of Falco's ""Der Kommissar"" into a club track (some of the vocals got thrown out) and ""My Urban Soul""."
5,A perfect undergound house mix-cd!,"A great retrospective of Peter Rauhaufer's remix work. Very moody yet distinctly showcasing what the 'Club 69 Future Mix' does to a music track! By far the best song is the re-working of Depeche Mode's ""It's No Good""."
2,Same o'l same,"There is almost no performer or group, for that matter,that I like everything they produce. I truly love Gospel style music but, this one has more than half that just isn't up to what I really enjoy. This is only one person's opinion and I am sure that this may be most appealing to others."
4,Great CD,"This is a great CD, what I expected from Ben Tankard. He is anointed to play the piano. I love the remake of ""Jesus Is Love"". This is a great CD to light a candle and just chill!"
1,Doesn't work,"This battery worked for about a week, after which it became unusable. The charger stoped charging it."
2,Replacement battery for Motorola RAZR V3,"Battery was too small, phone was shutting down all the time. Required a small piece of paper between the battery and the phone frame to hold it tightly into place."
3,Gamesmanship ...,Why don't these aftermarket battery suppliers include the capacity (in maH) for their battery ? A cheaper battery is really no bargain if it's only half the rating of it's competitor.
3,Ergh...,"I was excited to get a battery for such a low price, but then I was reminded that you get what you pay for. The Battery doesn't fit in the phone quite as well as the OEM battery, and when the battery is in the phone it sometimes loses power."
1,Complete waste of money,"I bought this battery from Amazon using Prime, hoping that the chances of getting a reputable product were improved. They were not. This was a complete waste of money. I charged the battery when received for over 24 hours. I disconnected the phone from the charger the second evening; before morning, the battery was completely discharged. WITHOUT A SINGLE CALL, THE BATTERY DISCHARGED IN LESS THAN 10 HOURS! Save yourself the aggravation -- and the money. If I could give zero stars, I would do it."
4,Works fine,No significant issues. Works in a Moto RAZR V3m. Battery life seems to be less than new; This battery has probably been left in storage for a while and deteriorated.
2,Weak battery,This new battery simply doesn't last very long. It is drained in normal usage more quickly than any other battery I've ever used. I end up using my phone plugged into its charger.
4,Great for food storage,"This works perfectly for my big bags of dog kibble and keeps it fresh and tasty. The only negative comments I have are that I ordered a purple one and received a blue one, and it does not come with a scoop as shown in ALL the pictures. But this is a great item, I may get another for cat food."
4,perfect for intended use,I am using them to store various grains and rice...this works very well as they stack will fit in a small space. I intend on purchasing 3 or 4 more in the near future.
2,"Good vac, poor build quality","Bought this vac to, among other things, clean out the window frames of a house. Had above-average suction, but after half an hour of work it got quite hot and suddenly quit functioning. After it cooled down for a few hours it spontaneously started working again, but the heat-up-then-quit-working scenario repeated after another half hour or so, and this time it stayed dead. I worked the thing fairly hard (those window frames were really dirty!) but not, I think, excessively hard---it was turned off at least 1/3 of the time I was working, and I cleared any clogs within a few seconds. This vac is a wimp -- all bark and no bite. I'm not the only one with this complaint, and I think it's fair to say there's too great a chance it will break before you break it in. (My mom has had a similar issue with a smaller Shark handvac as well.) Not recommended."
4,"Filters--a ""fine print"" issue","I've used this vacuum for two years and it is efficient. It does get hot (even when new) when the filter needs cleaning, which is often. Fine dirt accumulates in the HEPA filter and can't be removed by tapping so rinsing is necessary, with a 24-hr. drying time before reuse. Filters are available only from the manufacturer, so I called to order some and learned they are very expensive. I declined to purchase, and the customer service rep. was persistent. Only at the end of the conversation did she announce they were offering a special promotion of double quantity for the same price. That made me angry so I bought none."
3,Decent Vacuum for the Price but not perfect,Good suction power; accessory hose is too short; retractable power cord function fails after repetitive use; hepa filter is not rinsable (after i attempted this following the included instructions the hepa filter had mold growing on it)Replacement hepa filters are not cheap $25 for two at company website.
1,Disposable vacuum?,"I've had this for several years. Actually thought it was a good little vacuum for quick pickups. Easy to clean and the retractor mechanism works great. I need a replacement filter, though, and NO ONE has anything that fits this machine - not even Shark. They tend to change models frequently, then drop support on discontinued models. So, once you need to replace the filter, you will be simply throwing this out and buying a new one."
1,"If you want to buy a new vacuum in 2 weeks, this is for you.","This is the worst vacuum cleaner I've ever had. I wanted a handheld vac to get pet hair off my couches and carpeted stairs. It worked GREAT the first time I used it on the couches, though the fact that it got super hot after 5 minutes of use, and made as much noise as an airplane, did concern me somewhat. The second time we used it, about a week or so later, my husband was trying to vacuum our carpeted stairs to get pet hair out, and it kept getting clogged every 5 minutes, and after 20, it smelled like it was about to burst into flames from overheating. We're returning it and checking out a Eureka vac. I suggest you skip this one if you need a vac to do any real work for longer than 5 minutes, as one reviewer has already pointed out."
3,Not much bang for the buck.,"This little handheld vacuum is okay . . . I like it better than the cordless hand vac that I was using, but am somewhat underwhelmed by the wimpy suction power. I thought it would do a better job. I do like the turbo brush attachment, though, but find it much more useful when I attach it to the hose of my regular vacuum cleaner! :-) The Shark needs more power, bottom line."
4,"Helpful, but has mistakes","I bought this book as I was going on a trip to London. I have used other Rough Guide books in the past and I was satisfied. However, this book has mistakes that shouldn't be there because it is a new edition. I had the chance to verify them myself for I used it shortly after it came out. It will be the edition people will use for the next two years, so a little more cautiousness would not harm."
2,ridicuolously slanted polemic against parts of london,The Rough guide to london is the most biased guide book i have ever read. I really don't understand why one would put a political bias in a guide book - but Rob Humphreys seems obsessed with both bashing the Rich and the British Conservative party a as well as gossipping about peoples sex lives. Such things have no place in a guide book. I would suggest you look at the Lonely Planet Guide which is much much better.
5,Best Cycling Journalism I've Read,"This book is on a different level, artistically and intellectually, from most cycling journalism. I've read a bevy of Tour de France books and this is the best by far. It takes a different angle on professional cycling, the perspective of the domestique, to show you things about the sport that you would never learn reading yet another book about Lance or the other stars. The story of Victor Hugo Pena (now exiled from Lance, but riding with another team, Phonak) is far more representative of life in the peloton than that of the stars, and so tells you so much more about the cruel, beautiful sport of cycling."
3,"The good is very good, the bad is tedious.","The part of this book about Victor Hugo Pena and the Tour for this year is exceptional. It provides tremendous insight as to the amazing physical ability of Pena, who was participating as a domestique, although he was a champion cyclist himself.Victor's description of the pain during the time trial is classic. I may put that paragraph on my training room wall.However when the author goes into detail on the TDF route over the years, it becomes tedious and for me, meaningless. Who cares how many times the TDF went through village X?Then we get an interpretation of the tour and the history of France (if not all mankind) which lost me early on. Maybe these chapters should have been in another book.In summary, I'm glad I read the book. The good outweighed the ""not so interesting"" part."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I bought this DVD for my husband and 2 boys as a Father's Day gift & we were all quite disappointed. Instead of action-packed, it's amateur video clips & boring narration. Save your (...)"
1,Hard small peas,"I have enjoyed wasabi peas for some time. I usually purchase HAPI brand. Thes are produced in Thailand. Great taste, not too hot, large peas that are well coated and crispy rather than crunchy. However, they use artificial colors and palm oil.So I purchased Sunridge Farms brand, and found them to be very hot which is not so bad, but the peas are very small and very hard. It is a chore to eat them."
5,Naruto,Great to keep up with the action and storyline. Nice to see Naruto`s progress in his quest to become a great warrior and to find his friend Sasuke.
4,Naruto Shippuden: set eleven,The DvD was transported without incident. It proved playable on our current DvD player and was very entertaining to view.
4,Probaly the last I will buy for a long time.,"This set covers mainly the battle between Jiraiya vs pain, and Itachi vs sasuke. I don't like to buy viz media dvd's because they are over priced for so few episodes. I only decided to purchased this and the previous set because these episodes are my favorite of the series. I know that this hurts but, If you people are expecting viz to bring the price down or release more episodes per dvd then you would most likely wait until the series end before they rerelease this."
5,Artfully written,"A Dash of Style is a well-written and necessary book full of gems for every writer or would-be writer. Reading the book was a pleasure in itself. It has increased my ability to write well and practicing the writing assignments has improved my writing considerably! Although these are rules and writing skills one learned or should have learned in school, this book provides an enjoyable review of writing helps that are turning my previously written pieces into masterpieces. Thank you, Mr. Lukeman!"
2,"A Dash of Style: The Art and Mastery of Punctuation, Not with this book","This book is not nearly detailed enough and handles only the basics. If you want more than what to do with a period or comma, get a textbook."
5,Thank you Noah Lukeman!,"This book is wonderful! If only punctuation had been explained to me like this earlier in life. I would have never believed that I could find a book about punctuation to be riviting, but I could not put it down. I highly reccomend this book to anyone (not just writers) that would like to have a better understanding of when, where, how and why to use punctuation. This book will never leave my writing desk! NEVER!"
1,You can't all be that gullible!,"It is surprising that all these folk wrote such relentlessly positive reviews of this very slight effort: perhaps they were paid to do so. Mr. Lukeman could have reduced this treatise by half, at least, but then it would have been a mere (unpublishable?) pamphlet; he - or an editor - could also have improved the accuracy. His repeated misuse of the verb ""belie"" has already been noted, and one wonders whether he is cognizant of the ways in which the uses of the colon and semi-colon differ: apparently not. Furthermore, the sections entitled ""What your use of [insert mark of punctuation] reveals about you"" are presumptuous and insulting."
