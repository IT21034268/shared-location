1,"What a waste of time, money and patience!","If this toy's object is to teach children that life is full of disappointments, this is the one to get! Ours didn't come with any instructions, so I got them off the internet from the manufacturer. Not only was this toy difficult to use, but it takes at least an hour to produce a mouthful of sloppy slush. Don't waste your time or money. You will have a very unhappy child to boot."
2,Slushee review,"Don't waste your money. It is very hard to figure out, doesn't work half the time, and you will not get the slushee you would expect. Very disappointing."
1,Does not work,"Got this for my kids for Christmas. Despite our best efforts (including crushing the ice by hand before putting it into the Maker), it just does not work. Nothing came out but a few drops of melted ice. The kids were very disappointed."
1,a missleading toy!!,"I bought this for my daughter- this was such a waste of our time- it does not work- the soda froze to the bottom of the canister it didn't make one slush and an adult has to hold the base while another adult cranks it for more then 4 minutes to get an ice cold drink.please don't waste your time , money or energy on this one it is a DUD!!!!"
1,I don't like to drink plastic shreds,"My son wanted this for Christmas more than anything. We got it for him and on Christmas attempted to make a slushie with it.Assembling the machine is not easy. Once you fill the can part with ice, it's very difficult to get the ice stirrer to stay in place. Then the main lid on top is difficult to get latched on (even for an adult)Once it was latched on it started to work a little bit. But while turning the crank it began rubbing off pieces of plastic which fell right into the drink.The area around the hand crank got warm and smelled of burnt plastic.We couldn't even try it to see how it tasted because of the plastic shavings it deposited in our slushie YUCK! What a disappointment! Also we got ours at Target and the box said there was a coupon for a LARGE Icee inside but there was a coupon for a SMALL icee inside. SMall icees are about 1/4 the size of a large icee. False advertising there, Target."
1,IT DOESN'T WORK! - DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,We bought the Slushee Maker for son for the holidays. My wife and I felt as if we were having a work out trying to get this contraption to make a shlushee. We followed the directions specifically and all we wound up with was COLD FLAT SODA! this was after many many minutes of turning the handle over and over again while my wife held the machine down with all of her might. It doesn't work and I cannot believe a product can be sold for [$$$] which doesn't not work at all. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! Now it is washed and sits in my son's closet serving absolutely no purpose what so ever. It's as if we threw our money away.
4,good slushees and easy to clean,My daughter received this as a Christmas gift. She is a little young for it but still likes it. Parents will end up doing all of the cranking on it anyway. We used an orange soda and it discolored the auger a little which isn't really a big deal. I would recommend using a pre-chilled beverage because it takes a little longer for it to freeze if it is not already cold. The thing I really like about it is that it is really easy to disassemble and clean and doesn't take a rocket scientist to put it back together. Not an educational toy but a fun thing to do together with friends or family.
4,I'm satisfied,"I found the instructions right inside the box on top of the toy. They were clear and easy to follow. I think you would have trouble getting it to work properly if you don't have and follow the instructions. I think it's best if an adult sets it up for kids to crank. I've used it twice and have had good results. A couple of points: You don't have to pack the ice real tight- if you do, you may have trouble; I tried using red-cherry cola, and it turned the white auger pink. The parts are not diswasher-safe. My wife and my daughter both say it makes drinks that are better than the slushees sold by a big chain of drive-ins. I wouldn't say the toy has any educational value, but it I was satisfied that it does a good job of making slushees."
1,not durable at ALL,"I got this toy for my child on his birthday. He loved it at first and thought it would be great. It says that using full-size ice cubes is okay, so we took some from the freezer and put them in. We tried to use it but the yellow mixer broke before we could do anything. An additional note is that it is hard to put together."
3,Solution for the problems,After trying to make this work for a while I came across all these posts and thought there must be a way. I had tried turning for a long time and never got it to freeze at all. So I tried using rock salt instead of table salt. I just covered the bottom of the container with rock salt and filled it up with crushed ice. Just a little bit of water. Then it worked perfect. The liquid turned slushy in 2 minutes.
1,"Turn, turn, turn = same drink you put in","My 5 year old boy save his money for 3 months to purchase this. He bought it and came home with such excitement and enthusiasm. We set it up and began turning the handle. We turned and turned for 45 minutes. Nothing happened. We cleaned it out and tried another liquid, nothing happened. After an evening of turning, we drank the same liquid that we put into the machine. The next day we returned it to the store and found the Rival automatic plug in snow cone maker. It is in the kitchen appliance area. It works wonders in just seconds and we all enjoyed a delicious snow cone.After reading some good reviews on this, we made the purchase. Now we believe that those bad reviews were correct (...) It has tons of parts and pieces to clean and get lost. Overall, don't even try this model."
1,I got this toy more than a year ago,This toy dose not work and the frozen treat is semi frozen when done. It's like puting a pop bottel in the freezer and leting it sit ther for a bit and you will get a better slushy from that then u would ever get from that maschine. I say do not wast your money on this toy its a piece of junk. I even gave it away i hated it so much.
1,Disappointed,"My daughter received this for Christmas. We followed all of the directions..to the letter. We did this 4 different times with 4 different drinks. IT DIDN'T WORK any of the 4 times. My husband tried it the first time it didn't work. I assumed he must be doing something wrong, so I tried it next. Then we both tried it again at separate times. We used non-diet drinks(as stated), both soda and fruit juice, none of the attempts produced an icee, not even a bit of slush.Our children only get 3 items from Santa(we want to cut down on commercialism, plus Jesus only got 3 right?...the wise men) Anyway, this was one of her 3 items. Imagine how disappointed she was when 1 of her 3 items didn't even work! This is by far the most disappointing toy we have ever purchased."
1,Too much work,"We used this item one time, and that was on Christmas day when my 8-year-old received this. What a waste of money. Remember how you complain every year you won't get your kids those kinds of worthless toys they use once then toss away? This would be one of those toys. It's messy, hard to use, and you get about a tablespoon of slushee in the end."
1,Slushee is a bust,"We gave this machine to our 6 year old for Chanukah. After the entire family spent over 1 hour trying to put it together, it did nothing but leak juice and water all over the kitchen floor. Besides, who in their right mind would spend 4 minutes cranking ice when we already have blenders? This toy is a useless piece of plastic. Do not waste your money on it!"
1,not good at all,"This toy has no instructions what so ever to put it together. And, then the crushed ice turns into liquid before you can get together. It also is very messy, three adults cranked it and it went flying all over my kitchen floor. I wouldn't recommend this toy for people who don't like fun stuff."
1,AWFUL,"We bought this toy for our son. it is an awful waste of money. After putting the thing together, it never makes the icee.... We followed the directions to the T. it never worked.... what a waste!"
1,Dont buy it,If your are thinking about buying this toy i recomend not too. THis is a pointless thing. It doesnt even make very good slushies. The only thing it does is make cold soda which you could just use ice. You also have to be very very careful to make sure none of the middle mixture doesnt get in the pop cause if it does the slushies or i should say pop taste like a disgusting salty drink. If your think about buying this i advise you not too.
4,Fun to use,"I purchased with slushee maker a couple of years ago for the kids. Although it it a little messy and of cheap quality, it works. It's fun to help and watch the kids make their own slushees. All in All it is a good products, but don't expect Slurpee style drinks with this."
1,Poor Design Ruins It,"Note to Spinmaster: You need more than a 1/8"" deep octagonal hole, or the weak plastic part that is supposed to fit into this shallow depression will quickly fail to fit properly, leading to rounded corners and an icee machine that will never work correctly.This piece of junk is design to work about once, maybe."
1,Use your blender,"One star for fun since ""zero"" was not an option. One star for educational value since my 9 year old learned what the definition of ""misrepresentation"" is - she is now wary of the garbage quotient found within certain products. On a positive note, my deltoids and forearms got a bit of a handle rotation workout for 15 minutes before I gave up. Based on the reviews of most of their products compared to the claims in their instructions and advertising, I find their name (SpinMaster) quite appropriate. Save the money, time, and aggravation - return to your blender. Kids like buttons anyway and they can learn ""grate"", ""blend"", ""chop"", etc...."
3,How does this crush ice?,"VERY cool idea, but...how does it work? I just bought it today and there is NO way this thing can crush the ice with its plastic blades...If you know how to fix this or how this thing works...do you mind letting me know? Thanks!..."
2,Disappointment!!!,"My son begged and begged for this. Finally I gave in and got it for his birthday. We put it together and gave it a whirl. The handle kept falling off. It took forever to get slush, and when you were finally finished, it didn't produce enough to satisy a 2 year old let alone my 7 year old son. You would have to spend three hours cranking away to give 3 people a taste."
1,Horrible!,"I have never purchased such a bad product! Very, very difficult to assemble. I had to asked my mechanical brother-in-law and even he took awhile. And trying to find the right combination of ingredients is difficult. Following the recipe directions does not work. Be prepared to crank and crank and crank. And keep fiddling with the mixture of ingredients. This toy will be thrown out."
1,ABSOLUTE PIECE OF JUNK,"Frankly, I'm surprised ICEE allowed their name to be associated with this cheap product. I'm convinced the ""positive reviews"" for this product were written by employees of the SpinMaster company.This product is made of poorly designed components and the sum of its parts is no better. A COMPLETE PIECE OF JUNK.After following the instructions to the letter, multiple times, I am convinced this product only ""wastes your time and irritates the juice"".IN SHORT DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY CONSIDERING THIS PRODUCT. Please, just get a blender and add some juice - you'll end up with at least some slush and you won't get discouraged and disheartened simply trying to have a good time with your family.SHAME ON THIS PATHETIC PIECE OF GARBAGE."
1,disappointed child,"I didnt get a chance to see if this icee maker was worth the money, because when my son opened the box on christmas morning there were no directions to the machine at all, it sits on my dryer as a dust collerctor, but reading other reviews it sounds like the perfect lint collector."
1,Slushee Maker Sucks!!,"I got this from my aunt a few years ago. Me and my cousins were so excited to make ourselves some slushees, so we decided to make some in my kitchen. We added all of the ingredients, but when it was done, all we got was gross, salty, orange soda. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF CRAP!!"
3,"Well, it does actually work","It works, but the 4-6 minutes you need to stir it can tire you out... It's fun for the kids to get a slushee, not so much fun as an adult to make them :) It is neat, but here are two things I would recommend to SpinMaster:1 - needs to be bigger, only makes 2 tiny cups at one time2 - offer a motorized attachment :)3 - call the auger ""the spinny thing"" - I didn't know what an auger was :)3 stars for fun - fun for the kids but too much work for little results3 stars for educational - really, its not education but you do do a little chemistry to get the slushee frozen4 stars for durability - after cranking this (...) all the time, it stays together."
1,Nothing but a pain,"We tried for 30 minutes. we cranked and cranked - taking turns. After many jokes, all we got was really cold stuff, sore arms, and a disapponted child. Thank goodness we only bought it at a garage sale. Now I know why they sold it for 50 cents. That was really over-priced!"
1,I hate it.,I wanted it to work and it didn't. My Mom kept trying and she called someone to help her from the company. She told me they said it must be broke. We bought it yesterday. It never worked.
1,Worst Experience I've had on Christmas Day,"My 5 year old son, like many others, was begging for this slushee maker. A relative bought it for him for Christmas and of course my son wants to make some right away. I was almost in tears, I got so frustrated trying to put it together and get it to work right. Then my son gets upset because he's been waiting for this day for months. I ended up putting it all back in the box and returning it for a refund. There are too many fun things out there to get your kids. Please don't waste your money on this one.......nothing but heartaches!!! In my opinion ONE STAR was too high for this thing!"
1,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!! A waste of time and energy!,"My husband and I decided not to buy this item for our 5 year old daughter because we thought it was a waste of money. Unfortunately, her aunt didn't think so and bought it for her anyway. The first time we used it, we had no problem whatsoever. It was easy to put together and we ended up with 2 small cups of slush. At that point, my husband and I thought not a bad toy. We could have fun when the neices and nephews come over. WRONG!!!! The next time we tried to make an icee we had 4 very disappointed kids waiting for an icee. While turning the crank, the liquid froze the auger to the metal canister. This in turn left plastic shavings inside the liquid because we kept trying to crank the thing. After 5 more attempts (using less salt, less ice, crushed ice, not crushed ice, chilled the liquid, etc.) we gave up and put the darn thing away. The only good thing that came out of this, is that it wasn't our money that was wasted on it. Thanks Aunt Kate!!!"
1,One of the worst things I've ever bought,We bought this as a birthday present to my six year old. Thought it looked like great summer fun. It really wasn't hard to put together but we couldn't get the silly thing to work. It started out fine until the bottom froze so that we couldn't crank anymore and ended up with a tiny bit of frozen icee and mostly cold drink. We followed the directions exactly and this happened both times we tried it out. Back to the store it goes!
2,Spend the extra $10 and buy a manual ice cream maker,"This is just a small version of an 1800s ice cream maker including dangerously cold metal parts. Modern manual ice cream makers sell for around $30 and they do not have this problem. All of the complaints of this product do not exist with a regular ice cream maker. Furthermore, you can actually make ice cream with an ice cream maker, as well as slushies. I brought this for myself (pregnant woman with food allergies), but after reading the instructions I do not even feel comfortable using this ""toy"". As for the education value of salt water, you can accomplish that with a glass of ice water and salt."
1,Waste of money,"My son had to earn this toy as a reward. What a disappointment! He was crushed when the icee machine didn't work at all. We cranked and cranked for 3 times the instructed amount and nothing. We cleaned the machine and tried again the next night with Dad reading the instructions. No luck. We returned this toy back to the store, but the kids were heartbroken that their reward was a bust!"
1,Kids Disappointed,This just did not work for us at all. We had 4 boys sitting around it very excited to get an icee - but it didn't work after cranking it for more than 15 minutes. Don't waste your money. We took it back the next day.
1,Waste of Money,This product is terrible. Called the company three times and they gave me varying ideas to make this work but to no avail. This product is not worth a penny.
3,sandblaster,"I guess since I didn't pay much for it I shouldn't expect much. You have to hold the tip less than 2"" from what you are working with. You need to shake canister often so material will come out after level is down to 1/4. I tried using sand but it didn't work and had to use black beauty for the job."
2,Could not take paint/rust off steel,I could not take paint/rust off steel with this unit with silica sand. Might work okay for light paint on wood.
1,Big mistake,"Don't buy a siphon type sand blaster,especially this one! Cheap is cheap...this one is as cheap as they come. Used it for about an hour and it was a pain to use. I should have known better. I was using fine grit black beauty blast media,and my compressor was more than big enough. I was using a 10HP 240V 3-phase 150 gallon compressor running 125psi. So air pressure wasn't the issue. It's just a cheap unit. I'm sorry I ever bought this product. I did my research and purchased a pressurized sand blast unit. I'm not doing anything heavy, just removing paint on a 73 VW and just wanted something to work. I got sucked in by the reviews and spent money I didn't need to. Do your homework! Siphon type systems just don't perform like a pressurized unit. I hope this review keeps someone from buying this piece of crap."
2,plugs up too much,"I am getting the job done, but I am also having problems keeping the sand blowing. I am using Black Diamond, but it keeps plugging up. I have a good compressor, but I still have to stop and let it rest now and then."
1,did not work at all,connectected it per the instructions and no sand would come out a complete waste I do not recommend this to anyone
2,Mediocre at best,"The plot - girl gives up her virginity to save a family member - is a bit old hat and the couple does too many improbable things...what are the odds of her getting captured by Indians and then rescued by her ""john""??? Furthermore, the author really didn't try to give an accurate depiction of Numu (Comanche) culture at all. Indian romances of this caliber are simply exploitive. I was disappointed."
4,"Builds slowly, but keep going...","This book.....wow. I am so close to giving it 5 stars. I have rarely been so compelled to read on, to see these characters through one of the most harrowing, unimaginable experiences I've ever encountered in fiction. While I was in the final chapters, where things really ""heat up"" (as much as things can ""heat up"" in the Arctic Circle), I was trembling, really trembling, with tension from the suspense, drama, danger, and fear I felt on behalf of these characters. They're ""real people"" in that they're pretty well fleshed out, believable, relatable--especially Beryl (the protagonist) and David (a companion photographer on the same expedition). Short book, page-turner in some places (especially at the end, as I've mentioned), nicely thoughtful but still well-paced character study in other places. Schulman is one of the masters of matching physicality to character, of making this reader, at least, truly feel present in her characters' lives."
2,Not very compelling...,"Too bad this book wasn't about the cage(thus the title), but was instead about the main character. She wasn't compelling enough to hold my attention for long. I longed for more close encounters with the polar bears, instead the book focused too much on the disunity of the crew. I expected more from this book."
2,Beginning was Lame Middle was Cool and Ending was horrible!,"Well, first off the first 80pages were useless, just a short bio of the main character Beryl and little events describing what she would be doing. After that, the next 50pages was basicly a character analysis which was mildly interesting at best. The next 40 pages were mildly interesting, describing the bears what they were like, which helped with the following pages, but was still not that interesting. The last 30-40pages were actually really good, and I was hooked for those 30-40pages. Until the ending! To say the least it was one of the worst endings I have ever read, it was a horrible ending. None of the problems were ever really solved, you don't even know if one of the characters even lived, and you never even know how things worked out in the end for the character(s), too many things were left untold to make it even close to a solid ending. I hope nobody ever reads this book, it's too big of a let down to justify reading it."
4,A Surprisingly Good Little Novel,"This book sat in my room for months, given to me by my Aunt and continually passed over, until, desperate for something to read I picked it up. I wish I had months earlier. It was WONDERFUL; sparse and yet captivating."
4,My 6 year old nephew loves it,Its a good toy and very cute but very small it would almost be better for a toddler then child. My nephew is smaller then other kids his age so its very easy for him to hold and play with. He also loves him a great gift for a small child or toddler who loves Clifford.
5,FUN,"A fun collection of great Latin music, featuring performances (mostly from the 1990's) by Julio Iglesias & Placido Domingo, Gypsy Kings, Banda Blanca, Ruben Blades, Texas Tornados, Juan Luis Guerra, Luis Miguel, Xuxu and Magneto. DVD released in 2002 by Cascadia Labs, color, runs 45 minutes. **Note** this DVD is in the original Spanish language only. There are no subtitles or English lyrics."
4,An evocative look at childhood's insecurites,"As a 50 year-old, I don't usually read books for people in this age bracket, but since I bought ""The Gypsies Never Came"" for the 12-year old daughter of a friend I thought I'd better look through it before I gave it to the girl. I read the first few pages and sat in my chair for the next hour-and-a-half, following Augie through a certain spring when he came to grips with so much of his life. Mr. Roos has an ability to summon the psyche of a child with such accuracy that I was often stunned to recall having felt the same way Augie feels. I heartily recommend this book to anyone looking for something that is entertaining and THEN thought provoking."
4,Gritty and wonderful,"Reminiscent of Wringer and Holes (two recent Newbery Awards) this one has a nice ending that would make it a good readaloud in Middle School where fitting in and being just the same as everybody else is of paramount importance. The two main characters are finely drawn, funny and engaging, kids will find them a bit mythic (good) as well. If you've read Jerry Spinelli's STARGIRL, this one will link to it nicely. It's about entelechy, that fine art of knowing what you'll grow up into--how an acorn knows to grow into an oak tree and not a petunia. It's about compassion, courage, friendship and eccentricity and (gasp) nobody gets tattoed, pierced, drunk, drugged or even in trouble! Yikes, what is the world coming to?"
2,It didn't work for me...,but I teach 9th graders and I'm not its intended audience. This too spare book I found ultimately uninvolving. Augie's troubles left me flat. Lydie Rose would have been the main character in a high school book and the hinted at fantasy would have been more blatant.
3,"okay, not great","For now the product looks great. I saw one recently that looks like it has been in use for a few years and the mailbox support is sagging, so in time I guess mine will too.The initial install over the 4x4 was fine, but the mailbox installation took some time. I am still unclear on how putting soil in the flower box will work, due to a big drainage hole for the water. I think you need to put some type of plastic box within the flower box itself."
2,Living in the Runaway Mountain Time Zone.,"Yes, ""Living in the Runaway Mountain Time Zone"" would be a much better suited title for this book. Apparently the editors of HCN were playing hooky when U.S. geography was being taught in their rural schools. The last time I checked ""those wine drinking, cheese-eating"" Californians watched the sun sink into the Pacific Ocean long after the rest of the country. But as a large part of the West, both geographically and politically, California is a no-show in the ""Runaway West.""Otherwise, if you can fight through the tired sterotypes that are littered throughout most of the writings, then you might be rewarded."
3,Artwear:Fashion and Antifashion,I love the book but unfortunately the minute I opened it the cover detached from the spine of the book. I am not happy about that.
3,Ok,Good value for this item...would purchase again if needed at a later date..would recommend to others to purchase also..thanks for product!
4,Good Replacement,My old one would not hold charge and needed a new one. This one works good and fits pretty well.
2,Update below! (2 stars for good packaging and prompt replacement),"Did what it does! Works great, last long and worth the price! no complaints here!"
3,math,Its a math text book. It isn't exciting or interesting. Its exactly that you'd expect it to be. I bought it because a class I took was using it. I haven't looked at it since I took the class.
3,Nice book; in great condition!,"Book was in great condition, almost looked new. It arrived in a timely fashion. The student helps are nice. Thank you for your business!"
4,Good As New,Everything the seller wrote about the product was true...book is good as new....the disks that give extra help had no scratches on them. Very happy with the product...
1,still waiting for my product,I have E-mailed the seller twice and still havent recieved the book and would appreciate my money back.
2,Bad condition,"Even though I received this textbook quite fast (within a week), the book condition is quite poor. Some of the pages sticks to each other. The cover is bent. Found a page with profanity written with pen."
4,Mallory in action,This set was the only way I could get Mission Bloody Mary. It is a fine collection of movies. All are fun and two I have already reviewed.Mission Bloody Mary is a fun and exciting movie full of great action and standard sixties spy movie hijinks. Ken Clark makes for a likeable hero who manages to thwart the villan and of course get the girl. These are some of the many Eurospy films that came out in competion with the Bond movies. These three movies are some of the best made at that time and are worth a viewing. I recommend this set for those into sixties spy or Dick Mallory fans.
4,my favorite juicer,wow I wish I could find this juicer again-Juice Master Deluxe Juice Extractor model # Jm2500 I had 3 juicers- this one was my favoite I miss it- so easy to use and clean! Let me know where i can find one !!
5,Awesome,"I'm getting ready for Army Basic Training, so obviously I'm doing a ton of cardio to prepare. I was already in shape before buying this, but after I started using this I have noticed a considerable difference in my lung capacity and how hard I'm breathing. I go hike a TOUGH mountain trail near my house at least twice a week and I can definitely notice a difference in how much less effort I'm putting in to breathing, as well as my legs even burning - which I think is due to my body oxygenating so much better. Definitely recommend it if you play any type of sports, you're military/future military, or you just enjoy staying fit."
5,Great lung capacity training for brass instrumentalists!,"This product was recommended by a marching band brass ""tech"". It is increasing my lung capacity to be able to play longer, louder, and while performing the very physically challenging marching band drill."
2,Worked well while new...,"The Ultra product worked as well as my APC power supplies while new. I purchased three of these units and after two years they are no longer providing battery backup services. Seem to work fine to smooth spikes. Perhaps my expectations are too high, but I have three other APC units that are older and still run their systems long enough for an orderly shut down."
5,Stopped that surge,"Recently had the largest surge I have every seen. Three in a row where the lights went really bright. Really wild. Fire alarms and trucks shortly afterward and all. Happened so fast that by the time I came to my senses it was all over. The unit made buzzing rattles during the event, but the computer is still A-Ok. Paid for itself three times over."
1,Boat Anchor,Received this unit intact yesterday. Plugged in and setup unit to run. Shut down with no warning. Called tech support and they told me I had to charge for 6 hours which is not mentioned in the manual. Tried charging and it won't hold a charge.I should have known better after I received first unit delivered all smashed. This one won't hold a charge. There tech support was not helpful as they did not try to walk me through anything. Last tech determined the unit was no good after my few second explanation of the problem (guess this happens often) and that I would have to send back at my cost.Stay away from Ultra products... pure junk!
4,Great CD,"I love the work Chiasm is doing. It is kind of clubby, but with darker undertones. I had never heard of them prior to playing Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines, and have been interested ever since."
5,Love It,"On my wish list is to see them in concert in 2013. Each time they were in my area in 2012, the concert was sold it immediately."
4,NFL Greatest Follies - Volume 2,"This also was a Christmas present for the same grandson and he really liked the video, he is a great football fan."
5,Impossibly good!,"I'm a fan of early Savatage so I just had to get this album. The one thing that always bugged me about Savatage is that after some really good songs, their albums would always have at least 3 bad songs, usually those stupid hard rock ballads. Well, there is none of that here. This is pure heavy thrash metal from beginning to end! Every song is good! The lyrics are very amusing as well. Fans of early Savatage, Metallica, and even Slayer will love this CD!!"
4,A useful book for embedded systems diagnostics,"The book covers the fundamentals of hardware diagnostics, and is still quite usefull for the countless embedded systems that have more limited embedded processors that are often only able to run ""C"" or a subset of ""C"". Concepts for testing serial devices, ram, rom, and disks, are all presented.Don't expect to be able to copy the example code in the book verbatim.The reader will have to develop their own code for testing items like flash memory, and eeprom memory, as well as testing common buses like I2C bus, and SPI bus.Nice to have would be better code for ethernet diagnostics."
2,"Very basic, beginner level info","The info provided in this book is strictly for beginners to the world of diagnostic coding. The data is very out-of-date and applies mostly to basic computer systems of the 70's. The coding styles are also very elementary and is written in the style of an introductory level course in programming. The examples will have very limited use in any contemporary software development effort. The author apparently does not have a solid grasp of C or with code re-use.If you want current and in-depth info about contemporary computer systems and diagnostics - look elsewhere. If you don't know anything at all about computer diagnostics, this book might be able to get you started. I would recommend that you buy it used, however, and save yourself some dough. The cover price is rather expensive for the limited use it will have."
4,This is a good book about Liverpool life just after the war years.,I was introduced ot Joan Jonker by my neighbour and have read several of her books. She goes into graet depth about the day to day lives of people in Liverpool and how friends and neighbours rally round to help each other in times of trouble. This is the second book in a series of three and I enjoyed all of the series.
3,Starting to wear a bit thin,"While this show is still enjoyable some of the characters mannerisms are becomeing a little annoying...Jane is a high power lawyer(albeit with a model trapped in her body) but walks around like she is Betty Boop. BFF Stacey's smile gets to be a bit much after a while , it stretches from the eastern to western seaboard, and she needs to tone it down a bit.Jane get over your old boyfriend...he obviously likes blond bimbo's...move on...its getting boring...and for goodness sake change the intro...after three seasons we get that Jane was once Deb, an aspiring model, and it makes you reach for the remote to fast forward....If this has been cancelled I would imagine it is because it simply started to run out of steam and repeat itself or the viewers got toothache from all the sweetness being spewed over them every week"
1,Stupid Chic show,"OK, who cares about a fat, ugly chic that used to be a ""model"" (you can read that as whore) who is now a lawyer? Not me. This is a total chick show. Avoid at all cost! I don't like lawyers and could care less about fat chicks in open toed shoes. Make a choice: change the chanel or puke."
5,one of the best episodes!,"this episode was one of the best episodes of this series! but don't skip to it because you must know what happened before in order to love this episode.In general, this is a great show! I recommend it."
5,PopOut Map,I love this little popout map of Philadelphia. It fits in my pocketbook and is easy to follow when visiting Philadelphia. I am a photographer and it certainly has come in handy for me to find great locations to photograph.
5,Bob Hope Caught in The Draft/Give Me a Sailor,"These movies present Bob Hope in his usual comical senario....Good entertainment & clean, unlike many of the trash movies we see today ......Alan"
2,Great first song; otherwise disappointing,"The first track of this album, ""Jarhand"", was an iTunes free download, and it is everything you could possibly want in an indie pop song: great, infectious melody, terrific arrangement, nice harmonies, upbeat, and lots of hooks.Sadly, for me, none of the other tracks are at all engaging. Somehow the songs remind me of the opera, ""The Cunning Vixen"", in which the words seem to be spoken more than sung and ultimately is a bit of a bore.On the plus side, I think the cover art is terrific."
2,Higher expecttations,This cd is not as good as the cd they put out before this one. Had higher expectations.
2,Rides - Second Season,"There are some good images of the cars etc. but overall the narrator uses a monotone presentation and gives all the episodes a very boring overall feel. I would appreciate much more coverage of the ""Rides"" and way less or no coverage of the ""Bling masters`that dominate most episodes."
1,Product Not Usable & Sellers don't seem willing to accept a return,"I've sent emails explaining that the product wasn't usable. It wouldn't play on either of my two computers. I've asked unsuccessfully for a return. Bad business, I say.Victoria McCready"
1,boring book,"If you have read this book, you will agree with me: waste time!!!! I doubt the author even doesn't understand Habermas....and also several obivous solecism in this book......."
1,The most confusing book in the world,"I never read such a confusing book since I was born. You will never know what the editors think about. The editors just copy and paste some unrational essays into this mosaic book. Yes, to the editors, it is really a good business for the editors to get some extra money regardless of their dignity. sure, they are chasing money and titles, forever"
5,Handy book for players of all skill levels,"I've only been playing Go for a short time, but this was one of the first books I bought, and I'm very pleased with it. It's nice to pick it up and casually read some of the proverbs. Even if I'm not yet skilled enough to fully make use of all the strategies and tactics outlined in the book, just the general concepts I take away from reading it are invaluable. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to learn more about the ins and outs of Go."
4,Another great story from Linda Daly,Part of the continuing saga from the late 1800's... a troubling time in US history. Enjoyed the love and friendship shared within the family and great plot woven in.
3,Surprisingly Good,"This movie was much, much better than I expected. My only problem was that most of the action took place in the dark and I had to figure out what was happening. Either their should have been a light source or the action should have taken place at dusk or dawn. The story itself , as well as the writing was good. We did not get to see most of the actual killing, which is not necessarily a bad thing. The ending was totally surprising as to who the killer actually was, so the added mystery made for a better picture. The characters themselves were well acted, which is not the case in most of the low budget slasher flicks I have seen. There is an actual story in this movie, along with the usual cliche's like the oversexed couple, but the movie is not over sexed or have an over abundance of the body-count. The slasher flick is actually more than a slasher flick. It actually had a story. If only it had more lights."
2,false info,"this cd is very interesting and all, but some of it is not true! for instance, on this cd the the narrorator talks about the all the small things music video. she say that the video feature tom running on the beach in a bikini with a dog running along his side and the dog grabs a hold of toms leg and plows him to the ground. what i saw on the music video: tom in a tank top holding a beach ball right next to the water not running just standing there, MARK was running in a tee TEE SHIRT AND LONG PANTS and the dog grabbed a hold of HIM, not tom, and plowed HIM to the ground! so i would not buy this if you want the real truth. if you do want the real truth, buy tales from beneath your mom, actualy written by blink 182."
1,Bad,"This was a terriable cd, the information on this cd controdicted with the information in blinks book. Blink-182:Tales from beneath your mom. it was not properly researched and the narrators voice was annoying and hard to understand. She also said that they were blink 1-8-2 and it is blink 182(1 eighty 2). And that is my rational for my review"
3,"Awsome poster, but very small","After seeing this poster online thur Amazon, I was tryingt to find the same in a bigger size, but I couldnt find one, so I went this one becasue I love this show and I love this image. It would be great if images like this would come in a bigger size or even if a movie poster size."
5,I have to buy it on Amazon I love it so much!,"I was buying this chai from World Market, but they stopped selling it! I have tried so many other brands and varieties, and nothing comes close to this delicious mix. So, Here I am on Amazon buying it because this is the only place I can find it. I am getting the 4lb bag because it will not go to waste. All of my friends who have tried it love it. My coworkers who sit near me just smell the open canister and comment on how delicious it smells, so I have to buy some for them too so they don't drink all of my chai! If you are in doubt, buy this one, you will love it! If you don't love it, send it to me :-)"
5,This chai is delicious!,"I'm not even a big-time chai drinker, but this Tiger Spice chai is turning me off coffee. Just first-rate deliciousness. One sip and you'll be hooked."
3,Must be used with Applied Cryptography,"As one other reader pointed out this book can be called Applied Cryptography Light. It is true, it gives you more theory and very little math. I did not like this book by itself since I was interested in actual implementation and i wanted to see full algorithms and math. I did end up buying Applied Cryptography and those 2 books combined provide an excellent reference. I was not able to give more than 3 stars since I did not feel i got any knowledge out of this book to be able to apply it in real life except reading: ""Cryptography is hard, you might need to hire an expert..."" while I want to become an expert myself one day!"
4,this is applied crypro lite,"If you liked Applied Cryptography, but were turned off by all the math, get this book.It is Applied Cryptography Light.Not that this is such an easy read, but a much easier, updated and practical read than Applied Cryptography."
3,Biased to Schneier's algorithms,"This can be an annoying book for a serious developer, but I do know Writing a secure cryptosystem is very hard. People should be aware that it is hard, and they are likely to make mistakes. It isn't something that should be attempted lightly. If you are doing some actual work, it's not a good one. The book does not cover sufficient mathematic knowledge, and the edit is bit horrible as well. The authors chose to support their own algorithm shedding less light on AES and even RSA. That really made me stop reading this book.The author's other book ""Applied Cryptography"" is still my favorite."
5,One of the very best Awdry titles,"Gordon grows up in this very well written book and gets to meet his twin, the LNER's famous ""Flying Scotsman"". Henry is jealous of FS's two tenders, and this earns him a comeuppance. However, he redeems himself in the next story by a ""Super Rescue"" of two of the dreaded diesels. Finally, Douglas rescues a Great Western tank engine from scrap."
2,Sturdy but smelly,"I bought this item for transporting around 100-lb load. It works very well. However, the rubber on the two wheels emits strong pungent chemicals that give me serious headaches. I have to store it on my balcony and keep spraying Clorox. After weeks the smell was subdued a little bit. Buyers beware if you have little kids, animal, or sensitive house members."
2,Not very sturdy,"Within a few weeks of relatively light use, the nuts started to fall out. I replaced them all at my local hardware store for a couple of bucks. That did the trick, but the fact that it happened at all shows that Safco doesn't really care about making quality products.But then, after about a year, the aluminum actually started to bend and even tear. I've never lifted more than 125lbs with this thing at once (half of what it's supposedly rated for)! It's mostly sitting in a closet when I don't need to travel.I definitely can't recommend this hand truck for anyone who needs to move around more than 50lbs at a time, maybe, and I will be steering clear of Safco in the future."
1,DANGEROUS ODOR,SAFECO 4061 HAND TRUCK IS BAD! I FIND THE WHEELS TOXIC! TOXIC! DO NOT BUY AS THE ODOR WILL MAKE YOU SICK IF USED IN CONFINED SPACE OR TRANSPORTED IN SUV OR STATION WAGON! I CALLED SAFECO AND THEY WOULD NOT HELP WITH WHEELS THAT DO NOT HAVE THIS ODOR.
3,Improve your writing,"This Book was a Little more advanced than I needed.i would recommend ""The Best Little grammar book ever"" Or ""Business Grammar Style Usage"" Before you use the Improve your writing book. Over all they are very informative and good books. This one is just for moreadvanced users in my opinon. This is the 5th addition ,so maybe the first few are less advanced."
3,English Mysteries,"I love Midsomer Murders, Miss Marple, Rosemary & Thyme... so I ordered this one. It's very slow moving. My husband and I have tried to watch a few times, fell asleep every time."
5,A Funny Change of Scenery,We watched this series many years ago and it was enjoyable to see them again. Especially the behind the scenes information from the actors and director. We missed the great commentary from Alistair Cook introducing each episode. M. Hanner
5,memories of living in england,This is a great dvd set--remember seeing it years ago on channel 9--dry humor but very entertaining-set arrived as described and very punctually
3,Interesting read,"Got this book for free on my kindle. It's a how-to guide and is actually, pretty funny, as the author likes to call just about everything he disagrees with ""stupid."" There are no illustrations, so keep that in mind. This book is really more for getting my anachronistic jollies than for anything truly useful (as I said, there are no illustrations in this edition)."
2,Not worth the purchase price with just one episode,"I think I may have been spoiled by the 'Slayers' collections of the television series. I'm used to *at least* two half-hour episodes per tape and with the first few 'Slayers Try' tapes we got *four* at a time.The animation in 'Explosion Array' is top-notch, the voice acting and score are at their usual high standards (in the subtitled edition which is what I have), and the storyline features the typical mix of 'Slayers' drama and humour. I just feel that I didn't get enough value for my money.(Yes, there IS a portfolio of production sketches at the end of the tape, but it's too little.)"
3,badbones,"both shows very funny, but the master had some minor flaws. movies above average with plenty of laughs. like it when you get two titles for the price of one."
5,Looks even better in person!,"I ordcered this to give as a gift. It looks great and will look perfect next to the wood stove. I didn't realize that it came with fatwood, so that was a plus! Arrived in great condition and very quickly too."
2,"Check shipping, not per policy","I didn't actually get the mask, because it tried to sneak in a 19.95 shipping charge in my cart. Plenty of other vendors out there, but beware..."
5,TRINITY GOODHEART,"This was a must see family movie. It is so moving and speaks on interracial relationship and how the families react to them. It's about love that despite the odds they still loved each other enough to have a beautiful baby girl. it will make you laugh and cry, it brings a broken family back together. Just a great movie for all to see."
4,Eric Benet Shines!,"My family and I watched this together. We have a 15 year old and an 8 year old. We all loved the movie; especially the girls. My husband and I were blown away by Eric Benet's natural talent on screen (we're already big fans of his music). We both thought that most of the movie budget must have been spent on Eric Benet and James Hong as the rest of the actor's (outside of an impressive Erica Gluck)performances were sub-par. At any rate, we loved the movie. The girls have already watched it for a second time."
4,Nice family movie,"Got this movie for my 9 year old daughter, but although she did like it, she was a little bored in parts. I wish they would have kept more of the Spirituality in it like the play. It was a nice movie for the family but I think my husband and I enjoyed it just a little more than our daughter. The young girl is a wonderful actress! All this said...my daughter did watch it a second time a couple days later so it must have caught her interest!"
2,dougv,"The plot is slow moving and often boring.The acting is not great, especially the young girl, who is the heroine.The ending is happy, with relationships resolved, but the rest of the film didn't hold my attention.I don't recommend buying this film."
5,Works for very early detection,I can't believe that 1 week post conception this test picks up being pregnant. I highly recommend this brand! I used in conjunction with ovulation test.
2,Go digital,"We got a dark line and a very faint line and had no idea what that meant. So we bought a digital test and it told us that we were pregnant without any confusion! Wish we could have saved the time, money, and nerves by just starting with the digital test."
5,Tugging along,"If I win the lottery I want to buy a tugboat. Until then, this video and a book or two will have to suffice. Affordable even if they can't save the euro."
5,ADDICTED,BEST BAND I HAVE EVER LISTENED TO. REAL FUNK AND SOUL FROM GIFTED MUSICIANS. A MUST HAVE TO EVERY SOUL FAN.
4,A useful text book for the course,"I've used the book for the Hist of Econ Thought course I teach, and it has proved very useful. The authors explore the historical context as well as the theories of the economists in a clear and easily accessibly manner. The only critique I have is their apparent sympathy to a school of thought I disagree with, but that does not detract from the overview they provide."
4,Computer Networking and the Internet (5th Edition) by Fred Halsall from greid23,"This book was purchased from greid2 in very good condition. Response and proof was quickly received from the seller. Seems my postman did not leave a package/delivery slip in my apartment's mailbox 3 weeks ago..Anyways, my coworker allowed me to skim through this course book from one of his classes; seems the author was also his professor. I liked the material, grammar, and details enough to purchase one for myself.Hopefully, I do not forget to write an update when I finish the book next year. ;-)"
2,Not needed,I had this on my camera and ripped it off just after 2wks of usage. The protector eventually comes off at the edges if you have your camera in a tight fitting case - the edges snag-off when I pull my camera out of the case. The camera screen is made of glass/quartz and is resistant to scratches so you don't need this product to protect from scratches. Don't waste your money.
5,Shipped rapidly... went on easily.,"Seems to be a quality product... but if it breaks soon, I will come back and tell you."
5,A dazzling compilation that takes the reader on a dizzying journey through fractured time and space,"Each of Nebula, Hugo, Tiptree, International Horror Guild, and World Fantasy Award finalist Gregory Frost's outstanding tales of fantasy is enhanced by the illustrations of Jason Van Hollander in Attack Of The Jazz Giants And Other Stories, a compendium of imaginative and entertaining short stories. Readers are treated to stories of an apocalyptic being that hides in a Ukrainian village; a horror that dwells in Jack the Ripper's pocket watch; a crossroads in which the Castle of Otranto connects with the Depression Era South, and more. Featuring a foreword by bestselling author Karen Joy Fowler and an afterword to each individual tale by award-winning author John Kessel, Attack Of The Jazz Giants And Other Stories is a dazzling compilation that takes the reader on a dizzying journey through fractured time and space."
5,"compelling, edgy, resonant","Frost has a gift for hooking you by the collar and dragging you into quirky worlds made believable, then turning you to gaze from there back into the accepted world as through a wavery two-way mirror. Thus you find yourself looking with tilted head at the homeless, or the use of religion to exploit workers, or the over-worked, ever-dissolving family, and perhaps, finally, seeing them in ways that resonate in the day-to-day. His stories are odd, quirky, angry and amusing. And they echo. Well worth the read."
4,"Not perfect, but not bad","For reference, I got the paperback with the new afterward (a 1998 version), which goes up to the heady early days of the Khatemi regime. Mackey's basic thesis is that Iran is torn between dual identites - a highly cultured Persian society and a foreign Islamic society. This is kind of a simplistic way to look at Iran, especially since this thesis has been beaten to death in works on Russia (with Asianism replacing Islam), Turkey, and other states that stand astride different civilizations. The arguement isn't presented terribly forcefully here - it is more of a string used to tie together disperate events in Iranian history. I'm also a little disappointed that the book concentrates so heavily on the recent past given Iran's rich ancient history. However, on the whole this is very readable and was a great book for someone like me who came in knowing relatively little about Iranian history prior to the Islamic revolution."
2,"mostly good facts, bad conclusions","this book is okay for a beginners intro to iran but it misconstrues completely some of the facts of iranian history. mossdaegh did NOT assume dicatatorial powers, and at times it seems that ms mackey feels sympathy for the shah. the crimes of SAVAK, the shah's secret police, arent well documented either. dont waste your money- I recommend THE LAST GREAT REVOLUTION by Robin wright or PERSIAN MIRRORS by Elaine Sciolino"
3,A small message to the authoress,"Ma'am, I am not given to writing book reviews professionally BUT as a practising, born and bred Zoroastrian, I feel compelled to say that our ethical triad rests on Good Thoughts, Good Words and Good Deeds - in that order. Perhaps a typo makes you state Good Works which would equal Good Deeds. Also some not very au fait with Zoroastrianism are often found to place Good Words before Good Thoughts - a slight impossibility, don't you think?For further assistance with the not too obvious, please feel free to write to me privately at my email address - I should love to learn more about you too!Thanks for a patient read,Shirin J. Mistry."
3,"Detailed and interesting, but at times Romanticizes culture","Mackey has written an excellent book in terms of historical facts and detailed accounts of Iran's past. However, her analysis and commentary on Iranian identity leaves much to be desired. She attempts to provide a modern perspective of Iran through discussing its long past, yet it seems to me that Mackey seems bent on forming an all-inclusive idea of what being ""Iranian"" is. That simply is not possible. Given the long history, incredible diversity, and complexity of the subject (which the author notes), the only way that one could present formula of ""Iranianism"" is by making many generalizations, which abound in this book. How else could one fit some 2500 years of history into 400 or so pages? All in all, it is a great introduction to Iran and a well-written, engaging book. My advice to readers: take Mackey's conclusions about why Iranians are the way they are with a grain of salt; this is not an academic book but rather, popular reading."
1,What do you expect from a westerner?,"Sandra Mackey in this book puts together half facts, accusations and fiction together and present them as a work of research. She claims, for instance, that lack of female figures in remains of Persepolis proves that Cysrus invented veil for women and was the orignator of femal subordniation which was later picked up by other cultures. I would not expect anything different from a self-serving, westerner with depp roots in judeo-christianity who would naturally seek to place blame for the backward implements that her heritage was responsible for."
1,Couldn't finish this one....,It's rare that I do not finish a book--particularly a book on Iran since I was once engaged to a lovely Iranian man and visited that country on four different occasions.I was not impressed with this book. I would like to ask the author if she ever lived in Iran and really got to know the people of that beautiful country...I highly recommend: Daughter of Persia
3,Popular - sometimes simplistic and Orientalist,"Not bad as an introduction to Iranian history & culture, though it lacks rigour and contains some glaring errors. It is what you'd expect from a reporter with no formal qualification or background on Iran."
1,Poor scholarly integrity,"This book is very poorly researched. It's more a quick handbook to a dimplomat taking a crash course on Iranian history, as opposed to a neutral scholarly work. For example, the author's portray of Bahais as religious heretics who, ""..called for heads to be cut off"", shows her failure in inquiriing with many sources. The few paragraphs she dedicates to this very significant religious movement in 19th century-the Bahai Faith- are based on accounts by Muslims antagonists to this religion. If someone pursues such a project, they must consult all possible sources and views. Very dissapointing."
2,Well Intended/Poorly Informed,"Though the intention was there the facts failed this work. Early in the book when discussing the literary tradition of Iran she lists famed poets. As an indication of the poor research we notice that she lists Molana and Rumi as seperate poets when in fact they are the same person. A glaring error of that magnitude, considering Rumi is second only to Khayam in his worldly fame as a Persian poet, leads one to doubt the level of accuracy in the overall work!"
1,Misunderstood notions of a complex culture,"At first, this book is great to read. When Mackey is re-iterating ancient history, as anyone can, it's fine. However, her interpretations of Islam, causes for the revolution, and what Iranian people truly feel is misplaced and not accurate. She does not represent popular opinion but merely regurgitates propogandized western surface idealogy and gives the horrible regime credibility. It's almost as if her impressions were taken from the mullahs themselves.For those wishing to gain an insight into Iran, this book will only give you false impressions."
4,Makes clear the causes of today's problems,"Those trying to understand the historical background to the current problems in Iran will find this book a useful introduction. Mackey does an excellent job with recent events, explaining the illegitimacy of the Pahlavi dynasty and the events leading to the Shah's overthrow, providing insights into the fierce and puritancial vision of Ayatollah Khomeini, and recounting the stagnation of the economy, the mismanagement of the war with Iraq, and the country's deepening isolation from the West. Especially interesting to me: the character sketch of Reza Shah, the theme of the country's vulnerability as a pawn in the superpowers' strategic games, and the aborted attempts at reform in 1905 and 1953. I also appreciated learning something about Ali, Hussein, and the historical roots of Shiism.Less compelling parts include the survey of pre-Islamic history (Achaemenian and Sassanian dynasties), which I found less gripping than the narration of recent events."
2,Unsatisfied Reading,"Like many reviewers I have only been able to read 2/3's of the book. I like how she covered the History up to 1900. But beyond that she is not too informative. She has turned Mossadeq into the only politician, and Shaikh Khazal into the only seperatist of the 20th Century. She has no mention of other politicians like Vossough ol Dowleh, Qavam ol Saltana, Mostofi, or Sepahsalar. She doesn't cover the Revolutions in Gilan, Azerbaijan, Kurdistan. Like many authors she doesn't give the Qajar/Kadjar Dynasty any good light. Her book was the first book that I read on Persian History, and since then I have had to read over 5 more to get a real picture of Iran. I recommend Massoume Price's book ""Iran's Diverse Peoples A Reference Sourcebook."""
1,So fascinating yet manic,"This book is filled with an immense amount of historical information in regards to Iran and the country's history. I find Iranian history fascinating on its own. Sandra Mackey has written the most unorganized and poorly structured book I have ever picked up. It jumps around so much that it makes it very difficult for the reader to gain a clear understanding of the history and influential personalities mentioned. If you have to read this for class and a research paper or test is required, I don't see it possible to not spend hours flipping back and forth from the index to marked page. I would find this book incredibly enjoyable if it were better structured. There is no doubt in my mind that she is an expert on middle eastern studies, but the book really does read terribly. Could have been so great. The history of Iran is an amazing story on its own."
4,"Noisy, but cool to watch","Changes colors, nice to watch, but motor kinda noisy. Guess it provides some ""white noise"". Easy to assemble, but requires distilled water."
2,too noisy for the price,"I thought this item was very cool to watch........ if I was deaf or didnt have ears! It is very noisy! It kind of ruins the cool effects of the mesmerizing water swirling around and changing colors. After spending so much on it with the shipping costs I guess I expected more, but the noise forces me to give it only 2 stars...."
4,New Action,"I like this film,a new face in action movies. I can tell it is an indie film but it has a lot of the big film fill. First I can tell it's shot on film... and the lead guy really know's How to fight! The cast is good and so is the action. The Locator good film..."
3,Works most of the time,"Good battery for extended use of your computer, but it's so heavy that it disconnects if you lift the laptop and forget to hold the battery."
2,Black Magic,"This is the same movie as Meeting at Midnight but not as professionally made as the latter. I choose to keep this one because it is adequate enough and less expensive. Right now, bugets are tighter."
3,Black Magic,"Unfortunately, I purchased this movie as a single item not realizing that I already had the DVD as part of a Charlie Chan package I had purchased some time ago. Therefore, I was disappointed because I thought it was a new release. I currently, have all the Charlie Chan releases in my collection."
2,Black Magic w/Charlie Chan,"Sid Toler and Mantan Moreland only saving grace of this pix. I had seen many years ago. Seems like some of movie edited out, and for that PRICE. Lord! For instance, Chan says, initials on woman's purse tell of ""name"" not same as she gave. NOwhere does anyone see a purse, not Chan nor Police. Seems like not real good editing job. If they record or press this when ordered, they need a NEW master, as this barely acceptable. Only Toler/Moreland save the day. Only for my colelction, or would not order at all.Cecy Ivie"
5,Prince: When Doves Cry (Import Single) (1984),"Now, I was never, nor have I ever been a fan of Prince. I never liked his music. The only things I really like about him are his guitar playing, and the fact that he's a great lyricist. I looked at this single and saw that it is the single to ""When Doves Cry"", which is one of his hit singles from the infamouse PURPLE RAIN soundtrack. But that song wasn't what pursuaded me to buy this single. It was the single's flip-side, ""Purple Rain"", the film and soundtrack's infamous title-track, that persuaded me to buy this single.""Purple Rain"" is about the only song I ever really liked from Prince. That, and ""I Would Die 4 U"". ""Purple Rain"" is Prince's most brilliant piece of work. The music to the song is so captivating and so amazingly beautiful, words cannot describe it. ""Purple Rain"" is the reason why I rated this single five-stars. As for ""When Doves Cry"", it is not too bad of a song...musically. But ""Purple Rain"", in my opinion, is the real gem here."
5,Best Comping book available,"As a professor of music at a university in New York, I consider JazzGuitar Comping to be a must have for all my guitar students. Thisbook excels at detailing how to use chord voicings in a musical way(rather than page after page of chord grids that never address how toconnect the chords when actually making music). Starting with simplevoice leading illustrations using basic jazz voicings all the way tocomplex chord construction using both traditional and modernapproaches, this book covers a lot of ground. The section on Rhythms isgreat at outlining many possibilities. I also like the factthat Green doesn't bog you down with too much text. Everything isexplained concisely and then you start playing. Simply the best bookon comping available."
1,Takes long time to read the chords,"I was very excited when i was waiting for this book, but was disappointed w/o any grids. It takes most people along time to figure out the correct fingerings for all these chords. would have helped alot to have some guide.The comping patterns might be good ,but if it takes forever to learn them its not useful. I've moved on to other resourcesk"
3,Its ok,It is an ok story for both films. Neither were all that funny. I did expect more from Bob Hope and Martha Ray.
4,Serves a purpse,"Does what it is intended to do, but is complicated and a little ugly... but very rugged and dependable."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A bit of a change of pace, here. There is a major focus on a character in a town that it turns out is harboring Raven, who is doing some organlegging, and also Darling.Plenty of the usual undead wizard nastiness, as well. There is basically part of the two camps of wizards storyline, as an attempt is made to bring back The Dominator (again). Yet another L v D epic.Needless to say, there is a battle, and why a career in the Company is maybe not that great an idea."
3,Not bad,"This one is better, I think, than ""The Black Company"" because it makes no special pretense to being military fantasy and the action mostly stays in one place. In Marron Shed, Cook has tried and in large measure succeeded in creating a man who does indeed mix good and evil, and who wants to redeem himself. The events are more clearly told than in the previous book, although not so clearly as to let me give this book four stars--not quite. I continue to find it refreshing that Cook's books concentrate on action and events; you will not find here the sort of infuriating word-spinning and pointless description of tunics, statues, and chamber pots that we so often find in the big thick tomes of an author like....well, lets say ""Terbert Jordkind."" :-) Cook has also largely eliminated the eternal magical teasing of One-Eye and Goblin, thank goodness.On to The White Rose."
2,Better than the first,"Better than the first.My second adventure with the Black Company was better than the first; centered around the reprehensible barkeep, Marron Shed, a weak man in heavy debt to money-lender gangs. We watched one of his only patrons, a slumming `hero' named Raven as he ""slipped farther into the darkness--for the highest of motives."" Gain the ""pragmatic amorality of a prince of Hell"" all for the side of `good'.And Shed, a murderer, robber, sex addicted seller of corpses (some not yet dead)--become something worthy.A twister and turner of the concepts of morality, ""Shadows Linger"" had me re-read the ""The Black Company"" and between the two books, going back and forth, the characters finally gained more substance.And despite themselves, infighting maneuvers oh the higher-ups shifted the pillaging and raping mercenary, Black Company from their current patron over to the side of `good'.Hum.The general background and story plot was decent and imaginative."
5,What's not to like?,"The same excellent writing and character development as the first one. By the time I was less than half-way through this volume I started ordering the next 5 books in the series (trust me, order them in advance as some of them, the 4th, I think was really hard to find).Why is this book great (other than the writing and character development, of course)? Because you can never tell who will end up being a good guy (or gal) and how long their ""goodness"" will last....If you want to embark on the fantasy ride of your life, read this series."
4,fairly odd parents season 2,"this one is good, at first it seemed like there might be aproblem,a couple small scratches,but so far it has played good,fingers crossed. i dont want to have to exchange this one as well,i hope not. but, if it starts to freeze up,etc.. i will have no choice but to return for another,thank you."
3,Fairly Odd Scam,"This DVD is way overpriced considering the fact that it only contains 12 episodes. Also, someone is recording the episodes off of the tv using on demand equipment, so I think charging so much money is a huge scam. I love the Fairly Oddparents, and was very excited to see that seasons of them are finally being released. But this is clearly a scam since the DVD of season 6 has the fairly oddbaby movie along with a bunch of other episodes and is way cheaper."
4,Grenada National Folk Ensemble Of Russia,"The actual name of the group is 'Grenada National Folk Ensemble Of Russia'. Album name is 'Crosscurrents Of Music Around The World'. The music is performed on real folk instruments, sung in languages of the lands where the songs originated. Tracks listed are correct. If you like folk music, give this a try. I don't know where 'Troika' came from; i can find it nowhere on the disc or inserts."
3,old fashioned battle,"Books as this I find are good and accurate respect to the impersonal details: size of ships, days and hours of the battles, number of men involved, equipment, etc. But they have a touch of jingoism that is very own of British raccounts of war and I think fully gone with World War II. In effect, references to past military glories abounds, the men are all full capable and brave, no one coward is seen. Even the Germans with his dangerous nazi ""Schnanrhorst"" and other battleships are seen as nostalgic, noble enemies. A point of view I believe fully innacceptable today as, I repeat, that isn't unusual to read in English war books, but industrial total war has demonstrated by far that today simply can't be fougth. We now know there's no man capable to stand several weeks of modern war withouth serious psychical consequences if no dead of psycally wounded. The sank of the Schnarnhorst is told in this book as a medieval battle and that is a counterfeit of the facts."
1,Incomplete,Sorry- I never did receive the book. I was informed that the sender was out of them. I still see the charge on my account.
2,Ok at best,"I just saw this, and it was okay. The soundtrack is good and the animation is alright, but I found the converted storyline to be rather weak. If you REALLY love Tekken, it would be a good purchase. Other than that, save your money."
2,One of the worst video game-animes ever,"Well for starters this move clocks in at just over an hour, making sure that you don't get you're moneys worth. Ok, well your a die hard Tekken fan, so money isn't that big of a deal, so hows the fighting. Uh well, fighting? Well there's quite a bit of fighting, but it's spread out and each fight last no longer than 20 or 30 seconds. It seems every fight is cut shor by something or other, until you get to the last fight which is a real bummer. Also in the movie, a certain Tekken 3 character (I'm trying not to spoil it) is cloned and released, but just makes the movie look all the more cheesier, which is the most crucial thing to step away from when making a video game movie. This movie should not be purchased, if you're a real fan just go to Blockbuster, this is something not even a mother could love. This movie is just a copy off of Mortal Kombat, which was adapted from Enter the Dragon."
2,Do Not Enter The Tekken!,"First of all, play the games before you see the movie. You will have no idea what's going on if you don't. If you have played the games before, you will understand it but I must warn you it's not all that great. It had its good points of course, for example the part where Nina drops down to attack Kazuya in his room was pretty cool. Other than that though, I found this movie to be somewhat boring. It is only an hour long but it seemed much longer. The action scenes could have been animated better also. This movie makes a good rental if you want to see what happens to some of your favorite Tekken characters."
3,"You've played the game, now see the....","How often have you heard those words used to plug an video game-based anime? Based on the first two TEKKEN games, this 2-episode OVA combines some elements of the Mortal Kombat movie with Jurassic Park. The Mishima Corp. plots to take over the world with its hybrid invisible dinosaurs and robot troopers. The main story involves Kazuya vs. Heihachi with Jun trying to lead Kazuya away from the dark side. The dub of TEKKEN features music by the Offspring and Stabbing Westward, plus the DVD has a rarity in English dubs: a French track. The action's okay. This anime also follows in the the TEKKEN 3 video game with the appearance of a very young Jin. Too bad most of the other fighters barely even get any speaking parts!"
5,short but fast paced and interesting,"The bad: a little short, could've used a few more fight scenes. The good: great character design and animation, Anna Williams, compelling story. I'm not a die hard fan of the game series (I love Tekken Tag-ps2 though) and so I didn't compare how well it was translated, in fact, it is probably better if you don't follow the game series that closely since video game translations are rarely well done (Darkstalkers was magnificent though). The package art doesn't really clue you in on the gem inside."
2,Not as good as it should of have been.,"My main gripe is from the lack of plot given to some of the characters- I felt they didn't give enough attention to Yoshimitsu, Paul, King, etc. Some of the characters don't even make an appearance and the story doesnt seem accurate- (When did dinosaurs ever have anything to do with the ending in Tekken 1?) The movie is watchable though as it doensnt stray TOO far from the series."
2,Terrible anime.,"Tekken is one of the worst animes ive ever seen.Its very bad.Its short,too and the extras on the DVD arent that great.It features music by the Offspring,though and it features most of the Tekken charectors.Rent it,dont buy it,unless you need everything Tekken."
1,You Are Better Off Playing the Game,"One of the worst animated films ever, Tekken is best avoided. If you so dearly need to watch this lousy movie, borrow it from a friend. Better yet, buy it and give it to someone you hate. Street Fighter II: The Movie has superior animation and fighting sequences while Tekken resembles an attempt to throw something together, hoping it will turn out all right. The best bet here is to watch South Park--it has better animation and will make you laugh (at the jokes, NOT the animation)."
1,Stay Away!,"Whoa! I was truely expecting more from this, seeing as how it evolved from one of the greatest fighting series in the world. After I saw this and Toshinden, I made sure I rented the anime before I bought it. Lets see...bad points: Poor art...lousy animation...character development too fast...rushed into an hour...bad action sequences...Good Points: The credits at the end. People who call this ""good high quality animation,"" should be beaten violently, along with the makers of this film. I have seen some bad anime in my life(Aika, Battle Arena Toshinden), and this ranks on up there in the junk heap. Hey, it even smells like garbage! This anime is best used as a gag gift. Don't buy it unless you are a hardcore Tekken fan, and don't care about how pathetic it is. I recommend Fatal Fury: The Motion Picture, or Street Fighter The Movie. Don't waste your time or money on this one."
5,Unbeatabal(Kazuya Mishima Rules!!!!),THIS MOVIE IS JUST KICK ASS THERE IS ONLY A GOOD:iT RULES ALL. I AM ALSO A TOTAL FAN OF THE VEDIO GAME SERIES. I AM THE MASTER WITH KAZUYA. I JUST THINK TEKKEN RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! KAZUYA BRINGS THE DEVIL IN IT. HE BRINGS THE MOVIE ALIVE! I GIVE THIS A TRIPLE THUMBS UP! WATCH IT!!!!!
1,A great deception :(,"I am a fan of Tekken, the video game.So first, I was happy that they release an anime. But that was a deception when i saw it... It's the worst anime i ever saw... The character design is poor... The graphism are bad... and The quality of animation are no even better... :("
2,Laugh out loud horrible!,"The only reason why I bought this movie was because it was there and I had the money to waste. Once again the Street Fighter 2-Animated Movie story line has been shamelessly ripped off. Too bad this fighting film offers no interesting battles (come on- one punch and the guy is dead/dying/outcold) and the animation is sub-par. But luckly, the film is so horrible that you can't help but laugh at it."
2,"Alas, so near yet so far....","I adore the Tekken game, and had high hopes for the anime. This movie would have soooo made it if only it was longer. Indeed I felt it was moving in the right direction in building the select few characters, but 60 minutes just isn't enough to tell the epic that Tekken is. So many characters were left out, and my idol Baek was squashed in mere seconds. The movie had good elements and flow, but each stage was rushed. Again, all due to the shortness of the movie. Even ever popular Paul was overlooked, and Kuma had a cameo appearance climbing down a tree. I mean, c'mon! Fight scenes are only half as good as SF2, with many still frame animation used. Not much fluidity and motion. Sigh. Still, my love for the game keeps me thinking that I still love this anime."
2,"Rent the movie, but do not buy it.","Tekken was okay, but the story in the movie was very unclear. Was it talking about Tekken 1 or Tekken 2. The movie should have been longer. I think someone should make another animated movie of Tekken and a nonanimated one. Why were the other characters such as Paul, King, and the others not describe well? There should have been more fighting scenes with them and what ever happen to Kazuya in the end of the movie? All these questions left me to think what is the movie trying to point out. The movie was not as good as I thought it would be. I recommend you rent the movie, but if you are truly a Tekken fan like me, you would be disappointed."
4,awesome movie,"I had just read reviews for this video a few days ago, and I couldn't believe the bad rep. it was getting. I've seen this movie and it had good animation, music, and a kickass storyline. I'm not saying it is the best movie in the world but it deserves more credit than people give it and I think the bad reviews that people placed online are kidish because they all say this;""The movie was bad because it didn't show all the characters"":()OH BOO HOO(),WELL for one thing the story was based on a main character and not 17PEOPLE!because if it had 17people, than the movie won't have a main character and the storyline will be jacked up and won't make any sense at all. The plot in tekken was better than i thought it would be. Also it was creative and thoughtful unlike most animes. Plus the dialogue and effects were perfect for the movie. So people should think more now on about how good the movie was instead of how dumber they will make the movie by writting their reviews that insult it."
1,Resellers are charging $45? Don't be fooled,"UGH,Horrible anime even by game anime standards. The dub is made worse by horrible American music that was stale when the orignal VHS was released.The story is VERY Loose on the dealings between Kazyua and Heihachi. Yoshimitsu a Tekken Favorite gets like no screen time.Stay away stay far away"
1,Total disgrace to the world of Tekken.,"Being a huge fan of Tekken games, I reserved a copy of ""Tekken: The Motion Picture"" literally months in advance. Only to be roundhouse kicked in the head with disappointment. The drawing quality is nowhere near that of other fighting game based Anime's. Fight sequences doesn't even come close to doing the game justice, which is known for spectacular moves and combos. The plot itself is decent, but presented so poorly that it leaves bad aftertaste. In comparison, ""Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie"" or ""Fatal Fury: The Motion picture"" are more refined and enjoyable to watch, despite the fact that I've always considered Tekken to be the superior and far more entertaining game. So if you are looking for an Anime based on Tekken, forget this one. You'll only feel disgraced by the shameful effort by the people representing the name Tekken. You'll have more fun watching the ending movie sequences in PlayStation Tekken games."
2,"Could have, and should have, been so much more.","I have seen this twice on cable and I tried so hard to like it, but I just couldn't. This has very little to offer in terms of story and character development. I have not played any of the games, besides Tag Tournament. The thing that prevents this from getting one star is that it is worth a couple of viewings but otherwise, stick with Akira, Princess Mononoke, and Ghost in The Shell and avoid this like the plague or if you're a fan of the games and haven't seen this, then rent it first."
5,Excellent film!!,"This movie was great I was really impressed... I thought it'd probably suck cause it was rated pg, but it had lots of action and blood the characters were cool... they could have made it a little longer and show a little more of the rest of the characters like King and Yoshimitsu and the rest in action but it was still cool, the only thing that I'd change is the length an make it longer...Great music too!"
3,TEKKEN as a movie? Pretty cool.,"When I first heard of a Tekken movie being produced and going to be released, I knew I had to get it. Well, I did and had mixed reviews. As a stand alone movie it is pretty good lots of action. On the other hand it doesn't quite reach the level of greatness the game does. It does also succeed in terms of a anime from a video game. It is better than Battle Arena Toshinden but not as good as Street Fighter 2 or Fatal Fury."
1,What????...Tekken???...More like CHICKEN!!!!,"Well for any of you Tekken fans out there, i'm afraid to say this is a big let down. To start with the animation is below standard, (Even Guyver animation was better than this, but that was exuuseable as it had a great storyline and loads of action) the storyline is keek, there are only one or two fights and it only focouses on a few of Tekken's characters, Jack, June, Lei Wou Long,...so on. So for any fans who expected to see all the characters from the Tekken world.....sorry you won't. Another flaw is that it only lasts 60 mins. Save your money and buy Street Fighter 2....And this is coming from a #1 Tekken fan."
2,Not worth your time...,"Warning. Do not even rent this anime. Sure, the writing in the beginning is cool and there are a few good monoloughes, but it gets soooo repetitive! It's the same thing over and over. The characters are faceless in personality and reduced to being classified by ""Good Guy"" & ""Bad Guy."" I'll save you time and money by telling you the theme now. ""Don't let your anger and need for revenge make you evil"" Between all the gore, you have a girl lectureing that point, more blood, a minor assassination, a jerk main character, and an aimless Jurassic Park sub-plot. Pu-lease! If you want to see fighting... get the game. If you want art...get Demon City SHinjuku. If uou wunna fall asleep.... try Tekken."
3,Pretty good....but not what I expected,"I am kind of a Tekken fan. I own two of the PlayStation games. I thought the movie should have had more of what the game was all about; fighting. Another thing that bugged me was the somewhat lack of realism. Geneticaly engineered fighting dinosaurs? Gimmie a break. And the coolest fight scene, the one between Kazuya and Heihachi, should have been longer. And I thought it should have been more uninterupted. The big explosion while they were fighting was not a nice touch. All these mistakes can and should be made up with a sequel, one that sums up the story of the game Tekken 3. And if this is made, PLEASE not so much speed lining and floating in mid-air during fights."
5,concrete wave,this book was kick [rear].If you want to learn your skateboard history this book is perfect for doing so.
1,badly jaded book,"Possibly one of the most lame jaded skateboard books written without good fact checking and bought and paid for by a fausto vitello mythology of SF- centric [stuff].It is full of horrible misconceptions and leaves out the real people who built the sport. It is total BS by a dude in the frozen north who is so detached from the scene.absolute GARBAGE, should be a 0."
5,Should be a staple in every skater's house,"Very interesting historical view on skating. Reads more like a magazine, (no wonder he started one) but in a good way. We are presented with articles basically, from key skaters throughout time. My only gripe is that he hasn't done a new edition, but I really can't complain about this book."
5,The 21st Chronicle of Gor & still a wonderful read! :),"Why did John Normans books ever go out of print? War on Gor is a rousing and fearful affair---and when the armada of Cos landed and began its sweeping arch against the mighty city of Ar, Tarl Cabot was swept up in their drive. Outcast from Port Kar, rejected by the Priest Kings, Tarl fought now for his own redemption. With comrades at his side, barbarian warriors and daring women, free and slave, his plans went forward---until the mercenaries of Dietrich of Tarnburg disrupted the struggle as a mysterious third force. MERCENARIES OF GOR brings into action all the magic and conflict of that counter-Earth, as Tarl became the center of intrigue and treachery in the city of his greatest enemies. Definetely worth trying to get your hands on. :)"
3,History of Jean Lafitte National Historic Park,"This a great resource for learning about the Jean Lafitte National Historial Park in Chalmette, La. It has lots of maps and charts and explains well about who the previous owners were and tells about the involvement in the War of 1812. The paperback study is superb, and I gave it 3 stars only because my copy was rather messed up."
4,The Art of Segmented Wood Turning,The Art of Segmented Wood Turning by Malcolm Tibbetts.Good book-very helpful-fast delivery. Will use often.
5,Woodworker and student,This book is an excellent guide for both beginners and advanced turners. More than adequate details are provided for the completion of any of the projects. I would recommend this book to anyone who has done or wants to do segmented turning.
5,want to learn segmented turning? get the book,"This book is extremely well written and easy to understand with its great attention to detail. The photos and writings in this book are very detailed from beginning to end. Its truly like taking a course having an instructor explaining to you its that well written. Read the book, the guy is a natural born teacher. The book is printed on high quality sturdy pages. the photos are great. The book is so well detailed that every doubt or question i had was always answered within a page and a half. no questions were unanswered. He tells you how to turn with minimal tools and without complex formulas. If your just starting out get this book it could save you lots of money time and heartache. this book could be used by intermediate turners as well. This is the most detailed and best written instructional book i have ever read with exception of an html book."
3,Not for beginners,"I had no idea what I was getting into when I purchased this book. I'm sure it is great instruction for advanced turners who have completed many segmented projects. If you are new to segmented turning ""this is not the book for you"" It would not be fair to the Author to rate this book poorly, although I do believe some indication of its advanced nature should be noted in the description. I'll put this book on the shelf and find a book that really explains segmented wood turning for the beginner."
4,"Great collection of songs, performed in traditional styles.","I've had this CD quite a while, glad to see it's getting some broad distribution on Amazon. Great collection of blues guitar instrumentals, and guitar songs with vocals. Like a ""best of"" compilation of essential guitar based blues. Wonderful slide work, vocals, and some great guitar sounds. As good as the traditional tunes are, I'm particularly fond of Bryan's solo instrumental ""Grace"", it speaks right to my heart. This CD is a great ""road trip"" CD, it's been my choice for many trips now. Well worth checking out."
2,Not what I expected,I brought this movie after doing a search on movies with Callum Keith Rennie in it...I watched it from start to finish trying to keep up with the subtitles and Callum wasn't in this version. Disappointed to say the least.
2,Ok but not great,This phone works OK if your not planning to walk around the house while chatting on it. About 5 or 6 feet away from the base unit the phone starts to install a clicking sound that gets louder the farther away you go. I suppose you get what you pay for in this instance.
2,Uniden EXI4245 Cordless Phone,"We purchased this phone based on positive reviews of this product. It is an easy to hold design, pleasant ring tone, and numerous other features. But, there is a tendency for static to be heard by both parties of the conversation. It is likely that the range is much more limited. It's ironic because it is touted as an extended range phone."
1,poor reception and constant static,"this phone has constant static and very poor reception, it constantly makes a clicking sound"
3,Heavy Mic,"The microphone itself was too heavy to be held upright from the stand. I tightened the screw to try to keep it in place better, but I ended up tearing the screw in half. Still a good microphone though."
1,Not working and worst ever !,"i bought it , but it didn't work !!! .. my advise not to buy it, go check another one."
3,ok-ish mic,i wuzn't satisfied with the sound quality with tha mic but it does work fine but i wouldnt really recommend this on unless u r a starter like me but now i think i'm pro.
2,There are better choices; move along.,"I taught out of this as a grad student at Wisconsin. Too short, not enough examples, not enough explanation. As a teacher there was simply not much there to rely on and I had to come up with my own explanations, ideas, and so on.I taught out of the eighth edition. The statement of Taylor's theorem (one of the major theorems of calculus) was WRONG. But, maybe I should be fair, they only had eight tries to get it right. I haven't looked at this edition, perhaps the ninth time is the charm."
3,Better than most...,"...but still somewhat difficult to understand. Most math textbooks are though. If you're looking to learn math on your own I would look elsewhere, if this is required for a class it's not the worst book you could be required to buy."
4,Good book for the price,"I was not very optimistic about getting this book for my calculus class, but I did anyway and must say it was worth it. The authors did a great job of making it easy to understand the concepts with lots of practice problems."
3,it's an average math book,Not the best book to have for a calculus course. Example are limited and often don't cover strategies needed to do problems in chapter. The things it does have examples for are done very well usually.
4,Good!,"Subject: Cal. 3Size: Not too small.Capacity of knowledge: plenty.Self instruction: yes.Manual workbook: $40.Readable: absolutely.Good for college students, but the downfall is that it's old and that it tends to use a few ancient methods of solving."
4,"Clear, systematic presentation","The book consistently presents calculus as a series of variations on a theme, which are returned to again and again. The emphasis is clearly on applying underlying concepts rather than memorization of a 'cookbook' of rote methods. There is a wide variety of problems, of varying difficulty, including several different areas of application. The book does assume that the student has thoroughly mastered college algebra; sometimes, in the interest of brevity, methods of solution are explained only briefly. The solutions manual is much more thorough and complete."
3,this book is excellent for a quick learner,"this book is excellent material for a quick learner. However the book lack details. the author assumes that student should be able do problems without giving examples.buy it if you want throw away your money.I think the author could do a better job example explaining derivates and limits. This book includes a answer book which is also a waste for money. Answer book should show details, not just answers. Also answers are provide for add number problems which are often less defficult to work. Its better than some calculus book i have used but definately not a good buy."
2,maths book review,"i received this book like almost a month after it was shipped. There is no way this book was tracked. The sellers also can't be contacted by phone, only email. And when you contact them by email, they will never ever reply you. The book was in a very very bad shape and condition. I regretted buying from that seller. I was two weeks behind my online class and up til now i can't catch up because a lot of work to do and i have many online classes too. Don't ever buy from them."
1,WORST TEXTBOOK EVER!!,"I have just recently finished the Calculus II course at the University of Utah. Varberg, Calculus with Differential Equations (9th ed.) is the required textbook for both Calculus I and Calculus II, so I've become very familiarized with the textbook and I can honestly say that this is the worst textbook I've ever had!.. The examples are extremely difficult to follow, as they skip many crucial steps (simply to save on print - hence, money) and the explanations are not written in a way that's easy to understand. Throughout both of my calculus I and calculus II courses I have had to use every available resource other than my textbook. If you can purchase any other textbook for your math class I would highly advise that you do so! This TEXTBOOK IS HORRIBLE!!! Do NOT waste your time or money!"
4,good but solutions manual is a must have,"This is a good book for calculus. I usually go to class and do not undestand the professor because he speaks a different language then come home and figure it out from the book. The solutions manual is a must have for this course unless you have an excellent teacher or tudor. I find it helpful to check my problems half-way through completing them to make sure I am on the right track. And when I do not understand the text book instructions, the solutions manual usually puts me on track."
3,"Unsuitable for those new to ""the Calculus.""","This is probably a good reference for advanced math students, teachers, mathematicians, etc. For newcomers to calculus, it's just hard to understand. As an adult learner who has learned math from books and is no stranger to self-directed studies, this book's math-speak explanations and ""abracadabra"" examples had all the calc newbies in my Calc I class bamboozled. Even my instructor had difficulty explaining the difference between her methods and the book's. Upon consulting other texts, the same concepts were easily revealed. The student solutions manual is, at times, as obscure as the text, sometimes leaving out significant steps. Some problems are explicated with different notation. In my humble opinion, Sylvanus Thompson's *Calculus Made Easy* and the HarperCollins' *Introduction to Calculus* and other ""easy calc"" books are better for introducing basic concepts to the calculus newbie."
5,Perhaps better than the original!,"Naturally I missed John Belushi and Cab Calloway, but the newcomers including John Goodman more than make up for their absences. More musical stars, a fun plot and great acting made Blues Brothers 2000 a must-have for my video library."
4,Can you say Sequel,Not as good as the orginal version but it's interesting enough. Got some decent music especially at the end of the movie.
1,Wrong item,"If it's the memory card pictured, it was the wrong one and I had to send it back. I got the right one and it works fine, smaller, but with the same GB. Too bad they can't standardize such stuff a bit more."
4,Great Gift,"A little over-priced, but my little sister and I loved the show and very much enjoy having them on dvd."
3,great show,"I love this cartoon, although I was disappointed when I saw that one of the disc's had a big scratch on it. It was supposed to be new...it played fine still so I guess I can not complain to much."
5,I wish there were more seasons,This show is great. Laugh-out-loud cartoons featuring Vendetta and Charlotte and all of Vendetta's fiends. I wish the creator made more . . .
1,Dell laser printer ink,"Hard to tell if the cartridge or the printer feed stopped working, but I've had fee problems with this printer since day 01."
4,the best wound strings available,I love the E A and D strings in this set. Because they are pollished they are the only ones that I have found that don't give me that annoying finger noise as I slide my hand along the neck. Interesting story: When I took my new guitar back to the guy who made it for a checkup the only change he made was to remove the strings I had put on and put these on instead! The long and the short of it is I either have to use these strings or hide the guitar from Val (the guy who made it).My one complaint is that the G string is wimpy. I usually replace it with another brand that has more power. Right now I have a Savarez plastic wound on nylon high tension (red card) G string. Its noticably louder than the D'Addario G string.
5,great plants,"I have gotten alot of plants before from online & mail nursery catalogs; and these plants were professionally wrapped & carefully packaged to withstand the ride to my home, these factors & a good price with healthy plants....couldn't ask for more....thank you!"
3,A very pleasing state it is,"A very pleasing collection of bluesy folk, soul, americana and country tunes, both upbeat and ballad styles. Fine harmonies and ""from the heart"" solos by veteran voices which compliment the musical selections. The more you listen the more you are pulled into these tunes. It sounds like the fellas had fun singing and playing. The smiling faces on the CD sleeve belie this feeling. After listening one is certainly happy all over."
2,Will not recommend to anyone,Only one connection worked. But it is so delicate that if you move a little the quality was degrading. I could not even close the outlet. Luckilly my bookshelf is hiding it. Once it works the quality is good.
5,Outstanding,"If you are ""OLD SCHOOL"" and have not heard of Frankie Beverly and Maze I would be surprised They are my favorite band If you are looking for inspiration, somthing to make a bad day better I would suggest Frankie Beverly and Maze when ever they come to Las Vegas I am there. I am dissapointed that they have not recieved any recognition for their music. I own every vinyl record they have made and now the cd's. If you ever get the chance to see them live GO you will leave with happy feelings."
5,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE","On my ""To Do"" List for 2013 is to attend a concert. Each time they are in my area, their concert is sold out immediately. I check their schedule weekly to see if there are any updates."
3,A real review for the rest of us!,"If I had to do this again ... well let's just say I don't like being punished. I like the unit for it's flexibility. I think anyone can easily set it up. If your an IT guy, like myself, you will really like the firewall options, although the logging has little to be desired. Now why the (3) three stars? The unit is not reliable! My wired and wireless connection keep dropping. I'm using DSL (PPPOE) and it just cannot keep the connection active. I just installed the newest firmware, ver 2.70, and it's still not working right. I have tried everything to really like this unit, but I would not suggest this to anyone, actually I did to several people, which I of course will retract any praise. Maybe D-Link will get it right next time. For now I will have to call them (D)efective-link."
5,Easy to install,"took me all of two minutes to install, the card needed the cd. The router was plug & play. Works great haven't found a problem yet."
3,Matching Adaptor has horrible reviews,"This Router is fine but the reviews on the matching adaptor/wirless card are terrible. Therefore, it makes no sense to buy this router. I would suggest to buy a router that has a matching wirless card/adaptor that is good as well. From what I've read, Lynksys makes a good set."
4,"Great product, not so great driver","Setup was quick and simple. Only problem I had was with the card's driver and utility, couldn't get the utility to work, and wireless connection was not always established. Installing the Atheros 4.1.2.71 driver fixed that - have access to the Atheros utility and connection is stable."
2,more drops then works,"Looks good, range is great, can not complain about security. But Speed was a bad story. Wireless speed was fast at the beginning but after day or two start to slow down and then it will drop. Every 3 days i run in to the basement to reset it manually. Connection was unstable.Got other brand and all my problems are gone."
5,D-Link! Affordable and excellent quality.,"I bought this to replace my old 802.11b Linksys routers. I was quite happy with the setup and it's fairly comprehensive options for a small/medium network. I was so happy, I use this for my company's 15 user internal network. Decent reception at 300 feet in between cheap/thin walls - maybe 2-2.5"" at most.Bought a couple more for backup in case of hardware failure; especially since I can always use the PCMCIA cards."
3,good after a firmware update,"the card works great, but the router keep disconnecting or restarting every 5 minutes, after 2 weeks i just put it away and keep using my linksys, a couple of monts ago the linksys die, so i dusted this one out of the box update the firmware and its been working fine ever since no more restarts or disconnecting"
4,Works very well!,This product is very good and it's working very well. I just need to figure out how to share my printer! But I think that's only about configurations.
3,Wireless router and card,"Router is OK, but have not been able to make the wireless card work for my IBM Thinkpad T20 and I have been frustrated by the lack of support."
1,Performance of D Link Wireless DI-624,My DLink keeps dropping signal. Every two three days I have to power cycle the box to make it work. Not a good router.
2,Worked great ... for two days,"The router worked great for two days (installation was easy), then the signal strength decayed to next-to-nothing. I brought my laptop up about ten feet away from the router and could not get a reliable signal. Over the first two days, the signal strength was excellent. Two calls to tech support did not resolve the matter, with the technician telling me to return the unit. So, I'm off to do that, now. The first call to tech support landed me somewhere around the other side of the planet, where the connection was awful and I could not understand the heavily accented voice on the other end.I also have a D-Link Internet camera, which works flawlessly. For the first two days, the D-Link wireless router did also. After reading the other reviews here, my impression is that D-Link makes great products, but that their quality control may be lacking. It seems sort of hit and miss."
4,"Fire, fire in da house,call jericho to put it out !","This is truly madness, the lyrics mixed with a bit of Liam Magic gives you this cd. Rippin' Up The Sound Boards With The Prodigy ! -RESPECT-"
3,bigger than expecteed: snap closure not secure,"This is a cute midsized-large bag, larger than I estimated, but still carries well over the shoulder and does not feel as large as it looks. My biggest beef is that all the pocket's are at the front, once loaded up if tilted in that direction or slightly shook, the main clasp falls open. I haven't gone out with the bag yet and am opting to keep it because it is just too cute. However, it will probably be my last online handbag purchase as it would have helped to see it in person and test these things out before hand. It does open wide which is very nice. I'm just hoping I don't regret not returning it!"
3,not heavy duty,"I purchased a set of 4 Steelex casters (2 w/double brakes)to place under a 48""L x 24""H x 20""D cabinet weighing approx 325 lbs. I like to go at least twice the rated capacity, so this seemed a good choice. It does a fair job of rolling, but the sqeaking is a bit annoying. You get what you pay for, I would not recommend this for heavy duty applications."
3,Only if you like chocolate mint...,"I think taste of this mint is very unique. So, some like it. Others do not. You should try it. When you put it in your mouth, you can taste a strong chocolate flavor. But, there is a good balance of mint flavor coming after that.I prefer eating chocolate and mint separately :)"
4,Very interesting non-fiction from the great writer,"Though I'd like to have had another work of fiction, this book of various and sundry non-fiction is most interesting when Mr. Fowles writes about his own fiction and his thoughts on the process of fiction in these post-modern times.Indispensable to any admirer of Mr. Fowles fiction."
3,Time for a change?,"I have made four trips to Australia using various versions of this guide. You have to remember that it started off as a backpacker's/ alternative travel guide and has kept the strengths (in depth coverage of offthe beaten track areas) as well as the weaknesses (concentrates on low end travellers) of that approach. It needs to be not just revised and updated but also completely rewritten from scratch. The book is also geared to the traveller who is already in Australia. For example, it is extremely sparing in giving out email addresses and, after all these editions, still does not give the Australian postcodes for places. In its attempt to cover the entire country, it has also gotten very bulky and inconvenient.I like Lonely Planet and its guides, but I think that it is time for them to either abandon or change the focus of this country-wide guide. In the meantime, I am relying on their series of Australian State guides for my next trip."
2,Disappointing LP Offering,"I was relatively disappointed with LP's Australia offering - I've been told that The Rough Guide is better. The book provided information typically found in LP guides, but was inadequate in numerous areas - particularly in providing comprehensive lists of tour operators and hostels. As with most LP books, it was short on advice and in-depth information on places, but provided valuable basic information on destinations. It was certainly better than not having a guide, but I missed out on some great opportunities because the guide's information was inadequate."
3,Excellent - but disappointing in parts -,"An excellent read, enjoyed the review of the places of interest, public transport and the flora and fauna of Australia. I decided to totally ignore your advise on Hostels as you where more often than not wrong - I am not sure on what angle you look and inspect the hostels - but it was obvious that you never stayed the night. Apart from that moan I really enjoyed the book - and Have a whole stack of other countries to plough through."
3,"a very well written book, but lacking depth in the book","the book had an artistacal view and in depth information in some areas, but most over all the book was a very lacking biography type. it needed more info on the perpetual level and needed to be more ribbed. but otherwise a funny, yet witty book. 3 stars"
3,cavite,"Fast paced, exciting, and lots of great shots of everyday life in the suburbs of manila. A bit hard to follow and very disturbing. Worth a look for sure."
5,Terror,"About as spooky as a movie can be.A man (though we know he could stand for many) is manipulated by a political terrorist (he, too, could stand for many) into an act of terrorism. The manipulated man's reward? The release of his kidnapped mother and sister. . .perhaps.Spookiest is--as the movie timer clicks out--we know this film isn't over."
5,It's deeper by being more artless,"Contrary to the reviewer who can't spell Philippine, and doubtless speaks no Filipino, I found this movie spellbinding. It appears to be a one family (!) production and certainly didn't cost a lot to make. There are many street shots of people who, I am certain, did not know they were being filmed. It is profoundly implausible, and the ""terrorist"" on the phone did not even know how to pronounce Quiapo, but I had no trouble at all understanding what he said.So I'm not sure what to make of it, but I bought it and will watch it again. People who seek an insight into the world of hundreds of millions of other people could do a lot worse.And maybe that's the hook of this movie. It does troll the raw existence of many, many people. Mainstream American movies should only hope to show a glimmer of the same relation to reality."
5,Exciting and terrifying,"""Cavite"" is the most exciting and terifying movie I've seen this year.No other movie can claim it can get this deep inside the mind of the central antagonist/terrorist character. Watching it is like a jolting blend of ""Seven"", ""The Killing Fields"" and Lino Brocka's ""Maynila"". Congratulations on great work to the directors and don't worry about Sundance...you can create your own."
4,No actual picture of the container...,"These sprinkles are great colors, and work perfectly for what I am using them for. But the container they come in is very short and doesnt come with that much sprinkles."
5,Superb,"All products from wilton are absolutely incredible. These are not tiny balls of sprinkles, they are slightly bigger and just what I was looking for for the cake idea I had. A must buy for fabulous ideas. Arrived quickly : ) so that was a plus."
1,missing format,"I loved ""Space Chimp"", but I will not be buying the sequel. The reason is there is no full screen. ""Space Chimp"" was widescreen and full screen to accomodate everyone, but ""Space Chimps 2"" has only widescreen. If it had full screen too then I would have bought it, if for no other reason then because I loved the first one so much."
2,love the first one....the second is not as good....,"we seen it before...they make a movie...we love it...they make a second one....itkinda stinks. I really enjoyed the first one...and was happy that a second onewas made. But once you spend your hard earned money for the sequel, within minutesyou know that you've been had. Space Chimp 2 does'nt have the magic from the firstone...what changed ? One problem it seems that not all the same actors came backfor the sequel and with that im sure there are several elements. So now im stuckwith this below par sequel....but ill give it another chance on one of those rainydays...i have too, cause i sure did'nt get my money's worth with the first showing."
2,Space Chimps 2 is awful.,"Space Chimps 2 is unbearable. I bought it for my 3 year old for Valentine's Day because he loves the original Space Chimps. I wish I could return it. The animation is horrible. The voices of Zartog and Hamm are so far from the original its ridiculous. They sound so flat. Also, what annoys me is that Luna hates Hamm again...and that is not how the first movie ended. It gets 2 stars because my kid loves it....which is extremely unfortunate for me...."
4,Still the same old Yngwie,"Despite the bunch of imitators and new trends on pop music, Yngwie is still faithfull to the style he developed in the 80's: ""Neo classical heavy metal"". This compilation is good starting point for those who just want to know about Yngwie, eventhough ""Rising Force"" and ""Trilogy"" have some of the best compositions he has ever made. He may not sound as fresh as he did in 1984, but the music he's playing today have the same energy, structure and astonishing technique. Check out some tracks like ""Seventh Sign"", ""Like an Angel"", ""Hangar 18,Area 51"" and ""Cavalino Rampante""If you like Yngwie or flashy-technical guitar playing this album or any other album by Yngwie Malmsteen will please you."
4,"Good stuff, More spice would be nice.","This is good vanilla chai, much better than the junk Big Train puts out. I wish it had a tad more spices though."
1,No flavor,"Very disappointed in this product. It lacks vanilla and chai flavors. I tried mixing as directed; mixing with more product - maybe adding my own spices will help. The BEST vanilla chai I've had is Oregon ChaiOregon Chai Vanilla Tea Latte Mix, 8-Ounces (Pack of 6). Oregon Chai's regular flavor is also top notch. I even liked the Mystic ChaiMystic Chai Spiced Tea Mix - 2 lbI bought at Sam's a lot better. Even Starbucks' Tazo Chai tastes better than this product. Don't waste your money.Since the vanilla varieties aren't very tasty, I have mixed the original versions and added a splash of Vanilla milk."
3,Not that bad,"The book was great for information and gave a good overall standing on the religions of Asia. I had two problems with it though, the first being that it was a pretty dry read and made it hard to stay focus while reading it. The second being how long the informational background information that was given before parts of the actual text. The informational sections were at times longer than the actual reading itself."
4,these are not love songs,"This is not the death of PiL that many fans are calling it. There are some great songs here. ""1981"" is cool - great drums, great lyric , reminds me of the Flowers of Romance album, which i love . ""Tie me to the Length of That"" has a spooky Vincent Price vibe to the lyric and vocal, and a welcome return to a hooky bassline. ""The Order of Death"", despite being featured in an episode of Miami Vice - uuuugh - is one the best Pil songs ever, its chants of ""this is what you want, this is what you get"" becoming more and more bitter and sarcastic the more they are repeated. Even the then-current Brit-funk experimentations of ""Bad Life"" and ""This is Not a Love Song"" cannot hold them back. They have an undeniable energy, despite their somewhat dated sound. This is, after all, 1983. And a sight better than Kajagoogo or A-ha."
2,I didn't want this but I got it,"""This Is What You Want...This Is What You Get"" was the weakest link in the shaky chain of PiL's output in the '80s. Vapid and pretentious, the album is not danceable, is not emotionally engaging, it doesn't rock, and basically stands for everything I thought John Lydon was against: overproduced ego-stroking. ""Bad Life"" and ""The Dance of Death"" are the only stand-outs, which, in essence, makes the album a decent single. Stick with Second Issue or The Flowers of Romance for good PiL."
5,OLTRE IL PUNK A MILLE!,"se Mr. Lydon è stato il deus ex machina dei Sex Pistols nell'acronimo P.I.L. sembra voler rimarcare cio' che molti fans gia' sapevano:la sua vena creativa non era esaurita ed il percorso punk poteva dare emozioni anche oltre il suo stesso rito.Ascoltate la doppietta ""this is not a love song"" e ""solitaire"" e datemi ragione.grazie"
1,The original...,"...is called 'Commercial Zone' or formerly 'You Are Now Entering a Commercial Zone'. It is, from what I understand, Keith's version of the album, and is a hundred times better. This album is DISCO crap. The title is a joke (really) on the fans, Johnny saying 'this is what you THINK you want? well I'll give it to you and then you'll see just how much you'd rather hear what I USED to do...' Find 'Commercial Zone' any way you can, there are actual GUITARS on it! This is all processed guitar and horns and disco beats and CRAP, with Johnny's 'cockney Tiny Tim' vocals and his trademark (extremely stupid) trailing his voice upward at the end of every line. This is where PiL ended. Actually, it ended with the FIRST note of this album, not the last. Save your money, it sucks."
3,Groove to the disco stylings of John Lydon!,"It seemed as though Lydon wasn't totally sure where to take ""This is What You Get"". There a good balance of both PIL's styles on here; early amelodic ""experimental"" crap and 80's synth pop with a dash of disco thrown in. Without a doubt, I prefer the latter. Yeah, it's not very punk, but neither is John Lydon. Sex Pistols fans would mess themselves if they heard their idol gleefully wailing along to the disco tune ""Solitaire"". Too bad you'd never be able to get those stupid Punkers near this record; they're so narrow-minded about listening to music other than Punk Rock. ""Solitaire"" a very good song, along with ""This is Not a Love Song"", ""Tie Me to the Length of That"", and ""Order of Death"". ""Pardon"" is the worst song on here, but it should appeal to all those stuffy ""art"" critics who loved Second Edition and praised it for having a complete lack of a little thing our ears identify as music.3.5/5"
2,something to watch out,"The story revolves around four guys (Shreyas Talpade, Javed Jaffery, Aashish Choudhary, Vatsal Seth).The chemistry between the guys is something to watch out for. It seems like the scenes between them have been shot without any retakes. There is a scene when all of them are drunk and cursing Asrani and he is standing right behind them, which is one of the funniest scenes in the movie. Shreyas and Javed are natural actors and occupy more screen time than the other two.The other characters in the movie give a decent performance too. Chunky Pandey plays a stuttering goon, Johnny Lever as his sardar brother and Dilnaz as Jhonny's gujarati wife. Dilnaz's dialogues have been nicely written and superbly delivered."
2,not cello,"I was disappointed - these are not clear cello bags, but some sort of plastic bag. Cello bags I've gotten in the past (at Michael's) have been prettier and stiffer."
2,"OK, not Great.","The colors for this concealer are pretty good, but i have a major problem with the texture. It is thick and sticky and tugs at my skin. Hard to get the right amount and impossible to blend, making it very obvious. I know it is a corrector, but even with foundation or other concealer over it, the end result is not good. The tub also dried out really quickly making it even harder to use. I was blending the darker color in with my previous concealer which did help brighten it up a bit, but definitely not worth the purchase. For me the quality was just not there!"
2,"More ""metal"" than ""black""","Metal Black is a poor imitation of Venom's seminal album Black Metal. The reason why Black Metal worked so well is because the band put themselves out there in such an original way that it was hard not to notice the audacity of three guys from England who dared place on an LP jacket an overwhelmingly evil, menacing anthropomorphized goat's head in front of a pure black background that signified the beginning of the end of humanity.To try to recapture that one magical moment, when everything fell into place and no one else was doing what they were doing, in 2006, is futile.I'm the type of fan who expects his favorite band to try something different, change things up, and yet keep the same intensity, drive and passion for their style of music. It's a sad state of affairs when a band feels they have to copy their old selves in order to re-invent their new selves."
3,OK but worth it,Venom can never top the days of WTH and BM but this is better than their (actually only Cronos is involved) other efforts.
3,Venom?,"Hmmm, I was really excited about this cd, but then I heard it, and it was definatly not as good as I would have anticipated. ""Antechrist"" is my favorite song on the cd, and the rest of the songs just kinda sound the same. ""House Of Pain"" and ""Metal Black"" are pretty cool tracks too, but this cd is missing something."
3,Venom Returns,"Metal Black is Venom's new cd and I think that it is just ok. I am a big Venom fan but I think this new album does not have the catchy songs that the band's earlier records have. Production on the new album is the best that Venom has ever done. It sounds great! I think it is probably their heaviest sounding cd to date. The musicianship is also at it's peak. I always knew Venom was capable of good chops. Maybe I am just old-fashioned when it comes to my metal because there are only a handful of songs on Metal Black that I like whereas, I like every song on Venom's 1st four records. I recommend the new Venom to hardcore fans only."
2,"Opposite, Yes","Fitting that they reversed the title, because this album bears no resemblance to the masterpiece to which it alludes. There is some redeeming value here -- like Darkest Realm -- but not much. Trying to strip down modern recording just for the sake of re-capturing something is an admission (to me) that Cronos just doesn't have it anymore. Re-hashed lyrics, re-hashed riffs, put to sub-standard recording adds up to a mess of an album...go back and re-visit the original and see if you don't agree."
2,Metal Black/Layeth Hideous Satani Smackdown with deafening disaster!,"Metal Black seems too disturbed even for Venom! A bombastic offering lacking great production and interesting metal-music direction. It's just total chaos from start to finish! This is a poor showing for Cronus & co. The band can do much better than this!What a disappointing return for Venom to the their old-school roots! INMOP., it falls short of the early day releases and the most recent killer album Resurrection(2000)! The entire effort has too much roar and not enough score! Bottomline, Metal Black/Layeth Hideous Satani Smackdown with deafening disaster! Back to the drawing board fellas!"
3,An average metal album,Nothing special. An album that its not bad and its not good. I'm total neutral. Maybe if the songs where a little more slow and heavy the result would have been better. The sound of the bass is too loud and i dont like it too much. only tha cover is very good. Lets say a must for Venom fans but i don't know if general metal fans would like this album.
3,Venom:Metal Black,"I really hate to give one my favorite bands a mediocre review.But this is the first venom album that didn't keep my attention.It certainly isn't their best nor a successor to welcome to hell, black metal,or war with satan.Which i originally had hopes for,considering the albums title.These tracks are in my opinion are the cream of the top.1.Antechrist5.Rege Satanas6.Darkest Realm8.AssassinTheir prior album ""Resurrection"" is far more powerful.If your a ""DIE HARD"" (pun intended) venom fan its a must have.Just dont expect the coming of the ""Antechrist"" (puns just roll out,sorry) while listening to it"
5,Great Addition to my layout,This is one of those items that you don't know about until you see it somewhereIt saves time putting your train on the tracks Highly recoomended
1,Fast Track Railer,I thought it was a waste of money! It was supposjed to be compatable with o gauge but I can't get it to work at all! The spacing is obviously made for a bigger train! Wasn't enough money to bother sending back so I feel it was just a ripp off!
5,Well Done,This is not NFL Film quality but it's close. Most college DVD's lack in-depth shots and just replay what I already viewed on TV or SportsCenter. This is unique in that it showed the bench and locker room before and after the game.
5,vocabulary,excellent book. great for grades 5 and higher. helps in teaching the the latin and greek roots. students really start to understand 'how words came to be.' book 1 is also recommended.
1,Horrid,"This is quite possibly one of the worst books I have ever read. I was very excited when I started, the subject being the kind that I am really interested in but, 200 pages in, only three days had been covered. If you like a book about people standing around doing nothing this is your kind of book."
2,Rather Disappointing,So I was so looking forward to this book. I started to read it and my first thoughts were WHAT??? This doesn't seem to be in L. Chaikin's style at all. I found the characters 2D. They didn't have anything about them that drew me. I found Rachelle rather sappy. Fabien well wasn't very competent. I like stories where they don't have everything happen right but this was just plain retarded. I also like stories w/real history but I felt the story was overwhelmed by the history and just plain rambling of this person and this or such.
1,Do not read,Thos is an incomplete four part series where the last book was never written - and ends on a cliffhanger. Betrayal by the publisher. Waste of time and money - and the typos and incorrect use of French is painful.
2,Almost interesting.,"I have read several Linda Chaikin books, but this one had so many historical characters and incidents, then a ton of French words thrown in. I finally gave up after 200 pages. It was just too much work to follow the story with the French dictionary, a map of France so you could follow their travels, three family trees, and a two-page list of the characters. If I wanted history, I would just get a history book. I really was looking for historical fiction, emphasis on the fiction. Two stars for all the research that had to have gone into this book. Just no flow to the story."
3,Deadsville...,"THE LOCALS is a good supernatural creeper. Filmed in New Zealand on an extremely low budget, the movie uses like-able characters and a decent storyline to make up for any lack of fx or grandiose locations. If you enjoy ghost stories, then this should be a nice addition to your spook-shelf..."
5,I forgot how good this is!,"This is one of those reviews where I feel kind of limited in what I can say about the movie itself because I don't want to give anything away.But it does have suspense, great characters, a good storyline and never succumbs to a common flaw of many modern horror movies. Far too many horror movies these days try to explain the mysterious elements of their stories but fail to provide an explanation that makes sense. The element of mystery is usually scarier anyway. We know that there's supernatural elements, and how they work as much as is necessary. It doesn't matter that we don't know why they work they way they do or how they came to be.The bad? Well nothing serious; the only minor problem is that a couple of times things we learn could have been more effective if they'd been delayed slightly.It had actually been about sixteen months since I last saw this flick and I forgot how great it is."
1,"Mediocre. Very, very mediocre","A rather indifferent mystery. There really aren't any likeable characters, and it takes forever for one of them to die. It was the revelation of whodunnit that irritated me extremely. To go into further detail would be to ruin the plot. It... well, while not unplausible, it was inadequately telegraphed for my taste.This story was all wrong in the details; the numerous ""news clippings"" sounded nothing like actual articles. And furthermore, rather than ending at the point which would have provided a certain degree of spookiness (guilty... or are they? and will they ever be brought to justice?), the author ends the whole thing with another stupid news article that makes everything Painfully Crystal Clear.In short: don't waste your time."
4,Just like a laptop power adapter except for the plug.,I am using this power adapter with a Pentax K-7 and it works well. It is built just like a laptop computer power adapter except for the plug where it connects to the camera. That plug is the only small gripe I have - it is a bit hard to tell which way it should be plugged in since the markings are hard to see and the plug is small.
3,You got to be kidding me ?,"Just got my K10D yesterday, and have yet to take a picture with it, due to my sdhc card being late, yet I can't see why this item is necessary. I won't charge the battery while connected to the camara, and for that much cash, it should. Really, unless your shooting a lot of pics in a studio, why would you need it ?What I would like to see instead is a sony like product that charges multiple batteries, comes with both a ac and dc charger system for the car or boat... and charges the battery in camera.So I think I'll pass on this one."
1,Kirkland dismissed,This summary of Kirkland's literary career dismisses all of Kirkland's work other than her first two frontier books. It belittles and blatantly misreads her writing and contains significant errors. It does little other than obscure the significance of this important writer.
5,Exactly the system we needed,"We bought this pump after going through 2 others in a very short period of time. Also bought a DE filter from the same company. Our pool is absolutely sparkly clear and clean now, from being a green slimy mess. It was shipped in a timely manner and we couldn't be happier with our choice. We did a lot of reading and research about how the pumps and filter systems work and what would be best for us. Don't just buy any size pump unless you've done your research."
5,Great Pump... Has made pool maintenace so much easier!,"Replaced our old worn out 1hp pump with this one. We used to have so many issues with keeping chemistry in check and algae in our pool. I always suspected that the pump was too small/didn't move enough water. It was installed when we bought our house. This pump has made a huge differnce. We used to run the old pump 24/7 and it couldn't do what this pump doees in less than half the time. We run it 10hrs. per day. 10am-8pm and have beautiful crystal clear water in our 18x33x48"" above ground pool. 15-16000 gallons."
4,Talk to them,"I bought this Hayward SP1593, 1.5 hp pump in June 2012. It was to replace a pump which run for 7 years. Installed it and was in service by end of July. worked well for five months, but started making noise in early Nov.(2012) and soon stopped working. I was very disappointed, specially since I couldn't find how the warrantee worked, and none of the local dealers wanted to deal with it. In desperation I wrote a lousy review and sent a quick note to Hayward customer service. I was planning to buy a new, no Hayward, pump. To my surprise Hayward's customer service wrote back the next day, and informed me that they are sending me a new pump. I should have it in a few days, i was informed. As important as the pump itself, it was the service which I truly appreciated.My recommendation to Hayward Co. is to make their warrantee program more accessible and simpler to follow; and if you own a Hayward pump and are having problems, talk to them."
5,Great item for a great price,Can't believe how quickly this item arrived. It looks like it will be perfect for our application which is an 18 ft above ground pool.
2,Description not correct.,"Amazon advertised it as an above AND in ground pool pump and at 1.5 hp….the pump does NOT function well at all with proper piping as an in ground pool pump; the flow rate was vastly insufficient. Looked up Hayward pumps, after Amazon purchase and the manufacturer specified the pump as Above Ground duty ONLY. In addition, most pumps are rated at dual voltage 120/220V and the Amazon post never clarified if the pump motor was single or dual voltage. Further Amazon postings of this model pool pump should clarify 120V ONLY please."
2,Hayward,I am on my THIRD pump in 3 years the filter system works great when it works the pump has issues needs to be made to last longer the old pump and filter I replaced lasted 10+ years.
4,works good,The pump works good even if a little bit noisy. The only problem I had was with the next day shipping - it took 4 days to get to me. However Amazon refunded my shipping cost 100%.
5,Hayward Pool Pump,Replaced original pool pump....Was able to purchase through Amazon from (In the swim)cheaper than buying it direct from In The Swim....Go figure....Overall good pump....OEM Part....
4,hayward power flo sp1593,Works great and does the job but a bit loud. Would recommend future customers in investing a little more money in obtaining variable speed switch.Very pleased with timely shipping.
2,Great when they are working...but that won' last long.,"I am about to replace my third pump (all this same make and model) over a 5 or 6 year period. Everything is correctly installed and relegiously maintained, runs 8 hrs. a day from June to mid September and it is put inside the house for the winter. They run fantastic for about a year and 1/2 to two years, and then just burn out. Getting sick of these disposable pumps. They wouldn't dare warranty them for a two year period. Probably being made in China now!"
1,dissappointed,I purchased this Hayward pump 2 years ago and the motor failed today. Hayward customer service said sorry it only has a 1 year warranty. pretty much out of luck. This pump only ran 8 hours a day from june thru september.Also drained and removed from service every winter and stored in garage. my first pool pump was over 6 years old before it failed and it was a generic brand. I thought when I bought Hayward I was buying from a company that would back their product better then they are... I am very dissappointed and unsure if I should purchase another Hayward product. Looking at the reviews for this pump I think I must of bought a lemon.
2,Got to be a die hard fan to listen to this!,"Listen, on the surface this pretty much stinks.Sex Pistols was rock music. This is noisy, in your face, purposefully abrasive.However, at the time, it was definitely ground breaking. The guitar playing was avante garde/Sonic Youth before that type of music came into vogue. The bass playing was also innovative.""Public Image"" is a decent song, ""Anastasia"" is all right, the rest of the album is headache inducing.The band reached its zenith on 2nd Edition with the cool dub sounds and screaching guitar.In real life, John Lydon is a jerky and abrasive person. This record was not only to isolate himself from the pistols but, it was also giving a middle finger to the public.I saw him live circa 1979. He was terrible, performed behind a screen, and never acknowledged the audience.I do not think that this album was a serious artistic endeavor."
2,"We don't write Pop, we write Motion Picture Soundtracks","I'll always remember seeing American Bandstand, with PIL performing the only danceable song off this. PIL was wandering around as teens bopped, not even remotely pretending to lip sync, Lydon banging the cymbals with his microphone."
4,Ice Water in the Face,"He's obviously an obtuse, arrogant prick, but I love John Lydon. I've read his autobiography several times over and have listened almost obsessively to all of his records with PiL, the good and the bad.PiL's debut was a splash of ice-cold water in the face of anyone expecting the former Johnny Rotten to put out Sex Pistols Mach II. Indeed, the album's lurching, seasick opener ""Theme"" quickly puts paid to any notions that ol' Johnny cares about keeping his Pistols fans. Most of the album consists of long, repetitive vamps, anchored by Jah Wobble's tubby dub bass foundations and topped off with Keith Levine's jagged shards of trebly post-punk noise guitar and of course, Lydon's vituperative rants. Only the quasi-title track, ""Public Image,"" bears a traditional song structure and it turns out to be an anthemic punk rock classic without even trying."
4,Stunning Material mixed with filler,"Definitely a progression from the Sex Pistols and an interesting artistic statement. For their first two records or so (up until they kicked Wobble out) PIL had some real musical muscle, then they quickly devolved into nothingness.""Public Image"" is a brilliant forceful song which musically sets the foundation for the whole of U2's original sound, among other things. ""Religion II"" is a strong forceful track - as with later efforts, the distinction is in the recording and mixing process, it takes the material a step up. The rest of this is so-so or outright lousy. ""Theme"" is not as powerful as on the ""Paris au Printemps"" version. ""Fodderstompf"" announces itself as filler, and is (that's Wobble's voice on there, by the way). I find ""Annalisa"" totally unlistenable and heavy-metallic."
5,John Lydon throws off the shackles of punk...,"but don't let the headline fool you into thinking that he's the main event here. Sure, his inventive vocals front the band, but the contributions of Keith Levene (guitar), Martyn Atkins (drums) and especially the driving and/or dubby bass of Jah Wobble are of at least the same importance. Although Metal Box/Second Edition gets a lot more press, this is the album that sounded the clarion call for the battle over the dead carcass of punk. And, in a twisted bit of irony, it also contains perhaps the poppiest song in the PIL discography (Public Image) which shoulda/coulda/woulda been a worldwide hit in a just world."
1,Where's The Meat?,"This is probably the all-time worst self-help series I have ever heard. Lucinda Bassett is a shallow motor-mouth who can talk endlessly on any subject & never actually say anything. I would say her genius lies in creating all these self-help products out of nothing at all, & then making them appear to be something. There is no meat here at all, it's empty, sophomoric marketing nonsense. Serious waste of money."
1,price,I am disappointed with the charge for this item. If I find the program for a reasonable price and it works for me I will gladly give it to someone who needs it.
2,"Concepts are sound, but CDs are awful","I agree with another reviewer that the CDs are not helpful at all. It's a bunch of people sitting around with Lucinda chit chatting about their anxiety. The concepts in the books are pretty good, but this whole set is incredibly overpriced for what you get. I feel like Lucinda and her company prey on the vulnerable. If it were really about helping people, the materials wouldn't be nearly so high-priced. And then they try to sell you a bunch of extras, like $30/bottle herbal supplements and crazy pricey phone therapy sessions. Save your money and get real help face-to-face with a therapist or with meatier less expensive self-help books."
2,Florsheim Keaton Slip-on,"Nice looking shoe. Wasn't the shade of ""cognac"" that I would have preferred (expected something a tad lighter in color). Took a chance in ordering a half size larger because that's all was avail; and it was being offered at a rather inexpensive price. Comfortable initially - plenty of cushion. However, after two wears, heels started to slip while walking and toes started to slide forward. Shoe is also a bit heavy. If I had to do it all over again, I'd attempt to get this shoe in my true size, which I imagine would be very snug initially, and attempt to break them in after three to four wears. Overall, I'd give this shoe 2 1/2 stars out of five."
2,Dayco 5060685,"Even though it says it fits the 1998 volvo S70 T5, it does not. The belt is too small by about 2 inches."
4,it's allright,The camera jumps around too much and that's just my humble opinion but all in all a fun to watch concert since I can't afford to see him in real life
5,Required For Any Fan,"If you are a Buffett fan there is no way this dvd does not end up in your collection. Many classic songs, fantastic behind the scenes shots and one of his best encores in the bleachers singing Steve Goodman.One could say more, but that should be enough if you are a fan."
5,Jimmy at his best,"The concert footage from Wrigley Field is great. The feel almost places you right with all the Parrott Heads. I have been to 4 Buffett concerts and he brings it every time. You have to be able to taste the margarita's in your mind, but it's good for the soul. The only problem I have with any of his concerts is he stops playing, always leaving the crowd wanting more. Any true Parrott Head could not turn this one down. I highly recommend this DVD. So buy it and get the 'RITAS ready put on your Hawaiian Shirt and sit back turn off the lights; and maybe you'll feel like your right in the crowd lovin' it all..... wishing it wouldn't end.Parrott Head for life,Jeff"
1,phoned it in,"I am not a parrot head, but do like buffet's music and have heard good things about his live performances. This video is almost unwatchable. He does not seem to be making any effort to make good music. He should watch a springsteen concert to see someone that does care."
5,Just like being there!,"This is absolutely the best video I have seen in a long, long time. If you're a parrothead it is a must have for your collection. Made me smile and sing along the whole time! Jimmy Buffet is absolutely adorable!"
5,The best just got better,"What more could a true Parrotthead ask for than Jimmy Buffett live at Wrigley Field?This two-disc DVD set captures the truly historic concert from Chicago. Jimmy and the band put on a great show. It makes you feel as though you were part of the show.The bonus coverage is not to be miseed. The time lapse of setting up the stage is fun to watch. And the Star-Spangled Banner performance rivals Jimi Hendrix.This is a must for any music lover, but the true Parrottheads will definitely need to add it to their collection."
4,A ParrotHead Must Have,"All true Parrot Heads will want to add this Concert DVD to their collection. It also gives an enjoyable travelogue of the City of Chicago - one of Budda's favorite adopted hometowns.Jimmy even goes behind the grill at the [...] Inn grill. Home to his world favorite Cheeseburger and serves them up to a surprised hungry crowd. How cool of Jimmy.Filmed over a two day period, it is an easy flowing excursion into Parrot Head mania."
1,"""If It Works Leave It Alone""","I bought this DVD out of curiousity. I am a fan of the ""original"" Callanetics and wanted to see if there could be any ""useful"" enhancement of the program. Callanetics was and is a program for toning and strength. Also, it is a great workout!!! Incorporating ""yoga"" and ""aerobics"" is unnecessary and needless for a program that is already complete for your needs. Buy the ""original"" it's worth it, this isn't. ""If it ain't broke don't fixit!"""
2,Not Callan,I just pulled this out again to see if I changed my mind about it. I did not! This workout is not only rather boring (I definitely missed her) it seems to not follow Callan's care about safeguarding knees. Most of the exercises are based on lunges whether or not they are deep ones. I would recommend getting out older Callanetics exercises for great toning (especially the 20 minute targeted ones) and doing some other form of aerobic exercise.
3,Need to explain moves,The DVD is nice and gives a good work out.The problem that I have is that someone unfamiliar with these moves is lost.I had to watch the DVD 4 times before I could do some of the moves.Detailed instructions should have been given for each specific move.
1,BAD video,"I purchased this DVD because I read other reviews that were suggesting this video as an alternative to Tracy Anderson's CArdio.Well, clearly it is not.I was so disappointed. This video is an extremely slow sequence of very simple stretches that , at least in my case, are suitable for relaxation, but honestly is too slow to even minimally raise the pulse.Perhaps if you are beginning an exercise program this is a suitable video, but if you are already exercising, then do not consider this a suitable alternative to cardio, since this is not..."
2,Okay if you are injured,"I found this workout time consuming, boring, and ineffective. If you are serious about burning fat or building muscle, this is not the way to go. If you have not been on an exercise program at all and need something very easy, you might want to try this. I did the Callanetics program back in the day, and now I remember why I quit doing it."
2,Bad cheap copy,Was really interested in this version of Callanetics. Thought it looked professional but the DVD was unreadable. Actually became stuck in my player that I use all the time and have never had a problem with. Wish I could have see the video to judge it but I never got that chance. Don't know that I'll risk ordering it again.
2,Less than expected,"Bought this because of the names of the people involved. Very lethargic playing, very ordinary songs, definitely not what I'd call blues music. If you want a contrast, try the 2009 Mick Fleetwood Band CD Blue Again - this is really how white guys can play the blues well. This CD is a dud."
2,Poor sound quality,"Not only is the sound level very low (I had to turn my volume all the way up and it's still hard to hear) but if the plug twists in the slightest, there are bursts of static and the volume gets even worse. I'm only giving them 2 stars because they MAY be handy to have for travelling, but I would definitely NOT recommend these headphones for everyday use."
4,Great for what they are !,"These are very good inexpensive folding headphones. The sound is pretty good and they have lasted much longer than expected at the hands of my young son. They have outlasted much more expensive headphones which I have purchased for him in the past. Do not expect BOSE or any of the other upmarket headphones quality, but they're a lot better than one would expect for the price paid. I have rated them accordingly, and have just purchased additional pairs as backup as well as a pair for myself!"
3,"Cheap, convenient, but doesn't last forever","These headphones are cheap and have decent sound. They fold up to a size small enough to fit into my pants pocket. They fit comfortably on the head and are not too tight. Since the ear pads do not surround the ear they do not provide any sort of external sound blockage, so are not appropriate in noisy environments. Given that I use them almost every day and that I treat them roughly, they typically last only a few months. Usually the failure is that one ear-pad speaker starts cutting in and out, or fails altogether. However, given that they are cheap and convenient I will continue to buy new ones as they fail.UPDATE (23-March-2012) I have now owned 4 or 5 of these and they seem to be failing even faster than I originally indicated, so I will probably stop buying these and buy something more expensive but, hopefully, more durable."
5,great head phones,"We bought 4 of these head phone for our kids 13, 11, 4 and 3 to go to Europe and they worked great for all of them and did not break. For the money you can not go wrong and if they can hold up to a 4 and 3 yr. boyz, for a month being used everyday I would say they are good. The sound quality seems good as well."
4,light weight great,"Nice little pair of backup headphones. My daughter prefers them to more expensive ones because they don't ""squeeze her head"" ! She was so happy when she found them in her holiday stocking and immediately started using them at the gym. Can't beat the price!!! On an important note, you cannot use this on an IPod that has a plastic case on it. The jack will not push in all the way. Evidently this is a common issue, the old ones that are the same make always worked so this batch must be using a new design. :0( ."
1,Don't waste your money,"You get what you pay for. These were super cheap, and they certainly turned out to be so. Can't hear the music when it's plugged entirely into my ipod and you can't exactly have your headphones partly plugged in while at the gym. Oh well, live and learn."
3,Good sound but it broke too easily,"Sound, comfort and portability are good. One of the earcups broke off. I don't think I'd buy again unless it was $3 or less."
3,A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED,"THE SONG SELECTION WAS AVERAGE. THERE ARE BETTER SONGS TO BEATMIX THAN THIS SELECTION. OR DID POLITICS GET IN THE WAY. IF YOU HAVE HAD GOOD FORTUNE TO BE DRIVEN INTO A FRENZY BY DENNY'S TURNTABLE PRESENCE AT ABYSS OR CARBON,EXIT,TEMPS.ECT.ECT.....THEN YOU WOULD AGREE THIS A LITTLE SUB-PAR FOR HIS CALIBER."
3,Somewhat Bland,"This book is more of a ""tourist"" type book than a good fine-art photography book. With the exception of a few nice photographs, most of the images are rather bland. This book might appeal to someone who's looking for pictures, not just of nature, but of buildings, sporting events, skiers, fishermen, etc. But if you're looking for a book with good photos of the Rocky Mountains and the scenic areas of Colorado, I'd recommend that you look elsewhere. To see the books I recommend, check out my list of ""Best Colorado Picture Books"" (by clicking on my name and then on ""listmania lists"")."
3,Music For Dancing,"We select music that we can dance to, since we teach Ballroom Dancing. We dance West Coast Swing to various songs from this album."
4,Nice!!!!!!!!!!,"Teresa;Just does a mellow job, she is great if you want to really put your attention on her. she will keep i there or if you have company you can bet it won't take long for someone to say , Who the heck is that playing????She will be around for many years to come, Chech her out."
3,The weakest book in a very strong series,"I somewhat agree with Terry Cholar's review, although I wouldn't call myself ""disappointed"". Just ""not as thrilled as I expected to be.""There was a feeling of ""marking time while setting up the next book"". Also, the richness of characterization that I loved from the earlier books was also diminished. Jago, Banichi and Cenedi could have been pretty much any generic Atevi Guild members.If one were actually to list the significant events in the book (which I won't for the sake of those who haven't read it yet), it would be a pretty short list. That said, what little that does occur takes place in the same rich network of intrigue and totally believable clash of cultures that make me love this series.Readers of the first 4 books will probably enjoy Defender. But it may not live up to the expectations caused by the quality of the prior books and many months of waiting for Defender's publication. I can't wait for book 6!"
3,3-star book in a 5-star series,"This is definitely a ""bridge"" book and doesn't have a lot of story on its own. Yes, it has the ""crisis"" that us Foreigner series readers have some to expect but it is much more muted in this book and not that satisfying.With the lack of a strong story on its own, the central ""difficulty in communicating with an alien race"" theme begins to grate a little after 5 books.It seems kind of extreme to say it of a 464 page book, but I think it could almost have been edited down to be the first chapter of the next book in the series. When I see this kind of thing, I always wonder if the publisher is applying pressure to squeeze out that last dollar.Explorer, the next book in the series, is out now in hardback and my expectations are very high that Ms. Cherryh gets the series back to the level of quality we have come to expect."
2,What happened?,"I love Cherryh's books. Hunter of Worlds is still one of my favorites, along with the Mri sagas. I've re-read Foreigner so many times that the binding is wearing loose. (...) Now, after a long wait, and eagerly pre-ordering from Amazon so I would get it as soon as possible, I received Defender. I read it in two days (had to go to work--it arrived on a weekday) and was incredibly disappointed. The human-atevi interface complexities, the growing depth of atevi and human characters revealed in the first three books, the warm humor and stern duty of Jago and Banichi, the wry tyranny of Ilisidi, the intrigues of Tabini and the delicious missteps of a human amid the atevi and their subsequent confoundment at times with a human to whom they owe manchi, are all missing. This book reads like a rough draft instead of the highly polished work Cherryh usually brings, especially to this series of dearly beloved characters."
2,Defender,"This is the fifth book in her ""trilogy"", and the poorest of the series. The author takes forever to develop what turns out to be an elementary plot. She even repeats an approach taken in an earlier novel (involving poison). The author manages to crowd fifty pages of content into 314 pages. Even worse, the space ship barely begins its journey by the end of the novel. I hope that the next novel in the series has more content and less agonizing by the central character - Bren Cameron. If he will spend less time worrying about his disfunctional family, perhaps he can do his job!"
2,non defender,"Cherryh's strength has been her characters, as much as her plots. In the Foreigner universe, she has created some of her strongest.But the latest release, Defender, both plot and characters have received short shrift. In fact, at the end of this short book (it has 314 pages, Precursor had 438), the characters and the situation are almost identical. There is little interaction between Bren and Banichi, Jago, and Ilisidi. With a little editing, this book could have been 2 or 3 chapters of the next book. If you miss this one, don't worry. Nothing happened."
2,Wait for the paperback,"I gave this book 2 stars just because I love this series. However he book alone was not the author's best work. OK, to be honest it is the worst I have ever read from her. The book seemed unfinished and hasty. You could probably skip this one all together and just buy bok #6."
4,Excellent nuts and bolts overview,"I use this as a reference book in my Master's graduate seminar in Political Communication. It's an excellent overview of the practical nuts and bolts of state legislation, pitched at a general enough level that makes it widely applicable. The book's strengths lie in its account of how state legislators are go-betweens (political entrepreneurs, literally) who rely on the specialized knowledge of lobbyists to craft legislative language. The book clearly makes the point that legislators need input, so advocacy groups who may oppose given legislation need to have a clear presence and good arguments to act as their own lobby.The weakness of the book is the limit of its scope. This is not so much a criticism of what the book does, and does well, as it to note that significant ideological division in a state legislature can render the pragmatic orientation of the book moot."
5,Great find in the midst of the 99 hip-hop onslaught!Genius,"Been with the boy for years! This album rocks! Pure and simple. Probably one of the years greatest! Makes me want to go out and swill beer, smoke cigarettes, find loose women and get tattoos! Hard to believe we all grew up so quick - Mike has come a long way from Social D. without losing that edge! ""Hear me talkin hillbilly boy? I ain't through with you by a damn sight."""
5,Required listening,"Fantastic album, one that you will keep in your pile of cd's that you play over and over again without getting sick of."
3,I want to hate it but I keep tappin,"Is it me or do all the songs sound the same? I think Ness should stay with his ""distorted"" music and just keep listening to country. Good concept though. I dont really like this cd but i do find some of the songs bearable."
5,Rock N Roll Roots,"A week ago, if someone had asked me what I though about Mike Ness, I would have said that he is a braindead punk singer from the band Social Distortion. But after hearing this recording, I have a new respect for Ness. In ""Cheating At Solitaire"", he really touches on his 50's rock and country roots. His style on this album is more diverse and pleasing to the ear than anything from Social Distortion. He shows that he is more than just a punk singer, but a rock legend."
3,"It's OK, Not Great","I'm a big fan of Social Distortion, so I was excited to check out this CD. I always liked the rockabilly influences in Social Distortion, but for my taste this one is too rockabilly. Perhaps unfairly, I was looking for more Social Distortion. If you're really into rockabilly, I would have to say that this is an album that you should check out. Also give a listen to Reverend Horton Heat."
2,Basically trivial,"A compulsive exercise in trying to figure out how buildings make sense by conceptualizing forms to their essence. In Harry Potter I believe this is what the Dementors did to their unfortunate victims; take over their bodies and suck out their souls. In retrospect this seems to be Krier's genius if you will; reduce the life,vitality, and history of a building and end up with a spiritless cartoon that is supposed to enlighten...somehow. Two stars because I marvel at how prodigious his obsession was in making this scrapbook come about."
5,Thank you Brenda,This book (and a behaviorist whose work is based in Brenda's protocols) is helping us deal with one of our dogs. This book is a must for behavior issues.
2,Aggression in Dogs: More Like Aggression in Me After Reading,"Just a bit too much info for me. I didn't want a Master's Degree, just some ""practical"" info on how to decrease dog aggression one dog toward another. Seems overwhelming and way too detailed; had to read so much to get up-to-speed on the jargon. Maybe I'm too lazy"
4,Bible for dog training not just aggression,"Author is very knowledgeable about dog behavior. She knows how to firmly but without anger, teach you to appreciate your dogs strengths and weaknesses, and patiently guide him to success. Many anecdotes are used for instruction. Well worth reading."
4,"Folgers Home Cafe Coffee Pods, 100% Colombian, 18-Count Packages (Pack of 6)","I am enjoying the Folgers Home Cafe Coffee Pods. The coffee is delicious.They are hard to come by in my local grocery. The price is cheaper than Senseo Pods even with the shipping costs.My only complaint is the delivery time. Waiting for coffee when you are running low is anxiety producing. No, I don't want to pay extra for quicker shipping.I would recommend this product."
1,"no sir, I don't like it","A ""little rough"" on the taste is putting it mildly. I've tried mixing this product a number of ways and every time, the taste makes me gag and I can never finish the whole shake.Which is a shame, since I rather have my vitamins in powder form and the price seemed really good compared to greens+ and other green powder vitamins. I just can't get past the taste on this.If you have tastebuds of steel, go for it but I recommend getting the smaller quantity first to make sure you can handle the taste."
4,Finally!,"I have been looking for years for a Christmas movie I only saw once. I was so impressed with it, I have never forgotten it. Finally, I found it on Amazon and was able to purchase it. I am very happy to finally be able to add it to my collection of Christmas movies."
3,BE CERTAIN YOU GET THE PATTERNS W/BOOK!,"I just bought a used copy of this book through Amazon that did not include the tissue patterns. Without the patterns, the book is useless! The 3 patterns consist of a raglan top, elastic waist pants and a box type shirt. You vary the patterns length, trim, and sleeves to create the different outfits."
4,Love Giant Robot Models,I have been collecting Gundam models for some time I have over 60 assembled and several more kits to put together. While I love the design of the Gundam XM-X1 Crossbone it is a little hard to keep standing. I have a display case where I showcase some of my favorite Gundams and I wanted to add this one. Now that it is complete I'll have to modify so I can put in my display case. Other than that I love the model and it arrived in excellent condition so I am will be looking to purchase from this retailer again.
1,Shady company,"I purchased these sports bra because the racer back looks nice. A day or two after I ordered the product, the company sent me an email telling me that this item is on back order and I'll get it when they got new ones in. I wasn't in a hurry to get these bras, so I agreed to wait.Fast Forward to two months later, I received these items from the mail, completely different then the ones in the picture!!! I ordered 2 small sized racer back bras, and what I got was large half shirt... the bra's so big, that it goes half way down to my stomach, it's not even racer back, looked nothing like it does in the picture. I sent another email to complain, and never heard back from the company.the bras are still sitting in my closet, maybe I'll use it to mop the floors eventually."
2,Very thin!,Very thin and lacking support. I dont need much support at all so that is saying something. I returned the bra.
5,Great for high impact!,"This bra is great for women with smaller breasts. It is the first bra I have found in years that offers enough support without a huge, heavy, too-tight band around the wrong part of the ribcage. The straps don't put too much pressure on neck or shoulders, and the fabric breathes well. I own two, and hope to be able to buy more!"
2,TOO delicate,The inner circle from the rubber plate is very delicate. After a only a week it started to bend causing it to make noise.
5,Shows how to achieve victory over the hardest sins.,One of the most influencial books I have ever read. I have given copies to many people. The Lord has used this book to show me the power of the Spirit in my everyday struggles. It has definitely changed my life. I have found freedom from some life-long battles and have discovered that God never intended me to win them in the first place. VERY practical - you can use the concepts while you are reading it. A short powerful book.
2,get the original (messages on the victorious life),"A not so good version of the most AMAZING book EVER!....except the BIble... I got it thinking it was the original and was very disappointed and ended up ordering the right one right after. It's made all commercial and a lot of the good stuff from the original book is left out and some crap is added that takes away from the beautiful message...in my opinion...Get the real version! ""Victory in Christ- Messages on the Victorious Life"" Trumbull. It is a humble pink paperback book and it has made the grace and freedom we have in Christ more real to me than any book besides the Bible that I have read. God bless!"
3,Not worth the money for fun,I recently brought this product for my youngest daughter. It was a piece of junk. The swing does not keep the doll in and the high chair comes apart. I then return and brought the one with the bassenet and that was even worst. The only thing it taught my daughter was that it is ok to become frustated and try try again if you dont succeed the first time.
3,good gift,"Set came with everything listed, but the swing has some technical difficulties. The posts don't lock, so they tend to come apart and have to be snapped back in place often. Other than that, the set as a whole is enjoyable for my 6 year old daughter. She has really had a good time with it."
1,unhappy with purchase,This stroller set is cute but looks aren't everything. My almost 2 yr old and 6 yr old broke the swing the first day they had it. Of course they were fighting over it when it happened. Still the quality of all 3 products are not worth the price of $29.99. If they brought the price down to $19.99 I still would not recommend it.
5,KISS,"Another great instilation of the Kissology!!If you have the other two previous ones,this one is a must have!!Great footage!A must have for Kiss fans of everyone!Shows you why that Kiss is still the Hottest Band in the world,and when you want the best,Kiss gives you their best!!"
3,A bit disappointed,"I love Kiss...lets get that straight. My only disappointment with the Kissology series is that it doesn't cover the eighties enough. The non-makeup era was some of their best music and they breezed through it. The Animalize era concerts were some of the best. This third edition leaves something to be desired.Are they going to make another edition? Why didn't they add the concert where it was just Gene, Tommy, and Eric? That was historic for Kiss to be a trio. Why didn't they cover stuff with Tommy?I love the concert at the Coventry in 1973, but I was left wanting more."
1,KISS OFF GENE AND PAUL!,"I haven't even viewed any of the DVDs and I'm already really dissapointed;why do Paul and Gene choose the final DVD set to publicly air their dirty laundry towards Ace and Peter?! Very unprofessional if you ask me.Paul completely bad-mouths Peter in the book (a miserable clown) and Genesays the whole Reunion era was torture every single moment. I'm sure the reason Peter and Ace WERE miserable was because Gene and Paul are miserable people to work for! I'd like to hear Peter and Aces side of the story...KISS will always be one of my favorite bands but to hear these guys bad-mouth each other really leaves a bad taste in the fan's mouths.And their explanation of how the Farewell tour wasn't really the end is a joke; PULL THE PLUG GENE AND PAUL AND STOP DRESSING IMPOSTERS IN PETERS AND ACES COSTUMES! I'm ready to apply for an honorable discharge from the KISS ARMY! :-ZSincerely,Johnny Bravo"
2,Anyway you slice it...,"No matter what order, what clarity, which concerts you include or don't include... these years sucked. Completely. There I said it. Just as the years 86-91 had. My favorite years, the previous set; Vol. 2 was handled ham-handedly however no mangling could destroy the performances of the Elder Fridays special.. those were the years to be on board; '78-82, anything after is filler, fluff, fudge, farce, and folly. Yes I love Kiss deeply, but this isn't Kiss it's Kill... as in dead already."
1,Detroit Rock City-less???,"Having attended the kick-off show in Detroit June 28th, 1996, I have waited long and patiently; more than 10 years, for this show to come out on DVD. Imagine my disappointment to see the set list had been cut... But not just any song...but DETROIT ROCK CITY???? who was the genius that decided to cut the best Kiss song ever from the show in the city whose name it bears??? What a F@#%ing joke!!! Probably the dumbest thing I've ever seen... Musically/DVD speaking. Gene, you screwed up on this one..."
3,The least of 3.,"I loved volume 1 and I couldn't wait for vulume 2. They are both better than this final edition. Don't get me wrong, it's good, and I like seeing this part of the timeline but, it lacks the punch of the first two in the series. A must have to complete the collection but you don't get as much cool history and interviews. Still fun."
5,KISS RULES!,"I could go on and on about how awesome KISS is. But, with that said, KISS is the greatest R & R band of all time and this DVD proves it!"
4,Detroit '92,"""With the majority of Detroit '92 (GREAT show) and Detroit '96 (rough show on all counts, notably the band's peroformance and how the show is presented on the disc - clearly video footage for the giant screens at the stadium, it doesn't work very well as a home video release"").This is the one that I could not understand because the video was choppy at best and did not look consitant even after not viewing it for a long time so is that the onlt video that was available from that show because it looks robotic looking and only shows closeups through almost the entire show. Not very professional looking. Parts looked like they were bored and Peter had one scene where he looked miserable as if he was just going through the motions."
2,OUT OF ORDER,"This is out of chronoligical order--they--all four original members--perform on disc 2 in make up before the unplugged series is shown, which happened before the live make up performance, which inticed them to come together and put the make up bac kon and make it work again, which was the whole reason."
5,kiss,I own all three kissologys this is by far the best I personally like the unplugged concert the best I hope there is more kissologys in the future
5,Kissology 3,"Merry Kissmas everyone. I too was hoping that the Tiger Stadium show would be similar to the ""Shout it out loud"" video that is from that concert. Be that as it may, it is a great deal for $22.99. I would have paid that amount for Unplugged alone. Sure there are better shows, better recordings, better tours...but for the money you can't beat it. What other band is putting out stuff like this. Maybe they will take a hint from KISS and put out some Van Halen, Black Sabbath, Cheap Trick, Aerosmith, etc.... I thing we would have the right to complain if it was more money. Remember how excited we were when we saw little snippets on the other KISS DVD releases like KISS Konfidential and KISS my A$$. Here we are getting a lot for our dollar. Bottom line, Buy it, Play it, Enjoy it, Relive the memories!!"
5,SIMPLE BUT POWERFUL!,One of the simplist but most powerful books that i have ever read! We've all used this technique & seen it in use but few of us recognise it for what it is!
2,I knew that... Who doesn't know that?,"I once read that the greatest secret to success is knowing what you want, know what it will cosy, and be willing to pay that price. I was given this book as a gift, from someone who purchased for 25 cents at a tag sale. Honestly, had I or anyone paid full price for this book, I would really be upset. As it was, 25 cents was just about a fare price.After reading the book, I wonder if those positive reviews are because people really didn't know this common sense idea? Could it be that no one wants to admit they actually paid for a book that pretty much points out the obvious?My hat is off to the author for coming up with such a creative title. I would think that anyone who is not happy with their current situation would jump at this book.The real Ultimate Secret is that you already know this, and you haven't taken action and put it to use.Hey, I could have had a V8..."
5,This is no book - THIS IS A MIRACLE!,"Jeff Vanvonderan does it again. His wisdom, written with a ""probe like"" dialogue into your heart, helps the reader better understand his or her hurt, and therefore overcome it. Even for readers who have not found themselves hurt by ignorant, but certainly well meaning, people, this book is strongly recommended. It will prepare you with the tools to handle the hurts that come your way. (This book actually lifted me out of a critical, very clinically advanced depression.)"
5,The Rose Rent by Ellis Peters,"It was an extravagance to buy an original copy of this novel for over NZ$40 to replace one that had gone missing from my shelf, but as I get so many ebooks free from Amazon I don't mind for this once. When books are out of print they become very valuable. I am amazed that the publishers would allow such a great series as the Cadfael stories to be lost. Shrewsbury is on the tourist map because of them.To balance that I have discovered that some enlightened person has made available 'The (almost) Complete Works of George MacDonald', Scotland's famous storyteller to download on Kindle. I found this when looking through children's fiction. I was overjoyed as it is impossible to buy them anymore. They should be listed under adult fiction as well as mostly they are not for children, but I am not complaining as I am so delighted to have access to them.Well done Amazon and Thank You!!"
4,More than a mystery novel,"Brother Cadfael is one of those people who seems to exist out of time. He's smart, sensitive and quite a liberal little priest. He shines in this mystery. And though most of the mysteries in the series are easy to figure out, the pleasure comes as much from where the narrative takes you as from figuring out ""whodunit"" before the last chapter. Go ahead, you want to read it. You know you do."
5,A brilliant piece of historical fiction.,"Ellis Peters is not only a great writer but was first a historian, and that knowledge shows through in her writing. I was enterested to see how acurate her descriptions of the early/mid part of the second century was that I did a little research of my own and she is right on. I enjoyed ""The Rose Rent"" so much that it is now packed in my bag that I will take to the hospital when I deliver my baby."
5,A sweet and interesting mystery,"One of Ellis Peter's best, this is the sweetest of her mysteries. It is also one of her most complicated. The herbalist-brother must work hard to solve both the puzzle and the lives of the characters touched by the story."
2,Not Durable & Somewhat Uncomfortable,"This is a fairly cheap product that isn't worth $100. It is poorly engineered and mine started falling apart on the 2nd use. You can get a very good workout with this type of product but I'd recommend the real BOSU ball. First of all, the Body Dome is NOT designed for use on both sides. You can only use the dome side. Second of all, the nipples all over the dome will make your feet sore if you exercise barefooted (which is my preference when I'm doing balance work). The videos are a nice feature (3 different 10 minute videos) but they are just an intro and nothing too serious. Just get the BOSU and buy some videos separately is my advice."
3,"Good product, not ""fairly cheap""","I didn't understand Kennon's review. I read his review of a ""real"" BOSU ball and he was very happy with that. He mentioned there that he had trouble inflating the ball. I had trouble too, until I inserted the inflation needle all the way. Then the air went in easily.Kennon said it started falling apart on the 2nd use. I wish he had described what broke because the ball easily holds me at 197 lbs and looks well engineered. The exercise bands were a nice feature, first they are very handy, second, the bands help beginners with balance. Three stars because a $200 BOSU (exercise videos not included) is better."
4,Bosu Ball,"I received the bosu ball very quickly. The ball met my expectations; however, the pump and needle were inadequate for that equipment. I had to buy another needle and use a bicycle pump."
3,"A good book, but perpetuating the myths.","This is a fun book to read, but inaccurate, despite the best intentions of one of the authors.The more accurate biography of Bix is that by Phil and Linda Evans, which has a wealth of information and photography not included in this book by Evans and Sudhalter, and has been carefully compiled to have only facts, not anecdotal myths."
5,Great Service!,I received the order very promptly and the merchandise was exactly as described--perhaps better. I am thrilled to have such a sturdy copy of this book!
5,Ras Midas is a wise man,"I knew Ras Midas in California, when he use to come by my husband and my roots shop. He always was a thoughtful man with a vast wealth of knowledge. He had given me this tape in the 80's, and I am so glad to see he has it on CD. I am definitely going to get this and his other works, and am so pleased he has continued in his musical career. He has a very strong message to send, with realism and positivity!Thanks Ras Midas! -Sula"
4,"Patience, and you will find something very beautiful","I very nearly threw this book in the heap half way through. This is not ""crime fiction"" as we know it. And the ""crime"" is strangely obscure and not the centre of the plot. I was losing patience and couldn't understand what the point was; yet I'd already gone halfway. However, the next day I came back, enticed by the exquisite and poetic language and oddly troubled to leave this puzzling book and its characters hanging unfinished. As I reached the end, slowly and quietly everything becomes clear. The reward is something very beautiful, I think, and very touching.I look forward to reading more by this author, however, I really think ""mystery fiction"" is not the correct label and will only lead to some readers being very frustrated."
1,Just never hooked me.,"I struggled to get interested in this book but finally gave up after 38 pages. I did not read the first Father Anselm book and maybe that would have helped carry over some interest in the characters. Maybe not. As a first time Broderick's reader, I find his writing style incredibly boring. What details or descriptive writing there was seemed only an effort to lengthen the book and not necessarily to be evocative of any mood or conjure vivid images in my imagination. I did not make it far enough to really comment on the craft of the mystery story itself. Perhaps a true mystery lover would have the patience to get through to the meat of the tale. Time to go back to Poe, Conrad, Hawthorne, King, or Chabon."
1,Extraordinarily Disappointing,"I found the narrative unintelligible and loosely threaded-together. I take pride in finishing EVERY book I read, no matter how terrible I find the prose. To confess to neither wanting nor being able to finish this work speaks volumes to its deficiencies. I continually turned the pages hoping the next would be better than the last and some cohesion would take shape. None ever did."
2,OK for the city,Don't waste your money on this product!I was hoping this software would assist me in finding my way around the logging roads of Nova Scotia during my summer months there. MapSend has no detail of back roads and only useful if you travel main highways. One of the few lakes outlined in Nova Scotia is mis-named which caused me a little confusion until I realized the shortcomings of this product.
3,Best Humping Dog USB,"It's fun to plug in to someone's laptop who hasn't seen it. The plug is too short and it won't fit a lot of USB ports that are recessed, like on the side of a Dell."
2,Funny once,I saw this toy on a show and it didn't have the sounds from it. This thing is funny but so loud. You can't leave it plugged in for more than a second because of the sound.
1,A Horrible Product of Low Quality,"The product was faulty. When plugged in, it caused my computer to malfunction. Also, when contacting the vendor, he was rude and refused to give me a refund.Horrible and unprofessional."
4,If for nothing else,"Just a note, as others have written pretty accurate ""this is good, but a bit rambling"" type reviews.IF FOR NO OTHER REASON, If for nothing else, this is worth getting (or any version of OVO) for the one song: Father, Son. If you're a son who loves (and in my case misses) his father, and you cannot cry during this song, then I cry for you. It is absolutely the essential Peter Gabriel at his very best.Thanks for listening to a 57 year old boy who still really misses has dad, and thank you Peter Gabriel for your inconsistencies, as they are what makes plain music good, and makes you PG!"
2,He can do better,"Although I have the best of respects for Peter Gabriel, and admire his contribution for music, I believe this was defenitely NOT one of his best albums. I do listen his records very often, but I've listen the OVO rarely. I am aware that he blended many different types of music, but sinceerely I think, he lacked of the original touch he prints in every other of his recordings.It seems like a patchwork that lacks of coherence. Peter Gabriel is a progressist, music genius but Ill have to wait for him to demonstrate it on his next album."
5,Amazing Record,"Probably one of the best records ever made by Peter Gabriel. This is one of those records that all the Peter Gabriel fans must have. The presence of Alison Goldfrap in ""The time of the turning"" is fantastic. Once you listen for the first time you just won't be able to stop listening. All the musics are beautiful specially ""4 - The time of the turning(Reprise)/The weavers reel""; ""9 - Downside-Up"" and ""12 - Make tomorrow""."
1,"SNORE....Peter, what happened?","I'm afraid this CD doesn't warrant more than one star, mostly due to the fact that it's just plain BORRRRRRING! I have a version with the rap ""Story of OVO"", which is by far the worst written and worst performed rap of all time. The rest of the CD is just elevator Muzak, though done in PG-style, which is to say with sitars and African drums and whispery singers. I like Garbriel's music but this is pretty average stuff."
4,2nit4 hours,It's okay. I liked the CTU unit set-up much better. You can tell that season 8 would be the final season.....nothing left to the imagination.
4,Keifer Does it again!,Great DVD and I received very fast and had no problem ordering.I love 24 and I love ordering here because it is easy and very fast.
3,No on Blu Ray,"My comment is not about the show, I love it, have all 8 seasons. I think you wouldbetter off to buy the regular DVD, than the Blu Ray. The blacks, during the nightscenes, especially outside, look terrible. All kinds of little red pixels in thepicture. Some of the dark interior shots look almost as bad. Am watching on anew Sony Bravia XBR, with a new Sony 3d rated DVD player, so don't think it'sthe equipment, just poor quality control. So save money, and buy regular DVD.Just my opinion."
5,24,"We sad with this series ending, Sutherland captures your attention from the moment it starts to the very end. I wished this series would have continued. We have watched the entire 8 seasons several times. Action packed."
1,Bad Quality Blu-Ray - 24: Season Eight,"I am writing this review because the Blu-ray 24: Season Eight set that I received is defective, but I didn't try to use is until after Amazon's 90-day return policy limit, therefore, I guess I have no recourse. I paid $61.95 for the set. This is very frustrating. There apparently is no way to contact Amazon regarding this matter. I ordered it as a Christmas gift for my husband. He didn't open it until a few days ago and the first disk could not read! The second one did, but without the first disk, 6 hours of the season is missing. Apparently because Amazon has a 90 day return policy and we are beyond the 90 days we have no recourse. If someone can tell how to reach Amazon with comments, I would appreciate it."
4,Good bounce back after Season 6,"Season 6 was a disaster for 24 fans, Season 7 is a good bounce back after the writers strike. Great for 24 fans."
4,24 Best Suspense Thriller Ever!,I love this show! Best Suspense Thriller Ever! I'm presently going through 24 withdrawl and I'm watching the series on DVD all over again. My only criticism of the season eight DVD is that I would have liked more interviews with the cast (past and present); better extras. That's the reason I gave this 4 stars.
5,"24 - The last season, #8",Fast shipment. Prices comparable with Cost Co.It was a Christmas present for my son. He said it is very good and he will loan it to me when he is done watching it.Thank you.
4,"Reviewing ""24"".",We have all eight seasons and found this to be a great series compared to a lot of the programs on TV these days. A lot of great entertainment for the money. Season 8 on Amazon was $19:99 plus shipping as compared to Walmart and a couple of other stores at $32:99 and $45:99.
5,24 Forever,"This was a really good way to watch 24, and we watched it in about 5 days. The quality of this DVD set was excellent, and the story was pure Jack. We enjoyed watching the entire series this way and highly recommend that everyone watches it on DVD>"
2,Major quality issues,"I dont usually write reviews for Amazon.com but in this case I feel I have to. I didnt give the product 2 stars for its content. Id give the content 3 out of 5 Wasnt the best season by any stretch of the imagination and Jack Bauer deserved a GREAT season.It did have a feww moments...Anyways back to the reason im writing this review..I oroignially odered this about a month ago direct from Amazon.com...and there was major scratches on disc 2 which was unplayable..OK i simply sent it back for a replacement..My replacement arrives and theres a Glue substance all over the edges of Disc 1..I was able to clean it off for the player to read..Anyways I was half way through the season and Disc 4 skips...WITH NO SCRATCHES OR SMUDGES WHATSOEVER...I am now on my THIRD copy in less than a month..If this one is damaged or doesnt work, im just getting a refund"
5,24: The Complete Eighth Season,"I'm a huge fan of 24 and have collected all 8 seasons of these excited action pack videos. These videos will have you glued in position because you just can't walk away from 24, neither do you want to put it on pause. The excitement in what will happen next will always have you focused. Love it, love it, love it......I can't wait for the movie."
2,Disc tend to skip,Some of the episodes skip during play or completely freeze. Would have returned if I had opened and used sooner then I did.
5,Great all the way to the end!,"I was heartbroken when 24 went off the air. I knew it had to happen sometime, but it didn't make it any easier. This season was definitely great - I don't know why others didn't like it as much as I did, but I have watched the entire series again since 2010 and I was not disappointed. The very last few minutes makes me cry every time!Jack Bauer at his best, all the time. Loved it!"
4,"Good episode, BUT REALLY?!?","Ok, yeah. I mean I know the body count for 24 is off the charts, but at this point, with less than a full day-shift to go, it's like they have to kill off someone important EVERY HOUR. What, was payroll getting out of hand?This is a nail-biter episode (well, aren't they all?), but after the previous hour, the ending of this one made me yell, ""SERIOUSLY?!? Can this man not catch a &%$#@ BREAK, already?""I'm a little ticked off at this plot devolvement. And no, I don't mean development. I mean devolvement."
3,Hastings can hasten away,"The character of Hastings, director of CTU...ugh. Boring and...I dunno ...UNDER acted? He says every line in ~exactly~ the same way."
3,"Dana, Schmana","The whole sub-plot of Dana's ex blackmailing her has nothing to do with the main story. I *have* to find out what happens to Jack, but at this point, I am skipping through The Dana & Cole Show portions. I miss Ricky Schroeder, Freddie Prinze Jr is okay and all, but I juuust don't give a NYC rat's azz about his character.The President Hassan guy has THE BIGGEST HAIR IN THE WORLD! Like, distractingly big; when he's on screen, all I can do is stare at his GIANT HAIR, and think, ""dafuk?"" Hassan's Hair should have it's own billing."
4,...hard-fought and near the end...,"""I hate this place."" --Jack BauerAt this point, I already want Jack to get on the damn plane and be done with it. Which says something about the way this series is. JACK just wants to get the hell outta Dodge himself but feels compelled, as always, to stay and save the world.As the viewer, I feel the same way. ""Run, Jack! Get OUT!"" But we know he can't. I feel compelled to stick with him and see it through, thinking, ""By God, eventually SOMETHING has to go right for this guy!"" I'm going to be biting my nails until the end.Jack rocks."
3,"Jack Bauer-24 Fan, ""its complicated""","There are a few characters, actors and storylines to dislike about the final season of 24.""Its complicated"" as Jack would always say but ""the bottom line"" is:If you are a loyal fan of Jack Bauer-24, just like me, you would want to see it through until that last moment.So, I completed my DVD collection of Jack Bauer-24"
5,24 8th Season,100% pleased - it is exciting and of high quality. The service from Amazon was first class. My only dissapointment is that this is the final season of 24.
5,"24 - Season 8 from Amazon, and all other seasons","I have purchased all 8 seasons of ""24"" and love them all. I have passed them around and we now have a ""24"" Club made up of all ages from a mature 13 yr old girl to a gentleman in his 80s!! I don't usually re-watch or re-read books, but I had to make an exception to my own rule! (I did that for all of Vince Flynn's books as well, all available at Amazon.) Can't wait for a ""24"" movie, hopefully Jack Bauer will be played only by Keifer Sutherland - if his body can stand the stress over again! Oh, yes, and Mary Lynn Rajskub as Chloe!"
4,24: The Complete Eighth season,"The final season of 24 rates 4 stars out of 5. This is a great finish to seven of season of a great body of work. If you are a fan of 24, the final season is a home-run."
3,Good show but...,the terrorist tactics used by Jack kinda get annoying. He's supposed to be a good guy. He's fighting these terrorists when he IS a terrorist! Stand back Gestapo there's a new sheriff in town!
2,"Great, while it lasted...","Some things end, not with a bang but with a whimper. Unfortunately, this series is one of them. It is not enough to have fast paced action on the screen. It has to have some degree of ""possible"". Whoever scripted the imbecilic characters here did not take into consideration that there might be a few people watching this who expect a minimum of forensics, a minor understanding of police work and a few details about how firearms work in the real world. ""Willing suspension of disbelief?"" You have to be kidding me!"
1,"If the ""Alamo"" took as long to fight as to read.","If the Battle of the Alamo had taken as long to fight as it was to ""read"", the outcome could have been completely different. After suffering from headaches, hysteria & historical overload in iambic pentameter, surely, the ""Anglo boys"" (Crockett, Travis, etc.) could have won in order to save future generations the humiliation of reading ""history"" in prozac prose"
5,LOVED IT!,"The tape was good. As usual, Howie was entertaining. Always glad to see Howie. Have to provide 6 more words."
2,Howie Mandell...eh.,"The beginning is kinda funny, but then you soon realize that this was very early material. Not to mention a very ""green"" Howie Mandell. The only reason I bought it was to get free shipping, which was about the same cost as the DVD. So no loss for me, but it might be for someone else."
1,Watch out!,"If you saw the commercial show Howie had on TV a few years ago and liked it, you will likely be very disappointed in this DVD. He was evidently censored heavily because this performace is very disappointing and full of vulgar refrences and language. Don't waste your money or time."
2,with some changes could be a lot better,"This massager had some good features but I returned it mainly because of the automatic programs on the massager. Just when the massager would feel like it was doing it's job, the program would go on to another mode. Very jumpy. A good point is there are many choices of sensations that are not automatic programs, but for me, most of them felt like ""almost but not quite"". I think the housing of the unit would not last very long; it felt a bit flimsy. So with some sturdier construction and some control of the sensations of the automatic program; this could be a great massager. I had a massager for over ten years I recently threw away because the cord was coming loose. If I knew I couldn't buy a replacement, I would have had the cord repaired."
3,"""ITS VERY LOUD""","If you like hard pressure applied to you muscle, then you will like this massage. Although it makes allot of noice and rattles. I used it two days in a row on my neck and I couldn't move my neck for a day. But overall I do like the deep muscle pressure but not the noise."
2,What happened Panasonic?,It's hard to believe the same company that made the awesome Panasonic ev278w massager made this thing fifteen years later. This is the replacement. It's just a sad shadow of the 1995 product which I still use and it can get the pressure points in ways this thing can't. The heads and power just are too broad and too weak. I think maybe(?) the ev278w massager was too powerful and they have down powered the thing to this level for legal reasons??? It's just not enough if you know what it use to be. This one is the only one in the Panasonic arsenal that compares at all with the ev278w. My old one is starting to rattle after 15 years of use. It's like seeing a faithful dog die a little with each rattle. THAT was a foot massager for 35 dollars. This one is like a little gnat tapping on your foot.
2,Panasonic EV2610K Easy Reach Massager,Panasonic who used to be the top hand massager definitely lacks expertise to improve their product after all of these years. It is very disappointing that this large company have produced such an inferior product I had to return it.I will have to locate the old Panasonic Massager I bought years past to satisfy my personal care.
2,disappointing,"For years I had been using a Panasonic Reach Easy model EV236 and found it very effective for legs and shoulder. When it finally wore out, I tried to find a replacement and it apparently is a discontinued item.So I ordered the EV2610K Easy Reach Dual Chopper Hand-Held Massager, thinking maybe it's even a better idea.How disappointed I am to find it hard to use -- bulky, noisy and it doesn't reach easy like the older model I've enjoyed for years.Also, when you put it on one setting that does seem the best, all of a sudden it will change to another choppy setting. Very annoying!Panasonic, please bring back the older design. It worked!!"
1,This is terrible,"That this is called a massage is an outrage.We bought it as a gift, especially for the trapezoid area - thinking its curved design would be a good choice. I've seen more power touching a dead battery to my tongue.Seriously, this thing should be recalled. At the VERY HIGHEST SETTING, it barely tickles. I thought for the price tag, I'd be sure to be getting my teeth rattled at the high settings...but no such luck, worst it was a gift and had to be delayed/returned...AND the seller never picks up the phone.Bad, bad, bad...horrible. I think I could make a better unit out of a few water-logged branches and an old radio shack DC current."
1,Save your money,"Should have tossed it in the garbage instead of the garage .. better yet, should have returned it. If you are hurting and need a massager, look beyond this thing. Seems like a good idea, but this dumb thing flops around like a fish out of water and you can't apply pressure anywhere, let alone where you need it. Keep looking, save your money."
1,Excessively loud to relax and sooth muscles after being pounded by massager.,"I had several people give opinions on massager, all agreed made too much noise, especially on neck and shoulders closest to ears for which I purchased this product, very disappointed with preformance also. Felt forceful pounding on sore muscles only added to the spasms, tightness, knots in muscles and increased pain. After a fair trial it now sits in it's box unused.Needless to say I am very disappointed."
2,Disappointed,I ordered this as a replacement for an earlier model by Panasonic. It did not give a comfortable massage and was not comfortable to hold. It was returned.
1,"Hate this heavy, awkward thing","I bought this because the older version was no longer on the market. But it's very different. Much heavier, and more for spot treatment than over all massaging.I used to use the old one on my arthritic joints - palms of my hands, feet, everything. The vibration would bring a nice blood flow to the area that really helped my joints and would only take a few minutes.This one is so heavy and unbalanced and awkward, it hurts my hands to try to hold and maneuver it. I don't use it. It's so different from the earlier version. I wish they'd bring the old one back, and people could just buy whichever one they wanted."
1,Very Disapointed,"My 20 year old cordless Panosonic massager finally gave out and with no parts available for that model I needed a replacement. This seemed the same type of design as my old one but as I found out they are like night and day. The old one used quality plastic that is still perfect but this one is cheap in every way. The worst part are the programed controls, they seemed designed to anoy you rather than give you relief. The type of action the head delivers is very strange compared to my old Panasonic. I would suggest someone in need of a massager try a few to see what works for you."
3,A little disappointed,"I was a little disappointed in this product because I wanted more of a messarger than a pounding. Although this is very comfortable to use, I perfer a much smoother, relaxing movement."
2,Not sure,I can't make a review I don't remember buying this massager. Maybe my husband did but I've not seen it.
1,really loud and basically useless,"Like the previous review, I found this to be way to loud. Total waste of money as it is too loud to stand using and also is to powerful for really sore muscles. Definitely don't bother with it and find a different massager with good reviews."
3,"Yes it works, bottle is more economical","Yes, this product performs well, but the spray can is wasteful and uses propellants. You can buy this same product for less in liquid form. It goes a LOT farther, takes less room and you can apply it accurately exactly where it is needed. For ferrous metals, especially those with large flat surfaces (like table-saws) this is a convenient and good product. Most hand-tools ( which are stored in boxes and drawers) are protected just as well with cheaper and safer products like camphor, silica packs, camellia oil and wax. Some of my father's tools are over a century old and still look like new with these simple products. I am not knocking the T-9 product here; just reminding everyone that there are alternatives that do not use volatile chemicals, propellants or pressurized cans."
5,Excellent product.,"T-9 Boeshield is an excellent product for protecting and storing metal, including firearms and machinery without the worry of rust problems. If you live in an area where you have moisture year round, this is the product for you."
4,up-date on previous review request,"I reviewed this item for you several weeks ago. Said it was too small for my needs and felt the description of the item was not accurate. Have since been contacted by the vendor and they offered to sell me a larger boat, at cost + shipping. This is something they did not need to do and I was more than pleased to accept their offer. Sold me on their customer care services and highly recommend them."
4,PRETTY SWEET!!! just a bit dificult to install,The e-trigger is pretty sweet! has 5 fire modes which you really only need one mode turbo + (rampage). it double the speed of you trigger pulls which makes it where you can shoot up to 23 bps easly. In my opinon once you get the e-trigger you'll LOVE your tippmann 100 times better! Once advise is you will need to get the cyclone feeder also which it works perfect together; i gave it a 4 star b/c the install instuction was WACK! advise to look up on the internet or get it install properly at your local paint supply for around $10
4,E trigger works good,I highly recommend this for any1 with a tippy.. Preferably an A.C.T tippy cuz it definitely chops paint on my tippy but that's only cuz mines is a non A.C.T... But other than that it works great and it's easy to install.. But please ensure you get an electronic hopper that can keep up with you e trigger
5,The Best Kirk Douglas ever did,I waited a few years for this DVD to come out and it was worth it. Not a big movie or a blockbuster but still dear to my heart. Thanks Amazon!
5,Greatest Movie Ever Made!,"Review title says it all. Great theme, great acting, great story, great camera work, fantastic ending. The cowboy is a modern day Quinten Durwood."
5,Only the title is less than outstanding,"The fight between the one armed man and Douglas is one of the best fight sequences I've seen. The movie is in black and white which actually seems to add to its effectiveness. Carroll O'Connor in an early role is outstanding as the truck driver that Douglas's fate is bound to. The real scene stealer, of course, is the horse.This is the quintessential Douglas. Tough, funny, and vulnerable. A great western, among the best I've seen."
5,Excellent Film,"A wonderful film that holds your attention through out.Always been one of my top ten westons, a must to own if you are a cowboy at heart, Even though it is a moden weston it has Old weston values. The Soundtrack is another must to own."
5,Top Ten Greatest Westerns Includes This One,"One of my favorite movies of all time, this poignant story of a man out of touch with today's America is as relevant now as it was when it was filmed.Kirk Douglas has always had his finger on the pulse of the nation, no more than when he enlisted the talents of, and used the name of, Dalton Trumbo, a great writer, blacklist or not.Hat's off to Douglas and to this, his finest performance."
5,One Saturday afternon,"One Staurday afternoon my brother and I stumbled on this film at the local theater. Double feature, the other with Glen Ford was good, but Lonely are the Brave was the absolute winner. To this day I can recall many scenes vividly. One powerful movie indeed. Black and white film photography at it's best"
5,Must-see film.,"Great movies have the capacity to touch minds and change lives. This is one such film. Yet numerous viewers will dismiss it for any number of reasons: that it is not a ""true"" western, that the symbolism is overly obvious, that it's in black and white, that it's depressing. I suspect the criticism many have of the film is actually a testimony to the film's power to move audiences. But because it doesn't provide the expected, virtually required, formulaic Hollywood happy ending, viewers feel compelled to rationalize their disappointment into a denial of the film.Combine Thomas Hardy's poem ""Convergence of the Twain"" with William Blake's criticism of modern industrial life in ""London"" and insert a story about the ""last American cowboy,"" a rugged individualist in an imprisoning social order. The result is a great film--to those who are brave enough to absorb its meanings and willing to remain alone in their estimate."
5,Douglas At his best,"At last we are able to see a DVD of Lonely Are The Brave - It's been a long time coming. As a long time fan of Kirk Douglas, I'm divided over what constitutes his best work. The most ardent of fans would have to say that Douglas scored some stinkers in his time. But most would agree that he more than held his own with his peers of the 50's, 60's & 70's, e.g. Stewart, Wayne, Fonda, Heston etc and at times surpassed them. It's generally held that Kirk's best work encompasses such films as Champion, Paths Of Glory, Lust For Life, Spartacus, Seven Days In May and Lonely Are The Brave. The latter is all the more remarkable because it was made on a shoestring budget, was filmed in black & white and introduced us to some future acting luminaries such as Gena Rowlands, Walter Matthau & George Kennedy, along with the musical genius of Jerry Goldsmith. If Lonely Are The Brave is not Douglas's best work, it certainly comes close. For me 5 stars, without a doubt."
4,Conclusion to Becca's story,"In the conclusion to her story about Becca of Wiserways, Ms. Freisner made a choppier book than the first one. The city, which we all knew would not be the ""Oz"" like miracle place that Becca expected it to be, was never fully explored. The supporting characters were almost painful to read about, whorebabies and homosexual ""abominations"" took the brunt of the abuse. Becca's behavior is also confusing and even when the story resolved itself in the end, I was still left with a sense of ""Is that all there is?"" I still enjoyed the read though, Becca had captured my imagination and I suppose that with that Ms. Ester Freisner did what she was supposed to do. Read this to finish off a very uncomfortable but believable view of what our society could one day devolve into."
1,Bagdad murder,"If you enjoy watching American boys being shot, killed and maimed this is the movie for you. The background music is nothing but ancient Arabic chants laced with radical Islamic hate speech.New Bagdad Sniper"
2,Check your local stores first.....,"I found the exact same cutter cheaper at my local ""big box"" store. On top of finding it cheaper, I wouldn't recommend it unless you are cutting very thin glass.......It's cheaply made regarding the cutting wheel, and I just couldn't make myself appreciate it. Had I paid anymore money for it, I would be extremely disappointed!This is a tough one to review. I just don't like it. I think it could have been made better, and to work more efficient."
1,Don't waste your time,Don't waste your time or money with this. Just go straight for the pistol grip glass cutter.
3,Wanted it to be more history,I was looking for a more historical movie this seemed a little lacking in that line. I didn't learn a whole lot about the Black Indians like I thought I would.
5,Read the book 4 times already.,I found this book completely absorbing and could not put it down. I re-read it and found even more in the story at each reading. I felt I was in that orphanage with Martha and wanted to take us both home to love and comfort.. I cannot wait to read a sequel. Please get writing soon Martha.
4,good but,the e grip is very good but when i am shooting semi some times it skips to fully auto for no reason can any body help me?!?
5,ONLY FOR REAL SAVED FOLKS,"This is a powerful, spiritual, up-lifting book. Ms. Beverly has done a great job with this book. You will feel Nikki's pain, joy, sadness, and happiness. You will walk step-by-step in her walk with God. I commend Ms. Beverly for writing this book. We need more books like this. I can't wait for the next one! Stay Blessed!"
2,Average... okay I guess,It's not really what I was looking for in a novel. The religion is so stereotype for black people to use. The writing is okay but still needs just a little more meat.
5,Watch that first step!,"When I was a kid, I read every single one of MacLean's novels -- and this was the one I found hardest to put down! With a plot involving a Pinkerton agent on board a train in the American West, it is somewhat different from other MacLean novels -- but just as authentic and exciting! If you're a MacLean fan, it'd be well worth your time to track down an edition of this overlooked gem."
3,An English Western,"""Breakheart Pass"" is famed British story-teller Alistair Maclean's crack at writing a western novel. The plot concerns mysterious events on a train traveling to a remote U.S. Army Fort in what may be the Nevada Territory of the mid-1870's. The riders on the train, a collection of soldiers, politicians, and lawmen, are not who they seem, nor is the situation at the distant Fort as advertised. Fans of Maclean will recognize the usual plots twists, thrill-packed finale, and sardonic dialogue.Maclean is less successful capturing an authentic tone of the frontier West. His characters are a foreigner's view of American stereotypes. The leading character, the mysterious Deakin, is not a particularly interesting protagonist, and the plot is unusually contrived and difficult to follow for Maclean. The story still manages to be interesting and even entertaining, but it is not up to Maclean's best efforts.This book is recommended to fans of Alistair Maclean."
2,Not My Cup of (English) Tea,"Unfortunately, I found this novel to epitomize trite stereotypes of the fading Wild West. The author is an Englishman who wrote the book from England. His observations and character developments are over the top and clearly based on the stereotypes of Western Americans that were widely circulated in Europe.It was really tough to get past the first chapter."
4,Bulbs,"Bulbs are bulbs, but they arrived fast and this drill and light combo was purchased at Lowes. They still carry the combo kit, but they never carry the bulbs.....ever."
2,"This is the re-titled version #5 of the ""Russian"" text.","Originally titled: 'Brainwashing, A Synthesis of the Russian Textbook on Psychopolitics'. Do a google search with the booklet's name plus ""Hubbard,"" and find out who actually wrote it. Unfortunately, Goff forgot to remove some of the Dianetic and Scientology lingo from the booklet. Oops! Maybe by version #10, they'll finally remove the references to 'Dianetics', etc. This doesn't mean that your concerns about totalitarianism are silly. They're not. But, as we say in Brooklyn, my dear fellow, this booklet happens to be a fake."
2,Weak,"I cant complain too much, as this cd came with Sonar 5 as a promotional deal, but I would personally avoid purchasing it. It has a short series of ~8min flash videos that give a very brief overview of the product, as it barely skims the surface of the main features. Consider it an audi version of reading the back of the box.Furthermore, I am not sure why they use audio examples that would not have been fit for one of the beverlyhills cop movies, let alone contemporary music production. In my opinion, save your money."
2,"Lovely photos , no new projects to speak off","Sue Spears the owner of The Candle Shop in convent Garden London is the collater of this book, she has put together a lovely visual book , but with no really new ideas . And some of the material suggestions as a bit silly , a nice coffee table book on candles, not really informative for the candlemaker."
2,insane price,why is a 2 dvd set so expensive?????? I'd love to see this again but there's no way i'd pay so much for something that should be much cheaperif price ever does come down feel free to e-mail me on jcomic@indigo.ie so i can purchase a copy
2,Excellent Presentation,"Vietnam: The Ten Thousand Day War; Without a doubt the best of all Vietnam documentaries. But at $800.00 for six and half hours of TV??? The price is ludicrous. I have many TV series on DVD that are far longer than this and just as enjoyable to watch, but none would ever pull $800.00 from my bank account under any circumstances."
4,overpriced,"Why would anyone pay $480.00 for this admittedly great series--on VHS no less? I remember enjoying the entire series on PBS years ago and would gladly spend a hundred dollars for the boxed set. In fact, I recently purchased the greatest of war documentaries, The World at War, via Amazon, for a mere thirtysomething bucks. I guess my next stop for war series will be the public library."
4,VETNAM,It a very well done documenty series on Vetnam. It trys to tell the story with out the rewriting history or the preaching (as commonly done with any of the history chanles). It contains some very good interviews with all both sides of the war. It well worth watching it for the interveiw Northern Vetnam leaders and US as well. I would say the only better Documenty would be WGBH Vetnam .
2,Very unbalanced point of view,"This documentary is overwhelmingly pro-war, anti-Vietnamese. It essentially demonizes the Vietnamese who fought for their country and totally disregards the fact that the US attempting to force its will on them led to the deaths of 3 million Asians.This documentary is a cheap rebuttal to the balanced documentary Vietnam: A Television History, which I highly recommend."
1,dreamGear games a real nightmare...,"When I purchased this, I thought, ""there's 60 games, there's gotta be something good on it."" I was proved wrong. After going through each game one time (all of which I had never heard of), I realized that even though it only cost $14.41, it wasn't worth it at all. Save your money for a different plug and play item, like Super Pac Man!"
3,Review of Bassing with the Best,"Overall good collection of tips from pro bass fisherman on top bass fishing techniques. Material includes personal bio's, equipment to use, fishing conditions, weather and seasonal patterns. Unfortunately, in several techniques, such as Carolina Rig fishing, the focus was uneven with more written on equipment than its use. After reading the material several times, I was still left wondering how to retrieve a Carolina rigged bait."
4,Very good book!,"The author also heads up BASS instructional courses held through out the country where he has the nation's top pros giving seminars. Not surprisingly, he has the edge on what is important to know, and how to teach it. A very informative book. Recently moved and cleared out some of the useless fishing books in my library. This is one I kept."
2,Too Predictable,"Mr. Perry needs to take a break for a while. The story lines are too similar and very predictable. Imagine, hearing a particular line and each time you are asking yourself "" which one of the other movies that line in again?""Mr. Perry might be spoiling a good thing that is going on - ""over cook""."
5,Bluray dvd,This was a purchase for my daughter and she did not have a negative experience with the dvd. I had it shipped to her with expedited service and she received it within 2 days from purchase... Would purchase from this seller again
5,I love this movie,I have been wanting to order this movie every since I saw it.. And I was very pleased and happy when I got it..Thank You
3,Not what I expected,"I have every Tyler Perry dvd to date. I enjoy Tyler Perry's writing, directing, producing and acting. Tyler Perry has a knack putting the right hollywood actress/actor into his characters. I Can Do Bad All By Myself has a good story line/plot. What ruined the movie is the character MADEA being written into the story/plot. WHY???? Made no sense, very distracting, nothing to do with the story. Bad attempt at ""comedy?"" Should have been ANY ONE but the character of MEDEA for the plot to build around. Otherwise, the acting was very good. Taraji P. Henson has a great future as an actress, as does Adam Rodriguez. Mary J Blige and Gladys Knight need acting lessons and should never have been written into the script in the first place. This one is average Tyler Perry, disappointing to say the least. If you are a Tyler Perry collector like I am, buy it and be disappointed with me. If not, wait for it to come out on TV and save your money."
3,Not Bad!!!,"As Tyler Perry movies go, this one was pretty good. Some of the nightclub scenes were decent because some women had beautiful singing voices, such as Mary J. Blige, but they overdid it toward the end. Madea is always hilarious, and the film itself deals with a woman named April who is an alcoholic and in an abusive relationship. April is the aunt of Jennifer, Manny, and Byron. She is forced to take them in when their mother can't be found. Soon after, the Church sends Sandino to work and stay at her house. Slowly, April begins to care for each of them. I would recommend I CAN DO BAD ALL BY MYSELF!!!"
5,WOW,great movie great love story Tyler Perry knocked it out the park again I loved it so if you won't a great movie buy this one.
5,Selflessness,"This movie gives insight into how a life is robbed of joy when a person is self-centered instead of seeking to make others a priority by showing kindness, compassion and concern; but most especially---LOVE."
5,I love this movie,"Tyler Perry has done it again. I laughed, cried and laughed again at this wonderful movie. The singing in the movie was great. Gladys Knight's voice still sounds as good as ever. Keep making your movies Tyler and I will continue to support you."
3,"Too Little, Too Late","I had ordered ""Tyler Perry's I Can Do Bad All By Myself"" for a birthday present. I promptly received ""Tyler Perry's What's Done In the Dark"". I immediately contacted the seller asking how to correct the problem & heard nothing back. I sent a second request & heard nothing back. About 2 weeks later (after the birthday & another gift had been purchased) I received a copy of ""Tyler Perry's I Can Do Bad All By Myself"". It would have been nice to receive an email saying that a corrected order had been shipped!!! With a simple email, I might have rated them with 5 stars."
1,Someone please make it stop!,"Okay, where do I begin? This film really insults my intelligence. The writing is just horrible. Outside of the eye candy (the leading actors), there was nothing good about it. The story was all over the place, there were forced performances by big named singers for no apparent reason and I could barely make it through the first 20 minutes. When is Hollywood going to stop putting so much money behind movies with absolutely no substance? Shame on them for making this film and making us pay to see it."
1,i can do bad all by myself,i still have not recieved my copy of the movie it was suppose to be here by march 5th but still no movie
5,I Can Do Bad All By Myself (Full Screen Edition),"When Madea catches sixteen-year-old Jennifer and her two younger brothers looting her home, she decides to take matters into her own hands and delivers the young delinquents to the only relative they have: their aunt April. A heavy-drinking nightclub singer who lives off of Raymond, her married boyfriend, April wants nothing to do with the kids. But her attitude begins to change when Sandino, a handsome Mexican immigrant looking for work, moves into April's basement room. Making amends for his own troubled past, Sandino challenges April to open her heart. And April soon realizes she must make the biggest choice of her life: between her old ways with Raymond and the new possibilities of family, faith and even true love. I have all of Tyler Perry's movies and plays, and this movie is very entertaining. No one does it better but Tyler Perry."
4,Another solid by Tyler Perry,"Having seen several other Tyler Perry movies, I was not disappointed in this one. Like other movies, this features people down on their luck (in this case, three kids) and people dealing with their problems the best they can. Of course, seeing Madea is always a treat, and I loved the way she handled the kids, especially the oldest girl when she threatens to call the cops and Madea's all like, you gonna need to be able to get to the phone to call 911, and the girl's like 'I might have a cellphone' and Madea just retorts that she will need a surgery to get the cell out of her throat. Hysterical, really. If you like Mr. Perry's other movies, you'll definitely like this one."
4,Good one time reading.,"The book is truly a required reading for anyone, who wants to work in the field of semiconductor opticas. The choice of topics and the presentation are excellent. However, the book does not go really deep in any of the topics, therefore I doubt that anyone will read this book more than once or use it as a reference.Some topic and, especially, equations may seem too overused in later books and review papers, but apparently this book was the first to present them and here they are truly enlightening."
4,"Boots are sizzling hot, but....","I LOVE these boots! Well, the truth is, I just ""like"" them, but everyone else seems to love them, and I get compliments and double-takes every time I wear them.One thing to note is that the picture makes them appear to be a muted silver, but they are NOT, they are more like a lamé. They are very shiny and very ""loud"" boots. They are pretty comfortable, especially for the pointy toe. I wore them when travelling from Atlanta to San Diego, with a connection in Denver. I did a WHOLE lot of walking in those boots (while carrying a garment bag), and my feet didn't really hurt until I got to San Diego, after having had them on for umpteen hours.They look great with jeans, gauchos, capris, skirts... definitely a hot boot.The only problem I have with them is that the second time I wore them, the chain on the back broke. I'm not very happy about that because the little ring around the heel fell off before I noticed that it had broken, so I can't get it fixed. GRRRR!!!"
2,Cute but not good for small calves.,This boot is very flashy and definetly a show stopper. The boot is very big around the calve area and the chains started to fall off after the second wear.
5,Creativity tempered by smarts! = DEEELICIOUS,"Just seeing the cover gave my heart a jolt. GREATEST BOOK!!! It molded my personal style, speaking to me at a crossroads. The timing may not be right for you....it was perfect for me.You can't help but learn something by reading this thoroughly enjoyable romp through other people's closets & minds. Just hearing their highly individual opinions on style (many different folks are represented in mini-interviews, or excellent sidebars about everyone/everything from Diana Vreeland to Biba) is a lip-smacking pleasure. The fact that you learn so much is a wonderful discovery and creeps up on you quietly.I LOVE YOU CHEAP CHIC - I ALWAYS HAVE and I ALWAYS WILL!!(The original WAS better; but if you can't have it, this'll make your iconoclast's heart sing. You'll read it more than once.~TRUST ME.~ )"
4,Easy to Follow,"This easy to follow guide to fitness and health is good for beginners as well as people who have let the pounds and the years creep up on them and put them in creepy condition! Common Sensical and practical, without baloney theories, this is a truly helpful guide."
2,"Parts Missing, Reorderd Item Different","I ordered this item because it had the Moog/Precision name on it. Moog parts have always been top quality for me. Item arrived in a box with greasy fingerprints on it. The kit was missing the replacement c-clip and also the instructions. So I had a replacement kit sent. It had the c-clip and instructions. But the boot in the replacement set was different, and lower quality from the first one. The first boot was stamped Longwood, which I believe is s quality US part maker. The 2nd boot had no name stamped on it and appeared to be of poorer quality."
2,not modern toilet rooms here!,"I was very disappointed with the book. The best picture is of the cover. If you like 80's design, this is the book for you."
2,Big disappointment,"Wasted my money on this one. I have the same comments as the other reviewer. The pictures are old. Or maybe the book is printed on cheap paper, becuase all the pictures look faded out. Definitely a let down. Still trying to find a book on the coolest bathrooms, loos. (Anyone been to the Penisula Hotel, Hong Kong? Their top-floor bar designed was designed by Philip starck...what an awesome loo. You are like peeing over the whole city)"
4,Fun Scooby Doo stories!,"My son loves Scooby Doo and this baseball mystery is really fun. My son is 5 years old now, so we usually read a couple chapters a night before bed. A little too long to read the whole thing in one sitting. It is one story with several chapters. Book came as promised, in time for my son's birthday. Thanks."
2,Major flaw ruins otherwise great watch,"A solid, high quality watch ruined by a stupid bracelet clasp of questionable sizing. There are only 2 clasp adjustment holes to choose from, so there is virtually no fine adjustment of bracelet size. Don't expect the watch to fit your wrist very well because adjustment via metal link removal is coarse.If the clasp was bigger, I'd give this watch a rating of 5 stars.Also, there aren't any replacement bracelets that are compatible with this series."
5,Does exactly what I expected,"I bought this watch to replace a timex ironman because I wanted something a bit dressier. I liked the countdown and alarm features of my ironman, and I found the same features in this watch.I removed one link and it fits ok. The digital display is easy to read and the analog face looks great."
5,Buy once and be DONE - Nice product. Works as it should.,"I've been wary of purchasing tire inflators because the ones I've used, borrowed, and/or bought have been junk. I didn't want to spend the extra $ and be unhappy.The Amflo appears to be a durable fairly high quality inflator. This isn't that cheap garbage that places like H*&^^* F*&^%$$ sell.Spend the $ once and save the frustration of working with inferior products."
2,not very effective,"I'm a 41 year old mom of two. I work out 6 days a week, run 5 m 4 of the 6 days, so I consider myself in good shape. This DVD has big problem: every segment has a few minutes of warm up and i think it should have a segment for warm up (5 min.) and then the 10 min. segments which I think are not that bad but when I'm already warm up and working out it is a little annoying to have to start again every 10 min. I will not use this DVD again."
4,Excellant Cardio,"I typically do more toning exercises than cardio, so I bought this DVD to work more cardio into my exercise program. This DVD provides a great cardio workout, as well as some toning. The day after my 1st time using this DVD my muscles ached all over. Where each segment is only 10 minutes, it moves really quickly & some of the exercises seem to move too quickly to have the accurate form. But overall this is a great DVD."
4,awesome!,"One of the best videos I have come across....very fast,high impact and practical! No complicated moves and the instructor is encouraging without being annoying...definitely recommended!"
2,NOT for beginners,"I knew this DVD would be challenging...Well, just watching it made me short of breath. This is definitely not for the beginner. I am significantly overweight, but young and pretty healthy otherwise. I ordered a balance ball kit---LOVE IT, and a pedal exerciser to use at work---another good choice. I got this DVD to mix it up and get a good cardio workout a couple times a week. Well, it's going to be awhile before I even attempt these workouts. It's very discouraging, and sometimes dangerous to try and work beyond your fitness level."
5,Absolutely Perfect,"As someone who depises cardio, this is the perfect workout for me. In fact, it has me so spoiled, I can't bear to do any of my previous workouts.I love it because it doesn't waste any time. By minute 3 I am sweating. And with 5 different workouts, it's hard to get bored. Michelle is an excellent instructor, and knowing it will be over in 10 minutes motivates me to work harder.My favorite is the third workout which uses pylometics. The first one is also great and a great add on to other workouts. I also enjoy the fourth bootcamp style one (it also works your abs). The last one is more toning than cardio and great for those time crunched days.That said there is little instruction as to proper form, really no warmup and little cool down, and moves very quickly in order to maximize time. Therefore it may not be the best for beginner exercisers."
4,Good Cardio,"Being a new mom, I sometimes can barely make it through a 40 minute workout on any given day; so this DVD is great because you can pick and choose what kind of workout you want, according to priority. Be prepared to do a lot of jumping, squats and planks. If you can do all five segments, you will work up a major sweat!"
5,10 minute solution is great!,This 10 minute solution is really good. Easy to follow up. Really good choise for those who don't have time to exercise.10 Minute Solution - Carb and Calorie Burner
5,Easy routines and a great workout!,"I'm an experienced exerciser with good stamina. I like intense workouts, but I hate wasting time learning complex choreagraphy. This workout doesn't build complex aerobic combinations, it's more like bootcamp moves and kickboxing. It's easy to follow along and really got me sweating! (Although as an advanced exerciser, I need more than one segment to get a workout.) And I did it with very limited floor space! I highly recommend this one!"
5,Really works!!!,"I love all 10 min solutions, and I have most of them, so far this is the best one. I lost a lot of weight with this DVD."
5,Loved it!,I loved this video! You cant just do one section and get a workout (im sorry...10 min is just not gonna cut it) but you can easily add a section to your other workouts and being able to alter the order is great. She does a good job leading (peppy but not annoying) and you spend most of your time moving as opposed to some of the other videos in the series. I do DVDs at home almost nightly and by alternating 3 sections from the DVD with strength or playing the whole thing through I have yet to be bored with it (4 weeks now). If you are more advanced you might want to add light leg or ankle weights to up the intensity
5,Perfect solution,"I love it. We all buy workout tapes and never use them, but this one's been an exception for me. 5 different 10 minute routines you can either do 1 at a time, play all through for 50 minutes, or create a custom workout by picking 2 or 3 up front and in the order you want - it plays them for you that way - no stopping in the middle to grab the remote. You can change it up each time so you don't get bored.Also, the instructor isn't insanely irritating like so many of her peers.I like the ""Slow and Steady Burn"" in the morning, just to get my blood moving. Non-gym nights I try to sneak off for 20 minutes to do the Carb Killer (simple kickboxing moves) combined with 1 other that I rotate each time. Like another reviewer, I also have 2 toddlers and this DVD keeps me fit and sane in the time I have available."
5,THIS CD IS THE BOMB. GO BUY IT TODAY!!!,"IF YOU LIKE THE HBO SERIES 'OZ' YOU WILL LOVE THIS SOUNDTRACK. MY FAVORITE TRACK IS THE KURUPT & NATE DOG JAM, ""BEHIND THE WALLS"". I ALSO LIKE THE WU TANG CLAN SONG, THE KRAYZIE BONE JOINT AND SNOOP'S SONG ""WELCOME TO OZ"". I'M A BIG FAN OF THE SHOW AND I THINK THIS CD IS THE PERFECT ACCOMPANIMENT. OH YEAH, THE CYPRESS HILL JOINT IS FLAVA ALSO!!!!"
2,WHACK SOUDTRACK WITH 3 PHAT SONGS ON IT,"OZ THE SOUNDTRACK IS WHACK AND THE SHOW ON HBO IS WAY BETTER. THE ONLY SONGS ON IT LIKE I LIKE IS A PHAT WU-TANG SONG PRODUCED BY TRU MASTER THAT IS A BANGER FOR REAL, PHAROAHE MONCH JOINT WHICH IS A BANGER AND THE OZ THEME SONG WITH LORD JAMAL TALIB KWELI AND KOOL G RAP ON IT. THE REST IS GARBAGE AND NOT WORTH BUYING. LIKE DRAG ON HAHAHAHAH AND ALL THAT DOWN SOUTH CRAP. DON'T PICK THIS WHACK SOUNDTRACK UP, BUT TRY TO DUB THOSE 3 TRACKS OFF IT LIKE ME."
3,"A few nice tracks, but a one-dimensional theme","Like most soundtracks, this one serves it's purpose, but is nothing special musically.There are a few nice tracks, like Behind The Walls, I'm Shackled Up, and War Wit Us. But the majority of the album is filled with just average music (the exception being Master P's ""Locked Up,"" which would qualify as just AWFUL music).The album also suffers from a lack of diversity subject matter-wise. While it serves it's purpose as far as relating to the show, it makes for a monotonous listen.Best advice: unless you're a die-hard Oz fan, save your money."
4,SOLID MATERIAL THROUGHOUT,WOW I WAS SUPRISED AT THE CONSISTENCY ON THIS LP RIGHT HERE.. WHILE THERE IS NOT ONE STANDOUT CUT THERE REALLY ISNT ANY SUBPAR CUTS EITHER. THE WHOLE CD IS DOPE. ONE OF THE MOST SOLID CDS FROM BEGINNING TO END THAT I HAVE HEARD IN A WHILE. BUY IT.
5,this soundtrack is bangin!,"this is the best soundtrack i heard in a while people! kurupt's track is bangin with nate in the background giving him some love. wu-tang's track is tite with rza coming with some follow up lyrics from his domestic violence track from bobby digital. snoop's and drag on's track on it is just funky, something you can bounce and rub up on a girl to, nah mean. pharoahe monch comes correct on the lyrics for his track ""what is the law"" and the beat gets your head noddin. krayzie bone's track is a mellow track something for you peeps to smoke to. kool g rap comes through with some thug rhymes on the oz theme joint. and cypress hill came through with a dope track. if you feelin the show and a hiphop fan you gotta check this album out. if you just a hiphop head and can't afford HBO or just have basic cable or no cable at all check it out for some bangin tracks by some of hiphop's best, nah mean. CA all DAY! peace!"
2,Dat CD is Aiight,"Look here playas. This CD is Kinda whack because these idiots Wu-Tang and Bone are on it and kill it to death. Kurupt, Snoop, and Cypress make this CD a beauty. Three 6 Mafia also has a Nice bomb track on it. big ups to Kurupt and Snoop and Nate. DONT BUY THIS CD. It is very repetitios and boring. just get the tracks from kurupt, snoop, cypress, and 36mafia.... this CD isnt good to WASTE money on."
3,Not That Great,"This cd is not what i expected it to be. With all of the good rappers on it, i thought it would be some what good. I was wrong. The only good song on this cd is Three 6 Mafia - War Wit Us. If you're looking for a good cd, don't get this one"
2,Not the real deal...,"I don't know why I bought this book. It seemed like good fluff reading. It wasn't. I'm a New York City cop, and yes ESU does amazing things and they are invaluable to us. But the author spends the entire book rehashing none too exciting stories and kissing up to all the cops. Sentences like, ""These guys are the real heroes of the job."" are nice when uttered by some unknown sergeant in Brooklyn, but they keep getting repeated over and over. This book isn't really even worth this much typing on my part. If you're looking for fluff that glamorizes this job, then buy this book. If you're looking for a true and in depth account of the NYPD's special rescue and weapons capabilities, then keep looking."
3,"Good, but...","It was a good book but it over-glorified everything a little too much. In other words, it was a little one-sided and the stories were a little repeatitive, but it was interesting and entertaining."
2,I'll admit... I didn't finish it,"Ok so I really only got through the first 70 pages or so but I couldn't take anymore. Obvious fluff, idiotic allegories ""this hit was his baby and it had all the signs of a miscarriage"", use of ""bad guys"" to describe criminals and suspected perps, and a blatant biased view of the city that he so wonderfully addresses as vomit-like and a magnet for all insane and dangerous people. Hey, I live in NY and while it has it's moments, it's my home and it's not that bad. Last time I checked, plenty of crime occurred in other places as well. The ESU is an extremely valuable force that does some amazing things. It's a shame this book didn't focus more on telling the tales of the job WITHOUT the feel of an over-hyped accident/car-crash/shoot-em-up FOX series."
2,Camera bag,"I got the bag fairly quickly. After having it for a few months I was in Walmart getting some pictures printed while having the bag on my sholder. The coupling that holds the strap to the bag broke in half for no reason. I called Cameta and they promptly send me a new bag at no extra charge. But sadly the new bag, one of the clasps that keep the lid closed broke the next day. I think I got the defective bags. But all in all, I like the bag and still use it and Cameta handled it very well."
4,WOW This Book Is Wonderful.,Rick Steves has done a wonderful job with this book..I have been to London twice and have used his book and a couple of others too help me get the most out of my vacation time in London. I recommend this book to anyone traveling to London. Happy Reading and Happy Travels.
4,NFL Greatest Follies,"This was a christmas gift and I was unable to view them, but my grandson really liked the video tapes."
4,amazing dark techno,"PWOG are dark and simple, but never as sparse as a lot of newer ""minimal"" techno. I like this disk more than the more widely known ""Ov Biospheres and Sacred Grooves."" While most of this is four on the floor techno, some tracks have a triplet feel. While i've stoped listenening to a lot of early 90's techno, this disk has stayed in my CD player.Overall, I'd say that if you've never heard PWOG before you might want to start with the ""History of the Psychic Phenomenon"" 2CD set which includes some of this disk. If you need more get this."
1,I never received this item,"my order was placed, confimation acknowledged, shipment date estimated. No merchandise received. Multiple attempts made the vender via phone and email. No response. I paid for 2 dog beds at MuttMart.I need help either obtaining my merchandise or getting a refund"
5,From a returned soldier,"I returned from Iraq in june of 2004. This movie is the most accurate portrait of the Iraqi public opinion that I have encountered. I know that this film showed a small sampling of what a few people think, but it was well rounded. I found this film to be both uplifting and heart breaking. It is definitly worth seeing. It didn't come to a lot of theaters but I was lucky to see it in Marion, Iowa of all places. I applaude the manager of that theater for bringing such a powerful film to my area.Thank you,SPC Eric Williams389th ENG"
3,a different perspective w/ questionable value,"It is exactly what it says it is - voices of Iraq. Now, just for a second, imagine what ""voices"" you would have if you handed out hundreds of cameras to regular citizens in the US and asked them to just go crazy and record their daily lives. That is what this film is only the setting, the citizens, being in Iraq. Make up your own mind the value of that. For me, while a somewhat interesting and an often unseen point of view, I'm still on the fence of the value. Going back to the example of doing the same thing in the US, I can't say as it would mean much - focusing on what regular citizens ""believe"". People often have no clue, especially people who have been repressed for so long as they admit throughout. You may as well ask a soldier why his government is at war. As if he would know. He's a pawn, as much as these voices of Iraq are the audience, in the games of much more rich and powerful men."
4,Not for the faint-hearted or the young,"I got this to use excerpts for a 7th grade geography class. My 21-year-old daughter watched it with me when I previewed it, and was horrified at how graphic it was. It shows lots of close-ups of dead bodies when talking about gassing the Kurds. It shows some pretty overwhelming footage in the section on ""atrocities"" under Saddam. It's horrible that children in Iraq are exposed to violence on a daily basis. But to expose 7th graders here to those images is not solving anything. I'm assuming this DVD was not intended for my 7th graders. Also, I agree that this has a very ""pro-invasion"" slant. But there are one or two milder excerpts I may still use with my students."
4,Voices of Iraq DVD,"I have always been interested in how people's lives are lived around the world, but having recently made a new friend from Iraq, I am even more curious about what kind of life the people there have. My friend left Iraq because he is a Christian and in constant fear for his well-being.The video footage on this is all amateur and can be a little shaky and choppy at times, but the essence of what people are saying while sharing their experiences - sometimes even while chaos is breaking out around them - is very telling and sometimes very poignant. I can only imagine what direction the stability of country has headed towards in the nearly nine years since the video footage was created. I hope that the people there are able to find peace and rebuild their lives.The war in Iraq has been a mixed blessing for the people there and I liked that this documentary touched on so many different emotions and even has lighter moments of humor among the many tales of hardship and loss."
5,What readers can learn from Tolkien's classic parables,"Walking With Frodo: A Devotional Journey Through ""The Lord of the Rings"" is a spiritual devotional by freelance writer and Lord of the Rings enthusiast Sarah Arthur draws wisdom from both Christian Scripture and the popular ""Lord of the Rings"" fantasy novels by J. R. R. Tolkien (who was himself a devout believer in Christ). Guiding us through the perilous choices of life, revealing what the Bible has to say about them, and explaining what readers can learn from Tolkien's classic parables, Walking With Frodo offers a unique and highly recommended exploration of the depths of faith and the meaning of spirituality."
3,Doesn't always hold up...,"This is a very enjoyable devotional book, or just a book to sit down with on a rainy day. I didn't really get much out of it, though, either about Lord of the Rings or Christianity. Some of the ""parallels"" the author draws between characters in LotR and real life are flimsy and don't make much sense--she compares Faramir, for example, to someone you see at a party one night, having a great old time, and leading a Bible study the next. Huh? It maybe could have benefited from some more in-depth looks at certain things.But it's good, especially for Lord of the Rings-obsessed Christians."
1,Walking with Frodo,"This could have been a very interesting read. It took us along with Frodo with many bible references. This is fine but unfortunately the author also tended to pontificate rather too much. As an open thinker I found this to be too ""you must dothings this way"" for my liking. It could have allowed the reader more freedom on their ""devotional"" journey than it did."
1,Get a clue,"The author himself said the books ARE NOT ALLEGORIES!!Will you people quit taking all the good stories of the world (Harry Potter, C S Lewis Chronicles to name a few) and STOP making them all about jesus. Just as Freud said ""Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar""...Sometimes a good story is just a good story! Most of the time in fact. Now stop picking it apart and ruining it for the rest of us. You put this garbage out there and now instead of having a lively discussion about a great story, there is the Christian stigma stuck to it and it turns into a religious debate. Forget walking with Frodo, just walk with jesus..and keep right on walking past all the good things in life before you taint them too."
1,What is this?,"Never in my life have I heard of such rubbish. The Word of God is to be the only basic source for the study of God's Word--not a trilogy of fantasy novels. Many Christians are becoming so wrapped up in pop culture that they have trouble differentiating the difference between the fictional events found within The Lord of the Rings and the true, inerrant Word of God.We need to get out of Middle-Earth and into the real world. You cannot find strength, guidance, and spiritual power in a fictional collection of stories, regardless of whether or not they are allegories of the Christian's journey.""Walking With Frodo""?! Is this meant to equate Frodo with Jesus Christ? Reality check: Frodo was never real, Middle-Earth was never real, and all the events which took place within Tolkien's world never happened. Christ was real, however. The battles He faced and the battles we face are very real, and we therefore should not waste our time in thinking that this garbage will assist us in them."
4,Pretty Creepy,"If you were thinking of adopting, maybe you should think again. You could get a ""bad seed"" is the premise of this book. The creepy girl who is the main character, has absolutely no conscience and is completely narcissistic. This is attributed to genetics. Anyway, it is an entertaining tale, suspenseful, well written, a quick read and a surprise ending...."
4,Better than the standard,"I bought this as a second controller to the wireless one that comes bundled with the GH3 PS2 package.This is a far better guitar than the standard one that comes with the game. The response is a lot better and it feels more solid. I don't even use the standard guitar and I'll probably get another one of these so other people can play along with me.Cons: star power can be a pain. Even going vertical, sometimes it doesn't engage. The neck is indeed a LITTLE shorter than the standard guitar which is already short as-is. Also the cord could be a little longer, but it's about the same length as any PS2 controller's cord. (I'd still take wired over wireless any day)"
1,Not very durable,"I have gone through two of these guitars within two days...both times the guitar worked fine, then it stopped working during actual gameplay. It navigated menu's fine but would not cooperate for the songs themselves. I played it with guitar hero III on PS 2...I tried to be as gentle as possible and I still only got through one mode of songs with the 2nd guitar...which is more then the first guitar! I would not recommend this product; it's not durable for normal gameplay. I am hoping to have better luck w/ a redoctane guitar"
3,Just spend the extra 10-20 bucks on the official guitar,"I bought this as a second guitar to use when playing Guitar Hero, and it quickly became the Losers guitar. No one wanted to use it.The neck is a lot shorter, so it feels different playing, it might be nice for children, but even being a small-ish girl it was annoying for me to play.The buttons are spaced differently also, and I have trouble hitting certain notes together because of this. My fingers slide off the fret buttons more often and they stick sometimes too.Also ""star power"" is activated by tilting the guitar upward, but again, it doesn't react as well as the offical Red Octane guitar.Next time I'll just cough up the extra cash and buy the official gear."
1,React Guitar Sucks,"I got this guitar as a Christmas present. This guitar is awful. It is short, the buttons are spaced far apart, and they stick. The fret bar goes down ok but if you want to strum up and down for quicker and closer notes it won't go up and down. Sometimes it does not respond to you strumming the notes. Also it does not respond well when you pull up on the guitar for your star power and it messes up your notes you are trying to play. I do not recommend this guitar for anyone. Buy the redoctane guitar, I am!!!"
1,dont buy from this seller,This was suppose to be a christmas present but I never recvd it. the seller never replied to my many emails. It was a nightmare!!! Thank God Amazon got my money back. But my son still does not have his guitar to play his games with. Amazon is great but beware when you buy from outside sellers like this one!1
2,Mine broke too!,"Bought this guitar from Best Buy, and it worked well for about a month, but now ... nothing. And like the other guy, when I took it out of the box, I too had a piece rattling around inside. I would definitely not recommend it. Fortunately, I will be getting the GH-World Tour package with the official guitar, so ..."
4,react rocker ehh,ok this guitar is ok.. but at times its hard to get the orange and green on a chord.. but other wise this guitar is preety good for the price they are sellin it to you for. you should get it
4,"Good, inexpensive alternative","The guitar feels a little different than the official one. The spacing between the buttons isn't exactly the same and the opposite side is rounded. That being said, this has worked great for me. I didn't want to pay full price for another official guitar after having already spent so much to get the game with my first guitar, so I went with this and I am satisfied with my purchase. It has allowed me to play with two people and I have not had any problems with it. If you and all your friends are hardcore guitar hero players, then go for the official, but if you are a casual gamer or don't play on expert, this is a great way to allow two people to play without spending too much extra money."
1,"I would give it 1/2 a star if I could, it breaks easily","This thing broke pretty much as soon as I bought it.It worked for roughly one hour, then nothing. I could see if I had been banging it around or letting children use it that it might have broken from ill-use, but seeing as how I don't have children and the most movement I made with this thing was to sit down, well, this product sucks.I'm going to return it and buy something different. All the local stores are out of anything else, but I'll wait for weeks if I have to, I'm not going with the same brand."
1,Size problems,"This shirt was for my husband and very nice color and looked to be a good quality product. Although the other reviews I read said to order a size larger to be sure it fit I found this to be slightly exaggerated. He wears xl in T shirts, polo shirts and button down shirts and so I ordered the XXL for his swim shirt. When I received it and he tried to put it on he couldn't get the neck opening over his head without stretching it out. When he did get it on it was something akin to a second skin. I'm not sure a XXXL would have fit even if they made that size, which they don't. Probably a good product for skinny adults and kids."
1,not the same color,"I ordered the Carolina Blue color for my boyfriend, which looks like a muted gray/ blue color in the photo. However, what I received in the mail was more like a girly lavender/ blue color. Needless to say it was a total waste because what guy is going to go surfing in a lavender rash guard? So, I ate it on this one because I didn't want to waste any more money shipping it back.If you purchase this be prepared for some color differentiation."
2,Giallo obsessed?,"I was disappointed in this film. I was expecting to enjoy it, but only in parts. This film falls into the genre, ""Giallo"". It is sort of hard to find, but only for hardcore ""Giallo/Thriller"" fans.Other rare gems to look for would be: ""The House of the Yellow Carpet"", ""The Killer Wore Gloves"", ""Cosi Dolce Cosi Perversa"", ""Eyeball"", and ""The Iguana with the Tongue of Fire"". These are worth looking for!!!"
3,Too plain,"I bought this book attracted by the title, but little bit disappointed. It was too plain and had few things new. Need to be more tight."
3,To Whom Has the Power of Death Diminish?,"What is the difference between being brought back to life after one has died and to be resurrected from the dead? Resuscitation not in the sense that the body has just quit functioning recently but in the sense that the body has stop working and is dead for matter of days or longer. What is the significance of the Resurrection of Jesus? What is the significance of the resurrection of believers and the damnation of unbelievers? That there is only one way to get salvation from God's wrath, one way to receive forgiveness, and only way to receive Eternal Life. To have a resuscitated life is to face death again to have eternal life is to be free damnation and the consequences of sin. The Power of Death has only been reduced to those who repent and believe. Lutzer books about Satan, Miracles and the Divinci Code are better books but this one is a good read."
3,Good reading,"*** Death is often called the last enemy; yet if you know Christ, He has defeated that enemy and turned it to a friend. It was this truth that gave the early martyrs the strength to face death for the sake of faith, and this promise that makes funerals an issue of personal sorrow at a temporary separation rather than a final goodbye and agony at never seeing the loved one again. This book illustrates all of what death means to a Christian. Whether you are mourning someone or facing death yourself, this book clarifies the issue in a point blank, straight from the hip fashion. In the end, you will agree with Gandalf that death is not the end, but a beginning, and perhaps not ""so bad"" as Pippin agreed in Return of the King. ***Amanda Killgore for Huntress Reviews."
2,Not Recommended,"This is a text book written for Paralegal's to give them a cursory overview of Elder Law. It is not a how to text, nor does it cover it's topics in any real detail. It is over priced (as text books often are) for the information it contains."
3,Rampant Elder Abuse and Fraud Colored by Law: Guardianship,"Get the real truth about the fraud and abuse of the elderly and not so elderly and read ""Retirement Nightmare"" by Diane Armstrong. To avoid a guardianship in the State of Florida, and other states, should be of paramount importance. Find out how to protect yourself and your loved ones with alternatives: health care surrogate, durable power of attorney, mediation and more. Consider that if you leave your parents to fend for themselves, and ignore the deterioration associated with aging, a guardian can gain a guardianship over them and their assets, without informing you. That guardianship will nullify the most meticulous of plans. To really cover your aging parents, make sure they create a ""Pre-need"" guardianship and name someone they trust, this is the only way predators in the retirement homes will not be able to force guardianship on them. Also create an irrevocable trust."
4,"Great sound, but...","Let me start by saying that this is a great system. I used to work for ALTEC/EVI pro audio, and, for the money, you really can't touch the sound this delivers. The sub, as noted by others, is wonderfully rich and never overpowers the rest of the system. The setup is a little complicated if you're not an audiophile, but it's not that hard, just read the instructions. The onscreen setup is OK, but not very user friendly. My only problem with the system is the DVD player, which ""upgrades"" the video signal to 480p, is only connectable through component cables. Why is there no HDMI connection to this unit? Less expensive (not as great sounding) systems come with an HDMI connection, H/K should step up the quality of the player in this boxed set. All in all, I'm happy with my purchase, I bought for sound/price, and the sound I am getting is wonderful, so I'm happy with that. If you are buying for picture quality, without going Blu Ray, this is not your system."
5,Great set,I've been using the 32 piece set for the past 5 years and I think these plates are great for everyday use. I ordered an additional 16 set because I was going to have more people over my house this past week. These plates are very durable and they look great at the same time. I even used them for our Christmas dinner and they looked fantastic.
4,Beautiful Set,I love the design of the dinnerware set and the color is perfect. I was very disappointed that one of the small plates was broken and by the time I realized it all of the other dishes were already unwrapped. Quality wise it seems just as good as an other set.
5,"A great alternative to Villeroy and Boch's ""New Wave"" pattern","I fell in love with the Villeroy and Boch pattern called ""New Wave"", but it seemed ridiculous to spend so much on dishes. This set is shaped similarly and looks just as nice. I got service for 8 for just over $60. The dishes do not scratch (like my previous Target set ""Worldview"") and are a nice size. Your food will look great on these plates, even if you're far from a gourmet chef."
3,"Nice set, but...","The actual dishes are great. They're attractive, slick, and hold a lot of food. Like another reviewer said, the bowls are perfect for anyone who scoffs at the official serving size for cereal and prefers to go a 'little overboard'.However, the company that shipped them to me could've done a bit of a better job. Two plates were broken, and I received no response from anyone when I tried to contact them about some sort of solution. The cost of shipping the whole set back as a return would've been more than the actual value of the broken dishes, so I kept what stayed intact and shrugged the disappointment off. Considering the price, it's still a fairly good bargain.Just the same, if anyone is considering these on the west coast, keep in mind that these ship from Florida or thereabouts, and have a long trip to make. Either invest in premium shipping (and ruin the great price on the set), or hope you're aren't in my unlucky minority."
5,Awesome and Complete Set,"I cant say enough about this set. The cups are the perfect hot beverage size. The dinner plates are big enough for any meal and I love the square shape. They are versitle and fit any style. They also fit perfectly in the dishwasher and they set straight up and do not fall over so I never need to re-wash. The salad plates are big enough for salads, desserts, appetizers or condiments. Bowls are great too!"
5,These are great!,"Bought 2 sets last year around Christmas. Still using them today as our everday dishes. They are fantastic. Good size, good weight. You can dress them up or dress them down. One of the best purchases made and you can't beat the price."
1,worst packaging ever!,How can you ship anything fragile via US mail with no bubble wrap? There was no attempt whatsoever to protect the product. Most of the shipment was broken. 2 of 4 plates were broken into tiny pieces. I can't blame the post office since they were thrown in the box without any protection of any kind. Buyer beware!
2,crack and chip very easily!,"I loved the way these plates looked; sort of like the ones my Grandparents had a long time ago. However, they crack and chip very easily! Also the plates are enormous; I use the side plates as my actual dinner plate because of that."
3,"Nice set, but not for everyone..","The set is nice and has the look of high quality, more expensive dining sets. The plates and bowls, however, were way too heavy for me. For someone who needed dishes for daily use, these were just too much.. too large and too heavy to manage. May leave them just for occasions or entertaining older family members. The only items that were OK for daily use were the mugs.Also, packaging was not good, especially for the salad dishes. One small plate arrived completely broken."
3,"Pretty standard dishes, look pretty good","The dishes are pretty nice. The bowls are very deep, which is fairly unique to this set; I like that... The coffee cups are rather standard and small. We left those in the box and use different cups. I gave this 3 stars because I expected something a little ""fancier"" (thinner plates, lighter, something). I wasn't upset enough to return the dishes though. I would say you could get this same set and quality from a walmart or something.** FOR THE BAD **I purchased two if these sets and one of the bowls was cracked. I intended to buy another full set as backup. I contacted the company (bargain to the people, I think) to ask about returning a single bowl or what they wanted me to do, but never received a response; I tried twice and it's been months now. So, I simply won't be buying a third set and I honestly feel a little jilted."
3,"nice shape, bad color, broken plate",I like the shape of these but they are not white. I wanted pure white dishes. A plate came broken. I'll probably use these for a little while and then get ones that are actually white and use these as extras when I'm too lazy to do dishes.
1,Poor Packaging,I love these plates but the packaging is very poor. We received four plates and one of them was broken in half. Very disappointing.
1,Broken,Gift for son. He liked. Arrived broken. Poorly packaged. Returned. No longer available from this vendor. Very disappointed No hassle on return tho
5,The book exceeded my expectations.,I have not gone through the whole book but the author can explain the concepts in simple ways that are easy to understand. Any extraneous material is not included or the reader is simply told to wait until it is covered later. He just sticks to the single point he is trying to convey.
2,Over-rated,"This book has been rather over-rated. It isn't really that well written, and the examples and explanations, though decent, aren't too well organised and chosen, at least to the eyes of a native Chinese speaker. I don't know if there're better books in the market, but this isn't entirely satisfactory."
5,great critical study of Japanese cinema,"It's a pity that this book is now out-of-print and only available from booksellers specializing in used books, because this is one of the essential works of criticism about the Japanese cinema. Sato is one of the finest critics to come from Japan; his very incisive comments are always thought-provoking and illuminating. As with all fine critics, he has his own perspective, and this can account for some very idiosyncratic views on certain films, but he's also powerful about the social contexts from which these films come. In this translation, the book is quite easy to read; in all, an excellent book for anyone interested in Japanese film."
5,great,great album good lyrics good vocals just good rock music the fist album WARHORSE is just like this one just great aldow this music is more then 30 jears old
4,The more that I listen to it.......,"The more I like it. This is a great album. I've owned it for about 6 months now, and I'm listening to it as I write this. She takes real risks with the material, and it all works beautifully. The version of ""Great Balls of Fire"" is incredibly sexy, but that's just the start. Her vocal and scatting on the hard-bop/free ""Slug it up"" is superb and contrasts brilliantly with ""Song for my Mother"", the last track on the album. This vocalist seems to be able to do it all with incredible ease and real wit. The backing band plays intelligently and with great sensitivity, and all seem to be extremely proficient improvisors in their own right.I rate this one at 4 stars because I save 5 stars for albums such as ""Kind of Blue"". This may be a bargain-priced album, but it's far better than many that I have paid 2-3 times as much for. Naxos does it again. I can't wait for her next album."
5,What a Voice... What a CD... What a Thrill!,"Barbara Sfraga can sing! She has a voice that will make you smile. It is sensual and exciting. Her rendition of ""Great Balls of Fire"" is hot. And she can write too! ""Song For My Mother"" is an original composition that will let you glimpse into her life. I loved everything on this CD. She has a permanent place on my CD player!"
4,It charges,"I took a guess on this charger because I didn't see my battery listed in its spec. I needed the charger to charge my Sony Cybershot DSC-W350 which has a Sony battery, NP-BN1. This charger is not made for that particular battery, HOWEVER, in a slot for a larger battery, the NP-BN1 can be placed there and will charge. The fit isn't tight, so you won't be able to move the charger without the battery falling out. Better to keep it on the floor or on a table. But IT WORKS, and the price was far lower than Best Buy. If you really need a charger, I'd recommend this one if you care only about the price and not a proper fit."
1,*sigh*,"Hey, I am Brazilian. Brazilian guidebooks on Brazil are lousy and package-tourist-who-hires-expensive-cars-oriented. So, I gave Let's Go a try - I used many of Let's Go guidebooks before.To say it shortly: rubbish. I come from Porto Alegre, a dull Southern city, with no beaches at all. Let's Go, nevertheless, calls it ""beachside beauty"". If I had used its maps to find my way, I would be lost in my own city and reappear in the seediest and dodgiest parts of it.Don't buy it."
2,Pretty good recommendations - but not much info,"I just returned from a four week trip around Brazil. I took this guide and the Moon Handbook of Brazil.This book gave pretty good restaurant recommendations. The hotels that were recommended were mainly for budget/student travelers, so we didn't use them much. The maps were good, thank goodness! However, the book didn't give much background information on the history or culture of the country. It was also lacking information on the northeast coast, which is where we spent most of our time.If you're looking for a real budget guide, this may be the book for you. I found it to be rather incomplete though."
3,Good but pricey,"I bought these for my son and he liked them. But after comparing prices with other brands, I have switched because they are really expensive. At first their subscribe and save price was a decent deal but they kept raising the price so I had to cancel since it was no longer reasonable."
3,Not my favorite flavor from Health Valley,"I ordered these after trying and liking Health Valley's chocolate toaster tarts and cinnamon danish pastry tarts. Both those other flavors are low fat and all, and are yummy.These strawberry cobbler cereal bars don't taste very much like strawberries and don't have any interesting cobbler flavoring. Very blah, but if you like Nutrigrain cereal bars you might like these ok."
3,The Sound Engineer(s) Should Be Shot...,"As previously mentioned, a DVD of Vic Damone - one of the truly GREAT American singers - is a rare find and, as he has apparently retired, a very collectable souvenir of this wonderful performer. This DVD, circa 1985, from England (where Mr. Damone is lovingly appreciated), presents a mature version of the Vic Damone, remembered from the forties' MGM musicals and the TV variety shows of the fifties, sixties and seventies. The Voice is Still There and, even with a cold, Mr. Damone is masterful - gliding majestically over some beautiful songs of yesteryear. Unfortunately, the sound is marred by poor recording equipment and technique, that interferes with the quality of this rare concert...regularly distorting the sound of both the singer and his adoring audience. Mr. Damone clearly deserves better as does his legion of fans."
5,fantastic singer,"to think this man had a cold, brilliant and showingno effort,the voice just flows out.vic damon andjohn gary ,never got the praise that was due to them.buy this dvd and your in for a treat."

4,Jonny..,I like this Video because it both eps are mostly on the kids. Jonny Quest fans deffently want this video. Besides The Alchemist it also has the Ep Assault On Questworld
4,"Good sequel to Slugs, but on a much larger scale.","The book itself is very similar to its prequel, Slugs. But, because of Hutson's fabulous method of writing horror the fact that this story is on a much larger scale, it is a fabulous read!!"
3,Nasty sequel to the garden variety monster yarn.,"Those pesky, slimey, disgusting garden pests have moved to the sewers of London. While they chow down on their unfortunate victims, their slime trails drive any and all that ingest them to violent madness. Lots of sex and violence with little plot to get in the way of the story, as good old boy Joe Bob Briggs so aptly put it. Fans of the first novel with no doubt find more of the same to enjoy here in this lightning paced read. For animal rampage buffs only."
1,"sorry, can't see the Hutson appeal","never before have I felt compelled to read the entire output of an author to find out why on earth people read it, I suppose renegades and shadows start inching towards originality, and if I ever have to answer the question 'what three books have changed your life the most and why?' I'd pick one of Hutson's, becuse he tries so hard to be gross and horrific but manages a horoeic faliure and becomes funny, and absolutely impossible to take seriously as horror."
2,Disappointed Grandson,The light does not light in the one end of the bumper so our grandson is disappointed to say the least. It was bought as a Christmas gift to go along with an O Guage trolley. Would love to have it replaced with a new set. Help.
2,Swanwick finally drops a dud. I guess it had to happen.,"I've loved every Swanwick book to date, and tracked down every short story of his I could find. I've evangelized his work to friends. But this book seemed to be completely lacking that ""magic"" that makes his writing so much more than typical science-fiction. And that's what's so shocking about ""Bones of the Earth"" -- that it's such a typical, moldy piece of sci-fi. I only made it through the first 4 chapters before losing interest completely, which is UNTHINKABLE in a Swanwick story! I'm talking wooden characters and dialogue, weak humor, a straining plot, and a profoundly uninteresting, beaten-to-death premise. I hope this is just an aberration in an otherwise stunning career."
2,I hoped for a lot more from this book,"There were some interesting ideas in this book but I just plain got bored. I couldn't figure out why the characters weren't worried about contamimating the Past and, when I did find out, it was like ""Gee, none of this matters!""Having realized this, I had absolutely no interest in the scientists ""marooned in the past"" storyline. I felt really disappointed."
2,Ho hum,"After a tantalizing opening, this novel quickly deteriorates: The characters have no depth; the dino theories are ridiculous (T Rex domesticating and herding stegos and other herbivores, commandeering them by means of infrasound); the elaborate time hopping adds no new insights or ideas to the existing time travel literature; and the ending is a major cop-out."
2,Baffling! Not a light read.,"Everyone has commented on how ""complex"" this book is. Well, it baffled me! I trudged through every chapter hoping it would get better. Instead I was bogged down in the mire of time travel that was taken as casually as changing one's socks(pop in, pop out). The same character was able to be in the same place at the same time & yet it was not a paradox. (How do you like your older self telling your younger self what to do?) It didn't seem to be leading anywhere. The only plot I understood was the creationist spy subplot. This book has a point in how far fanatics (of any kind) will go.Other than that, I consider this book so tied in knots that I am disappointed to have to say it was a waste of time & money for me. Maybe Sci Fi readers would like it. :("
4,Time is just another destination,"Creationism and evolution collide in this brilliant Sci Fi novel that will appeal to all fans of dinosaurs, time travel, and intelligent life forms. The movements of the earth are explored (over millennia), as well as music from unexpected sources. Interesting theories abound about the lives and evolutionary processes of dinosaurs and their eventual extinctions. While this is not quite light reading, it is not difficult either. It is well written, well arranged, and it flows in a comprehensible manner. If thought provoking and intelligent Sci Fi is your thing, I think you will like this one."
2,Save your money!,"I won't rehash the story as, by now, you have read a few of the other reviews. Yes, Swanwick is a well awarded author. Yes, it would appear he did his homework. But Good Lord, this is not a good book. The writing is poor - Swanwick needs to brush up on his syntax and should use a dictionary along with his thesarus, and the editing is spotty at best. The characters change personality more times than Sibyl, and I'm still unsure of the story line, even though I'm now 2/3 the way through the book.If you must buy this book, then wait until it shows up used somewhere at atleast half the original price. Otherwise, use your hard earned money to some better end."
2,What a disappointment,"Not up to the literary standards of ""Iron Dragon's Daughter."" Was really excited after reading the latter to discover a newish book by Swanwick with what I consider interesting subject matter. Reads more like a sloppy Michael Crichton without the suspense. Poorly plotted and full of inconsistencies, without a single character that I could care about."
1,Made it to page 87,"Normally I never give up on a book until at least 100 pages. This was an exception.The opening and first chapter seemed so promising! Then, in the second chapter, it fell apart with weirdness. Not one of the characters was is any way normal or likeable. The ""action"" was nonexistant. Worst of all, it started introducing lesbian characters, atheism and other unsavory content.I can honestly say I found nothing redeeming in this book. If it was supposed to have a message, it totally escaped me. I read several hundred books a year, and was bitterly disappointed in this lemon."
5,Excellent!,"If you're going to use VFP for more than casual GUI changes to your program, this book is a wealth of info. Concise, in-depth, and a lovely addition to your collection."
4,"Great quality, too high for sightline.","This collapsible stock is an excellent product when considering the quality and appearance. However, using the M4 stock on a paintball gun modeled after an H&K MP5 sub-machinegun does not work as the stock is too high for comfortable alignment of your eyes to the sights. If you can raise the line of sight with a red dot electronic sight or something of that nature then this accessory would be just fine. This stock does clear a 20 ounce tank."
2,its ok,i have been playing paintball for 7 years now and i puchesed this stock and although it dose provide grate suport it dose not allow you to look down the sights with your mask on and thins it a big problem when you are trying to snipe but if you are good at winging it and not useing a sight then go for it if not hold back and use your tank
1,Sucks,Ok I just got the stock and I started to put it on my gun following the instructions. But it won't work. It doesn't fit right. I haven't tried any of the other stocks but I'd say if they work then pay a little more for them. I'm gonna have to sand this one down until it will fit into my gun.
1,Piece of JUNK!,"I recently put one on my A-5 and after one day of shooting the pin joints busted off the stock. I ordered another one off amazon and figuring my original one was a bunk stock and I recieved it today... I put it on, fired maybe 20 shots before the joints blew again!!! I even had my air turned down really low.This thing looks good but its a waste of money."
2,It broke,"Had this on a p ball gun for a little while, didnt use it much and the stock broke near the gun body. Had to go buy a new one from a local shop, different brand name of course."
4,Her best,"This album is her best album to date but this CD does not include the slow version of The Wild One, like it was originally released in England and Scandinavia on LP back in 1974. Just for information ,the first track on this cd is single version of The Wild One."
4,"Trä -- Quirky, Wild, and Addictive","The 3rd album by Hedningarna, Trä, became their most celebrated and most popular. It features an all out vocal assault from not only the two Finnish singers (Sanna and Tellu) but also by the men as well on Min Skog, Räven, and VargTimmen. Instrumentally, the band combines their unique Scandinavian folk sound with modern rock production and instrumentation.While the album does contain some of the band's strongest (and most lovingly bizarre) material -- Tuuli, Räven, Täss'on Nainen, and Tina Vieri to name a few -- some of the tunes don't really quite catch fire. It was certainly a groundbreaking album but I don't believe it is their best; Karelia Visa accomplishes that in a more sublime, mature way.But this album still delivers the heathen roots/rock that makes this group so wonderful -- its a quirky, wild and addictive ride. Certainly worth owning."
5,Best album of the 90s?,"This is tremendous stuff. From the stealthy opening rhythms of Tass O Nainen to the breathtaking climax of the final track Tiina Vieri there isn't a wasted moment. It's visceral, haunting, earthy, delicate, erotic, violent and ecstatic: music for non-robots. The close-interval vocal harmonies and the harsh drones of the bagpipes and hardingfele may not be Easy Listening but they are full of real life and ideas. Tra still seems as fresh today as it did in 1994, so for me it has now achieved the status of indispensable classic. In fact it's the cream of a rich crop of Nordic ""Folk Under Influence"" that takes traditional themes, rhythms and instruments, and injects a fierce energy while remaining firmly attached to its roots. Breton musicians were doing something similar in the early seventies but this is a superb antidote to the unimaginative power-chord folk-rock we've had so much of since then. Magnificent."
3,"Poor, poor Cassiopeia...","Yes, the chart is weather proof which is very nice, and it's easily folded to only reveal the season in which you are viewing the night sky; however, I am saddened by the names it seems Klutz has chosen to give the constellations. Cassiopeia, a well known constellation, is referred to (disturbingly) as ""W or M"". Neither the story of her being 'hung' in the sky nor her lovely name are even alluded to. Canis Minor is labeled ""Hot Dog"" and includes a drawing of a hot dog using the stars that make up the constellation. Poor Orion! His smaller dog is now a tasty treat sold curbside in New York. Beautiful Pegasus is referred to as ""Baseball Diamond""! I have only mentioned the constellations of the Winter sky. I am going to stop there. I think you get the idea. Yes, the constellations that are diagrammed are easy to find, but it truly makes me sad to see that many of their real names are not even mentioned in this chart."
4,boxy but good,"This book is intended primarily for serious students of history. It discusses the foundations of historical research--what kinds of questions do historians ask, what constitutes evidence, what makes a source reliable, and the epistomology that underguards historical inquiry. The language is somewhat dense at times and examples are frequently pulled from European history, a not always felicitous choice for students of American history. Still, the reader leaves the book with an arsenal of questions that he can use in tackling his own research questions or in critiquing the work of others. I am still searching for the brief handbook that will provide the amateur historian with a guide towards writing honest, vital, and accurate local histories. To the best of my knowledge, it does not exist."
2,Remedial Historiography 101,"This book would work well for an undergraduate Historical Methods class, but is fairly remedial and omits much in covering a broad swath while including superfluous chapters. Assessing validity of source material is such a basic enterprise that I was shocked to see a chapter on it, but nothing on the Frankfurt School. No book can please everyone, but this is REALLY a basic primer into source analysis and themes in historiography. Adding insult to injury, the book is structured in outline form, which makes it as engaging as a staff meeting or a lecture, but at least you can skim."
2,What a mess!,"We purchased this for use at the office where it gets moderate daily use. Upon opening the package, there was toner dust everywhere. I spent most of the morning cleaning up toner.This in NOT a Dell brand toner. Staples now carries authentic Dell toner cartridges.Recommendation: Not worth the hassles... buy a Dell brand cartridge"
5,Safely in the ground!,"My granddaughter (five years old) and I planted these together. We used theJiffy 5032 Professional Greenhouse 25-Plant Starter Kitand planted five of the little peat pellets with these seeds. Not only did every one of the pellets produce seedlings, but I counted a sixth pot as well. I suspect little fingers managed to drop some of the seeds in the extra pellet. As they grew, I transferred them into peat pots and placed them in my sunroom.I spent a couple of days hardening them outside, and they are now happily growing in our garden. Every single plant is doing well, and any progress from this point on will depend upon the soil, the sun, the rain,and whatever pests decide to attack. I was very pleased with the germination rate of these, and the healthy plants that appeared as a result.This is my first experience in growing from seed, and I have been overwhelmed by the success rate of these."
4,Died in infancy,"The soil was prepared, the containers readied, the lights placed and the seeds planted. The little sprouts appeared in May along with varieties of vegetables in several containers. And then, after about three weeks they all died. I am sure it was something in the soil and will use the rest of the seeds for next years batch & hope for a better result. I give the rating this year as the sprouts did appear and began to grow. I think their demise is due to my lack of developed horticultural skills."
3,Fair read,"It's a fair read, I recommend it for students doing projects or assignments on the subject matter. Also, the introduction was pretty good IMO"
5,Clamshell Portfolio,The item was as depicted and accurately described. It arrived in a timely fashion after ordering. The price was reasonable.
2,Pretty marginal work,"I didn't dislike it and I didn't like it. There's a lot the author tries to cram in a limited amount of pages--that's part of the problem. Another problem that I had with book is that it that the interaction between characters was a touch contrived. While the exisentence of God, faith, etc. are all interesting issues, I'm not sure why there is a need to repeat the same philosphical arguments over and over, just with different characters. Further, Kerebos is presented as the ultimate evil, a killer of children, men and women alike, and yet he takes the time out to engage in a philosophical debate about God, faith, etc.?I had higher expectations for the book."
5,"Sparse, but mesmerizing","...I did not find the translation poor. If anything, thetranslator did an amazing job of rendering Serbo-Croatian into Englishin such a way that I would venture to guess that the emotional impactof the original language has been preserved. The writing is sparse. There are few adjectives used and the sentences are short. This makes for a very emotionally tough read--your imagination is forced to deal with the acts taking place. They are not prettified. They are raw. They are powerful. They force you to think about the ugliness that is inflicted upon these women.What's interesting is that S. makes two choices in this book that others may have had serious problems with. In order not to give anything away, I won't talk about them here, but by making the choices that she does she is able to have some agency over her victimhood.I have been haunted by this book for days. It will stay with me forever."
5,Brutally true,I rate this on a par with A Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovitch and Primo Levy's Survival in Auschwitz. I've just spent 15 minutes trying to elaborate on that praise; I cannot.
4,Very good read,"This novel was recommended to me by my daughter, who had to read it in one of her womens' studies courses in college. Now, before that scares you off, this is a very engrossing read. I've recommended it to several of my friends and family members and they all agreed that it was a very good book. It really helped illuminate the real toll of the Balkins wars for me."
5,Amazing waves everytime!,Love this waver! Best iron I've ever owned and it works great on both short and long hair! I always have people asking me what I used to get this look!
5,Who knew Christian music could be this much fun!,"Christian music these days seems to be something that people love to deem as boring or repetative. Anyone who becomes big take on this ""rock-star""status which is contrary to what Christian music is all about. This Train provides us with a unique, fun, witty, fast-paced alternative to the same old thing. If you love seing, rockabilly, surfer, or punk music, you are garaunteed to love this album. it is COMPLETELY original and real."
5,Fantastic Christian Message with an Upbeat Rocakbilly Vibe.,"Mark Robertson and Comapany let there brilliance shine through on the latest release from This Train. Each track is laced with so much Christian positivity and energy that you can't help but like these guys. Anyone who can write a beautiful song like ""Goodbye"" and then crank one out like the hilarious ""Mimes of the Old West"" is a genius in my book. The playing on the cd is first rate and the writing is also great. The bands comic ability also shows through on ""We're going nowhere (fast)"" which was written after having dinner with Dc Talk. The song contains hysterical lines like ""sure we ain't as cute as Toby, Mike or Kevin.""There is also an excellent cover of the Hank Williams classic ""I Saw the Light."" This cd is the total package."
3,"Great drawings, but...","neat drawings, but this book is for hard-core fans of Morphosis. the amount of graphic information enclosed is staggering at first, but once you own it you will get bored with it. there is no meat on these bones. the text, tellingly placed in the back like an afterthought,is meaningless. i doubt anyone without prior experience with Morphosis' projects would really understand what he is up to."
2,Graphic design - not architecture!,"As with the previous two volumns in the Morphosis Building and Projects series, this book emphasizes graphics, not architecture. It is difficult, if not impossible to understand the concepts indicated in the computer generated images. Very few actual photos of buildings. The text is also very complex and seems to attempt to discuss issues deeper than any of the designs seem to achieve. I own all three volumnes and this is by far the poorest. I continue to hope that a better product will be produced showcasing Morphosis. No insight is gained from this book - only pure frustration. Look elsewhere for fresh architectural ideas - you will not understand these!"
5,Design masterpiece,"One of the few architecture books at the brick and mortor bookstore that isn't sealed shut with shrink wrap. After I flipped through it I immediately bought it through amazon. It is designed by Cranbrook design superstar Lorraine Wild, the design perfectly represents what Morphosis is about. I take it from the other reviewers that they only looked at the images and did not read anything at all because they did not ""get it"". Their work is delivered as a cyberpunk novel outtake, the setting an industrial dance club with torture devices. There is a wonderful surreal short story that acts as a sort of guide to viewing the work as well. I am not an architect but this is inspirational enough for me to spend half a decade in school to become one. Reminds me of the Jean Tinguely book published in the early 70's (with sketch overlays) and a similar design philosophy as Low/Tek"
5,HEALING LEAVES IS MEDICINE FOR THE SOUL,"Prescriptions for Inner Strength, Meaning and Hope is the perfect subtitle for this gem of a book. Small in size, Healing Leaves brings forth the wisdom of the beloved Rebbe Noson on a very personal yet universal level. This is the perfect book to keep by your bedside and refer to again and again. Rebbe Noson, the scribe of Rebbe Nachman has something for everyone in this book. It's just the thing to turn to when you are looking to create balance in your life."
4,Great casters but not as described.,"These are great, low friction casters that make my 400lb band saw roll easily. There are no bearings, unless you stretch to meaning of the term to include a steel bushing. I didn't really expect actual bearings at this price anyway, but the description should reflect that. Having made that complaint, it's really amazing that casters can roll this easily compared to the old hard rubber style."
4,Nice Medium Duty Caster,"The swiveling caster is mounted on bearings around the vertical axis. It moves smoothly and without difficulty. On both the swiveling and fixed versions, wheels rotate on their axle without bearings but on the nylon or plastic wheel center. Although no bearings here, wheel still has reasonable rotation. Don't overload, but should be fine for carrying weights of up to, perhaps, 30 lbs and perhaps a bit more."
4,Good Value for the price,"These casters are of decent quality, in fact very good for the price. The wheels are a little narrower than higher priced casters, so will not carry real heavy loads without indenting soft wood flooring. But for light duty they work fine."
3,Alcohol taste permeates flavor,"Unbelievably powerful - a few drops will completely flavor a small amount of food, liquid, ect. The problem is the overbearing alcohol aftertaste when a lot is used. I had to compromise using some butterscotch syrup and this to get a full butterscotch flavor without the aftertaste"
3,"Good caster, but not too practical","I bought these casters because we had tool stands that already had single holes in them, and I thought we could just put the shaft through the hole, secure it with a nut, and away we'd go. However, where the tool rests is on a fixed nut at the bottom of the shaft, so the tool is resting on a very small base that's actually quite high off the ground. This makes these casters unsuitable for really heavy tools, despite the fact that the casters themselves are very sturdy, and the shafts are strong. I would recommend buying the version that has a flat base that fastens on with several bolts, rather than this one."
5,Casting Call,"I recently purchased a steel HDTV stand from a well known company. The optional set of four caster wheels, only two of which locked, was priced exceedingly high. The casters from Grizzly were perfect for this application. I installed four locking swivel casters and saved myself 80% by doing so. The locks engage and disengage so smoothly and easily, that I can do this in bare feet. Great deal, quality item. Grizzly saved me a real good chunk of change."
3,Grampa was a Mexican hippy!,"A sort of Mexican coming of age tale with two cousins on a mission to scatter their roguish grampa's ashes in Acapulco where they find out he had a secret second family. Complications ensue. Lovely scenes of Mexico City and Acapulco that defy stereotypes. Are these places really this nice? I hadn't thought so. Above average, though predictable."
3,Ok,"I purchased the DVD because of the high reviews, but I didn't find it very entertaining. Watched it twice and fell asleep both times. Maybe too much on the drama side for me. Cute guys, but the director is careful not to show you much."
5,wonderful!,"D.W.Griffith was a master, and here is jet another masterpiece. Most people don't realize that films (flickers at they were named at first) were laughed at, and thought of as cheap low grade entertainment, until D.W.Griffith came on the scene with ""A Birth of a Nation"". That was the beginning of the film industry as we know it today. All his works are original, and many try to show man's inhumanity to man. The uneducated think he is racist because he shows racism, in fact he bares racism for all to see, as well as many other human faults. Don't pass up a D.W.Griffith film. You must see them all to appreciate the man."
1,Silly,"I can't decide which is more preposterous, D.W. Griffith or his persistent substantial reputation. Obviously, no one has bothered to look at his films, otherwise their ridiculous 19th-centuiry theater mentality would be universally reviled. Birth of a Nation couldn't be shown to a modern audience without several provisos. Otherwise it would quickly provoke a race riot. And it's interesting how quickly the much-touted accomplishments of Griffith were surpassed by his contemporaries. By the time he made America, he had been left so far behind by other filmmakers that he began his famous slide into well-deserved obscurity."
5,Simply powerfuland breathtaking!,"This book will change your life! Through the most beautiful and poignant messages from souls across time this book, really two works in one, challenges you to acknowledge your magnificence. It was the first time I truly thought about how important it is to love and celebrate myself. I have found myself using the book almost daily for guidance. It is full of wisdom about life, spiritual truth, and our experience as souls on earth. I love it and have already told many friends to read it."
5,The Spiritual Fast Track!,"The Song of Souls resonated throughout my being as testimony to the fact that love is the key to All. My recognition of the song and internalization of it's message has been the key to my 'fast track' spiritual unfoldment. This book is a must read for anyone who wants to know how and where to find answers to life's greatest questions. But if you want to find out, you've got to read the book! :-)"
5,eathreal bliss in a zen moments,I thoroughly enjoyed it with headphones on I felt cleanzed from the inside out this is great with peppermint tea on a thin cushion on the floor with the lights out Blessed be Lar
2,this has the wrong title on the book!,"This 220 pages book is on scanning using ultrasound as the medium and has nothing to do with the basic explanation of Ultrasound. The author(s) hardly devoted the time and the explantion of the principles on the Ultrasound. The title ""Basic Ultrasound""is a misnomer. I am truly disappointed after [buying] this book."
5,i havent read the book yet but i hope its good,hey i read one of the reviews for this book from one of the readers actually the Becoming is not going to be the last book in the DOTM series lynne ewing is actually writing another one which is book 13 and is about Vanessa and she is going to be doing more in the future so whoever said the becoming is the last book theyre wrong there is a book 13 coming out soon.
1,$12 for 1 bolt!!!!,"I am returning the 1 bolt I purchased simply because their product ad says for 10 pieces and I was okay with pay $12 for 10 bolts, since we needed 3, but since we only got 1 then I will be returning it for a refund and looking somewhere else."
5,Time to Get this transferred to a DVD,As the other reviewers indicate-an excellent Kirk Douglas Western! It's time to get thisonto a DVD. Combining it with Along the Great Divide and/or the Big Sky wouldmake a great package
4,Man without a star,"I thought this was a good movie with alot of substance towards its story. It stars Jeanne Crain as a young, unmarried girl without much experiance in the world. I reccmommend it only if you don't mind the overacting thats seen alot in old, dramatic movies."
5,Pump and Circumstances,"Fantastic book on the Service stations across the United States that earned the term ""Service"". This book is highly recommended to anyone who restores gas pumps or just loves the era when gas pumps were more than just that! Lots of beautiful and helpful photos.""THAT DAMN JOHNNY'S TEXACO AND COLLECTABLES"""
1,Don't waste your money!,"After trying the Namaste pizza crust I was blown away--Delicous! Possibly, the best pizza crust I've ever had. So, I tried their Cheez Pasta thinking it would be great as well. Big surprise. It was awful. I could barely tolerate one bite of it. I, like one of the other reviewers, will save the pasta but make my own cheese sauce. The cheese sauce smelled and looked terrible. Do not waste your money on this product!"
2,"We've tried many vegan, gluten-free mac and 'cheese' varieties, this isn't the best.","My other half and I have tried a lot of vegan, gluten-free mac and cheese varieties and this one is just okay. It tastes more like buttered noodles than mac and cheese. The ingredients are fine, the pasta itself is good and cooks evenly, the preparation is easy enough but it contains silicon dioxide (sand) and is more expensive and not as tasty as Leahey Gardens gluten-free and vegan macaroni and cheese. If you like this more than Leahey Gardens... I'm interested to hear about it."
5,Delicious!,"I bought this because I am vegan and not because the product is gluten-free. The only other vegan Mac n' cheese substitute I have found/ tried are the Roads End products. My husband is hard to please when it comes to vegan cheese, and he hated the Roads End stuff but loved this. I do too--it's way better than Roads End stuff. It has a delicious flavor that is not at all spicy. Also much easier to mix up than the Roads End.Not that expensive at all. I'll definitely be buying more. Love it!Btw the people adding tuna and chicken are missing the point of eating a vegan meal!"
5,"Not mac-n-cheese, but very good.","My daughter has a severe allergy to dairy, so we have tried a couple of products, trying to get close to macaroni and cheese. This was very easy to prepare, and while there wasn't a creamy sauce, the spice packet was very tasty. My picky but food-allergic 5-year-old, as well as my husband and I, really enjoyed this product. I got online today specifically to order this product."
1,Garbage.,"Don't waste your time. The construction seems traditional, but the boot is extremely poor quality in terms of craftsmanship and materials. When I unpacked them they were attracting lint particles in a way I've never seen and the odor coming from the boot wasn't a leather smell, but a rather unpleasant rubber smell... like a really old tire, or something treated with chemicals. The so-called leather sure didn't feel like leather and I was too disgusted to even try them on. I've owned more than several pairs of Engineer boots over the last 30 years and these are the worst I've ever seen, although by today's low, low standards with everything made in China I'm sure you could do worse than these boots from Carolina. Just ordered the Chippewa steel toe Engineer and its eligible for free return if they are bad, but somehow I get the feeling the Chippewa's will be better than this. This Carolina boot is the first item I've ever returned and the first 1 star review I've ever submitted."
4,good vendor coverage,"I had no idea a book on firewalls could be this big! The authors have striven to write a definitive Handbook (in the German sense of the word). It spans every major implementation, circa 2003 - Cisco, Nokia, Solairs, linux,... Which explains a substantial part of the heft. The firewall market has these major platforms, and there is enough detail on each for you to be able to install and run it.But the book is more than a set of disparate sections on each vendor. More broadly, it goes into the theory of Intrusion Detection Systems and the common ideas behind most firewalls. You should note that the IDS topic alone is considered sufficiently important by others to have books devoted to it. The level of detail in this book about IDS is not the most comprehensive. But you'll get the gist.So within the covers of this book, you are getting a broad scope of product information and theory. Even if the book's title is somewhat strident."
1,Misleading product description,"The Product Description reads:""...The Second Edition of the Best Damn Firewall Book Period is completely revised and updated to include all of the most recent releases from Microsoft, Cisco, Juniper Network, SonicWALL, and Check Point...."".I bought this book to get a flying start with my SonicWall TZ-170. Contrary to the product description, it does NOT cover SonicWall AT ALL. So, to understate, the product description is misleading. For me, the book is close to useless, a total waste of money. Get the product description updated, please."
1,Another Damn Firewall Book comma,"Another firewall book commahas lots and lost of information, none of which is definitiveDo yourself a favor and purchase something more precise to the firewall your trying to implement, such as the the Umer kahn book about cisco pix, or any of the other numerous titles that cover more specific ideasbuying this book is like buying The Best Damn Cookbook when your lookin for a book on baking cookies (period)overly presumptuous, grossly incomplete, less then definitive, can you tell im bored (period)"
3,"Good, but not the best.","This is a good book, but certainly not the best.Check out Damean Welch-Abernathy's book on Firewall-1 for the really best book."
3,Pretty small...,"Not really worth the trouble of using it to make one cup of tea.... Yes, I know it states the size in the ad. Wishful thinking on my part, clearly I'm no genius...when it comes to fill volume..."
3,"Small, decorative, and can be hot to manage.","You get about one cup of tea out of it. If it is on the fireplace heating plate for a while the handle and lid are too hot to handle without protection. Because the lid top nub is small, this could be a problem for some.I do not find it practical for making tea but it looks good on the fireplace heating plate."
2,not so good,"Although the shipping is quick. However, I think the teapot is lighter than they described. It stated that the shipping weight is 13 pounds. So I think maybe the teapot will be about 9 or 10 pounds. Actually it is much lighter than I imaged. The pot is about 4 or 5 pounds. I think it is so bad to lie to customers. If I knew the truth, I would not buy it because a teapot, a trivet and two cups are totally about 35 dollars in the Farmers supermarket."
2,Bone-A-Mints,My dog will eat these but they are kind of difficult for his little teeth. He is still excited by the smell and equates them with Greenies.
2,Metal Band Saw Blade,"Worst $12.00 I've ever spent. This blade didn't even cut through one piece of light metal. Made a dent into it and that was it, dull. All the set was knocked off of the blade. Useless piece of metal is all it is. Better off buying a few hacksaw blades and doing the job with them."
5,Vermont American metal bandsaw blade,The new blade was delivered quickly after the order. The blade fit my saw exactly as described. Subsequent use of the saw to cut stainless steel decorative 'bricks' was smooth and easy.
3,Careful of the weight !!!,"While the overall construction of these mounts is pretty good, the weight rating is questionable. I tried to use these with MK LCR950's which were near the 20 lb. mark and they simply didn't work. The speakers put too much of a load on the ball to get it to clamp properly. They were also not easily adjusted, since the plastic ball was deformed once clamped and making a minor adjustment was no longer possible. I did use the ceiling mount version for the smaller siblings to these speakers and they worked fine. Other review recommending derating these by 50% is probably pretty accurate."
4,excellent for heavy speakers,"This was perfect for my b&w 13lb rear speakers.. very adjustable, solid, sturdy, and mount well to my plaster board ceiling with appropriate anchors."
5,Great Speaker Mount,I used this mount to suspend rear speakers in my home theater system. The speakers weigh 10lbs so this mount was more than adequate. The quality is better than I expected. Easy to install and adjust. This mount provides a very secure mount that should stay put. I recommend these.
5,Good for your digestion.,"Psyllium husk is the active ingredient to metamucil, good to avoid constipation and the nastier ailments (like diverticulitis) that can come with it. One can take only so much metamucil as a drink, and while psyllium husk is available in bulk, it gets pretty boring stirring it into juices and smoothies, etc.Capsules are a handy form, just take them with your meds or vitamins, or with your meals."
1,"Save your money, not even worth a starter guitar","This was probably the worst product I've ever purchased from Amazon. The neck was warped. I gave it as a gift to a friend that just wanted a cheap guitar as a starter. The strings touched the neck before trying to tune due to being badly warped. Save your money, and purchase another guitar."
2,Happy to support a local group BUT...,"...overall I was unimpressed.Maybe it needs a different producer or mixer.It was just ""off"""
5,Knife reviver,"I found a box full of old, blunt, but high quality kitchen knives. In about 5 minutes, I had resharpened all these knives and saved more than the price of the stone for not having to buy a new set!"
1,Product was not as described!,"I received this book today, and disappointed by the condition! I would have rated this book as ""Poor"" and NOT ""Good"" as described! I will be returning this book! Please rate your book accurately!"
5,YUM!,"I first bought Health Valley granola at Fresh Fields years ago.Then Whole Foods carried it for several years. Now it has becomenearly impossible to find at any local super market.I am something of a granola connoisseur, but don't like thehigh fat, high calories in some of the other brands.Health Valley is low in fat, has the calories under control (190 2/3c.),and taste great! Yes, it is sweet, but the sugar is somewhatlow concidering the sweet taste. 5g protein, 10g of sugar, and6g of fiber that taste like dessert, keep my waiste line in check,and my system flowing regularly. I mix mine with yogurt in the morning.Taste like dessert for breakfast.YUM!"
5,A FUNNY LITTLE BOOK ON A TOUGH TOPIC,"Laughter helps give you perspective and anyone going through a divorce can use all the perspective (and all the laughs) she can get. This book will make you laugh out loud. Often. Get it for yourself, or for anyone you care about who is floundering through one of life's worst experiences."
4,Good Book on Witchcraft Tools,"I can only say that I bought this book at a used book shop, in the 90s and it has been one of the favorite books which I have been reccomending for years. This book shows you how to make witchcraft tools using the old Celtic method. Excellent techniques of metal working LOL (you will understand why I laugh when you read it) I only wish I could find the group in Georgia who the author is supposed to be worshipping with, I have some questions."
5,The Slander Continues,"I have been patient with the slanderous reviewers of this book. But since I wrote it I feel I have an obligation to reply to the BS which has been placed on this section of Amazon. Certain disatisfied individuals who were asked to leave our church for various infractions of ethics and honor and then resigned have stated they are going to ""get me"". This slander is one of the various ways they have chosen to do so. But they didn't sign their name. Their claims are in fact blatant lies and fabrications in an attempt to hurt me financially, emotionally, and in any way they can. These are in fact very evil people who will stop at nothing to hurt others. But, they crossed the line when they slandered me and lied about my religion.The 13 Mystical Treasures has been a best seller and that bothers them. These slanderous and self serving remarks are an attempt to hurt the sales of the book. Please don't be fooled by these people."
5,Great Book,"I attended Rhuddlwm Gawrs classes in the 70s and early 80s. I found him to be a very honorable person as can beproved by the Website that contains some of his teachings. I traveled to Wales and met some of his Dynion Mwynteachers. Later my spiritual path diverged and I ended up going more toward druidism. BUT I can say this abouthis books with no reservation. He is honest, considerate and (too) trusting of a teacher. He may not care whatothers say about him, but I say that all those who attack him and do not want you to read his books are falseprophets only concerned that people will call them liars if you read his books.This book tells a wonderful story of initiation. It will change your life as it did mine. Yes I am a Fan. His books changed my life for the better. Thank you Rhuddlwm for your wonderful integrity and conscience."
5,Love the description of making a Sword,"Excellent portrayal of tool making for Welsh Witchcraft. This book is causing a great hubub in Welsh Pagan circles only because it has been mentioned by pagans who want to be known as the be all of Welsh Paganism. They don't want a yank to be known as a Welsh Witch, so they have inlisted the help of neo-wales extremists who invent e-mail addresses and keep trashing the author. Not the book mind you. The book is great. The book is true. And how would I know? Because until last week I was loosely associated with this bonkers group. They have become nasty and obsessed and totally bonkers. The book is Great. The author is honest. The time is right."
1,sad,where on earth did this authr get these ideashe seems to know his witchcraft okbut he hasnt got a clue about walesnever been here probablythere are much better and intelligent books written about paganisn and they dont resort to lying to get membersmae'n rhaid dweud nad oes gan hwn yr un syniad am ein gwlad
1,silly,a very dangerous man who is being investigated by the police for illegal activities. one welsh girl had to get police protection. he threatened to send videos of her to her family. videos taken without her knowledge at Camelot - william wheelers home. Get involved at your peril.
2,"good for a couple of, years then they leak","Great looking, nice shape and holds alot. We bought these cups for daily use. We have had them for two years and one by one they are starting to leak at the seam at the bottom. Appearance wise they still look as good as when we bought them, but i never expected plastic cups to leak. They were always cleaned in the dishwasher."
2,"Good, but grossly overdone","This book made it point in the first 3 chapters. They also add useless software to drive the price up. Their coverage of basic marketing and the 4 P's is done ok but the book just drags on and on. Their readable examples are great. What they need is minimal theory, lots of examples and NO SOFTWARE in a 200 page book for $19.95. Then this would be a good book."
2,Horrible to read,"This book is horrid to read, the chapters drag on and there simply too much information crammed into one chapter. Its hard to differentiate the points in the chapters, and many of the important points are not emphasized."
2,basic marketing,Rec'd it yesterday. Do not recall ordering the international version but that's what I got. and it does not have the cases that Walden University requests essays.I wanted 16e 2008. I thought I clicked that one and put in cart. I thought wrong.The chapters are the same but the cases are not.
3,Not the best...,"Nature's Way is a highly respected name in nutritional supplements. I do not doubt the quality of this product. However, although the serving size is three capsules, the recommended daily intake is three capsules up to three times a day. The capsules are a little large and so if you are taking other supplements or medications, you may feel like you are popping lots of pills... And in this case, you will be!"
5,i do the dummy retarded and ride yellow bus!,"first, lemme yell at the person who rated this a 3 star...your from st. louis, MO....so, go back and listen to your nelly cd's!da baydestrian is nothin less than 5 stars point blank its one of his best albums"
5,SOLID,"THIS WAS A VERY SOLID REALEASE. AWESOME PRODUCTION, GREAT HYPHY BEATS...AND HIS LYRICS ARE MUCH BETTER THAN I THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE. WHEN I FIRST HIM ON THE RADIO I THOUGHJT HE WAS JUST ONE OF THOSE MAC DRE WANNABES, AND HAVE THAT LIL JON VIRUS (HARD BEATS, HORRIBLE LYRICS). BUT I WAS WRONG, HE HAS SOME DECENT LYRICS AND WORDPLAY. THE BEATS WERE TIGHT FROM START TO FINNSH. IF YOU HAVE SUBWOOFERS THAN THIS ALBUM WILL HAVE YOU VIBRATING THE NEIGHBORHOOD. I HAVEN'T HEARD ANY OF HIS OTHER ALBUMS OR HIS OTHER MIXTAPE STUFF BUT IT MUST BE PRETTY GOOD. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ALL BAY AREA PEEPS OR ANYONE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THATS SOUNDS DIFFERENT."
5,Works great,Used these to ceiling mount Definitive technology Mythos Gems and they work great and look great.
2,DO NOT WASTE YOUR $: Craps out in 1 to max 3 years,"Initially, I was happy with this gadget. Then I realized the syncing issues for the windows software machine - songs have to have a certain way of tagging, not very user friendly. But I got past that and was enjoying the device till one day (2.5 yr mark) it completely stopped turning on. Can't seem to find much support for it online."
1,Really poor quality,"Very happy for the 1st 3 weeks and then problems started to occur.I put it in my back pocket of my pants and I guess my walking around while listening to it caused some kinda of warping (but MP3 players are built to stand some warping, right?). First the screen died so I can only use the buttons to navigate to play the music. Then the battery would suddenly discharge for no obvious reasons. Now (3 months from the date I made the purchase) the whole player doesn't even work any more.I am frusrated but I can't return it since I bought it in the US and relocated to Asia.Don't buy it!"
3,Good player but battery is not replaceable by user,"I purchased this p[layer after reading the CNET review which gave it high marks. It is indeed easy to use, small, attractive, and performs nicely. But, and this is a BIG but, the player has both a short battery cycle life, and to replace the battery, it must be returned to Toshiba. I called Toshiba to find out the price for battery replacement and I was told that the flat rate price is $140.00. I almost dropped the phone. As I recall, a big complaint with the the first generation I Pod was that the battery also had to be sent to the factory for replacement for $99.00. I Pod users revolted and so Apple changed the design. So how can Toshiba, five years later, make a player that does not allow for field replacement, and why should battery replacement cost so much??? Needless to say, I have returned the player to Amazon and I plan to purchase a Zen Vision instead."
1,do not buy,"i recently purchased this item from electronics expo through amazon. the product is defective and stopped working after 1 week. i contacted the number on my receipt, and was given false information, then tried to recontact and could not get an answer or got a recording that the number is not in service. i'm out 217 hard earned dollars. do not buy from these people."
1,Do not buy gigabeat. battery life is only 6 hour long.,i bought this about a month ago. i realized that battery last only 5~6 hours. i looked up many of the reviews online before i bought. i believed that battery life is 12 hours as it is described in the review. WRONG. it last only 5 hours and it is freaking annoying. don't buy this. get ipod. i wish i can return this and get ipod instead.
1,Owned 3 months - Returned Twice!,This product is not what I expected. I had to return the 1st Gigabeat the day I received it from Amazon. Software issues. I just returned my second to Toshiba because of battery life issues. It would get only 4 hrs of play time or would die if disconnected from the charger for 4 hrs.This piece of garbage does not live up to the hype!
4,Love it!!,The battery button is so small I knocked off a star. Otherwise I love the player.It is perfect because I love drag and drop. I also use Napster to Go with XM Radio. It is great.I returned our two Christmas Zunes. They were nice but don't use Play for Sure. Didn't know that before they were purchased. Unbelievable that Microsoft's own product (Zune) isn't compatible with their own Media Player. Shame on Microsoft!
5,Gigabeat + Rhapsody To Go = Death of the IPOD,This product is absolutley fabulous. I have had it for about four months now and I cant put it down. I have the Rhapsody To Go service which grnats me unlimited songs along with great album art. I couldn't be happier with this product. I had an IPOD before this and I now relize how over-rated the IPOD is. If you are considering and Ipod I strongly suggest that you reconsider because this product is better. IPOD may have all of the accesories and have ITUNES but ITUNES sucks and is expensive. IPOD=$$$$$$$$. If you think you wont be able to get the variety of videos that ITUNES has you are wrong. It is the first mp3 player compatible with Vongo a service that sells big name movies for your player at a low cost.
2,Gigabeat battery,"I purchased the Gigabeat after reading the reviews about this unit being the ""ipod killer"".First, what I don't like about the unit. The battery, the battery, the battery! If apple can make a battery life on the IPOD that last 20 hours, why can't other manufacturers?The first week I got the Gigabeat the battery lasted 5 hours, then 4, then 2. Now it doesn't turn on. I had to send back to Toshiba for repair. I am not happy.Where are the accessories? How can you beat the iPOD without accessories?Price - If you want to beat the king you have to be better than the king especially in price.In operations. If you are not careful you can delete all the music on the player.Now here is the good: The unit sounds great, nice size screen, works well with Media Player, easy to use.The bottom Line: This is not an ""iPod killer"". I should have gotten an IPOD!!"
1,STAY AWAY FROM THIS ITEM!!,"Battery life is absolutely atrocious. I have had the battery replaced twice, and still I have less than 2 hours battery life. And when the battery drains, all music/photos stored on the internal hard drive are gone....have to reload from a PC. Worst product I ever bought."
3,toshiba support Rating should be 1 star,My entire family has IPOD's and I chose to go with Toshiba gigabeat. Up to now I have been happy with it other than the battery life is not very good. The battery will die even if you aren't using the gigabeat. My biggest problem is finding Toshiba support for this model. I called an 800 number given to me by another toshiba division and was told that they don't support the older models. They gave me another number which is not Toshiba and they said for 74.95 they will upgrade but I have to send it to them. I had tried to sync a digital copy of a dvd movie that allowed you to download to IPOD or your PC and to any other portable player. won't sync to the gigabeat and message said to check with manufacturer to see if there were any firmware upgrades. My conclusion is that it is easy to get support for IPOD's. You can actually go into one of their stores and get assistance. I give Toshiba a 1 on support.
2,Good Player with Bad Battery Life!!!,"I bough this product after reading several reviews from other people .Pros : Toshiba Gigabeat is really nice from the design perspective , the look and feel is pleasant. The software is well designed and pretty intutive . Though it doesn't have the click wheel like iPod , but I didnt find any problem using it and going through the various menus. They are all well designed and are visually much more better than the i-pod or other similar players. It takes some time to get use to the buttons and other controls , but once you get accustomed then its a zip .Cons : I returned this player after one week , because the biggest killer to it is the battery life, it hardly lasts for 6 hours. You cant expect a mp3 player to last just 6 hour. If I am outta my house , I should be able to play it for at least 12 hours...thats the only problem which i find with this, which undid all its goodness.Overall a good player , if you can live with a short battery life."
3,Great performance but terrible battery life,"I've had this for about a month now. On the plus side, it's very easy to use, accepts a variety of formats, and does everything as advertised. Some of my iPod-wielding friends have told me they find the Gigabeat easier to use than their iPods.On the other hand, the battery life is awful. I usually get about 4-5 hours. Spoke with Toshiba customer service, very friendly, said that this was the first complaint they'd heard concerning battery life. I'm sending it to Toshiba, where they will hopefully fix it.Other smaller gripes include the current lack of accessories--a carrying case and car power adapter would be handy."
2,"Great idea, terrible performance","First, let me start with the things I really DO like about the GB30. The user's interface is simple, the graphics are crisp, and it is ridiculously intuitive to manage and transfer music as a Napster Ready-to-Go device.However, the battery performance is pitiful. After 10 days (painfully aware that I am outside the window to return this for a refund from my seller), the battery would drain despite the fact that the unit was turned off. After reluctantly returning the unit to the Toshiba repair depot, I received it within another 7 days only to find that they did not fix the problem.So, I give up. I keep the unit fully charged by keeping it plugged in to the wall outlet between uses. However, I will never by another Toshiba product nor would I ever recommend this seller again."
3,Pros and Cons,"My boyfriend and I got each other the 30G Gigabeat for Christmas. It's really easy to use, has incredible picture quality, and plays the music very clear. It's also so easy to Sync the files with the software.CONS: Battery life is MISERABLE! The first few times I used it the life was pretty good. I haven't had it a month now and I'd be lucky to get 4-5 hours of battery life for audio only. I feel like it always needs to be on the charger. Also, I had some difficulty adding video files. I haven't looked into it much, but it shows an error and won't sync some video files."
5,Tremendous,"i bought this cd on the strength of hearing the first song one time from a friend. it was quite a departure from the type of music i usually like. it turned out to not even by the best song on the cd. that distinction would probably have to go to number five. i encourage anyone to purchase the cd, play it really loud and possibly affect your senses beforehand. enjoy."
3,Quite pleased.,These guys have a kind of technoish metal sound. This cd probably has the best bassist you will ever hear. The talented ones are the bassist and the drummer. The lyrics are focused on everyday teenager problems. Overall good cd with no growling vocal sound. note:some songs have no lyrics.
2,Disappointed,"As a Pitchshifterophile from a ways back, I was really looking forward to this release. Alas, I was sadly disappointed. I hesitate to say that PS has ""sold out"" so I guess they're just ""growing as a band""; yeah, whatever. If you want to capture Pitchshifter at their core sound, check out ""Submit"" or, better yet, ""Desensitized"". PS, in my less-than-humble opinion, was one of the first bands to perfect the balance between ""metal"" and ""techno"". ""Desensitized"" remains of the penultimate blends of these styles. I guess the new CD is OK, but I think it should be called ""Pitchshifter Lite""."
4,some of the only good techno out there,"This cd is great. My friend heard their cd at a music store and loved it, so I bought it. This ranks right up their in the techno catagory with orgy."
5,Ty collie beanie baby,"Happy to find this beanie baby which has been discontinued. Arrived ""new,"" and in great shape. Fun likeness of a rough collie."
2,I Think I Smell a Fraud - Avoid This One,"I believe that the city of Telos really does exist inside of Mount Shasta, which is probably why I found this book so bland. I had this book read in two hours; it's just the common rehash of the most known and repetitive sayings within the lightworker-type books ... you know what I mean if you have ever read any channeled material before. Or if you haven't, then I'd recommend Bashar's Blueprint For Humanity, or Seth Speaks, instead of this lightweight feel-good garbage. You could get even more than the whole of the gist of this book's message by simply spending ten minutes reading about the Lemurian City of Telos online for free. I would expect the Lemurian's violet flame of enlightenment to shine a little brighter than this. The two stars are for the chapter about the final war with one-world government elitists and how humanity will experience a time of peace afterwards. That was the only chapter in the book which wasn't a complete migraine to read."
4,Not as Hard as I'd Like,"This is a great book, but it's not quite hard enough. I live in Los Angeles and the LA Times crossword doesn't hold a candle to the NY Times for difficulty. I bought this book hoping for more of a challenge, but am finishing it way too fast. I'd have loved more puzzles with symbol/picture answers or answers where you have to squeeze an entire word into one box. There are a few of those here, but mostly straightforward puzzles. I think it's probably challenging enough for the average puzzler, but if you're a die-hard puzzle fan, you might be bored."
2,Get it together,"The subject is indeed fascinating, but the book is sloppily put together. Spelling errors run throughout the text, and a key player in the Phoenix sports scene is misidentified at one point. Those editing mistakes are really inexcusable, and the occasionally holier-than-thou tone of the narrative turned me off at times. If you insist on buying it, wait until it comes out in paperback...it'll be cheaper, and hopefully someone will proofread it in the meantime."
5,intermediate accounting,"easy to understand, a good book to have when trying to figure out what the text book is try to tell you."
5,Excellent for Beginners and Intermediate,"This video gives you great instruction on the step basics. Gin has a warm up, then an invigorating step workout, and ending with floor work. This is an excellent video for beginning step students."
2,Could be better,"This is one of Gin Miller's earlier videos. Her instructional style has changed drastically over time. Having gotten to know step aerobics via her ""new"" style, I have a very hard time following her old one as presented in this video. Her cueing is difficult to follow, doesn't stay on beat, and comes at the last possible second.The workout itself provides a good level of intensity. It's too bad that it's so hard to keep up until you have the movements memorized. I've found _Simply Step_ to provide a similarly good workout with much better cueing."
3,Not my favorite!,"I don't understand why everyone gave this video five stars. Yes, it is safe and effective and easy to master, but SO repetitive. Gin sounds like a drill instructor and the class participants look as if they are bored out of their minds. For me, the abdominal segment is not that good because Gin only does two or three reps of each exercise. I still do this video from time to time, but it is not one of my favorites. I prefer Kathy Smith's Step or Great Buns and Thighs Step Workout or Jane Fonda's Step and Stretch, where the participants at least act like they want to be there!"
1,Horrible,"This is quite a horrible video. I didn't break a sweat and the moves were incredibly basic. The style, steps, and dancers were just silly. I really had to make extra jumps, lifts, and moves to even raise my heart rate. Kari Anderson this ain't. Pass this one up, for sure!"
1,"Video great; DVD very, very poor","Don't get me wrong: The video is absolutely great. I never get tired of it. Not so the DVD: I could have burned it myself from the original tape I own and chaptered it up properly. With this DVD you have to fast-forward to even just get to the beginning of the workout as the chapters are not set properly. No nice menu, just a standard DVD-recorder setup. Anybody could have done that. No thought has been put into this. Far tooooo expensive for what it is, even if you pay for the name ""Reebbok"" on the wrapper.Very dissapointing."
5,"Tough Workout, But it really does the job.",I used to use this workout about 15 years ago. It is tough! You will definately get a great workout. The repetition actually is a benefit as it allows you to get the moves down and get a total workout.
5,I love this workout!!!,"I have had this on VHS for many years and still have it in my top two cardio workouts!The music is really motivating, Gin's queuing is right on and the team it great to look and inspires me to continue so I can look like them! The pace is really good as well. Some step workouts are so complicated and fast paced that I end up tripping or giving up, not this one. This one gets my heart rate up and gives a total body workout too.It is great for beginners through advanced as you can raise the step height as you get more fit."
3,This is where it all began,"From before they went platinum comes this single (title track taken from the excellent ""Separations"", in my opinion the first proper Pulp album), ranked #23 by the NME's Singles of the Year 1992 poll. A classical Pulp tune, whith all the elements that would make them unique someday: the excellent songwriting, irony and crooning drama. The B-sides are two re-workings of ""This house is condemned"", whose original version is also on ""Separations"". Interesting disco-kistch remixes. Not an essential record, but your Pulp discography will be utterly incomplete if you are as obsessed as I am with their 1992-1994 period, when they released their best stuff: the ""Intro"" and ""His'n'Hers"" albums."
3,Kindle version needs work,"I've just begun the book, based on a friend's recommendation, and this edition needs some editing. It seems to be an OCR of a physical book, and there are many odd spaces inserted, and random capitalizations of the letter S."
3,Tal and Milla,"Do you like fantasy books?? If you do, then you will love the fall and all the other ""seventh tower"" books. The fall is a very interesting book because it does not really make that much sense. then is starts to get better because you know what it is.The story is about iceships, and mostly hidden magic. tal is the main character because he has to get a sunstone for his family before tal is 13 and 1 quarter old. tal has a mom which is sick and is in bed 24/7. he also has a little brother and sister he has to watch over because his dad ran away a while ago.I would probably reccomend this book to a friend because it is a very good book and i think any one would like it just as much. you would mostly only like it if you like fantasy and science fiction books. I hope you like my review and i hope it helps."
1,A Bad Book,"This Book, The 7th Tower: The Fall might just be the worst book I have ever read. The book is boring, and doesn't have a good plot, and it is very non-descriptive. If you are looking for a book to buy, don't buy this book, buy some good books! Try Harry Potter series, and all of The Wrinkle In Time Books if you are into magic and fantasy. Don't waste your money!"
4,Great beginning,"This book was the beginning of a great series. After I read it, I was desperate to go and buy the second book, because this one ended as a cliffhanger. The story was set in a fantasy world, and the whole world is covered in a dark veil. Now that was very interesting when I read about it. A boy thought the castle he lived in IS the world, till he was blown by the wind to somewhere far from the ""world"" he knew. However, the boy was destined to change the way everything is now, although he was not aware of it. I recommend you to buy this book, and if you don't like it, you don't have to read the others in the series, but I think you will."
2,"Ah, mediocrity...","What can I say? Only that this book falls in the general range of mediocrity...My biggest problem with this book was that it was too short to develop any sort of plot. It just meanders aimlessly to an end that isn't even an end; the story is just left hanging ""for an upcoming sequel"" I guess. The idea itself isn't a bad one: a sheltered wizard boy tries to save his family, but winds up being shown the outside world. It's just the way that the author goes about developing, or shall I say not developing, the story that I have a problem with. Anyway, this is not exactly something to put on your ""top reads"" list."
2,Not Good,"All I can say was this was not a very good book. There was not a lot action, but there was a few good parts in it. The plot was unclear and very confusing. It also gave me a headache, so unless you can get it for 85% off the price please don't bother. Buy the Jedi Apperntice books instead.(there on this website)"
1,This book should be nixed,"I was asked to read this book from beginning to end, and that is the only reason I continued to read this book beyond the prologue (""Zero?"" Give me a break). The plot is disjointed, and there is nothing about the protagonist Tal that makes you care about him one way or another. The only female character that isn't hard, cold or downright malicious is Tal's mother, and she spends the majority of the book suffering from a mysterious illness that keeps her at death's door. Good science fiction/fantasy is well written and suspenseful (one chapter actually ends with ""Let the battle begin!""), not just a version of a ""Star Wars"" film put into words on a page. This book is a colossal waste of time."
4,The Ear The Eye And The Arm,"This book is amazing. It has everything in it suspense, adventure and fantasy of a year we'll never be able to see. This book takes place in Zimbabwe, Africa. It is about a the children of a very succesful general. These kids want to win an adventure badge for their scouts but their father, the general, wont allow them to leave their home. So they decide to escape. But when they escape danger lurks right around the corner. They go through things you cant imagine. They get turned into slaves, become hostages, get chase by a huge gang, that everyone is afraid of and more. I recommend this book to everyone. I think anyone who likes to read would like this book."
3,boyfriends book,i bought this book for my boyfriend cuz he likes stuff like this and he like garth nix but hes never heard of this one so i hope he likes it
2,"Not quite, but close","This review is for the european edition (revised, finnish).There is a mention of a globe population of 6 billion, but in the next chapter it says 5,5. Hungarian language isn't an indoeuropean language as one would think looking at the map on the languages page. This is however corrected in the country section.The starting general chapters are truly general and lack some information found in more comprehensive books or atlases. Suitable for young people and for those who are selecting travelling destinations. May act as a starting point in getting to know foreign cultures, but at least in the finnish edition some of the names of the near-by cities are taken from war-time maps, cities which have never in peace-time been part of Finland. A good atlas to buy if you like to travel abroad, and read, a bit, background before your trip."
1,DISSAPOINTING,"IT IS A PITTY THAT THIS WONDERFULLY COLORED AND HARDCOVERED BOOK LACKS IN ACCURATE INFORMATION. JUST ONE LITTLE EXAMPLE WILL TELL YOU WHY: THE AUTHOR COUNTS MEXICO AS A CENTRAL AMERICA COUNTRY! WHAT A MISTAKE! MEXICO, ALONG WITH U.S.A. AND CANADA IS OFFICIALLY LOCATED AS NORTH AMERICA. A REAL SHAME FOR THE AUTHOR!"
2,"Nearly useless, very abstract and badly edited","Audition apparently seems to be some kind of unwanted stepchild of Adobe, based on the scarcity of resources Adobe seems to have dedicated to it. I bought this book based on other positive experiences with the ""Visual Quickstart Guide"" series, but as another reviewer states, this book barely covers what should essentially be in a basic user's manual. There is little if any detail, very few case-study example, and some significant holes in the instructions.Example: in the ""Using Cues"" section - there is a section ""to list and edit your cues,"" to ""move cues"" and to ""delete cues""...but it says nothing about creating a cue to start with. These types of omissions can drive beginners insane, and signals some pretty bad editing.Further, abstract explanations of sounds (or worse, how sounds work) are nearly useless. This book badly needs an accompanying cd. Five seconds of actual audio can teach more that fifty pages of words. Avoid this book."
1,Not worth buying,"I got this book and the Adobe User's Guide when I purchased Adobe Audition 1.5. This book requires that you have a pretty good idea of what is going on in recording and gives hardly any examples of practical applications for how you can use the program. It is simply the type of book that says, if you want to do this, here are the steps to accomplish that feat. The Adobe user's guide isn't much better."
2,"What, More Horse Chunks?","Harris reprises his weak and tepid role of an 1800's gentleman who can't stomach modern life in England so he goes back to the Plains to find his adopted tribe of Sioux Indians. He finds them on the verge of extinction, starvation and he is there to lead them to new hope, which means bowing to his leadership. Why the Sioux didn't kill him in the first film goes beyond reason. More silly stuff from hippies in the 1970's in this second installment of the wildly popular but empty ""A Man Called Horse"" saga. Look for a psychedelic scene where Harris is ""behind"" naked while emerged in color shots of eagles flying in the sky."
3,The Return of a Man Called Horse,"This is the second in the series of three, the orginal movie called ""A Man Called Horse"". ""Return of a Man Called Horse"" is okay. The main character played by Richard Harris is back in England and becomes bored with life and decides to return to the Sioux tribe that captured him 4 years earlier. I would say that it repeats somethings from the original like the ""Vow to the Sun""(done alittle differently this time) and some of the characters have returned but not many. Difinitely watch it if you have seen ""A Man Callled Horse""(which is OUTSTANDING) just so you can have the satisfaction of seeing the series and of course the wonderful actor Harris. Movie is nowhere near as good as the first film but is you enjoy Harris, watch it. Have fun."
5,Why is this book out of print?,"In all of my research and testing, it seems like its the best choice of dictionaries. I have a couple of different ones, but usually dont even bother with anything else."
4,Works BUT,"Does what they are supposed to do. Got two non swivel and two swivel for a work bench.Problem is the swivel ones are a tad taller cause of the swivel plate. So had to use scrap plywood to bring the non-swivel up even. You think they would take this into account with the non swivel ones and make them a tad taller. O well. One star ding for that, poor Industrial design not thinking of people using set of each. But build wise and use they are great. Don't hesitate to buy but be warned about the height difference with non swivel if your project calls for swivel and non swivel casters."
3,Height problem!,"Amazon proposes this caster in a set with the d2588. Just be aware that for some reason they are not the same total height (d2599 are higher), so if you want to mount them together you need to shim the d2588."
3,Good if you don't mind the wiggles.,"I went cheap on this item, and was saving about $4 per wheel compared to the wheels I purchased at HD. However, once I attached these things to my mobile cart and locked the wheels in place, I was very disappointed. I mean, the wheels are nice, rubbery, and big, but the bearings that attach to the mounting plate are loose and therefore not suitable for my mobile cart. If you don't need to lock these, go for it, but if you are looking for a firm steady mobile base (when the wheels are locked) go to HD and pay the $12 a wheel -- they are rock solid."
3,"It's a watch, what did you expect?","I received this watch as a b-day gift, it's a descent enough everyday watch, nothing too fancy. The 'easy' button on the band release can be both a blessing and a curse and sometimes the band will open unexpectedly but this could just be me not being used to wearing a watch.I like the blue face and the orange second hand is nice as it really stands apart from the face and other hands. Date feature is pretty much standard these days but I do like the 24 hour clock as when you're setting the time/date, it helps out to know you're am/pm status.Haven't tried out the water feature yet and honestly, probably won't but always good to know it's there. The watch does have a rotating 'ring' around the face with quarter intervals on it and perhaps this is my own ignorance but I don't know what this is for! Some type of manual timer? Not really sure and product documentation doesn't address it at all.Overall, it's a descent watch... does it's job and looks good."
3,All skill level book,This art clay (trade name) book covers what everyone should know that is going to use the Art Clay brand metal clay. The first sections/chapters get the basic stuff down so one can move on to the fun parts making the projects. The pictures are of a good size with large numbers to correspond to the descriptive blurbs. They are of the close up type with little background of the work surface visible. (I do hate it when they show more work surface than the item they are making.) The material lists are well thought out in their content. The glossary and the gemstone characteristic chart is a nice touch. the chart really important in selecting stones to bake with the clay. I own it
4,18 Pieces to Make in a Day!,"It is pretty much nonsense that you can make these pieces in a day-- some of them maybe yes, but mostly no. Some of the directions given don't work, and then if you want to make the piece you are on your own. But there are some interesting new ideas."
2,art clay book,"This book is full of great designs, however- I would not recommend this book for any self taught student. One can be self taught and not have to spend $300+ on a teacher telling you what you can learn on your own. Metal clay is NOT a hard product to learn. There are too many books on the market that read the same and have the same information on metal clay. My advise, free tutorials on the net are the best way to learn. Not only are the books on the market the same on metal clay, but do all of the authors have to word their instructions on every single move that their hands make? In conclusion, this book is good for the basics of metal clay and to make the designs in the book only. You can incorporta your own ideas after learning the way to execute a design. Purchase one or two great books on metal clay and leave it at that."
5,Art Clay Silver & Gold,This too is a wonderful book. It was bought at your suggestion. It came quickly & is a great price!
2,I'm So Disappointed,"I purchased this for 2 songs: Your Mama Won't Like Me & Bit Off More Than I Could Chew (1 star for each song). I had the 8-track titled Your Mama Won't Like Me years ago & for the past ten years can not find a copy of it. It is obvious that Ms. Quatro had different people work on that tape, than anything else she ever recorded. Those two songs have deep soul to them whereas everything else is 50ish style pop. I chose this CD because both songs were there. They are the only songs worth mentioning at all. You can notice the difference in style and man what a difference. I only wish she continued in that direction. p.s. on Your Mama Won't Like Me she did a rendition of Fever that would just blow you away. Damn I wish I could find a copy of that..."
5,My 11 yr old LOVES it!,"We got this for my sons 11th birthday, we had been wanting a chemistry set. We compared sets and looked at reviews and decided this one was a good one. We are very pleased with this set, it arrived safely, and is very well stocked. The directions are easy to follow and the experiments interesting and educational. It is definitely not the same chemistry set *I* had growing up. I'd buy it again and/or recommend it with no problem."
4,Good Item,We are enjoying this item. It really is not a toy though. We are learning a lot. The only con about this item I have found so far is it does not have a case. So storage was a problem. I did break an item because of having to move the containers around. I wanted to keep everything is order but this did not work out well. So we removed everything and put it in baskets. But good upgrade to this kit would be a case.But all together is has made a great chem set. We are using it with our home school curriculum. And I think there will be enough projects and information to get us through most of the year.
3,Too expensive,"I used to buy the exact same product here for nineteen dollars less. Now I go to the manufacturer's website and buy them directly. If you want to save some money I suggest you do, too."
4,cat loves this toy,"My cat goes crazy for this toy, but must be used under adult supervision, or he will ""kill the bird"". We play with it for about 10 minutes at a time, he chases it around, I let him catch it, then it ""flies"" around again. 4 stars because of durability, 5 stars for how much he likes it"
1,LOW quality workmanship!,"A $10 cat toy with $7 refills (my local price, or amazon + shipping) should last more than 24 hours. The stupid toy is MEANT to be pounced on and chewed, why isn't it made to tolerate that? One of four feathers came off it as we took it out of the package, the other 3 were gone by next morning. MAJOR rip-off!"
1,not a good item,This feather could not be used because the hook is metal and sharp. Not the one I thought.
1,"Much deeper than ""Basic""!","This is an extremely difficult book to follow and read. I thought by the title of the book, it would give me a basic understanding to help in teaching Sunday School. This book is much better for people who already know alot about the Bible and its history."
4,Good mounts,"I got these mounts for the system in my basement. When I opened the package, I worried that they might be cheaply made, as they are plastic, but they are solid, so don't let that stop you. The package contained any attachment or tool that you'd need to put these up anywhere (excluding a drill, but the bit you need comes with it). The drywall anchors leave something to be desired, as they are not made to prevent spinning when you put in the screws. I had to use my own. Other than that, I am very pleased, however I can see how I will need to keep the included allen wrench handy as the screws will likely get loose over time and the speaker positioning screws would need adjusting over time, due to vibrations from the speakers when in use. I am not at all concerned with the possibility of the speakers falling down. These mounts are pretty solid. I am pretty pleased."
4,Perfect for smaller satellite speakers,"These mounts are made of durable plastic and work well for smaller satellite speakers. They came with an adapter that fit my Energy RC Micro speakers perfectly. The mounting hardware is of good quality and the installation instructions are simple and easy to follow. The reason for the 4 star rating versus a 5 star is that the main pivot point for positioning speakers is not multi-directional. You can only move right to left or up/down depending on how you position the shaft at the mounting base. If you position for up/down speaker movement, the tension is not strong enough to hold the speaker up. The weight of the speaker will cause the speaker to sag. That being said, if you are mounting your speakers at a listening height level to your ears and you only need left to right adjustments from the mounts, these affordable mounts are the ones for you."
5,GREAT SPEAKER MOUNTS,"GREAT MOUNTS VERY UTHE SPEAKERS I BOUGHT ONLY HAD A TEAR DROP SLOT IN THE BACK ,,, AND THEY STILL WORKED FINE .. VERY STURDY WELL PRICED COMPARED TO LOCAL STORES."
3,Wierd show,"Low budget show, we bought it because the ""Lawman"" was a co-star on this series. We were disappointed, although a few of the episodes were OK."
3,A good series but Lawman starring John Russell was way better !,"If you like children's adventure stories then this is for you.However I still have memories of the opening theme music to Lawman starring John Russell, and the very convincing acting of all who starred and appeared in this western series,especially Deputy Johnny McKay played by Peter Brown.Amazon, make this available soon!"
4,Soldier On!!,Adventure!! Action!! Excitement in the African jungle to South America to the Middle East all filmed at Revue Studios in Hollywood in the 1950's.Who cares where it was made!!If you love your TV Adventure shows from the 50's and 60's buy it!!Stars John Russell(Brother of Jayne (The Outlaw) Russell)and Chick (Fehmer) Chandler top second banana in a zillion TV and movies from this era.Jump in to your time machine television and zip back to when TV was FUN!!!
3,Ceiling mounts only,"The installation .pdf Amazon posts, which is what Omnimount provides in their package is deceiving. This package that Amazon sells is only for ceiling mounts and not wall mounts. It only comes with ceiling mount hardware and they don't include keyhole adapter. The mount is fairly easy to install. Omnimount customer service shipped out missing keyhole adapter, but were not very receptive to my comments about how confusing their packaging is."
1,False Advertising,"To my regret, I ignored what the other reviewer said.Despite the picture showing them wall-mounted, and the PDF file description, these are CEILING mounted mounts."
4,different color than stated,"This is a nice watch and I decided to keep it, even though it is a different color than what is stated in the description. I expected a black strap, but it is actually a very dark brown. I could understand how someone might mistake it for black, someone who may not pay that close attention to colors. But those of us who do will immediately recognize it as a dark brown. It's still an attractive and useful watch, so I decided to keep it anyway."
2,"If ""unisex"" means ""women's"", then this watch is unisex...","Time to reiterate: the face on this watch is 1""x1"". It's very small. So small in fact that, within minutes of the watch arriving, I gave it to my wife. Are there smaller women's watches? Yes. Are their men's watches as small as this? Really, no. Is this watch truly ""unisex""? Probably not."
2,Dial color isn't black,I may have overlooked it in the description but I expected the background of the watch to be black as it shows in the picture. It's gray. It's hard to see any contrast with the hands. I'm disappointed in that one feature since the picture clearly shows a black face.
2,not a standard sized men's watch,"Watch is very small for a men's watch. This was misleading in the information provided, and there was no indication the watch was small--basically the size of a women's watch."
4,Definitely bigger than a women's watch,"I recently got this watch and wanted to respond to the other review that said this watch was the size of a women's watch. It's not. Granted it is not as large as some other men's watches out there today, but to me watches have gotten ridiculously large. It's like having a hockey puck attached to your wrist. This watch is basically the same size as every other ""field"" watch I've ever had, and I've had many, including those from LL Bean, Victorinox and Wenger.My only complaint about the watch is that the ticking is fairly loud. Otherwise it's fine, especially for $40. The gray face is understated and the Indiglo feature still amazes me 15 years after it was introduced. Plus, its a Timex, so you can be assured that its decent quality and that it won't cost you $100 or more to get the battery replaced."
5,Ladies' Timex Expedition Watch,"This is the third watch of this type that I've had. They are great in meeting all my needs: practical, burnished silver color, dark face, clear white numbers, Indiglo light, and dark comfortable band. I recommend this watch highly."
5,Timex Unisex Metal Field Watch,"Excellent product! My son is so happy with this watch - it's the second time we bought the same one! Thank you for your great service, Amazon!"
4,A little pricey for what it is,I thought it was a little pricey for no more than it is but the youngest boy was very happy with it so I will give it a 4.
4,I am a Giants fan,Unfortunately I had to buy this for my brother who is a cowboys fan. It felt like it burnt my soul being a loyal Giants fan. He was so happy that he actually hung this sign in his office.
1,False advertisement,I ordered this thinking it was a street sign turns out it's a license plate guard! I am very disappointed and am planning on demanding a refund!
1,Taxidermist Road Kill,"Product did not meet my expectations based upon its description. Sorry to say, but it looks and feels like road kill. Not fluffy at all, but flat fur that looks like it was cut from a slow bunny caught under a Michelin. My gal would Urp if I touched this thing to her skin; maybe even at the sight of it..... Resulted in a Knight let down..!"
4,People Skills 101 for the Clueless Executive,"Practical advice on working with a team facing an impasse of some sort. It's concise, readable, and likely to be of help. Personally, I think they should have included a chapter along the lines of ""fire everyone you work with and double your dose of antidepressants,"" but maybe my problems are a little bit bigger than average."
4,Great book for teambuilding,"Unstuck is the perfect book to use for a teambuilding exercise. Pass the book out to each member and let them read it in their own way. Not only is the book short, but you don't even have to read it cover to cover -- the authors encourage readers to take a non-linear approach and suggest paths to becoming unstuck. Gather up the troops and compare the experiences. Did everyone identify the same problems with the team? What types of ideas were sparked by reading of the book?Much of what the authors say is common sense. But, sometimes common sense is the first thing that's lost when things start to go wrong. Unstuck is more fun to read than most of the business type books out there, but it also includes references to more serious and in-depth resources. Plus, it looks good on a bookshelf."
2,browse it before you buy it!!,"i checked this out in the bookstore because i was roped in by the cover. upon first flip, i was intrigued by the set-up: it's very cute, very modern, really cool layout. however, the content leaves something to be desired. it's aimed towards business ppl types, those in the corporate team/power structure that need to get it together and create momentum for great business ideas or something like that. i'm not sure. i couldn't really get past the first handful of pages before i saw that this book wasn't something i could read or would even be something that was remotely useful to me. generally, the advice isn't really practical day to day advice, it's about getting your team together to get your business running. if that's you, check it out. if not, steer clear!"
1,"Unstuck: A tool for yourself, your team, and your world","I was under the impression that this book would help me get unstuck from my current career. This book is primarily for teams, and even that it is very weak in creating a formula to help solving complex problems. The suggestions that it does give are so basic and simple that the author was either wanting just to sell a book of random ""nice"" thoughts, or has not been in the private sector to realize the complexities of doing business. The last comment in the book is what pushed me over the edge, it recommended buying a copy of this for everyone that I know in the business world to help them. The only money I would waste is buying a copy for the authors, they obviously haven't listened to their own advice."
4,Get out of that rut!,"This book came just at the right time. My group at work, and really my whole company, was just ""stuck."" I cannot motivate the whole company, but the ideas in Unstuck can help to motivate my group and get us out of the rut we have been in. Some of the ideas are not new, but sometimes it is easy to forget how to get motivated and how to motivate others and a reminder is all that is needed.Unstuck is not a huge, tedious ""business"" book. It is small, quick to read, helpful and funny. It contains practical diagnostic tools and solutions that are as applicable to everyday life as they are to the workplace."
4,Recommended to me - and I would pass that rec on....,"This book was recommended to my by that person you contact about your career hoping for a mentor and they fob you off... well it actually was a good recommendation, and I soon realized he was not fobbing me off but giving me good advice. Its a quick read (took me an hour - though I must say I am a fast 'skim' reader) and has some really useful tips which I did not use on the spot but pop back to my mind as I move along."
5,A fun book to own,"A sneak peek behind the Green Acres phenomenon. Contains exclusive interviews, publicity photos, trivia & episode guide."
5,Health or grammar?,"If we want to read a book in perfect grammar and punctuation, we could read countless English and grammar books. Mrs. Cox's book is easily followed, easy to remember when shopping for my family, and just plain common sense nutrition. Since most of us have heard the rhetoric time and time again and still don't follow what ""science"" tells us to do anyway, it is refreshing to have a one on one coversation with her in this book. The entire time I was reading, I felt as if she was just having a simple, encouraging converation with me. Her book works! (oops another exclamation point). I have put these suggestions to task, and have lost over 30 pounds, without going on a ""fad diet"" which no one can survive on forever. Success wins in my book!"
1,Is this really helpful?,"I have never written a review of a book this bad before. As I scan down a typical page of Ms. Cox's guidebook for nutritional choices, I find about 11 exclamation points. I bought this book because it promised a no-nonsense approach to food and weight management. What it delivered is nothing but pure nonsense. On the topic of water, she says ""drink it. It does so taste good!"" On the topic of coffee she says ""drink it black. It does so taste good!"" How is this helpful? Where is the discussion on the nutritional benefits of proper hydration? Where is the research around the pro's and con's of including caffeine in a diet regime. Some basic information, some basic research findings aught to be a part of a book on nutrition. Wouldn't you think?I found the book to be a poorly written list of commands. Do this! Do that! Don't do this! We are all thoughtful, intelligent adults, Ms. Cox. A bit of explaining WHY would have gone a long way."
2,Cost waaaay too much,I think I could have gotten something similar at a dollar store for less than 1/4 of what I paid for this.
5,Two great books in one!,"""Two For The Money"" which is two novels in one(Bait Money & Blood Money), was great! I found the plots intriguing, and the character Nolan to be wonderful.The pages just flew by.I can't believe these works were Max Allan Collins' first few tries.Book one ""Bait Money"" was penned while he was in college at the University Iowa, the 2nd book ""Blood Money came several years later. (According to MAC's afterward).If he could produce work at this level so young, I shutter to think what his later work is like.I'm definitely going to read all the Max Allan Collins I can get my hands on.Great books, great author, and a great line of books (Hard Case Crime). I can't recommend all of them enough!Happy Reading!"
5,If You Like Parker ...,"Fine vintage noir writing with few wasted words. Protagonist Nolan is a slightly more sentimental version of Westbrook's (i.e., Richard Stark) Parker. If you like the Parker books, you'll like these too. Hopefully, Collins has a few more reprises of this character left ..."
5,Wonderful story!,"I really liked this book from start to end.This book could easily become an animated movie. If that happens, I'll be first in line.Tom Klejne - 3Dartist."
5,Elmo is timeless!,This is my second copy. It has been my sons favorite movie since he was six months old. He is now three. He watches it regularly no matter what the season!
2,It's a pain,"I got this as a Christmas present but unfortunately for me, I never used it until now. So I couldn't get my money back on this but I did not buy it from Amazon. Every time I turn my pc on I have to reset it. Putting batteries in takes a lot of effort and the plastic cover won't come off easily. The pointer will move by itself without any prompting. It's cute and pink but that's it. Save your money and get something better."
1,It doesn't work,I just received the mouse and it simply doesn't work. The receiber is ok but the mouse doesn't turn on with the new batteries. I do not know if I can retunr it becuase I ordered to Amazon from a different country and it looks the warranty is valid only for the US. I had spend money in something that would never work!
1,It doesn't work:(,"I love the design, but it doesn't work at all. Can I send it back to get a replacement? I threw away the packing slip."
1,hello kitty mouse,I bought this because i like hello kitty.But it did not meet my expatiation. It works sometimes then it gets stuck i wouldn't tell any one to buy it.
1,It didn't work!!!!,"It arrived on time, but it didn't work. So I'm gonna have to return it :((((((( which it is annoying since it was ""SANTA' gift for my daughter."
3,Weight gain 4000;Big gay als big gay boatride,not as good as the others but thats foor you to decide
5,Ample Parking In South Park!!,"This videotape contains episodes 3 & 4 of South Park: ""Weight Gain 4000"", where Cartman wins an essay contest, gets South Park on TV, and gets to meet Kathie Lee Gifford. Of course he needs to get bulked up on Weight Gain 4000 to impress Kathie Lee, hence the title. And ""Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride"", where Stan finds out his dog Sparky is gay, and Sparky runs away to Big Gay Al's gay animal shelter. Will Stan find Sparky and return in time to be the star quarterback in the big football game?? 2 very funny episodes, definitely not for young kids. END"
1,Capitalists,"after all the commercialization of it, with the video tapes, shirts, hats, magnets, etc..etc.. it has gotten quite old. I believe the creators of south park are just capitalist pigs just like the poloticians and the corperate guys, what we dont know keeps the contracts alive, dont fall into the capitalist BS, anarchy forever...and its not ""great animation"", its ""construction paper"" END"
2,Not that great but better than Vol. 1,"SOUTH PARK VOL. 2 is a slight improvment on the first volume but still thats nothing to howl about. The first episode is how Cartmen uses a one of them muscle drinks to get in shape but grows even fatter; I thoght that this episode was not bad, it may be a little lumpy at times but it's funny. The second episode is how Stan's new gay dog, Sparky (played by George Clooney) escapes to a sancturary owned by the hilarious Big Gay Al. This episode reeks until Al comes along and provides a couple of laughs. You should buy some of the other videos that come later on in this series."
2,incomprehensible,"Another jargon loaded archaeological theory classic. It reviews major trends of post-processual archaeology, but it sent me and most of my friends in the archaeology course straigh to sleep. If you want a good book on theory, that wont have the same effect, get Matthew Johnsons archaeological theory. ITs in plain english for a change."
5,banjo's for all,"An educational and informative discourse on a key aspect of african-american folk music brought to life by the first person reminiscences of the children of black slaves. This book ensures that their lives and stories do not disappear into the sands of time. Although the banjo is the central topic of this book, it is really the framework to tell the stories of the black banjo songsters. All in all a good read."
3,"Well parented information, orphaned plot","Mr. Rojo, like many Spanish novelists of these days, has a surplus of titanic writing but soft muscle in the art of creating, nurturing and taming a John Grisham or Tom Clancy type of plot. ""El ojo ajeno"" is a well-bred suspense with original characters and can take the reader on a roller-coaster of speculation and double-guessing. But it simply misses a top-notch punch line. You will enjoy the trip, but not the destination."
5,Good cans,"I have used these phones for mixing live music (5 voices w/ CD track) at outside and inside venues. They work great! The dB reduction is not extraordinary, but definitely good enough to work. I wish they had the option for a side to flip away from the ear, but I am able to have one side on an ear and the other rest against my head when necessary. They sound great plugged into a computer or mp3 player. I appreciate that the 1/8""to1/4"" adapter screws in to the phones, but this may limit its use to only these phones. I can use the adapter on my apple ear buds, but not an 1/8"" to 1/8"" chord."
4,Fantastic sound,Short and simple: I love these headphones. The only problem I have is that the coiled cord beings to uncurl and knot up in some places (after a few times on rolling in back up). The pads have started to flake a bit too. Amazing sound quality nonetheless. Perfect for audio mixing and editing.
4,Mediabridge 3.5mm Male To 3.5mm Male Stereo Audio Cable - 8 Feet...,"This product was ordered for my girls computer. It is easy to hook up, easy to use and ships withing a few days"
4,Workhorse Headphones,I work for a audio company and we use these headphones as a standard. They are a good price and they last forever. We use them every day! I have had mine for over 10 years. The only problem is the foam above the head starts to degrade that leaves little black specks in ones hair.
4,Best for the money.,These professional headphones semi-replace the older MDR series of headphones with definite improvements in sound quality. So good that I bought another pair. The only thing they're not is stylish. <shrug>
3,Shocks to the Ear,"I am having the same problem that another reviewer on this site has had (and others elsewhere if you surf the web a little): Whenever I move my feet or shift in my seat, the headphones send a series of static shocks to my ears. This happens frequently. I have never had another pair of headphones do this. I called Sony and they said they would send me a replacement pair. I hope the replacement pair does not have this problem, because otherwise they sound very good and are comfortable and well-built, which is why I still give them three stars despite this unacceptable design flaw."
2,Returned Item,The sound was fine. The problem was after less than 1 week if I paid $93.00 for them I do not expect the ear foam piece on the left side to come off from just removing them from my head. Amazon is very cool about returning an item because they are on the way today. Some people may think it is a easy fix but I looked at thinking if this happens in less than one week I am returning them I will use my $25 Sennheiser headphones until I decide my next decision but sorry it will not be a replacement of the same. Thanks Gin for your help.
1,Caution : Left channel stops working within few months of use!!,"I got these headphones with the assumption that they are professional grade and would last me long in addition to having better audio quality. But after a few months of moderate use the left speaker stopped working!!!While I had them with both channels working, they were comfortable to use with sound output a notch above most. But the recent failure has left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Not worth the $$ I spent on this product"
4,Great,"Headphone quality is great. I've used them alot. I'd rather hear a little more bass strength in them, but that's ok. I am a Music Composition major at Baylor University, so sound quality is extremely important for me (symphonies, classical music, etc.). These headphones more than do the job. They seem like they will last too. You'll be glad you bought them, and they are more than worth the money."
5,Amazing sound quality,"I moved from an older model Sony headset to this one. I'd been using my older one for 15+ years and it's still ticking along nicely. However, I needed something with more dynamic range. This model was suggested independently by two friends, each fellow musicians. Their recommendations were spot-on. This set is amazing. Upon first-listen, my jaw was on the floor listening to the difference in my audio mixes. I'm sure this set will hold up nicely if it behaves like my previous Sony set. Get them. You will love the results."
5,"""Professional"" just like it says","I purchased these as a gift for my husband to use in our home recording studio. They are comfortable, block sound both coming in to the headphones and escaping out while monitoring (which is critical when recording with a sensitive condenser microphone).The headphones are solid, sound great, sensitive and comfortable. The cord is coiled unlike the previous pair of JVC headphones. Small touches are very professional, like the 1/4 plug adapter which screws on instead of just clicking in place. The packaging is also very nice with a nylon or silk like cloth lining.So far these have performed and sounded great!"
5,Tremendous headphones,"Excellent product. It came on time, on the early side, as promised. This is a very solid item that I use in a professional studio environment. For the price and quality you won't be disappointed. Well worth it."
5,headphones that will blow your mind,"studio monitor headphones, clear sound even at low volumes if not in a noisy environment.black, which makes them look smaller than they actually are, so you won't look like an alien if you use them with your portable music player (beware that if mp3s are low quality you'll notice it, but if you use a minidisc or a cd, you might end up liking records that you did not appreciate with other phones) AND not at all heavy which means you can wear them for hours without it being bothering.these phones SHOULD NOT be your choice only if you are a dj, the loud music coming from the speakers would be bothering.delivery was fast."
1,BEWARE THE FALLING OFF EARPADS!,"There are many fine sounding headphones out there, and these, although expensive are ok.There are several I have owned (and lost or broken) which have similar sonic qualities, despite what you may have read about these being ""industry standard"". Audio Technica and Sennheiser are examples.There are none that I have ever owned (professional musician, producer here) that have ever had more hideously attached (or NOT) ear pads. One week in, one pad came detached while gently taking them out of their carry bag. I have not been able to reattach since. ANd I'm a pretty handy fella: keyboard player, knob twister, soldering guy etc. THE PADS ARE NOT ATTACHED IN ANY WAY EXCEPT FOR A THIN PLASTIC RIM WHICH SLIDES AROUND THE PLASTIC EARPIECE-AND WHEN THEY COME OFF, AS CLEARLY IS OFTEN THE CASE, DO NOT GO BACK ON. Hideous design, maddeningly inappropriate for ""industry"" use. THerefore...useless to me.Thanks for listening. Be warned."
3,Can cause ear fatigue,"I bought these headphones because I needed something better than walkman headphones, and I needed something that would block out external sounds. In that sense, these phones are good for monitoring in loud environments, but are not exactly pleasing to listen to. In my opinion the treble is not fun to hear, it's very unnatural. You can notice how much these phones are coloring the sound, especially for transient signals. Hyped bass and treble, with a blurry midrange. I am comparing these to the AKG K240, which are quite the reverse; excellent, clear midrange with gently subdued bass and treble. This is the way it should be, because the midrange is the most important band; it is where human speech lies. In conclusion, this is a practical pair of headphones, well-built, but with too much sound coloration to be pleasing with hi-fi listening or pro-audio mixing applications."
5,Great Headphones,I use these headphones with my Amateur Radio equipment. I have had another pair in the past which my daughter has now. There are highly rated on eHam review. I love mine.
5,Professional Headphones,"I use headphones in my work as a transcriptionist and this is my second pair of Sony. They are wonderful, drown out outside noise and give me the ability to pick up dialog I wouldn't be able to hear with conventional headphones. They are comfortable after hours of wearing them. My last pair lasted over five years, finally the leather started flaking off the ear pieces and the coil was tangled up so badly that it started wearing through and wires were exposed. My husband use electric tape and still uses them for his Ipod. This new pair seems (so far) to have that tangled cord problem fixed, which is so annoying. The cord seems heavier and doesn't twist up. I've been using it for several months with no cord problems, but we'll see how that lasts in the long run. Comes with a nice leather bag for storage. I would recommend."
3,Good sound but not comfortable.,"Got this to monitor my recordings.For sound quality, it's a good buy for this price. Very balance sound with correct high and low frequencies.But is very uncomfortable. I can't keep this for more than 5 minutes on my head."
5,Excellent Product,Bought these for my wife. She is a church organist and likes to practice quietly both at home and at the church. The headsets are in the bag and she says they are excellent.
3,High is pretty prenounced,"I used to have a pair of old school MDVR600 and they were just a work horse of a set. I picked these up and right off the back the highs were so high. Everything sounded clear except I couldn't get over the highs. I am mixing down mainly modern hiphop hop and electronic and to me personally they just aren't made for this type of mixing.I thought maybe it was just my mix but listened to several recent hiphop( Kanye) and alternative (Imagine Dragons) and they were just to hissy for me.I guess if you had time to break them in, cool but I don't and just need them to be flat response right out the box."
4,sony MDR7506,"The product is fine overall, I believe there are greater headphones built by Sony, but for that kind of price it's hard to find a better product. I enjoy listening to all kind of music with headphone eveb though the bass is lower that for example a beats headset."
4,Professional headphones,"For the money a nice pair of ""professional use"" headphones. I would have liked a touch more bass in them, but have no regrets with my purchase!"
1,Good Phones but before you buy,"I bought the MDR 7506 because my professor suggested them. I am in school for Recording Technology and to mix and listen to playback these headphones are ideal. They give you the true sound of a mixed track. I don't suggest these as everyday listening headphones because they are a little on the flat side. If you want a nice clean sounding pair of phones get the AKG 240's. The bass is a little more beefier but it still stays true and the highs are really clean without distortion. Plus they are roughly the same price, give or take 5 - 10 bucks up or down. My AKG's were about $5. less than the MDR's."
3,Good starting point,"Well built, comfortable and durable.Good headphone set if you want to start listening music to a superior level,they will teach you to play with equalization and most probably you willunderstand what kind of sound you're looking for.Finally, good the price, but if you're looking for a revolution, buy something else..."
2,MeDiocRe..nothing more...,"it's about ok level, slightly below than that. it's value should be about $20~25. I'm a serious music fan. I enjoy from Classical, Country, POP, Rock, all the way towards Death Metals. Find sony branded headphones with red tags in TJ maxx or other stores liquidation carts. THE SOUND IS CHEAP. besides, the cord is not so strong."
5,Still one of the best!,"I have had my pair of Sony MDR-7506 for four years now, with really no end in sight. I use these for both small production and DJing and they have been wonderful. The sound is great and packs a pretty good punch. I do own other pairs of headphones that are better in different ways, but these have the best all-round package. They are super durable and very reliable. I'm not sure if these will ever give out, but when they do I will definitely scoop up another pair. I completely recommend these."
2,Need a little help here.,"Please help me to figure out if this Sony Mdr-7506 is defective or they are just create this way.Strange feeling since the beginning(May) until today(Jul), trying to figure what really happened with it.1>unbalance in low frequency, i can feel Right side has more BASS when it go deeper. I can also feel the Right ear pad vibrate more than the left one. If i swift left to right then i feel the opposite.2>I know it takes sometime to burn-in any headphone, it is been two months so i decide to let this 7506 go in a little higher volume(Volume 50,used to 35 with Asus Xonar). From the Right Ear i can hear some noise. The only way i can describe the noise is when you drive at 70MPH and you have a long piece of DuckTape outside the window, and you can hear the ""dadadada"" sound.My knowledge tells me there is something wrong with the Right side, If here got any expert know how to really test a headphone please help a little here.Many Thanks,"
5,Best Headphone ever.,"Great Headphones.. they are the first professional ones I got, and it was worth the money..The only thing you have to keep in mind, is that if you are going to use this headphones outdoor, and by that i mean anyplace that is not your house or office, it can get a little bit bulky ( the cord is 3m) .. so you can only imagine they where made for indoor use.. after all, they are monitor headphones.But a part of that..they are great.. it makes the acoustic sound so good."
5,Sony MDR7506 headphones sound great,"Sony MDR7506 headphones sound great, just what I was looking for in a good old-fashioned ear-muff style pair of headphones."
5,Fantastic Headphones,"I have been using Sennheiser HD280 pro's for a couple years. They are mainly used in my studio, plugged into my keyboard. I wanted a pair of phones to use with my portable dvd player. Holy smokes, what a difference between the two. The HD280's seem ""mellow"" compared to the MDR-7506. The bass is really deep and the high end is sweeter with the Sony's. Great head set for the bucks. I'd buy another in a heartbeat!"
4,Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone,"Good headphones. Sound is clear, no exagerated bass or anything. Slight pressure point on the top of my head, might be the shape of my head, but massaged the head band and fits nicely now. Out of curiosity plugged in my iPod Nano and it worked great with it. Use it to watch movies late at night. Wish the ear cups were a little bigger."
5,Sony HeadPhones,"I read the reviews and am glad I went with these. Other headphones have better spec.'s, but these really deliver! There is nothing better on the market for 3 times the money. You will look at them, feel how light they are, and wonder how they can possibly provide the sound quality (handling the deep bass(s) as well) they do. Buy them and enjoy."
5,Can I give them 6 stars?,"These headphones are simply the best headphones I have ever heard.They are sturdy, they fit excellently, their sound is delicious, and, in the words of the guy who recommended them to me, ""they will blow your eardrums before you blow the speakers out.""Simply put, find a pro audio store or a friend that has these headphones, give them a listen, and then come back and buy them, because that is what you will want to do. They rock."
3,"A ""Good"" choice","These headphones only sound ""O.K."", which is why I gave them three stars. (4 stars is ""Great"", and 5 stars is ""Outstanding""). The low bass is good, but the mid-bass is lacking. The midrange and high-end are slightly exaggerated and strident. Cymbals are unnaturally bright, and the spoken/sung ""S"" letter has too much sibilance in some cases. I have been comparing these headphones with my pair of MDR-V900 headphones. Although the mid-bass of the MDR-V900 is a little muddy compared to these headphones, they don't have the high-midrange to high-end over-exaggeration that the MDR-7506 headphones.These headphones are a decent value, but are not better than ""O.K."". They are adequate for general use. I bought them for my 10 year-old daughter's use with her first MP3 player (a Sansa Fuze). They are wildly better than the earphones I see so many people using.If you want ""great"" to ""outstanding"" headphones, you are well advised to look elsewhere."
2,Poor Condition,"When I received my MDR7506 Headphones, the cord is faulty, and the sound cuts in and out. The actual product when it works is great, but I am going to have to purchase a new cord."
3,"Sound Qualit great, physical quality...not so much","the sound quality of the 7506 is great. I bought this for my daughter and the first day one of the pads came off. I understand why these pads need to be removable so that they can be replaced, but they should not come off on their own. It is quite a chore to install them again."
4,Very good,"Very good sound. very reliable, durable. sliiightly old fashioned design and if you waer for long time your ears may get wet, but overall it is great product."
5,What the pros use,"Not a big huge paragraph, but just chiming in to say I'm glad I bought them. Accurate and capable, lasted a tour in Iraq no problem and it's what I see all of the TV and movie sound guys using."
5,The old pair at work is so good that I bought another pair for home,"I managed to grab a pair of these cans during the closing of a department at work. They've seen a lot of use (try over two years, daily in a professional environment) and they still work perfectly. I don't know what some other people are doing to have connector problems because the one on the old pair is perfect.I've listened to a lot of headphones and these are the best I've ran into that have everything I want. The sound is absolutely beautiful, they fit over my ears and they are comfortable. A lot of the others can do two of the three but this is the first one to pull off the trifecta. So now I've bought a pair for use at my home. I was prepared to spend a lot more money to get a pair of headphones that suited me but the Sony MDR-7506s have it all over their competitors."
5,"12 years on, still flawless","Wanted to share that even after 12 years of decent use, these things are still solid.I'm finally having to replace the ear pads, but loving these to this day."
4,Comfortable and sounds geat,"The only reason I cannot give these a 5star rating is because the cord/plug just gets in the way sometimes. Don't get me wrong, I love the sound, comfort, durability, and everything about these headphones except the cord/plug. I mainly use these while listening to music on my laptop and while playing my guitar, using my miniamp. While on my laptop the plug, or jack, whatever you want to call it, sticks out a little far and I am always worried about breaking it. Wile using my miniamp with my guitar the cord stretches to far down under its own weight and I am worried about tripping over it and possible damaging the plug/jack. Other that these two minor problems, I love these headphones. The sound is amazing, sounds great no matter what I'm listening to and no matter what volume. I have stepped on, sat on, dropped, and abused these and they work flawlessly. Definitely a great investment."
5,Great for radio broadcasting,"I'm a young buck working in radio on the side, and I just ordered a pair. I love them! Far better than anything I've used in the past four years. Works great with our broadcast equipment. So far have tried them out with country music and news/talk radio. The music sounds great, just enough bass and not too much to drive someone mad. I also just did a talk show today and went an hour without taking them off.A guy I work with has used his pair for over ten years and still uses them every night. I am slightly worried about the outside wiring, but I don't think it will be a big problem if they are handled with care."
5,LOVE these headphones,"I use these headphones with my digital piano, and the sound is so amazing that I hardly play my piano out loud."
4,Great if you're not using them to commute.,"Excellent sound, but bulky and has a long curly cord, which can be frustrating if you're commuting with them. Otherwise, I would recommend them."
3,Sony MDR7506 headphones,"I think these are fine headphones for the price and they seem to cancel out almost all external sounds, however, when they arrived they seemed to have a ""screw loose"" in one side and I hear a rattling when I move them around.I am contacting the manufacturer today and hopeful they will send me a new pair.I am using them for recording VO directly from my MAC and I think they will work well once I sort out this problem."
1,Beware 90 day limited warranty,Warranty is only for 90 days. Mine lasted 16 months and then one side stopped working. Sony will charge you more to reapir them than the cost to buy again. So if you want a set of headphones for 90 days them go ahead and purchase these. Sennheiser has a two year warranty. These headphones only have a 90 day limited warranty. Just hope you don't get a bad set.
4,Very very good,"I just got these and they are as described. Very good sound quality.The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is the packaging. Hey, Sony ever hear about the environment and recycling? The packaging is largely made up of an over-the-top selection of plastic that can not be recycled (including some fake silk stuff I just do not get). How about you redesign the package so these excellent headphones stand on their own and are not just one more thing added to the local landfill?"
1,$100 quality,"I bought it August 19th, use it 40 times by half hour, earpad was torn. When I removed it, there is some paper which was torn too. I threw it in garbage can. I do not have time to ask Sony, seller or any other to fix it or replace it."
1,Stopped working within 2 months,"I bought these headphones for my son...who is 19 and listens to shows and music on the computer. He initially loved the headphones and is extremely careful with them.Last night they just flat out stopped working. I am in the process of contacting Sony, since the seller will only replace items for up to a month.My son only had the headphones for 7 weeks!"
2,"Very poor Bass response, try Sennheiser 555 instead","If you want closed design and very comfortable headphones, these are great. I was greatly disappointed with these. I tried breaking them in for over 100 hours.Sound is indeed very clear but the depth is non-existing.I have them currently connected through a 4 channel headphone amp. I have my Senn 555 and 650 connected as well. I use a HK AMP reciever.Music is just too bright on the Sony.If you are only used to earbuds you will not know the difference.So if you listen to hip hop, jazz, rock like dire straits, floyd, you will not like these headphones.If you like all the goodness with depth (bass) try the SennsI see a lot of musicians using these, while recording, looking for flaws, mixing. Well it might be great for them but for rest of us who need to listen and enjoy our music, these are not it."
2,Get ready to be frustrated!!!,"These were a sound engineers standard many years ago. They were considered to have a ""flat response"", which is what most engineers want. Well, they are certainly not a pleasure to listen to or use. Sony even changed the manufacture of the ear pads, and now they fall off constantly. I had to tape mine on to keep them in place.On sound: They definitely aren't a pleasure to listen to, and you will find your ears fatigue quite quickly. I have six different pairs of Pro headphones, and these are definitely my least favorite now. Not only do they sound flat, they have problems all over the frequency spectrum. I got these when I first started working on sound (and didn't know much), this is my second pair bought in an emergency. Ten years on I would never recommend these to anybody. Definitely go for AKG, Ultrasone, Beyerdynamic, or Audio-Technica before you waste money on these cans. I couldn't be more frustrated. At least they are metal."
3,Overhyped,"I read some of the other favorable reviews of Sony's MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphones, and I thought that they were the headphones for me. Alas, beauty is in the ear of the hearer. These headphones, to me, have a tinny sound. That is, they are weak in the bass and too strong in the higher frequencies.It's not all bad though. I adjust the bass and treble controls on my receiver to compensate for the weak bass and too-bright high frequencies. These phones are also reasonably comfortable to wear. I can go 45 minutes or so and not experience the ""vice on my head"" feel that a lot of other headphones can inflict.So I'd recommend that you listen to the Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphones if you can prior to purchase. That way you can decide if they have the sound for you. Depending on your own ears and preference in music, you may love these headphones. For me, they're only fair."
4,"great value, great sound, great product","For this price you can't beat 'em.Sound quality is excellent...I'm not an audiophile, and my hearing isn't good enough to pick up subtle differences between sounds quality and other more expensive headsets (was a Bose owner until I left the dang things on a plane)... These do just fine...I use them for playing guitar...listening to music...watching TV occasionally...no complaints. Well made and fold up into a nice compact form factor for travelling. There are lighter phones out there, but these feel good on the head for over an hour, in my experience."
5,Exceeded expectations. BUY IT!,"After thorough research for the past few months, I was about to buy the MDR V-6. But after closer inspection, and reading NUMEROUS reviews, I settled on the MDR V-7506. I have to say, this is one of the BEST headphone and it is incredibly cheap for something of this caliber. Contrary to what others claim about the ""flat"" sound, that is what music is suppose to sound like when recording. If you honestly want to add more bass, then just change your equalizer settings. But overall, these headphones have allowed me to enjoy the likes of Mahler, Dvorak, and even Coltrane. WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? BUY THE HEADPHONES!"
3,"Expected much, but its OK","I ordered this mount because I liked the look of it with pictures and the fact that it was an universal mount. Since it said ""Universal"" mount, I ordered without a second thought of whether it will fit my Mirage Nanosat speakers or not. To my dismay, it didn't Nanosat comes with an built in keyhole stand, this mount didn't fit it at all. I had to run to home depot to buy some additional bolts to fit it in because, I didn't have to through a return process.If you have Mirage Nanosat - don't buy this. The mount looks good on the ceiling otherwise."
2,Not that easy,The brackets were difficult to mount to wall. The anchor screws pulled loose. The mounting system does not hold the weight of the speaker. The speaker tilts even after tightening.
4,As advertised,"This was exactly what I was looking for. Installed quickly and easily. The only negetive is the $30 price tag for one mount. However, I see no reason why it won't last forwever."
4,Excellent prequel.,"Marion Zimmer Bradley's world, ""Darkover"", came into being as a prism to examine the interactions between a pre-technological culture and a spacefaring ""Terran Empire"". Her first half dozen to a dozen stories set in the world were set in the period after the two cultures met; during those stories, there were some hints that the world of Darkover was a ""Lost Colony"" that had initially been settled by Earthmen, probably unintentionally. This is the story of that beginning to human habitation on the world. It does an excellent job of establishing how the settlement happened, and how their technology was lost. Still, it is from early enough in her career that Bradley's writing style isn't as polished as it later became, so I'll only give it four stars rather than five. For fans of Darkover, this is a must-read; for newcomers to the series, it isn't a bad place to start, even if it isn't where Bradley herself started."
2,"The first Darkover book, chronologically.","The ship has crashed, there's no seeming way off the desolate planet, but still it looks like there's dissention in the ranks. The overly pastoral-minded colonists view this planet as just as good as the one they were on their way to and the spacers just want to GO!The female characters are a little too motherly for my tastes (all overly-feminine acting), but that was the times. Written the year I was born it was, nonetheless, a quite enjoyable read."
5,"Very enthralling read, one of the best authors around.","I have read many of the Darkover novels, and this one answers the questions of where the Darkovans came from and how the ""Christoforos"" came to be. It is also an interesting tale of how people survive crisis situations and get on with life when there is nothing else to do. The added bit with the chieri and the Ghost Wind bringing together some of the main characters and explaining their actions and motivations made it a book that I didn't want to put down until it was finished"
3,"good way to kill time, nothing more.","The book has a mildly entertaining plot and Darkover has a lot of potential as story material, but Darkover Landfall fails to rise beyond mere entertainment to achieve any real literary value. Characters are barely developed, narrative is stilted and predictable, and the story lacks any philosophical or spiritual depth."
4,Good book; tends to pique one's curiosity quickly.,"I first got aquainted with MZB by reading my sister-in-law's MZB's Fantasy magazine. I'm not that into fantasy that much, but I was curious about her writing, since most of the short stories in her magazine aren't hers. I wanted a short book that wouldn't take me long, and once I discovered the Darkover series, I decided to start with the first one. It had me hooked quickly when I discovered the premise was somewhat paralleling some Star Trek/Next Gen books. It kind of made a left turn from where I thought it would go, but it was still an interesting story that has me curious about the other books in the Darkover series. It's a good book for those who enjoy SF and would like to add a little variety to their diet. It is a bit short, so you won't have much time lost if you discover it's not for you. Check it out."
3,get the background,"This is the first Darkover book I read (about 5 years ago), and it got me hooked. I read about a dozen of them, then moved on the some of MZBs newer books. This one is definately not the best of the series, but it is a very intriging introduction to what comes later on the planet Darkover. Start with this one to get some backgound, then move into some of the other early ones, which are great!"
2,"If your not familiar with Darkover, this book with bore you","Short and sweet? Hey I guess this book is a necessary evil, we need to know how humans got to Darkover in the first place. I had to many issues with this book, especially with the cheri. So they boinked a human and now we have Hastur's? And Father Valentine, I'm still not sure whether I liked the fact that he was sexually repressed (like most preists) or hated him because he was the founding spiritual leader (St. Valentine of the Snows?) And I really didn't care for any of the characters. This book must've been written by a ""Freind of Darkover"" because it lacked depth. Alright ""Salt"" was a really good ""FoD"" story. If you feel like you have to read this book."
5,Best science fiction series ever,"I recommend that a new reader of science fiction in general or of Marion Zimmer Bradley begin with this book, since it is chronologically the first Darkover novel. The series is my all time favorite, closely followed by the Riverworld series of Pilip Jose Farmer and the Dune Series. Anyway, the best book of all is ""The Heritage of Hastur"" but they are all terrific. MZB liked ""The Heritage of Hastur"" best, herself, I remember reading somewhere. This is a REAL science fiction series, not a fantasy series, and it is the best of the best."
5,Good place to start...,"I'd never read any other Darkover novels and I thought this one was great. It really got my interest and now I'm totally hooked. If you want a series that'll draw you in, start here."
4,Good Introduction to Human Resource Management,"This book takes a modular approach to teaching you HR Management. You can read almost any module independently of the others and there are lots of reference material to each module, including interesting websites. I'd recomend this book to anyone interested in learning more about management in general, and HR management in special."
4,Sound is great....size a bit smaller,Used to add surround sound to home theater. Sound is great....size a bit smaller than I expected but still a great sound. The installation is quite easy as well ...Price is also reasonably ok.
4,Very pleased for the price,"For an inexpensive pair of speakers, I'm happy with the way these sound. My home sound system is pretty basic, and these work very well for that. For the most part, the installation was trouble free. Please note I did rate these as an economical set of speakers NOT in comparison to higher priced sets of speakers."
3,KNIFE NOT AS SHOWN,"The knife I received is not the knife shown on Amazon.It is a very nice Shun knife, but it is not an Alton's Anglesknife. The knife shown on Amazon had Alton Brown's logo on it, this one does not. I bought this gift as a birthday present for my husband who is a huge fan of Alton Brown's. I was told by customer service the Alton's Angles knife is not available anymore. If so, Amazon should not show his image on it."
3,Love this Knife But..............................,"First off...take the stock picture of this knife off the webmy wife is a huge fan of alton brown even has his shun logo tattooed on her four armi bought this knife thinking it had alton browns signature on it.i just got it today beautiful knife but, no alton brown im very unhappy about that.someone needs to do something about this...."
5,Monsieur Poet Deluxe!,"Having studied with Tom Lux, I am a big fan of his poetry. Joel Brouwer, who also studied with Lux, is a fan too. However, Brouwer's poetry is not a shadow or copy of Lux's. It has grown with the help of Lux's light, but it is its own garden - overgrown with fantastic weeds and bionic flowers. Brouwer's poetry is also more political than Lux's. It makes me laugh out loud and find hope in a pretty hopeless world. I read Lt. Schrapnel at a Poets for Peace reading and it rolled off my tongue like liquid bullets. Brouwer is my favorite living poet and this book is no exception. Tangibly thin, like a passport, it sure packs a poetic whopper of a punch of his wild vision, love of language, heart of goofy gold, and his gut of wit and fire. I can't wait for his next book, CENTURIES. I am not surprised that he just won a prestigious Whiting Prize. He deserves a seat beside Whitman, Berryman, Cummings, Flook, and yes, Lux. BRAVO!"
2,"Predictable Workshop humour, moves, flair","I won't go as far as to say that Joel Brouer is a bad poet or that many out there won't like this book. Some poeple will love it. People love Tom Lux's work, I like much of Tom Lux's work too. But I really don't see what Brouwer has to offer anyone that Lux hasn't already. And the weight of influence is heavy in these poems.This is a common problem in first books, but to add to that Brouwer doesn't have Lux's imagination or flair for intricate turns of a phrase. In many poems, such as Steve's Commando Pinball I am left going ...so? A smart annecdote does not a poem make."
3,Exactly Like Lux,"This is an interesting book--funny, witty, and entertaining. Brouwer owes a hell of a lot to his mentor, Lux, at Sarah Lawrence though. Many of the poems share the same idea-driven approach to poetry that Lux has mastered. Poems like ""Yoctosecond"" and ""Lt. Shrapnel"" are carbon copies of the Lux style. Amazing that a teacher would let his student get away with mimicing his voice like this. Still, if you like Lux's work...."
5,Most pleasant surprise,"If you are apprehensive about purchasing an author's first work, as I was, don't be in this case. Joel Brouwer's book is absolutely delicious. His short poems can pack an emotional punch that will leave the reader going over the poem, or a line in the poem, again and again. And if you get a chance to hear him read, don't miss him. His reading is articulate, mesmerizing, and fun. Get this book and enjoy."
1,Bearings? We dont need no stinkin' bearings!,"I bought these casters to use on a lunmber cart in my garage/workshop. I bought them because I thought that the high profile wheel would deal with grit on the floor pretty well. I can't believe how bad they are. The ""bearings"" are so worthless that the casters physically grind as you spin them- even without any weight on them. Rortaion of the wheel is OK, but spinning the caster on it's axis is terrible. This is a case of you get what you pay for. I'll be buying replacements somewhere else.The wheel itself seems to be the same material as a rollerblade wheel. That part ought to hold up OK. However, the bearings just aren't up to snuff."
5,Great Wheels,"I bought these for a mobile workbench that I built and they work great. I have inline wheels on one side and these on the other. The bench turned out great, I can move it anywhere I want. I have gotten a lot of compliments on it as well."
4,I like the wheels,"I have not installed the castors yet, but they look and roll in my hand very well.I would buy them again."
3,Steelex D2608 3-inch caster,"These casters are just okay for most applications. Not really heavy duty (HD), but will work on light equipment/cabinets. The lock works fine, but the steel is noticeably lighter than a REAL HD 3"" caster and the axle is only about 1/4"" vs approx 3/8"" on a HD one (remember that all Pacific Rim imports are metric). Wheels are rounded like donuts and don't ride on a wide flat surface. I bought them to compare to a set of HD casters I got at a local woodworking show which cost almost double. I am currently using them on a plywood dolly to hold my portable planer w/stand. It's only used occasionally so I have not had any problems except the wheels are a bit loose & wobbly on the axles. Overall, just okay."
5,Awesome,I have 6 of these on a DIY table saw mobile base. Work great. Table does not move at all when locked down. The wheel and the swivel lock wich is a feature I have only found on these.
3,Steelex Castors,I am pleased with the castors with the exception of stability. The locking system allows a little too much movement. I would still buy them anyway.
2,Poor quality wheels,"The wheels seem to be sub-par in quality. In the set of 4 that I ordered, one would barely rotate. The certainly are over-rated as far as weight capacity. I returned them for a refund and ordered better ones online from Caster City. Yes, I paid more but the new wheels are well worth the cost."
5,"Great product, Good price.","Puchased two caster wheels to modify my toolbox into a roll-a-way. Wheels are very durable, mounting plate constructed very well. I would recommend these to a friend."
4,"No filler, all content, still looking for the secret remote codes","Talk about investment - I paid $32 at Borders five years ago. Now that is a rate of return!But I won't part with it. The DVD reminds you of why Tool is an art metal band, emphasis on art. Everytime I watch Stinkfist (""Track #2"" to the MTVheads), I see something new in it.The live songs are quite excellent. I first heard the ""No Quarter"" cover on a college radio station, driving about midnight on the Illinois-Missouri border. It turned a dark, dimly-lit, desolate drive into an ethereal experience.It's also neat to feel the growth toward Lateralus, with songs becoming less angry (as on Aenima) and more pondering, more inward-looking."
4,"Difficult, but worth it","This stock was difficult to fit into my carver one, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. I had to use some sandpaper to adjust the fitting of the grooves so I could get it into the marker. I then cranked the marker case together to secure it, and it was solid. There is absolutely no movement between the stock and the marker, no matter how hard I shake/bump/run headlong into trees that I swear weren't there a minute before. I have long arms, so I use it fully extended, at 11.5"" past the end of the marker. For those of you with shorter arms, it has stops at 10.75"", 10"", 9"", 8.25"", and finally 7.5"", which is a length selection that should suit all needs. It is relatively lightweight and has a nice high-friction back to the stock so it won't slip off your arm when you run and gun. Overall a very good stock and well worth the money."
3,It could be worse.,"I had the same problems as another commenter: the hole for the spring was too small, and it was ridiculously hard to fit the stock into the gun.The way I solved the spring-hole problem was by taking a drill to it. As I discovered, it wasn't that the entire hole was too small -- instead, the hole had sort of ""caved in"" at the top. So the once the drill took out that extra little bit of plastic, the spring fit perfectly.For getting the stock to fit in the grooves, I ended up just forcing it in by using a long screw to bridge the gap and drawing the two halves of the gun closed. It didn't seem to hurt it and it fits fine now, though it was a bit of a struggle.Another thing is that the stock rattles a bit -- the extendable shaft is not flush with the rest of the stock. Luckily, however, it does not rattle when you hold it to your shoulder.It's not the best product in the world -- but then again, it's certainly one of the cheapest."
5,"SMART PURCHASE, WILL IMPROVE YOUR PERFORMANCE",I have a Tippman 98 Custom and this was one of the first things I purchased to modify it. This stock is sweet and makes the marker look much more like a assualt rifle. It also considerably increases your accuracy. I also recommend that you purchase a coiled remote so you can carry your air tank on your body and not attached to your gun. This will allow you to be much more flexible in your movement because you are not lugging aroung this 5 lb tank. This stock seems to be made very well and can take a beating. I think this is a good buy.
4,Tippman stock gets the job done.,"It is a very nice stock. I have it on a custom ""Deadly Wind"" Mil-sim body for my Ion. It looks nasty. it comes straight off the back of the body. Im'm a pretty big guy. for comfort, I would have maybe done better with a drop down stock. other than that, no complaints about the product. Well worth the money."
2,Great Stock But Bad Machines,This stock is great i just got it in the mail today. However! It sucks so badly because it does not fit my tippmann 98 custom platinum series marker. I was careless enough to not fully read the reviews since the rating was this high. it does not fit what so ever. Hopefully i can file down the edges of it so it will fit the marker. if not i am going to return it because the idiots who made this dont look at there reviews just a little tweek and they can fix it. I suggest if you want to get a good stock but not that expensive get this but you will have to probably alter it for a while to get it to work. 2 stars just because i have to fix it.
3,Okay,Overall i like this stock very much now tht is on my 98 custom...it wabbles abit but is great. The instalation requires taking the whole gun apart with was a confusing process. All in all buy it because it is alot cheaper than alot of other stocks and is of good quality.
1,98 custom/custom pro collapsiable stock,I didn't like the fact hat they sent me the wrong stock. They sent me he tippmann phenom x7 stock.
1,Bait and switch,"This is NOT made by TIPPMANN as you may assume by the description. I'm not sure who makes it.It's a quality part and worth the money, but not a TIPPMANN official product."
2,Not for ACT 98's,I bought this for my 98 custom with ACT (anti chop tech) and the hole for the spring was not right and after drilling the whole the gun would then get caught sometimes and not blow back. After using the gun for awhile this resolved itself. The big con is that the stoke is not sturdy and jiggles a lot and I expected more for what I paid for this.
3,You may need this.,"B""HIf you are tall you will need this upgrade. Not too difficult to install in a 98C."
4,Amazing stock for the price!,"I just recently picked up this stock for my 98 Custom Pro and so far I'm loving it. It fights tight to my shoulder and is still versatile enough to switch up the lengths during a paintball session. The ONLY reason I'm giving this a 4 out of 5 is due to the threads that come on this stock. I honestly had to play around with the stock for 2 hours in order for it to fight snug onto my gun. In order for it to fit, you have to shave off the inside of the threads slightly. Someone stated in the previous reviews that you can just twist it 350 degrees back and forth in the butt of the gun to make it fit securely. Also you have to drill into the bolt hole that is given because it'll be too small for a 98 Custom pin to fit into. Once I made those 2 slight adjustments, it went on perfectly. All in all, if you do buy this, there is a little work needed into fitting the stock onto the gun properly. JUST KNOW THAT IN ADVANCE BEFORE YOU BUY IT."
2,Dissapointed,"I have a Platinum series Custom 98 ACT from Tippmann and knowing that this stock worked with the ACT models I ordered it. I took my marker apart and went to install it only to find that it doesn't fit right. The drive spring doesn't even fit the hole. Actually the ACT spring was the only thing that fit right. So I went ahead and drilled the drive spring hole a little wider and dremeled the sides of the stock so it would fit better. I put my marker back together and I have to say that thing is not going anywhere. Mainly because it doesn't the way it should. However, the butt of the stock wobbles from side to side. The butt isn't coming off from the wobbling, it is just a minor nuisance.In all it does what it is meant to do though. What should be a 2-3 min install, depending on how good you are at taking the marker apart, took me 30+ mins. If you are on a budget and don't mind having to do some tool work on it, then get this one. Other wise I suggest looking into other models."
4,Decent but not great,I ordered this knowing that it wouldn't be great for the price but it is pretty good. Doro sent a Rap4-branded stock. I mounted it on a US Army Carver One and had to force the sides together and shave the plastic on the stock a little. It is not an exact fit but for the price I was willing to make it work.
3,good but noisy,"This stock is good and provides good balance to any 98. I have an old school model 98, I had to shave a little bit of the opening to make it fit but after tht it fit fine. It does rattle when i run with the gun but overall a good add on to any 98."
1,Horribly made stock.,"When I first tried to install this stock, the hole for the main guide rod/spring was too small, so I had to basically drill it to be larger. Then the next time I tried to install it, the guide rod fit, however, it would not fit into the receiver on the gun! The Tippmann receiver has two slots, with two corresponding rings on the stock to fit in. However, the part of the stock right after the rings is too close, and so gets in the way of any attempt to install the stock. I'm going to have to fix that as well.It's unacceptable that such a common item, for such a common gun, would have such clear errors."
4,Works well until you add a mask.,"Installed this on my T-98 with no problems. My 98 is a base model, so I can't guarantee that it will work as well with other models. Be careful installing and do not lose any springs like I almost did. Looks great and without the mask there isn't a problem, but as soon as I tried with my mask I hit a glitch. Sighting is almost impossible. I really like the stock, so I will be putting a riser and red-dot on it, but if you plan on using the built in sights, this stock is not for you.Pros:AdjustableSolidFits stock 98Cons:Cannot sight once you put your mask on."
3,i guess i got a bad one,i have a us army carver one and it didnt fit. it took a very long time to shave down the ridges to fit it in the gun. now it fits and works fine. but hey i got it for $6 from here
3,Pretty much like other reviews,"this product fit perfectly into my carver one paintball gun, but it was loose even when you tightened the marker frame around the stock. I fixed this problem buy inserting an o-ring into one of the slots where the stock is held in place buy the frame, though the o-ring had to be about the size of your pinky in diameter and it worked nice and snug after I titghtened it down.not to impressed with this product because the stock I bought originnaly from dunhams sporting goods fit alot better with no problems except its high price for 49.99"
2,Wobbled like crazy,"This thing wobbles way too much for me to like it. First of all you have to take the entire gun apart to put it on. But the mount that the stock is on wobbles, and the stock wobbles on that mount. This stock is too flimsy."
4,Great Stock!,"I am brand new to ballin and this was easy to install for me. Didn't have to do any ""shaving"" or ""whole poking"" to get it to fit. Slid in just fine! Plus it looks awesome! I really like the feel it gives. I have been using my 20 oz. CO2 as a stock and that wasn't near as comfortable as this. The only thing I can think of that might be a negative is that I noticed a slight ""ting"" sound after it shoots. I may have put on wrong but please comment if you know the fix for this! Thanks"
2,Looks cool,"I got this last year for my 98c, and after playing with it installed for a few days, it seemed to me like it was kind of unecessary and even got in the way because of the added bulk to the gun. It makes it more difficult, depending on the size of your mask, to look down the barrel of the gun. Paintball guns really dont have a whole lot of kick, and i usually just use the tank to help steady my aim if i need it anyway.Overall: looks cool, but impractical."
2,rap4 stock sucks,"they sent me a rap4 stock that doesnt fit right. the hole for the spring was too small so i had to make the hole bigger. the gun shell would not close properly because the stock was a little too big. i had to bang my marker halves together till the plastic on the stock starts to shave and mold to the shell. i have a few rap4 products and let me tell yah, the quality is not there. i would give this a one star but since i end up being able to put the stock in i give it two."
2,Does not fit Tippmann 98 custom,This doesnt fit into the back of my tippmann 98 custom properly. I had to sand the plastic down in order to be able to close my gun. Other than that...it does what it says. 98 Custom stock and it looks and feels great.
4,it is pretty good,i just got mine it took about 4 days to get here so not bad i had no problem puttin it on my gun it just can turn like around and i had it right the first time but i had to take it back apart for something else and then when i put it back together it can lik turn around and i have no idea what the problem is so if anyone knows please tell me what the problem is but great add on to your gun i love it....
5,HELP,I don't know how-to install this i just got a tippman 98 custom and i don't know to install please put up a customer review involving installation
5,great price decent stock.,This is a great addition to your gun good for BT 4 combats. Like most reviews have said you need to make the hole wider for the spring but that's simple enough. The only problems with the stock is it rattles and the butt of the stock is rough but these issues aren't a big deal.
3,Good but not Tippmann,"Just installed this stock and it seems pretty decent but it's definitely NOT a Tippman product, says RAP4 right on the side.The middle hole(for ACT) was there for me but was to small. Easy to fix though. Just make sure you don't drill it any deeper than it should be.I used this site for installation instructions:[...]I rated down as it's not a Tippmann product as the sellers page indicates and the hole was to small. Also because the stock wiggles around the shaft a little. Shouldn't be a problem, but feels looser than I'd want it to be."
3,its ok,"the shipping was good i got it sooner than i the estimate was. But when i got to my desk and took my tippman apart to put the stock on it i ran into a few problems, one there was a small notch on one of the grooves and it wouldn't let me put the stock in then when i cut that piece out and i put the other side of the marker i noticed that it wouldnt fit so i sanded it a little wider. i got it to fi but there is a tiny tiny gap on the pistol grip part of the marker. one other thing when you have the stock to the sixth position its a bit loose and moves around might not bug some people but i dont like when parts on my marker wobble around. overal its ok if you wanna put in a little bit of work."
2,You'll get what you pay for,"Buy this if you don't mind a wobbly stock with incredibly loose tolerances - at least 1mm of daylight showing between extension tube and buttstock. Rattles up, down, side to side, and back and forth. Even tried putting some cloth tape inside and the stock still wobbled all over. It is inexpensive though, and for that it gets two stars. I threw this one back."
2,NOT Complete!,"I got the product and when i tried to attach it to my tippmann Thats when i realized its missing a part,""its incomplete"" I acctually looked and compared it to the exact model at a local retail store and its missing an attachment that links it to the paintball gun and allows you to fold and unfold the butt."
4,CAR stock for Tippmann 98 and BT-4 markers,"I installed this on my daughters BT-4 (98C mount) and found the item a good deal for the price. No, it's not 'military grade' but it IS well made and solid. The item fit perfectly and the position selector is nice and tight. Very little wobble between stock shaft and buttpiece. For $16 shipped you can't beat it. I purchased a 'higher grade' metal CAR stock for triple the money and except for some metal fittings it's not THAT much better. Highly recommend this item!"
5,"excellent, but not without flaws","this stock is awesome. in terms of function, it does exactly what it is supposed to do. The feel and build are awesome, and it complement the marker nicely.however, it is worth mentioning that it did not fit into my tippmann without a fight. there were two problems, both of which were easy fixes.the first problem was that the cocking spring did not fit into the precut hole in the stock. solution: take the largest allen key that comes with the gun, and use it as a drill bit to drill the hole larger. worked surprisingly well.the second problem was that the two notches that hold the stock in the gun did not fit perfectly. solution: press the stock into the gun the way it should and rotate it, using the metal hide of the gun to rub away the extra plastic. makes for a perfect fit.once i accomplished both of these, the stock functioned perfectly.because the fixes were so easy, and the product is so excellent, i didnt see the need to dock it any stars."
5,Nice Add-On to 98 Custom,"Shipped fast and arrived undamaged. Adds a more rifle aspect to the marker and overall sleekness. Can also add a sling if wanted. If you want something other than an out of the box 98, this isn't a bad upgrade but it is also available in a kit (sight rail and barrel and foregrip)."
3,"Good, but not for ACT","Great stock, but don't buy if you have the ACT version marker. There is an extra hole in the 98's stock butt cap for the ACT spring mechanism and this stock didn't have it. I drilled my own hole and it works fine, but it was a little difficult getting the right spot and right depth hole. For non-ACT this should be fine."
1,"Awesome Product, but not compatible with facemask","I was very impressed with the build quality of this stock, and it was relatively straightforward to install. However, it makes it impossible to aim while wearing the standard paintball facemask, your head has to be turned nearly sideways. works great without a facemask, but then you obviously wouldn't be playing paintball without one!! I've since removed it from my marker so I can aim. Pretty disappointed when I realized this stock would preclude aiming, because otherwise it's pretty sweet!"
3,ok with some problems,"i orered this stock on a saturday and got it on monday, i have a newer platinum series tippmann 98c, there was 1 problem with the hole in the middle, it was to small and the pin wouldnt fit in hole so i took an allen wrench and routeed it out and then everything was fine it took all of 2 mins then i was set"
3,Custom pro,Works great for custom pro. Makes it feel like an assault rifle. Completely adjustable. I found that the face mask touches the stock which prevents u from looking down the marker. Recommended for experienced players
3,"It is alright, especially if you like to sand things","I bought this product for a tippmann 98 custom kit. The worse thing about this product was the stock connection did not fit into the custom 98!! I had to spend atleast 2-3 hours sanding the part in order to try and get it to fit, and I express the words try to fit. After 3 hours were up, I began to used force to close the tippmann with the stock attached. Currently, the stock is attached and it looks nice. But, I know that this product was not manufactured correctly!!In conclusion, it took a very long time to get this stock attached but with much sanding and force, the product did what it was intended to do.Hope this review is somewhat helpful."
4,"Pretty good, but needed some drilling in the stock","The product quality is pretty good. However, my only complaint was that I needed to re-drill the holes (that were already in the stock) because the pin and the springs on the bolt. After minimal drilling the spring and the pins fit right in."
2,Does it job.. however,Yes it works its a nice stock so i can rest the gun easier into my shoulder... HOWEVER I HAD TO FRIKIN use my bolt pull back pin and place it in a drill as a makeshift drill bit and drill/sand the plastic off the tip (where it inserts behind the bolt) to make it FIT!?!? IT SAYS IT IS FOR TIPPMANN 98 CUSTOM tell me WHY IT DOES NOT FIT !?!? also i had to add duct work tape as well as electrical tape so it doesn't wobble and make noise all over the place lol... So if you want a fixer upper and take some time putting it on your gun this is for you.. i bought it because it was cheaper.. probably still would buy it again but it seems to have false advertisement saying it is made for the gun considering it does not fit out of the box... noobs... also it says RAP4 on the side if that makes a difference to anyone its black not very noticeable.... might be a knock off or something.
1,Don't Bother,"We have purchased the Wind 'n Go flashlights in the past and have found them to work quite well, so this lantern was a big disappointment. After three solid minutes of winding, which is very tedious and uncomfortable on the hands, neither the radio nor the light worked even for 5 minutes. We made several attempts, each time with the same pathetic results. Buy the flashlights instead. We are returning this lantern."
2,Hand crank broke after very limited use,"Seemed like a great purchase when I got it-- it gave off plenty of light for my camping purposes, and the radio was a nice perk. However, I'd only taken it on 2 trips (for a combined total of less than 2 weeks' use) in 2 years, and was at home re-winding it to recharge it when the handle simply stopped working-- specifically it seemed to disconnect from the charging mechanism on the inside and the handle became sluggish and ineffective. Peeking inside, I could see that whatever had broken was beyond my basic handyman's ability to fix.This WOULD be a great product, and it actually looks & feels durable, but for the hand crank to break while CHARGING normally seems to be a pretty bad design flaw. I'm now trying to get a replacement from Athena, the manufacturer, but am not too hopeful because the 1 year warranty has expired (never mind that the product was only used for 1-2 weeks total)."
3,almost like the real thing,Works exactly as described BUT is not as good lantern as one with an adjustable flame and is not as bright as some of the old fashioned single light bulbs. The trade off is the ability to not run out of fuel
4,A true blessing,"I enjoyed every page of this book. The main character, Brenna, was a model witness to those around her, and her faith was strong. This fictional character is entertaining, however, I believe that Al Lacy, the author, is trying to also give us an example to follow. I always found myself smiling when she would share the gospel to others even if they were reluctant to hear. Overall, this story was a spiritual inspiration and a well written story."
3,Not the best...,"Although I am only half way through this story, I am not yet very interested. I could see it potentially being interesting, but so far, it just drones on. I also dislike the strong reliegous nature of it."
4,Some of the best tasting mints,"Love these. My brother is a mint junkie, and these were a gift. Fun container, and very tasty mints. Good flavor without being overwhelming or giving you mouth burn."
1,I hate it,The product I received was different from what it's on the picture. and i returned it for a money back. Please contact the seller to return my money ASAP
2,not for beginner,I bought this DVD hoping to learn how to play chords on piano or keyboard. With three years of piano lessons I was able to kind of follow the instructor. It's definitely not for beginner. I learned some new music theory. Each topic would be better if the instructor includes familiar songs to demonstrate or examplify. Overall I would not recommend this to eager learner or those who are looking for introductory or systematic instructions to learning piano or keyboard.
1,"Piano Lessons, learning the Piano keyboard","Pete Sears is a good piano player, he is not a good piano teacher. I already play guitar, and I wanted to learn about the piano keyboard(as per his title) like I learned the guitar fretboard. His delivery is slow and boring, he spends too much time playing piano rather than teaching piano. I went through only about 1/4th his lesson from the start and quit because I lost interest for the reasons stated above.I don't feel like Amazon owes me a refund, but if I had purchased directly from Pete, I would ask him for a refund. HRE"
3,"Good, for those with a good attention span.","I only recommend this for people with good attention spans. While the teacher is an accomplished pianist with lots of information to offer, he's not very effective at keeping your interest for long periods of time. If you're looking for an upbeat, exciting DVD that will entertain you while its teaching you, don't look here."
3,Gotta Mind to Travel is much better,"If you have heard ""Travel"" and you are looking for something completely different, this might work for you. The direction was a little too different for me."
3,"Dirty Deal, Coco Montoya",I'm not a huge fan of this music genre. That said this is a solid effort by Montoya. It met my expectations.
4,"Predictable, but worth a listen","I've been a Coco fan for many years and truly appreciate his soulful voice and guitar chops. Dirty Deal is a solid offering from Coco, but as I ssaid in the title, the song are a little predictable and not quite as dynamic as some of his earlier offerings. Don't get me wrong, it's still an enjoyable listen, just less poignant than the older stuff.3.5 stars"
4,"RICK ""SHAQ"" GOLDSTEIN SAYS: ""COCO"" IS ""OK!"" ""OK!""","This CD is well worth buying. But to you blues aficionado's who rely on Shaq's recommendations, let me put it in terms you'll understand. Coco is no SRV, or an Albert, or a Buddy. He's definitely a large step below them. But he is also not a lounge singer type like Smokin Joe Kubek, Lil Ed and the Blue Imperials, etc. Coco, is a large step above them. This CD seems to pick up steam with each song. He shows his flexibility with different types of guitar playing on a number of songs. He performs a great ballad, with a Johnny Copeland, song (#6), that's 5 minutes and 59 seconds long. (I could have said 6 minutes, but Shaq don't fool around when it comes to da blues!) NEW, GOOD BLUES IS HARD TO FIND, and till ""Jumping Joe"" Bonamassa dedicates more of his recordings to true electric blues, this is one of the best of the last year, along with Walter Trout's ""Full Circle""."
4,electric blues for everyone,"you can put this cd just very near to previous by coco on your shelf. long electric guitar solos, nice songs and good virtuosity. not very good singing, a coloured singer could have done much better. but the whole recording is enjoyable and you can buy it, like i did for this and all the previous by montoya. if you like white blues from british mayall school, this is a recording for you."
1,Over rated for its capacity of 300 pounds,Very thing material. Comapring to those available in local HD & LS this one should be rated no more than 200 pounds. I would return it if I had no one to give away for a light load.
3,Not 300 lb capable,"If your planning on rolling only on solid concrete without door thresholds, cracks, etc. This is the caster for you! If theres a pebble in the way count on the caster failing. My first one failed with 2 days. So I purchased 2 of the ridgid casters with the same result"
3,Famous Buildings of Frank Lloyd Wright,Guess i should have read the 'small print'. I did not realise this was a colouring book.....and the postage cost as much as the book !!
5,Frank Lloyd Wright,"My young son has become entranced with Wright and his work. This was a good introduction to the architect and his work, a book I also have enjoyed, and it did stimulate his interest so much that we are doing a road trip to Falling Water in the late winter"
2,Banal and Incomplete,This book reads like an advertisement for the perfumes rather than realexpert critical analysis. He also completely omits men's fragrances for some reason. Also men and women can share fragrances and he doesn't even allude to that. All this added up to a very incomplete and disapointing read. I'm glad I didn't spend too much money on it.Luca Turin's guide is greatly superior- Buy that.
3,Just a warning,"At the time I write this Amazon lists James Benning as the director. Just a warning this is not O Panama from Benning which I was expecting, in fact I would be very surprised to discover that Benning had anything to do with it. Instead it is a generic documentary about the Panama canal. Hopefully this will keep others from making the same mistake.So if you are looking for a Benning film, skip this one. If you are here looking for a generic documentary about the Panama canal then this might be the film for you.(I apologize for rating this three stars I only watched 5 minutes of it, but Amazon won't let me write this review without rating it)."
4,Liked it,"This is a fun record. Sounds like Ace is having a blast recording with his friends. Fantastic guitars as always with Ace, and some good vocals. I enjoyed his version of Hide Your Heart."
3,Pretty good...could be better,"The sunglasses look pretty good but I find that when I'm driving they glare up a lot which seems pretty dangerous while driving. I guess they just aren't as high quality as some other brands. However, since the price is so slow, I really don't have any problems with it. Not a great buy, but not a bad deal"
3,Inexpensive but not bad,"These are pretty good sunglasses...a good value.I like the 3 colors red, gold and blue and they are quality constructed.Here in Seattle, where a sunshiny day is celebrated as a special event rather than an occurance its nice to have these aviator styled glasses and they look good on me so who's to know that they are not a pair of overpriced sunglasses.The G&G; people have a good product and they even include a soft carrying case (cloth) that says its also good for cleaning glasses which it does.If I am not stepping on, sitting on or misplacing them I am extremely hard on sunglasses and these puppies look like they can take anything that is thrown at them within reason probably not a line drive or anything like that but they are good. Glad I got em.I will never understand why anyone would pay over a hundred dollars for a pair of sunglasses."
3,"Worth the price, but not good for driving use","What can you expect for a $5 glass, it's mirrored and not seems so cheap. However, it's too dark when you wear it for driving, it's hard to see the cars from your left and right at the intersection."
1,Not worth the price,"I was not expecting anything high quality, but with shipping this set cost me around 18 bucks. The product is not worth that much. These sun glasses are worth about 99 cents a pair, so you are better off just going to the 99 cent store."
3,"Exactly as described, Im a pilot and they work well.",I ordered these sunglasses because of all of the reviews and I am a pilot. I like the chrome glasses the best but they work very well for viewing my instruments up there in the sun.
5,Very happy with these sunglasses,"I've only tried the one pair - silver - so far but these sunglasses are great. Very comfortable, adjustable, and makes the sun easy on your eyes. I highly recommend."
3,for the price decent,I loose sunglasses frequently. for the price great for wearing to the beach or out drinking where sunglasses are easily lost.
5,Nice Shades!,I'm really happy with my aviators..... and having a couple back-ups is never a bad thing.
5,Stunna Shades,"These are some of the best shades I have ever picked up. They feel no different than other pairs that are 50+ dollars in price. For about $6 a piece, you can't go wrong with this purchase. 5 star seller, 5 star product."
4,Cool Hand Luke would be envious,"Really good sunglasses. Very retro and the spring hinges saved me from breaking them several times. However, the box they came in was a little busted up. They did ship out quick which was awesome, plus you get 3 for the price of 1! Smart, sleek buy."
5,Worth the purchase,"It actually came earlier than anticipated and came with a little sleeve to put one of them in,to clean and protect it."
3,You can't go wrong for the price,I was not expecting much for the price and 3 pair wow they are defeintly not the best sunglasses their is very light and flimsy but I lose sunglasses all the time so I don't really care but let's hope they dont break before I can lose them lol I will up date after I start using them for a wile.
4,nice glasses,this glasses don`t look cheap and are really cool.. my brother and i use it.. we like it a lot
3,Good for a one time use,These sunglasses looked amazing. The only reason they have gotten 3 stars instead of 5 is due to the fact that mirror film rubbed off. My usage was very low - I wore them maybe 10 times but without the mirror lens that just aren't wearable anymore.
4,Good product,"I've been looking for new sunglasses for a while, and being the frugal cheap son-of-a-gun I am, I was curious at the thought of three pairs of glasses for $10, but a bit apprehensive at the same time.Pro's;-Cheap-Look great-Don't pinch the bridge of my nose-Nice and big-The bag was a nice touch-No scratches on the lenses or frames, unlike others-Delivery speed was fantasticCon's-Was expecting darker lenses based on other reviews-Feel a big fragile-Sometimes slide down my nose a bit-Could have been wrapped better for more protection from rough handling, not sure a single plastic bag would do the trick"
3,not for fat-heads....,"many previous reviewers commented that these glasses were fairly large, and if you had a larger head they would fit quite well. these people are wrong. someone told them they had a large head as part of cruel joke of some kind. if you have a lagitimately large cranium these glasses will make you look ridiculous...."
3,Good but not Great,I got the black hinged aviators and they were built rather cheap. A couple days after I bought these the lenses started to scratch and the nose pieces fell off so I got rid of that pair and then the hinges (which are very thing by the way) broke. I would suggest getting a single pair or a double pack but three is just cheap.
5,pretty pleased...,"I ordered the product on the 30th and it arrived two days later! they look great too, and with a little adjustments to fit your head they are worth the price!"
4,"Good, Could Be Better, But Good.","I bought the three chrome-framed mirrored aviators and I Was Moderately Impressed with my order. I already gave one pair away, and I still have two, so its good to have more than one. They are very, very dark, so their not recommended for driving. So if their going to be given as a gift to a Pre-teen or teenager, they'd be perfect. Also, the ""silicon"" nose pads are really just plastic. They look awesome, they're very dark ,and don't wear 'em inside. If your obsessing over getting aviators, your search is over. P.S. Your eyes are completely invisible to others if your wearing them."
2,"Look good, not functional","These mirrored aviators look cool as all hell, and they're cheaper than most drugstore sunglasses. That's the upside.But if you're looking for SUN glasses, look elsewhere. These lenses are horrible and actually increase, instead of reduce, glare. The lenses are also way too dark and block out almost all light. Not good for walking, let alone driving.The black frames have the darkest lenses, which provide an almost ""midnight"" effect. This leads to one very good point about the manufacturer, G&G; great customer service.I contacted the company because the lenses in the black frames were so dark and useless. Their rep, Gary, immediately sent me out a replacement pair of amber lenses, which are only marginally better.In summation; great look, great price, great customer service, horrible lenses.You get what you pay for."
4,"Look Great, Extra Quick Shipping","VERY quickly shipped, they look good as well except they are a little smaller than I imagined for aviators."
3,Cheap but alright,"The glasses I ordered for my fiance were supposed to come in chrome, gold, and black. He got 3 in chrome which was a huge disappointment. He says they are really dark too. He still wears them though."
4,Cool sunglasses for an unbeatable price!,"I bought these for my cool 31-year old brother who lives in Florida. He flipped for them and then my cool 29-year old brother begged for a pair as soon as he saw them. While the plastic wrapping they come in is kinda ghetto, the glasses are not. They look WAY more expensive than they are. They look very similar to the Ray-Ban aviators which cost hundreds. One of the best attributes of these glasses it the thin side frames - often, cheaper sunglasses have thick, unsightly, and cheapo sides. These are sturdy, fashionable, yet rugged glasses. My favorites are the silver mirrored...but only by a slight margin."
5,Look nice and affordable,"I just ordered a set of the black framed ones....for the third time in the last two years. I'm really bad with losing sunglasses so at least these are pretty cheap. I really like how they look, they fit well after you adjust them. The first two times I bought these the company was quick to ship them and they got to me very quickly. I would recommend anyone that likes aviators (and loses them easily) to get these. I just get the black framed ones again, but there's a nice variety of colors to choose from."
4,a little big,"idk if its just my face or something, but when I first put them on they seemed awful big. They also sit kinda high, the last pair I had (broke em) were smaller enough that the tops of my eyebrows could be seen over the top frame..not so with these. Its really nothing much though, I'm getting used to them already. And the structure is much better too, plus with the springed hinges they can take a little more abuse. For the price, they can't be beat."
5,"Great glasses, great price, fast shipping!!","These are some of the best avaitors around! They are the perfect size, and the spring arms are great! You cant beat 3 pairs of glasses for $10. This is the second set I have bought from these guys, and I will buy again when I need new ones!"
3,Good... but not for driving.,"I really like the way these sunglasses look, feel and block out the sun... in most circumstances. That said, when I am driving, the sun constantly reflects out of the corner of the glass right into my eye. Ive had to take them off and put on an old pair a couple times because they became unbearable. When I am sitting at the beach or walking outside these sunglasses are excellent. I guess because I am constantly moving at different angles in the car the sun hits the glasses differently. I'd recommend them if you don't plan on driving with them."
4,Best Buy Aviator,"I have to say these glasses are a best buy. It is not everyday you can find three mirrored aviators for this price. They are very light weight and fit great. They are pretty durable and the tint is a perfect shade. The time of delivery was pretty good as well. You cannot go wrong with buying these glasses. G & G I say kudos to you, I am one happy customer."
4,Great glasses for the price!,"These glasses are great for the price you pay for them. My only complaint and it is a minor one, is that the lenses are alittle to dark. I got the black mirror lenses and they are dark. It is great for driving in the sun but if you are by the pool or in the shade it can get alittle dark. Overall I am very satisfied and will order more when I lose these (I always lose my glasses)."
5,Excellent deal.,"These glasses are both attractive and effective. Well worth the money. At the price, you can afford to sit on them and so forth, which invariably happens anyway. They're also quite practical and very dark, which I didn't expect from such an inexpensive item.I'll definitly buy these again the next time I need to recreate some Sisters of Mercy music videos."
3,There okay,The lenses are smaller then normal aviators but they still look okay when I wear them and they dont feel or look cheap. Arrived fast and came neatly wrapped but if your wanting the bigger lensed style of aviators or you just have a big face dont get these.
1,"Bad - Can't see anything and ""mirror"" chips off","These are horrible. They block out way to much light, they are uncomfortable to wear, and they don't last. Only good for a joke, basically blind (inside or outside) with them on your head."
5,Great Quality,"These lenses on these glasses are pretty dark, great for driving when the sun is in your face. The frame on them feel very sturdy and springs are not too tight and not too loose, these are an excellent value for the price."
5,Awesome sunglasses and great price!,I have really enjoyed my sunglasses. Quick shipment and great price make this a must buy item. Would buy from again.
2,Cheap Sunglasses,"Cheap, yes. You get what you pay for. They look better in the picture. Thin lens, thin frame, loose plastic sides."
4,Good value.,"Ordered the three chrome/silver aviators. Shipped and delivered fast. Ordered on Wednesday and received on Saturday. Three aviators and one black cloth sunglasses holder. Not too dark for me like some people have stated. Maybe compared to reading glasses they are ""too dark."" Nothing special about them. They are aviator glasses at a good price. Probably try to sell the other two pairs to friends for a couple bucks."
4,really nice for the price,I bought 6 pairs of sunglasses and I was a little disappointed when I got them because they didn't look as the ones in the pictures. Also I was hoping for the order to come with a bag for each pair but each order comes with one bag only.
5,"Great for the Price, A Lot Like Gas Station Glasses","I go through glasses constantly because of my job, so I decided to change to super cheap glasses and just replace them rather than be constantly concerned I was going to lose them.These aren't spectacular glasses, but they are more than passable. So long as you are expecting inexpensive glasses, you won't be disappointed."
2,Hard to keep glasses adjusted,Not user friendly need to keep playing with the to keep glasses adjusted. I will never purchased this product again.
5,Love these sunglasses! They are a steal!,Very good quality for the price. Very happy I got them and I thank all the positive reviews that helped me decide to purchase them. I defenitely recommend these.
4,Great item for the price,I bought these for me and my husband and we love them. The only problem is that the ear pieces come loose but other than that they were a wonderful buy for the price.
3,pretty average glasses.,"These glasses aren't bad but they're not great either. When they are new they are nice but they scratch and bend pretty easily, but honestly for the money they are hard to beat. The pouch is very soft and protective. Overall I'd give these a 6 out of 10."
5,Great Deal!,"These glasses are a great buy. For just 20 dollars you get three pairs of quality avaitors.They dont feel cheap or flimsy as you may expect for the price. They shipped quickly, and the company has a great sense of humor."
3,ok,nice glasses but way to small the lens are little they measure 50mm and i needed 54mm way to small
3,"Good for the price, but still cheap quality-wise.","I love the look of these glasses, but after only one day of use some of the reflective coating was chipped off of one of the pairs. I haven't been mistreating them either. The metal seems kinda cheap and the hinges are pretty flimsy. Still they look great and you can't really beat the price. If I had the money though I might want to spend a bit more for a better pair."
5,Great value,These glasses were such a bargain and the quality is not bad at all. It takes some fitting to get used to but after a bit its perfect. They've been mistaken for much more expensive glasses and no one believes the price I payed for them. Great product.
1,Good looking but cheap,"They arrive in time, they look very good and the colors are great, however they were packed in a box and were placed inside little plastic bags, after 2 weeks, the black ones look awfull, they have a mirror covering on the lens that just start to peel off, and now when I wear them I look trhough a horrible stain were the mirror cover used to be, the brown ones are still on the plastic bag and they stained themselves, god knows how, and they silver ones are still ok, but I wonder how many time will they look ok... terrible purchase, I highly suggest to spend a bit more money on a quality product"
2,Cheap so what do you expect,"Just expect to get $5 sunglasses without trying them on and you'll get exactly what you expect. The frames are pretty good quality, I do like the spring action, but the lenses seem very cheap to me. I've had all kinds of sunglasses, from cheap to expensive, and never had a problem seeing through them. These are different, I feel like there is an almost constant glare that makes it difficult for me to see. I find that in driving conditions almost any other pair of sunglasses do better then these."
3,"Quantity vs, Quality","I had been looking for some highly mirrored aviator sunglasses for quite some time. None were ever reflective enough, so when I saw these, I jumped at the opportunity to buy. I was a little disappointed with the flimsy-ness of the glasses, but they look great on. They are perfect for photos or costumes, but probably wouldn't hold up with daily use."
3,Good for the Price,"The glasses look good and are cheap. But they're not the best as what they were designed for. Particularly it feels like the glasses are magnifying the rays a little more than the sun hitting my skin directly and they do not help at all with glare. They're just cheap, dark tinted glasses."
4,Great for driving,"I've had these for a couple of weeks now. They seem to be doing fine so far. The frame feels strong and sturdy and not light and cheap as I'd thought it would for the price. The glasses provide great overall protection. I typically drive in the S/SE direction in the morning so the sun is constantly on my left side / face. These Aviators are much better than my old Raybans at providing overall coverage as well as keeping the light out.I get three and typically leave one each in my two cars and there's a spare lying at home.My only feedback to the seller would be to sell assorted sets of three - so that people can pick a combination of chrome, red, gold etc. instead of having to buy three of the same type. I would have paid 1-2 dollars extra to have had that flexibility.Cheers!"
5,YES,"Bought these for the summer at the beach and they are eye catchers!! They worked well at blocking out the sun also, these are my favorite style shades anyway and I got them fast!"
2,EHHH,"ok. so i bought three cause i suspected they would brake pretty easily. when i recieved them they were probably the flimsyest sunglasses ive ever had. they look nice and block out the sun like crazy, but they brake to easily."
1,cheeeeeeaaaaap,These glasses are cheap in more ways than one. They are plastic knockoffs that i had to give away. One piece of advice: don't buy sunglasses if they come in a set of 3!!!
1,have not received,I would like to review the sunglasses but I still have not received them as of 33 days after ordering.
2,OK Glasses,"While I must admit that these sunglasses look good and are inexpensive, I don't like them and haven't been wearing them. This is because I find that they are actually too dark to see through. This is very irritating while driving because I can barely make out the dashboard, and they are bad in those situations when it's still somewhat bright outside but not overwhelmingly sunny. Also along the same lines, I kept getting headaches whenever I would wear them because the glasses let in a lot of light on the sides while letting in very little light through the lenses."
4,Great Fit!,"Fast, easy shipping. Great price too. They are really dark so careful wearing them indoors."
2,Didn't get what I ordered,"I ordered the set for Red, Color, and Mirror glasses. What I got were three (3) of the same glasses: a light-reddish color. I ordered this because I was looking for completely red aviators and this product had a good rating, a good price, and came in a set of 3 colors to pick from. I was skeptical to find red aviators to my liking, but at least this product offered a mirror lens; something I usually collect. I wanted to return these, but I'm too lazy to go through the hassle of returning something cheap and waiting in the mail"
5,Fantastic!,Shipped quickly and the product is great! I love aviators and these were great on the river! Will buy these again if I lose these guys.
4,Great sunglasses,They look great and the also give you a carrying pouch. The frames are pretty light. But don't expect a rayban quality sunglasses for this price.They are great glasses for the price.
3,Not Durable but Cheap,"After about 2 weeks the first one broke from very light use. It broke off from the hinge. I'm on my second one right now. The durability on these sunglasses are horrible. On the good side, they do look pretty good. They get the job done as I only needed temporary sunglasses. For the price, this isn't too bad of a deal."
2,Cheap,"The first time I wore a pair of them was for about 4 hours. I cleaned them with the cloth provided, nothing else. Not even water. The mirror finish rubbed right off."
4,there ok,these glass' are ok except for the sun hurting my eyes when I wear them their ok to wear and what a price!!!!!
