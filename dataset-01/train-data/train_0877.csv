4,Excellent Story,"I knew only a little about this story before reading ""Roberts Ridge."" There are (of course) contradicting accounts about what ""really happened"" on Takur Ghar, but the story this book tells from that momentous fight was very compelling in my opinion. I read the book quickly and enjoyed it throughout. There are so many people involved in this battle it does get hard to keep it all straight in a few spots. Overall, I enjoyed the book and appreciated MacPherson's writing style."
2,Book is Good Read - Caution On Ordering from Sun Media,"The book itself is a very good read on Operatation Anaconda. As a history buff I collect these type of books for modern warfare. The condition of the book was poor at best. I knew before ordering it would be a used book, but I didn't expect a used library book that is falling apart. I am not sure that all of the pages are included. Be careful when ordering a book from Sun Media."
2,"Great Story, Too Wordy","This book is about a great story that shows the bravery and sacrifice that our soldiers and special operations teams are forced to make on a daily basis. I am an Army officer and takes great pride in what these soldiers do. However, the author could have done a much better job telling such a sad, but important story. While telling the story, MacPherson goes too much into detail about every character. For example, he delves into the high school lives of many of the characters and tells things such as the sports they played and things that they did as teenagers. While this is great to know, it does not add to the book because it is mostly irrelevant, and adds tens of pages to the book.This battle is one that is overlooked on the Global War on Terror and is one that every American should be aware of. The book tells a great story, but in a verbose and lengthy way."
5,lots of action,"A great story of courage and determination under adverse conditions. Our troops not only have to fight the enemy, but also have to deal with inferior communication equipment, and the chain of command that is thousands of miles away."
5,"17 Hour Fire Fight Takur Ghar Mountain, Afghanistan",Could not put the book down. It tells of a gut retching fire fight and is a study in courage and determination.
5,That their deeds not be forgotten.,Very moving story! I am glad that Mr. MacPherson did not give up and saw this book through to its conclusion.This is a story is taken from multiple viewpoints to form a more complete understanding of what happened atop Takur Ghar. As this story unfolds you are able to see in your mind everything that happens. Also interesting is the benefits and ills of modern technology and how it affects modern warfare. A great book and a must read!!It will surely remain a lasting tribute to all those brave soldiers and airmen who lived and died through it.
2,Fair,"Just ok read. Would have liked maps, diagrams, photos. Hard to envision the battle as written. God bless our servicemen."
3,Go Army,"Anytime Army Generals command special forces, chaos, confusion, and senseless death results. Army Generals have to be the most incompetent officers in the military. Every battle in Afghanistan and Iraq which have been commanded by Army high command have been disasters. Government puppets trying to fight a political correct war. Thank God for the Marine Corp."
5,Extraordinary courage,"This book is a very detailed account of about three days on the top of a mountain. It doesn't deal with politics or the so-called ""big picture"". It's about special ops doing what special ops does: taking care of the members on the team. If you want ""perspective"", read a Rand publication. If you want to know what happened on Robert's Ridge and how heroes take care of each other, read this book."
4,Good read,Interesting book on a small action in the war in Afganistan. Brave troops can't overcome poor leadership.
2,Interesting contrast,"This is a very different story than the one told in other books, and several news sources. That in itself is a pretty dubious fact. I will leave it at that!There are three types of books coming out of the Afghanistan conflict - Army Books, CIA Books, and SEAL books (Forgive me but I have not seen or read and USMC/USAF books). All charges of bias aside, it is natural for the author to write about that which he knows - CIA guys tend to focus own universe etc. My point in all of this is: this, is undoubtably a SEAL book.If you are looking to fill in some blanks from resources available in print, or online by all means pick this up. If you are looking for a more definitive look at Anaconda - I would check out 'Not a Good Day to Die' by Sean Naylor."
1,roberts ridge,"I do not recommend this book! God bless the guys who were there, but over 300 pages dedicated to ONE firefight?? For a good book on that region try Lone Survivor!!"
2,Sloppy job on capturing the essence of the fallen soldiers,"I was very disappointed in this book. Malcolm came to our family's home to interview us to try and capture what type of man my brother was. I must say he did a very poor job. In all the personal facts written about my brother, the only thing he got correct was the fact that he carried his daughter's ponytail ties in his pocket. Even though he tape recorded the interviews and took notes, he did not come close to portraying the essence of my brother. Malcom got names, facts and timelines incorrect. With so many errors written about my brother, I can only assume he did a poor job with the other fallen soldiers as well.As for the facts about the battle, he got some of it correct but other areas he embellished or guessed.I believe there was only one person in my family who read the entire book. The book was that far off, that it was not even worth finishing."
1,dissapointed,"I just wasted my money on this. The demo was so bad in this DVD.Shotokan Techniques:Looked staged, for example doing a forward punch in front stance(Heian Shodan), the timing was not synchronized. the demonstrator landed in the stance, first settled down then delivered the punch. (I have never seen this in any shotokan school)No rythim in kata, no clear techniques, just looked like dance to me.If you want the real thing go for Kanazawa DVDs."
5,excellent recording.,"Another Naxos, excellent CD. Very fine recording with good space around the notes."
4,Easy Rider 1969 soundtrack from 2000 $7.99,I just ordered this Easy Rider soundtrack cd for $7.99 w/original cover from 2000. Can anyone tell me if the sound quality is good on this cd or not. I don't want to get ripped off.
5,blast from the past for dad,"my dad graduated in 1969 and this soundtrack i believe captures his youth, as glorified by this movie. this album has a few extra songs thrown on that are great. i still love 'pusher man' for a bluesy, druggy trip though"
3,But Where can I find the Album?,"I have been trying to find the album by the Holy Modal Rounders ""If You Want to Be a Bird"" appears on. That and the follow-up album ""The Moray Eels Eat the Holy Modal Rounders"" (Moray Eels, were 1/2 the group at the time) Sorry for using this forum for trying to find an album ....the Easy Rider Soundtrack is great."
3,Awesome... but spend the money on the Deluxe edition....,I was so excited that this album was half the price of the one i saw on iTunes.... but then i was disappointed when I only got 10 of the songs... they are GREAT songs... but now i'm either gonna download the other songs on itunes or just buy the whole deluxe album on iTunes....
3,Audophiles take note,"The sound quality isn't good. I'm listening in a professional studio, and some tracks have phonograph needle noise (dubbed from vinyl?) and the low end is severely rolled off."
5,Easy Rider Sound Track,"IT'S about time! I needed this so badly back in 79 when I first discover this movie, then I just tape the music from my TV ,not very good but OK. I would jam on my bike like I was Captain America. I search high and low for a tape or LP, no luck - so thank you for picking up this great CD."
1,Not Complete and Exploitive,"They added songs that are NOT on the soundtrack, yet left off songs that ARE on the sound track!! -E.g. Little Eva ""Let's Turkey Trot"" and Moby Grape's ""The Trip"". The Little Eva side was a particularly poignant piece given the context of the film.Plus, there were many segue-ways, edits and incidentals; some done by the Byrds and Clarence White, that are still sitting on 35mm mag rotting in a closet somewhere. Mr. Fonda, Mr. Hopper and Mr. McGuinn, puhleese do something!!And, what in the name of Sam Snead does Thunderclap Newman's ""Something In The Air"" have to do with the original Easy Rider soundtrack or the price of arse in China?Buy the old version and just add the missing songs as catch-can.Geese, what flaming imbeciles."
1,Don't buy it!,All of 10 minutes of this film had something to do with Donald Goines. The remainder was pimps and rappers with their so-calle tributes to him. It was such a waste.
5,A Good Cable is a Find,"It's rare to find solid connectors with plastic tabs that don't jiggle loose, stay depressed when you press them a few times, or, the usual, snap off--but that's what we have here. The wire is round gauge, not the sickly, oblong, flattish shape you're used to in ethernet cables. It almost feels braided, like a high-end audio interconnect. It has a nice coat too: feels good to hold, but is surprisingly flexible and doesn't get tangled in the rat's nest of wires by your modem. As you can see for yourself, it comes in a full compliment of lengths and colors. The gray is darker than it looks here, almost a charcoal. Not all versions are available on Prime, but those that aren't tend to ship from the retailers for free.Excellent value, highly recommended."
4,does the job,This product was exactly as advertised. I haven't had it long enough to find any really problems.
2,connector get's stuck in Ethernet port,"Unfortunately not as good as I hope it would be. Connector often gets stuck in the port, and with some systems(ethernet cards) just doesn't work at all(surprised? I was too...) ... i.e. doesn't go all the way into the port. I probably will have to cut the connector and attach a better one."
5,cat6 fast networking,cat6 fast networking thats all. I have all my devices wired now. I gave up on the wireless N so now i can stutter free media streaming for multiple devices at one
5,A fine quality instrument,"I've purchased many or most of the brands of Cat6 cable that Amazon sells, and I have settled on the feeling that Tripp Lite is my favorite brand of Cat5 cabling. Performance on most you buy is the same, but these things are made with the higest quality sheathing of any that I've tried. They perform as well, but are extra durable."
3,As described,This book arrived earlier than expected and was as described in the description. I would buy again from E-Books!
5,Very good Mexican suspense movies,Very good suspense movies released in the 70's. It is a classic of the Mexican TV screen from October 31st to November 2nd. All the actors are excellent in their roles.
4,Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul IV,My 16 year old Granddaughter requested this book for Christmas. She has read the previous three books and thoroughly enjoyed them.
3,book came in bad shape,"good book, haven't read it yet but pretty sure, because all chicken soup books are very touching, but this came in horrible condition! It damaged and looks bad, there's black in the binding, black mold like things gross! Its not even used either, but sure looks like it!"
4,"No matter what, you'll find a story that touches your heart","This book contains a bunch of short stories about teenagers lives. It's both inspirational and creative. It really feels personal, because it's written by people like you!I would definitely read this book, because, no matter what, you're sure to find a story that you'll love, or that has a special meaning for you."
4,chicken soup for the teenage soul,this book is about friendship and love.there are millions that are going threw the same thing as you'so you are not alone!!!
1,"Live Miles, if you can afford it!!","Sure this cd set is out of print, but the lowest asking price here is $217USDThere is not a great deal you get for the money. The 2 cd's only run for 75min total! I give this cd 1 star only due to the outrageous price, 5 stars for the music.If you have a spare $200, you are better off with the 20 cd box set ""The Complete Miles Davis at Montreux: 1973-1991"""
4,Good game,good game great way to get into the Pokemon game solely because it is the remake of the firstPokemon Fire Red Versionone
5,Who doesn't love Pokemon?,"This game is a great video game for anyone who is a Pokemon fan, or anyone who grew up watching the popular 90's show during it's first season. It's an upgraded version of the classic PokemoneRed game, graphics are great, hours of fun, and battling Gary sure is fun! So if you're a Pokemon fan or someone who loves the classic's of the series this game is for you! You'll love it and never get bored of it, just don't turn off the game while in a battle it will delete your file so you'd have to start from the very beginning. Other than that worth every penny!"
5,My kid likes it and he is happy.,"Fast delivery, no issue or concern.My kid likes it and having fun with it."
3,Got it because of fond memories,I played the original pokemon red version. I can't say I was a fan of the new stuff or the fixing of the missingno. glitch. It just didn't have the same feel. Oh well.
4,great gift for kids,I brought this game for my nephew's birthday and he loved it. Fast shipping and great customer services.
3,Disappointing...,"This game sounded fun when I first heard about it. Once I started playing it, I knew that my money had not been spent well. Fire Red is too much like the old version Red. I would not recommend either game for Pokemon starters. [...]. The graphics are much better and you can get more Pokemon (such as Jirachi or Deoxys)."
2,Better graphics,Remember the old Red Version? This is it but with better graphics. All They did was remake the very first Pokemon games. To me that is just a waste of money but my boys wanted it and so I got it. They have now beat it within a few weeks of playing because they already had beat the red blue and yellow versions of Pokemon years ago. So if you really liked thoses games and wanted to see them with better graphics get this game but if you are looking for a new Pokemon game to beat I wouldn't get this one its just a remake.
1,Useless purchase,I rated the game as a 1 due to the fact that the old battery save system is unable to store data anymore. So there is no point playing it or trying to use it to transfer Pokemon from it to other pokemon games.
1,Fraud,I have never received it and complained several times as to get the credit back.What is the problem with amazon and the hubba bubba game store.I will not recomend this site to anyone.
1,BAD,"I never got my product....... still waiting to receive it and i have been waiting for over three months now i beleive, maybe more."
5,Awesome!,"Awesome game. If you have Red Version, this is like an updated one with MUCH better graphics and gameplay. A lot is added here.But, one question: What's up with $61.49 for a new game?"
2,booklet and not the game.,I did not know it was only the booklet. Makes sense for the cheap price but still not what I wanted.Could have been my misunderstanding however it was in the same section as the games and listed as a game and not a booklet.
5,This is a Great Game,"This video game really brings back memories of when I first got into Pokemon. The only thing I don't like about this game is that you can't visit the Johto region or the Hoenn Region. The game starts pretty much like the old Red and Blue versions did... you'll go outside, try to go into the grass, when Professor Oak (remember him?) stops you and tells you to come to his laboratory, where you will get to choose your first Pokemon and battle your rival Gary (name sound famillar??) for those of you who haven't played the game before, I won't go into details with this one, you will need to find out for yourself. If you have played the old Red and Blue versions, you pretty much know the story so I won't bother you with details... all you pretty much need to know is that there are more missions to complete than there were in the regular Red and Blue versions, and the graphics are a lot better than before."
5,i am pokemon fans,"i alway, alway, alway love pokmeon gameboy .. i grew up play them alot! and that game is doing wonderful, no broken, all awsome game i love play it all long day"
3,"worked well, for an hour...","The game worked great and seemed to be running smoothly, but unfortunately the battery in the cartridge must have been very low already. It died after around 1.5 hours of play, and can't save a game anymore. Something to be weary of when purchasing used gameboy games, but the previous owner probably didn't know it was about to die, so I'll leave it at 3 stars."
2,Received the game but it won't work.,"Ordered Pokemon fire red, put it my Nintendo DS and it boots up fine. But every time I try to play the game it freezes and crashes, making the game unplayable. I've tried it with several DS's so I know it's not my game system."
5,This game rocks!,"Pokemon Fire Red is a role playing game. The goal of the game is to catch and train Pokemon. New features to this game include the Sevi Islands. The Elite Four is harder than the ones in Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire. Other than that, it is a great game. It is definitely worth to buy. The game also comes with a wireless adaptor. By using the wireless adaptor, one is able to trade, chat, and battle wirlessly. It should be noted that the wireless adaptor can be used with other games. Buy it NOW!"
4,The Game is on FIRE,Its a Pokemon game so you know what to expect...lots of fun. Can't wait to see the new versions coming out in April for DS!!!
4,Works great!,"I havent played this version of the game since it was was the original red and blue. I have the DS and i figured i'd give this a shot. when the game stop near me no longer carried Advanced games, i went to amazon. Lo and behold, a used game! perfect. Arrived fast and in working order. The memories are just flooding back.Thanks!"
4,P,"A picture of actual product should have been shown, received without the package, just in a plain envelope, some of the connections looked a little corroded, however working. Next time I will ask more questions regarding the condition of the game, before I purchase it."
1,Its okay,It is a good game but the one I bought would not hold a save. I should have bought a new one.
2,Discerning of Spirits,"THIS WAS A PHAMPLET (PAPER) NOT A BOOK AS I EXPECTED SO FOR THE PRICE I WAS DISAPPOINTED IN THE QUALITY.THANKS,BELINDA"
5,Packed With Power,"This is book is small in size and shape, but filled to the brim with wisdom, insight, and divine strategy. I used it as a supplemental textbook to teach a discernment course on a collegiate and graduate school level. The impartation received from simply reading and studying the book's content manifested immediately. Not only did it sharpen the gift of discernment given to my students, but catapulted the gift of discernment given to me into a totally different realm of the spirit."
4,good,"good, as all Francis Frangipane books are. Short to the point and informational. worth the small price to pay for it."
3,Niecey,I read this book but I wish that it would have had more to discuss and share. I love to read about spiritual things and reading it left me wanting more.
5,One of the best booklets on this subject,"This booklet was more than I expected to be in such a small package. Once I started reading, it was hard for me to put it down. It's also an excellent study aid."
2,so-so,"It's a booklet, not a book. I love other of his works, but this one just didn't get there for me. Good intro to the subject, I guess, but not enough meat for me. I'll likely read it another time later on and love it--seems to go that way."
2,book reveiw,I wasn't impressed with this book. It seemed to be written from a denominational view. It wasn't just telling what the scripture says but had too much personal opinion. I wouldn't buy from the author again.
3,Discerning of Spirits: A Short Article? A floating chapter without a book?,"I read the whole book in 30 minutes. It's like a leaflet, pamphlet, or starter reader on learning surface information about the discernment of spirits. After you read the book you will be thirsty for more information on the topic and feel like you need to read another book as a follow up. It reads like the introduction to a chapter book, and leaves you with this feeling in which you are ready to read the rest of the book but---where is it?"
3,Discerning the Spirits,"It was fast reading and understandable, but it wasn't as deep as I had hoped."
5,Great book!,"Weddings, Funerals and Rites of Passage is a great text for new and experianced clergy alike. Written with the input of several ministers in different faiths, it provides a wide set of options. The services can equally serve well as a complete service or as a guide and framework for writing your own."
4,Awesome compilation,"An exellent album compilation from one of the great 60's bands. Bend it, Hold Tight and Xanadu are classics in line with the best of Hollies, Kinks and Manfred Mann. A very good byu."
3,interseting,"I liked ""Zabadak"" when I was a kid. It was almost South African (I was also into Miriam Makeba).There are some other good tunes, but mostly forgettable stuff."
3,Reinventing History?,"The basic rules of good fiction are to take an interesting character and plop him into some action, then ask ""What if..."" and then ""And then what..."" and finally, ""So what?"" Konigsburg takes the reader into the brain of Leonardo by way of his Puck-like apprentice, but with little about Mona Lisa the painting or the enigma. Perhaps it will lead young readers to more about DaVinci. Thoughtful, entrancing, but not exciting; I wonder how it would read if Konigsburg decided to write the life and time of Donald Trump."
3,Who is the Mona Lisa????,"I wasn't very interested in this book because it is about the 19th century and Leonardo Da Vinci. It's a mystery about who the Mona Lisa really was. The mona lisa is believed to be a lot of people; Leonardo Da Vinci painted himself as a woman, The second Mrs. Giaconda, and Beatrice (a character in the book) are a few of the suggested."
3,"Not bad, but nothing great","I was surprised to find a historical fiction novel by this author, and the subject intrigued me - the relationship between Leonardo da Vinci and one of his apprentices, Salai, a thief that he takes under his wing. It's a fascinating and amusing story that attempts to answer one of the greatest historical riddles - why da Vinci painted the Mona Lisa. Konigsberg comes up with a light-hearted tale that has surprising depth, and fleshes out for young readers not just da Vinci's personality but also life in Renaissance Italy. I did find it slow going at first, but the characters captured my interest eventually when Salai develops a friendship with the duchess of Milan, and the story proceeds at a smart pace from there."
3,The Second Mrs. Gioconda,"While e.l. konigsburg certainly came up with an interesting premise, the delivery falls very flat. Readers will enjoy the mysterious aspect to it, where the inspiration for the Mona Lisa came from, but will ultimately be disappointed by the result. The writing is very dense, and while this is intended as a children's book, I find myself very doubtful that any child would want to sit through this book. The ending is just pathetic, and I found myself wondering why the book even existed, since the inspiration turned out to be just some random person off the streets. Salai's story could have been so much more interesting, and in the end, we are to believe that he just randomly ""found"" the inspiration? That's just pathetic, no other word for it. There could have been plot twists, and surprises, and eventually, the only genuine surprise was that konigsburg is a woman. Another one. Silly authors with their intials.Rating: 2.5/5"
3,Not bad,The book really was ok. There was no depth to the story and it didnt flow very well. The characters were mostly rather bland. The book also needs a lot of proof reading.
4,Flight Attendant School,See who makes it and who doesn't in the last 2 episodes of the Travel Channel reality show Flight Attendant School.
5,Dan Zanes Gets My Kid to Dance!,"As a family we have been listening to Dan Zanes since we caught some of his videos on Disney. Bottom line is that he makes great music that is not just kids music, but music the whole family can listen to. This new DVD has many different songs on it including some of the newer ones. Though I miss his band from the first DVD with Father Goose and Barbara his new band on this DVD is tight. They are all great musicians making great music for not just my kid but my whole family. We really like this DVD just like we like all of Dan's Records plus Father Gooses. Dan Zanes, Jack Johnson, Choo Choo Soul, Baby Loves Jazz....its nice to have music for kids that adults can get into. This is a great DVD for the whole family to dance to."
5,What a bargain!,"I use a LOT of paper. I bought my first case of Navigator paper here on Amazon because of the price. I was hooked. This paper is quality paper that I cannot find at a better price anywhere. The Navigator paper is a brighter white and heavier, more consistent quality than the standard store brands. Zero issues with paper jams. I considered four stars because each time some of the reams arrive with torn packaging, but for the price I just can't justify a four star rating. I throw the packaging away anyway. Great paper, delivered to my door!"
5,Listening to this music is a real joy...,"I really enjoy this CD - the wonderful craft and artistry of each song. I have shared it with friends and each of them want to get a copy- I've never even seen such a response about any other CD I own.Because listening to music can have a profound effect on our moods, I really like the serene and contented mood that I get from listening to ""The Crystal Spring,"" it's just very beautiful music."
4,Great Item,"It's a flip cover for Palm TX. It protects the Palm and looks very professional. One flaw, it is a bit thick and cause one's pocket to bulge. But over all, a very good product."
5,Great service!,Book arrived really quick and was in better shape than I expected (based on seller's comments). Very pleased. Thank you.
5,Pure genius!,"In the tradition of the Holy Fool and the Court Jester, Matt Cook writes and talks with poignancy and humor. Brilliant, thoughtful, intelligent, Cook communicates the commonfolk wisdom of our generation. The guy makes reading the World Book Encyclopedia a distillate comic monologue! The world must be infected by the good virus that is Matt's wit. His truths sneak up on you, disguised as unknowing candor. Cook needs his own nationally syndicated show! My favorite quote of Matt Cook's is, ""Time is a good thing. It keeps everything from happening all at once."" There is no part of Matt that isn't pure genius."
4,CD-RW TDK,"Reviews on this item contradict each other, so I'll tell my version. The TDK CD-RW discs came in a white box containing 10 discs, each wrapped in a separate slim jewel case. The `Compact Disc' logo, and all important `digital audio', are nowhere to be seen. Perhaps they save a royalty charge? The discs are 'music' also known as 'digital audio' and WORK FINE in our stand alone Sony W500C recorder. -by the way, one review mentioned that recording past the end of the disc will void entire recording."
5,TDK CD-RW,This item is great. TDK was my first RW disc and will continue to be so. Shipping and packaging is fantastic.
4,CD-RW TDK,"These work wonderful I bought mine Dec. 2010 now it's Aug. 2011 and i only used 5 out of 10. I'm a DJ so I use them to make practice mixes and lots of other stuff, use them everyday so 1 last about 2 months before they don't work anymore. I have a Sony RCD-W500 CD Recorder 5+1. I also used in my previous recorder it was a Philips, forget the model number but Sony is better."
1,bad quality,"On feb.27,2010 I purchased a 10 pack of the tdk music cd-rw discs.I have used these each 2-3 times,and now i am having recording problems. I did every possible fix to this problem,but i am still having problems.I have even sent an e-mail to TDK on their website-3 times,and have gotten NO response from them. So if you want to purchase these discs,do so at your own risk of just wasting your money!!"
2,cd-rw,"TDK CD-RW ARE SUPPOSE TO RECORD ON CD RECORDER, THEY DO NOT. ITEM IS LISTED AS DITIGAL AUDIO BUT DOES NOT STATE THAT ON THE CD CASE. IF YOU NEED DITIGAL AUDIO THIS IS NOT THE ITEM YOUR LOOKING FOR."
5,These work great!,"I had been hesitant to buy these after reading some of the other reviews. But these work great, so those reviews must have been referencing some other products like this. I'm a novice at burning cd's, and I was ready to be disappointed. But for the price, I figured it was a small tuition cost to pay in order to learn something. I'll be buying more of these in the future. There is still a slight amount of hiss, as if it were recorded onto a cassette tape, but those songs are probably like that as they're from discs that had themselves been copies."
4,Great warranty and function; cases a little loose,"Finally find some great MUSIC CD-RW's (my Sony CD recorder/player won't work with data discs). Lifetime guarantee on these, unlike the ones I bought from Memorex, which only have 1 YEAR. Can write on the surface with dry markers for temporary labeling; will erase easily with Magic Rub eraser. Good for testing prototype recordings without wasting CD-R's. Only drawback is record speed is 4X maximum. The only reason I didn't give a 5-star rating is the hubs in the TDK jewel cases barely hold onto the discs-if you barely drop them they will fall out of the case. My recommendation: change over the jewel cases over to ones that hold the disc inside better. Otherwise no performance issues."
1,Don't work in a Phillips CDR-200,"These don't work in a Phillips CDR-200 burner. I get the NO-OPC error message. If anyone has found ones that work in this burner, please let me know!! Having an impossible time finding ones that do."
4,AN EXCELLENT BUY!,"I have had trouble finding CDRWs for MUSIC, which I HAVE TO HAVE for my CD recorder. This is the best buy I've found & would buy more in the future. The shipping is a bit high, but it's better than another I bought & paid about the same shipping for 1 SINGLE CDRW-MUSIC."
5,Scaredy Bear for TJ Bearytales is the Best!,"As this story unfolds, TJ is a bit frightened after going to bed. Earlier in the day, he had seen a action movie with his father, about a bear and a robot. His imagination gets the best of him at night when he's alone in bed. He runs into his parents room. His father gives him a flashlight. During the course of TJ telling the story to your child, he actually turns the flashlight on and off during key points of the story. It is unbelievable. So cute-beyond words. My favorite new toy and story for my child. I'd give it 100 stars if I could!"
4,Another dose of melodic melancholy,"You like them. You're not sure why (I mean, it's not the 1980's anymore and it's not like you're a huge Smiths fan or Depeche Mode fan), but .. it's that sound - that sound of his.Yeah, Robert Smith is back. This album (like the reviews have noted) is close to ""Disintegration"" in mood. There are no uptempo pop songs on this album. The average tune is over 5 minutes long.I've always been impressed by his lyrics. I think Robert Smith (along with Dave Matthews) is one of the great romantics, up there with ""Astral Weeks"" Van Morrison and early Tom Waits. He is blessed with the same gift for atmosphere as Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, as well.If you liked ""Untitled"" and ""Pictures of You"" off of ""Disintegration"", you'll love ""Out of This World"" and ""The Loudest Sound"". Actually, so many people are saying that ""The Loudest Sound"" is his best. I disagree.. I think ""Out of This World"" is probably the best track here.Should you buy it? Definitely."
3,BloodFlower power...,"The first actual Cure album I've bought, and it is indeed a very good one. Smith's moody tunes are exceptional and in my opinion relaxing. Yes most of the songs are soothing its easy to lie back and listen to this distinctive band. Perhaps not the best album, but surely not the worst."
2,What a disappointment,"I have been a huge fan for years but this album is a disappointment. Not only do the songs all sound vaguely the same but there all just a little too dark. As usual Robert's words are eloquent but the tunes don't do them justice. Give me more of 'Trust','Letter to Elise' and 'Wish impossible things'. Good luck guys in your retirement."
3,definitely not a perfect album,"I don't understand how people can give 5 stars to this album. If you've heard older cure sound and you compare it with their newest work, you definitely cannot say that it's a brillant album. Yes, it is good, dark and cure-like, but not comparable with their best work. Where the hell has Robert's shivering voice gone..."
3,The band of very few words,This C.D. was basicly non vocal with good insterment playing so if you like rock music with very few words this C.D. would be perfect for you but if you prefer the backstreet boys and Brittany spears stay away from this album.
1,You're All In Denial!,"The good news is, the Cure has left the happy stuff behind and is back writing the sad, moody songs which they do best. The bad news is that this is a very weak collection of tracks. Although some hark back to the Disintegration/Wish era, these songs would have been B sides if released back then. Even Robert Smith seems to be admitting that ""the fire is almost out"". The songs are overwrought and lack any kind of hooks. Only hardcore Cure fans (like myself) will find this listenable. Anyone else will be bored to tears. These nine songs are the best they could come up with in five years?"
2,should we really expect more?,"The cure can overwhelm you with depression,desire and even nostalgia yet for one reason or another cant seem to conjure up an album one could consider great since the fall of the eighties. should we expect more from them ? No,i dont think we should but i do believe when you compare this album as a whole it is still far better than 95% of modern radio music thats forced down are throats as a daily routine. A purchase worth its wheight in donuts id say as a music fan,a purchase for the mere fact of adding it to the collection for a cure fan."
2,The Cure can't help it,"This albums sounds to me as The Cure trying to make another Disintegration. It's sad coming from a band with such great moments like The Head on the Door and Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me. I think the real highlights in today's Cure career are Burn (from The Crow soundtrack, and More Than This (from THE X FILES soundtrack."
2,not classic cure,"Everyone seems to have joined the party a little late..11 years. Hell, the cure have been around much longer than that children. ANd THey were truly great visionaries and unique in the late 70's early 80's...try their early stuff and then comment."
1,This is the end,"This is the greatest band of the last twenty years at its worst (which seems to be going around--Check out U2's 2000 release). I own and cherish virtually chunk of studio music the Cure has deigned to offer us, but this...this is intolerably bad, intolerably predictable. If this is indeed the last Cure effort, I can only say that the barn door was closed too late. This disc belongs where I have put it twice (thanks to my wife buying for me, too): in the cheap racks at your local trade-in store. For those new to the band, if this piques your interest (though there's no reason I would see it doing so), put your hard-earned dough down here at Amazon (a plug) and pick up, in order, Disintegration, Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me, The Head on the Door, and the tape of Standing on a Beach, which has a side full of B-sides that should have made it onto real albums. Stay away from the album that should have told me demise was imminent, Wild Mood Swings, as well as the live crap Show and Paris."
3,The Cure - Bloodflowers,"When I first heard about this album, I was quite excited, even more so when it was compared to 'Disintegration'. Now, after having bought the album and tried to listen to it more than once, I feel such a comparison is unjust. This album does not even come close the the magic conveyed in Disintegration'. My adivce for any new fans, save your money on this one and buy 'Disintegration', the last 100% excellent album The Cure put out. DISINTEGRATION RULES! (can you tell I loved 'Disintegration'? Doesn't get any better than that one kids!) :)"
1,Garage Sale material,I am not a great Cure fan but have a couple of their CDs and VHS of their early stuff. I have read all the other 128 reviews so what else can I say? First I liked Wild Mood Swings right from the opening track. I must have walked in then out of the store a hundred times over the last month or so trying to decide whether to buy Bloodflowers or not. I decided to buy the cassette and save a few bucks just in case. A good decision. Got home popped the mc in the player and about half way through the opening track thought what *hit is this. Ejected it put it back in to its box and shelved it. May try again a few months from now when I am having a garage sale and looking for stuff to pay to be taken away. Sorry Bob and the boys you've done better.
2,"Smith, lets get back to the music please","I think Wish was the last truly great Cure album where the music was complex, enchanting, hypnotising. Ever since then however, Smith seems to have gotten caught up in putting the lyrics first, and the last couple discs just come off as Robert reading with some bland accompaniment behind him.Robert, or anyone out there who can get a word back to him, PLEASE -- LETS GET BACK TO THE MUSIC. Do an instrumental or something, anything, but give the words a rest, go write a novel or something. :)"
4,Flowers in Bloom,"The Cure's latest record is a journey back to the hopeless sound of darkness and the morose. However, I don't hear the resemblence to ""Disintegration,"" as so many other reviewers do. ""Disintegration"" is an epic record saturated with atmosphere that lurks in your dreams. The use of keyboards are heavy and thick. In ""Bloodflowers,"" the songs tend to use more catchy electric and acoustic guitar riffs. Despite this, ""Bloodflowers"" stands on its own. If you like Robert Smith and The Cure, you will like this album. At least it's not ""Wild Mood Swings."""
2,Bloodflowers-- trilogy with ... and Disintegration?,"No. Give those two albums another play and skip this one.. other than possibly Watching Me Fall, it's just another reminder that even the relevant and interesting artists are no longer relevant and interesting these days. Here's hoping Robert Smith can find something productive to busy himself with, because The Cure has already done all that it needs to and is probably able to do -- see above two albums, Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me, and Staring at the Sea (the Singles)."
3,A good album,"As a Cure fan, I was waiting with anticipation for the release of 'Bloodflowers' and I must say that it was a little disappointing. I find it strange that people compare this album with 'Disintegration' and 'Pornography' saying it is the following of these fabulous records. Some songs are very good, like 'Out Of This World', 'The Last Day Of Summer', 'There Is No If...' and 'Bloodflowers', but still I felt this album wasn't as sincere as the others. It's certainly not their best and I pray that they will release a new record that will be more up to their usual standards. But I'm a very devoted Cure fan and I don't write this for dissing them. If some people fell in love with The Cure with 'Bloodflowers' then it's a great record. I guess it's just a matter of opinion, but to me it's a good record, not less not more."
5,"If this is their last, its a triumphant exit!","This has to be the best Cure CD ever! Don't get me wrong, all there CDs are excellent, but none more profound than Bloodflowers. The ethereal sound of the overlapping guitars, the poignant lyrics, and Robert Smith's haunting voice. This is definitely a timeless masterpiece!"
5,Robert Smith Is Still The Best,"Yes,Robert Smith can still write the deepest,soul searching,music for those who will take the time to open their minds and hearts to let him in.I have been a Cure fan since my college days in 1984 and I have experienced all of Robert Smith's music projects since that time.Bloodflowers is full of spine tingling guitar work that only Robert can bring to life accompanied by Simon Gallup's bass genius to create the best CD to hit the music market since the Cure's Disintegration which blessed us in 1989.Robert Smith has given us a special gift with Bloodflowers.Thomas Edison said ""Music is food for the soul"" and this is what Bloodflowers will do."
3,i did have high hopes for this.........,"i really wanted to be blown away by this as the pre-release buzz was that this was a return to the disintegration-era sound of the cure. granted, there are some excellent songs here--'watching me fall,' where the birds always sing,' '39' and especially 'bloodflowers' are some of my favorite songs by the cure. i have to say though that the other five songs on the album are quite boring--too sparse of a sound, too slow, and no real fire. luckily RS DID come back strong with 'the cure' a few years later and hopefully that winning streak will continue!"
5,Beautiful,"What I really like about this disc it is its sense of simplicity and depth: it sounds to me like some beautiful, unadorned Neil Young album, with lyrics that come from the heart and always escape easy ""poetry"". BF adds a new dimension to the Cure world: probably Robert Smith is just ageing, but in the past he never achieved this painful feeling of ""pietas"" for the destiny of man. A wise, sober album - never dark, always thoughtful. Beautiful."
3,Not bad.,"The Cure has always been an interesting band. They undoubtedly have their own sound. I'm not a devoted fan of them, but I still have a handful of their releases. I was disappointed with Wild Mood Swings--the songwriting was bland. When I heard that this new album was being released, I was cautious about getting it. Once I got Bloodflowers, I didn't care much about it at first, but after several listens, I found out that it was better than the previous album. While I don't think that Bloodflowers is a classic, it's still pretty good. It has some interesting elements throughout its duration. I don't have a favorite song though (I like different parts of each tune.). It's more in the direction of Wish than Disintegration. The musicianship, vocals, and production are all satisfying. The songwriting is okay. Bloodflowers isn't as good as Disintegration, but it's still a little better than Wild Mood Swings. Not bad."
2,"The Cure is my favorite band, but....","While Pornography stands as the Cure's greatest triumph, the other two albums in this so-called trilogy, Disintegration and now, Bloodflowers, are what I would term ""generi-mope."" Nearly every song on Bloodflowers sounds the same. And it's not a terribly interesting song, musically. Lots of acoustic guitar too high in the mix and no musical breathing space. What Bloodflowers needed was more songs like the epic ""Watching Me Fall""."
2,Good the first time you listen to it.....,"....but after that it just gets old. Sure, the instrumental work is good, and Robert Smith is a fine lyrics writer, but why listen to music if all it's going to do is depress you? The songs are WAY too long considering the fact that all that goes on in each of them is suicidal moping. I swear, if you listen to this CD all the way through you'll feel like killing yourself. If you want truly good music with a gothic edge buy Marilyn manson's Holywood album or Dusk and Her Embrace by Cradle of Filth. Sure, neither is pure Goth (Marilyn Manson has a big heavy metal influence and Cradle of Filth shows a large dab of black metal) but these two art pieces are alot more enjoyable than The Cure can ever hope to be."
4,The epitomy of true goth,"I call this Robert Smith's mid-life crisis album....which is perfect in its own way. You gotta remember...he is not 25 yrs old anymore....and throughout the course of this album he frequently reminds you of that. Just like every gothic cathedral, the colors fade over time and a new sort of beauty evolves....and that's exactly what he is doing. His new music is not what I'd call true ""Cure"" music but it has taken on a new dimension. You sense the old ""Cure"" in him somewhere yet he is alluding it somehow and distorting it into a differnet form. No matter what form Robert Smith takes I admire his artistic longings and take each album that he puts out for what it is...the next step of evolution. I still think that his music is beautiful...."
4,Cure fan here for the last 11 years,"I've been listening and collecting the cure's material for the last 11 years and find it kinda of funny that this album was so close and simular to disintegration/pornography,the album itself is pretty darn good.having close to 60 cure albums(icludes imports)I think this is pretty much the last of his days.thanks robert for the good tunes."
4,"A Somber yet elegant resignation, BLOODFLOWERS.","The composition quality within the Bloodflower album really stands out. There is alot of heart in the lyrics, honest and painfully so. The amount of guitar play is really amazing and diverse.The album clearly has a farewell tone, that pulls you in for that last dance, last tear, smile and a bow.The title song is a wonderful balance of hope and despair, trademark Cure!"
4,Looking back on this CD almost 7 years later,"This CD holds up very well over the last 7 years. I would say this is the best Cure CD since 1989's Disintegration. Maybe Someday is the best Cure single this decade. Called the 3rd part in the trilogy series that included Pornography and the aforementioned Disintegration this CD is what the Cure is to me. A slow grind mope rock band that writes deep iconoclastic lyrics, yet keeps it interesting with deep musical leanings."
5,Essential.,"Perhaps one of the less (if not the least) pop album from Mr. Smith, this one's yet remains as my personal favourite from the whole Cure's catalog.The entire album sounds like if it was expressing different nuances from the same song, almost like a winter-mood symphony.As sad as powerful, the sound and the atmosphere built on every song is simply overwhelming.Quite an essential state-of-the-art piece for any commited Cure fan, as well as for any newcomer."
4,old school sounds refreshing,An album released on a CD- it is great to hear something that was not meant to spend three summer weeks cradled between Mariah Carey and some corporate assembled vocal master race soaking up dreams of a Blockbuster Music Award...Bloodflowers is no return to classic Cure- then again no one should be that troubled for an entire life... The Cure misses the members who have left but Robert Smith's voice remains a welcome friend and a brilliant artist...
3,No innovation,"As the Cure made each successive album you could see the difference in their songmaking. Each album held its own with its creativity and instrumentation. Bloodflowers doesn't show the innovativeness of the Cure, it sounds like one long song. As for the 'trilogy' it doesn't have the fire and brimstone effect of Pornography or the damaged beauty of Disintegration. It is an ok album but it does seem like there is no cure for lack of creativity."
2,ch-ch-ch-changes,"i have loved the cure for many many years, seen them in concert many many times, yes, one of those gothic nerds that throughly enjoyed albums like faith, disintegration, pornography and even wild mood swings, but the cure is really getting too repetitive, the latest albums are all starting to run together, that is why i like wild mood swings, it was a nice change, they need to do this more often, i guess i am eluding to the fact that i am a huge david bowie fan as well and change defines his entire career"
2,Snow White... Really?,"One of the worst and most boring and disconnected movies I've ever seen. The only reason I watched the whole thing was that I kept waiting for something interesting to happen! Now, how boring is MY life? Very dull and extremely uninteresting with really poor acting. If there was a way Amazon would accept return of a REALLY bad movie, this would be one they'd get back."
1,Terrible movie,"This is a cheaply made, terrible movie full of bad acting, poor sound and picture quality, and a script that was sporadic at best. The whole Snow White name had nothing to do with the movie. I only watched the whole thing because I was entertained talking crap the whole time."
1,Waste of time.,"This has to have been the worst movie I've ever seen. The production was bad- you can see where they reused the same shots again and again. The storyline had so many holes, just horrible. Characters were cliche and the acting bad, bad, bad. I can't believe we wasted our time and money on this one!"
1,WORST MOVIE EVER MADE!!!,"Wow! This is what happens when your career is over and you're trying to make your SAG insurance. Maureen McCormick and Eric Roberts sadly fall into that group. They only appear in about 10 minutes of the film. Maureen hasn't aged well and looks closer to 65 than 55. Eric, who had a promising career has ended up at rock bottom. This movie isn't good enough to be aired on SciFi or Chiller TV. The budget for this film must have been about $5.00. There were no sets or costumes. The script was written by someone in 5th grade. Don't waste your time or money. Enjoy Maureen when she was Marcia Brady. That was the pinnacle of her career."
1,Worst movie ever,"This has to be the worst movie I have ever seen. The actors are trying to ""act"", the music is old horror movie when nothing is going on and it looks like its filmed with the cheapest camera known to man kind.The whole time they try to set you up for horror but nothing really happens. Not worth your time and definitely not worth your money."
2,"Very cheesy, bad acting and kinda lame. Marcia Brady being evil is only good thing. End is stupid. I say D+","""25 years ago a camper was killed, the person who did it disappeared never to be seen or heard from again."" A girl named Snow (not kidding) is sent to a discipline camp by her evil step mother (McCormack) because she thinks she is trying to break up her and her day (also not kidding). While there Snow begins to notice strange happenings and uncovers a hidden secret about the camp. This is a movie very much geared toward younger high school girls so that may be a reason I didn't really like it. The movie is very cheesy and low budget and you can really tell. A girl gets killed by a necklace she is wearing and there is no blood (still not kidding). The best thing I can say about this is that it is kinda cool to see Marcia Brady in a role like this. Overall, not very good but it is kinda entertaining for a while. The ending is so dumb though it makes you regret watching it. I give it a D+."
1,Terrible,"Slow, boring, wooden acting, confusing complicated laughable storyline. Its hard to believe this is a film. Its just a copy of similar films done badly. Nothing to do with Snowwhite but an attempt to draw attention to the film. Predictable from start to finish."
3,As You Desire,"I just finished reading this kindle book. Although the story line was entertaining, the spelling errors and grammatical errors (on every other page) made it very ""painful"" to read. Doesn't anyone proofread any more or do a simple spell check?"
4,Fast-paced and interesting,"I have never read this author before, but I will now. It has been a long time since I enjoyed a romance novel, they were all starting to be the same. I was tired of reading the same thing I read 7 years ago. I found this book to be thrilling, wonderful and funny. If you like to be entertained, instead of bored to tears by the usual, buy this book."
5,Oh I wish it could go on some more.,I loved this novel. It will probably go down as one of my favorites. I love the two leads in this novel. They were both so interesting and likeable. Harry is such an unconventianal hero. I loved him. I can see why Desdemona did as well. She was absolutely adorable. It was not difficult to see what inspired such love and passion in Harry. Thank you Ms. Brockway for this story. It will always live in my heart and memory.
5,A must for students of grammar,"This is a wonderful reference for both children and adults alike. In fact, I am ordering 6 copies for my classroom so that my students can have an easily understood, well written guide to use as they muddle through all of the eccentricities of English Grammar."
5,Easy Grammar for your Students,"This book is a great, simple, explanation of most of the key grammar topics that most elementary students face. It works really well with the Dailygrams series. It's easy enough to follow that you can send your students to find the information themselves."
4,I needed this book,This book it is a great help when I am not sure how to guide my kid...very good just followed the rules in this book.
3,Scholastic Guide: Checking Your Grammar: Scholastic Guides Marvin Terban,This item is more helpful to a student taking a class in English and needing a little help. It is not as detailed as other books however.
2,torn and damage in the mail,the book is great. It however showed up torn and damaged via the mail so it was not properly packed from its origin.
2,A great premise is wasted,"The power of a man's grief and hallucinations propel him back in time so he might stop his sister's brutal murder from happening. However evil forces, not to mention time itself, are constantly battling against him. Will he save his sister and himself, or will he destroy it all in the hellish flames of a time paradox?Author Richard Lee Byers has concocted a great Twilight Zone story, but he refuses to explore the characters and situations in any real depth. The story unfolds at a brisk clip, rushing from moment to moment and never slowing to build any real sense of mystery or threat. Too bad, this book could have been something. As it is now though it is nothing but one hastily presented contrived cliffhanger after another."
5,Lest We Forget,"The book is well written and an accurate portrayal of the helicopter war. It is a good read and should be of interest to veterans, military and history buffs, researchers as well as anyone else interested in the Vietnam War. I was a helicopter crewchief and flew with Bill Meacham in Vietnam."
5,The best Buy EVER!!!,"This chair is so cute and so functional I purchased it because it was stationary and didn't rock and I is so perfect our little Girl loves it and I would buy it again!!!!It is so sturdy one of our adult friends also sat in and I was shocked it didn't even budge and I was very nervious.I would recomend it to all of my friends it's cute, safe and a great buy!!!! We got it when our daughter was 12 mos and she is now 18 and she loves it!!! I'm sure it will fit her until she is about 3 years of age. BUY IT!!!!"
3,Not sturdy,A child can easily tip over in the chair if it is not positioned against a wall or something solid.
4,My Grandaughter loves this chair!,I bought this chair for my grandaughter to sit in our den with her grandfather - now they're like two peas in a pod - he has his easy chair and she has her sunshine chair - just fit for a little princess!
1,What a disaster.,"I ordered this because of the positive reviews. Nowhere does it indicate that it doesn't work on an Apple. There is some vague notation about what to do if you use an Apple. I spent about an hour trying to do that. Then I called someone who is expert in computers to help me. He gave up after 30 minutes. I work on the computer all day every day. In my opinion, this is a piece of junk."
4,Hard to define,"This is a very interesting CD. Not really rock, not really country. The ballads are very moving. The music is excellent. My only complaint is that the bass is overemphasized. Those with enormous subwoofers in their cars will love it as they go deaf before 30!"
5,"Petroglyph, a must read","I recently read Don Alloway's new book ""Petroglyph"" and was very impressed.Mr Alloway's ability to bridge the past with the present is very dynamic.I was especially interested in the historical aspect, learning how the conquistidors were able to destroy a truly beautiful and civilized people. Mr. Alloway's description of the Inca ruins made me want to get on a plane and visit this country, which most Americans know little about.The romantic story line was very today, as more of us feel our mid life crisis. The ending had a touch of old fashioned romanticism, something badly missing today.I highly recommend Petroglyph to your readers."
4,First novel,"I found this first novel by Don Alloway to be extremely believable and insightful. Not only are we reading a ""story"", but learning Peruvian history and culture. I thoroughly enjoyed Mr. Alloway's first novel-highly recommend it-and look forward to more."
5,Decent Recording of Schubert Octets,"Franz Schubert penned the D.803 Octet in F Major in 1824, modelling it after the immensely popular Septet, Op.20 of Beethoven. It has the same number of movements (six). Schubert's Octet adds a second violin as the eighth instrument. This Naxos recording is a decent one, played by the Schubert Ensemble of Budapest. It is a longer work than Beethoven's, stretching to over 57 minutes. But Schubert has many entertaining ideas woven in that make this Octet enjoyable to listen to. Recommended."
2,Backwards Life Of Romeo,Disappointing effort from a group who was innovative on their first album. This collection sounds like bad pop music from a start-up group and not the folks who did Aftermath. Why hasn't the first album been released in CD format yet?
4,Not very friendly to Linux,"Although this card works very well with Windows products, getting it to work with Linux is not for the beginning or even intermediate user. It is a complicated and tricky process."
2,Read the jacket and the last chapter,"This would have been such a great book. But the author's presentation was terrible. I could have found a bunch of information and pasted it into a book. Don't get me wrong, the information could have been very interesting, but wow, it was just a bunch of cut and paste from different sources. The synopsis of the book on the jacket was better written than the actual book itself. The last chapter was pretty good - there was not a ton of cut-and-paste and the author actually WROTE something. If this is how his books are, I will NOT be reading any of his others."
2,Repetitious,"This entire book could be rewriten in only 75 pages. While the author has some wonderful anecdotal stories coming from one section of the front or another each page seems to be repetitious of the last. You will learn and hear of story upon story of soldiers singing Christmas carols and putting up Christmas trees on top of their trenches.The author tempts you into this book by ascerting the question of ""what would have happened had the soldiers not resumed fighting after the truce."" This idea is not thoroughly or adequately explored and I was left unsatisfied. The question is never fully addressed.If this is a topic which interests you, by all means read this book. Just skip the 100 extra pages in the middle."
4,Great Story,Let me open by saying that the book is not all that well written. However the story is amazing. I am shocked that I have never really heard about this prior to reading this book. Everyone should read this book especially those who think peace will never happen. Very good lesson.
2,A good story that could be told in 4 pages,"This is one of the most poorly written books I have read in years. You either have to know German or the entire geography of Europe to understand what Weintraub is taking about. No German or French words (sometimes whole paragraphs) are explained in english. This book is long-winded, redundant and out of order, it may be 50 pages before Weitraub gets back to something he was in the middle of writing about. Steer clear and read the synopsis on the back cover of this one. Well-researched for the families of those who fought in that batlle, but not for me."
3,"Interesting topic, flawed presentation","I must agree with other reviewers who commented that the rather extensive re-telling of fictional accounts of the truce do little to portray the events as they actually happened. Perhaps the author borrowed from the fictional accounts because he himself was not able to adequately describe the events of the Christmas truce from an ordinary soldier's point of view? I wonder if a lack of primary source material could have caused the author to rely significantly on fictional accounts?While I find the topic quite fascinating, unfortunately the author's disjointed presentation of the subject matter did little to provide the reader with comprehensive insight into the historical event."
3,Lots of information with an OK story.,My assumption is the author gathered and organized information carefully and then put it into book form using a story to string the facts together. I'm glad I read it but it was just barely ready for story form.
2,Put It Down After Page Thirty,"The title of this review says it all. At page thirty you have the entire story. At page 38, I recall wondering what the remainder of the book was about. The author had already described the Christmas truce at a few locations on the battle line and added that headquarters was not in favor of the temporary peace. The remainder of the book is devoted to giving more and more examples of the same. A nice magazine article, as a book it became tedious."
1,Get it from the Library or borrow from a friend,"What is happening to Non fiction .... Time and time again I find myself buying and then reading a great story for 30-40 pages then its downhill fast .. Having read many of the classics associated with WWI ,I was looking forward to an extra dimention to an extraordinary event . The book delivers early on then becomes a series of random references and is repetitive . I dont blame the author , the editors and publishers must accept responsibility for this occurring .Get it from the Library or borrow from a friend"
2,Short and repetitious...,"Another promising book that is marred by repetition of the facts (the same story is told over and over again by the German, British, French and Belgian troops). It seems that I've been running across this far too much lately in these short historical books, and it's disappointing. I've read some of Weintraub's longer works, and they are very good, but this time, he really dropped the ball."
2,"Great story, but book is hard to follow","This is a great story for the holiday season and is a great anomaly in what was a horrible war of attrition. However, the book is more of a collection of thoughts rather than an oral history or an actual story. At times I couldn't tell which side I was reading about unless the names were totally obvious. Also it may be tougher to understand if you don't know the geography or the history of the WWI era and how it came to pass."
2,silent night,"There is a great story here. Unfortunately, it is not in this book. It feels like the author did a huge amount of research, and then just put it in order and published it. There is little ""story"". I was hoping it would be a good read for my son who is studying WW1, but it just doesn't read well."
5,Well played Marches,I am a big fan of Naxos collections and have almost never been dissappointed. These marches from various sources including opeas and ballets are very well played by the Slovak Philharminic. A few of the marches were so impressive that I plan to look for more works by the composers especially the Caucasian sketces by Ippolitanov and Hansen's Valdres march and Newman's film music. This is not taxing music but well worth the price.Please excusee typos I have a neurologic disease.
2,"Protein is good, flavor is bad bad bad.","I didn't expect this cereal to taste very good, so I wasn't surprised when it didn't. If you want that extra kick of protein, I suggest mixing it half and half with a better tasting cereal. The protein did leave me feeling more full throughout the morning, but I took no pleasure in eating it. To make matters worse, the flakes are very thick and large, which makes them even harder to swallow. If you're going to make a bad tasting flake cereal, please have the courtesy to make the flakes smaller so they don't scrape my throat while I'm gagging on them. For some people, the ends justify the means. If you are one of these people, go ahead and buy it. I like a little more flavor in the morning, so I don't think I'll be buying it again."
1,nasty,"I am forcing myself to eat it. It is like cardboard with cinnamon graham cracker flavoring. If you want high protein, save your milk and use it for a whey protein shake."
4,Excellent for low carbbing,I'd have to agree with the others. When I first bought it my expectations were low because other brands of low carb cereal (like Hi-Lo) were bland and did taste like cardboard. I've been using it for about 4 months and have not yet gotten tired of it. I liked it so much I tried out Amazon's subscription for a delivery every two months.
1,A Great Disappointment,"Unfortunately, this cereal is almost tasteless and what's even worse is that it gets soggy far too quickly. Now I'm stuck with over 3 and 1/2 boxes of cereal that I just have no desire to eat. Yuck! Big waste of money."
3,good while it lasted,"I have been using this flash drive for about a year now, and I use it A LOT to transfer and backup files, on a daily basis. Yes, I have lost all files a couple of times and had to reformat the drive. But that happens so rarely compared to how often it does work that I think it's almost insignificant. However, after a year of extensive use the USB connectors have worn out (I guess), and it takes some wiggling around for it to be recognized by the computer.Another note: I really like the small size of it, and it's pretty sturdy. I also have a TwinMOS Mobile Disk III (the cap and the lock switch broke in no time) and one from ScanDisc (the cracking sound it makes when you push out the USB connector is annoying), but the Centon is simply much sleeker and less annyoing."
1,Can I go lower than zero?,"I got it cheap during Black Friday, to replace my 8GB stick and this instantly made me regret it. Not only is it slow to write to, but it halts the entire system when I use it. It's not useful in any regard. Avoid at all costs."
1,Give it a Zero,"Used only a couple times over a few months, then failed. First flash drive I've ever had that failed. Don't waste your money on this drive.Update: Aug 2011, I have a tech friend that was able to crack the failure on the drive and then reformat it for me. Thought I was good to go with the drive. Unfortunately, after a few uses, the drive locked up again and will not work. Maybe I just got a bad drive, but it seems that this failure is a common theme with this drive/brand. I suggest you spend your money on a different brand."
1,Terrible flash drive,Purchased this flash drive at a military PX overseas since options are limited. I utilized this drive three times before it stopped working and my computer could not recognize it. What a waste of money. Avoid at all costs.
5,Handy and a Good Price,This 2gb flashdrive is a good deal for the price. It's not so small it gets lost in your purse or briefcase.
3,Unreliable,"I found it to be completely unreliable.On two occasions I had it totally scramble my data, I was unable to recover it using any of the normal tools, forcing me to reformat. On another occasion, it corrupted itself such that the OS wanted to force a reformat... again unrecoverable. Finally it just died completely with a slow blink on the LED indicator and I wasn't even able to get the OS to recognize the device at all.No response from Centon, despite several attempts.UPDATE: They did finally respond and replaced the drive. So far so good."
1,"SLOW, SLOW, SLOW, Too FREAKING SLOW","Worst USB Drive ever, it seems that it is built with the cheapest material. Buy Another Brand. It will definitely save you a lot of time."
1,Very unreliable drive,"This is the worst product I have ever purchased. I tried to copy 4GB file, it failed and from that point the drive is not loaded or recognized in any of the PCs. It is useless even for $5"
2,Great if you don't need to remove it...Ever!,When i first got this drive I was really happy about using it. I actually used it as an extended storage unit for my xbox for 2 years. Now after removing it and reformatting it to mac os journaled it has trouble being plugged into computers. If i plug it in a usb slot it will register and then eject itself if tampered with or even if not tampered with. I'm frustrated and will most likely throw it away :( Such a waste. It was amazingly fast when it worked though!
1,Short Life span,I bought the 8gb 2 weeks ago. At first I was impressed with the quick transfer rate of 7.2mbs. Now it doesn't respond when I connect it to my computer. Read the reviews these folks are not steering you wrong.Do not buy this junk.
1,IS A HORRIBLE PRODUCT,Bought this brand new for a transfer of Xbox games. Transfered about half of the games and decided it didnt want to be recognized. only had it for 1 day. 1 Day. Horrible Produt. DO NOT BUY...YOU WILL LOSE ALL YOUR INFORMATION.
1,Died after a month and I'm out $45,"Worked great for 30 days. Then inexplicably failed, on all my machines. This product should be pulled from shelves. What a waste of money."
2,read speed at 4.3MB/s and write at 17.3MB/s,"don't buy and if you bought and have not open, return it even if you loose 15% restocking fee.write at 4.3MB/srewrite the movie back to my desk top at 17.3MB/s ==> effectively the read speed.This is tooo slow of a write speed for such a big drive!!! at 32gb."
1,Discarded in the trash can,"I purchased these to be a temp transfer media from camera system to photo editing station. After losing one set of photos, I did a LONG disk check and then a format with verify bad sectors. All 3 fail at some point. The lost files folder has thousands of tiny chunks of files in it after a few uses.Completely a waste of time and money.Don't bother with them at all."
1,Bad product with no good waste of money,"Centon DataStick Pro 16 GB USB 2.0 Flash Drive DSP16GB-009 this type of device is useless also claims a free operating system error and does not work a waste of money and time, I'm from Venezuela's best to buy good brands and I do not recommend this product and return it or how bad they sell bad products quality.very very bad product."
1,Junk.,"Tried to use it on my xbox 630. It reported the data loss is too high and won't use it. Tried to do a console system upgrade, downloading files to the Centon, and nearly bricked the console. Don't let this Centon POS anywhere near an xbox 360. Maybe it will work better on a PC, but why take the risk? I might RMA it but from reading these reviews the problems appears to be terminal. Drop it in the trash now and be thankful you didn't lose any data later."
1,Failed almost immediately,This was a gift. First attempt to copy files it spontaneously ejected and initially was no longer recognized. Several attempts to recover it and it finally remounted. Copied a single file - successful. Second file - success. Third file - crashed and ejected. Then no longer recognized. Very poor product.
1,1/2 star,Seriously even my 6 years old usb key is faster. It took me about 10 minutes to transfer 40 songs.DON'T BUY THIS THING!
2,It was perfect for about a year,"for the first year it worked great, I formatted it into an NTFS format since it came in FAT32. It worked in regular usb2 speed, nothing over the top. and after about a year it started giving me an unreadable error, so each time I wanted to use it it asked me format the flash drive, which I kept doing over and over again in hope to see a change, but nothing happened, it kept giving me the same problem. and when it didnt, It was giving me the problem when I was trying to plug the flash drive on a different computer, so it was either only recognized on my PC, and not working on others, or unreadable on any PC at all (including mine). I've decided to stop using it, its a shame, I bought this when it was around $23.99 (16GB). Wont recommend it, very untrustworthy, luckily I backed up the data I had before the ""unreadable error"" began."
1,useless write protected,"3 months later, its write protected, cant format, tried killdisk, linux, regedit, its readonly now will not buy a centon product again."
1,Really bad product,"I am a computer pro, I own maybe a dozen USB flash drives. I have had occasional problems with drives, but never had a piece of junk like the Centon. It accepted a large file, but I was unable to read it. I tried to format the thing - no luck. I contacted what Centon laughingly calls their support service and just ran into road blocks. I know how to care for USB flash memory, so I know it was not my fault. This company makes cheap junk, avoid them at all costs!"
1,Please read this if you're an Xbox 360 user,"This drive is terribly unreliable. It failed the initial test to begin using it as Xbox 360 storage (which should have been my first clue) but eventually was accepted by the Xbox and I started six hours worth of Battlefield DLC downloading. Halfway through, the USB drive lost data and had to be reinitialized by the Xbox (which should have been my second clue) so I started the downloads again. Worked okay, then after the console shut down and started back up the USB drive had to be reinitialized by the Xbox. Now this drive is in the trash, where it belongs. Too bad, it's a nice looking USB drive and the price was great for the capacity -- but it's just no good."
2,Poor design flaw,"The drawback of my datastick thumb drive device is the cap will not stay intact on the tip. Therefore, the unit is more readily at risk for moisture or other forms of breakage. I use an alligator clip to keep mine in one piece."
1,"Does Not Work!: ""The File or Directory is Corrupted and Unreadable""","After one use, the 8Gb USB Centon Datastick Pro was unusable. Under properties, Used space = 0 bytes and Free space = 0 bytes."
2,Failed after 4 months. Case quality poor.,"I did not purchase from Amazon. Bought it local. After a couple of inserts/removals, the metal casing pulled off, leaving the plug and memory chip plugged into the computer. Poor QA. A tiny dab of super glue solved that issue. Worked fine for a few months of moderate use (moving files between home & work 2-3 times a week). This weekend it started failing. It will mount then drop as soon as I try to copy a file on or off. I would pass on this brand/line. I have had better luck with Kingston."
1,Drive Failed,"I ordered this product and transfered about 16 GB of data to it. I used it for awhile; but after about a month, it failed to be recognized as a known USB device. I couldn't even format it. It simply couldn't be recognized as a flash drive. Needless to say, all the new data I stored on it during the month I used it was lost."
1,Waste of time and money,"This product simply does not work. I can transfer about 6 gigs of data and then I get a drive error (EVERY TIME). Reformatting does not correct the problems. And you can forget about help from customer service from Centon. After checking the internet reviews elsewhere, this appears to be the norm for this product. I am greatly disappointed."
1,For half the price it works half the time,"I bought this because it was a great price for the amount of drive space. I loaded it with, among other things, financial files such as Quicken backup files and a spreadsheet of credit card payments. It worked fine for a few weeks. Then last week in the middle of reconciling my Quicken file I got an error message that the drive could not be read. It took several minutes to recover the info. Today it happened again with a spreadsheet. If you want to save a few bucks in the short term, buy one of these. But it looks like I'll be shopping for another flash drive."
1,Centon DataStick Pro by Centon (64gb),Very slow access - can not reorg or compress disk.Took 2 hours to load 4 files totaling 2gb.Can't call Centon - gotta email them. They'll send you another .....
1,Junk,"I've had many flash drives, and whatever the brand they always did what was expected. Not this piece of junk. After only a couple of days working with it, it suddenly couldn't be read, and needed to be reformatted.Don't be suckered into the low price, you'll only get junk."
2,yet another politcally correct tall tale,"What happened to just looking at history for what it was? This book ends with Paul feeling sorry for cutting down all those trees and going off to plant new ones. How very PC. While now we know that maybe it wasn't such a great idea to clear cut and rape the land, at the time these legends emerged it was seen as a sign of progress. I would have much preferred simply enjoying the rough and ready, log chopping, flannel covered, pancake eating fun. That era is gone forever, and books like this detract from it rather than pay tribute to the hard work and ingenuity required to build our nation. Add an addendum if you must at the end of story, explaining how and when the logging was done and how we now do things differently, but don't change the original story.I also felt the text itself was somewhat patronizing with its contrived language and overuse of hyperbole."
2,Astronauts at space,A few men wanted to go to the moon and looking for action and adventure.Astronauts shoud read this book because it talks about them.Because people whowant be a astronauts is able to learn form this.
1,I would rate it ZERO but I couldn't,"Ha Ha Ha, this band is NOT heavy. I repeat. Not HEAVY. This C.D should be ignored or sent in crates to the moon. Pretenders, Fake, Trendy, Weak, Boring. Just a few words that came to my mind when I heard this."
4,Toddler toy,"This ride on toy is extremely sturdy, small enough to be indoors, and can be used for longer than just a few months."
2,No steering makes it frustrating for baby,"This is a well-made toy--sturdy, stable, nice design EXCEPT there's no steering--It just goes straight unless baby stands up and picks it up to make a turn.My 16 month old son found this more frustrating than fun, so I am returning it."
3,"""The Shrink Is In"" (2001)","This is a silly and sometimes funny film...I like Courtney Cox in ""Scream"" (1996) than here but who's reading this anyways...(...)end"
4,The Shrink is In,"This is a cute movie that I enjoyed watching. As a David James Elliott fan, I particularly liked his role in this."
4,Cute comedy,"I thought it was cute and it held my attention. Courteney is very good with the goofy, ""FRIENDS"" type of comedy. It was kind of odd watching it knowing what's going on with Cox and Arquette at this time. David seemed to be playing himself (though I don't know him personally), a cute goof with a heart of gold. I'm not sure why some people gave this 1 star? I've seen MUCH worse movies than this! They must have incredibly high standards. I was entertained and laughed out loud quite a few times."
1,not as advertised,"the earrings were not same size--one end of the left one was longer than the right one. they also were unevenly twisted. the wire is so soft that I could shape the earrings myself just with my fingers. The balls at the end look much smaller compared to the spiral wire piece. Bottom line, no matter how I put them, they stick out to different sides. I definitely think that I overpaid big time for them. If I were to see them in the shop I would have passed on them."
2,"Good idea in concept, bad in execution","I ordered these along with ""Curley Cue Twisted Spiral Sterling Silver Hook Earrings"" from Silver Insanity. I am not sure if they are the ones who manufacture these or if they buy them from somewhere else for resale, but they are VERY flimsy and were not symmetrical at all. When I started to bend them to symmetry, it was evident that any new bend was going to be irreversible and permanently kink the metal. I thought they looked very cool with a hint of sci-fi, but they looked awkward when I tried them on. It reminded me of misshapen paperclips with a silver BB glued at the end. I ended up returning them. They are an interesting pair of earrings, but be prepared to get exactly what you see in the picture -- they don't line up. That's only noticeable as the wearer; other people who see you wearing them will most compliment them. There were no problems at all in getting my refund."
3,"Pretty, but a little off","These are very pretty and worth the price, but one was significantly longer than the other--more wire and an uneven attempt at shaping, so one was longer than the other when worn. I rebent the longer one and was fairly successful--the wire is sturdy enough that the original bend spot still shows, but it's behind the ear. They're also larger than I thought they would be, but they seem to be overall well made and attractive."
3,unusual but too long!,"thought these were very unusual so i bought them .when they came i was surprised at how long they were. i kept them because i do like different things, but would have been nice to know how long they were."
2,Author losing her focus.,"As a lover of medieval mystries, I have enjoyed Alys Clare's previous novels, but am somewhat disappointed in this one. In it, she seems to be veering toward the ""torn bodice"" romance genre, concentrating less on the medieval aspects of the time and the development of a good mystery. Let's hope that the next book in the series has more resemblance to the writing of Ellis Peters and less to Barbara Cartland."
2,Disappointing,"I have loved all seven Alys Clare books I have read so far, but this one was tedious. I had little or no interest in the way the story was written, and (having just started Heart of Ice and feeling the same) am beginning to think I need a break from her writing.It isn't that the previous life of Abbess Helewise is boring - I just don't feel that this was the correct platform for it, just as I don't think the next I'm struggling with is the correct platform for Joanna's story."
4,I saw the solution coming very early on,"This story was good, but I spotted the key to the mystery, or one of the mysteries, very early on, and that's extremely unusual for me. I usually never figure mysteries out until the last page. I don't want to give too much away, but it involves a desk, or rather a table..."
4,Las Fieras Del Rock Pesado En Espanol,"Rata Blanca es una de las mejores bandas de rock pesado que yo e escuchado en toda mi vida, sin duda alguna es la mejor en espanol. Estos locos son como el Boca Jrs del rock pesado (se la llevan de lejos)y es una lastima que sea muy dificil conseguir el primer CD de ellos, si se quiere conocer a R.T. hay que escucharlos desde el comienso y con el petiso que era una maquina cantando. (como fanatico desde que estos locos emerguieron, les recomiendo conseguir todos los CD's no se van a arrepentir)"
5,AUTHORS CARD GAME,"Our parents bought this card game for us when we were youngsters. I am now 53 years old and a grandmother. I am so glad that we were ""poor"" back then and had to stay home and play this game and read books. This game is a great learning tool, it is played basically like ""fish"", but you start memorizing the classics and their author. Everyone should buy and play this game with their children."
2,Original authors,"The cards are authentic but too small to hold and play. I wish they were larger, to see and to hold."
5,Fast READ Good information,This is a great book for those who deal with deliverance. Very fast read but very to the point.Great book in super shape. Seller was super to deal with. Prompt shipping. Thanks Vickie
2,A Pamphlet not worth more than $3 including shipping.,"The problem with online purchases is shipping, which in my case, was more than the cost of the product. Look up a discerning this spirit video on youtube, and purchase Paul Jackson's book and you will be set.This is basically a pamphlet. Hope this helps!"
3,The Jezebel Spirit (Discernment Series),"This book was informative, however, there was not enough information or bible references on the topic. Although you can understand clearly what the author is saying, there needs to be more information included."
5,Distinct echoes of Brokeback Mountain,"I live in rural Montana and one night came home to hear the music from this album being played on National Public Radio's 'Ambient Music' on a Saturday evening. I didn't know who wrote the music, but I knew I immediately LOVED these selections of solo guitar I was hearing. They sounded (to me) almost exactly like a second album of Gustavo Santaolalla's music to his score to 'Brokeback Mountain'; and he won an Oscar for that. I heard the composers name at the end of selections and ordered it from Amazon. When I received the cd of 'Slider' and played it I was immediately drawn in by the compositions. The warm and enveloping sounds of Bruce Kaphan's pedal steel guitar are amazingly luxuriating. This cd is now one of my most played albums; one I cannot be too far away from."
5,Great Ethereal Guitar,"Very beautiful ethereal slide guitar music. It has that dreamy western feel to it, and is very well done. Similar to Ry Cooder's Paris, Texas soundtrack, which I also recommend."
3,Ahhh...HELLO?!?!?,"Yes...this is very enjoyable material!BUT--with this and Jeff Pearce and others...it's as if NONE of you have ever heard Pink Floyd's DARK SIDE OF THE MOON!! It seems as if everyone is ""astounded"" that there is a use for the pedal steel ""other than country or perhaps soundtracks"" out there! Has David Gilmore's masterful use and playing of it on that and other Pink Floyd work been forgotten THAT easily?!? YES...it wasn't the ""primary"" instument, but it's inclusion and useage and tone individualized and created with and for it are extraordinary and ground-breaking!Wake up and smell the coffee brewing...oh ambient fanciers! :-)"
4,Good player,"The Creative Zen Nano Plus is a great little player. I have not had time to use all of the features yet. I love the color and that was a deciding factor. The only thing that I did not like were the ear buds because they are too large for my ears, fall out and hurt after they have been in for a while."
1,The worst piece of junk on the planet!,"Believe every bad thing you have ever heard about this piece of junk. I could not get it to download songs, becasue it never stayed powered on!. Amazon sent me a new one, and that one did not work either! I know what I was doing was right, because my husband got a black one, and it worked fine. JUNK JUNK JUNK!!!Loved the pink color, so I got a hot-pink 256mb memorex one at Target, and it works beautifully!"
1,the color is totally different than it shown on-line,"I ordered this mp3 because of the color, well the functions are good, but I like this cotton candy pink color, so I ordered it, but when i received the package, the color is totally not what i expected, that's why i'm returning this one. (i'll post the actual color later on.)"
5,Love Creative Labs,"I have a Zen Nano, soon to upgrade to a Zen Nano Plus. The Zen Nano is so easy to use, has great sound, easy instructions. I can't wait to get the Plus!Stay away from iPova from iDaptek! Its horrible! I replaced mine with the Zen Nano and have been happy with my choice ever since!"
3,Nice little MP3 player but...,"I like it, I just wish the display was bigger and that some of the options were easier to use. The folders function is kind of confusing, skipping folders is difficult and the manuals (both on line and the paper one) don't give much information. If I had it to do over, I would probably buy a SanDisk- my son has one and his display is much bigger (though the mp3 player is about the same size) and his options are much easier to use.BUT I do have to say my batteries last longer on the Creative MP3 player than his do on the SanDisk."
5,Perfect sized MP3 PLAYER.,I just recieved my Nano Plus and am very happy with it so far. The only disappointment is that the colour of the Nano showed above is not the same colour when it arrives. I would describe it as being more of a Hot Pink . Although listed as an accessory included there is no neck strap that comes with it but you do recieve a sports band and clip cover. Overall for the price it's a good buy!!!!
3,First was a dud but got better,"The first one I got was a dud and I had to spend many hours with customer service but they finally had me send it back and gave me a new one. It's not easy to read the song titles and you can't scroll through to pick what you want but for the price, it's ok."
5,This is the best mp3 on the market,"i got this mp3 player on my birthday and was a little dissapointed because it wasnt and ipod, well was i WRONG! this player is very small easy to fit into any pocket. the sound is utterly amazing. my bro has an ipod and it is nice and all but it is bulky compared to this. i listen to this before i go to bed and it puts me to sleep great. i think if your wanting a radio, voice recorder, great sound and many other things, no doubt this is for you!"
4,Great for Audio Book downloads,"I wanted to end the back breaking habit of carrying several audio books from the local library to work. I went to my libray website and found out that this little MP3 Player gives a lot for the buck. It has an FM radio with presets, it has a microphone, and for those who enjoy audio books it is the only player that starts right from where you left, regardless if it is in the middle of a sentence when you turn the Nano off. It holds quite a few books for only having 1GB. I have just purchased the 30 GB Creative Zen Vision and will continue to use the Nano for my audio books. I just found out the 30 GB doesn't have the start-stop feature mentioned above. I highly recommend this item for book lovers and patrons of the library. Downloads and check out is much nicer when you don't have to pay the fines. The quality is perfect. Overall this item is a must buy!"
5,Best Bang for your buck!,"This is an awesome MP3 player. Came with earphones, arm band (perfect for the workouts in a dark gray color), rubber whitish clear clip case, audio connector, USB, battery and software CD.Great for working out. Easy to learn! Drag and drop from Explorer to load MP3s. Pink is a hot pink more than the color shown here.I did lots of research before choosing an MP3 player and my friend who has the Scandisk 1G is jealous. Great buy and the delivery came to me in 2 days even though it said 7 days shipping!"
2,"Good overview, but not exhaustive.","As a developer looking for a more detailed reference/guide to technical usage and programming practices, this book falls short. My focus was log4j, and I found that most of the information is freely available from apache. No real value was added here. I expected at least an in depth compare-contrast between log4j and jdk logging, but this section was very terse. What would be a nice add would be a technical reference that would be one stop shop for syntax. The book didn't even provide a PatternLayout key of codes for logging items, that would be useful.What we really need is a practical bridge between javadocs and this book, which is a high level academic overview.I should have just gotten ""The complete log4j manual"", but I thought this might have been more extensive. I was wrong."
4,Good book on Logging,This book does an excellent job to readers like me at intermediate level of programming. Step by step guide on both the logging APIS was good although I settled for Log4j finally. I was a bit surprised to see this book got a one star review from someone. This book certainly does better than that. Ihave not read the complete log4j manual (it is out of stock mostly) but apart from that I could not find any other material which does a better job!! My thanks to the author.The only reason it is a 4 star to me is that there can be more on practical application of logging such as in EJB and all.
1,Ripped Off,"The product might work; however, the only reason I bought these towelettes over others was that they advertised 500/box. NOT SO. I did a quick count, approximately 100 per box. For the price, it was not worth returning.Uvex S468 Clear Towelettes, 500/box"
2,Not Wet Enough,Found that some of the towelettes were dried out and those that were not they were not wet enough. Would not recommend them.
4,Will buy again,"The fit is GREAT. The quality could be better, but at that price you can buy a new pair every month."
1,Dont waste $$$,"4 out of 4 dogs would not eat...Tried mixing with beneful, gravetrain, bits n kibble..wasted money and Food.. have almost full gallon left...thought about using for fertilizer for yard but am afraid may kill the grass."
5,Worked out ok - this time,I got burned on a bad bottle of nupro and now buy it from the maker website. It works great for my large lab chow and she profits by it immensely but I cannot trust getting it from anyone but Nupro themselves. Cant take the chance anymore.
2,Dog hates it!,I have no idea if this product works. My dog hates it and would NOT eat it in any form!
1,Description and photo inaccuate,This is not at all the size it appears to be in the photograph. It is a behemoth and would take up half of a room.The seller refuses to take return.
5,Great service!,Delivered timely and was very well-packaged to avoid breakage. Would definitely do business again with this seller.
3,More citrus than expected,"I love Pink Sugar by Aqualina, but I'm not so sure about this one. The initial note of citrus seems to overpower the chocolate/hazelnut/vanilla....Once the citrus wears off, it's much better--still a little too spicey and musky, and not as smooth/warm as I'd hoped for. After about 2-3 hours, the vanilla and hazelnut finally come through...but that spicey citrus seems to linger ever so slightly.This perfume shouldn't really be sprayed directly onto the skin, better to spray it in the air and then walk through it. It seems less harsh that way. If you like chocolate covered oranges (some people do) then you'll like this. But I don't think it should be compared to Pink Sugar. Two very different fragrances. I might wear layer it with a creamy vanilla perfume to balance the spice...but I probably won't buy this again."
4,Soft chocolate-y vanilla,"By no means am I a scent pro, but I know what I like. I love wearing it and often get compliments. It smells great when you first put it on, smells even better the first half-hour or so. Then it gets very soft, subtle and sexy.It's chocolatey, almost like the scent of a high-quality dark chocolate bar when you first unwrap it. It has some sort of vanilla undertone, or at least that's what my untrained nose thinks. But it works somehow and doesn't have a sweet smell to it.You can wear it to work or dress it up. Some men have found it irresistibly sexy!"
1,Don't Buy This Book,"This book is NOT comprehensive. It's like one of those hardcover books you find in hotels: it recommends only those companies that have bought advertising in the book. For example, there are more than 2 landscape architects in Los Angeles, but you wouldn't know it from this book. It has practically nothing for Orange County despite the subtitle. I'm returning the book (thanks,... for your return policy)."
5,Los Angeles Home Book,"I found this terrific book visually and editorially superior to anything other book out there. It was educational, high-quality and very easy to utilize. The unique shape and tabs allowed me to go right to the category I was searching for and I enjoyed the wonderful photography. As a matter of fact, I am working with a designer that I found in this book. I would highly recommend this resource."
4,under seat storage,"i liked this item very much, however the company messed up by sending the wrong one and i had to call to get reminbursed , i only wanted an exchange and they said they do not do that through amazon , that i have to reorder ,, i did not not even the full amount,not happy with autopartsway ... it was not my mistake."
5,Excellent and clearly written,I got the book from the library and now I'm going to order it. It's very clearly written with good illustrations and diagrams. The author tends to explain things twice which makes it easier to understand the concept.Clearly written and to the point.To Author: you should make an instructional video also
5,Hammered Paint,"I used this on an old formica countertop in a laundry room. It looks phenomenal!!! Not sure how it would hold up in a kitchen, but our guests believe I replaced the countertop with a high-end material! Hah!"
1,The Other Reviewers Have To Be Kidding !,"I tried using this product, and its spray can version, on some unfinished tin tile panels. This paint is similar to working with epoxy glue, but using the spray can is better than the quart cans. It is very thick in order to produce the hammered effect, which by the way it does so-so. It certainly doesn't look like the label suggests. More importantly, there is no brand of rollers known to man, including Purdy, that doesn't get lots of fibers stripped and embedded in the paint. The paint gives you mere seconds to work with it, and if you go over the same area twice within a few seconds like a normal painter does, it produces long strings that become embedded in the paint. It was just a hideous mess. It ruined my project, cost me immense time and expense to strip and repaint, and I complained so bitterly to Rustoleum that I told them to yank it off the shelves. I strongly suggest to others that they use another brand if they want this effect."
5,Excellent Book...,"I read this book a while ago, but I'd have to say it was a very good book and led me to want to read more books about specific ships during the war. I didn't realize that the Pacific Fleet was down to one carrier at a point.After reading this book, I saw that there is a book about the Enterprise, so I picked that one up."
1,Atrocious,"With all due respect to the other reviewers, this atrocious book is so loaded with factual and technical errors that it's hard to know where to begin. I was fortunate to know three Hornet aviators, and the two who lived to read this turkey were appalled that any author would think that the arresting hook goes on the flight deck rather than the airplane! Furthermore, the title is wholly misleading since it refers to a brief period of little activity in the Guadalcanal campaign when the Hornet was the only carrier available. The embarrassing story of the Hornet at Midway still remains to be told objectively, but the bottom line is: the US Navy fought its most crucial battle with two useful carriers against four Japanese veterans."
5,Beautiful book - a family favorite.,"My 22-month old daughter has enjoyed this book for months and we are constantly checking it out of the library. We are finally buying our own copy! The illustrations are lovely and the writing is very lyrical. There are plenty of objects to point to (and have your child identify) to build his/her vocabulary and the active features of the text encourage acting out various facets of the story such as ""walking"" the water, patting the bread, finding the kittens and baby's belly button, etc. I highly recommend this book!"
3,Interesting Proposal But Is It Biblical?,"Rolf Knierim has distinguished himself as an eminent hermeneutician and biblical scholar. His book, The Task of Old Testament Theology, exhibits this sensitive interpretive skill. Many of his essays included in the text are important and without parallel (such as his essay on food in the OT!). However, his approach concerning the systematization of disparate theologies found in the OT according to their substantive priorities seem to be more subjective than objective. In the final analysis, it is Knierim who decides what belongs and what doesn't, e.g., he discards the election of Israel. How can a theme so pervasive as election be discarded with such relative ease? His ""task"" has many interesting proposals, but in the end I don't agree that it reflects a ""biblical"" theology."
1,OLD PRODUCT WITH A BAD ODER....,"Bought this product for my wife. She uses this product all the time, but was tired of the high price the retail store was charging. So, decided to shop the internet. This product was priced right and delivery was quick, however, when my wife opened this product the gel had a strong OLD smell to it......She wasn't happy !!!! I went to the high priced retail store and bought her a new tube and it was fresh with no OLD ODER. Probably should return the two tubes we purchased.....BUT WHAT A HASSEL !!"
5,Joico,"JoiGel is difficult to find at salons around the Seattle area, and I've used it for years. Thanks to Amazon and it's suppliers, I can have it easily shipped to my doorstep within a couple of days after ordering."
1,Crappy,"Face of the block looked like it was cut with a hacksaw, by a blind person. Didn't even check the knives. Returned the same day!"
2,NOT SHARP!,I Love the looks and the weight of these knives and the fact that you are able to install it under a cabinet. However when i try to use it to cut a tougher cut of meat or try to peel a vegetable i was very disappointed. The knives do not seem very sharp. Again VERY VERY disappointed!
2,Two Stars On The Dookie Scale,"I purchased this book and found that it is not even effective for beginners. For example, there is misinformation on the topic of ""Remote Assistance."" Also, how one writes a Windows Server book and leaves out the inner workings of the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) is beyond me.Really just not enough information to suit me."
2,Power on problem,"I've had the 305 for 11 1/2 months now with no issues, and now it fails to power on. Up until now it has worked nearly flawlessly. This unit was not abused, dropped, emersed in water or put through anything negligent. Just normal usage - 75 to 100 miles a week - mostly dry rides. I was very happy with the unit - it has all the features that I need for basic cycling without the 705 bells and whistles. I've tried the FAQ's at the Garmin site and the unit does respond (reset + mode) - but only with it hooked up to a computer via a USB cable. Without the cable, nothing! I searched the web and it turns out the power on issue is a common problem (among other problems). I will attempt to contact customer support to see if they'll fix or replace this unit, otherwise, beware before purchasing the Edge 305!"
4,"garmin 305 for mac, almost","Great gizmo, except for that you can't update firmware from a Mac (yet). It should be noted that the GPS software on the device is a little old, (it was purchased 3/07) but seems to work just fine. I'm not sure what the newer versions provide. The device works as advertised."
1,Sensor Frustration,"I had high hopes for this unit. Trying to get some one from Garmin on the phone to help may take up to an hour! The sensor is not easy to setup for cadence etc.. Can't get the sensor to work on the road bike. Too much of a pain for this feature to work. Riders need candence. Need to go back to the Polar. Too bad, because I liked many of the features, but perhaps Garmin has too many different products to worry about satisfying the bike rider market."
2,"Great, but I'm on my 5th unit...","Clearly a great tool for cycling, and I love it - when it works. But I've now had to return mine for the 5th time, due to the unit shutting itself off mid-ride. Very annoying, and dealing with Garmin customer service is super slow (usually 30-45 minutes on hold before you can find a human)Love it, just wish it were reliable."
1,device might be nice but garmin customer service lacking,"I recently purchased the Edge 305 package (hr monitor & cadence). One of the features that interested me was the altimeter which unfortunately didn't work - kept registering 65000 ft. I checked the firmware which was up to date and then called Garmin. Was left on hold for about 15 minutes, before receiving assistance. The rep was helpful until we determined that the unit was defective and needed to be returned. Garmin wants me to pay for shipping which I could sort of accept if this was an inexpensive device, which it's not. I've had it less than a week, it doesn't work, so I'm at a loss to understand why I need to pay to have it replaced. I'll be taking it back to Target for a refund, and will no longer do business with Garmin."
2,Quality/Service Poor,"I had my Edge 305 for less than a year before it started having problems. The unit just simply powers itself off during high speed descents and rough road patches. I thought this might be due to excessive vibration...so I tried to come up with some different mounts to remedy the problem. The next spring the power issue became overwhelming and I contacted service for repair. To their credit, even though I was about 3 months past warranty, they agreed to cover the repair. I FedEx'd my unit and was told there would be a 10-day turnaround. After 3 weeks I called to find out the status of my RMA...at which point I found out Garmin had LOST my unit. They sent me a refurbished unit. The refurbished unit arrived on a monday. It worked that first day. On Tuesday, the GPS would not acquire any satellites and was worthless. I called Garmin the very next morning and they have agreed to send me a new ""in the box"" unit. However there will be another 10 day lead time."
3,Not waterproof,"Contrary to the advertising this item is NOT waterproof, as admitted by Garmin when I booked my unit in for repair after leaking saltwater whilst on the deck of my kayak. I was immediately offered a replacement at a VERY good price.Other than that, I found it very good with the ability to customise the display, excellent logging of heart rate and speed over time, with ready access to the data via a Mac.I will use it in a waterproof pouch in future, and consider replacing it with the new Garmin Forerunner 310XT GPS/HR Monitor."
4,big improvement over 205,"this unit is great, especially for the price that amazon offers. key additional features relative to 205 are autopause and barometric altimeter. heart rate monitor is fun too. definitely worth the extra money. Would give top marks for service also. The unit started behaving erratically about 90 days after purchase. I sent a note to amazon support, got a quick response with contact info for garmin support, sent a note to them and received a quick response with simple, clear instructions to reinstall the units firmware. works great again."
2,Great when it works,"I loved everything about the 305, except for its proclivity for ceasing to function. I went through three of them in a year. The first one went back to the store where I bought it, the second one was returned to Garmin, the final one was exchanged for a Suunto T6 which I have been very happy with (i.e. it works.)Garmin has released several firmware updates that did address the early problems I was having with the unit, but after the third one simply turned off several times on a commute home I gave up. The low (MUCH lower than the advertised) battery life per charge was frustrating as well. I could have lived with that if the unit had been reliable, but as is, I could not recommend this product. Hopefully the new version will work better."
4,Flexible bike training tool,"Very flexible data display.Computer-side software (PC & Mac) could use some work. Ships with PC only software, but slightly less functional Mac software can be downloaded.Almost everything worked great on my ride up 10,000 foot Haleakala on Maui (really), but the ""percent grade"" number fluctuates too much when you're going up hill at low speed (like when your at 9,000 feet and feeling the altitude).Battery life adequate but not great."
4,"Great product, but the associated SW and Web service could be better","Great product which adds a new dimension to your cycling. Tracking your route, elevation, heart rate, etc is wonderful. Product works as advertized, but may not meet your full expectations: Altimeter function is not consistent, PC Based SW is spartan unless you purchase a $100+ map set, and the Web based service is very slow, cumbersome, and confusing.Having said all that, it is a cool toy"
4,"You're a hero, Lizzie!",I found this book so nice. It tells how Elizabeth Wakefield is a real kind-hearted girl. I think it is just coincidence how she was able to save Denny Jacobson several times. But I'm glad they came up with such brilliant idea to get rid of Denny-and Janet Howell at the same time. Wakefield siblings are incredibly clever!
3,Deborah Crombie mysteries -,"Crombie's mysteries are clever, based usually in England - side mysteries to Scotland. Kincaid and James are a great pair - a bit of romance.Amazing to find out Crombie isn't English - she should be.These are fast reads, great for planes and places you have to wait.I will be sad when I've read them all - and luckily Amazon can always get you the mystery you can't find in the local book stores. Hooray!"
2,B-O-R-I-N-G,"Poor Duncan and Gemma, wracked by suppressed passion, meander through a romance novel thinly disguised as a mystery, The primary mystery: how did this book ever get grouped in the Mystery category?"
4,Duncan and Gemma together again,"This is the fourth book in the Kincaid/James series. Duncan and Gemma are uncomfortable with each other when they are assigned a case that involves a domineering police chief who has been murdered. The case becomes more and more complicated, which leads to a change for Duncan and James.These novels just get better and better."
3,What happened to Jackie?,"I was somehow surprised at the end--not by who killed the unloved police inspector, but by the fact that Crombie left one major issue unsolved: who killed Jackie, and why?"
3,love her lower the keys,"as someone who has enjoyed andreas career since annie and seen her in many regional productions fantastiks annie get your gun etc, i was greatly disappointed by her child like arrangements. listen to the cast recording of jerrys girls and her song on the sand and time heals everything will amaze your. her lower register is smoky and mature. her fans grew up let her mature as well. jerrys girls is proof she can. oh, and lose the daughters castle in the clouds."
4,On Broadway - Andrea McArdle,"This is a somewhat difficult to find title, but well worth the effort. Ms McArdle has had a marvelously strong voice since originally creating the role of Little Orphan Annie in the Broadway production of ""Annie"" (aside: I was lucky enough to catch her in London at the Victoria Palace Theatre, and I don't recall ever having as much fun at a musical production either before or since). In any case, the now grown up lady is all too underrepresented on CD, and if you like show tunes, this eclectic grouping will leave you wanting more from this terrific singer. Her rendition of Never Never Land is straightforward and breathtakingly lovely. Some of the other choices are curious and a matter of taste(too much Lloyd Webber for me), but her interpretations are difficult to fault."
1,WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!,"All I can say is this album is a big disappointment!!! It was cheaply produced and it shows!! No big orchestra or big band to back up Andrea. Her selections of songs are badly chosen for her. What is Andrea singing Rock for? Pinball Wizard and Starlight Express ??? The arrangements for the song show no imagineation!!! As for Andrea's voice.. it still is powerful... this album just doesn't show it . Please Andrea if you ever get a chance to record another album... get somebody with taste and talent to produce for you. As I stated this album is a big disappointment... well maybe ""Tomorrow"" will big a better album for Andrea!!!"
1,WORST DVD I'VE EVER PURCHASED,"I have no idea how this product has gotten good reviews. This is without question THE worst DVD I have EVER purchased ANYWHERE. I have nothing but ill things to say of it so let me start:1. It's SUPER, SUPER CHEAPLY made. It comes with an actual computer-printed sticker on it. And yet they charge $25 for this??? What???2. It's HORRIBLY formatted and you'll be lucky if you can get it to play all the way through on your player. The menus are also AWEFUL. The video quality is VHS quality as this is a ""video to DVD transfer.""3. The instruction is HORRIBLE. Boring, non-repetitive, very hard to learn from. If you can learn Karate from this DVD, then you must be a reincarnated Samurai because I don't see how anyone else could learn from this.4. Did I mention what they charge for this? Oh, by the way, the cover is printed off of what appears to be an inkjet printer too!AVOID THIS PRODUCT AT ALL COSTS OR YOU WILL HATE YOURSELF IN THE MORNING."
2,Disappointing,"I purchased this DVD based off the reviews. It is not meant to be something for kids -- only someone who is serious enough to edure the slowpaced instruction. The instructioni s accurate, just very boring. My children who are very excited about Karate, couldn't make it through this."
5,"Great Treatment for Dry, Damaged Hair","This product was a lifesaver for me. I had gotten my hair colored and permed, and it turned into straw. It tangled terribly even with conditioners and became totally unmanageable. My beautician recommended this product. It worked miracles, making my hair soft and manageable again. It kept me from having to shave my head! I had ordered extra boxes, but it fixed the problem so quickly that I ended up not needing those extra boxes. This is a great product!"
3,nice intro to trio sonatas but nothing ground breaking,"It is an ok collection. Nothing really spectacular about it.The pieces are fine. The playing is ok, but not at the same level of London Baroque or the Academy of Ancient Music. The playing style also reminds me recording from the 50's before the period-instrument and period-style started to emerge."
5,Every child should have this,This is possibly the best children's book out there - and there are some great ones. In a world of TV and video games we need to learn to quiet our minds and LISTEN. Not just for children. I have read this book to several adults. So far I have bought three copies. Get it!
2,One of two chairs came damaged~!,"The chairs are nice and sturdy, however, one of the bar stools had some damage. The box was damaged as well. I agree with a reviewer of the bar table (still in transit...) Amazon needs to pay attention to how these products are shipped. I am not happy about having to now deal with a return! this shouldn't happen as often as it appears ,through other furniture reviews on here, to happen."
1,Do not buy,Do not buy this product. The plastic is weak and poorly molded. The lead threads are not well formed causing the threads to strip during installation. Our of four caps only two were able to thread onto the valve without completely destroying the thread causing the caps to be completely worthless. I give the parts one star on the review only because the program will not allow me to submit without completing the field.
4,Great for little ones,"We purchased this for our daughter's first birthday. She is already interested in coloring and this has NO MESS as it's just water. Our three year old can use it with her which is a huge perk. The only down side is that it is small, so it takes about 3 minutes for them to get it all wet and then it has to dry before they use it again. Drying is quick- about 15 minutes."
5,Awesome Book,"This cloth cover hardcover book is about 2 inches thick, so that no matter how many times you've read it you can always find a poem you've missed. Even if you've already read the book thoroughly, by the time you come back to the first poems you can enjoy them all over again. For some poems there are also little activities for the toddlers or kindergartners to do. Some riddles are found throughout the book too.Since there are indexes of title, first phrases, author, and subject you can easily find a certain poem that you are looking for.The print and pages are old style and there are no illustrations in the book whatsoever, but that is perfectly fine with me as the look of the off white pages full of old fashioned type excites me.I love this book! :)"
3,Nothing to Write Home About!,"I was sort of disappointed by this release from this very promising new British band. The Subways are a good band, but their Young for Eternity effort (their very first effort) isn't on par with the attention they received in Europe in general and the UK in particular.It seems that 10 out of the 12 tracks are premature lyrically and sonically. They're just loud for no apparent reason. It seems like The Subways were trying to find their own special voice with this album and released it half way through the process!The only track I sort of like is She Sun. That's pretty much it.Having said all of that, I still think The Subways have potential. I will give them another chance and buy their next release in hopes that they bring consistency and melody to their work."
4,So much fun!,This is the best cd to just sing along to in your car. If you like the white strips and Franz Ferdinand you'll love this one. I definitely recommend purchasing it.
4,Youthful punk!!,"'Young for eternity' is the energetic garage/punk debut CD from UK trio The Subways. Amazing as they have a sound far more mature than their age suggests.Add a sprinkling of The White Stripes here, and a dash of Ash there and you begin to get the picture of their sound.Opening track 'I want to hear what you have got to say' is a catchy rocker, a great way to open the CD. Similar to this is the delightful 'Oh yeah'.My favourite song has got to be the simple, yet catchy rocker 'Rock & roll queen'. Excellent.Slowing things down are the eerie 'Lines of light', the amazing 'She sun', and the closing track 'Somewhere' with its sudden bursts of angry guitar. There is a lovely upbeat, melodic hidden track after 'Somewhere'.I love the lead vocalists voice, which contrasts sharply (and it works) with the youthful vocals of the female.A great debut!"
2,Less than meets the ear,"Touted as the latest band to bring back punk rock's ""three chords and the truth"" ethical simplicity, the Subways (or their producer) have mistaken ""simple"" for ""simplistic."" Though the band is tight, the performances peppy and the production crisp, there's not really much going on here songwise. ""With You"" is a fine all-around song, and ""She Sun"" manages to power through and ultimately complement sparse lyrics. The other songs are rejumblings of the same hard rock fifths and open triads, set to forgettable words: ""You are the sun/You are the only one/You are so cool/You are so rock and roll."" Even Lindsay Lohan's pop throwaways cut deeper than this."
2,Not this time!,Why can't American Marxists leave Marxist interpretations to Frenchmen? Tbey are much better at it.
5,This is a WOW!,What a neat tool for people needing a nanny or for people that already have hired one! Including all the forms! what a wonderful source of information! again a Wow!
5,Practical Guide for Special Situation,"This handbook for hiring treats hiring a nanny like hiring any other employee. The difference is you are the chain of command, and the only resources for the employment will be the ones you develop. Check the references of the caregiver carefully. Also if you have a documented foreign worker with the right to work in this country and she approaches you about not paying Social Security, tell her that you are no longer interested in her services and you will report her to the INS. This author has been telling us for five years that the INS doesn't understand it's own rules. Now the President seems to agree. If you live in an area where you don't have many options and you hire an illegal alien, get her immunized and protect your child."
5,"It is in the book, ( the CD and online appendix)","The forms in the book are confidence builders for parents because they give you a resource to get all the information you need. Don't be surprised if you don't get back all the applications you send out, particularly the childcare reference form. Applicant's are not going to put down false information when they know you are going to check their references and their background.Solid Information for hire and employment.Small business owners, and people that work from their homes would benefit from the forms in the book and the tax and immigration information available on the site. Specific questions on the ABC application help parents secure information about the strangers they are considering bringing into their homes."
3,Household Employer,"We purchased the book primarily for the forms disk (PDF read-only files). The disk we received with the book had the W32.Pinfi virus. This waisted precious time, as we need to solidify a lead we received for our open nanny position.We contacted the author, Frances Anne Hernan, and she promptly replaced the infected disk. My wife and I appreciated her kind e-mail messages. We understand that Frances contacted amazon.com immediately and the book was taken off the 24 hour availability until she had notified them that she had corrected the problem.Check out Nolo's website. They have a contract you may download."
5,The ABC's of Hiring a Nanny,I found this book extremely informative. The examples given of the job description and how to explain your scheduling needs are very detailed. They make it easy to figure out exactly what you need and expect from a nanny. Also once you have it on paper the prospective nanny will know what you are looking for and whether she is able to provide these services. This book is a must for anyone hiring a nanny and the information would be useful for parents just needing an occasional sitter. It will also make a great gift for first time parents.
1,Not worth the money,"Bought this book hoping for a comprehensive resource of information on hiring a nanny. Boy were we disappointed. As was mentioned in another post - the book is nothing more than a glorified outline, and half of the book is copies of the forms that are on the disk, which forms by the way are in .pdf form and are not even fillable."
2,Reads like an outline,"This ""book"" seems more like an outline for a book. Quick, terse and not very complete or thoughtful. While I'm all for informational books being ""to the point"" and not fluffy, this book really seems like it was never actually completed, and so has not proved very useful to me."
3,Doesn't add much...,"If you're somehow finding yourself in a situation where you need some basic NUnit knowledge, but don't have internet access, then this book can help - some.[...]"
2,No practical info for a nut grower,"Because the author had extensive experience growing vegetables, I hoped Nuts as a Profitable Crop would include some facts about growing nuts. Alas. The book is a count of nut bearing trees from 1899 to 1910, with a smattering of nutritional facts. I thought 7.99 was way overpriced for 27 pages. This book is not relevent for anyone searching for practical info about growing or utilizing nut crops today."
4,Good kit at a good price,"I bought this to replaced a set of hair clippers I had bought at Marshalls or TJ Max for around the same price as this one is available for. When I bought those I was in desperate need of something but my previous set had broken and they were a cheap noisy piece of junk. These are far better, work well to cut the hair, the color coded guides were a brilliant idea and make it easy to find the one you're looking for, and they give a good clean haircut. My only complaint is that I still find these to be a little loud, not as bad as my previous clippers but not as quiet as I was expecting based on the reviews here. Other than that they're great and I'd recommend this product if you're looking for an inexpensive haircutting kit."
4,Very Nice Set that Could Be Improved with a Few Changes,"I wasn't paying close attention when I ordered this item, so I was surprised when it arrived that the ""cleaning brush"" included was so tiny. It's about 10 times smaller than the cleaning brush that was included with my last Wahl set. It's really more of a crevice tool, and it is virtually useless. Luckily, I hadn't gotten rod of my old set yet, so I just kept the old brush. It makes cleaning after a cut so much easier when you have a good brush with very long bristles that can clean inside, between the blades.My other complaint is the numbering system. They've color-coded this system by size, so they've sort of just given up on actually making the numbers on the actual plastic guards uniform or readable. Some of the numbers appear on one side, and some appear on the other. The ones that appear on the back side are tiny and difficult to read. You can see two examples in the photos I've uploaded above."
5,Great long-lasting trimmer,"I've had this trimmer for about 2 years now, I remember buying it on sale for 17.99 at target. I just use it to buzz my head, usually about once or twice a month. I also used it to trim my beard for a little while until I got a separate beard trimmer. This trimmer is great... my hair is pretty thick, but all I have to do is dampen my hair with a little water and I'm done buzzing my head in about 15 minutes. The trimmer itself is thick and a little heavy (which I like), and the motor must be strong because I don't remember it ever catching on my hair. If I had one gripe, its that the little plastic pieces have been starting to get loose, sometimes the ones I use often snap off mid-trim. After 2 years, that might be expected... All in all though, a great product for such a cheap price."
4,Pretty Great,"We got this so I could give my handsome hubby haircuts to save $$. It was super easy to use and in clean up. My only con to this product is that it does not do the job when it comes to getting super close behind his ears and making fine trimming/ shaving to the edges by his neck. Luckily he has a beard trimmer that did the job. Other than that, pretty great!!"
3,Worked great until they broke!,A small piece of plastic broke and the clippers won't turn on. My husband got them for Christmas so we have had them all of 2.5 months. BUMMER!
4,The machine did not had screws on it!,The cutting machine did not had screws so the machine was open so I had to buy some for it and well other than that it is really good and cuts really nice.
4,Works very well,"I bought this attractive-looking, well-stocked haircutting kit as a present for my husband. When I looked it over, I myself found it rather intimidating, and I was not willing to use it to cut his hair for fear I'd mess it up. Fortunately, he figured out how to use the clippers with the perfect setting for his hair after only a few minutes of fiddling with it and barely glancing at the directions. Then, after several tries, he managed to cut his own hair, with me guiding him to only a couple of rough spots that needed a little bit of refining to match the rest of his hair. He likes a very short, military-type haircut, and this works very well for that.It was probably overkill getting a kit this fancy for only my husband's use, but the price wasn't all that high compared to what it will save him over time in the cost of professional haircuts--not to mention the convenience of not having to drive to the barber shop.All in all, it's a great value for the money."
5,Awesomw,after reading some of the reviews I was afraid it would not be so good but it totally is!!! Who rated badly this item has just been very unlucky
4,great for buzz cuts and touch ups,I bought this because I typically just shave my head every time I need a hair cut and occasionally do touch ups around the back of my neck. This razor works great and has saved me tons of money I would have spent at a barber shop. Also great for whenever any of my pals need a shape-up. Would recommend.
5,Perfect grip and size,"This kit was perfect for my husband. It is smaller than most, and the grip on the handle makes it easier to hold onto than most."
3,Wahl Haircutting Kit,Only used the Wahl haircutting kit once = seems to do a good job. I'm still getting use to it.
4,Nice one...,Works as expected... Good for quick haircuts and also regular trimming. Nothing to complain as such. It would have been great if they could have given a small CD on how to cut the hairs.
4,A good buy,it needs the second person to do the job for a decent result. In general it is a ok product at this price!
3,Wahl hair clipper,This clipper didn't cut any better than my $7 Walmart one that was several years old. But it did cut and didn't pull the hair. Plenty of guides for for length.
5,Great for trimming my beard,Decided to keep a beard and got this to help maintain and groom it. Works like a charm! My roommate even uses it to cut his hair. It's easy to use and easy to clean. Who could ask for more?
4,Great Product Unless You Do a Zero,"Its great but say you are a Marine, and like a high and tight then you might need something different to do the zero tapper but its great for everything else."
5,Works for desired purpose,"Used it only twice, but it does the job and gets through the rough hair that other shavers will just quit on."
3,"Great clipper, bad case/package.","Like you, I read various reviews before deciding on this Wahl to replace my old Oster that finally broke. When it arrived, I used it right away to shave in a pinch when my battery operated shaver ran out of juice. Later, I opened 'er back up to cut my hair and noticed two of the guards have broken tines. (the two large ones). It's evident that the way they're all crammed into the hard case causes the tines to crack. Thankfully, my old oster guards fit so there isn't really a need to play the return return return game. The Wahl guards are a little thin in the tines compared to my oster guards. Clipper works well, just be prepared for possible broken guards."
4,Looks GREAT!,Purchased this as a Christmas present for my son. It looks very nice and well made. Think my son will be very happy with this! Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is cause I didn't try the clippers out ... guess I shouldn't since it is a present! P.S. Love shopping 24/7 on Amazon.com; they have great prices and FAST shipping!
3,Engineering issues,"I bought this today (not from Amazon, but from a Fry's nearby) based on all the good reviews, so was surprised to find some obvious, annoying drawbacks. I think the unit has a motor much stronger than the body that houses it, with the result that the body vibrates uncomfortably and gets annoyingly warm. If the plastic guide is not seated right, you hear this very loud noise that will make your heart skip a beat. And last but not least, the rocker switch button offers a lot of resistance. If you frequently turn it on-off during a 10-15 minute cut, as you adjust, change guides, and take pauses, your thumb will start hurting.I had a 5 year old Remington, ten dollars more expensive, that never had these issues. Of course, it's motor was probably not as powerful, but I did not find it needing any more than what it already had.One plus for this Wahl unit is that the blades feel a bit sharper - but I cannot tell for sure, and in any case, it is too early to say if it will stay that way."
1,need to return,My partner used this for less than a minute before it burned out and completely stopped working and filled my room with smoke!Would like seller to contact me.
5,Cheap and work well,"Granted I am by no means a barber or professional stylist, but for trimming up around the ears or just getting rid of some weight for the summer, these are great. There are plenty of guards to choose from so you have a lot of options for length. Also includes the ear guards as well as some combs and scissors. Pretty great deal in my opinion."
5,As expected,the clippers work well. They were shipped on time and arrived on time. seven more words: one two three four
4,Works as expected,"It is a nice clipper and appeared reasonable with the price at $20 at the time. However, I had to deduct a star as it did not contain a cover to prevent hair falling onto your clothing. There were other clippers advertised at a similar price, albeit a bit more, but they contained the cover and a trimmer. It would have also been nice if the storage case was a bit bigger or made of a more flexible material such as a bag, that way everything could fit inside easily when being repackaged.After all is said and done, I would still purchase it again if I had to and if you're trying to pinch those extra few dollars like I was, it is worth it."
4,"So Far, So good","We just received this the other day and have only used it once. We had the Wahl Peanut for 6 years and it finally died. I don't think we took care of it properly, but we vow to do better this time!This kit is great. It comes with everything you would need, but it all just piles into the case. There isn't a way to organize it - so beware when you open it up! Also, it's really loud. Much louder than the peanut and it's heavy! Those are the only 2 reasons I didn't give this 5 stars. Other than that, for $25 it can't be beat!"
3,Not a hairdresser,"I bought the Wahl 79300-400 Color Pro 20 Piece Complete Haircutting Kit thinking I could give my son (age 2) haircuts. The trimmer cut well and there is an instruction guide for male hair cuts in the kit. I have tried three times now, waiting for his hair to grow out each time. Each haircut was super bad, so the instruction guild was not fool proof. What I learned was cutting hair is a lot harder than it looks. I think I will give up and take him to a barber."
2,Not Working property,Not Working property. Cuts good but has annoying sound. Left side on the Kit has regulated screw for this sound problem but it not working property
1,why :(,"never thought i would have to give a bad review for an amazon sold product, this clipper works really good, smooth, cuts clean but omg !! wahl i am certain it cost just a few cents to produce these guards, for crying out loud its an American product, i gave my two sons a hair cut today and the guards kept opening out and leaving patches, i feel like throwing the whole damn thing in the garbage, i had a con air before that worked fine for years and the only reason it gave up is because i thought i would give it a tune up and dulled the blades, yes some people will say you get what you pay for but i could have gotten a no name brand for the same price, but i went for the name, i am sorry wahl this is my first wahl product and it will be my last, very very very disappointed customer"
4,Great so far,"After 12 uses it still works as good as new. It has already paid for itself 8 times over. Seems well built and is made in the USA. Very happy so far, hopefully it will last another 100 uses."
3,It works,"These are definitely a clipper that you get what you pay for. Not the best available, but I would say they're not the worst either. I would bump the rating up a half star for the haircuts it has already provided saving me about $20 a pop. The product seems to be holding up okay, and the cuts hair okay. Just okay."
4,Great product for the $$,"My husband uses this, and well, so far, it's still working!He uses it about once a week for chest, arms etc. I notice it is slightly heavy, which can tire your arms if using for awhile.Colour coded trimmers are a must have now because of this product....I love that feature! So far the trimmers stay on nicely, and don't fall off. Comes with cleaning instructions and oil, this is one of the better trimmers my husband has had. Packages all into a nice container so it's not strewn all over the bathroom.Would definitely recommend."
5,great shaver!,I bought this to shave my boys heads and it is great. It is easy to use and is very durable. One of my best buys for saving money.
5,Good Product,"Works great, plenty of power, better than cordless versions as their batteries will eventually go bad and are not replaceable."
5,Great Haircutting Kit,Normally I pay 20 bucks for a haircut. I'm a guy and don't get anything special done to my hair so I figured might as well start doing this myself. Found these clippers on Amazon for 20 bucks and have used it once so far. Razor was very powerful and cut through my hair (which definitely isn't thin) like butter. The color coding is nice and let me find the 2 sizes I use easily (after referring to the chart on the razor itself). It's already paid for itself too. 5/5 stars.Only bad thing about cutting my own hair is it's tricky to get the hairline on the back lined up properly. Guess I'll need someone else to do that if I really care about it looking nice.
4,Prefect For Cleaning Up,Works awesome for when I have to shave my male pattern baldness head of mine. easy to find the right side clippers for trimming up my beard as well. only thing I would suggest find a new case for it. The case it flimsy and I am afraid it will break on me at anytime.
2,Beware - clips are extremely fragile and are prone to shatter during shipping.,"I was more than a little disappointed when I opened the case and discovered that half of the clips were reduced to small plastic shards. Amazon was more than cooperative in resolving the issue; however, do not order this product expecting it to be pristine and intact. Trimmer itself is fabulous; clips are shoddy."
1,Malfunctioned after 5 uses,"I bought these clippers less than two months ago to replace my old Conair clippers that I left behind while traveling. I use my clippers exclusively for beard trimming. After no more than five or six uses the blades got misaligned, causing an extremely loud buzzing and painful pulling of my beard. I whacked it back into place the first few times it did it, but now that doesn't even work. Extremely disappointing and a waste of money. I never should have left the Conair brand."
1,Be Careful! I'm currently bleeding from a defective one!,We have years of experience using hair clippers in our household. We just bought this locally to replace a lithium cordless Wahl that died in 10 months after only 10 uses.This Wahl color pro looked fine but when my wife trimmed my neck we found out the hard way that the metal blade guard was screwed on slightly crooked and one side of the blades teeth were exposed to saw into my skin. I had high hopes for this with all the positive reviews but this one is dangerous. I am going to go with a different brand after owning two defective Wahl products.
1,not working,"maybe I got a defective product, this one made loud noise and shaked badly. I can barely hold it after 3-5min. I sent it back to amazon, the customer service refund it without any problem"
2,Nice kit except for the trimmer itself,I want to like this trimmer. It is attractive and has a wonderful user friendly design with lots color coded trimmer guide attachments with a convinient legend printed on the trimmer itself. Corded means it should have no shortage of power unlike the cordless trimmers I have owned in the past which can run out charge mid trim - awkward!Alas it is not so. This trimmer is so ridiculously underpowered it struggles to cut my hair. Brand new fresh out of the box with supposedly sharp blades. What happens over time as the blades lose their edge? I suppose the upside is that it is so weak it won't hurt much when it starts pulling my hair.Very disappointed.
4,So far so good.,"Bought this because my son has decided he wants very short hair. I've watched the girls at the salon buzz his hair and it didn't seem too hard. And he's a boy. Trimmed his hair easily. We aren't planning on fancy haircuts, so this works just fine. No complaints at this time."
3,okay for the price. Switched to a cordless clipper,It cuts the hair okay. But I returned it as I prefer cordless clippers. Not the best bag in the world either.
4,I like it,"Current item was good smuts and gentle, I use it for my 5 y/o son he like it too. So we are happy."
3,Decent clippers,Decent clippers with color coded combs helps keep me organized when I am cutting my husband's hair. They work well enough to get the job done. Worth the investment.
4,Good product,I like this product and the brand y very like. I used this many times and is very nice. I like it.
3,like the color coding,"Our old one works as good as this new one. Not special, but alright. Heavy. color coding good feature. Good to have on hand."
4,Great bang for your buck,"To be truthful, I wasn't expecting a lot for this price. I just wanted to experiment with cutting my own hair, and my son's, without a hefty investment.The unit itself was solid, and had a latch for cleaning - big plus. This is not a disposable trimmer - better quality than I figured for the price. Maybe a little heavier than other models/brandsAll the height level attachments worked, and even used the left and right clips for my son's head. Worked perfectly the first time. I like to use a #1 on myself, so I'm trimming every couple of weeks without any pulling.Overall, it definitely exceeded my expectationsPros: all the components, solid trimmer, carry case, scissors, combsCons: weight (gotta switch hands every once in a while)"
5,Best beard trimmer ever owned,"I recognize that this is for heads of hair, but this product is easily the best beard trimmer I've ever owned. It costs about the same as other beard trimmers I've owned but because it is built for thick heads of hair, it makes trimming my beard take literally seconds. I also enjoy that it has a cord because I have a terrible time with leaving the cord at various places during travel or destroying the battery life from leaving it plugged into the wall for too long. I couldn't be more pleased with this product.Adjustable base for varying levels of five o'clock shadow and a clip on pieces for a little more depth in man-scaping other areas of the body."
4,good razor,This haircutting kit does the job and does it really fast and easy. I like that its even made in the US.....rare thing these days
5,"great product, very strong","I loved it, I read some bad reviews and almost didn't buy it, I wanted to cut my own hair because I'm low maintenance when it comes to hairthis product works very well and feels very stronghighly recommend it if you have doubts"
1,Clippers were sent to us USED and full of someone else's hair!!,"The clippers arrived a day earlier which we were thrilled about. Unfortunately, as soon as we took it out of the amazon box it was obvious that the item had been used and returned. The box was scraped, worn, and poorly taped. We crossed our fingers that just the packaging was damaged, etc and the clippers would be new and unused....Not the case, in fact it was quiet the opposite. The body of the clippers (plastic) was dinged and scratched, and the blades were absolutely filthy and disgusting full of hair and God only knows what else! The seller should NOT be allowed to resell clippers, or other items that have been returned USED! To say that we were offended by this would be putting it lightly! I wish that I could write a positive review or add some feedback as to how the clippers work, but unfortunately I can't do that until we receive new unused clippers."
1,Got an used product.,Noticed finger prints and stuck hairs on the blade after opening the package. There could be some improvement made in the packaging of this product so that once opened it can't be sealed back.
1,Not Built to Last,"When I first got these clippers, I was pleased. They seemed to work just fine, and the price was right. After five or six months, they were no longer cutting hair evenly. Today, eight months after purchasing, the clippers won't stay on. They just turn off mid-haircut, and come back on after a minute or two. I understand that they weren't the most expensive clippers, but I did expect them to last for more than 8 months."
2,Terrible durability,"When I first got this product it seemed to work great, however after having only had it for about 6 months, it's already broken. I'm not sure what the problem is, but the on and off switch no longer works properly. When flipping the switch it's like I had to hover it between off and on in just the right location to make it work, and even then it eventually just gave out and the switch wouldn't even move.They also don't use stainless steel so the metal blades rust. I noticed this almost immediately. One time, because of this, after turning it on, the blades seized up and wouldn't work. After moving the height adjustment switch (which moves the blades), all of the rust broke off and it started to work again...I mean what the hell!?This product is cheap but you get what you pay for."
3,Okay... if you have thin hair,I owned a Wahl that I bought from SAMs club for the same price as this one which lasted me a good 7 years with regular oiling... it worked fine with no issues but I thought it was time for a replacement so I purchased this one... but this Wahl clipper jammed more than once and I had to stop mid cut to brush off hair and get it started again. My previous Wahl can cut through my thick hair like butter... this Wahl unfortunately does not have the same performance... I have a feeling that after a few more cuts to get my money's worth I will purchase a more powerful higher quality one... don't get me wrong - this one will do the job... but if you have thick hair and plan to use it to groom pets I suggest look elsewhere for a higher quaility and more powerful clipper...
5,"So far, so good","I just purchased this haircutting kit about 1 month ago, and I've already cut my hair twice. My hair does grow pretty quickly and thickly, but this cut straight through my hair without any issues. The razors I've used in the past get jammed with my hair, but this one had no issues. The variation in lengths is great, although I stick to a shaved head with #1. Best razor for the best value."
5,Great product!,"I love this haircutting combo. My first cut went smoothly and the motor is STRONG. If you are looking for something to replace the Great Clips visit once every few months, I cannot recommend this strongly enough."
5,Works great,"Love this for giving my son his hair cuts, cuts really sharp and smooth and is very quiet so he doesnt freak out like he does with other clippers"
1,horrible,I previously had a wahl razor but it broke so i needed a new one. this one barely cut my hair. i had uneven peices and i had to go over every little section multiple times. this razor did not meet my expectations. now i have to put forth more money to get a working razor.
4,Good Product,This is a very good set of cutters. It comes with everything you need to cut the styles you want. The machine is very effective. I've used it successfully and I'm satisfied with the results. I'm very happy with this purchase.
5,Excellent hair clippers!,"I was looking for something relatively cheap so my wife could cut my hair for me. The price for these hair clippers was right so I decided I would give them a try. These cut the hair perfect and come with a lot of attachments for different lengths. The first time we used this I had extremely thick and long hair, but this had no problem cutting through it! Now if I could only get my wife to be a little better at cutting hair I would be all set!"
4,Love this thing. Every guy should have one.,"Great price for this. Does the trick, doesn't jam up, so much more affordable, time-saving, and kind of fun to just do my boyfriend's hair ourselves! Some of the guards are harder to use than others and at one point we cut my boyfriend's hair way too short in one area, but it grew back. I'm pretty sure that was my fault anyway, but practicing with one of these is hard just becasue, well, what are you going to practice on but hair? Other than that, great purchase!"
5,The stork brought me love,"I love these clippers. I'm considering barber school and a homemaker of just one son and these clippers made it easy to make sure my little man still got his head right on a budget(or lack thereof haha). My husband is tremendously picky on who cuts his hair and he allowed me to, Wahl got the job done. And good for the price including all the accessories. Love."
4,Good but shows limits due to price...,"The good:Strong motor, blades are sharp, and cuts well. The case holds the trimmer and attachments. The color coding is nice and does help find the attachment you are looking for. Cord is good average length.The bad:The plastic case of the trimmer has little peices that over hang where the body is put together. The switch (on/off) is small and feels cheap.Over all I am happy. You can see they had to cut some corners to get into this price point but the cuts are on items that are minor to me as long as it holds up longterm."
4,Good clippers for basic use,These clippers are easy to use for beginners. It includes all the attachments to go around ears and for any length. The color coding comes in handy as well. I live with two other guys who envy my clippers and often ask to use it despite having their own.
5,Solid product for the cost,"I decided to buy a pair of clippers to cut my own hair instead of getting it done. It seemed hard to justify the $15-$20 for someone to pass clippers through my hair. I read many of the reviews on these and they are as solid as people described. It's almost surprising what you get for the price. It cuts very well, has a solid build and it's already paid for itself after one haircut."
4,Solid and works well.,"Pros: works well and has good power. Doesn't make a lot of noise and has a nice buzz to the motor. I only use it once in awhile, but for the price, its a good product."
4,Excellent clippers,"These clippers really do work great. Plenty of power, and plenty of extras included. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is due to the shoddy carrying case that these clippers come with. The latch on the case can probably only be opened and closed a handful of times before it snaps off completely. Still, for the price this is pretty tough to beat."
5,NICE clippers,"great clippers....they are more powerful than my last WAHL clippers.....i just wanted a new pair....i even used these to cut my dogs thick hair...they worked fine...NO,they are not the ""multi-speed"" $150 pet trimmers but they cut as good as the $100 ANDIS barber clippers with the steel guards....these guards #1-#8 and are plastic, but snap on tightly...my only suggestion is if you have longer hair on the top of your head...buy the extra #10 & #12 WAHL blades on AMAZON....it does make cutting your hair even faster....the point is for $20 these work great for everyday needs...you wont be dissapointed"
4,Good for the price,"It's a pretty good Haircutting kit for the price. Since I'm cutting my own hair these days, I wanted something that was easy enough for self use as well as for my significant other to use if she is cutting my hair. This works. It seems durable enough to last a few years, though I only cut my hair once or twice per month and I don't use a guard; I keep it short.We ended up with two of these, because of a shipping error. The second we donated to the Cancer Unit that my SO works on and she uses it to cut the hair of her patients and has also been very pleased. It gets more use on her unit than in our home, but overall, both clippers have been as good or better than expected."
1,Ok clippers poor accessories,"The clippers were good , nice weight to them happy with what I paid and got I guess. But the accessories were horrible. None off the guards stayed straight.( they move to the left and right) this caused uneven heights. I put the #3 guard on and wow worst guard iv ever used. It looked like a lawmower got me half was a 3 and gaps were 2( since the guard blades do not stay straight. My cheap clippers worked way better. I can only uses these clipper for right before I shave super waste."
1,Not worth the money bad quality,"Overall I found the quality of the cut to be less than desirable when compared to clippers by Oster. The clipper does not cut evenly with the guide combs and leaves my hair stepped when using a No.1 or No.2 clip. For a simple trim just using a No.2 clip I have to spend nearly 30mins going over the same areas over and over again to try to get it smooth.Recently I purchased a No.1-1/2 guide comb. I did not think I could get more disappointed but I was wrong. The No.1-1/2 clip leaves my hair more uneven than before. The problem is that the teeth on the guide bend as easy as a sheet of paper, and the clip continuously falls off during operation. Twice it fell off and I nearly dug the metal trimmer in to my scalp."
1,Completely rusted out after only one use,"I can't say how bummed I am that this happened. I was very confident in purchasing this hair cutting kit for my boyfriend because of all the 5 star ratings, not to mention the esteemed ""Wahl"" branding, but I have to say that this just doesn't hold up. We were so pleased with the cut when we used it the first time and were happy with the product...until a month later. We reached for the Wahl kit, stored under the sink, only to find it completely rusted out and unusable. Before you say ""it was probably too damp,"" I will tell you that under our bathroom sink is very dry, and it was only there for storage for about 2 weeks (was in the closet before with his things). Maybe the metal they use is just cheap stuff because it oxidized quickly. Just a fair warning because the return policy only lasts for a month...and thats really how often a man needs a haircut. I just advise purchasing with caution. Hope this helps."
1,It's too loud,"I purchased this cutter because of the brand WAHL, had this brand before; but nothing like this! It's just too darn loud! No matter what position I adjust the power screw it's just still too loud! Minimum adjustment is nice & quiet but blades don't move. Can't say I will not buy this brand again; but this item is a real disappointment."
3,Are you serious??,"Maybe I'm stupid.... Is this just for the Docking station? I was going to buy this but unable to even locate one. Blah! I love my Archos 604 but it comes with a USB conection and also same cord charges player. All I did was buy Xilisoft DvD Ripper and Xilisoft video converter. (Two seperate programs) $35. bucks each, and good to go..."
4,Archos DVR is a Good Product,Product was everthing as advertised... I enjoy the full-featured portability remote control. I only wish the docking station could be made even smaller.
2,Pillow fell FLAT,"I was very excited to know the product was from a renewable/reusable source. However, after one night of sleeping on the pillow the ""High Loft"" pillow was not so ""high"". The pillow is already about 1/2 its original height, and I haven't even slept on it for a month. In fact, I have already switched back to my old pillow. I hope they continue to improve technology to make pillows out of a recycled source, but until then, I would not recommend the product."
5,Turn It Up,"For anyone who loves Erasure's style, this is a must-have CD. You can really tell that Erasure respects and admires ABBA; Erasure brings a lot of energy to ABBA's hits. Back in the '80s, I had to turn up the radio every time Erasure came on. If you get this CD, you'll want to turn up the volume yourself. A more talented duo of artists than Erasure would be very hard to find. Everything Erasure does has a lot of pizzazz, and this is no exception."
2,"Big fan of ABBA and Erasure, but...","I love love love ABBA and Erasure! However, the only song I like from ABBA that Erasure re-recorded is ""Take A Chance On Me"" and if you want to hear that, I recommend buying the best of Erasure, it's the last song on that album and you'll love the rest too."
5,Erasure + Abba = pure pop bliss,"It seems that every couple of years brings a new CD, movie, or stage show that pays tribute to the enduring appeal of Scandinavian pop supergroup Abba. Well, Erasure's CD ""Abba-esque"" is one of the best of these Abba homages. This CD contains Erasure's versions of 4 of Abba's most recognizable songs: ""Lay All Your Love on Me,"" ""S.O.S.,"" ""Take a Chance on Me,"" and ""Voulez-Vous."" Erasure stays true to the spirit of the songs while invesing them with Erasure's distinct pop style."
4,A Nice Sample of High Energy Erasure,"It was said somewhere (I can't remember where) that this album should have made Ace of Base redundant. Now I like Ace of Base, but this album does upstage them a little. Of the four tracks, S.O.S. sounds the most like the Swedish quartet and is probably the weakest song on the disc. The single, 'Take a Chance on Me', however, is better but is really only the third best. Lay All Your Love on Me is probably the best, fitting in seamlessly among Erasure's own hits. Voulez Vouz is my personal favourite though. It's just a great high energy piece that doesn't let up until the end. If you're in the mood for a quick blast of high energy music, pop these four songs in your player. I only wish they'd included more ABBA songs on this album (they've done some more ABBA tracks as B-sides that they should have tacked on to this CD)."
5,A fine performance,"This is yet another fine CD by Zdenek and Bedrich Tylsar, two of the principle horn players of the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra.I have become a big fan of the Tylsar's playing and the Vivaldi piece was the main reason I purchased this album. It is performed with the precision and beauty which I have come to expect from Zdenek and Bedrich.While the solos in the CD are very good, I found that the actual compositions share the spotlight with the orchestra more than some of the other Tyslar CDs I have. This is certainly not a bad thing, but if you are looking for a CD with a larger spotlight on the soloists, I'd recommend one of the other Tylsar CDs, such as ""Concertos for 2 Horns."""
4,Finally not something made for the novice!,"I have been looking for good textbooks on this subject for quite some time, as most texts don't have much to offer me. (I have a BS in Animal Science with extensive work in behavior.) The text seems clearly written and well organized. I also like the way the author talks about where we lack on each subject - where more reseach is needed. A very good book for the scholar type. But defintely not for newcomers!"
5,"Informative, innovative and comprehensive","I saw galley-manuscripts of chapters from this book a few months before its release. From personal experience (bringing my dog as a patient to Dr. Overall,) I can attest that the author is dedicated, innovative, informed, and informing. She explains things very well in writing as well as spoken, and makes the process very accessible"
3,Clinical Behavioral Medicine for Small Animals,Great analytical book...however author strongly agrees in medicating pets...enough said.
1,Does *not* work for XP. I tried ...,"I downloaded the patch from the Atari site. I disabled ZoneAlarm firewall. I turned on ZoneAlarm and allowed total access for the Scrabble executable. I tried several different options for Compatability Mode. I turned off internet access altogether. I tried to do ALT-ESC and ALT-TAB to get out of the program and figure out what was going on.None of these made any difference. Each and every time I tried to start this on Windows XP SP2 the program give the Black Screen, requiring a reboot to recover.Playing a game should not be this much work. Highly *not* recommended."
3,so-so,"This book, while challenging, may be too easy for those past 7th grade, yet to hard for those below fifth. also, the layout is extremely confusing"
2,Not very impressive,"I was expecting some interesting points about the camera and how to use etc. But basically both the CD's shows where the menu's are and some explanations of it. That is it. I have a feeling that 50-60% of the contents are generic, they attach with every video and rest about menus. Not impressed at all."
1,Not Really That Helpful,"I thought the presentation was just average. I had hoped that the video would spend more time showing you the features and allowing you to duplicate it with your camera; sought of allowing you to ""get the feel of the camera."" Nagy does go through all of the features but it is just that...He points to where they are found and that is all...I could have gotten this from reading the manual. I also got the sense that he was going faster through the more complicated features as the video progressed. Nikon's menu's are easy to follow and more thorough. Didn't need a video to do just that..don't waste your money..disappointed."
2,Not terrible but there are better options,"I agree with a couple other posters, this video has a lot of ""canned"" content that is probably used over and over in this companies videos. Also the Blue Crane Digital video was more informative and generally far better produced. This video does have a decent amount of content for the D200, but the Blue Crane Digital video is ALL about the D200. Both have some basic info for beginers that some may find ""beneath"" their skill level, but the both have some good info for anyone who isn't extremely familiar with the layout of this particular camera. If I was only buying one I'd definitely buy the Blue Crane DVD over this one."
1,Great Music Ruined by Poor Production,"This CD features 13 pieces of music, which are broken down into 6 tracks. For example, selections from ""The Bartered Bride"" are one solid track. You cannot listen to Polka, Furiant, or Dance of the Comedians without first listening to the Overture. Janacek's Five Maravian Dances also form a single track. Fortunately, the music itself is very enjoyable (4 Stars). I specifically purchased this CD because I also have the Naxos ""The World of Digital Classics, Sampler 3""."
3,good performances and recording,"This disk contains:Track 1: Dvorak's polonaise from RusalkaTrack 2: the overture, polka, furiant and Dance of the Comedians from the Bartered Bride, almost 19 minutes of music in 4 movements put on 1 track.Track 3: Dvorak's Scherzo CapricciosoTrack 4: Janacek's five Moravian dances, on a single track.Track 5: one (probably the most popular) of Dvorak's Slavonic Rhapsodies, op 45/2.Track 6: Smetana's Vlatava (the Moldau) from Ma Vlast (My Country.)All are reasonably well performed and recorded. I don't think mixing four pieces covering almost 19 minutes makes sense and it certainly isn't convenient, but with the Moravian dances (which aren't frequently recorded) and available presently in the Amazon marketplace for 1 cent used or 1.99 new (both plus shipping) this is a good bargain despite having multiple movements on a single track."
1,Awfully expensive for not much content,"For the price I was expecting an expert level, in-depth analysis of the travel industry. Instead I received a book half filled with white space, codes that any professional can cut and paste next to their terminal and learn in a matter of days and photocopies of forms (like ticket stock), all designed for a reader with a 10th grade education.No wonder people complain about the quality of travel agents; ask your agent if he/she read this book, if so, find another agent."
4,Love this bridle,"This is the second Gatsby bridle I have purchased from Horseloverz and I love it as much as the first one, which I still have I just needed another one for a second horse. The first one I Purchased over 5 years ago, use every day and it is still in great condition! Definitely worth it's price!"
4,Integration of Theology,"Wesley is such a complicated figure that any attempt to explain him must be a daunting task. Maddox is well qualified to take on the task. One aspect I appreciate in this book is Maddox's input to a growing trend of Wesleyan scholars that see Wesley's theology as more of an attempt at synthesis (Protestant, Roman, Eastern) than blazing new ground. This removes Wesley from the fringe of historic Christianity (much to the chagrine of reform theologians) and places him smack dab in the center.Does Maddox accomplish his task? You be the judge of that.ONE WARNING: As you can tell by my review, this is not light reading. If you aren't prepared for it, this book may end up gathering dust on your shelf."
1,WHY REINTERPRET A CLASSIC?,"Admittedly the illustrations are interesting, dark and well done; they are just completely out of place with the original tale told by this poem.There is no need to reinterpret the historical references in this poem into a gangster story set in New York. Cops and robbers are not King George's men, an urban landscape is NOT an inn and purple moors.I think your own imagination does a better job conjuring up the images described in this poem. There is no need for a comic book version just because it appeals more to the mass market. The trend towards grabbing the attention of young people by shoving this kind of story out to the public in the marketplace and libraries ranks right up there to me with Shakespeare done as a graphic novel. It is an insult to their intelligence. Of course if you set low standards, students will always reach them. It is high time we raised ours."
3,Not for young children,"Please disregard Publisher's Weekly that this is a book for children 4-8 and that the pictures of the suicide/murder at the end are ""not graphic"". Did the person writing the review take their cue from Roger Ebert who likes anything violent? I love this poem, but as a K-8 teacher I can safely say that this book is NOT for children under the age of 10 at least."
1,Hold up Western Boot,"It's a beautiful boot, like the style, looks very good ; but, it's so uncomfortable , feet hurt after a couple minutes walking, you can't go for a walk with that, that boot is so stiff , i've never had such an incomfortable boot in all my life.So it's the look VS the Comfort?! I guess its worth the price!"
3,Good,"There is nothing ""simple"" about acting & this wordy, detailed book will prove it. Though written in so much deep detail that it can be off-putting to some, if you are serious about acting you will learn so much necessary skill from this book."
5,Eg gets some recognition!,"This album was a great album at the time. I never understood why it wasn't more successful. Eg is a modest lad but deserves more recognition of his song-writing talent and now he's got it. He just won an Ivor Novello award for ""Best song musically and lyrically"" of 2003.http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3755007.stm"
4,Great Album This Is What Put G-unit On The Rap Game Map,"First Off beg for mercy is a great album , it was a bringin out party for 50 , Bank$ and Buck who later had very succesful albums , this album brings you some hott tracks as stunt 101 , poppin them thangs , smile , wanna get to know ya and my personal favorite g-unit song to date ""My Buddy"" , if you are a true g-unit fan or even hip hop fan you will like this album"
4,"Interesting, but too much Message","This book had tons of information and great stories but it also had almost 3 pages of political jargon at the start of each chapter. If you can wade through the ""commercials"" for private contracting you will enjoy this book."
3,Good item. Use occasionally.,"I suffered from VERY severe plantar fasciitis. So, I've tried about every possible product I could find. I bought these to aid in my recovery. I found them to be okay. They're VERY, VERY well made. High quality product. And, VERY good instructions and video. But, because it's such a passive device, and a broad spread of force, I feel like they are better used for intermittent stretching. And, this specific model is VERY hard. The ad reads as much. But just know, that if you have tender feet, it will take time to work up. Again, a VERY well made product. I just found more active techniques like rebounding, stretching and massaging, to work better for my condition."
3,Not what I expected!,"Reading the title I expected rollers. Beware, nothing rolls at all. I should have done more research into ""Yamuma Body Rolling"" because I read this as ""Rolling Footsavers"". My fault! Once I was past my initial disappointment I tried the product and it worked ok. Relieved some of my foot pain initially but no lasting benefit."
3,"Very Painful, Little Benefit","I don't think these will cause any lasting damage, but be aware that using them can be very painful--particularly in the arch region of the foot.I think it is useful to work the feet with these massagers, but I find it rather difficult to balance on them and can't bear to put my full weight, standing, on them (except in the toe and heel parts of my feet).I don't see any lasting benefit or improvement in my feet after using these, but I don't have any significant foot problems to begin with. If you like to work your feet, try them, or just get some of those prickly feet massage balls and sit down while you work your feet. I have also used racquetballs even though Yamuna says you shouldn't. I haven't experienced any damage from sitting down and rolling my feet over them."
3,Nifty 403101 Catch-All,Nice finish - they move around too much - the Dakota does not have the factory holes to fix the mats in place
5,Pleasant Mozart,I love Mozart! He doesn't have anything bad. This dance music is great stuff. I can envision the courtiers bowing and moving in time to the rythmic cues in the music. Great stuff!!
3,Nice at first,I really liked this product at first - it went on nicely and provided some light coverage. But it doesn't go on well when your skin is dry. The product separates and gets runny if it gets exposed to heat. That has happened to two tubes for me now so I won't bother buying it again.
4,Tube seemed half full...,I like this stuff but I wouldn't say I'm in love with it. I do love the powder in tender rose by LM. This stuff is nice -- just didn't knock my socks off. The biggest issue I have is that it almost seems like the tube is half full. I would hate if they sent me a return from someone that was half used. Next time I'll buy direct to be sure.
4,A REAL STEP AND FACE SAVER,"Always on the lookout for what would get me off and running more quickly in the morning, I heard about this Tinted Moisturizer from Laura Mercier. It does the trick. There's no longer a need for me to use moisturizer, wait for it to be absorbed, and then apply foundation.Should mention up front that the natural look is my preference so I'm attracted to formulations with just a hint of color. Of course, the addition SPF 20 is a very real and practical bonus.When using this skin tends to have a very natural look but ""better,"" if you will. My skin is fair so I use ""Porcelain,"" which takes away the paleness but does not camouflage skin tone. It's best for me to apply the tint with fingertips and gently smooth.Wouldn't give up my foundation as it's needed for evenings and special occasions, but for daily use this Tinted Moisturizer really saves a step in the morning and saves my face all day."
4,from a make up beginner's point of view,"I was never into powders or foundation before reason being I bought 3 or 4 of them before (expensive ones) and I had to throw them out because they caused too much caking and I hated that heavy feeling on my face. I like this product because it's easy to put on and it's very light. (use a sponge wedge not your fingers, it's easier to blend). My main problem is reddish skin, sensitive to heat and hot showers, just sensitive in general, otherwise my skin is not bad. I recommend moisterizing and wait until it absorbs, then use the tinted lotion and a powder for the shine. (their loose powders are very sheer and light too). I use nude for the tinted lotion and beige loose powder; I have a fair/light complexion. It's a bit expensive, and if there are other products better than this one...i wouldn't really know. but i really love this product. good luck shopping!"
2,okay,Read great reviews about this product but it just wasn't that great. too watered down for me (older skin). Will not purchase again.
2,doesn't live up to the hype,"I read somewhere that Sarah Jessica Parker says this stuff makes her face ""glow"", yeah, it made me look pasty. And it actually didn't settle into my skin evenly. Not happy with this product at all, but will still use it as sunscreen as it seems to do the job."
4,great product,It was suggested to me for my 13 year old as a nice way to get a touch of coverage with moisturizer. She is very happy with it as it works wonderfully. I just would like it to be a bit more reasonable.
5,62 yr old loves this!,"Granted, I don't look my age, however, this tinted moisturizer is just perfect for me. It's light, evens out my skin tones (even the red on my chin) and has sun block. btw, I use a moisturizer (whatever I have around, samples, whatever) before I apply this (I wait a few minutes between the 2). If you want a natural look when your skin is thinning, this is so wonderful!"
2,not for oily or acne prone skin,"If you have acne prone or oily skin, do not purchase this product. I made me break out. I think it is would be perfect for those with normal to dry skin though."
1,Try it before you buy,"I found this product not as advertised. It's thick, greasy and looks very artificial. Perhaps the oil-free version works better, but this product was like applying paint. I've used foundations in the past but now like tinted moisturizers because they are light, easy to apply and have a very subtle look. This product was like applying grease paint. If you want a thick cover than this is the product you might consider. I bought another product from the same line, the brightening powder and it's o.k., but don't think I would purchase it again. Given my experience with these two products I would probably never buy anything from this line again."
1,WHAT'S ALL THE HOOPLAH ABOUT?????,"I love, love, love Laura Mercier's products, but this one just disappointed.The moiturizer is very heavy and gooey, and does not go on evenly. Since it is tinted, an even application is necessary. The colors are not natural looking, at least the ones I have tried. And it did not make my face feel moisturized.The coverage is also too sheer for me (ok... so I'm a tad bit over 40). So I would need to use foundation anyway.I'm sticking to a non-tinted moisturizer (not by Laura M)."
5,Laura Mercier moisturizer,"I thought that the cost of $15.96 for shipping a miniscule item that weighed ounces and that cost $42.00 was simply ridiculous. Thanks, Vanna Moore"
1,NOT A MOISTURIZER -- This is a FOUNDATION,"I do not wear foundation, but really liked the idea of a tinted moisturizer since I like to wear a moisturizer with SPF every day to protect my skin and wanted just a little color without the caked on feel or look.This may be a fantastic foundation (I'm not really qualified to rate that category), but it is a HORRIBLE moisturizer. I have very normal skin -- doesn't take much moisturizer. The first time I tried this product, I applied it three times and it STILL lacked the moisture I get from my drugstore stand-bys like Oil of Olay.The name of this product is incredibly misleading. I see that most of the positive reviewers here use it as a foundation, which is great, but it should be called a Foundation rather than a Moisturizer. I am returning the product and will continue my search for a good tinted moisturizer."
2,Not for my skin,"I have been using mineral foundation for the last 2 years, and I thought I would try something else after reading tips from a professional makeup artist on About.com. Turns out, I went back to my good old foundation within 10 minutes.This tinted cream provides absolutely no coverage, ZERO. What is leaves behind however is a layer of oil that made my skin shiny and sticky.I rinsed my face, and never looked back."
3,"""Bring me Edelweiss"" - a shining example of disco yodeling","Quite possibly one of the finest disco yodeling albums ever recorded, Edelweiss's maxi-single ""Bring me Edelweiss"" will bring instant nods of recognition from anyone who ever went clubbin' in the late 80's or early 90's. An enchanting combination of the best parts of Abba and the Swiss Miss Cocoa commercials, Edelweiss covers the musical spectrum from A to B. In other words, if you don't remember Rick Astley and Jason Donovan fondly, you probably won't like this novelty dance track. Most of the music on the CD is throwaway dub tracks, but the first two songs are worth listening to and bring back pleasant memories of younger, thinner days. A must for the the discriminating Bananarama remix collector. Everyone else - take a pass."
3,"Blue Wa, Green Sailorter","Although I have been a big fan of Stuart Woods for his ongoing series featuring NY Lawyer, Stone Barrington, his latest Stone Barrington mysteries have become quite predictable. As a voracious reader I am reluctent to pay $10 + for a book I can read in one long session.His adventure as a younger person learning about sailing/boat building and yachting regattas was terrific and out of the ordinary for him."
5,Vivaldi Masterpieces perfectly played,"This CD contain six concertos, three for flute and three for ""flautino"" which is actually a soprano recorder. The Concerto in C major for flautino is not only one of Vivaldi's best but one of the most beatiful concertos ever. The fast movements from each of these concerti must be difficult to play because of the small size of the instruments. The capella Istropolitana and the soloist gives such spritited performances that I am still ""humming"" hours after listening.Please please buy this CD. This performace cannot be bettered.This CD belongs in the collections of not just baroque lovers or Vivaldi lovers but in every classic music lovers home."
5,I can't believe it!,"I found this book entirely readable. I was apprehensive about growing old but now I am enthusiastic about the prospect. In addition, I am now able to care for my ageing mother with skills and techniques I never thought I had! I wish to recommend this book to all those who have elderly parents, friends or relatives - or to anyone who thinks they want to live to sixty! it's a winner - go and buy it now, while stocks last."
1,Ugh,Tastes like a mixture of sea water and old stale coffee grounds. Gave it to a friend and he didn't like it either. Ended up trashing it.
3,Good,Haven't gotten coffee: chicory balance right consistently. Not a fan of too much chicory; may need to find a Cajun expert.
4,Enjoyable book for elementary students.,"I use this book (with many others) as part of my Westward Expansion/Pioneers unit for 3rd graders. It touches nicely on the subject and provides for opportunity to expand (in more detail of course) on the various encounters and experiences by the family along the way while ""going west"". My students enjoy it and always comment positively on it, both text and illustration."
4,Mastering Essential Math Skills,"I have used this book as a skill drill for most of my classes. The falw however, is that if you don't follow the same order in your curriculum, the students get lost in the ""review"" excercises. The addition and multiplication skill drills are a bonus."
5,From the mind of a child,This is an amazing book. i didn't need to use the book for homeschooling or anything but it helped me with my confidence going into sixth grade.Author ofThe Truth abouttCafffeine
5,hard to find,it is hard to find these blades i was lucky i looked here they are good strong blades have used them before.
4,XBOX's Answer to Final Fantasy,"This is a very solid RPG that has a very similar gameplay and feel to Final Fantasy. IT is definitely worth playing for people who enjoy RPG's. One thing I want to make clear -- if you do decide to purchase this game, give it 3 or 4 hours of gameplay before putting it down. It is slow moving at first, but starts to get interesting around the 3-hour marker and gets all the way until the end. So please enjoy."
4,Solid Role-Playing Game,"Fabntastic Game Idea - the videos are impressive. This game has some fans in the USA, and it deserves them. What you do is the good old solid RPG stuff - talk to people, fight bad guys, become part of an epic story, etc.The graphics are up to next gen standards and the play is fast and furious when the fighting starts!Great RPG for the 360 - I hope there's more!"
3,Fun...but...,"While I enjoy a good JRPG game, this is not exactly fitting of the term GOOD. It isn't bad, but lacks in many departments. If you can get through the first few hours you'll enjoy the rest."
3,es okay...,"if you you like Japanese Anime, this is a wonderful game. i played to the end, and was fairly interested in it the whole time. it can get a little monotonous at times. battle after endless battle with pretty much the same creatures. the one saving grace was this avoid encounter capability you could get. finally the game was enjoyable. of course you need to do battle to gain levels enough to defeat the final monsters, but whooaa, enough is enough already. once the game was over, i was little let down. understandably, but i can honeslty say i have never again put it in the Xbox. anyone want to buy it? :^)"
2,Not so Enchanted Arms,"With a unique battle system and a huge plethora of characters to choose from this title seems like it can't miss. However, within the first 5 min of the game you quickly realize that this is ""my first RPG."" the story seems compelling, for about an hour, then the mundane side stories kick in and is only fit for ""filler"" use. the ""twists"" are pretty much non-existant, and I found myself finishing it only because I bought it. All in all, there is little to love, save maybe the collection of the different usable battle characters. If you find yourself in a ""gotta catch 'em all"" kind of month, then by all means pick it up, but I suggest that you wait for a solid RPG to blow in."
1,One of the worst RPG's ever,"Before I even begin my review, let me just say that I've been playing RPG's since 1984, when they were played in text form only. I've played everything from Zork to Bard's Tale to Diablo 2 LOD to Oblivion (all of which are great games)Then I attempted to play Enchanted Arms. I knew within the first 5 minutes that I was not going to like this game. One of the main characters uses a saxaphone as his weapon, ""blasting"" enemies with song notes. The combat system is confusing and unfun. It's as if the people who created this game had never played an RPG before, because it doesn't seem to borrow any of the good attributes of the many great RPG's which have gone before it.The fact that this game comes out on the very advanced XBox 360 system makes it expensive, but believe me when I say that you will quickly regret dropping $50.00 on it. Rent it if you must, but I like RPG's as much or more than just about anybody, and I could barely stand to play it for ten minutes."
1,Homosexual themed RPG,"If you are looking for a homosexual game for you or your child/teenager look no further. I through this game in the trash after playing it no longer than 1/2 hour. Complete garbage. Dont get me wrong Jesus Christ loves the sinner he gave his life for us, but he does hate sin. In Christ~"
2,A Pretty Big Disappointment,"This game seemed like it would be fun, but it is full of extremely boring dialog presented in a boring manner. Call me politically incorrect, but there is a very annoying flaming transvestite character in the game that can't say a single sentence without making it a homosexual one. For example, he mentions how his love for another character is an ingredient in everything that he bakes. And after playing the game for a few hours and listening to his constant mushy remarks made with a horrid lisp, I had to shut the game off and I will be selling my copy to a poor unsuspecting soul who thinks that this game might be as fun as Final Fantasy games. Being a heterosexual, excessive homosexual content just doesn't entertain me the way that it might entertain someone else."
1,I couldn't even finish it,"It is rare that I don't finish a book once I've started it, but The Sacrifice was such an experience. I kept going back to it, trying to give the story a chance, but I was beaten! I could barely find the plot line, it was so hidden in lectures on church history and doctrine and politics. I found the writing style to be condescending, so the book has gone into the donations bin."
4,Good Mystery and Excellent Exposition,"One doesn't really read William Kienzle without expected a little religio-cultural edification. Indeed, I ended up learning more about Romano-Anglican relationships than about the criminal mind. Like another reviewer here, I suspect that the dear Fr. Koesler's appearance in this story was a little tired. Still, I'm hopeful that he might resurrect (as it were) in yet another tale or two.I especially value the author's ability to tell stories about powerful, even holy, institutions with rich characters who suffer the flaws that all mankind have borne: Neither the ""good guys"" nor the ""bad guys"" are stereotypical. There are rich grays in the personalities of our priests, cops and work-a-day Joes and Janes here while the heights to which some of them aspire are supremely lofty, and the depths for which others yearn are dank and noisome indeed."
2,What???,"I can't believe all these positive reviews; I couldn't even finish it, it was so boring. That may be why I didn't like it; maybe it got better in the second half. In essence I wouldn't buy it. (Of course, that's just one person's opinion.)"
4,Text Book,This book is the same book my son uses in school. It is not a book you can just pick and learn unless you are a mathematical wizard.We bought it for him to work with a tutor.It is a high school math book.Works for him.
1,"Good for review, horrible for self-teaching","While this book is excellent for review, it is horrible for trying to learn the material. I suggest buying a different book to learn the concepts and buy this book to practice. The questions are challenging."
3,Colorful but not so comfy,"Not exactly sure what the appeal is with these little chairs. My kids went through the Elmo phase, the Sesame Street phase, then the Disney Princess period, and now they are on Dora. With each phase we ushered in a new plush chair since the last went out with the trash long before the novelty wore off. These plush cushions are foam, so if your toddler spills even one drink on it, you're forced to soak it with soap and water then air dry it since you cannot toss the entire thing in the laundry. Sure the cover comes off for cleaning but it's not that easy to force the foam back perfectly so that the seat actually looks like a chair. To top it all off, after a while the front of the chair slopes downward, making it quite uncomfortable for the little ones to remain in their seats. This is purely pretty to look at and useful for about 30 minutes. I'd skip this is you want a place for your kids to comfortably lounge around."
2,Not that good..,"You will need always special nVidia Drivers, this drivers not always up to date..When you see the demo with the software you will say WOW, but in games your eyes will hurt if you play more than 5 min..Save your money.."
2,"I want to like this, but...","Lubricated Goat made some excellent albums. I would recommend their 'Plays the Devil's Music' 'Paddock of Love' and 'Psychedelicatessen' albums to any fan of noisy grungy rock. This album is a collection of re-recorded tunes from those albums. What you get here is essentially Stu Spasm solo recordings. Unfortunately, these versions just highlight how much he needs his band. Sure, there were always an evolving cast of players in the Goat, but all of those players brought an energy that Spasm could work off of. Alone, we have a slower, more lethargic album that is missing all it's charm. As a fan of the band it is fun to hear different versions, but these versions lack the spark, the fun and the fury of the originals."
5,Great intro to the Goat...,"A pal intrroduced me to Lubricated Goat a while back but it's hard to find their stuff. This Reptilian Records release is a best of, but the solngs have all been rerecorded and sound better than the originals."
3,"Very fun, but be careful","the game is very fun, but, if you don't have a controller then your out of luck. all the tutorials pop ups in the game are for a controller, but if you use a keyboard like me, you have to constantly go back to the manuel.nonetheless, very fun."
1,good luck playing it,"Devil May Cry 3 Special Edition just couldn't hold it. The game display is limited to only 1024 by 768. You will have to hunt down for patches and drivers just to close out the game when you want to. The controller are the worst I've seen so far with limited functions to change. I would not bother to load it in a high end pc, because it will still look bad. Hard controller, weak display, and no exit menu makes this game a frustrating experrience to look over."
2,Nice product; the corn picks were disappointing,"The set looks great! The corn picks were a little too short, which made eating the corn securely tenuous at best. The picks kept coming out of the corn. A little frustrating."
4,Complex and convincing,"Charlie Muffin gets by by not getting noticed. He can't do that when he's roped into solving an ancient World War II mystery--a British and American officer are found dead in the Russian gulag. Worse, someone is trying to keep their story as buried as their bodies were. Author Brian Freemantle does a great job describing modern Russia and also characterizing the office politics that are the bane of Russian, American, and British existance. Could it be, though, that the women were a little stereotyped?"
3,Creepy...but entertaining.,"It's neither here nor there. Kind of creepy in that there's a young girl with sexual thoughts about a much older man. It's sorts of all wrong really, but entertaining nevertheless."
1,The Holy Girl,"This film by director Lucretia Martel hints at many possibilities but in the end falls short and doesn't deliver. The characters play out their roles like mid-day t.v. soap at best. Pity, since the plot showed more promise."
1,A Total Disappointment,"This film was utterly boring - and that is possibly the worst crime in cinema. It was also pointless. We are foreign film enthusiasts, but this was so dull I can barely describe it in simple words. We waited and waited for the plot deepen, and at the very moment when we thought something compelling was developing the film abruptly ended. There was not a single heroic character in the film, and many loose ends running hither and tither that never came to be. Que triste!"
4,"All-in-all, A Nice Starter Set","I purchased this set for my son who was ready to upgrade to 1st class knives. Although the packaging said I was getting a 6"" 'Cook's' knife, what I actually received was an 8"" 'Chef's' knife (and that was fine with me).I had hoped the block would also accommodate the Calphalon (See my review of this bargain.) 6"" meat fork I purchased to go along with the knife set. Unfortunately, the slots are a little too thin to accept the tines. (This was also true of the Henckels knife block, part of my personal set.)The reason I rated the set 4-Stars was that the handles, poly(whatever), did not fit my hand as comfortably as my Henckels 4-Star set. Additionally, they felt quite slick. The knives feel heavy and are well balanced (as well, they should be)."
5,I LOVE Snobol,We have well water and have an awful time with mineral build up. This is the only product that I have found that works for us. My family used it when I was growing up but for some reason no one sells it locally anymore. I was so happy to find it again on Amazon.
4,misleading but good reading,"I judged the book by the cover. I thought it would have more of a religious tone. But since I ordered it, I decided to read it. It turns out to be quite an interesting book. I only wish it was longer. I wasnt too fond of the explicit love scene, but overall, I would recommend it."
4,Entertaining,My husband is a freelance writer and author who avidly reads books by other authors. I came across this book in his study. The title immediately grabbed my attention. I couldn't help wondering if it would be similar to the biblical tale; 'Samson and Delilah'. I was thrilled at how entertaining it was. All characters in the book seem to have purpose.
4,Very well-done for a first,I found it captivating and imagined myself playing the part of Rosalie. Perhaps that will happen in the near future. There is definitely movie potential in this book.
3,Misleading Title,"Rather dissapointing, lots of orchestra, even vocal, to little zither.Even the Harry Lime theme is an orchestra version, just slightly decorated with zither - what is this supposed to have to do with the portrait of Caras?"
2,Didn't work for me,"This was recommended as a supplement to help lose weight - I tried it and saw no difference. It might work for others, but not for me."
4,L-Carnitine,This product came sooner than expected and helps with workouts. I have taken this supplement before but bought it locally for a much higher price. It seems to sustain a longer workout without exhausting muscles too early. It also seems to enhance power. I would definitely purchase this product again.
2,A little too much energy,My trainer suggested I take this supplement and I had some negative side effects. Upset stomach and diarrhea. I highly recommend you talk to a nutritionist or doctor before taking this to review dosage/frequency.
1,pure carnitine?,"I have been successfully using Carnitine or Acetyl Carnitine against muscle cramps and I chose this brand because of the Carnipure label.However, some of the 120 capsules contain small black particles which I interpret as contamination. Therefore I question the qualitity and the pureness of this product."
2,Floating capsules,"The capsules float in the water in my mouth I am using to take them, and are very difficult to swallow without gagging. I had to cancel my subscription, and will look for more solid pills / capsule forms of carnitine."
5,Barb,Good vitamin. Great for energy and pick up without the sugar and caffiene. Helps with weight loss with diet and exersise
3,Oh Well,"If you used to drink Sassafrass tea in the spring, just know that - for your own protection - granny gove has decreed REAL sassafrass hazardous, so this isn't it. The smell is nice, and you can't blame the company for following the law and ""fixing"" it. Won't order this item again, however it was well wrapped and arrived on time, so will order other items from this company - just not adulterated sassafrass."
1,"Boring, condescending, and did I mention boring?","Mr. Hobsbawm's reputation may precede him, but his book is a weak, pretentious, and crushingly dry collection of essays that add just the wrong touch of elitism and snobbery to make the whole thing taste sour. The language, syntax, and sentence structure he uses is excruciatingly abstruse, and one suspects that the style hides the fact that his conclusions are all rather a statement of the obvious. Historiography need not be a dreadful, patronizing experience, so avoid this book at all costs and read the refreshingly provocative ""The Dustbin Of History"" by G. Marcus."
1,Damage products,the item should be pack differently. the front page of the product comes damage. Damage in away that it is melted so that the first page is useless.
5,Awesome,What a great idea for a product. I stick it on one at a time in different places. For example near the changing table my 2 month old infant loves to stare at the face/yellow/red color. It is a great distractor when I am changing him.
1,Poisonous Propaganda for Small Minds,"Here's the type of bombshell you'll find in this sinister, yet ridiculous book. Hufschmid writes with dark sarcasm, ""What a coincidence the terrorists did not hit Rumsfeld's office."" Wow, Hufschmid, that's dynamite stuff! Wouldn't the coincidence be if the plane happened to hit Rumsfeld's office in a building that covers 29 acres? Hufschmid purports to think that a drone, not an American Airlines 757, hit the Pentagon. Why is it, then, that hundreds of drivers on the 14-lane highway next to the Pentagon saw an American Airlines 757 and not a single witness saw a drone?See:http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/blflight77w.htmhttp://www.snopes.com/rumors/pentagon.htm"
1,Silly book,"Hufschmid's idea that the WTC and Building 7 were demolished with explosives that were placed in the buildings in preparation for the 9-11 attack is absurd.Yes, there are a lot of unanswered questions, but the idea that hundreds of people got together to put explosives in the WTC and Blgd. 7 months before the attack is ludicrous.I exchanged email with Hufschmid in December 2004 and when I started asking the Painful Question, he said he had no more time to communicate with me.Hufschmid has an interesting thesis, but it does not hold weight."
5,Exposes the 9/11 Truth and 9/11 Lies,"&#65279;Erics book does an excellent job of illustratingthe evidence available in 2002 proving that the attack on 9/11 was a scam, a fake terrorist attack.A cruel hoax committed by rouge elements of our own government and others seeking to profit from war and oil.It's a starting point for bringing the real terrorists to justice. A Nuremberg type trial is on thehorizon for the murderous filth who did this crime of the century."
1,"Hufschmid misses boat, falls in river of blather","Have you ever been in a classroom where someone breaks the ""no question is too stupid"" rules, and really does ask a stupid question? Well, that's all Eric does in this book. OK, he might have one good question (that anybody can GUESS the answer, by the way), but he then veers off onto waves of unrelated tangents. Eric rants by asking questions that either have already been answered, or never will be because it is simply too expensive to do the kind of engineering analysis his questions demand, or nobody cares because they are so off the wall.The book does have many excellent 9/11 pictures."
3,okay for the price,"The shirt, which was supposed to be 100% cotton according to the tag, is not as soft as I imagined, but for the price I guess I can't complain."
5,Third year in a row... and counting,"This is the third year in a row I shop this Tee for my everyday use, to dress under long sleeve shirts I use to work 10-13 hours a day, and I have no regrets at all. They are fresh and comfortable. If you are looking for a good cost-benefit tee, look no more.Highly recommended."
2,Nice,This is the only Haynes T-shirt that does not bunch at the back of the neck. It is light and drapes well. But it is too light for printing.
5,great fit,"These t shirts fit great on my bf, he loves them and they make him look good at work under his work shirt"
1,bought 2- don't do it,"after about 6 wears of these t-shirts (worn under dress shirt0, both collars started to fray w/ cotton ballsnot a good deal, unless that's the look you want"
3,Same as Fruit of the Loom.,A 6X Shirt has a funny way of turning into an XL after 2 washings. I wasn't that impressed with the quality.
2,service,when I received these shirts they ask that instead of giving them a poor review to contact them. So I did and it was ignored.They never bothered getting back to me. Also these shirts fade pretty quick for a 50/50 blend
2,Not the right color...,"The shirt looks comfy, but it is not ""teal"" as it says int he description. I am pretty disappointed, actually."
3,"Comfortable, but shrunk considerably after first wash","While the shirt is high-quality and comfortable, it shrunk considerably after I washed it the first time. While I do recommend it, any buyer should strongly consider getting one size larger than they actually are."
1,Don't Buy From LEAD Apparel,As a rule of thumb to all buyers who haven't ran into any trouble with LEAD Apparel don't buy an item from this company. I never received my order and then when I complained they gave me the runaround excuse that I received my item. Luckily I was refunded my money through Amazon and I won't spend another cent with LEAD again.
3,soft and thick but...,"Shirts are very soft and thick, but after the first washing they shrank so much that they went from a small men's shirt that looked large to a small woman's sized shirt! I wear small men's and these came out too small."
1,This is not 100% cotton as in the title.,"I ordered the white color. This is only 50% cotton, so I had to throw it away (I hated the touch).Now I do see that in the description there is a note about it (50%), but since the title states clearly 100% cotton then this is very misleading and I feel I was cheated."
2,They should size these shirts better,I believe they should adjust the sizing for these shirts. I ordered my true size but would probably need to order one or two sizes bigger. It was so tight I'm afraid to wash it.
3,"Price/Quality is OK, but Quality is too low","Yes, this t-shirt is cheap, and I was buying it as such. However, it had appeared to be crappier than I expected. The material it is made of is too coarse. In addition, it considerably shrinks after the first wash. On the other hand, it is unexpectedly well made -- all the seams are straight."
3,hanes,"pros: good material, good length, received on time.cons: neck is too wide. hanes needs to make the neck smaller. then it will be a perfect fit"
4,Great T,Not much to say...it's a plain white t-shirt. The ComfortBlend makes this shirt very comfortable. It is also thick enough to wear either by itself or as an undershirt. No complaints.
1,The color runs in the wash,"I bought one each of the deep red and deep royal colors.I hand washed them, fortunately separately, before wearing and both colors ran, and are still running despite numerous rinses."
2,Fair T-shirts,"I received these T-shirts roughly two years ago, and have since replaced them. First thing that I noticed is that they are very irregularly sized amongst themselves. The cotton is rigid, and not as soft as what you can get for the same price elsewhere. The fit around the shoulders is small and awkward. Though these shirts are tagless, hanes produces other kinds of shirts in a tagged variety. That they don't combine these things seems a bit contrived to me. Overall, I still have two of them as work shirts, and they probably would have lasted longer if I could have dealt with the awkward fit."
1,Not what you think,These shirts are not really what you think if you are looking for something to lounge around in or work out in they are more form fitting. Disappointed due when someone buys in 4XL or larger they are looking for comfort and room to move in not to be so skin tight barely get them on or fight to pull them off. Very tight in the arms and pits not a good fit hard to move your arms. Nothing personal against the company sold them it is just Hanes brand themselves. I find they tend not to be consistent on their product manufacturing.
3,Not the best,"If you're looking a for good heavy-weight T-shirt for the gym or the just to wear around, I prefer the 6.1 oz. over this 5.5 oz. shirt. Go the heavier route, you'll be glad you did!"
4,Hanes Tagless Tee,"This is a very good product, very strong. the quality is O.K. also It lasts longer than those other Tees i had before. Nice"
1,very disappointed,I also ordered the DVD thinking I was getting the one starring Kirk Douglas and Henry Fonda. That's what was on the case and that's what was advertised by Amazon.com. It is not what I got at all. I got some black and white movie with the same title but starring Robert Sterling. I am in the process of returning it in hopes of getting the movie I ordered or a full refund. We'll see.
5,Irresistable,Blood and Fire by John Marquis is an excellent read. I found I couldn't put the book down after I started it. The mix of murder and royalty is irresistable.
4,COMPELLING,"Well-written and compelling. Marquis captures the mood of early Nassau and marshals his facts well as he re-tells the story of the murder of the century. Marquis offers disturbing insights into the murder of Sir Harry Oakes, fearlessly exploring the unusual response of the Duke of Windsor, then Governor of the Bahamas, and the other key players. I did not want to put this book down."
3,A fair wrap,"Those looking for an answer will be disappointed. While a new avenue of enquiry is presented as a teaser, restrained by a journalistic confidence, no new evidence is presented. Some may find the author's strong opinions distracting, but what he does is present a good wrap of all the known theories surrounding the murder. Most accounts concentrate solely on the period of the crime, but this one includes a useful history of subsequent related activities in the Bahamas. A section of photographs is marred by questionable selection and poor reproduction."
5,Suspenseful murder mystery that will keep you wanting more!!!,I received this book as a Christmas present and could not put it down. It is an excellent read and i highly recommend it. You won't be disappointed.
2,The last big Bahama scandal before Anna Nicole,"This book is an account of the sensational murder of North American millionaire Harry Oakes in 1943, and the subsequent framing, trial, and acquittal of his son-in-law. I thought this would be a fascinating book, but the author has a weak, erratic style, and I found it all frustrating and long-winded. Even the author's theories of the true perpetrator were a bit vague. The book does give insights into Nassau's old servile colonial character, now happily long gone, and tantalizes with well-founded suspicions about the Governor of the Bahamas -- the Duke of Windsor -- a truly outrageously misguided and weak individual."
3,Murder in the Bahamas,"Another retelling of the famous Sir Harry Oakes murder that promises the ultimate answer as to WHO killed the millionaire but DOESN'T. The author, Mr. Marquis failed his readers with broken promises."
1,Not again,More rubbish masquerading as mystery novel. The only mystery here is why a publisher would waste paper on this superficial and amateurish effort.What was the point of this book?
4,Natural meditation and fun lyrics,"There are some fun and expressive poems and lyrics here. Perhaps the ones I enjoyed best are the nature meditations, as ""When the bee lands the morning glory bloom dips some and weaves"". Some have the feel if not the rules of haiku. There are also more playful and bawdy poems here as in ""Their sex life: One failure on Top of another"" or ""Coward: Bravery runs in my family"". Others such as Chasm or Cleavage use the arrangement of the words on the page to complement the poetry. If you're not up for Ammon's book-length poems (e.g. Sphere or Garbage), this provides a good introduction."
2,Meandering and Pointless,"I usually enjoy French crime movies, but this supposedly great film by Godard is meandering and pointless. The plot is almost non-existent, as it appears to be filmed for self-indulgent reasons in a whimsical manner, allowing the story to unfold in a random manner. There is not enough content to justify the running time of the film; maybe if it was edited down to a one-hour television special, all the filler could be removed and the movie would dare to be entertaining, instead of a waste of time."
2,Wonderful In All Ways But One.,"This is my fifth F-Series mousepad. I love the size, surface texture, thinness, even the price is okay. But I have four of the five sitting in a cabinet because the bottom area separated from the top area, and it ALWAYS starts with the corner where the round Orange Ball with an F goes through it. Wait, sorry, my wife said she threw away the box I had with three of them. Only one broken one left. I was hoping someday I could find out where/how to return them. I'll keep buying them though and I suppose that makes me a sucker.. I just love the way they feel and work. I just wish they'd last longer than a few months. My newest one, the one I'm writing this review for? It's about two weeks old and separating already."
4,Wonderful source of Information for Natural Birthing!,"This book gives a nice glimpse into Dr.Bradley's background and philosophies, regarding natural birth. Dr.Bradley was certainly a pioneer in helping women to regain their strength regarding natural birthing. If a Bradley Birth is your goal, I would certainly recommend reading a variety of books on the topic, particularlyNatural Childbirth the Bradley Way: Revised Edition. It gives a thorough preparation for giving birth ."
5,must have baby book,If you're having a baby this book is the Bible of baby books. Everything you want in birth is here and is the healthiest way to give birth safely and with a healthy child.
4,Dr. Bradley's Method,"Well, it's true, the tone of this book is sexist and dated. HOWEVER- Bradley's method is well worth learning about. This book is worthwhile, but for a more updated and balanced approach to the same material, check out ""Natural Childbirth the Bradley Way"" by Susan McCutcheon-Rosegg"
2,"very boring and drawn out book, however the method is great",the method and thought behind this is great however the book is sooooo difficult to read. it's lengthy and just wordy.
3,Worth reading,"This book is definately worth reading if you're interested in drug-free childbirth. However, the part about the evils of inducing labor became very incredible when I got to the part about the patient of Dr. Bradley whose pregnancy supposedly lasted 11 months! So now I'm taking Dr. Bradley's advice with a grain of salt!"
4,Amusing,"Dr. Bradley is a narcissist. He thinks he's hilarious. There are so many cheesy lines in this book, its worth it just for giggles. At the same time, I liked reading it for the perspective he offers of what a natural childbirth can be like. True, some arguments in the book are outdated, but that just makes me grateful for the women who have gone before to make it that way.Summary: A little bit of history, some funny stories, and some good ideas for a natural childbirth."
1,SO DISGUSTED!!,"I have NEVER been so disgusted by a book in my life. ""husband coached childbirth""?? Really its more like ""husband controlled pregnancy"" and has little NOTHING to do with childbirth! It barely even mentions the subject! And to make matters worse, it refers to the woman as an ANIMAL on every page. It's extremely revolting. The author and especially the editor who allowed it to be given such a false name should be beyond ashamed of themselves. This garbage is getting sent back, I don't care how cheap it was, because I won't have it in my house to be an embarrassment! Disgusting."
4,Great for Husbands that will read it!,"I purchased this for my husband to assist me in the birth of our fifth child naturally. He has not read any of it. I have read several chapters skipping through to get to te guts of the book and have found vry informative things for husbands to know and realize (sure wished mine would). The arthur throws in some funny exerpts often to keep you alert and thinking logically. I recommend this to and for participating husbands, as it will help answer many questions and take the nervousness away."
4,Very helpful,"I thought the book was very informative and helpful on what to expect with labor. I just wish the book had a larger chapter on relaxation techniques. My husbnad and I do feel more prepared and confident about the birth of our baby. We wanted to go natural and this is our first child. This is definitely a book worth buying if you want to learn more about going natural. Reading the testimonials from other families was great, because everyone is different and you really don't know what will work for you until you get to that point. This book is a must."
2,Don't buy this as substitute for classes.,We bought this book because we did not learn about the Bradley method till I was 6 months pregnant and couldn't find a session that had openings and finished before the due date. We knew a lot about the method and were very interested in using it in the birth of our first baby. We expected that the book would give us more information on the principles of the Bradley method than it did. The book's basic motiv is just to convince you that nonmedicated natural childbirth is the best way. We already knew that; we just wanted some literature beyond lamaze to show us how to manage the pain more effectively. Don't waste the money on the book; try to sign up for the classes.
4,Wonderful birth method and book,"I love the Bradley method. I actually became a Bradley birth instructor in 2008 and I leaned a great deal from the techniques used. As for this particular book, it is really about how the Bradley method was established rather than the techniques involved in method. If you are looking for something to teach you about the techniques, I would recommend Natural Childbirth the Bradley Way by Susan McCutcheon-Rosegg. I love to learn the reasons behind why people do things the way they do them and how they happened upon that discovery, so I did enjoy this book. It does tend to be a bit repetitive, which i have heard several people complain about, but it didn't bother me. Good book, good method!"
3,For beginners,"I did not read this, my husband did. He found it very basic and elementary, written for men who have no background or exposure to pregnancy or pregnant women and childbirth. That has it's place for many readers but my husband found this approach to be taxing to read. He did persevere, however, because every 5-6 pages he said he would read a ""golden nugget"" of useful information which he did not want to miss out on. Also, it was required reading for our Bradley class."
3,Good book but not amazing,"Its an informative book, but I ended up buying ""natural childbirth the bradley way"" which is a more realistic and modern approach. I learnt a lot from this book but like other reviews have stated it has a lot of anecdotes and after reading several chapters I felt like it was just going round in circles. There is a lot to learn from Robert Bradley but his style of writing leaves a bit to be desired. Nevertheless its still a good read for moms interested in natural birth."
1,arrogant and fairly useless,"Unfortunately he doesn't go into detail on the Bradley method, rather focuses on how great his method is and how horrible other methods are. It may be a great way to give birth but there isn't enough info in this book to tell."
4,An Excellent Introduction to the Bradley Method,"This was Dr. Bradley's original work on natural childbirth. This visionary OB helped women to reclaim the natural, joyous method of birthing for which their bodies had been designed. I read it and immediately sought out a Bradley instructor to learn the method. My daughter was subsequently born after a short, relatively painless labor (hard work, but no ""pain""), with dad coaching. :)I found it less helpful in describing the mechanics of the birth (for that, see ""Natural Childbirth the Bradley Way""), but it was a very good overview and one which I recommend for folks who have heard of Bradley but are unfamiliar with the method."
2,There are better books for natural childbirth!,"My husband and I read this book, among others, as part of a Bradley natural childbirth class. I have to agree with previous reviews that I found the information to be dated- particularly the hospital horrors he describes are simply no longer existant in our community. And his take on painless childbirth didn't work for us. I did go completely natural, it did hurt, but I don't regret it and will do the same for the next one. I was a little put off by the way he makes it sounds like he invented the idea of drug-free childbirth. There are other books that I felt better informed me of what to expect and what choices I would need to make- ""The Birth Partner"", ""Natural Childbirth the Bradley Way"", ""Active Birth : The New Approach to Giving Birth Naturally"", or ""Good Birth, Safe Birth"". Good luck to all of you wanting to go natural- it's a beautiful experience!"
3,"Interesting perspective, not sure how much based on evidence","Very inspiring book, particularly if you are looking for alternatives to a manipulative hospital birth. I found some passages slightly dogmatic, but still fairly authoritative. The assumption that humans give birth as easily as other mammals if left to their own devices, an assumption central to the book's argument, sounds outdated. We know that the evolutionary modification of our spine, pelvis, and the baby's head, did lead to more difficult births. I also did not like the occasional religious vocabulary. But overall it is a very encouraging book."
3,Helpful...,"This book is helpful for the first time parent, both mother and father, to understand what to expect during child birth, and how to best support her during this time. I would recommend this."
1,Completly Useless,"A waste of money if you want to learn the basics of the Bradley Method without having to become an expert on everyone else's techniques. Also, a difficult book to read even if you understand the concepts involved. Skip this book and move on to Childbirth the Natural Way."
4,Anticipation...,"...is Carly Simon's second solo effort and she sounds great and the songs are interesting and good. One of my fave early Carly albums as I prefer her folkiness to pop.Songs to download: Summer's Coming Around, The Girl You Think You See, Legend in Your Own Time, Anticipation"
4,Rummy-Tummy Good,"With so few books solely on rum in exsistance, this wonderful book will never lose its potency. It doesn't give much history, focusing on fabulous recipes from all over the globe -- the way it should be. If you enjoy rum, you must add this to your collection. Bergeron was long considered the American authority of rum -- this book is proof he was."
2,What do you get the album for?,"The reviews I've read here are mostly complaining on how it doesn't compare to Queen. People be smart, give your money to charity. At least that's a more rewarding expend of it. I guess it serves the artists who want to pay tribute to the ones that inspired them and influenced them just to hear a bunch of people who can't perform half of what these artists do complain about it. If you don't like it go ahead and do it yourself. All I've heard about this record is Somebody to Love. First thing I thought was, What is the date of this? 2001..No wonder why Geoff performance is so lame here as he was struggling with a smoking habit. Is actually very good if you compare it with what he did with Queensryche by that period. Had he sung it by the 1990s another story would had been sung."
1,Boring.....,"With all this talent, this album could/should have been a lot better.""Stone Cold Crazy"" and ""Play the Game"" are just too close to the originals, only the originals were better. ""Fat Bottom Girls"" isn't bad, but I think Antigone Rising do a better version. ""somebody to Love"" one of my personal favs, is laughable. And speaking of laughable, why am I listening to the Nelson Bros.sing ""Crazy Little Thing Called Love?""""Fight from the Inside"" is the only song that really kicks it right. A very good version here w/ Tonys Levin and Thompson as a rythym section. Jason Scheff singing ""Your'e My Best Friend"" is awesome too. It's like he wrote tthe song. Kuddos!! ""I'm in love with my Car"" is no big deal and Glen Hughes' ""Killer Queen"" is back to laughable.""Spread your Wings"" and ""We Will Rock You"" almost end on a good note but all in all the album falls way short. Too bad too, because there's some really great players on this project."
2,Slim Jim a Slim Value,"Step away from this book ... it looks like great fun, doesn't it, but this is a relatively unexciting tale of a boy's slow acceptance of his uncle, and is not as comic as its title (or cover art) suggests.I'm not familiar with Woodruff's other work (she seems prolific enough) so can't recommend an alternative from her oeuvre. Nonetheless, there are too many great books out there to really spend your time on this one.Note: a 3 star ranking from me is actually pretty good; I reserve 4 stars for tremendously good works, and 5 only for the rare few that are or ought to be classic; unfortunately most books published are 2 or less."
1,Wrong item,I am really not in a position to rate the product since it was the wrong fragrance I received and that I hated. It was the Lyme fragrance and I got rid of it. Sorry.
2,Not like I remembered in Bermuda,It didn't smell the way I remembered it in Bermuda. I later sampled it again in a fragrance outlet and it didn't smell good to me either.
4,Very good,this item is very good its cover is firm and it is full of feather. I recommend it for those who like to sleep on high pillows.
2,Extra Firm? Not!,"I expect more from Pacific Coast. This is as Extra Firm as a limp dishrag. Even out of the package, the ""firm"" feel just isn't there. To see if my head could detect what my hands couldn't, I placed it on the bed for a try-out. Nope, my head sunk immediately into the mattress. Not recommended at all!"
5,real heavy metal!,"i love rata blanca, they are from argentina! if you like ozzy and clasic metal you will love this ,spanish lyrics and real metal music ,the guitar player walter giardino is one of the best i ever heard,in their next album entre el cielo y el infierno they change the vocalist and change their style to a similar sound of judas priest"
4,The greatest Argentinian band,"""El libro oculto"" is Rata's fourth record and it starts a new era in the band. No more Purple or Rainbow influences, but a more heavy sound like Accept or Judas Priest. Guitar player Walter Giardino (one of the most talented in the world)leaves his ego behind and let the band write most of the songs. The sound is great (specially in ""Agord, la bruja"" or ""Basura"") and the album shows a mature and powerful heavy metal band. The new Rata Blanca sound would be shown in their next album ""Entre el cielo y el infierno"" with a new line up."
5,PACQUIN PLUS FOR DRY SKIN CREAM,"This is by far the best on the market for dryskin that I have ever used. It is very hard to find in local area drugstores; so I am very happy to be able to purchase the product on line and have it shipped so quickly to me. For those individuals that suffer from dryskin whether you drink gallons of water or not, Pacquin nourishes your skin and leaves it feeling so moist all through the day. Its' texture is creamy and not oily; when applying to the skin it is smooth. The best product I know and I have tried quite a few for dryskin. Pacquin just tops them all."
4,Distinguished Accounts of Both Works,"This is another of the many Naxos' disks that are cheap in price only. Here we have distinguished performances from all involved, especially Jeno Jando, who has completed traversals of the Haydn and Beethoven sonata cycles for Naxos, as well as recorded the lion's share of other projects (such as Liszt's complete piano music) for the label. His work at the keyboard is beyond reproach: assured, dynamic, emotive. The strings give a good account of themselves as well, and all are captured in a fine, slightly recessed but very truthful recording. Not a stellar performance, perhaps, but one that is highly competitive, especially at Naxos' price."
5,Wonderful as Usual,"Nancy Wilson continues to sing wonderfully to this day, but these songs from her earlier years are particularly wonderful. There are 71 titles, but my personal favorite is her wonderful version of ""Ten Good Years."" (Am I over-using the word wonderful?) Her vocal range is amazing, her sense of timing impeccable, her wit with a lyric is utterly charming and besides the cover picture is beautiful. What's not to like?"
4,Magnifique critique du XVIIIe siècle franais.,"La société franaise critiquée par Montesquieu par l'intermédiaire de deux persans en voyage à Paris, qui s'étonnent de ce qu'ils y voient dans des lettres qu'ils envoient à leurs amis et femmes... Habile manière pour critiquer son siècle sans tre ennuyé par la politique du Roi... Montesquieu brosse un tableau amusant et satirique du XVIIIe siècle, entrecoupé de lettres des femmes des persans ou des eunuques chargés de les garder pour le moins désopilentes."
5,chemistry book,Book was in excellent condition. Came exactly has described. Arrived to me super fast!
5,Awesome series,"I can't play basketball worth crap, I always wanted to be able play with some kind of skill. These videos teach all of the fundamentals. Just by watching the videos I was already twice as good as I was. That's not saying much, but I'm not going to play in the NBA either. Then when I actually practice I really feel like I'm more competent on the court. My only problem now is my fat a$$."
3,More efficient use of energy from 1961!,This challenging book deals with some of the ways in which men look to science to provide additional resources in a world that is becoming more and more crowded. It is written to encourage searching thought by today's young people on one of the most urgent and complex problems facing our world..
2,15 minutes = inviting injury,"I've practiced yoga for 13 years, and with a toddler at home I decided to try the 15-minute practice - I have always liked Rodney Yee's videos.I started off with the ""Total Body"" workout, and wound up pulling the muscles of my left shoulder/neck less than 10 minutes in, during the spinal rolls. Five days later still hurts. I should have known with all my yoga experience that spinal rolls so early in a practice is a really bad idea.""15 minutes results"" might sound like a miracle because it is. If you choose to buy this video, please note that you should do at least 10 minutes (5 - 8 sun salutations and some gentle stretching) of warming up beforehand."
4,Friendly and Non-Intimidating Rodney Yee Yoga Training,"The quality is fine. The training is excellent, as always. I think I just prefer for him to work solo. Others may find the exercise less threatening and more user-friendly when he has a yoga partner.It also may be that I was bored with this one because I've advanced further and need to stop buying yoga for beginners! I just have a habit of buying anything Rodney Yee puts together. I'm rarely disappointed and this one is okay, especially for those who are fairly new to yoga and are a little intimidated by starting yoga practice. It's friendly and pleasant."
2,not for beginners,"This video is fast paced and does not give instructions for methods or form. If you are a beginner I think you could harm yourself. If you are advanced, you probably don't need it,"
4,Check-Mate!,"A great little book that everyone should read tongue in cheek. Ireland needs storytelling that can break a way out from under the influence of McGahern and Trevor, two towering influences. Fitzpatrick is erudite and witty, yet her stories retain an almost mythical quality."
2,Well-written but not that amusing,"Maybe I was expecting something different from the cover copy, and from the few pages I read before buying this book. However, while it shows superb writing skill and a wonderful use of words, I found the stories a little too cynical and depressing for my liking. I did laugh out loud now & then... but not enough, and that's what I'd bought the book for.If you're looking for fine Irish literature, this is probably a good choice. If you also want a lot of laugh-out-loud humor, you might want to look at other titles."
4,Only Four Stars?,"I believe this book, like many others, fails to adequetly cover all aspect of & types of searches most people are trying to solve. Eventho the auther covered some of the very basic Of places a person may look, She failed to explain how & where or the tecniques that one would to trace & find a female ancester gone many years.It lacks a show of true knowelege & expertise. If i were grading this as a high school project I would grade it as a D for Content, C for effort & overall would have been returned as I for Incomplete.The dealer was very fast & more than met m expectatitions. Th book was as advertised & in excellent condition. Dealer gets Five Stars !Author gets One Star !! And an I for Incomplete works !!!"
3,Funny but Immoral as Hell,"I read this book some time ago, possibly 1988. This is the book that inspired me on my mastubatory kick as a young man. This is raw language at it's most digusting and graphic of a teenager struggling with his sexuality and that of others. Very strange to say the least. The stories, told in episodic manner, reflect the darkness of the American writer as of the last thirty years, without any of the elequonce of the greater ones. It's quite a horror show but one that must be read. Not for the kiddies or the faint of heart!"
4,chi2tan65,"I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly the hydrocollator was delivered. When I first opened the product, it was smaller than I envisioned... but I supposed if I looked at the actual measurement, I should have known. That being said, directions were simple to follow. Setup took no time at all. The product works very very well. It has been used so many times for tired and achy muscles at my household for many people. It takes about 5 minutes to settle into your muscles and gets HOT very quickly. Just make sure you have enough towels wrapped around the packs else you can burn yourself easily.By far the most effective heat pack treatment I've ever used. Spendy, but worth the money for sore muscles.I rated 4-start simply because of the cost."
5,Excellent,"I have used this product for a couple of years now. Both my Labs are older (11 and 9) and I have used every joint formula on the market. They respond to this one the best. It has the probiotics and other good ingredients for them in here as well. They seem healthier when I give them thi, which is twice daily. When you have older dogs, you want them to be as mobile and healthy as possible. I like the fact that I can make this into a gravy on their food and its not a pill. I feel like they are absorbing more that way. I love the 20 pound container, only buy it once a blue moon. And my dogs love it on their food. I once tried to stop using it, and my lab wouldn't eat her food without it on there. Now that is product endorsement!"
5,senior dogs' salvation!,Regular customer. The 'guardian' and 'caretaker' of 3 senior(13y.o. and up) pups. If it wasn't for the NUPRO JOINT SUPPLEMENT (and some other supplements) my pups wouldn't be as agile and as active as pups. Great product and great seller. Always fast and efficient.
5,Lucy Loves it!,"Our golden retriever Lucy came home from the breeder with NuPro. NuPro what? Quickly found out what a fine product it is. At 9 years old Lucy has the most magnificent coat, no hip problems and two minor skin irritations that were quickly attended to. Good track record......... The stuff looks like grit and when water is added itlooks like mud but she loves it! I buy the 20 lb. bucket which lasts over a year. Many times the local pet emporiums don't have the 20 lbs. bucket or the joint support nupro so lets hear it for one click Amazon."
3,Not the best...,"The acting was not that great and the story was thrown together. I don't understand why the writers can't just try to script it from the book. It was just too far out there. In opinion, this is a terrible sequel to The Christmas Shoes."
3,Good message,"I am giving ""The Christmas Blessing"" only three stars, because personally I found it to be a little boring. It took me about 1/2 to 2/3 into the movie before I could get interested in the story. I also thought the acting seemed too scripted at times. I, however, did appreciate the message of the movie, which was to embrace life, and not let the past rule your future. Charlie from the ""Christmas Shoes"" is all grown up, but the death of his mother, and a fear he has had since 10 years old of losing his dad is keeping him stuck in the past. Throughout the movie, Charlie learns to let go of his fears and his past."
1,Disappointed,I was very disappointed with this movie. If I could have given it no stars I would have. I really loved The Christmas Shoes. That was a well done and touching movie. I can only agree with all the other negative reviews on here 100% about the story line etc. It was just not a well done movie at all.
4,"A Blessing to watch, part two of the Christmas Shoes","I have been a collector, of holiday movies for YEARS and Years. And this is one of the best. Please watch or purchse the Christmas Shoes first since this is part two. You won't be lost since they give FLASH backs to the first movie. But You will enjoy both and this one is a wonderful part two. I can't wait for the part 3."
2,COULDN'T COMPARE WITH THE CHRISTMAS SHOES,"I was sadly disappointed with this dvd. It was a waste of money and time. You cannot compare this with ""TheChristmas Shoes""."
3,Good theme,"This film shows the experience of many that have lost loved ones during the holidays. There are several plots going on. One of them is the breakdown of a marriage. I would have liked this film better if Mr. Lowe had put more into it. He seems to have very little emotion and even his expressions have little variation. The other actors do a very good job, especially the little boy who is very good. He was very well directed and gave an outstanding performance in a role very difficult for anyone, and more so for someone so young."
4,Sad and wonderful at the same time.,"I love Christmas movies and while this one makes me cry, there's an underlying beauty to the movie. Rob Lowe does a phenomenal job in this movie. Much better than I expected."
4,The Christmas Blessing,This was one of the better Christmas movies I have seen. Good storyline. I also would recommend the Christmas Shoes.
1,The Christmas Blessing,Video did not work. It only played for first five minutes.Quality is very bad since the dvd was scratched and damage.
4,"If you want to be touched AND depressed, watch this movie!","Based on a country music song, this story shows the parallel journeys of a workaholic husband who has lost touch with his family and a young boy's struggle to buy one last Christmas gift for his dying mother.I cannot watch this without getting choked up. Definitely not the usual, upbeat Christmas movie but a must see!"
4,Christmas Blessing DVD,I love my recent purchase of THE CHRISTMAS BLESSING. For some reason it won't play on my DVD player but it works on my computer so it isn't the fault of the dvd itself. I still watch it and love it.. it is the sequel to THE CHRISTMAS SHOES which has been a favorite of mine for years.
2,defective,"when i got this board, it turns out that it was defective so i cant really say too much about it, the board wouldn't post like it had no power, and the psu was verified as working."
4,The great Balthus in his own words,"When it comes to twentieth century painters, Balthus is one of the most important and certainly one that stands out from the rest. He is enigmatic and people often misunderstand his paintings. Vanished Splendors is Balthus' memoirs that he was working on at the time of his death. In it he puts forth his philosophy on many subjects such as art, modern art, life, religion, family, love and history. He's known or met most of the important artisians of the last century. Picasso, Camus, Artaud, Monet and more. This is a quick read and gives insight into his world and how he painted (he often took years to finish one canvas). Very enjoyable and informative."
3,Vaporous,"I like the short vignettes/chapters in the book, they make for easy reading and give the opportunity to set the book down often and contemplate what you have just read. He repeats a lot of his experiences which help reinforce the important events of his life. I do have some discord over his rationale for depicting adolescent girls in the nude and compromising positions and find his reasons vaporous. I was disappointed in the lack of illustrations of his paintings although the illustrations of his studio were enlightening. This book definitely helps us understand this mysterious painter."
2,Lost ?,"I`m sure the guys in Elegy tried very hard on this CD to produce something mentionable, but I`m sorry to report that in my own opinion it fails to do so."
3,Music sounds like it's being played on a gramophone.,"I ordered this cd because I am writing a novel set in 1923 and wanted to hear what music at that time sounded like. It is true to its heritage; it sounds as if it were being played in 1923, which is authentic, but disappointing at the same time. I would have enjoyed the cd more had the music been remixed or re-recorded. Still, I am hearing what my characters heard, so the cd is invaluable in that regard."
4,Finally a solution one can live with.,A common sensed approach to healthy living/eating that can assist in erasing the marks of chronic illness. It worked for me in less than 2 months.
5,Conventional Vs. Non-Conventional,"I was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis 5 months ago. My neurologist gave me information on three medications to choose from. A friend of mine gave me the book, ""The Gold Coast Cure."" This book gave me:1. Hope.2. It made common sense nutritionally.3. An alternative to consider before first jumping into medication.Knowing that one of the authors is a medical doctor empowered me to pursue nutrition and to know that medication is always an option. I don't believe the choice is conventional ""or"" non-conventional methods. Rather it is the ""genius of the and"",meaning I can choose nutrition ""and"" I can choose medication if it is needed.The Gold Coast Cure is a sound well balanced book. It's not just about a disease but a knowledgeable resource on nutrition. I believe it is a must read for anyone."
3,On time...but missing CD :(,The book came on time and was in decent shape. But the workout CD is not in the book anywhere... :(
4,Very helpful.Not impossible.,"The Gold Coast cure diet is an easy diet to follow. The book is well written. It does not use ""over my head"" terminologies. My husband and I have found that grocery stores are trying to provide more healthy choices these days which makes this easier to follow. It makes you feel good to know that what you are putting in you body is good for you. After all ""you are what you eat""."
3,Good Info but False Representation of the Low-Carb WOE,"This book contains some very helpful information, such as the dangers of trans fats. I'm a little confused on whether or not Splenda is bad for our bodies. There is conflicting information about that. A lot of what is presented in this book can be found elsewhere, though. However, this book does misrepresent the low-carb way of eating. It is NOT deficient in nutrients as the majority of carbs come from fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. What's missing are refined flours and sugars and trans fats - which this book discourages."
4,Good way in.,"Excellent introduction to French poets, but would have been improved by inclusion of translations for poems cited, for convenience of those who don't know French."
1,"Caveat Emptor: Made in China, Not Italy","The product description for these slippers states ""Made in Italy"". But the slippers are stamped with (you guessed it) ""Made in China"". To add insult to injury, the stain used for the outer part of the slipper apparently did not set or too much was applied. There was a wet spot where stain was coming off on my hands when I touched it.I will not be buying from Casual Male again. Footwear from Italy has a good reputation. Using that reputation to sell inferior quality goods that may have been manufactured in near-slavery conditions is a deplorable act of deception. If it is in fact a mistake of some kind, it's a very, very convenient one."
5,Academic Must-Have for all Students of Tarot!,Important work in understanding how closely astrology is woven into the mystery teachings behind the Tarot symbols.
1,unhappy,"I purchased this camera for my grandson for a Christmas gift. After asking him how he liked it, he stated that the image on the camera is very dark and difficult to see. I am going to send it back and try to get him another camera of better quality"
1,JVC Everio CU-VD20 = piece of junk!,"Bought this item along with new Video Camera about 2 years ago (2007). I have burned several home videos of various events on to 12 different DVD's over this 2 year period of time. Just recently when I went to burn some video onto DVD again, I started encountering the ""disc not recognized"" type errors. I know there's nothing wrong with the disc's as they are all from the same spindle. But, I tried a different disc... same thing.Very disappointed in the reliability of this product. I will say that it worked just fine, when it worked, but this is inexcusable. A product should last longer than 2 years, especially when you spend $200+ for it. Lesson learned, and I won't be buying any other JVC products in the near future. Now I'm worried about how long my JVC Camera will last.If you own this JVC Everio CU-VD20 DVD burner, and have not had any problems with it - be warned that your time is coming."
1,I'm lucky,"I guess I can call myself lucky because I burnt 14 DVDs (not 10) with this device (I actually count them). After that, it would no longer recognize the discs. Big dissapointment to say the least. After reading the previous 1 star review, this thing is going where it belongs... in the trash!...It was awesome when it worked though...No second chance for JVC in my book..."
1,Same old JVC Burner problems,"I originally bought a CU-VD10 which managed to create about 10 disks before rejecting any disk I tried as an 'incompatible disk'. I then decided it must be faulty, but as it was out of warranty went for the CU-VD20. That had exactly the same issues. It is so fussy about the disk type that the 1 type of disk I could get to burn is now off the market. People recommend disks that are limited to the 4x speed, but just try finding some.terrible product, but i couldn't find a way to give it no stars. The Internet is littered with complaints and JVC dont seem to have offered any fix."
5,"Also, my favorite book from childhood.","Living on a farm with no real neighbors to speak of, my little brother and I not only loved this book, but we also lived it. Just like Harvey and his sister Mildred, we fought like crazy but we also discovered that when school was out, we only had eachother. The book made us laugh and also taught us something about being good to your brother or sister."
5,One of my very favorites as a child...,"This book was one of my very favorites as a child, and my children adore this book as well (my mother has the original copy and they love for me to read it to them when we visit her house!). My children always giggle when Harvey and Mildred stick their tongues out at each other and call each other ""stupid, no-good, loud-mouthed and bossy""! I always wished I could have a secret underground hideout across a lake in the woods, and a raft to use to get there. Two of my other favorites (and my childrens') are Miss Suzy and Miss Twiggley's Tree - fabulous stories and fabulous illustrations!"
2,An Anthology of Great War Accounts,"It is difficult, perhaps impossible, at this distance in time to add anything original to the Anglo-American literature on the Great War. The protagonists are dead, so primary source research is not really an option. Under the circumstances, Persico does the best he can with secondary source material. But the result, for readers even somewhat familiar with the literature, is an unoriginal book that adds little, if anything, to what one knows about that conflict. The book ends up being a kind of anthology of other people's writings on the War. The only way out of this conundrum is to write from a truly neutral perspective, or even from the perspective of the Germans. As long as the perspective remains Anglo-American, where the Germans are the bad chaps, I don't see how anything new can be said about this subject. That.... or, we have to hope that someone discovers long-lost documents of state in a proverbial attic that shows the protagonists in a whole new light!"
1,Still wondering what happen on the last day,"I was looking forward to reading this book. It has a catchy title. It may me wonder what happened on the last day. I saw part of a show that I think was made by the BBC on the stories of the last men to die in WWI. I thought this book would be along those lines. Of course my assumption was wrong. After reading this book, I am still wondering what happened on the last day. I hate to do this but I can't recommend this book. It has a few values. You will learn the story of a few men but it seems to read more like a socialist rewritten version of WWI. There are some socialist writers waiting for the last WWII soldiers to die, so they can rewrite the history for WWII. They are waiting so there wont be anyone left alive that was there. No one left alive that can repudiate their socialism revision. This book has that feel. That leads me to wonder if this book is real history or some socialist revision?Skip the book."
2,"OH, WELL","I'm glad these other ""reviewers"" liked this book, because I sure thought it was a sloppy affair. Professor Gilvey doesn't have a great command of language, he frequently gets the simplest of facts wrong (Tommy Valando is not ""the guy who does all those record albums"" he's a music publisher - Don Walker is an orchestrator not an arranger - nitpicking, yes, but, really, it's not brain surgery to find this stuff out, and the book is riddled with such things) - but, more often than not, each chapter is exactly the same as the previous chapter - just change the name of the show. Gower's the greatest, Gower's a genius, the show's not working, the show's working, blah, blah, blah.It's great to have a book about the complicated person who was Gower Champion - I only wish it weren't THIS book, as its subject deserves better. A disappointment."
3,Incomplete.,This book is not complete enough for what it claims to be. A full time lens designer might find it useful as another opinion though.
1,"Lame Idea For A Novel,",Repent 2000 by Michael Anka was a poor excuse for a book. Hardly worth the time or money spent on it! See if your local library has a copy. Save your hard earnes $$$ on a something more worthy!
5,AN ENJOYABLE COUPLE OF HOURS,"The Oak Ridge Boys have been known for different kinds of music in the pastyears, but they really had their start in gospel. In this DVD which is done byWilliam Gaither & co., they go back to that, (which by the way doesn't keep themfrom singing Elvira). Along with songs, there are interviews and some of their oldclips (quite a difference in the hair). It also shows a couple of songs from theold Jake Hess noon-day show. That is where I first heard them sing ""Jesus Is ComingSoon"", it's also the song they opened with on the DVD. During the interviews theygo somewhat into their history.I do agree with another reviewer that it would have been nice if they had showedmore of their old clips from the early days. Still this is well worth watching. Ifyou are a fan of the Oak Ridge Boys or simply enjoy listening to their music, thisshould be an enjoyable couple of hours."
3,cup half full,"I always liked the Oakridge energy but too much talking, very little from early concerts, and age kept this from rating higher with me. The blend and quality in their voices is gone in my opinion and thus not too enjoyable watching for an hour."
3,Broad coverage but not always deep,"Broad encyclopedic study of Biblical references, but with little depth about social or historical forces that shape these. For example, I would have liked some discussion of the Victorian Naturalist or the American Transcendentalist. Addition there is no discussion about Creation Spirituality of Thomas Berry or Matthew Fox. Also I think the author has unwritten assumptions, about what is right, such as vegetarianism. I would have also liked some discussion of the common ethical issues in the cultures and religion and why the societies do not seem to match the ideals of their respective religions. There is still a lot of useful information, and some common threads in all religions, such as the needless suffering in animals and stewardship. This is probably not a good first book, for someone interested in the subject."
1,Just Plain Doesn't Work,Just plain doesn't work. Don't waste your money... yeah I could return it for a refund but by the time I screwed around with shipping and packaging I'd probably be worse off. Don't make a mistake on this one!
1,the useless trim & cut hair trimmer,"I had hoped to use this trimmer to keep my dog's coat shorter in between groomer visits.This gadget is useless, the blade is so unstable that it is impossible to smoothly trim, it chops as it moves, creating a series of 'holes' in the coat.Return for refund is not possible if the package has been opened, so I am stuck with this piece of junk. I would not give it ANY stars."
1,Too bad they don't give the option for 0 stars.,"That's how many this hunk of metal deserves... I have never given a bad review for a product. I feel it necessary, however, to warn others not to waste their money. Please trust the bad reviews, and don't buy this product! This did not trim my dog's hair at all, unless you consider cutting about one to three percent of the hair it is run through a trim. I am really disappointed in Amazon for even allowing this to be sold on their website. To anyone reading this, PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY A NICE PAIR OF SCISSORS!"
1,poor construction,"received pakage in good condition, very difficult to insert blades and have not done so yet. It will just not accept them and the directions included provide very little help in resolving the assembly issue.would NOT buy this product again. Have not been able to use it so-far."
5,5 stars for the old Barber King,"I have an old Barber King and it works very well. It works well for trimming between haircuts -- reducing the need for more frequent trips to the barber. And, if you are not super conscientious about your hair, it gives a decent haircut. I will use it until my last replacement blade wears out.I wish the manufacturer would go back to the older, higher standard."
1,worthless!,This product does not work!!!! If you buy it you will be dissappointed. I threw mine in the garbage. It wasn't worth trying to return it. It would most likely end up on the shelf again for someone else to deal with.
1,Do Not Buy,"I purchased this for my chow/collie mix dog, the packaging with the tool was open and missing parts. Very cheaply made, does not cut at all."
1,What a disappointment!,"I was eager to try this product, but I couldn't even put it together! The so called lock mechanism did not lock and hold the blade in place. I returned it the same day and made an appointment with a groomer. Guess I expected too much for a $10 product."
1,Totally awful,"I have the original barber king and it still works great, but I have no more blades for it. Tried this and it is nothing but cheap garbage that doesn't cut anything, and once you try to change the blade, it will never go back on again."
4,no time for silence,"Secret Voices truly is the voice for hidden entities, mysterious sources of creative energy. How else to explain the audio unleashing of ""No Time for Silence,"" which, ironically, is a sort of audio darkness that expands out of silence. In void, there is meaning. This is true with aural force on ""No Time for Silence,"" sort of an experimental journey into the realm of space music (though by no means can you limit the definition of Secret Voices to space music - it's merely that there is much in common with trad space music ... atmospherics arise and consume!). Eddies of electronic music weave with the guitar sounds for which Tim Motzer (one of the minds behind Secret Voices, alongside Enrico Marani) has become known. Ambience ensconces you as the audio unfolds in unexpected and mesmerizing ways. This is meditation music for the transcendent. Four stars [...]"
2,Could be better,"The texture of the cloth doesnt really stay on the golf clubs, plastic covers may hold better"
3,Golf Gifts & Gallery Neoprene Iron Covers (Set of 9),"Covers worked fine in protecting clubs, but were too loose and would slip off easily, so lost a couple after using only a short time."
1,wont stay on clubs,I bought these to replace a neoprene set I had for years that worked great. They were a worn and finally lost one.On the first round with these I lost one. On the second round lost two more. They just fell off.
2,Not their finest,"Not considered their finest work. First release after firing most of the band and only working with Michael Gerlach (keyboards, etc.). If you like the spacy, keyboard rock, start with Silent Cries or Ocean/Dawn. If you like more guitar-driven, heavier riff prog, start with Metromania, Time to Turn, or Performance. For the psych prog, start with Floating or Inside. I prefer the latter two."
3,RABORN...,This was their last album from the 80s.some good tunes in here.Hero really blows though...not one of their most memorable albums but half of the album is above good so that helps! baby it s spacy once again... doh!
5,the best episode of the season,"truly the best episode of the season. the reason why is the relationship between don and Peggy the way they just know each other she knows so much about him and vise versa and the fact that they have things in common. I wished that the writers would of explored the relationship between them I think that they would be good together. I also like how emotional don got I think it shows how much pain he's in and that he thinks the only person who knew him is no longer here. he fells so alone as dose Peggy, so I loved how Peggy was there for him and how when they always seem to have problems their always there for each other. One of the most powerful and deep episodes of the season."
3,Didn't get what I wanted :(,"I was very excited to see Season 4 of Mad Men on sale for Black Friday and even more excited to see that I could buy the limited edition hologram cover for the same price as the plain cover. Unfortunately, I received the plain cover. Sigh. Oh well. It's an amazing season and I'm glad to have it for a very good price. Very disappointed that the image did not match the actual product shipped."
4,Two sides of Don Draper,"You see the two sides of Don Draper in this episode: the kindly caring Don when he is visiting ex-wife Anna in California, and the low-life Don who cavorts with prostitutes and drags a fellow worker along with him. Everyone else seems to take a back seat to Don in this episode which incisively explores his Jekyll-Hyde character."
5,awesome!,i love this show and now owning one of its seasons is just an addition to my collections - this particular season purchased was in excellent condition and is just a great part of an awesome program - excellent writing
4,Missing scenes?,"I religiously watched all four seasons of Mad Men and own all of the DVD sets. Season four, disc four did not include two hugely significant scenes that impacted Joan's character and the firm Sterling, Cooper, Draper, Price. Joan's decision to leave an abortion clinic and keep Roger's baby and the scene between Lucky Strike's Lee Jr. and Roger in which SCDP is canned are not on the disc. Has anyone else purchased this set and found these missing?"
5,THE Best Drama TV Series,"If you like Mad Men, you'll love this season. I got behind on episodes so I bought this season, finished it all in less than 2 days, and ordered season 5 within the same week. Economical? Maybe not, but it's an awesome show. 5 stars"
1,Don't watch the bonus features! SPOILER ALERT,"What idiot(s) on the crack Lionsgate DVD squad approved putting bonus features on disc 2 that GIVE AWAY PLOT LINES from discs 3 and 4?!!! Their creative director is the anti-Don. Great show, horrid DVD collection. I might as well send back the last two discs... I already saw the highlights! Do yourself a favor and stick to the episodes."
1,How frustrating!,"I love this show, it is the only television I watch and I needed to update flash player in order to watch it. I did update flash player.... twice! and still it won't let me watch! EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING!!!!"
1,Unable to connect to view this episode,For the last two days I've attempted to view this episode after paying for it and have been unable to do so. I've tried at various different times during the day and still no go. I've previously been able to watch several other episodes using the Amazon buy-per-episode service. What gives Amazon?It bothers me that Amazon doesn't offer full download for Macs. Let's grow up... a large portion of Mad Men fans are probably on OSX and there's no excuse for not supplying that service for them.
2,One action in plot totally unnecessary!!,They could have had the character who played Betty's daughter Sally doing something much less embarassing at her friends sleep over. Having her even imply that certain action trashed that little girl actress at a very tender age!! I was appalled!!! Mad Men had so much more dignity & class before it sunk so humiliatingly LOW in this 5th episode of Season 4. I was definately NOT expecting this!!
1,Won't Play.,This is the first Blu Ray disc I have purchased that would not play in my high end Denon player. Been using blue ray for several years and this is the first problem disc. I rated it one as to send a message that you should wait iuntil other reviews confirm if this is a disc problem or a player proble. Denon has been notified.Update 04/25/2011: Received updated firmware from Denon today but it did not fix the problem. All 3 discs are not playable.
1,Incompatable disks,"I purchased season 1-4 of Mad Men for Blu-ray, which we have. Season 1 had 1 incompatable disk, Season 2 had all 3 disks incompatable, Season 3 had all good disks, and Season 4 had 1 incompatable disk. Purchased for a gift for my husband. We really enjoyed the first 2 disks on season 1 and are very disappointed that we can't continue watching in sequence. After finding our first bad disk we opened them all and tried them and are so, so disappointed in the outcome. First time ordering DVDs from Amazon & will not do so again!"
1,Discs Defective,"I ordered a new set of discs and all were defective (the screen said ""reading"" for 10 minutes, then ""incorrect disc."" (My DVD player works just fine.)"
2,"Great show, terrible video service from Amazon","This season of Mad Men is great, but Amazon's video service makes it hard to enjoy. First, if you have a mac, you can't download the episodes and must stream them instead. Second, though my internet speed clocks in consistently at a pretty fast 12-14 Mbps, the video usually shows that I have ""low"" connection speed, pauses frequently to buffer, and has low resolution. I've also often streamed videos from hulu and netflix and never once had a problem with them, so I have to conclude the issue lies with amazon. Finally, when I tried to report the issue, I just got a form email back saying my internet must be slower than their required 1.5 Mbps (again note that my connection is nearly 10 times this fast according to multiple speed tests).I'm tempted to conclude that I've wasted twenty bucks and should just go back to buying shows from iTunes."
3,Greeeat show!!!! Format needs help,"I am addicted to this show and i think the writing, production and acting are all brilliant. 5 stars!However the blu-ray formatting stinks. If u stop it in the middle of watching, whether accidental or purposely, the disc starts from the very beginning each time you push play. So if youre in the middle of the 4th episode you have to go through the rigmarole to find your place again. Negative 2 stars!5 - 2 = 3 (i can do math!)"
5,Fantastic Season!,Season 4 is probably the best yet of this amazing show. Any true Mad Men fan should definitely add this DVD to your collection.
5,SIMPLEMENTE GRANDIOSA,"I love t.v. series like the sopranos, six feet under, nip/tuck, mandrake,band of brothers,breaking bad, xy ,etc. but madmen yeah madmen let me tell you this ,the first time that i saw madmen i was impact for the topic becuase i had never been imagined the way that they sell the products and how to convince the people to love some products, also the charm for the era,the dress fashion ,the ideas of that time, the maleness, the way they make deals, just amazing.The four season is just what i expected and a little more , all the characters in some way suffer by differents situations but at the end all of them are involved for the same company and that means everything.The character of Don Draper oh gosh i just loved him, sometimes is arrogant,others times a genius, lonely, scared for his own past, always drunk, selfish ,merly lost, but at the end everyone has a light.If you love the previous seasons you gonna love this I can assure you that."
1,Dismal streaming quality,"The show deserves five stars, but Amazon gets one for the problems I've had with streaming. Sometimes it's OK, but on evenings and weekends, which no doubt are peak usage time, the program stops and starts constantly. I'm confident the problem isn't my internet service--I never have this problem with Netflix, for instance--so I figure Amazon simply hasn't invested adequately in server capacity or some other resource to support the amount of streaming they're selling. You may want to consider SD rather than HD, or simply wait until Amazon is prepared to support what it's selling."
2,madmen,"It is boring. The same story line all the time, sleeping around, alcohol and cigs-ho hum. They need to come up with something new. I have switched to other cd's"
5,Best show on Television,"Somewhat unusual episode for Madmen, asit's more of a comedy than most episodes. As with most other episodes, it's subtle. The acting is amazing as are the sets, costumes, etc etc. If you haven't started watching this show yet, do yourself a favor and start with Season 1. You won't be sorry."
1,Wrong zone,"I live in Australia, the DVDs are the incorrect zone for my DVD player and therefore I cannot play them."
5,Mad Men,Didn't care for the show at first but it grew on me. Can't wait until the next season to start.
4,MAD MEN SEASON 4,I have enjoyed all the mad men episodes. They are slow moving but you get sucked into the plot and its hard not to watch just to see what's going to happen.
2,Not what I was expecting,"I love ""Mad Men"", and have wanted to start collecting the dvd sets for awhile now, but they have generally been priced higher than I wanted to pay. Imagine my excitement, then, when I found Amazon selling a new copy of season 4 for only $9.99- I was thrilled, but also cautious- I figured there had to be a catch. I researched to make sure the packaging pictured on Amazon was the actual packaging for the dvd set- it was, so I placed my order. It just arrived yesterday, but instead of the shadow picture of Don Draper falling, the cover has a picture of Don Draper standing by a window looking out. I recognize I got a great deal, but if Amazon is not actually selling me the version pictured, then that information should be specified somewhere. I would have paid a little more to get the actual product instead of a version from who-knows-where."
4,Still good,"The Mad Men and Women Continue to be angst-filled, but soul-less and bad, for the most part. I love the tributes that the series gives to current events and how the characters react to them. Joan and Peggy still my favorites."
5,great stuff here,"As a child of the 60's, I think this is a great show... well written, well acted ... it's clever and fun to watch."
3,Sinking Dangerously into Sit-Com,"The advertising scenes--dealing with clients, coming up with ideas, in-fighting, are among the best in the TV Serial world (some of the Soprano scenes come the closest). But in this fourth season, it seems that ideas for selling products are getting harder to find. So the writers are sinking back into what they can do with ease, which is sit-com. WHen I see Draper arriving home, I cringe. When he arrives at the office, I sit back and enjoy the show. The sit-com stuff is begining to take over the entire show, and the show will sink of its own weight. ""When it's good, it is very very good; but when it is bad it is horrid.""Anthony D'Amato"
2,Disappointed,"I agree with the other guy on the amazon service. ""Great show, but almost ruined by poor quality viewer and audio - and no it wasn't my laptop that was at fault.I'll never use this viewer again and will recommend those I know to avoid Amazon on demand videos like the waste of time / money / credits they are. ""As for the season, it lacks the depth of the characters and the social analysis of the previous seasons. It is degenerating into just another alcoholic soap opera and it is easy to predict exactly what will happen to particular characters with respect to the war and the cultural transformation of the coming years-in a cliche manner that has been done to death."
4,"Great Series. If you have a keen eye, the props are a bit aged","The props are a bit aged, the vending machines are rusted inside, the car paints are faded and interiors have also aquired a patina but nevertheless, if you can overlook some of the boring subpdramas, you will enjoy the development of SCDP."
4,Disappointed,I thought I was getting a good price for a great product but after I received it you lowered the price by $8!!! Still it's a great season of Mad Men that I enjoyed watching.
5,tv series,"It is the best tv series I have seen so far, and I am very impatient to have the 4th season on blu-ray, let me have it quick please"
2,Disappointed: the song 'Per Lucia' isn't the original,"I bought this CD because 'Per Lucia' is one of the songs of my life. But not this version of 'Per Lucia'. I liked the original version - more melodious and less 'jazz' - that Fogli taken at the Eurofestival in 1983, but I don't know how to get it."
5,gangs of new york,"The book was exactly as described, I love it! well written and detailed! It was received very quickly, great attention to shipping! Great product! at an amazing price for such a great product! thank you"
4,The Gangs of New York,"This book makes 19th century New York City seem a cesspool of human depravity. The film of the same title from 2003 is not representative of the book: things were much worse and they went on for far longer. Copyright on the text is 1927, 1928. There is a 5 page list of ""Slang of the Early Gangsters"" and a bibliography of 32 titles."
3,Entertaining history,"History, though not scholarly history, he's telling (mostly) true stories, but it's stories and not footnoted historical material. Written eighty-some-odd years ago, the writing holds up surprising well, though from time to time a bit purple and incorrect for modern tastes."
1,Really?,Really cannot remember when I have been so boredhundreds of meaningless names and places and events which are quickly forgottenneither dramatic nor entertaining just a very dry bit of very useless history
2,gangs of new york,book is nothing like the movie and therefor is a large disappointment. This is no fault of Amazom or the seller of the book
1,Southern blueblood from Texas,"This absolutely is one of the worst books I've ever read. I had to force myself to read it--if I buy a book, I'm goin' to read it--and it's beyond my comprehension why anyone would think it's good--unless that person is someone familiar with the areas mentioned in New York City or is interested in gangs. I'm a professor with a Ph.D. in English; I read a lot of different types of books, but l don't think I've ever subjected myself to anything this horrid. It caught my attention while I was in a bookstore; and knowing about the movie with the same title--will it ever be released?--it looked interesting. Boy, was I mistaken. This turkey, considered a classic by some, is best left buried. What a bore! (Incidentally, when I bought it, I knew it was nonfiction. I imagine the movie bears as much resemblance to the book as whipped Jell-O does to mousse.)"
3,The movie was tame,"I paid a buck for this, and after a couple of chapters, I knew this is not for everyone. I'd read of the draft riots in the Civil War-era USA, but had absolutely no idea of the anarchy of New York. After 100 pages, it's time to lay this down for a while, and while yes, the book was written in the 1920's, the prose isn't nearly as archaic as some books."
2,Blurred and unorganized,"As much as I liked its topic, I found the book confused and confusing. It's mostly unclear in which time some events take place, while indications of place are mostly too detailed. It may have been difficult to come up with enough material for all the illustrous characters, but if there are gaps, why not just say so? Asbury makes clear at the beginning that this is not an academic treatise, but that does not give him the right to become unclear.The best parts are the minute descriptions of the Police and the Draft riots, and I found the beginning quite gripping, but the book soon lacks its initial zeal and focus, and the biographical descriptions did not live up to their subjects. There is a surprising lack of enthusiasm on Asbury's part. You don't have to love your subject - you may even hate it -, but your interest should, to a degree, affect the reader."
4,Jewel in the Town,"As a contemporaneous take on nineteenth-century New York, this book is like an uncut gem found beneath an attic eave. Unpolished by political correctness, it supplies the reader with a raw perspective on a multicultural cityscape that bred probably the worst urban violence the land has seen. Modern scholarship has sometimes accused the author of exaggeration or outright mistake. But as far as cold, hard facts are concerned, there seems to be no glaring instance to which one can definitely point. A present-day historian may criticize Victorian views on class and ethnicity, but how can those removed by a century and a half know data better than a contemporary? Like much literature of the times, this volume makes for somewhat weighty reading, but is an invaluable resource for those interested in the subject."
4,Great to see this classic re-released,"Here is Asbury's book, back in circulation, and all is right with the world. Written during the roaring 20s, when New Yorkers wanted to live the good life, Asbury's book came along to show the dirt under the carpets: the crime and savagery that made up so much of New York's history. With neighborhoods like Hell's Kitchen, the Tenderloin and the Five Points populated with such criminals as Monk Eastman and Humpty Jackson, the reader is introduced to a New York City that contemporaries cast a blind eye on, and our generation will never see. True, some of Asbury's sources are undoubtedly questionable. But this is an ""Informal"" history, remember. For me, even those passages which seem doubtful in fact, remain truthful to the spirit of the time and place. I recommend this highly!"
3,a glimpse of the floris writing style of the 20's,"Long regarded as a cult favorite The Gangs of New York is soon to be made into a movie. This book is a long ago chronicle of the rise of native born gangs that were the products of the poverty and ignorance of the slums of New York in the late 1880's and early 1900's. Some unbelievable characters are put to paper, both male and female. The is also a unforgiving look into the brutality and unforgiving nature if crime during the times. Along withthte crime was the graft and the police. A real eye opener. A slice of long ago New York , a bit of a challange to read due to the over the top florrid writing, but enjoyable bit of New York history."
2,It's all about the movie,"I don't think this book would have a chance at notoriety if not for the movie. It's written in a trite style and I always felt as if I couldn't count on the stories as being true rather than hearsay or exaggeration. As someone else said, the book reads as if it were being told at a bar. I couldn't finish it. Maybe I was looking for something more historical or scholarly but then I received it as a gift. I understand the movie plays loose with the book, so where are we at?"
2,A Trifle,"This book accomplishes very little of what it sets out to do. An ""informal history of the underworld"" turns out to mean the book is a mostly dull, mostly anecdotal, mostly impressionistic overview of what some gangs in parts of new york may have been like some of the time. It's not awful. The book is highly readable and, at times, certain anecdotes are interesting. For the most part, however, it's a lightweight and of no real value to anyone who wants to know what gang life was really like. This is basically a tabloid history."
1,Big Disappointment,"Having bought this book about a year ago ...I anticipated it would be a true historical account of the Irish gangs, and an interesting insight to the New York of the ""infamous"" Five Points district in the 19th century. I was sadly disappointed to find the book to be part history, part lore, and a good part boring!Throwing light poles half way across Manhattan? Swimming around Manhattan 5 times (or whatever the crazy story was)? Please, give me a break, not at all what I expected. A down and dirty, true account of what life was really like back then would have been far more interesting if it had not been interlaced with ...tall tales..."
4,"Interesting concept, quick resolution","I enjoyed reading Maier's previous book about Jon Weber, A Skeleton in God's Closet, and quickly purchased More Than a Skeleton. While I enjoyed the intriguing concept of a Jesus like figure returned, I thought the end was a little quick and lacked the detail of the previous chapters. It seemd like a very quick resolution to Weber's current dilema. After the book was finished, I also thought that it was missing a final chapter about where the main characters end up and their thoughts about Joshua and the state of Christianity.Having said all that, the book was definitely worth it. I kept asking myself what I would do if the premise of the story happened today."
3,Fantastic,I love this book. Paul Maier is a great writer. Being a Lutheran I can relate to many of the ideas/comments in this book. He truly brings to light what many of us believe. When I saw that this book was out I had to get it because I had read A Skeleton in God's Closet which I also loved. Thanks Mr. Maier for a great book filled with mystery and laughter! I am now looking forward to reading some of his older books like Pontius Pilate!
4,Def MORE!,I haven't read a book in a long time quite like this one that is packed with romance and thrilling moments that kept me on the edge of my seat. I loved this book although at times I have to admit I was turned off by the comments about different religions. This is def a book to be recommended!
5,My favorite as a child and still at the top of my list,"I have the original 1969 edition and I still read it when I need a chuckle. Creative, inventive and just plain silly. It doesn't get much better than this..."
5,Fun Book!,Full of fun poetry and nonsense ryhmes. Great to have sitting out on your coffee table or desk!
5,Arm in Arm is a precious and life enhancing book for all.,"My mom read this book to me when I was little in the late 1960's, and to this day it is one of my favorite books. I have cherished the original copy, moving from my mom's home to four other cities, always mindful of which box it's packed away in.An original copy is a family heirloom--no joke. The way it made me laugh, and really sparked my imagination was incredible. Here's my favorite(quoted from memory and not verbatim):(Picture a bunch of kids crammed into one bed) It's better to be in a warm bed on a cold day looking out at the cold snow than to be out in the cold snow on a cold day looking in at a warm bed.Something like that. I loved this book. Please share it with your children. And if you have the opportunity, get an old copy because the paper stock was incredible and it was bound, but most of all, the illustrations were beautiful."
4,"amazing, clever drawings and wordplays","A well-remembered, well-loved book from my own childhood, this book amazes me now as then with its clever drawings and wordplays. I recommend it for anyone, of any age, of a quirky, curious turn of mind."
2,Long Tall Texans,"Long Tall texans and Palmers other books tend to be basically the same book. It is tedious. How many times can you read about a much younger virginal girl in love with a much older man with tons of sexual experience and after problems (i.e. sex, another evil women and her insecurities) live happily ever after? It seems that this men cannot handle a grown women so they become invlved with girls barely out of their teens. Palmer should try writing about adults on equal footing and finally give us a love story between a man and a woman not a man and a girl. Also she has the habit of releasing older books with new covers so readers be careful."
1,RIP OFF,A RERELEASE OF LONG TALL TEXANS 2. IS THERE A MENTION OF THAT ON OR IN THIS BOOK NO. I LIKE DIANA PALMER BUT THIS IS GETTING TO BE A HABIT OF HERS FOR EXAMPLE MEN OF THE WEST IS LONG TALL TEXANS 3 SO DONT JUST RUN OUT AND GRAB HER NEW BOOKS THEY MAY BE RERELEASES
5,A new outlook on World War I,"By the time I finished the first chapters of the book, I was rooting for Count Von Luckner and the Sea Eagle."
1,"Dull, dry, cliche","I don't think there is a moment here the actors didn't phone in, not a plot twist the audience doesn't see coming from a mile away, and now in the benefit of time not a special effect that doesn't look dated and poor.It's always a bad sign when even the comic relief seems bored and tired.Not even bad enough to be good, this is the definition of a movie only good as background noise while you're busy with something of actual interest."
4,Harry Potter Bookmark,The bookmark is nicely crafted and special enough to be included as part of my Harry Potter book collection. This bookmark completes my collection of bookmarks for all seven Harry Potter novels. I am pleased with my purchase.
4,A Nibble of Eating Memories,"This omnibus of some of Pat Anthony's shorts clearly shows her having a versatile imagination. At times she borders on being witty, but seems to forget how to carry the ascerbic wit through to a satisfying conclusion. And like many of today's modern female authors, he seems unable to resist bashing men in some of her short stories, something which is patently adolescent, hence why Pat lost one star from my overall rating."
5,Paradise of Origamic Arcitecture,"Though out of print, copies are still available, and the volume is well worth searching out. The designs are wonderfully effective and relatively easy to complete even for the beginner. The rose is particularly lovely, and though it requires time and a little patience, produces the most spectacular results even for a novice."
4,Still Going Strong,"I haven't heard anything new in a long time from Joao Gilberto and so am delighted that he has released this selection of Bossa Nova standards featuring just his voice and guitar. Thirty-five years have passed since the heyday of the genre and Gilberto's voice is just as it ever was. I had to laugh when I read one review that said it sounded cool in Portuguese but lyrically banal when translated into English. Well, this is Brazilian pop, and most pop music in any language tends not to be deep. But compare this pop with its contemporary American counterpart and I'll take the Brazilian every time. Joao is smooth, relaxed, and soothing here and thus is the perfect thing to listen to while sitting on your patio with your morning coffee watching the sun come up. My favorite cuts are Voce Vai Ver, Chega de Saudade, and the all-time classic Desafinado. If you are a Bossa Nova fan, this album deserves a place in your collection. The CD may be short, but it sure is sweet."
5,Doesn't get any better than this,"His music has a way of calming you down even in the most stressful situation that you will be hooked on this CD immediately.I've listened to a lot of his music, but this is truely the master piece. Songs on this CD may seem simple; just the guitar and his voice, but it's this combination that brings out the complexity you will come to appreciate. You will be depriving yourself of more than just great music if you don't own this CD."
3,"Pretty good, but not his best by any means","This is a pretty straightforward album: just Joo and his guitar, playing a bunch of songs he's cut before. Almost exceptionlessly beautifully, with one exception: the version of ""Eu Sou da Bahia"" on this album is HORRIBLE, even more so when compared to the version in his 1973 album, and should just have been left out. The rest of the songs are really good; my favorite is ""Da Cor do Pecado"". The sound could have been much better on this album, though; the bass sounds somewhat muddy. It's also really short at 30 mins.Anyway, this is a really good album, and I was blown away by it when I got it; but after getting some of his older stuff (especially the original recordings compilation, his Montreux live set, and the 1973 album), I don't like it nearly as much.Therefore, in my specially demanding Joo Gilberto rating scale, it gets 3 big stars out of 5."
3,Zen Baiano's voice will never be the same again...,"Joao has remained the same romantic crooner that he was 40 years ago, but his voice is not the same... it's natural it won't ever be the same, our beloved Zen Baiano is getting on... The arrangements somewhat lack expression, they produce and impression of drowsiness. However I have to admit such arrangement is quite good in Eclipse (perhaps the best song of the disk, it's gently swinging like the reflection of the moon on the water). I also enjoyed Da Cor do Pecado, a lovely, sensual tune... But the overall impression is that his best times are gone."
3,Not quite his best,"This is a nice CD. Not essential, but nice. If you want to hear Joao Gilberto at his best, however, you must listen to ""The Legendary Joao Gilberto"" CD. That CD is not only the greatest bossa nova CD of all time, but one of the greatest CDs, period. Unfortunately, it is out of print. So here is what you need to do: go to your public library (my local library has 3 copies), check it out, then burn yourself a copy. Trust me, you'll be glad you did."
3,Poor technical recording,"With a musician of Gilberto's stature, singing such beautiful and intimate music, you'd think the recording itself would be technically pristine and well-balanced. It isn't. It sounds like the engineers jacked up the gain and bass in an attempt to beef up Gilberto's singing and playing. (Sigh.) How long do we have to wait to hear Gilberto recorded as beautifully as he sings and plays this music?"
5,Excellent Storyline- highly recommended,"Amy is a very shy, insecure and is dominated by her father's wishes. But as the story unfolds, Amy becomes a person who knows what she wants after she falls in love and learns to state her own wishes"
5,Wonderful!,"""Fallen Angel"" by Debbie Macomber is another wonderful romance story. I could not put it down and read it in one sitting. If you want to shut out the world for a few hours this is the way to do it."
1,The Calder Magic is gone!,"After Green Calder Grass I was afraid to buy this book so I waited and got it from the library. Smart move! The magic is gone! I have loved the Calder series but the death of Maggie and then the death of Ty really made me not want to read any further. I can't bring myself to care about the characters because I never know who is next on the chopping block. Plus, it's pretty obvious to me where the story is going with Ty and Jessie's daughter and Ty's ex-wife Tara. Tara's going to steal her affection from her mother. Also, I always loved Kat but in this story Janet Dailey all but made her Tara's partner in crime. I almost hated her! The only highlight was Laredo and Jessie's relationship but even that was hard to get into because of Ty and Jessie. Oh well, I gave it one more shot but the magic is most definately gone!"
3,Does not fit!,"I bought this for my grandson thinking it was a boy's size, but apparently it is a men's size. I didn't see any where in the listing that said it was men's. I guess it's my mistake that I just thought it was for boys."
5,Great Entertainment,"This book keeps you interested from page one to the end. It is pure unadulterated entertainment. The characters are fasinating. As in life, the lines of good and evil are not as clearly drawn as some would like to think."
2,Expected Better,"After reading ""The Disappearance"" I thought I had found a great mystery writer in J.F. Freedman. My disappointment in ""Against the Wind"" was profound. Although the plot itself was interesting, the descriptive sexual exploits in the book made it almost repulsive and, in my opinion, verging on pornography. The lawyer's constant flopping into bed with other women took away any admiration I might have had for him as a hero.This author could be one of the greater mystery writers of our time if he would leave out the sleazy and ""more explicit than is needed"" sex talk. He does not need to cheapen his novel in this way as he has enough writing talent as it is to write a best-selling novel. It almost angered me to see him degrading himself in this way. I will give him one more try in the hopes that he wisened up in his later novels."
4,very good read ...,This was very hard to put down.The author took me through several impossible-to predict plot twists that I enjoyed greatly.Minor gripe:At the end of the book I saw several obvious places where the hero just plain failed to investigate critical gaps in the testimony.I like a book more when I'm not saying to myself - why didn't he follow up on xxxx?
5,100% What a roller coaster ride! Exceptional.. Excellent,"Not a wasted word. A Perfectly told story about a lawyer et al defending four men accused of murder. The book is alive and truly interesting and exciting because it's so real... possible The characters are believable down to earth people. The story could be real. (none of that arrogant mr/ms perfect, rich lawyer in their $3,000 power suits etc. etc. defending some billionaires daughter...blahblahblah.)Told in a full and rich manner. 3D. Like I said, not a wasted word. Nice humor as well. Will's first impression of one of the four motorcycle members. ""He's huge, the baby of the group. Red hair in a bowlcut and freckles: Huck Finn in your worst nightmare."" It was a joy to read....I couldn't wait to get back to it each night.I'll be reading J. F. Freedman from here on out. He is head and shoulders above the rest. An excellent story teller. I highly recommend this book. The only thing missing from Against the Wind is an Epilogue."
1,Dead on Arrival,I have been looking forward to the arrival of this DVD player since I ordered it a few days ago. It arrived with the H03 error. I never even got to play one DVD. After searching the internet for the code it appears lots of people are having problems. Many people are not getting the code until after the unit is out of warranty. At least I can still return mine.
1,Don't Buy This Player,"After less than one year, I have also gotten the H03 error code, and the player is dead. This appears to be a common problem from other reviews I've seen."
1,Beware - broke after 10 uses!!!!! - horrible warranty and service,"When the player did work, it was excellent. Sharp playback, screen, etc. If you buy this product, BUY THE EXTENDED WARRANTY. The player comes with 3 months of labor warranty, and when you see the Code: H03 appear on the screen, you will be glad you purchased it. It has to be rebuilt - on your nickel. Panasonic has produced an inferior product that breaks. Unfortunately, I didn't read a review like this prior to purchase. It will cost $150 to fix. Seeing as how I just dropped over $400 four months ago, it is completely unacceptable. Shame on Panasonic, which is a great company with great products, for producing something like this. They don't stand behind what they build. Buyer beware."
3,A one year warranty on parts not labor,I loved the DVD player until I got an H03 error. I thought it was no big deal since I had the player for less than 1 year. I guess Panasonic was right not to have faith in their own product since only the parts are warranteed for 1 year. It will cost me $100 to repair. Thanks Panasonic for great customer service and reliability. Next time I'll buy another manufacturer's product.
5,Great Portable DVD Player! Purchased a year ago...,My wife and I purchased the Sony DVD-LS55 Portable DVD Player 11 months ago. We had several long plane flights ahead of us and were also looking for an extra DVD player for around the house. We did a a lot of research and we have not been disappointed with the money we spent on this player. Excellent picture and sound. This model is easy to use and the long life battery can last for as much as 10 hours. I definatley recommend spending the money on this model.Tony C
1,Don't buy this product,"Used this product for 12 months and just received the H03 code. Tried to fix using recommendations, but didn't work. Total waste of money."
3,HO3 Success Story,"After 16 months, I finally received the H03 message two days ago. I considered all fixes recommended on this site and others. Manually spinning the disc worked once, but the message reappeared. Re-initialization did not work. Ultimately, I needed to open the machine. I was surprised to find a lot of dog hair inside the machine, and I imagine there was a lot of other dirt/dust inside the machine that was not visible. After spending ten minutes cleaning the insides (using a tweezer), the machine now works again perfectly. I think that, in my case, the H03 message was caused simply by the accumulation of dog hair/dirt/dust inside the machine.If this wasn't a great gadget, I wouldn't have bothered trying to fix it. Hopefully, it will work for another 16 months."
2,Barely good enough to keep us watching,"I think that Amazon should have made this movie free for Amazon Prime users, or better yet, pay *us* $2.99 to watch it. A James Bond knockoff, as expected, but pretty lame. Don't let the Asian hottie in the short, red dress fool you. She's not in the movie, nor is anything else worth seeing."
5,Criminally Ignored,"This is an excellent introduction to one of the century's sharpest, funniest writers. Her real talents lay in the acidic theatre and book reviews, which are never less than 2000-word masterpieces.The poetry is much too self-conscious to be great (but then a lot of poetry has that effect on me) and the short stories are rather over-egged puddings, but you could still buy this book for the reviews alone.I only wish I had Dorothy's talent for book-reviewing!"
5,One of the best books I have ever read,"I am proud to have this work on my bookcase... as dog-eared and falling apart as it is. It is one of my favourite volumes, in its entirety - the poems, short stories, and columns. I wish I could write like that. An amazing book by an underappreciated and misunderstood author."
3,Can't quite match the standards set by 'Six wheels....',"Opening with the magnificent 'Bullet', Fluke's follow up to 'Six wheels on my Wagon' is another winner.A somewhat more varied and experimental album it struggles at times to match it's more revered predecessor, nevertheless it maintains interest form the listener. With long ambient tracks like 'Setback' and 'OK' this album has a more space-like feel to it.Worth buying, compared to most of their rivals output."
5,Excellent CD,"I have been following Fluke for a while and have, well ALL of their CD's. This is indeed another wonderful peice or artistry. from the first track ""Bullet"" to the last it is a masterful and tantilizing CD of inspired audio stimulation."
5,Grabs Hold Of You And Refuses To Let Go,"Although this album was released before ""Risotto"", I only recently acquired it. Although I prefer Risotto over this album, OTO has a musical flair all its own. The two cuts ""Squirt"" and ""Setback"" are mixed differently than on Risotto, and so you end up with what may as well be two completely new songs. The first two singles, ""Bullet"" and ""Tosh"" are my favorites. Bullet has this way of subconciously making you bob your head or tap your feet, while Tosh and its hauntingly electric vocals could very well lull you to sleep. As a newcomer to the electronica scene, this disc only reaffrims my decision to delve into this incredibly wonderful brand of music."
1,Lousy!,"If you are expecting the fun and the challenge of the original Tetris, keep on looking. The only positive thing I have to say about this miserable take off on one of the best games of all time is that some of the graphics are nice. This game is so slow and boring that you'll fall asleep long before you reach the highest level. Save your money, and see if you can find a friend with ""Tetris Gold."""
1,DONT BUY,"For starters I did not like this game at all. Its not anything like what the one I use to play on my old computer, which is what I was looking for. It takes forever to get to the game. Then when you play this crazy sexy voice keeps talking. I cant even let my 7 year old play this game. Its horrible. I'm on to find a regular tetris game if possible.JJ"
1,Don't always get what is described,"Description says plainly ""Platform: Win 98/Me/200/XP. When I clicked on Used and new (directly above Platform info) next page left out any mention of XP. I trusted, and got burned.It will not open on my XP computer. The CD I received is not XP compatible. I sent it back to seller, asking for XP compatible in November, and 6-8 weeks later, no CD, no refund. I just today checked the Amazon listing for XP, and exactly the same thing happened--XP is omitted from details of this second page. I do not trust this listing, and don't think I should pay for a second CD that does not specify XP."
1,disappointment,"I was very disappointed in the game itself, but that is not what turned me off on it. I have to keep the CD game disc in my computer in order to play the game. That's just one more thing I have to carry when I travel."
3,The original (in russian) is two times larger,"HelloI have this book and probably is the best book about the casualties of the Red Army in 20th Century but ... the original book, in Russian has mor than 600 pages and my english version only has 300 :-(If in the future will publish the entire book, I will buy it, but nowdays, it is a shame.Best regards"
3,"great stats, but very communistic writing style","great book for statisitcs, unfortunately, the writing style closely resembles Soviet-era propaganda in style and content ( the Soviet Union ""fought the war for freedom loving people everywhere"", ""the Soviet Union liberated Eastern Europe"", ""fought off the fascist scourge"" etc.). For the hard core war junkie only."
3,Purchased but have not use as of yet,"I was told by my local Hydro shop that this is the ""Introduction"" nutrients for the new Hydroponic grower. They are forgiving, easy to use, very concentrated, and inexpensive to start with. Once you master these then you can venture out into the Gigantic choices from many company's ""Supplements"" to push whatever your growing to new levels of performance and eventually into organic Hydroponics."
4,Great practical resource,"I loved _In the Middle_ by Nancie Atwell, but figuring out how to adapt the principles for grades 3-5 had me going in circles. This book provided some great insights into how teachers at all levels run workshops, and gave me practical ideas for getting my own workshop off the ground. I keep coming back to it over and over!"
4,"Boy, was I pleased!","Okay, I wasn't so pleased I could give the book a 5...but it was still a good book. I love Mercer Mayer's illustrations. The story line here is amusing but unoriginal in my opinion. Still there is a lot to be said in support of this little book. For example, this book was selected as a book choice by the Parents Magazine Press. Of course the illustrations alone are worth the time spent reading it. I love Mercer Mayer's illustrations!"
1,This seems written just for entertainment,"I was hoping the book could be used as a starting point for discussing how to deal with anger. But in the book, the Little Critter character doesn't do anything constructive to deal with his anger, he just festers in resentment and anger, and proceeds to do more destructive and inappropriate things, and finally decides to resort to expressing his anger in a very inappropriate way, by running away. I don't think he makes for a good role model. It immediately gave my granddaughter the idea that running away was a potential way to deal with anger, and that then just added to her anger problems that we had to deal with. I'd pick a different book, if you're trying to find a book to help children deal with anger. This book seems written purely to entertain kids with poor behavior."
2,Studengs beware!,"Overall the book touches on some good points and it's an interesting read, but as a class textbook...it's an absolute nightmare.It's an unorganized book filled with grammatical mistakes (to the point sometimes it's painful). It's astounding they make students by this book when publishers obviously spent little time prepping the book for publication.I found my prof's tests on this book were very hard because this book dabbles in SO many mundane details without building on any of them sufficiently. Quite the pain in the arse.A crap book, but required for my class, therefore the only reason why I own it."
1,Did anyone even read this before publishing it???,"This was the assigned textbook for a Kinesiology class at the author's university and I get the feeling that was the only reason this book was chosen since it is horribly written. This is supposed to be a second edition but reads like a rough draft copy. There are countless spelling mistakes, examples of improper grammar, out of place paragraphs and statistics that simply don't add up. It's hard to believe much of what the author has to say in between when the pages are littered with that stuff.If this is for personal use or research, go somewhere else. If it's an assigned textbook, send this review to your professor and ask them to reconsider."
2,So yeaaaahhh...,"This book addresses important issues but somehow still manages to be terrible.The content is decent, but organization within chapters is not very fluid; it's not necessarily blocky, but has the feel of a lot of short semi-related journal articles strung together. Main concepts and themes are unclear and are not emphasized.Many large sections are the book are statistics, one after another. The statistics occasionally directly contradict each other and even the accompanying narrative. Although only a small percentage of the statistics are flawed, any noticeable amount of inaccuracy in a published work by a PhD is dangerous.And don't even get me started on typos.As a student, I feel lost as to which points the author feels are central and which are just meant as background information. I appreciate the importance of the issues the book brings up, but the quality just doesn't deliver."
1,This is a scam,"I recommend stay away from this buy. At only six months of normal use, I used the 5.5"" utility knife to cut straight down on a ball of cold Gouda cheese, and the blade snapped. The blade itself just broke in two pieces, very close to the handle, after applying normal pressure to cut a slice of cheese. I entered the Ginsu website to find a way to claim the warranty, but it cannot be honored because the ask me for a Product Number, which, in these knives, is nowhere to be seen. I've looked everywhere for a Product Number, and I cannot find one. That along with the way that the knife split, leads me to believe that this ""Ginsu"" knife are fakes! Beware."
4,Panasonic RR-US470 Comments,This is a great product for recording notes and has many useful features. It is light and easy to use. I like the option of having a built-in zoom microphone.I also have the Olympus equivalent which is more expensive but has benefits such as built-in USB connector (ie no need to carry a cable) and also stereo recording and MP3 playback. Another benefit of the Olympus is that the file format of the recordings are compatible with my PC whereas the Panasonic files require conversion using the software supplied with the unit. The Olympus does not have a built-in zoom mic. and requires only one AAA batery compared with two for the Panasonic.
3,Don't buy it for the translation capabilities,"As a digital voice recorder, this works fine. With respect to its touted ability to transcribe recorded voices into text, give this one a wide berth.As others have mentioned, the software is incredibly complex and the documentation is flimsy at best. After an exceedingly frustrating (and lengthy) attempt to train the PC software, the results were abysmal. It actually wasn't too bad with my voice but my wife (who was the one who actually trained the software) saw horrid results.That didn't make any sense to me - she trains it, yet it translates my voice far better than hers! What was clear is that her original intention - to translate a roundtable discussion with various participants into text so that would reduce (not eliminate - we're not that naive) the amount of note taking - was wishful thinking.For the price, the voice recorder is fine - the software is terrible."
3,"Low price, not the quality I expected from KV","The shelves are light which is ok, but the hardware is also light which is not. I thought it would be an advantage to have the independent turning shelves, but in use it is much more convenient to be able to simply spin the upper shelf and look on the bottom without having to bend down to turn the bottom one. Live and learn."
2,OK (for a low budget),"If you like bad post apocalyptic movies you might like this movie. When I rented it I expected bad acting, cheesy effects and lame story... I was not wrong in my expectations. Like most low budget films this film relies on excessive use of camera filters and effects."
2,hear the commentary,"I love to listen to commentary, but to hear it on such a low budget film gives you a sense of appreciation upon rewatching a 0-1 star film. you want to make a film and you have $$$ vs. $$$$$$ (or $$$$$ vs $$$$$$$$)to make not cheesy looking costumes, scenery, etc. the drop ship scene was filmed in an apartment for heavens sake. wanting to film, to act, to direct... its a bug, not unlike the cheesy bugs in the film that spoo huge amounts of green goo out of proportion to their dimensions. its interesting to hear how pilot barbie was in refernce to starship troopers, a star map tracing one planet to another a ref. to indiana jones' maps, or one of the cast members was a member of the canadian military and some of the phrases were from the unit he was in. entertaining low budget effort."
2,Star Schlock,"If you like low-end production values, you'll love this collection of clippings from the floor of the editing room.I gave it two stars because someone so obviously did a public service by hiring starving film students to make this school project, and because of the assault by a giant Unidentified Mammary Object in the first minute of the film, and because a couple of the CG effects didn't completely suck, unlike the acting, which really, really sucked.I was able to watch five minutes before closing the window on this one, having glimpsed the hideous monster lurking in the shadows of my Unbox player progress bar. Five minutes. Even Radioactive Dreams held my interest longer than that.I could go on and on, but allow me to sum it up: ""Craptastic!"""
1,Poor,"The film and story was a poor attempt of Star Ship Troopers. Nothing to keep you in your seat, it was very boring, the old saying, you can't tell a book by its cover, fits this 100%."
4,A fun B movie,"I have really enjoyed the recon series. I found the lot of them entertaining, funny and over all a nice way to waste some time and relax. It's not a big budget hollywood film, frankly it's much better. It seemed to me that some folks wanted to make a scifi, as apparently so few do, with aliens, ocasional space ships, etc. They don't take themselves seriously and look to be having a great time. If you enjoy scifi, silly comedie and so on, I recomend this series."
3,ok,"Well... this movie I would say that is ok. It had a good drama regarding the future, it can be unpredictable. This movie made me even wonder how really would be the world by 2020. Overall, I think is an ok movie to see.*Sponsored Post"
3,Read Croft's book instead,"Garth's book is a very specialized study, more specialized even than the title suggests. Garth is good discussing Tolkien's military experiences, but he is not useful in connecting these to Tolkien's works. For a much better discussion of Tolkien and the Great War, see Croft, War and the Works of J R R Tolkien"
3,Dry scholarly tome,"This well documented history will be of benefit to those seeking information on the roots of Tolkien's stories: i.e. the influences of his young friends, and how the horror of war changed his approach to ""fairy stories"".Numerous quotes from Tolkien's letters, essays, and poems are the best part of the book, and the preface and last chapter nicely summarizes how these stories evolved.However, for the average reader, this is a dry unreadable book.I would recommend it for those who wish a deeper knowledge of Tolkien's early life, or for those who are used to browsing a book for the best parts. But the National Geographic films on Tolkien would be a better source for those less willing or able to digest this dry, scholarly tome."
3,Tolkien and the Great War,"There are some gems in the book, but you must wade through most of it being tedious and boring."
1,Torch,"I did not like the story line of this book. It seemed respetitive from the book Wild, therefore I do not recommend it."
1,Torch,I did not finish the book because it was depressing. Maybe I will try again at another time. I just could not read about that man trying to kill himself.
2,Dissapointed,"I am hoping to hear Strayed speak in town next month - I so enjoyed her recounting of her walk of the Pacific Creast Trail. Torch doesn't stand on it's own. The characters just don't have the immediacy necessary to carry me along. Just writing to warn others they may want to borrow,, rather than buy, Strayed's novel."
2,Therapeutic Writing,"It's not often that I don't finish a book. I fell in love with Cheryl Strayed after reading Wild and Dear Sugar, so I was looking forward to consuming everything I could get my hands on. It's clear, though, that Torch isn't what made her for a reason. There is nothing wrong with the book, it just isn't very compelling. After reading the other books and being familiar with Strayed's story, I can't help but think of this as more of a therapeutic writing project for her to explore her feelings about her mother's death than a story that we are all to share. Maybe if I had never read the other books, maybe if I didn't know it was the same author, maybe then I would like it. But for now, I'm admitting defeat and putting this one down."
4,A shining example of trauma's influence on family,"A seemingly strong family can be torn asunder by terrible tragedy. This book is about the family of an accomplished and inspirational woman who scatter and flail about when she is diagnosed with an awful disease. Watching them suffer is painful, because they are such realistic and lovable characters."
3,"so-so; just decided not to finish it,","you know some books are so good you cannot put them down--this is not one of those books. I did put it down, about half-way through it, Written a lot in the same manner as Lost. guess I am just not Strayed""s biggest fan."
4,A Novelization of Our Worst Fears,"So genuine are the characters and events that this book generated tears without making me feel as though I'd been manipulated.The character I most identify with is the one who dies, which makes for a strange reading experience. The novel feeds into every parent's fear of dying before a child is at an age of independence, and of course, the grieving characters' choices will manifest parental and spousal disappointment for any reader. In spite of this, we must concede that the decisions made are perfectly understandable under the circumstances, and therefore all the more realistic."
1,Disappointing!,"The author portrays grief victims as only capable of dealing with their loss through adultery, lies, and various other forms of self-centered behavior. I realize this is fiction but it does no justice whatsoever to those truly dealing with the death of a loved one. I thought this book might be inspirational and insightful, having lost close family members myself. Instead, it was totally depressing and left me wondering why I bought the book in the first place."
3,Very Heavy Book,"This book is about death, dying and grief. It is not an upbeat book, so make sure you're in the mood for it. The writing is excellent and it is compelling, but I can't say I liked it. There isn't a lot happening, maybe emotionally there is, but let's just say there's no action or strong plot lines. I was relieved to finish it, even though it wasn't difficult to read. I like sad stories, but this was just grim."
1,not what I expected,"Maybe , I was expecting something different but after two chapters I knew that this was not for me. I was disappointed in the language and the book seemed disconnected to me from the beginning. I do not wish to read this book"
3,Mother Issues,Was hoping for something the caliber of Wild. This is pretty much a re-hash of the journey of growing up in a dysfunctional family and the pain of a mother's death.
4,Pit Stop,I bought the vhs tape for my brother-in-law and he was happy with that. He had wanted this movie for a long time and does not need it on DVD. The movie was everything he had hoped for.
3,HELPFUL,"Helpful info and tips, especially for the first timer on the contest circuit. Some of the contest info is dated however and things change too often as far as venues, dates, and formats are concerned. That part of the book has limited usefulness."
5,WOW!,"Jicho will have you hooked from page one! It is innovative and exciting from the beginning. Jicho takes the reader on an adventure from 1820 South Africa quickly to present day California in a captivating adventure in which the reader is totally engrossed. Is this fiction...........nonfiction.......or a combination of both? Jicho's protagonists, Drs. Michelle Bouchard and Brace Bellegrine, are a force to be reckoned with intellectually and passionately. The race is on.....will Jicho be caught.....will Dr. Bouchard's son's cure for his neurological disease be discovered.......how many must die before we find out? Even as this demon slithered its way into my dreams I couldn't put this book down!"
2,Poor quality recording,"My girls love the stories, but the quality of the recording is poor. It sounds like the Berenstains recorded it in their basement...."
2,Too damn hard.,These puzzles were just too hard. You'd have to be a Jeopardy or trivial pursuit master to answer these puzzles.
4,Still a ? after all these years,"I lived in Texas at the time of the murders and have always been curious of Whitman's motives. Was it a brain tumor as most of us figured, drug use, upbringing, or a combination of things? This fine book lays out all the facts and theories in fine fashion. An excellent read. Still a bit of a mystery after all these years. Well researched....R.D. Morgan- author of ""The Tri State Terror"""
1,title only......,"a Sniper is a highly trained sharpshooter or marksman, the word sniper has nothing to do with a murderer..!! Snipers are military or police personel who deserve great respect !!"
5,GREATEST RPG EVER!,I have a always been a big fan since the first Dragon Warrior on NES which is what the US version was called originally. If you enjoy that old school turned based style was some fun twist this is a game you'll love. It's easy to pick up but challenging in the long hall. There are a bunch of secrets and additional things in this game that keep it going after the game ends. The only thing that would have made it better was a ps3 release and DLC for it.
5,Keep it on Hand,"We keep this product on hand for our shelties. When they show signs of digestive upsets, we give it for a day or two, and it usually alleviates the problems."
3,Bene-Bac Pet Gel,Cannot tell the benefits of the product on my dog yet. She is still having some stomach issues. I live in Texas. The temperature was 108 degree Fahrenheit when the product arrived. I don't know if heat affects the bacteria.
3,Bene-Bac great product,Shipped quickly and everything seems okay. This is second time I have ordered the Bene-Bac and it is the second time the syringe came in unsealed packaging. This is something the vendor should change.
2,Bene-Bac Pet Gel,"Product needs to be fresh. This vendor [PetAg ] supplied product that was 5 days from expiration. Our pet did not want it, a different response from the fresh product the vet had supplied a year earlier."
5,Wonderful product,I've been using Bene-bac for about 3 month's now and can't believe the benefits to my dogs. I believe this will keep them in great condition from the inside out. Linda
5,A must havae!!,this is a product that I always keep on hand. I like it when weaning puppies; when traveling or when on a show circuit when they can be stresssed.
4,A great album!,"The first three songs are all classic. Buy this album with complete confidence...if you like early 80s New Wave, synthpop, and/or electronic music, you'll like this. Fiction Factory deserved better than the little recognition they recieved."
2,This is a hard core 80's collectable,"I cant believe all the 5 stars in this review. This album has only 1 great song, 2 good ones and 2 average ones. It could've been better if a Greatest Hits album is released instead. Fiction Factory has other great songs besides ""Feels like heaven"", such as ""Let me be the one"". Folks, did you ever wonder why this rare CD costs only 12 bucks? This honest unbiased opinion helps."
2,"Look mom, no hands!","Despite sounding like a potential accompaniment to an infantine circus performance, Jordan Rudess, the third and most recent keyboardist to join Dream Theater, forces the listener to race wildly on the ""great wheel"" yielding high flying fingers, sophomoric compositions, and a humble pretentiousness that could only be a characteristic of a Julliard dropout turned rock star. Although Rudess seems to be an expert at getting what he wants to achieve sonically from his electronic instruments, the album will only entertain those whose musical tastes are amazed by childish displays of virtuosity and showmanship. With the album's closest attempt at seriousness looming in a solo piano piece entitled ""Interstices"" which, like most of Jordan's stylings, is awash with crude embellishment and improvisation, ""Feed the Wheel"" will otherwise manage to flounder at the far bottom of record store discount bins."
4,Killer keyboardist accompanied by great musicians equals a blast!,"This release from Jordan is a diverse selection of instrumentals that fuse rock, jazz, funk and classical styles. ""Feeding The Wheel"" has plenty of strength with prog-rock tunes like ""Quantum Soup"" and ""Feed The Wheel"", but also includes slower melodic songs like ""Shifting Sands"" or ""Headspace"", and amazing solo keyboards on ""Interstices"". The talented guest musicians include Terry Bozzio on drums, Steve Morse and John Petrucci on guitar, and Billy Sheehan plays bass on ""Crack The Meter"". The bass on the remainder of the disc is played via the keyboards and you hardly notice the absence of a dedicated bass player. Recommend for prog fans or those who enjoy thick keyboard orientated material."
4,Really fine,I dont have the spending capacity of the chimpster but I do know a great record when I hear it. Jordan can play his heart out and that gets to my heart when I hear it. My wife hates prog and she asked who was playing when she heard this. Nuff said. He only makes the worlds greatest band even better.
2,Lacking something,"I've been trying to pinpoint exactly what word best describes what this album is missing.. The closest word I can find is ""Emotion"". This music doesn't make me feel anything when I listen to it. It does have some very difficult sections that Jordan plays technically perfectly, but that doesn't mean it sounds good. I also agree that most of the songs sound similar. I only give 2 stars because I hold Jordan Rudess to a higher scale than most artist because I know what he is capable of. His work in ""An evening with John Petrucci and Jordan Rudess"" it nothing short of breathtaking."
5,Definitive guide to the basics of kendo,Excellent resource for the basics of kendo. One of the very few `beginners' guides that you can fully learn the basics without access to a kendo school. I personally found it great help in brushing up the bits in my technique that I had `forgotten' to worry about. Great to watch as well where it can be seen the Mr Wilson truly knows what he is doing and from a trained eye is exceptional in his movement and application.I fully recommend this DVD to anyone who is thinking of starting the art or even the experts who sometimes need to go back to basics just to see how its really done!!
1,Not worth either your money or time,"While I can't speak for his skill in other martial arts, I know for a fact that this man knows next to nothing about kendo. His technique is sloppy at best and all of his movements are laughable. He may have had some training but it is obvious that, at the most, he attended a handful of practices, thought he ""mastered"" kendo, and decided to produce this film and make money off of it. Please, do yourself a favor and do not waste your time on this man or this DVD."
1,Please don't waste your time,"Although I have not seen this video in it's entirety, I have seen excerpts of Mr. Wilson's ""kendo"". It's obvious for any knowledgeable person that he has had little or no formal training in kendo. This is my opinion based on 25 years of practicing kendo.If you must have training videos, e-bogu sells some that are made by Taro Ariga, a well-known international competitor. But really I'd recommend you find a dojo if kendo interests you."
5,Exceptional thru-out,I agree that Jim wilson is a Master of Kendo and I would add he is also a master in teaching on this dvd... he shows each move in an easily understandable way and although I have never tried kendo before I was able to start practicing most of the things he showed almost immediately. He teaches in a very easy step by step way and explains everything in detail... I really liked this dvd and would highly recommend it to anyone interested in learning some kendo moves...I also agree with the previous reviewer that this dvd does set new standards in both presentation and information available from dvd... my copy of the dvd was ok and so maybe the previous reviewer just had a bad copy... I have bought from this company before and I know they do have a no questions exhange policy ... so if he sends it back Im sure they will send him a better copy...sorry about double writing a review but I thought the first one never got thru.
3,A rarely-heard perspective,"This book offers a different perspective on the Arab/Jewish conflict; that is, the perspective of the Arabs who live in Israel and are, in most cases, Israeli citizens.Each chapter in the book is a ""conversation"" between the author and different persons (or groups of people). Through it, you see THEIR views of the ""Palestinian problem,"" and it raises some issues that many people don't often consider. (For instance, if another ""Palestinian state"" is formed, what will the Israeli Arabs do? Leave Israel? Stay?)Overall, this is a good book. I'd recommend it for anyone wanting to understand the Middle East conflict. I would have given the book 4 or maybe even 5 stars, were it not for the PG-13 language that should have been toned down here and there."
2,A sentimental journey into the land of half- truths,"I read this work when it originally appeared in the Hebrew press. Grossman is a skillful writer and propagandist and the work is very artfully done. Nonetheless the work is a one- sided piece in which he makes the Palestinians far more moderate and humane in relation to the Israelis than their own media or their own terrorist actions have ever evidenced.One particular moment of the sentimentalization particularly offended me, when Grossman sees in the face of an old Palestinian the face of a grandparent of his from the Shoah. Perhaps he should have seen in the face of the descendants of survivors of the Shoah murdered by the Palestinians( Of which there are not a few in Israel) the face of his own grandparent.That might too have been sentimental but at least it would have reflected a true historical reality."
4,A fun read!,"Jessica becomes an instant celebrity when she was the single witness to a small earthquake at 3:00 in the morning. Everyone begs her for exciting information about the next earthquake, and Jessica lets this fame get to her head. It's a great and fun story, and worth reading!"
2,Not Guerlain's best,"Colours of Love has a very similar feel of Guerlain's Precious Heart, but much better made. Much better fruit notes in this one. Fruity floral that's very light, but long lasting. Almost a shower fresh type of scent. It just turns horrid on my skin after awhile. Not bottleworthy in my opinion.NOTES: Grapefruit, kiwi, passion fruit and violet, leading to a heart of rose, mimosa, cassia flower and iris. The base is a blend of musk and ambrette seed."
4,A poetic novel about losing your one true love,"An American, now living in Europe, creates an homage to his lover that he let slip away. He reviews his life, from childhood and his unstable upbringing to the self-made end of his perfect relationship and on through the aftermath of various lovers in whom all he can see are aspects of his one true love. through poetic use of language and masterful imagery, White has crafted a unique novel about what happens when you shut out the one person who means so much to you.It's by no means an easy read, and I admit that I had to re-start after 20 pages because I was trying to zip through such a short novel. This novel deserves to be read slowly so that the words and images can make an impact on you, otherwise you will miss something."
1,Pretentious Bore,"I've read, studied, enjoyed and loved DH Lawrence, Jane Austen, Henry James, among others so I'm not illiterate but I was bored to sleep by this novel. Yes, I realize there isn't a plot, or character development, or structure for that matter. It's just a series of musings, ruminations, reflectons, obervances. But many of the metaphors and similes are forced and make no sense. It's must be great fun for the writer to conjure such words and ideas but not for the readers."
4,Solid Baseball Narrative,"This informative and engaging book covers the state of baseball in a key year. In 1939 Lou Gherig retired due to a tragic illness, Bob Feller emerged to win 24 games, Ted Williams arrived in Boston, and the Hall of Fame and Little League World Series began. That was the year the last holdouts (Dodgers, Giants, Yankees) began radio broadcasts, night baseball increased, and television was even used experimentally. Readers learn about broadcaster Red Barber of Brooklyn, the thriving Negro Leagues, and increasing editorials for ending baseball's color barrier. There is also a look at umpire Bill Klem, and Cincinnati's ""Deacon"" Bill McKechnie, who'se intellect and patience were (and remain) a rarity among managers. Author Talmage Boston provides us with an 12 documented and easy-reading chapters. The result is an informative, enjoyable read for old-timers, and anybody else interested in the game."
5,"Cab @ The Door & Midnight Oil, Two Pleasures in One Volume","A wonderful single volume Modern Library edition of Pritchett's two volumes of memiors, Cab at the Door and Midnight Oil. Cab at the Door covers Pritchett's life from before birth to age 18. It is by turns: engaging, enlightening and laugh out loud funny. A good picture of post Victorian/Edwardian England. Pritchett's easy, self-depricating style keeps this poverty coming of age story from becoming another Mein Kampf (my struggle).Midnight Oil is even better and was rightly called ""A little Rolls Royce of a book."" by Wilfred Sheed when it came out in 1972. The best and probably most realistic portrait of Paris in the 20's I've read. Very readable and important to anyone that wants to understand how a writer came to be. The pages fly by. I highly reccomend this Modern Library edition.Complete Collected Stories"
4,Another mixtape....pretty dope though,"Kweli has been on a run with this string of mixtapes he has been releasing. The mixtape features dope tracks from the late great J Dilla, Madlib, Kanye West, and Hi tek. These hi powered tracks along with hot lyrics from Kweli, Jean Grae, Planet asia, and xzibit make this a quality mixtape. I love mixtapes but I am even more interested in hearing Kweli's full effort album that is supposed to be coming out in the next few months. If you are waiting for the next album like me this mixtape will definitely hold you over for a little bit."
2,Dissapointed,"My grandma, a southern woman to the core, gave me this when i was in second grade. Then I had no appreciation for southern stuff. Now I am older and love the south and am terribly fascinated with it. I figured, I'll watch this movie. I am sure I will like it. But as it turns, my second grade reaction was correct. I also thought it copied old yeller somewhat, but I am not for sure on the year of old yeller."
4,Very fun doctor kit,"I can't speak to the long term durability of this toy, as we just got it. However, it seems reasonably well put together as plastic toys go. My four year old daughter loves the kit, and it has lots of different pieces that look like the ones her real doctor uses. The hard plastic case is nice, though I'd prefer it if the lid were attached."
2,disappointing!,"I thought it would be more ""realistic"" and I trusted the other reviews. The stethoscope is a ""fake"", too rigid, and doesn't fit in my daughter's ears (4 years old). The blood pressure cuff is too small and doesn't pump up. I'm very disappointed!"
4,Great toy and great price,"Looked all over for a toy medical kit that had good quality for a good price. Found a lot of other toy medical kits that were cheaply made but way more expensive and they didn't even come with the case, just a cloth bag. My kids love it!"
3,good price for what it is,My daughter enjoyed using this product. She was curious and nervous about seeing the doctor so this helped make her less anxious.
1,disappointing,"I rarely write reviews, but this doctor kit is soooo not worth the $. The stethoscope is useless. It won't even sit in my daughter's ears."
2,Cheap,"The stethoscope does not allow you to hear a heartbeat and dosn't even stay on. The description also said it included a blood pressure cuff, but it didn't. Everything was cheaply made and is definitley for younger children. Luckily, my son enjoys playing with it, which is why IO gave it two stars, otherwise I would have returned it."
3,No blood pressure meter,"good toy for the baby, but it does not include the blood pressure meter, which should be part of the 11 pieces set."
1,"Returned, not as described","I was excited to order this Battat Medical Kit after seeing all of the reviews and purchased it because of the blood pressure cuff. When my kit arrived, I was surprised how cheesey it looked, but again, it's a toy. My kit did not include a blood pressure cuff at all, I don't know if it was left out or just an incorrect description. The case seemed pretty sturdy, but all of the items were very unimpressive. It's going back!"
2,Item we received was not as pictured or described,Both the photo and description state that this toy contains a blood pressure cuff. The product I received did not include a cuff so it will be going back. Big disappointment.
3,Loved the price!!,I looked everywhere for a doctor set but either the stores didn't have any or were too expensive. This was a christmas gift my niece and it kept her and my other nieces and nephews entertained for awhile. It's crazy what an imagination kids have. Definitely recommend this kit for kids 4-up
2,Cheap,This medical kit is cheaply made. The stethoscope won't stay in my son's ears and is flimsy. The blood pressure cuff is too small to fit around my 3-year-old arm. The syringe comes apart and the plunger will probably get lost. Not impressed. Will be buying a medical kit from someone else.
1,"Nothing rises to the level of bachmann, beck, Billo the Clown or limp boss","I keep hoping to find Democrats saying really stupid things. Some of these are funny. None rises to the level of bachman's ""What I love about New Hampshire and what we have in common is our extreme love for liberty. You're the state where the shot was heard around the world at Lexington and Concord.""For really stupid things, one has to go with the republic leadership. I'm ashamed."
2,it's not great,"I find this album primarily oppressive, with the occasionally injection of unintended humor. ""Es la Perdicion"" is the track I play for my friends when I want to demonstrate just how awful this genre can be. ""Es la Perdicion,"" like much of the rest of the album, is a heavy programed drum beat topped with growly vocals and the occasional synth-string flair.I do not mean to say that this cd is un-interesting, or that Elijah's Mantle isn't a good project. (I find ""Sorows of Sophia"" to be pretty impressive, actually.)In the end, I'd say this cd is some of the worst work of either Ellis or Perry. Pick it up for novelty's sake, but for the love of god, don't pay thirty dollars for it!"
4,Incredible...,"Very Dark and Hammering into unfathomable areas of the psyche in ways that seem quite wonderful ?!!! Ha!Brendan Perry from Dead Can Dance adds his inimitable touch of glory, producing a very unusual and pensive album that might rub you up the wrong way if you're not really into such things....The Intro theme is exquisitely brooding and menacing!!!!! Get it."
5,it's the best short story in world,"The name ""Maltese Cat"" is so famous in polo world. I really love this book and read it very often to my children.The story is about a polo game in India. The SKIDARS against the ARCHANGELS. Maltese Cat is the captain of the Skidars ponies is telling the story, all odds are against them but they are fighting till the glorious victory!!Like all of the players and ponies in the polofields all over the world.I'm sure that my ponies also do like the game and all of our ponies are playing the game as well.It's fun!!"
4,ginsu to the rescue,A good knife and execelent fork. I have really said all that I can say about these items. Your 14 word requirement sucks.
4,Love the serrated knife,"I own 1 set of these and got 2 as gifts. It is the only brand I found with a serrated knife which is great for cutting thin slices of lamb or roast. Since i bought them as gifts, I was a bit disappointed that each item showed up in a plastic bag loosely placed within the packaging box. it would have been nice to have them presented in a box where they looked more like a ""set"" rather than parts."
4,Ginsu carving set,Basic Ginsu carving knife and fork set. Very affordable basic set- makes a nice gift withoutspending a fortune on a set that is used just a few times a year.Very sharp knife and medium weight fork does the job.
4,Gardening book,"Brilliant, easy to read book with clear guidelines and stunning pictures, well worth the read and ideal for a gift."
2,Not what I expected,"Really expensive magazine and not much to it. It's pretty thin and usually has a few articles that I save, but for the most part I was disappointed."
4,"My dog doesn't like it, but my vet and groomer do","My dog doesn't like vets or groomers and he doesn't like this thing either. But it works. It seems comfortable and allows him to pant, which is important because he only has to wear it when he is freaked out - which means he's usually panting! He hasn't been able to pull it off either.The only thing I don't like about it is that when it collapses (to store) the mesh part folds inward, which means when you put it on the dog, it presses in toward his nose and rubs it. So I usually store with with a rolled up paper towel to keep the mesh pushed out."
5,Heyday of Pittsburgh Steel,"Easy-to-read historical novel with strong autobiographical content, follows three generations of steelworkers from Saris region of NE Slovakia from 1881 into Depression. At work and in school the ""hunkies"" are taunted, frustrated, and angered with pig-sty housing and exhausting work conditions. Yet this sharp protest for social justice also rings with romance and a plea for understanding and human decency. Great book for the literature or sociology classroom: teaches well."
3,A drag with cliff-hanging ending paragraphs,"I am a history major and am fascinated by American history. To be honest, I looked forward to reading this book. However, I found that it was a snooze-fest. In fact, I liked the historical references that I was familiar with: Pullman Strike, historic PA (I'm from Pennsylvania and my family worked in White Haven), Cleveland's assassination, Mckinley, etc. However, it just fell short of expectation. Some characters were not clearly identified. Also, for a few pages it would drag out and then, all of a sudden, there would be a crowded paragraph of action and information. These small paragraphs would get me interested but then it would drone on a bit again. It lacked clear focus and Bell should have detailed more aspects than others. Overall, it wasn't terribly painful to read, just was a bit over-rated."
4,Out Of This Furnace - review,"This book was recommended to me by my brother-in-law who resides in Pittsburgh.Thomas Bell, the author, does a fantastic job of taking the reader back to the turn of the century and the birth of steel industry. Bell readily admits borrowing from his own family's history to detail everyday family activities and the grind of what it meant to be working in the steel mills of Western Pennsylvania. These are the same stories I have heard from my friends as they have been passed from generation to generation. The book is engaging, gritty, heart-breaking, honest and filled with history. Anyone who has had family members work in the steel mills could read this book and likely see their own family's life unfold. Congratulations, Thomas Bell."
2,Review of Hudack,"I felt as well as several of my fellow nursing students that this book was very difficult to read.It is very extensive information wise, almost overwhelming."
3,Critical Care Nursing,"I bought this book for my Senior Critical Care Nursing Class and found that it goes into alot more detail than I needed. However, it does cover everything you need to know about what you will encounter in Critical Care."
1,DO NOT BUY FROM HIM,"This guy completely lied to me. The product description states that there is a baseball BAT. Today I opened the package and what do i find? Just a BALL, no BAT."
2,Ball quality is JUNK,"Red ring breaks very quickly. Unless the child is very young, you will break the balls very quick."
1,NOT DUABLE AT ALL,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!! i bought this junk ball and gathered up the nieghborhood kids to play and it litterly took one hit and it just ticked the ball and the red ring broke off and the ball dented i suggest just buy a wiffel ball set.
1,What!?!?!?!!?,"I ordered this because were having an end of the baseball season wiffle ball tournament. In the description its says 32"" junk ball bat with a sweetspot and a junk ball. This was NOT the case! It only had the little ball, it didnt come with the bat!"
1,Huge rip-off,"I ordered a Junk ball bat and ball set- The ball broke within 15 minutes, and the bat they sent was not a genuine Junk Ball Bat. It was cheap, and not what I ordered. The picture of the merchandise was completely different from what I received. My son was completely disappointed. I will never order from here again. I was ripped off. Very unhappy."
3,Good Reminders - Not Mindblowing!,"I went to Stephen Snyder's Credit After Bankruptcy seminar and learned a boatload of stuff I didn't know about credit and FICO scores. This book is an excellent set of reminders of what NOT to do after being discharged from bankruptcy or if you have credit problems in general. Is it epic? No, not really. But I consider it like having my own ""38 commandments of credit"" and a worthwhile crib sheet of the do's and don't's."
5,Another Great Kate Walker Book!,"India Marchant has planned for everything in her fairytale wedding...everything except the groom walking out on her before the I do's are said. A year later he's back holding the deed to her house. What does Aidan Wolfe have in mind for her now? Is he out for revenge, or could he be out to get something totally different from India...could he be looking for a new beginning?This is a great book for fans of traditional romances. Kate Walker knows how to deliver a story that's emotion-packed and touching."
4,Ok but...,"I was looking for a sweat proof headphone and this product fits the bill.The only issue is that the cable is coiled which is both a positive and negative design feature. When running, the cable will bounce everywhere unless I hold it down. I guess I could get a cable clip to hold it down. On the positive side, if the cable gets caught on something, there is a some slack in the coiled cable design."
5,Work great,I bought these on [...] for $7.99 and have used them mainly in the gym and on bike rides. They hold up to a lot of sweating and sound great as well. The behind the neck design is also very comfortable and do not get in the way when doing bench press or anything else that requires lying down. I also like the coiled cord that only comes out on the left side thus not getting in your way. It also acts as somewhat of a spring and happen to save my Iphone when it fell out of my pocket.
2,The search continues....,"This was a great idea. But the sound quality sucks. I get better sound from my $10 Sonys. It sounds as if you're hearing the music from far away. There is absolutely no bass. I need that to keep me going during my workouts. But it's sure to stop me from breaking out since I can easily wipe the earpiece clean after every workout. I'll use them, but I don't love them. Time to consider using in the ear headphones with the clip that goes around the ear. Oh yeah, the silicone is soft but it feels a little heavy on my ears after like 30 minutes."
4,Golf ball retriever,"The retriever is very effective and easy to use. I have picked up many balls since I used it. It is flimsy when reaching to a distance, but it is definitely useful along the pond shore."
5,A man loved and respected by so many,"Shan F.Bullock truely captures the essence of Thomas Andrews, and what he meant to those who loved as well as worked with him. His passion for his work and his love for life are clearly an inspiration to all who read this book.Though he had already accomplished so much in his brief lifetime, the reader is left wondering how much more he could have contributed had he lived. There is one line in particular, written by Sir Horace Plunkett in the introduction that has touched me deeply. It read, ""There is not,"" ran this fine epitaph, ""a better boy in heaven."""
2,Unthoughtful ending!,They could have taken this movie to whole other level but they just made another mundane movie...so that was it? she took the children away? They should have had a twist or two at the end...not worth spending time on it at all.
4,The Best of VERY Early Fleetwood Mac,"""Pious Bird"" is a sampler of sorts of very early Peter Green-era Fleetwood Mac (i.e. prior to the Green/Mac classic ""Then Play On""). It does include the original ""Black Magic Woman,"" along with some foreshadowing of Peter Green's greatness on ""Looking for Somebody"" and ""Albatross."" Otherwise, it's fairly unexceptional, competent 60's British blues - very similar to John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, but with a bit more emphasis on guitars.All in all, good British blues, but not essential."
1,misleading,"When I bought the whole set of these math books, it said it included the DVD. It does not. The wording is very misleading and I am very disappointed."
3,not for all homeschoolers,"I bought this for my 4th grade daughter (homeschooled). It did not work for us. I need a curriculum that includes explanations & instructions -I am not very good at just ""winging it"". In other words, there are no instructions with these lessons, so for each new skill you will need to be able to explain to your child the how/why of it all. We switched to Bob Jones instead & like it very much."
3,Suit Fans Of Early ELO Recordings.,"This Best Of only covers 1971 - 1973, so really early days only.Some of the songs are quite experimental and therefore not particularly to my taste.10538 Overture is a superb debut single which is not on all their Greatest Hits collections, sounds like ELO were listerning to The Beatles I Am The Walrus, in fact so does most of the ELO cataloge !Showdown is good, as is over 6 minutes of Roll Over Beethoven.So if you want the bulk of their hits, try elsewhere."
1,Great band but dismal best of collection,"I quite like ELO and I Picked up this best of collection cheaply. It's terrible. The tracks selected as ""best of"" are simply not the best of ELO at all. On top of all that the production just seems terrible. As a result I very rarely listen to this CD. Do yourself a favour and go buy another ELO collection."
4,"Made a Splash, But Not Happy","I thought I had thoroughly researched the Kettlers, but I didn't get all the details on this one. Unfortunately, Amazon got them wrong. They advertised this bike as having the ""free wheeling"" option, when it DOES NOT. I love the quality of the bike, have had no tipping problems, and the upgraded wheels are great. I'm giving it four stars because the pedals hit my daughter's feet when she doesn't keep them pedaling. I'd recommend spending more to get those free wheels."
1,Broken Weld,"My preschool bought 10 of these trikes. They are not used on a daily basis and they are stored in a building away from the elements. The children who use them meet the recommended age/size. Seven of the 10 broke in the same location (the wheel fork)where it is welded together. The manufactuer was very unwilling to help us replace the parts. Obviously the location of the break has been caused by faulty manufacturing. I do not recommend this trike and question the company's commitment to quality, safety assurance and customer satisfaction."
4,Excellent Resource for Preschool Sunday School,"I ordered this book to help me come up with simple crafts to do with preschoolers during short Sunday School sessions. There's a great variety, and tie-ins with Bible stories from both the Old and New Testament. I especially like that there are two or three craft options for each lesson, so I can pick the one that will work the best with our small group. The crafts are all fairly simple and require minimal, easy-to-find supplies. This is a great book at a fabulous price."
2,Not what I expected,"I researched alot of reviews before buying this craft book. It had 4.5 stars, but I was leary when I couldn't search inside. I thought that the crafts were lacking. Some seemed a little hard for preschoolers. I have found better results just searching the internet and getting free ideas. Overall, I thought the book wasn't that great and shipped it back the day I received it."
2,I was disappointed,"There are lots of crafts in the book, but very few that I thought were very engaging. If you're looking for something that will be finished in 15 minutes this may work for you. The most disappointing thing was that out of 200 crafts, there were only one or two that provided patterns. I'm planning to return it for a refund. I liked Preschool Christian Crafts a whole lot better. There were only 37 crafts in it, but patterns were provided and they were fun, yet simple enough and engaging enough to satisfy preschoolers."
5,Dvorak and his talented son-in-law Suk,"Serenades for Strings - Josef Suk & Antonin DvorakI have enjoyed listening to classical music for many years and am reasonable familiar with the major works by the ""name"" composers. My musical antenna goes up when I hear an enjoyable piece by an individual previously unknown to me.My introduction to Josef Suk (1874-1935) was on a BBC Music CD "" An Enchanted Christmas"" Vol. 17 No 4. The piece was Suk's Pohadka-A Fairy Tale. I next purchased ""Serenades for Strings"" and my initial admiration and enjoyment of Suk's works was fully rewarded. I am not a musician and can only recommend this disk based upon my subjective judgment.This is a Naxos CD. If you purchase classical CD's you already know the packaging, documentation and recording are first rate. If this is your first Naxos purchased I would wager it will not be your last."
1,No Customer Support,I ordered this product and it was shipped missing pieces. I contacted the seller and was told to send a e-with all kinds numbers and they would get me the part. I sent several follow up e-mails and never received the part to assemble this. Do not buy from Elegant Home Fashions!!!
4,Kawasaki 18v drill spare battery,"I had bought the Kawasaski 18v drill on sale at a Meijers store and since it only had one battery, I searched for a backup battery online. I found it through a vendor with Amazon.com. It works wonderfully. No problemo..."
4,works like the original,"After two years, my original battery stopped working; the replacement delivers the same performance as a new original. Why only two years of light use? I don't know and that is why I gave four rather than five stars."
5,Just as stated,The battery was shipped quickly and in good shape--charged right up and so far is holding charge
4,Cautioned Buyer,Well being the first time to buy a neckless over the internet without seeing what you are buying other than a picture and a discribtion.I was not dissapointed the neckless was better than it was discribed.the diamonds were very clear and was looked at by a local jewely store because of the latch and they them self said it was a very nice piece and the clarity was excellent. So was a good buying experince
4,Delightful,Very pleased with the design and appearance. Lovely pendant on very tightly made white gold box chain. Oppotunity for improvement: packaging. Would have preferred simple jewelry box to plastic bag inside cardboard sleeve-type box. My wife loves it.
1,Too small to identify on a beautiful woman :(,I bought this for my dear lovely sister...however it was too small!!! in fact you can get similar design in stores at a dirt cheap rate..i had to return this.Full marks for amazon for their return policy!!!
3,LITTLE BIT LITTLE,A little smaller than I expectred for the price. Chain is very thin. Comes in nice box. Clarity could hve been better for price. Worth the sale price but not the full price.
5,VERY UPSET - POOR QUALITY ASSURANCE,"I received this necklace yesterday and gave it to my wife early as we are about to go on a cruise and I felt she could wear it while we were gone. I was totally embarrassed when she opened the box. The chain was in a knot that looked like someone spent the whole day tying it up. There was only 1"" of chain there, the rest of it was in a huge knot. I had to take it to a jeweler and it took him almost an hour and cost me an additional $25.00 and he spoke very poorly of the quality of the necklace. I will never buy from this company again. If they can't check the items prior to shipping, I had rather pay a few dollars more to get better service."
2,Crown Jewelers Sell this same necklace and pendant,whom ever is selling this item its in other Jewelery stores like Crown Jewelers. I have a lot of Jewelers at good price and sometime your have too search stores too find the best price for what your looking for.
3,Chain Broke,"The chain broke on the first night I gave it to my wife. I sent it back and they gave me a full refund, but my wife is still giving me grief over the whole incident."
5,Perfect gift for my wife,"I was looking for something different to give to my wife for Christmas (2007) and this looked good online. I was a little hesitant, but when I received it and she opened it on Christmas morning, we were both very pleasantly surprised! I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a bargain, but also something that returns much more for the price than expected."
4,Great Purchase,"My fiance loved this pendant as her Christmas gift. It is absolutely stunning. Most importantly, she never seems to want to take it off."
4,nice buy,My wife was wearing this for almost a year and the chain broke. Chain was a little weak. Other than that the pendant looked great.
4,Recommended,"A bit smaller than I have expected..but considering the price, it's a pretty good buy! Sparks nicely in sunshine! Girlfriend loved it! So, go ahead!"
4,1/2 carat Journey necklace,I was very pleased with the purchase and it arrived just in time for my wife's birthday and Valentine's Day. I used the Super Saver Shipping option and was not disappointed. My wife had a appraisal done for insurance purposes and the color and clarity was spot on. I was able to insure for more than I paid for the necklace because it appraised higher. Will definitely shop for jewelry here again.
3,Journey Pendant,Returned it... clasp did not work properly. But more importantly - the pendant was very small. Beautiful but small.
4,"Great score, poor songs","It's a shame that one of Trevor Jones' most ellaborate and efficient scores gets lost in this uneven album, among a bunch of easy-to-forget songs. The score is really great stuff, though. The Main Theme is amazing: it's worth the buy alone. If you love scores you should give this one a try; rent the movie if you want to know for sure. Mr Jones' music sets the tone for an underrated movie and virtually saves this album."
2,For the mellow or comatose,"I bought this album, and I keep it in my collection only for the ""I Left My Heart in San Francisco"" song performed by Tony Bennett. I don't have any other copy of that song. Otherwise I wouldn't keep this around. It wouldn't be worth the space. It is not that the other songs aren't okay. They are...okay. They aren't terrible. I just don't ever feel like listening to them."
2,Don't lose the driver disk,"I've had this recorder for 3 years and use it for my job to record meetings, of which I then produce written summaries. It works OK, but I have a new laptop for my job and I want to install the driver software on the new machine. I haven't done that because I no longer have the original driver disc and Panasonic wants me to pay for a replacement (no free download). I don't want to waste the money doing that because the new machine runs Vista and the software doesn't work well on Vista. My recommendation is to get a recorder from a different company with better customer service."
1,the worst hair removal in 20 years,I have been using epilady since I was 12 or 13 (I'm 32). Have been pretty loyal to epilady until this particular model arrived. VERY slow; barely removes hairs. Does not do the job in the last.
2,Don't buy it. Doesn't work. What happened to Epilady?,"I had the original Epilady Ultra for 15 years but it finally died on me so I got this one and it BARELY does the job! Takes three times as long, winds up being much more irritable to my skin because of all the rubbing back and forth, and the hairs come back in a couple weeks. I used my old Epilady about every three months because the hairs were so light! Don't believe that 5-star review just because you want to. It might even have been written by someone at the company."
2,not good for legs,"I have waxed for ~15 years. I tried the laser hair removal, and it wasn't permanent, so now I'm back to finding a solution. I thought I'd try this because it was inexpensive, and I couldn't find the old one. It takes FOREVER to do my legs, and I have to go over it 3 or 4 times to get one hair. Maybe because my hair is so fine now from all the previous removal efforts? In any case, I'm now in the market for a different epilator and am looking at the ""Braun SE7781 Silk-Epil Xpressive Epilator Body System, Rechargeable"" which seems to get really good reviews.I gave this product two stars instead of one because it does work well under the arms. It's a small enough area that I can tolerate going over it 3-4 times and all the hair is gone. Definitely better than shaving or waxing (no more akward elbow-on-the-door-frame waxing tug of war with the underarms!) But if you're looking for one epilator to do it all, keep looking!"
2,Bad Quality,This robe will work for a small child. NOT FOR ADULTS. Probably can only be worn once. I put it on and it ripped under the bust as I pulled it down.
5,Wonderful book,"I love this book. It has many of Carly's older favorites, and has a great photo section that's priceless for any Carly lover. I had this years ago and lost it over the years, and am so happy to have found it here. The arrangements are great for beginners and advanced, and are so much fun to play and sing along to... hours of musical entertainment!"
3,For the Chevy Man,"I got this for my fiance who is a big Chevy man. It made the perfect stocking stuffer. The Chevy symbol on the nuts and keyring are just a simple sticker, but the price wasn't very high so it made a nice gift. It really is a cute set."
2,"Lots of Books, Bad Breakdown","This book would have been a valuable resource, if it listed the books by reading level. I was hoping to find good chapter books for my daughter to read (2nd grade reading level). But all I find is a huge chapter labeled ""Chapter Books: Ages 6-11"". This book should only be recommended for parents who have lots of time to cruise the library going from book to book, looking for something at an appropriate reading level for their child."
3,Good but not the best guide out there,"This is a decent guide, so it's too bad it lacks age levels. If you are looking for a more up-to-date guide with more books and an age range for each book, try Great Books for Girls by Kathleen Odean, revised in 2002."
4,"Saying ""Thank you""","No matter how many times we say it, we can never thank our mothers enough for the gifts of life and love. This book is a beautiful way to appreciate the mother who rocked you to sleep and bandaged your scraped knees."
1,Gravy boat and tray,"I was disappointed with this item. We possess a large set of this china, all of it made in England. When I ordered this set, it was in addition to several add on pieces. All of the pieces that came from the Amazon store were of the same high quality, having been made in England. The gravy boat and tray were made in Columbia, S.A. and I feel not up to the quality of the other items."
5,Great Book for all Ages!,"We got a copy of this book from the library for a report/panorama for my daughter's 5th grade class - what a Great Book! There are interesting things to learns about many cultures and fun things to make as well (art, food, house models, etc...). My daughter is making the Mayan house for her panorama (easy to follow directions too!). My six year old son has bookmarked tons of things he has picked out to do as well. So I am here to purchase a copy for our 'library'. It is well worth the money - especially if you want your children to learn about other cultures. It's good to look outside the fish bowl."
3,Lid and hinges problem,"Our toy box lid is usually always kept open so a few months after we got it our daughter decided to shut it after she threw all the toys out, and the top piece of ""wood"" that is attached to the real natural wood snapped off.. this was bc the hinges were dried up and didn't budge when she tried to shut it so it ruined the lid.. we nailed it back on then one day it got dumped over and another peice broke off.. we ended up being able to order a replacement lid and hinges, free of chrage.. BUT i must advise if you think your child may try to dump it over or be rough with it, this isn't the toy box for you.. It looks nice but it can't take too much abuse... Go for plastic. they are safer."
2,Not a happy camper.,"When I bought this toybox, I was warned that it was a little difficult to put together and the quality wasnt great. The person warning me was correct. It took me hours to get it together because some of the holes didnt line up correctly to put the screws in, and it doesnt stay together so it isnt safe for children unless it is glued secure. I wouldnt have gotten a toybox that had to be glued together the 1st time it was moved from one part of the room to the other. On a positive note, once the glue dried, it does look very nice in the childs room."
3,It's all worth it for...,"...ENTHUSIASM FOR LIFE DEFEATS EXISTENTIAL FEAR. If you are in a serious relationship or are married etc. this song will hit you right in the chest. On Mystics Wayne showed that he can have fun and not be serious all the time, but this song shows he's still that grey-haired intellectual indie-rock pioneer we know him to be."
1,Complete waste of money,"The live portions of this CD, which is most of it, sounds like someone was holding up a tape recorder in the middle of the audience while the band played. It's been a long time since I've heard such poor sound quality on a CD. Only the most die hard fan should consider purchasing this."
2,Not like the original by Mark Prophet,"EEEEEKERS WHAT HAS SHE DONE!!!!!! She being Elizabeth Prophet. Now I know where metaphysils get a lot of their bunk. Good book for understanding misconceptions. Grains of truth embedded in the muck, gunk, and mire. With out discernment this book will take you through a lot of tundra trudging."
4,An excellent overview,"The author, demonstrating knowledge that can only be termed encyclopaedic, gives an excellent overview of a diverse body of literature devoted to the issues of gender, sexuality and identity. After reading this book I have a firm understanding of the evolution of queer theory and the bibliography will prove invaluable in reading further about various aspects of this fascinating subject. The book is especially valuable as it gives mention to various movements, such as homophile, gay liberation and lesbian feminist, in an Australian as well as American context. Be warned though, you may find it handy to have a dictionary around."
4,Pretty Good Introduction,"This is a well-written, concise introduction to the ever-growing, booming field of queer theory. As more and more people are coming out of the closet due to an increasing acceptance of homosexuality, queer theory and gay and lesbian studies will absolutely thrive. There are so many gay people in America alone, and it seems like more and more people are coming out every day. Heterosexuality is boring and Establishment. Without gays and lesbians this country would be extremely dull and intellectually starved. Jagose's book is a real wake-up call."
5,Hope and inspiration PLUS ideas,A truly remarkable book full of hope and inspiration for anyone who is in debt and wants to get out. The stories of how others have done it offer so much encouragement while providing practical ideas to make the day to day decisions easier. It's full of examples of how reversing the debting dilemma changes other areas of one's life. A must read if you feel hopeless and helpless about your financial situation.
3,Scandals by the sea,"When you feel like reading a gentle book, a not too demanding book, this is the way to go. It's 1905 in Culvergate, a seaside resort town on the English coast where strip shops are the only way to go and the shopkeepers work very long hours to make their money during the summer months to tide them over the leaner months of winter. A scandal erupts when an attractive youngish widow opens a hat shop and where, horror upon horrors, gentlemen are seen to be entering the premises after hours, up the back lane.When these men are identified as some of the more prosperous shopkeepers, the gossips have a field day and lives are changed forever."
4,A-Z help at your fingertips,"A great book filled with tips for when you've had it! It offers both quick advice to try immediately as well as strategies to help you plan ahead and be prepared for the next time. Just about everything you can think of is addressed in this book for parents of tots-teens. Thanks Elizabeth! You have obviously ""been there, done that"" along with us...AND you're still doing it!"
5,Help when you need it most: RIGHT NOW.,"This is a wonderful and extremely helpful book for looking up quick and informative answers to questions about helping as well as discliplining children. It is alphabetical, so you can look up ""Bedtime, getting to bed peacefully"" and it offers three great, sane, and loving ideas. The next section is: ""Bedtime, staying in bed"" so that it is very easy to follow and you can look up almost anything you can think of such as: ""not coming when called"" and it will say to look up: ""Cooperate, doesn't;or Listening, not"". It has helped me tremendously, especially when it is often hard to get a quick, concise answer out of other parenting books when you REALLY need it right away, as the problem is occurring."
3,Just So-So,"I bought the case of 9, and I have used 4 of the 9 bottles in a front-loading, high efficiency washer. Getting clothes clean is so-so. I do not believe that my clothes are as clean as when I used Cheer HE. What I really can't live with is the smell. I have quit using this product and have re-washed everything that I wear. I do like the small bottle quite well."
4,Wash your detergent before using it,"This product is just great and works as advertised. However, Amazon's packing and shipping is terrible. I read about this in the other reviews and I didn't think it would happen to me but it did. Every one of the bottles leaked in some way. The detergent did not pour out thankfully but each bottle cap was sticky and gooey with leaked, dried out detergent. I would not buy this product from Amazon again - not because of the product itself but because of the hassle of having to wash and dry each bottle before storing/using it. C'mon Amazon - get a clue. Shipping liquids is diffent than shipping books."
2,Not as good as the old formula,"The new formula has no progesterone, making it minimally effective, at best. Nothing has ever gone right with the seller, either. I was short shipped what I'd ordered, and a different product substituted!"
1,"I've tried them all, these are the worst!",I put them in four different burners and the results were the same. Coasterville.
4,A clarinetist's perspective,"A fine CD that I can recommend for clarinet and string enthusiasts. Note that there are two clarinetists listed on the album cover. They take turns as soloists accompanied by members of the Danubius string quartet. The recordings are very useful for musicians, such as myself, who prepare to perform these pieces with their own groups. Overall, a very pleasant and enjoyable CD."
5,Some nice tracks on here!,"This is a compilation of tracks from bands on Mimicry records. Their bands are a bit off the beaten path, but there's some interesting stuff, like Sleepy Time Gorilla Museum. I particularly liked the track by Brazzaville."
4,"A thought-provoking, painless way to study history","I want to recommend a book I've read by Studs Terkel entitled My American Century. It's a collection of edited interviews with a wide-ranging assortment of people, organized by major time periods/topics (for example, the Depression, WWII, the American dream). It is remarkably well done, allowing each person to tell his or her own story. Terkel is adept at letting the individual's voice come through, and the stories are sometimes startlingly interesting. For example, one man talks about his personal journey from leadership in the KKK to reaping kudos for human rights activism. It's a painless way to understand the history of the United States in this century, brought to you by the people who lived it. It's as good a read as any novel"
5,Simply Amazing,This is the greatest book I have ever read. It has honestly changed the way I look at life.
5,Callas is perfect,"It's easy to dismiss the ridiculous critics of these concerts who pick apart Callas' missed high notes, precarious singing and enormous vibratto. This woman and her singing are beyond reproach, her acting is astonishing (especially as Lady Macbeth and as Imogene in 1959) - and this DVD is in desperate need of reissuing.Callas is absolutely hypnotizing, singing mezzo arias by Verdi, Bellini and Bizet. Apart from her insanely effective acting, I find the most compelling aspect of her performance to be her deteriorating high register: any note above a high Bb was sung with tremendous vibratto, Callas' notorious wobble.Still, that anyone rates the footage on this DVD - or indeed Callas' singing itself - as anything but genius is preposterous. This is a required document of the greatest singer and greatest actress in the history of recorded media."
5,The Gun in Betty Lou's......Triple feature,"The Gun in Betty Lou's Handbag is hilarious, Gross Anatomy is sweet and entertaining and so is Betsy's Wedding! The prize is very reasonable so You can't loose."
4,DVD Gift for mom,I ordered a DVD Triple Feature: The Gun in Betty Lou's Handbag / Gross Anatomy / Betsy's Wedding as a Christmas gift for my mom. She loves the movie Betsy's Wedding and was excited to get it. The other two are bonus movies she probably would never have picked herself but she is enjoying them as well. The DVD arrived damage free new condition. No complaints.
1,So bad I didn't even sell my copy,"O'Connell is a well respected name in military history. This book is so one sided and flawed that I felt I needed to keep my copy not sell it to a used bookshop, so that others without the access to more balanced histories and references wouldn't purchase it and think that it represents anything resemebling a correct analysis of the history of gun armed capital ships in the USN. Others have already cataloged the plethora of technical errors in this work. I can only agree with them. I am adding my voice here simply in the hope that readers will steer clear of this and seek better written and more honest works."
2,A persual indicates that at least 15% is from McNeal's book,"I read the book with interest and found that a major portion, including its title, it taken from James McNeal's two books, Children as Consumers, and Kids as Customers.Most of the remainder is taken from other sources. Thus, originality is not its long suit."
2,"Good transmitter, bad charger","This product transmits great, but it won't work as a charger for my sansa e250."
1,"Nice Idea, but...","I really liked the idea behind this product. Looked like it would solve a space problem in my Vette. Unfortunately it was DOA - would not power on. The replacement was also dead. Perhaps there was a bad batch. The third time may have been a charm, but I decided to go with a standard Griffin product. It worked the first time."
2,Broke within the first month,"I decided on this item because I liked the idea of putting it in my cup holder and not having to worry about where to place my Sansa E250. The MP3 player will sit nicely in the holder if you don't have a case on it, but I purchased the Speck ToughSkin which makes the player thicker. Luckily you can pull off a cheap plastic template piece and still use it with a case, but it won't hold it very securely and it would pop off once in a while when I hit a big bump. This thing worked great for a few weeks, great sound. Then one day I tried to turn it on and it wouldn't power on. I checked all the plugs, but it still wouldn't work. I sent it back and am going to try the FM transmitter from Maximo. I probably just got a dud, but they lost my trust."
1,Wound't even turn on,"Fit in the cup holder nice and secure. Unfortunately it wouldn't even turn on, even though the plug lit up indicating there was power available. Sent back for refund"
3,Good product for the most part.,"I bought this due to the reviews I read on it and for the most part it's good. It was very easy to set up in the car and charges the MP3 player as well, which is great. My only issue is the connection with the mp3 player cuts out sometimes and I have to play with it. It's also something you have to set up (the songlist, etc.) before you start driving due to the small buttons and connection sensativity issue. Overall, the product is nice, compact, and convenient for it's purpose."
1,Macally FM Cup Transmitter and Charger for MP3 Players,"I have a RCA Opal MP3 Player which I bought on Amazon. On the Amazon page for my MP3 player there is a listing called ""Buy This Product and Related Accessories"". This Macally charger/transmitter was listed under ""chargers"". The Macally may well work for the sansa but it does not charge the opal and it doesn't even hold the opal. Amazon should not reference the Macally on the Opal page- it is not a reasonable match. I am disappointed."
5,Charger/Transmitter for Sansa,"The spring loaded ""arms"" for securing the unit in the console drink holder work great. I'm able to use it in several different size consoles. I like having a large spectrum of FM channel choices. The fidelity is good with no noticeable distortion. My only criticism is that I have to remove the unit from the console in order to use the Sansa's front menu-select buttons. Am I glad I bought it? You bet! Would I recommend to a friend? I already have--several times!"
3,Works but not perfectly,This transmitter does exactly what it claims to. It will broadcast music on your sansa to the radio. However the volume is somewhat low even with the sansa turned to max. Also there is static often and choosing a good clear channel is tricky.These complaints probably apply to most fm transmitters so other than that this is a well built and convenient product.
1,BEWARE - EVERY TOON HAS BIG UGLY COMPANY LOGO,"What a disappointment - EVERY cartoon in this collection has a BIG, UGLY yellow-orange ""MILL CREEK ENTERTAINMENT"" LOGO slapped on it! Adding to insult is the fact that some entries (Cobweb Hotel, for example) are so poorly recorded as to be unwatchable: blocky artifacts, flashing, focus problems and more. I threw mine in the trash and will NEVER buy a Mill Creek disc again, ever."
3,No Betty Boop,"I bought this for the 'Cobweb Hotel' and wasn't disappointed in that part of it. My disappointment came when I was going to show the Betty Boop cartoons to my granddaughter...that disc was defective & unreadable. It was new & sealed. That gives me the message that 'new' doesn't always mean 'without defects', so buyers beware."
2,Watermarked and cropped to letterbox (4:3),"Some of the films are watermarked with an ugly logo (imo a sacrilege). Also all films have been chopped and cropped to fit the standard 4:3 letterbox-TV.I find the selection of films a little strange. Wasn't this supposed to be classics? Of course Betty Boop and Popye can be called classics, but there's some obscure stuff in there, including clay animations(!). Early clay animations may of course be of interest to many, but it was certainly not something I expected, and I don't think you can call the clay animations *cartoon* classics."
1,rodneyb,"man,this is ia bad(spelled B*A*D!!!)collection.save yourself some money and please don't get this...you've been warned."
4,good shoe a little large in sizing,I think the shoe is great quality for the price. I did think the shoe size is larger than what it says. I ordered a 10.5 and sent them back because they were a size too big. I got a smaller size the they were still a little large but still fit. I still think they are a good shoe for the price.
4,Zero: an investigation into 9/11,Very well done. I have several videos on this topic and I would rate this one of the better ones.
5,Great documentary !,"I consider this film to be the most professional documentary ever made about 9/11. It is very artistic, well directed, very good picture and demonstration ""specially when it comes to the planes"" which makes you feel good that talented artists started to pay attention to such horrific event. It interviews scientists, pilots, politicians plus a noble prize winner who plays a main character throughout the documentary. Worth the money!"
2,Faith No More's most malacious....,"The first, and worst of Faith No More's albums; Highly over priced by Amazon.com."
2,100 bucks?,"Why in the hell is it 100 bucks for a brand new copy of this CD? This album is average at best, and all of the songs worth a damn sound 10million times better when Patton sings them. I understand the concept of rarity, but seriously, if you wanna pay for something rare, at least make sure it's quality. 100bucks?!?! 60bucks used?!?! How do these people sleep at night?"
2,The Egg is not the best Shiner Album by a long shot!!!!,"I was a Shiner fan for years and Lula Divinia, hands down, was the best Shiner album, period. No debate, it just was. Why people praise The Egg so much is bizarre to me. However, The Egg does have some interesting moments. Allen's vocals are always amazing. The man can simply sing. Paul's bass work is a little muted and reserved here but still comes down as the backbone of the bands epic rock sound. The best song on the disc is the instrumental song that comes right after the song The Egg. That's sad that the best song is an instrumental. Listening to the rest of Shiner's album's and then buying The Egg when it first came out was dissapointing. The Egg just sounded to me like a band running out of musical ideas. Allen's new band The Life and Times is even far better then The Egg. Buy Lula Divinia, it is the best Shiner album and looms way above this sub-par album"
5,Reegged.,"This is a re-review of this album. THE EGG is the kind of CD you must listen to numerous times to let the coolness of it saturate your soul. SHINER is a great band that rocks. My previous review stated that they were okay and this disc was just average. After listening a few more times I've come to the conclusion that the CD and the band are really creative. THE EGG has excellent drumming, great guitar and bass, and Allen Eply's voice seems to make it's way into your head with it's smooth catchiness. I will surely check out the other releases in SHINER's arsenal now that I've discovered what I was missing in the first few listens. Maybe SHINER is so good my brain got a little scrambled by THE EGG."
3,"Interesting life, less interesting book","I was curious about Lynda's life and picked up this book to read on an airplane ride.Very poorly written, it took me 4 months to finally finish it. I wasn't captivated and brought into her world, as the cover suggested. I didn't feel much for this self-pitying, lowly writer."
4,Couldn't put it down!,"I met Lynda at a book signing and bought her book. I stayed up the whole night reading about her life and couldn't put it down. This true story reads like a movie. My only criticism is that it isn't well written. I wish Lynda had a better editor, but maybe they wanted this to sound like she wrote it herself...which she did!"
3,On the inside,"Having been on the inside I could relate to this one. Rita Schiano, author ""Painting The Invisible Man""Painting the Invisible Man"
2,Not great but something to read to pass time.,"Ok. I read lots of books about LCN and this one so far was the worst. It was poorly written. I know she tried to make the book sound very personal but it just came off that she threw this thing together. Then at the end she says it took her three years to complete this? I could have written her story in less time. The funny thing is, she had help. Ugh!!! It is so repetitive I got tired of reading the same words over and over again. She contradicts herself all the time and constantly goes into self pity.Truth is, everything she says is absolutely taken with skepticism because she even says she picked up things in bits in pieces (the life, that is). She just put stuff together in her mind from certain things that may have overheard, saw, etc.If they make a movie out of this one it will have to be pretty cheesy. If you're a mafia fan, read it just to put a notch on the booklist. Otherwise, skip it."
1,"Whine, Whine, Whine","This is a book about a whiner with grammar issues. In fact, she whines so much, her book gave me a headache. Her mother hated her, she hated school,she has no friends, her husband beat her, her husband was a criminal...whine whine whine. This could all be fascinating stuff, but because she whines instead of telling a story, it's boring. You just know the reason she has no friends is because no one wants to hear about it all the time.I have no sympathy for this woman. All she did was make bad choices. I can't figure out if the purpose of this book was a bid for sympathy or to complain about Sammy Gravano, who, for all his faults, seemed to find a better writer, as well as editor, for his own book. Her throughts are convoluted, out of sequence and I doubt she's as innocent as tries to appear.Skip this book or get it from the library. Even though I only paid fifty cents, I still feel like I wasted money."
1,Disappointing,"This book was extremely disappointing. The first quarter of the book was filled with boring trivial facts about her younger years (pre-Louie) time. The only information she gives about her husband being a hit man is NOT from personal experiences but from passages written in Sammy Gravano's biography and newspapers. The author seemed to have a vendetta against her family and continued to complain about her family and how hard life is for her. ""Woe is me""....please!"
1,Who put their name on this book as an editor??!!!!,"Oh man.I picked this book up on vacation, intending it to be a good read...if anything something to pass the time. I have a huge interest in the Mafia and have for quite some time....however this book blew it for me. I don't think I made it past page 50...in fact I think I read the first 50 pages half a dozen times. I couldn't believe how poorly this book was written!! On top of that, like others have stated, it was so repetitive! I was shocked to say the least. I believe there to be many ways to have a book sound very much like the author, despite the authors ability to write a book, which clearly was not done with this book!!"
5,Cordelia Gray does her thing!!!,"I have listened to this dramatization several times since purchasing it in 1990 and have enjoyed this atomsopheric suspense mystery immensely. P.D. James ability to give all her characters faults, insecurities, and occasional selfishness once again serves her well in this mystery. The characters are as developed as possible in the space of a 3 hour radio play. The atmosphere created on the island is just incredible, spooky, and just what you would expect in that setting. The character of Cordelia Gray is very well developed over the course of this story and her other adventure, ""An Unsuitable Job For a Woman."" I consider these two stories to be my favorite P.D. James mysteries. I strongly recommend these to all P.D. Jmaes fans as cracking good yarns and very entertaining."
4,not bad,"As of late I've tried a bunch of workout videos and as much as Tracey Mallet has the most annoying voice ever..this one is good. She keeps you going. Of course, like any video you wanna kill her 1/2 way through, but the 3 15min workouts really kick your bum...it's good for legs and arms!"
2,a bit brief,"While I do like the concept of Cardio Boot Camp and I do enjoy the enthusiasm of Tracey Mallett and her moves, I believe this workout with it's 3 brief segments, doesn't give ample time for a real workout. I find myself fast forwarding through the warmup of the following section in order to maintain the momentum of the cardio intensity. A much longer cardio routine, with less segments would work great. The other drawback of this video, is the warmup and especially the cooldown section, is almost non-existant. These things are crucial, especially for a beginning exerciser, who doesn't know what to incorporate to bring the heartrate down when the cardio section is through. These few additions would make this video good. I do like Tracey's combinations and she keeps you psyched throughout."
3,Look for a different workout,"I do this video 1 or 2 times/week on the days that I do not do Crunch Yoga DVD (Fat-Burning Yoga and Joy of Yoga), Minna Optimizer-Balanced Blend DVD(Fat Eliminator and Strength and Grace) or acutal Yoga class. Suggestions when buying this workout include:1. Watch the entire DVD before working out. The instructor gives NO instructions, so you have to watch the DVD closely to get the moves down.2. Warm-up, cooldown and stretch on your own as this DVD does not go through any of the necessary tools for a complete workout.2. Turn the sound off. The music is cool, but the instructor is not. She's a hyperactive combo of Twiggy and Olivia Newton-John.3. Do all 3 workouts. The 1st and 3rd sections are about 15 minutes each, but the 2nd section is only about 11 or 12 minutes. Section 3 is a combo of sections 1 and 2.I've read other people's reviews here and am hoping that Crunch Boot Camp will be available on DVD soon."
3,A good addition,"I generally go the gym most days a week, and use the elliptical and/or treadmill, and some of the weight machines.I use videos to add a little variety or whatever into my exercise.This is an okay video. It's fun to do, but it probably won't give you huge results on its own.I don't think that it ever really gets your heart rate up, so I doubt it will burn much fat. The choreography is kind of confusing, so the first couple (or more than a couple because I'm so uncoordinated) of times I did the tape, I couldn't do anything on the first try, and by the time I got the hang of it, it was time to go on to another move.The instructor is really energenic, but I think that's what a good instructor should be.I like watching the guy behind her, because he's so muscular and fit and everything, but he has horrible balance, and it seems he and I have similar coordination.This is a good video to burn a couple of extra calories, and to work a little bit harder on your muscles."
3,Not for advanced exercisers,"This workout is good.... but not very challenging if you are in shape to begin with. She is adorable, though!"
4,Be ready to sweat,"This workout is not for the weak at heart, or knees or any other body part. It will make you sweat. Not recommended for beginners. And I would watch it once all the way through before attempting the exercise because it moves very fast."
1,Junk!,This workout has no warmup and no cooldown. It's the worst workout I've ever bought. I actually threw it in the trash.
2,Not a fan,"I bought this video, and did the work out for a few months. I don't really like the way that the sets are layed out. There are several sets, with a cool down after each. One set is too short, and if you want to do two you have to fast forward through the cool down and the warm up to get going again.My biggest problem with this video is the crazed Aussie instructor. I can put up with almost any aerobics instructor, but she really really grated on me. I have done all kinds of videos, and liked this one probably the least, because mostly of her.One funny side note. There is a big out of place guy in the back that never keeps up, and is usually dancing to his own beat. That was the hilight of the video for me."
4,Never gets boring...,"As a Tae Bo fan, I was a little apprehensive in purchasing this video, thinking it would have complicated, too-fast-paced dance-type moves and that I would lose interest. I was wrong--these three, 15-minutes-each workouts are tough, yet easy to add together for a full workout. Tracey Mallet is very energizing, yet not annoying, and the workouts are great for cardio/kickboxing benefits. The middle workout includes a segment using weights (interval training), although I was disappointed it had only the one segment, after which the weights were not used again. I grasped the moves of the workouts on only the second time around which made it easier to enjoy. This tape has three great workouts, whether you do one or more than one. I would highly recommend it."
3,"An OK workout, but not my favorite.","While this tape will get your heart rate up with the ""power"" moves and fast pace, the name doesn't quite fit what I was expecting. Probably should be called something more along the lines of ""Cardio Dance Camp with a Hint of Marching""!The instructor is cool, but the awkward guy in the back that everyone in these reviews talks about ruins the mood completely. It's all I could do not to fall over laughing.It does get three stars for providing a decent cardio workout, so if you like dance moves incorporated into your routine, then by all means this is your tape!"
4,"It's a little ""jumpy"" for my tastes, but...","I definitely feel like I've had a workout after doing a couple segments of this tape. I like these workouts that are broken up into 15- or 20-minute chunks at a time. It's really easy to fit exercising into a real-life schedule that way. Tracey seems to be a little over-the-top at first, but if she can endear herself to me, she can probably endear herself to anyone.Because this workout is certainly high-impact, I don't really like to do it too often---mainly when I'm feeling like I've been super-lazy and not exercised enough.P.S. If you have Kathy Smith's Latin Sizzle Workout, look closely at the blonde just over Kathy's shoulder in the big group shots---Tracey's the one in the white top shakin' and breakin' her butt! That's what she's like on this video, too."
2,Cardio Boot Camp,I was excited at first when I found this video. I was in the military and really got in great shape at boot camp. I was disappointed though. It wasn't very motivating at all and became boring very quickly. It turned out to be not much of a challenge. I probably won't ever watch it again.
3,Need to do this a few times,I hated this the first time I did it but boredom finally forced me into dragging it out again and I must admit that some of the moves are challenging. I like her use of plyometrics. Some stuff is just too dorky and her constant babble is irritating but this is not a bad video for the money. It definately is good to mix in with other sorts of workouts. Tracy Mallett looks great and it is hard to argue with results!
1,Dorky guy alert!,"This video is horrible! The instructor is SO incredibly annoying and theres this dorky guy in the back who is totally out of step and just does whatever the heck he wants. If you want a laugh, then buy it and watch this guy, otherwise, get something else!"
1,POOR WORKOUT VIDEO!,"I actually bought this because I thought it was what it said ""Basic Training"". Of Course, I was thinking military and it has virtually NO excerises that soliders in the military do. I found the instructer VERY annoying! My husband is in the military and he said it was a very poor excuses for excersise tape. And for the men to be wearing BDU workout suits is beyond hillarous.......TWO THUMBS DOWN FOR THIS ONE!!!!"
5,The book on editing,Every time I reread a section of this book I learn somthing new about editing my fiction.The author convinced me early that he know what he was talking about and the conviction stayed throughout. It seems clear that he applied every single one of his editing maxims to the work itself. Practicing what he preaches.Having first read copy from the library I immediately ordered my own and have re read most of it several times. I have no doubt that it will be read through many more times before I have absorbed all of the wisdom it contains
3,"Good content, poor book design","Before I bought the book I saw a review that complained about the type size and page layout, and I thought that the reviewer was just nitpicking. BUT it turned out that the book's design DOES make it very hard to read. Other good choices that don't have this setback are Wm. Zinsser's On Writing Well and Sol Stein's Stein on Writing."
4,User Friendly for writers,"I found this easy to use, with good ideas. I would suggest only getting after your first few drafts, when you've finished with plot and structure. Most of his advice would be useful when tidying up your manuscript at the end.I'd read this again."
2,Words Right Print Wrong,"This book is difficult to read. Period. The type is too small and the print is brown. The author presents basic rules of writing, but is wordy himself,a bit pretentious. It would appeal to the older learner, but older eyes cannot read the print. It's a decent book butI think Sol Stein does a better job."
5,Great Classic Combo,How can it get any better. Two classic movies for one low price. My 4 year old daughter watches these movies over and over again. I really enjoy watching them with her. Beats the heck out of watching the Wiggles and Barney.
4,Poetic songs without words!!!,These songs without words are rendered beautifully by Peter Nagy.These piano pieces of Mendelssohn are truly charming and Nagy brings out the dreamy ethereal character with a lyrical and sensitive touch.Just listen to these pieces in the quiet of the Night!Recommended.
5,Arguably Yvonne Elliman's Best Album,I had this album when it first came out on vinyl in 1973 but my Mom gave it away when I re-located. I beleive that this was Yvonne's best album; it showcased her voice and range beautifully. She was the most underrated singer of the 70's. It was woderful to hear this album again after so long; it brought back pleasant memories of my youth when life was simple and uncomplicated.
2,Not recommended for long-term use,"The first one was broken and the automatic rocking would never work, so we purchased the same one again because I really liked how it looked and hoped the broken one was just a fluke. It's just kind of a pathetic swing overall. It's cute and very attractive, but not very functionally sound. Our baby had to stop using this swing at 6 months because he was starting to reach out and grab the legs and pull the swing to the side. Obviously the swing doesn't work right after that point. Also, the seat is just too small. My baby's feet were hanging over the front much sooner than they should have and he just appeared to be too big for it even at 4 months. We got a lot of good use out of it from newborn to 4 months before we realized it wasn't gonna work for us any longer. I wouldn't purchase this again if I had another baby."
5,Emerging Jazz Star,"Peter Eldridge's debut jazz outing is one one the most refreshing and inviting discs to emerge from the vocal jazz world in a very long time.Eldridge's ecnomical style and impeccable phrasing are put to good use on these thoughtful arrangements of Rodgers and Hart,Jobim,Dameron, and more.Also a great use of an all star cast of the jazz elite including Michael Brecker, Claudio Roditti and Lewis Nash.I can't wait to see what is in store for jazz lovers next with this young vocal giant.--Lee Wurtsal The Jazz Advocate"
5,A refreshing new jazz albumn,"If you're a fan of Peter Eldridge, make sure to pick up a copy of Sranger in town; you won't be dissapointed! If you've never experienced Peter's soothing voice , then you're in for a real treat. This CD is done very tastefully, and it includes jazz giants such as Lewis Nash, David Finck, and Andy Ezrin. I first heard of Peter Eldridge when I saw him accompany Jane Monheit on her DVD, Live at the Rainbow Room. Along with Jane Monheit, Peter Eldridge is one of the most exciting new talents to emerge. Also, look for Peter on his New York Voices albumns."
5,LOVED THE COVER,"The cover definitely grabs you. Joe DiMaggio has a ""mystique"" look to him. I truly enjoyed the book and would highly recommend it."
5,tHE mISSING Bat,I re read the book and I still don't know who took Al Rosen's bat. Does any one know who took the bat?If you do let me know. Thanks. The story about Jackie Robinson was great.He was a very thouhtful man. I SAW dIMAGGIO IN A NEW LIGHT.I LIKED THAT HE KEPT HIS PROMISE.This was a very inspirational book. I loved it.
5,The Promise,"joe dimaggio: the promise was a great book. the author draws you back to a time when baseball was at a zenith and truly became the national past time. aside from the historical players like williams, robinson, dimaggio; there is a young boy, joe, who becomes the yankee batboy. because he was part of the yankee family, it provided him with an opportunity to talk to some of the greatest ballplayers of that time. he not only sets out on a personal endeavor to learn what makes great players so great. those true lessons of life, cultivate him into the person he is now."
5,A Great Book For A Young Reader,I was very happy to read about Joe Dimaggio. My grandfather always talks about Joe Dimaggio and when i read the book now i know why Dimaggio was so famous. This book should be read by all young peeople so they can know about a basesball here. I am going to read this book again . I liked the story about the bat and find out who got the bat. I also liked brother columbo-he was great.
5,"Timeless Works, Great Performance, Great Value","Pianist, Jeno Jando, recording for the Naxos label, offers spirited performances of his recorded work of Mozart's and Haydn's piano sonatas. The recording quality is clear and natural. The interpretation is honest and spirited. Naxos recordings are less expensive than most mid-line recordings by the well-established labels. They capitalize on finding top notch soloists and ensembles from Eastern Europe who are beginning to develop a world audience after the fall of the Iron Curtain.Select the volumes which have your favorite Mozart sonatas, sitback, and enjoy! You won't be disappointed."
5,GREAT COMPILATION OF HIS EARLY SOLO WORK!,"This CD features 18 songs from John Foxx's first three albums after leaving Ultravox: Metamatic, The Golden Section and In Mysterious Ways. It includes classics like Europe After The Rain, Sitting At The Edge Of The World and Morning Glory. -- A great disappointment that some fantastic tracks did not make it on this CD. These songs are very rich in detail of electronic instruments and lyrics. He stands alone in this kind of music. Any material from this talented artist is worth getting. Very difficult to find I might add, especially in the U. S. I have six of his CDs and still struggling to get more. His work is worth every penny I've spent. He is a real pleasure and a great way to escape the boring pop music that surrounds us."
4,A solid performance of familar music,"To put my only complaint first, there is no English translation of the text. How much that matters you must determine for yourself.However, the notes on the music are excellent. I had not known that the six cantatas constituting the oratorio were intended to be sung on separate days: Christmas, the day after Christmas, the third day of Christmas, the Feast of the Circumcision, first Sunday of the new year, and the Feast of Epiphany. That places the music clearly in the category of Christmas (not Advent) music.The music is typical Bach - strings, organ, flutes, oboes, brass . . . but it is some of the best of Bach. You will find several of the pieces familar although you may not have associated them with the oratorio e.g. the 5th track on the first cd - Wie soll ich dich empfangen.The performance by the Hungarian Radio Choir and the Failoni Chamber Orchestra is excellent. Add this to your list of very enjoyable Christmas music."
2,Lawrence Welk with banjos,"I know Roy Clark is an icon in the country music world, and I was really looking forward to hearing some good old fashioned country and bluegrass music, but I really didn't get that on this album. Most of the songs on this compilation reminded me of the songs I'd hear at the dentist's office when I was a kid: soothing Big Band era melodies played by a string quartet at a slower than normal tempo in order to put the waiting patients into a tranquil mood. Maybe Roy Clark is well deserving of his legendary status in country music, but this album doesn't help me understand why."
4,Really the Very Best,"The songs in this album really are the very best of Roy Clark, in my opinion. If you only have one Roy Clark album in your collection, it should be this one."
4,moving account of a terrible disease,"What an honest and moving account about love and dedication between two people who are savaged by this terrible disease. They inspire so much love and passion in others. I can recommend this book to anyone, even those who have nothing to do with Parkinson's disease."
5,Honesty - Empathy - Love - Parkinson's (HELP),"The acronym HELP is because reading this book can do nothing but help us find a cure for Parkinson's. I read the book cover-to-cover the first day I received it! Unless one has PD (as I do), unless one has had brain surgery (as I did), and unless one has seen the difference made in marriage, spiritual focus, relationships, and lifestyle; the impact this book will have cannot be appreciated. Mort Kondrake has poured out his heart and soul in this writing - the good and the bad - in order to offer a candidly honest picture of what a chronic illness does to a family and marriage.Kondrake tells how he juggles his wife's needs, his career, and his love as he helplessly watches her waste away. All we need now in the literary world is a book written by someone who doesn't do everything in his/her power to alter a loved one's destined course in living with a chronic illness."
3,"I wanted more of Milly, not Morton","While this book was interesting, I feel it was written with outenough Milly in it. We got great detail of Morton's efforts,but very little of day to day coping by Milly, or by herdaughters. I also feel the book leaves out the most importantpart of the story, how does Milly and her familiy deal with,or help manage her death. Since Milly is still alive, this bookis unfinished. Having a disease that you know will kill you inchby inch, with your loosing your ability to communicate must beterrifying. My main concern would be what my death will entail, how I handled it, and how my family moved on..."
5,AWESOME!!!,I have had this for 6 years now and it is still in awesome condition!!!Great toy!!!! The dalmation is really cute!!
1,Littlest Pet Shop...Biggest disappointment,"The Little Lovin' Playhouse playset from the Littlest Pet Shop toy line was a huge disappointment and awaiting return to the store. I love the little pet shop pets, however this playhouse did not make it 5 min without the hamster getting stuck in the tube on top. The tube also keeps coming apart as well as the lid popping off. Not very well constructed for children to play with. After popping the parts on and off the first 30 or 40 times it just starts to look like junk.I was really hoping for better, but I am returning it and probably will think twice about the line of playhouses that go with these pets."
3,"Daughter loves it, but questionable durability...","My daughter (3 years old) was absolutely ecstatic when she received this toy. From the description, I thought this would be something that when closed my daughter would be able to easily take with her when traveling but that's not really the case. Yes, the toy does close but there is no mechanism or latch to keep it closed so the doors just swing back open if you try to carry it. Also, all the pieces do not fit inside of the toy as I had thought they would.From day one I've had to put parts of the toy back together. The hamster tube seems to constantly be pulling apart at the seams and I don't really expect this toy to last past several months. That being said, it was not all that expensive and my daughter is having a lot of fun with it. Parents beware...once you purchase your child's first LPS toy you will forever be buying more and more to go with it, they seem to be addictive."
5,Great playset,"I love the littlest pet shop! I am 12 years old but i cant help but loving them! This one is the best! It comes with a hamster and a dog, but the hamster has a tube it rides through, ( really easy to use by the way ) and most pets can fit in the hamster wheel. THis one is really fun and alot of secret nicnacks. Excample: when there paw touches the fire hidrint, a bed pops out. THe toybox too! It comes with 2 teddy bears, a rope,a fish, hamster wheel, food bowl, and plenty of fun! i give this 5 stars! just one more thing. it has MANY small pieces so if your child is really young, i suggest watching them becuase it has many choakable parts. thanks for reading my review!! =D krissy"
2,Nowhere as good as the original LPS,"I have always loved the old littlest pet shops. They were made well and none of mine ever broke. These, however are a totally different story. Before I could even get it out of the package, the hamster tube's door fell off, and so did the front door.And in very little time, the dog's head popped off. The door to the hamster's tube falls off every few minutes, and it's really annoying. Unless you want to spent half the time you play with it reassembling it, don't buy this toy! BRING BACK THE OLD LPS!!"
3,My daughter loves it; I hate it,"I hate to take it away from her to return it, but that's what I plan to do. She absolutely loves playing with it, and even though it's only $20, I don't feel the quality is remotely worth the money. The fold-down doggie bed constantly falls off, the swinging door comes apart and the hamster tube has come apart. This after only 3 days of playing with it - and she's gentle. They've got the right idea because, seriously, it entertains her for hours, but I'm sick of constantly hearing ""Oh no, it broke again."""
5,Great toy for all ages.,"I purchased this for my 2 1/2 year old. She loves all her little animals. My 4 year old likes it as well. We do have problems with the door falling off, but it doesn't compare to the enjoyment my children have."
5,Off we go into theWild Blue Yonder.,"Being a former military pilot and having had most of the same experiences, once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down till I had finished the book. He did a great job of describing the trials and tribulations of an Aviation Cadet and the life of a military pilot after graduation. His use of words is excellentI would recommend this book to any one with an interest in flying or is interested in experiencing what military pilots went through, in training and beyond, during WWII.Great book"
5,Top Stick: With Some Help From a Guardian Angel,"Top Stick is a book you can't put down once you starting reading it - very interesting from beginning to end. This is a story of a man with integrity who is determined to reach his goal/dream of a career as an Air Force pilot. I highly recommend this book, as it is enjoyable reading for everyone."
4,club covers,Service was good and product arrived ok. Product seems good but haven't had a chance to use them yet.
5,"""Pilates for Wimps"" rules!","I really enjoyed Ms. DeLuca's approach to Pilates, and have no doubt that ""Pilates for Wimps"" will provide the necessary insights and information for a whole new generation of Pilates practitioners!"
2,Lots of fun until they break,"If you have children under 12 hitting, these balls may last a few weeks. If you have kids over 12 swinging at these balls, they will last a matter of pitches. Basically the red ring cracks very easily and then the ball is too light and doesn't work as well."
1,disappointed,"Fujitronic FR-803 4-Cup Rice CookerAfter having researched rice cookers and having chosen another brand, I made an impulsive change to buy this one, based on another consumer's review.This model does not self-adjust for different types of rice. Some types burn and stick to the bottom. Some remain excessively moist. Discovering the proper amount of water for each type of rice is experimental.The cooker cover does not remove for cleaning. Cleaning is difficult around the rim, at the hinge, and for the inside cover.This model does not include a steamer basket.I would not choose this product again."
5,Great Book,This book finally arrived and I so happy to have a copy. It is a beautiful tribute to Central Park and the avian population of permanent and transient birds. It is currently out of print so I am grateful to Amazon for the opportunity to get it. Any former New Yorker will appreciate this visual trip back home.
3,Think carefully before buying this album,"This is an OK album, but it's not great. Anyone who's bought Sunday 8pm can tell you that Faithless can do SOOOO much better than this. If you want to buy this record, think twice about it - the best songs on the album (Insomnia, Salva Mea, Reverence) are all singles anyway, and the singles have all the best mixes. The double-CD version of Reverence (with bonus remix disc 'Irreverence') is worth checking out, but otherwise save your money, because it just isn't worth it."
3,Proceed with caution,"I have to second all that Chris Brampton geezer said. The good songs are singles, the rest remind me of weed-obsessed crusties sat around together at a festy party, liking the album just because everyone else does. Maybe I'm too narrowminded! Sorry to be a chart-groupie, but 'Insomnia' absolutely rocked. Don't make the same mistake I did by assuming that every song will be an 'Insomnia', it's not like that."
4,"A wonderful blend of techno, dance, rap and smooth sounds","After hearing the much-played single ""insomnia"" I purchased Faithless's album and was very pleased it. I found a longer, cooler version of their popular single great along with nine other awesome tracks. Each song has its own style, but they all share the same smooth rhythms and addictive beats. The opening track is especially catchy with Maxi Jazz's (a lead singer) rap nearly hypnotizing you. Don't be mislead, though - this is not a rap album. Each song has a unique feel and there are at least three distinct vocalists which make for a very exciting album. I would recommend this album to fans of Enigma, Enya, Hooverphonic and Madonna's Ray of Light album. You won't be disappointed!"
3,inferior to no roots.,"i like faithless. for me, their music represents a very cool and well-executed blend of hiphop and electronica. however, this album seems to peak at the first song, G.O.D., a master track, and then slant slowly downhill thereafter. i am all for experimentation, but feel a lot of these songs miss the mark. as a better choice, i would go with faithless' earlier album, no roots, which is solid and lyrically beautiful the whole way through."
1,False Teacher,Mark T Barclay is a false teacher with incorrect exegesis of the bible. I have been through his courses at SMTI and can tell you that by first had experience. He is not orthodox and doesn't care anything about protestant christianity.
3,More for historians than audiophiles,"This recording was done in 1941 when Virgil Fox was 29 years old. You will find some of the pieces on here which were to become synonymous with Fox, such as ""Come, Sweet Death"" and ""Thou Art the Rock."" If you are a Fox fan, a fan of Aeolian-Skinner organs, or have an interest in older recordings, then you might consider this CD essential to your collection. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it since it sounds like it was recorded with a mic as far away from the organ as possible. This results in too much ambience and really cuts down on the dynamics."
5,Great bag!,"I use this bag for EVERYTHING! I got it for school, to hold my textbooks and binders while I rode my motorcycle. It works great. There's pockets for everything, and half of them are water-proof while others are water-resistant. It holds... a rediculous amount of stuff. I have yet to put my helmet in it, but I know it'll fit and then some. I've already recommended it to friends, and I would recommend it to you... even if you don't ride a motorcycle!For the record... I have YET to fill this sucker up... and I've carried... about 50 lbs worth of textbooks/school supplies in it a few times. Its like a friggin' Marine. It wants more s**t to go through."
4,Backpack,"Nice backpack for compartments. Pockets are most useful for first aid kit, gameboy, mp3 player, and a water bottle. However the long side pocket is not long enough for a better umbrella. Laptop compartment can be improved with a little more back padding and a better strap to hold the laptop in, because the side zipper is not that secure.Additional button or velcro flap would have made it more secure.First thing i did, was remove the Ogio label in the back, used an xacto knife and cut the stitches. And sewed on a patch that I like."
4,"Overall, Well Done","The playing on this CD is not only technically brilliant, it's on the quicker side of the expected tempo range. Szokolay's comprehension of the music is such that he can deliver dynamic, rapid performances while still retaining the clarity of each individual note. My only complaint is that, as others have noted, these performances are somewhat lacking in feeling. Granted, there's a difference between the emotional content of a Clementi sonatina and a Beethoven sonata, but these pieces are all extremely well-crafted works by a minor master, and they do indeed have their passionate moments. It would have been nice to have more emphasis placed on these emotional spots. That's a small flaw, however, in an otherwise brilliantly-played collection of well-written music. I still admire Clementi's tuneful melodies and artistic balance (""Mozart Lite,"" one might say), and the playing on this CD, while somewhat flat, does nothing to deter me from that opinion overall."
3,Helpful Hints,Enjoyed this book for the helpful hints it provided. From morning sickness and make-up to sex it covered all the bases in an easy to read and fun way.
3,"ok, not comparable to the first.","This movie lacked the warmth and heart of the previous Wind in the Willows, which is one of my all time favorites. It was a bit disappointing, but it was nice to hear the original cast (= All in all, it was a fairly cute movie when you don't look at it as a follow up to the original."
4,Mom of 2,This is a roomy and durable toy box. It comes all put together which is wonderful! It has lots of room with two extra bins. I recommend this to any one with young children.
2,Cheaply made,"I was expecting a better quality toy box. I was unhappy when we found out the top lid does not fit in. What I mean is that if you have too many toys in the chest, the top will fall off, because it does not lock in anywhere. We thought the bottom 2 drawers rolled out, but they do not. If you have hard wood floors (as we do), the drawers will scratch floor. It is spacious, but thats the only thing going for this toy box flop."
1,Muted Sound,"Recently purchased this docking station and then returned it. Connected it to my stereo system and got very muted sound output. Turned up volume on stereo and got distorted sound. Connection to stereo system is through the earphone jack on the ipod, which results in muted sound. The method of connection is not shown in the photo or within the specifications posted on Amazon. If looking for ipod docking station to connect to stereo system, recommend that one should look for docking station that provides sound output through the base connection of the ipod for full line output. I would not give it any stars."
4,Works great,I just dont know if its my computer but every now and then it looses signal with my comp. and i have disconnect it and start all over again
1,Volume didn't work,"Volume control didn't work with they Keyspan remote, the main reason I bought it. Don't order this product."
1,Waste of Money,What a piece of garbage! I purchased an S-Video cable and thought that I could connect via my VCR. I can seem to do that and none of my TV's have an S-video connector on them -- and they are fairly new! I called Keyspan support and the person said if I don't have an S- video on the TV I am out of luck. I am going to try Radio Shack to see if there is an S-Video to RCA converter. This is a severe disappointment!
3,"Good photos and displays, not so good text.","The book's title is ""The advanced guide to floristry"" and it is indeed advanced in their aesthetics, with lots of photos of modern floristry designs.Nevertheless, there is no description of display construction methods, the information upon flower & foliage selection (varieties etc) is scarce, and the text comprises only an overall view of the different displays."
1,apparent fraud,The author made a bunch of money touting his claim that there's no genetic basis in gender identity. This book is part of that campaign. His telling case study later turned out to have been an elaborate charade.
4,Very sensitive,"I found the mic to be sensitive and able to pick up really small sounds. I don't know if it is the case with all mics, but this one picks up noise from lots of electrical devices, AC, phone etc. I did not test the high pass filter much."
2,Not the best place to start on selling real estate,"Tom's sales strategy is a bit dated and probably most applicable in 1960's selling. His tactics are rather phony and disingenuous in soliciting today's educated buyers. Tom's book is all about pretending to be someone you're really not -- a phony, slick, used car salesman strategy. Although this might still work in parts of the U.S. that are still stuck in that era...maybe somewhere in small-town Nebraska. Gary Keller's ""Millionaire Real Estate Agent"" is more marketing-focused and less smiley glad-hand. Marketing is the new paradigm in real estate, not sales. Sorry, Tom. Time to hang it up."
3,Condition of book mislabeled?,"Condition was stated as like new condition with little highlighting. Well there was highlighting and writing all throughout the book. Book was in decent condition, just definitely not like new condition"
4,Bright still shines,"Now quite a dated volume, this short precis by John Bright is still quite helpful as an introduction to some of the issues and themes that still bedevil Old Testament historians and scholars. It is worth the effort to peruse in an afternoon, and I find Bright to be a scholar quite easy to read (which is a compliment) with its short summaries of some of the classic histories of early biblical Israel. Though more than fifty years old now -- I still found it immensely useful and stimulating as an introduction into posing and reflecting upon some of the important questions. I suspect Professor Bright would appreciate this if he were still with us."
3,Oy....,I couldn't even get past the first 50 pages.. dull...I need some chicken soup after this one.
2,Building Classic Antique Furniture With Pine,"This book has some very good projects for the average home workshop, but there are no materials list, only sizes for the various parts, which are incomplete. Some detailed drawings are also non-excistent. Some of the dimensions on the drawings are also inaccurate. Therefore, you must spend some time figuring out exactly how much and the dimensions of the amount of lumber you must purchase. Which can run into multiple trips to the store. Also you must adjust the layout of the part before assembly to account for the inaccuracies in the dimensions of the paticular project you are working on, which is also extra time used unnecessarily."
2,Idea is good but content is short coming.,"Started to build item in Chapter 10, the Dry Sink. Went to use materials lists realized materials list is only half listed. Went to Chapter 12 to the Colonial Washstand, same thing. What a shame. Seems like the book has some great patterns in it but now I don't trust any of it."
1,Poor checking,Yes it has good plans. No they are not sized accurately. You MUST CHECK all dimensions........may the author cut his fingers off! or at least cut them....................
5,Beautiful,"A fabulous album - artistry at the highest level. Very sensitive, nuanced, and impassionate performance by the musicians."
1,Hate them.,"These earphones are horribly designed, the clips that hold them on your ears are so small and tightly curved that I could not wear them. They might fit a very small child but not an average size adult."
2,Product Shell Design is not what was received,Product image is not the design received. The headphones are still the EC-150 model but caution - do not order based on design.
3,Cute table and chairs,"It is a nice set. We did have problems with the chairs, they aren't made very well. But customer service replaced them immediatly. Overall it is worth the money!!"
5,Great Book,"This was an action packed book, great for everyone. I finished it in only a few sittings."
2,"Starts out well, but becomes very flat.","I started reading with such interest, but towards the middle of the book, found it very lacking. Basically, it's a good plot with lots of potential,unfortunatley the author did not follow thru.I do plan to read his new book, though hoping he can take the plot and continue making it meaty enough to hold my interst.sherri_dinnocenzo@yahoo.com"
1,Just awful!,"If there were an option for zero stars, I would have chosen it. I picked up this book from a remainder shelf at a local bookstore chain. I know, I know, my first mistake. What was painfully apparent in only the first five pages is that the book was horrendously edited. For example, the female protagonist is first spotted wearing a ""tea dress"" and Timberland boots, as she meets with two real estate professionals. Yet, in the same scene, she uses the bathroom of what we are led to believe will be her new home and struggles to pull her jeans over her hips after taking a contemplative dump! I gave it only about ten more pages of absolute crap (pun and vulgarity intended), including banal, and, ultimately, pointless sexual references and encounters. Hoorah for Tony Strong! He has the dubious honor of being the author of the first book I have ever thrown away. Folks, don't waste your time or your money."
5,An Wonderful Novel That Touches All of Us,"""Growing up"" is not a question of age, but a continuous struggle towards self-acceptance as well as acceptance of others in all our humanity. It is that humanity that is at the core of ""Twenty-Nine."" Terri Slater invites us to enter her reality and we are immediately engaged in her journey, because it is our journey. I was very impressed by the quality of writing and the humor with which the author treats her subject matter. I highly recommend this book."
1,Feminist Textbook History Lesson,I didn't even finish this book. It seems like it is just a list of facts about woman who have visited Antarctica. I was hoping for more stories than facts. I was very bored. Also the writer appears to be a strong feminist.
3,Suspend your Logic; Improbable Situation,"Just finished Price of Power and did enjoy reading it. The courtroom scenes were my favorite. I felt it was summed up and ended too quickly (I know, I know it was a very long book) because we didn't have a firm take on whether or not the president was left unscathed by his ridiculous delays in taking action and also using congressional time to further his agenda. It was a nice fantasy that a fledgling lawyer would come up with his off the chart theories and even more so that he would be trusted to such an extent. I agree with others it would make a good film."
2,Sloppy spelling,"Overall an excellent read, including abundant opportunities to decipher misspelled words...far lower quality than I've previouslyexperienced with Kindle books."
5,"Begs to be a mini-series on TV, preferably with JAG actors.","Plot, action and love stories intermingled at a fast pace. Writing skills accelerated, so that Mr. Huston grew as an author before our eyes, developing into Wouk-Michener proportions.Characters came alive and the dialog sang, so that the absence of explicit sex and four letter words only became noticeable as an afterthought at the conclusion and redigesting of the two books...James W. Huston will be a writing irresistable force. Can't wait for his next efforts."
4,A Good Book - Worth reading,I enjoyed this book. One criticism though - what self-respecting Admiral would drive a Miata?
1,RIGHT WING FANTASY,"What a lame book. It is at best a weak ripoff of the Clancy novels. Only an idealogue could believe in the preposterous characters.To whit: all conservative and militaristic characters are god-like in their skills at ""warrioring"" and (god forbid) ""lawyering."" It is reason-stretching enough to have a congressional aide discover a ""hidden"" meaning in the Constitution that leads to an unbelievable confrontation between a ""superstar"" Admiral and a pacifistic President; however, when this aide takes on the defense of said Admiral, his angelically pristine paramour actually quits as the Assistant Counsel to the President to offer him aid and comfort. No rational plot line would have such an inexperienced lawyer put on such a bravura performance! The book is a weak entry into the right-wing galaxy of attempts to glorify conservatives and vilify anyone with an opposing thought. My money was wasted on this tripe."
3,Nice Inexpensive Flute,"This is a nice flute, with surprisingly good sound. Note that if you have very small hands, and small fingers, or if this is for a child, the finger holes may be a problem for some. Also, the black bird on top is something of an eyesore, the first thing I did was remove it, and re-wrap that area with a suede leader strip, and add some beads, which definitely improved the looks of the flute.Just keep in mind that this is a plastic flute, it is not going to sound like an expensive wooden flute, with that in mind, it is a bargain."
2,"Pleasant scent?? No, not really, no.","Not only are the fumes put off by this overwhelmingly-strong (if not as harmful as bleach), they last for hours, and, to top things off, it's over-priced and significantly less effective at removing mildew stains vs your typical bleach-containing cleaner. Each time I've used it (2-3 times, and no more), I've been amazed at how strong the odor is. I understand the desire for an effective non-bleach mildew fighter, but this stuff will not be replacing any of those products any time soon as your go-to."
4,"Pretty effective, nice scent","This worked pretty well in getting mold and meldew stains off of a shower curtain, and helping keep them from re-forming. It's not perfect, but it made a big dent in the problem.The best part is the scent. I was using a bleach-based product (or sometimes just diluted bleach) which worked OK (no better or worse than the Damp Rid) but came with a very strong smell of bleach that didn't dissipate for hours after using it. The Damp Rid has a much more pleasant scent. No bleach smell at all nor any heavy fumes. Much easier on the nose while maintaining an acceptable end result."
3,helpful but only for rank beginners,if you've never watched Hold'em on TV then you will find this video helpful but it is way too basic for anyone who has played in a casino or who has played at all in a home game with the exception of the small section on hand odds and pot odds... It is nicely filmed and moves along well but is just too basic
4,The best game ever!,"This game is so cool! You play as Spiderman of course, and just being him and swinging around the sity is awesome. In several levels of this game you get to swing and explore with a pretty big portion of New York City! In several of these cases you get to roam freely throughout the city, or you are chasing or fighting a villan through the skies. Sometimes inside many of the buildings(mostly Green Goblin)or in other levels, you're chasing thugs, battling robots, or stealthly sneaking into buildings, such as oscorp. I might add the second part of that mission nearly gave me a heart attack, trying to avoid security cameras, laserbars, and night guards. If any of these spot you, they will swiftly call out an army of super soldier robots, and I mean swiftly! Overall, this game is really fun. A few levels can be frustrating, but once you solve them they are even more fun. The graphics were very surprising, and many of them were better than those on more recent games."
4,Good Read,"This is another good Oppenheim story. Transparent at times but thoroughly enjoyable. Not his usual adventure novel but full of adventure anyway. A few too many unanswered questions this time but still an enthralling read. Mysterious pasts, lonely castle, family secrets, evil adventurers, dissolute youths, disguises and madness...a little of everything, including lovely ladies."
3,great sound ! but poorly constructed,This is a great system. Listening to my Cds I heard some instruments I never knew were there. This really picks up great sound. The reason I gave it four stars was because about after a month of owning it the Cd disc changer broke and I couldn't get my Cds out! Fortunately it was still under warrenty but I had to drive about an hours worth away to get it to be repaired. But aside from that it has fantastic sound. Panasonic just needs to pay more attention to the works now. I hope this review is helpful.
4,Nice set of rechargable led balls!,This is a very nice set of rechargable led balls. The only thing I would suggest is to add another switch so you can turn off the system without modifying the color you've chosen for your lights.
5,maybe a miracle,"Hooray Monroe!! I love this book and hope to see more from Strausse, who is obviously a gifted writer....Thank you Brian."
3,So So,"What starts as a near Oprah literary tragedy morphs into rumination and cautionary tale of religious belief and fanaticism taken to the hilt. Likable, middle child Monroe Anderson is trying to get by the best he can mostly by using his wicked sarcasm as a coping mechanism. After saving his sister from a pool accident that leaves her in a coma, his family is transformed by the power of faith, and the need to believe in something higher, especially when his sister becomes stigmata with the power to heal.I loved Monroe's voice and found him so winning throughout,yet felt the underlying messages about religion, not faith, (even though I agreed with them one hundred percent), started to feel a bit heavy handed. The last third of the novel also felt a bit sweet and cheesy with a finale that while maybe inevitable I found a bit hard to accept. Still, it's an enjoyable book, I just think I was expecting a bit more."
1,One of the worst books I ever read,"The book is written in very amateurshish style. Much like a high school student would write. The plot is terrible and pretty much non existent. I read and read thinking it would get better - it didn't. Dont waste your time. Reading the phone book or a dictionary would be better use of your time and more entertaining than reading this heap of non-literary, lack of imagination piece of work."
2,Don't understand all the great reviews!,"I couldn't wait to start this book, I had read so many good things about it....I really had a hard time getting through it. I liked the narrator, the character telling the story, but I had a hard time conncecting with the other characters. The book was slow, tedious, cliche. I hate writing bad reviews, most of the time I just don't write anything...but this was a big let down."
2,"Some of it dragged, but.... (minor spoiler)","there were many really good parts, especially toward the end of the book."
