2,It could be much better,"My card worked with XP by its support for it was scarce to say the least. Range is bad, and the prove is that Linksys has released a 2.5 version of this card with the new feature of 'extended range'. Look somewhere else."
3,Nice card.. if you have a small house,"Hi,I bought this card because all my other equipment was Linksys and I figured this card will work perfect with it!It did, and still does, there are just some areas in the house where I don't have reception with the card....Overall a nice card, but the reception is not very good. The USB one is much better with great reception all over the place.But of course that one has a wire on there and all so it's a trade off."
4,A decent wireless card,The setup was incredibly easy and it was operating in minutes. Signal strength has been great so far operating in public wireless hotspots.
2,"Won't work well with XP, good with 2000","This card hardly works at all with my Sony Vaio laptop running windows xp, but it does work well with my compaq evo running windows 2000. I don't know if it is the operating system, with all the bad reviews about this card not working well... I think I will have to suck it up and buy a Orinoco or a Netgear card for my Sony."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS INFERIOR PRODUCT,"I bought the Linksys WPC11 v3 card because I have a Linksys WAP Router. I tried to install it on my laptop, which runs Windows 2000, and, despite spending 3.5 hours on the phone with two different incompetent Linksys Techinical Support Associates, could never get it to work, even though the company claims its product is Windows 2000 compatible. Windows 2000 never even recognized the driver. The last thing their tech support person said to me was, ""I don't think it's going to work on your computer.""Then I bought a D-Link DWL-650+ at Office Depot for $... more, and, including solving a problem with the drivers being out of date, the very competent D-Link tech support and I got the card running within 1/2 hour."
1,BAD CUSTOMER SUPPORT,After 2 calls to India and three emails requesting a good driver. I give up. Their support is so bad that I was unable to convince them that the last two emails that they sent me did not have an attachment. I guess arguing with the customer is there new strategy.
4,"great product, very easy",this was incredibly easy to set up with my existing cable modem. just install the software and its done. check the price though...
1,Toshiba + XP + Linksys card = $%^#%^$,"I have a toshiba laptop with Xp and I am on my third card this week? Yes, when I got my toshiba, it was perfect, flawless. It remained so until I went with the linksys wireless setup (b series wireless cable router 2.4). The linksys card works good for the first ten minutes. In the next 10 - 50 minutes, the system will lockup, and I have to take my battery out to reboot. All three have broken within the first two hours of operation. The laptop gets really hot and the card is even hotter. I have adjusted all settings to minimums, but this card just loves to overheat. I know of two other people that have had similar problems and went with the d-link 2.4 ghz. ..."
2,"Poor Quality Product, Bad Technical Support,","This is the third linksys product that has failed on me. This card slowly had a harder and harder time keeping a good signal until finally it failed completely.While it was working, it's impossible to get better than 40-bit WEP security running on this with a Linksys WAP. They claim it's still a 'beta' feature (over a year after I purchased it).The overall knowledge level of their support people is very poor, so unless you are extremely savvy, you wouldn't even stand a chance with them.Try D-Link, their products seem much better."
3,Great device but impossible to install.,After a half a day of trying to get the card to work I found it to work beautifully. My suggestion for those who also buy the wireless router... do not follow the quick installation guide. All you must remember is mode=Infrastructure.
1,Poor performance under XP using D-Link WAP,"I used this card under Windows 2000 accessing a D-LINK WAP. Installation, setup, configuration, and speed were excellent. I was averaging about 70-90% link quality and around 6Mbps transfer between PC's. The DLInk was connected to a cable modem and speed was amazing. I just got an XP laptop and started using this card. Performance has dropped to aroun 20-40% link quality and MAYBE 1Mbps data transfer. It's almost like being back to dial-up. The drivers released for XP .... I've tried reinstalling, using the config utility, not using the config utility, you name it. I have a small condo and I'm about 50 feet from the WAP as the crow flies. I have a few walls between me and the WAP but that was no problem under Win2K. I'm VERY disappointed in this thing. ..."
3,poor customer tech service,The product seems like it's working (finally up with no help from their support people) fine but the customer support was poor. After waiting on hold for 1.5 hours the tech was less than helpful and actualy disconnected the call.
5,kickin',"great disc. 'dark end of the street' is dark, moody, classic whigs. 'My World Is Empty Without You/I Hear A Symphony' is great, too. really gives you a feel for what they sound like live. get this. now."
2,Busted is a bust,"This CD is a big disappointment after hearing BACHBUSTERS and BEETHOVEN OR BUST. It contains duplicates from these previous albums and a lot of other music that isn't especially pleasant to listen to and has no central theme. The Mozart additions are not very exciting and sound a lot like cuts from the previous albums. I had hoped to hear some great Mozart stuff on this disc, but it isn't there."
3,Safari De-Matting Comb for dogs,It works to pull a mat out but I have to cut the mat with a scissors first then comb thru with the de-matting comb. I think the comb will work better when my dog is totally de-matted and I keep on top of the problem? I don't think this is still the answer to the problem of de-matting.
2,my dog hates it,The comb is ok for small mats but date to try on bigger ones. The blades are not sharp enough and its pooling my dogs hair which is very painful for her. I'm in the search for something better.
2,Not great.,"I bought this to try to get mats off of an exceptionally sensitive dog. He howls if this thing comes near him now. This might be better for younger, less neurotic dogs, but has been sitting in a drawer here for a few months now."
3,Good but not great...,After reading all the glowing reviews for the Safari De-Matting Comb I decided to try it. Not Impressed. Overall I found it to do what it's supposed to. It works well with a gentle sawing motion and as long as you are patient. It took me 15 minutes to remove one matted clump from my Spaniel's underbelly. Personally I think I can get more done with a metal comb as the teeth are closer together and I don't have to make repeated passes in the same spot to catch the knots. I really can't complain too much being that the price was so great but I found the blades to be impossible to reverse. There really is no way to safely remove the blades without the risk of damaging the blades or my hands!! If anyone has had success in reversing the blades please let me know your technique!
2,grooming brush,"If you are LEFT handed, this thing is useless.The blades point in the wrong direction and its awkward to hold, if you are LEFT handed.Other than that, the handle feels good and comfortable in the hand and thick enoughto make it easy to hold on to."
5,Great grooming tool.,The tool is small enough that it doesn't pull too big of an area to hurt our dog. It is good at cleaning the undercoat. Glad I purchased it to groom our terrier.
5,Works like a charm!!,"I love this comb. I have a Labradoodle, and since the weather is colder we've let his coat grow a little longer. He had a few mats on his chest, his ears and around his neck and this comb took care of them! One side of the tines is sharp (I didn't realize this at first, and cut my thumb!) so it cuts through the tangled hair while combing the not-tangled hair. So you don't have to cut mat out, just run this comb through it a couple of times and only the tangles get cut out. It takes a little while to get used to, but it's great to be able to take care of his mats without taking him to the groomer! I suspect this would not work on significant matting - but for some matting here and there it's perfect."
4,Great for long-haired cats,"My parents' ragdoll is a beautiful cat, but she has a very light coat and it's hard for her shedding to drop, so she gets matted really easily along her chest and near her legs. This is a little large for her, but it's not hard to adjust and get a few blades behind her mats to saw through. The big handle is very comfortable and makes control easy."
4,Works well,Product is excellent! Removes mats very well but I have a hard time using it because I'm left handed. It says it's reversible. I just can't quite figure it out. I don't know how to reverse it. Help?
3,Not too impressed,"This manages to dice up the loose hair on my husky's legs. However, it seems to be pulling out a lot of hair, so i do not use it anymore. I just stick to routine brushing to keep matting away."
5,removes matted hair with ease,i would recomend for dog tangled hair clears fast my dog loves gromming yours will too saves monthly cost of trimmng by pro salon !
5,Works great,We have 2 American Eskimo Dogs that have long white coats. The comb makes brushing so much easier that conventional combs or brushes. And it is a lot more pleasant for the dogs.
5,Slices through Matted Fur!,"If you have a dog like mine (Akita-Chow mix) that has a heavy coat of fur and a thick undercoat, you'll need three products: a coarse comb, a fine comb, and a dematting comb. The Safari Pet Products DSFW6116G Dematting Comb is a great tool for cutting through thick, twisted, tangled sections of fur. Much better than using a pair of scissors. My dog doesn't like the pulling action of the comb as it saws through the matted fur, so I limit the amount of time that I spend doing this to no more than 5 minutes at a time. I follow that up by using the more gentle action fine comb and coarse comb that he enjoys.As far as a fine comb and a course comb are concerned, I'd recommend the following two products: ""FURminator deShedding Tool"" and ""Oster Pro Pet Grooming Undercoat Rake"". The deShedding Tool does a good job of pulling up and clipping the undercoat, while the Undercoat Rake gently rakes and smooths out the coat."
5,PERFECT!! EXACTLY WHAT MY DOG NEEDED!!,"I rarely write reviews on products, but this one was so over the top wonderful, I just had too. My dog was in doggie boot camp for 3 weeks and in a kennel. When he returned, his ears had over an inch of matted fur and his belly and tail were horrible. This happened once before when my kids decided to give him a bath outside without drying him or brushing him. That time the groomer had to shave him as low as she could go, especially his ears!! With this comb, I was able to comb through all the mats within about 15 minutes, and my usually hyperactive dog just laid there, no complaints, no flinching, nothing. When I was done, I combed out ALL THE MATTED HAIR and took him to the groomer. When he returned he was as awesome looking as ever, with no mats. I was going to buy one of these for my groomer for Christmas, but she already had one, and loves it. I would highly reccommend this to anyone with mat issues or just combing through long thick hair."
5,great product,My dogs were so matted! This sliced right through the knots. They would hide as soon as I touched any comb. I'm hoping this changes their attitude toward grooming.
2,cut combe,this item is not suitable for the hair behind ears seems only to cut into coat not glide into it
5,I love this perfume,I love the smell and ask for this every year for Christmas. definitely worth the money for the size bottle. I even like the cute grange looking bottle
3,enhance's quality,I wish that you work the more and more to improve it quality because I find the quality isn't anough strong.
1,Britney spears- Curious,"I used to love Curious. I asked for it for my birthday and my boyfriend bought me the large bottle with the atomizer and the lotion. However, a few months after I got it, it started to smell funny... over time the atomizer became very hard and had a sticky film all over it. When I opened the bottle I gaged at the stench. I poured it down the sink and it was yellow. I do not recommend buying this product and if you must have this scent please don't buy it with the atomizer. The lotion still smells good."
5,Excellent condition,Really fast shipping and the item is excellent- I've always use this perfume ever since back in high school and nowadays- they are so hard to find in stores so I found these items through amazon- I'm really happy about it and really good price. Thanks! :-D
1,"Sorry, not for me....","This has a very....""fleshy"" smell that I don't particularly like. Waaaaaaaay too heavy on the musk for me. I'd describe it as a sweaty, or oily smell. I think I'd recommend it as a summer scent though."
1,Stink to high....,"This has got to be the single most nasty perfume on the market. Worse than Red Door. Worse than Shalimar. Worse than White Shoulders. Worse than Designer Imposters.This perfume smells like it's bottle aroma from grandmas 50 year old wedding bouquet rotton and dry in the attic. I don't get many florals out of this, or fruit, or anything that is even remotely sexy. I belive that to cover yourself in mothballs would be a better way to get people to ask you what you're wearing. At least that smell is unmistakable. With this fragrance, people will think you just stink."
5,BEST!,I love this perfume one of my all time faves! smells amazing my husband loves it. and of course bottle is adorable. i dont think Britney has ever made a bad perfume though.
5,One of my all-time favorites!,"As other reviewers have said, this one keeps getting lent out and subsequently, purchased over and over. I came today for my 4th or 5th copy... I can't remember. Although fiction, I caught myself saying over and over ""Yeah, that could've happened""!"
2,Not our favorite,This book was recommended by a friend. My husband and I read together and neither of us found it especially enjoyable. It was difficult to finish and the story moved along at a snails pace. We found it overly wordy and the detailed accounts of the settings a bit excessive. Not for us and we would not recommend it.
5,exactly what I wanted,I have long been a fan of OG Mandino and wanted a hard cover copy of this book. THe book came quickly and was exactly what I wanted. Thank you
5,Uplifting,"This is a MUST read, this book will have you feeling angry,sad,happy,shocked etc...I will read this book again. It is based on Bible facts and also helps the reader to understand more about the Bible and Jesus. Definitely worth the money!! You will catch yourself not wanting to put it down and when you do you cant wait to be able to pick it back up. I have and will continue to recommend this book to people."
5,Great Sensor and no issues so far,"Quick review:We just had an alarm system upgrade and the whole system was replaced. I told the installer and company installing the alarm I didn't want any false alarms via motion sensor!! Well 3 false alerts later all via the motion sensor I looked into a replacement motion sensor myself and I found this model with dual detect.My installer came out swap out his garbage with the Optex MX40PI and now we just had to wait and see if this motion sensor would trigger any false alarms..... 3 months later no issues, no false alarms and works like a champ. We have cats and 2 of them are larger size and like to run around like crazy in the house and no issues, so we are very happy with this unit !!So if your having the same issue I was with the cheap motion sensors installed, replace them with these Optex MX40PI and you will be happy campers. No more false alarms :)"
4,Countdown to Christmas by Bill Peet,"This is a cute take-off on the classic ""'Twas the Night Before Christmas."" The story starts off on ""the fourtheenth of December, way back in the sixties, 'twas the jet age remember?"" Santa wants to update things a bit. He ditches his traditional, ratty old sack by throwing out the window into the wind and goes with a mod pschodelic version. He tries spray painting his sled in tie-dye fashion. Unfortunately, when he tries to pack the new bag, he can't fit the toys!! Now he is on a frantic search of the North Pole to find his bag. Will he find it? Will the children of the world ever find toys under the tree? Read the book to see."
2,Quality Issue,The product showed up open missing 7 fun dip packets. I would not recommend purchasing this product. Very disappointing since I needed the total amount for two classrooms. : (
2,Far too defused and general,"This book assumes too low a level knowledge. As a result a lot of time is spent laying ground work. Everything from OOA/OOD to database technology is covered. For a beginner, this may be appropriate; however, if you are looking for a focused discussion of application servers, look elsewhere."
3,rough,came in a rather rough conditon... glad i got it though because i lent my original away... great bookdid come on time
4,Kut Klose.......Ladies I'll Make You Surrender,"Tabitha, Athena, and Lavonn, I'll leave all of my women for you three. Let's talk music, Surrender, I Like, Keep On, Giving You My Love Again, and the songs with Keith Sweat sound great. These ladies were in the range of groups like SWV and Jade. That's a good class to be in."
4,Go get it!,"This CD not only takes you back to the real days of R&B, but I know most eighties babies can relate to each song. I play it all the way through! Good buy!"
3,I Like,"This CD would be worth the effort for the song ""I Like"" alone. Yes, these girls were puppets of Keith Sweat, but their vocal talent shines through on this song especially. It's repetitive and singsongy, but the combination of Keith's sexy lyrics, instrumentation and these girls great singing makes a perfect pop single that belongs in every Ipod. The lead singer has a very distinctive voice."
4,great for love making,"ok,its bad for us girls to make sexual slow jams geared to guys.but its ok for us to make male bashing songs for girls?,what kinda femenistic hipocritical bull$hit is that?...............aren't both types of R&B; exploiting the target demographic?(thats not to say that was kut klose's intentions)either way this is a great love making album,even if it was geared towards guys.i like,get up on it,lay my body down are all great headboard bangers.its obviousdly not aimed at girls but so what.i like it so thats all i care about really,i think it was probably the most overlooked R&B; albums of the 90's,just due to the simple fact it was targeting guys.besides isn't that what destiney's child was doing in the begining when they was targeting girls with their ghetto azz male bashing chicken head songs like bills bills bills?............sheesh when will the hipocracy and double standards end?"
3,"Buy this CD just for the single ""I Like""","I'm listening to it now at work and it feels just like it did my senior year of high school when this album dropped. Incidentally, Tabitha Duncan went to my high school ... but a few years before me (I'm not that old).At any rate, I actually kinda miss that 1990s R&B; sound ... smooth, cool, slow, laid back slow jams. ""I Like"" will take you back or catch you up if you a new jack not up on what's a dying breed of old school R&B; soul.Classic, classic track, indistinctive album by a group that jumped on the bandwagon after En Vogue and TLC blew up."
2,Don't Surrender To Lukewarm R&B,"This CD has three decent songs on it and that's pretty much all it has. Kut Klose didn't have a distinctive sound, so I knew that there wouldn't be a follow-up album. Most of the songs on ""Surrender"" are too slow and there's too much emphasis on sex. ""I Like"" was the jam back in the day, but I'm sure that a lot of people have forgetten about the song as well as Kut Klose."
2,Nothing Here Worth Getting Excited About,"Kut Klose is one of those her today gone tomorrow artists. Yes they had a hit single ""I Like"" but the bad thing about it is that the song itself is very typical cookie cutter music and doesnt hold up as being remembered. I think Keith Sweat produced their album and most of the material here sound like his leftovers he gave to them. This group is nothing special vocally or lyrically. They have absolutely nothing to fall back on besides Keith Sweat who produced a bunch of average songs for them talking about the samething. There were so many 1 hit wonders around this time. All these record labels kept pushing out all these average singers that didnt standout from anyone else. Kut Klose vanished faster then they came and nobody cares."
3,"""Creation: 0, Evolution: 1""","Obviously, I do not agree with the reader's comments below. If one wants to enjoy a book that analyzes the question of religious versus scientific creation, I recommend ""The Bible According to Einstein,"" where there are some interesting suggestions of the presence of a supreme being but where the natural processes that play such an important role in the physical world are also emphasized."
1,"For real science, read V. S. Ramachandran instead.","As a book on modern scientific knowledge, this book falls sadly short of the mark. The material just doesn't hold together.For a much better discussion of the roots of intelligence, the self, and the design of our minds, read V. S. Ramachandran's excellent book ""Phantoms in the Brain""."
1,Compares poorly with the quality of Ernst Mayr's books.,"Before you read this book, please read Ernst Mayr's excellent book ""One Long Argument: Charles Darwin and the Genesis of Modern Evolutionary Thought"". Then read this one, and compare the clarity of the writing, the quality of the evidence presented, and the plausibility (and testability) of the explanations advanced.I did this. Result: Evolutionary Thought 1; Creationist Thought 0. No contest."
3,"Potentially, very good. Potentially. However ..........","Parts of this recording are very good. I like a lot of things about this recording. The cast includes some fine singers. Rosemary Joshua, Gerald Finlay, Maria Christina Kiehr and Robin Blaze, to name a few. The orchestra performs well and the choir is good.However, some of the singers let this recording down. I am mainly talking about Dominique Visse, who I normally admire very much. Dominique Visse turns parts of this recording into a freak show. Why this was allowed to happen is a mystery to me. The duets with the other countertenor sound ridiculous, it is as if monsieur Visse was throwing a tantrum.There are a number of better recordings of the great opera on the market - Christie, Pinnock, Hogwood, Gardiner and Mackerras have all made some very good recordings of this work."
3,Above low expectations,"Opera is one of the toughest genres for me to penetrate, although the 17th century British composer's one and only baroque-styled offering is slightly more manageable at times; best in instrumental segues or choral accompaniment, and not without squirm-inducing solos."
3,Only A Start,"Weighing in at under 70 pages including appendices, this is a thin book, which would be easier to accept if not for the price tag.Although it's a good general introduction to the topic, it's lacking in details and organization. Too much time is spent on things that most readers probably already know (like a list of manufacturers of professional-quality audio equipment). Just as the information starts to get good, the reader is given a list of other books to check out instead, or is advised to hire a professional-- something that goes against the do-it-yourself theme suggested by the title.In short, if you're trying to decide whether or not to start your own recording label, this book should explain enough to guide your decision. If you've already decided to go this route, pick up a more substantial book instead."
4,Remarkably durable,"This toy is remarkably durable. My parents gave it to him because I would have never purchased it, expecting it to break within minutes. My kid has been driving it through the house, sat on it, pull the lever everyway he could get it to go and it all still works! The bed raises and lowers according to the pull of the lever.The down side is that the music is loud (especially if you don't care for the musical selections of the manufacturer) and it makes grinding noises as it's pushed (although my son likes the noise)."
2,Toy Ocariina,"The product is really just a toy, but it's priced appropriately so I have no complaints. Someone looking for a real musical instrument should expect to pay much more, and look for a wooden or ceramic version."
1,TOY--don't expect much,"If you're looking for a windy sound (as opposed to crisp) with subtle pitch changes (instead of full) then this would be okay for you. It's cheap. It won't shatter if you drop it.Common sense says it's not going to sound good (at all), and it doesn't, but you CAN slightly make some tunes.A child's gift would be good if you have the rationale of, ""I don't want to get little Johnny/Suzy something really expensive if s/he's only going to use it once... I'll go with a cheap one and see if s/he wants to stick with it before I upgrade to better quality."""
5,challenge for troops,This item was bought to send overseas to give our troops a challenge on their down time and mentally recharge themselves. This is definitely something they would not buy for themselves making it more special for them.
5,Awesome band from NJ,"Alright, let me just start off by saying that this is a great band and because they're so young, they'll only get better. You know they're well accomplished musicians when they've put out 2 full length CD's and they're only around 20 years old. It's hard to sum up Saves the Day's sound because it's pretty original. They play kind of a fast hard backround but their singers voice is very melodic. It sounds really good. In comparison to their sophmore release, I'd have to say that this one is slightly better. My favorite songs on this CD are ""Deciding"", ""Blindfolded"", and ""the Choke""...but they're all pretty solid. If you get a chance to see these guys live, go for it. I saw them and they were awesome."
4,Can't Slow Down,This is Saves the Day's first album and is most likly their best. It showcases the band at an early age full of youthful energy. It has hints of punk and emo but also a hardcore feel with it's speed and breakdowns that you can not want to just dance to. An amazing record and it is sad to see the band has made such a huge departure from this work. Not to say that Through Being Cool and Stay What You Are are bad but they just do not posses the same hardcore youthful energy of Can't SlowDown with it's song for every occasion that will be stuck in your head everyday.
2,Disappointing,"I tried to like this album... I really did. I enjoy emo music, but this just didn't do it for me. The Choke and Three Miles Down are both very good tracks, but beyond that, there's not much here. All of the rest of the songs sound about the same, and there's nothing that stands out about them. There are much better selections within this style of music. I would suggest The Get Up Kids' ""Something to Write Home About"". That is a much better investment that ""Can't Slow Down""."
1,Bad....real bad...,"Can't slow down was a huge disapointment for me...I really liked ""Through with being cool"" although it took a few listens for me to get used to it and I think ""Stay what you are"" is one of the best CD's I own. So I had high expectations for ""Can't slow down."" It's just not catchy, I really tried to like it, but it was a waste of money..."
3,"doesnt save the day, but definitely puts a smile on the face","these guys are definitely a good band worthy of being compared to lifetime (yes, they do sound like them with more melodic vocals). blindfolded is an amazing song. saw them live a couple weeks ago on tour for the new album. very tight and definitely rocking. keep it cool yall. later."
2,.......,"I heard their ""At your funeral"" single and I was impressed. I figured I would check out their older stuff. Stay away from this record. It's a rehashed, boring, 3-chord, NOFX, Blink182, YAWNFEST. This is like Blink182 but with no catchy hooks (i.e. NOFX). If you like boring 3-chord songs where the singer sings the exactly melody of the guitar then this record is for you."
1,Crap,"If you're like me and you were stupid enough to buy this cd after hearing stay what you are you will be sadly mistaken. These two cds are completely opposite cd's. All of the songs on cant slow down sound the same and the songs are short, but not sweet. I hate this cd dont buy it."
5,Inspiration to Others,"In ""Sins and Needles"" Ray and Melanie Materson share a message of hope, that people can and do change. The prison experience is often so damaging that it serves to derail those who truly are committed to improving their lives. Ray's story is unique in its journey, but not in its message. As a reader I found genuine insight to the cost of addiction, both to its victims and to society at large. I've already shared my copy with friends and will continue to do so. Keep up the good work, Ray!"
1,"This one should be filed under ""fiction"" instead of bios","This book is written by a ""former"" criminal, substance abuser, wife-beater, and dead-beat Dad, who claims that somehow through prison and his art, he supposedly reached some type of ""spiritual healing"", and is now a wonderful person. If you're looking for a bad guy redemption fairy tale, and aren't particular about whether it's well-written OR the fact that there is obviously so much more to the story that is not being told, you may enjoy this book. Otherwise, don't bother. This book is booooring, and totally unbelievable."
1,Little Things,"""Sins and Needles"" is a little book with a little story embellished with little pictures of Ray Materson's stichery. Although it's not big news that someone turns their life around and does a good thing, it's good to know it still happens. Perhaps it should have been called a journal of a man's prison experience because it is more like a journal when reading it. Surprising are the positive reviews because it's not all that amazing, not the writing, the art or the story. Yawn."
1,Try Fiction,My good sense tells me that writing this book made the Matersons feel better about themselves. My mind tells me to thank God I never went the way of abuse or criminal activity. My experience tells me we all have a life story to tell. Reading this book showed me most of us do not tell our story to make money or a movie. If the Matersons want money and fame here's some advice: try fiction or learn how to write without being so self-serving.
1,Recovery Revisited,"Ray Materson and Melanie Materson have penned yet another ""recovery"" book not unlike those on bookshelves for the past 2 decades. It's difficult to find the inspiration in the art or narrative provided by the couple. Although it must be time consuming to craft so many stiches into a small space, it can also be said Mozart crammed many notes into a measure. While Mozart's music can be appreciated on many levels by many people, the artistic quality of Materson's work does not appear to have widespread interest among anyone who cannot relate to being an addict. The good news is Materson has returned to society. One would hope other ex-convicts have also put aside the past and become good citizens. God forbid if they all tell their stories! Save the trees please!"
1,Overpriced,"The book and the art pictured in the book are overpriced. It's a good thing the Matersons can sell this art because their first attempt at book writing is disappointing. The moral of this story is that while it's good to save oneself from being a criminal others are just not that interested. I suppose the poor sales of the book are due to the fact that either a bad reputation will come back to haunt you or your karma will. Now, that's a high price to pay."
1,Do not by for AlvaradoJunior; they are selling OLD CRAP!!!!!!!!,"As the title says, ""Do not by from AlvaradoJunior; they are selling OLD CRAP"" Please allow me to explain. The item in question is a FORD IMMOBILIZER BYPASS. This was to upgraid my cars alarm system. When I opened the box there was not just dust on it but a GRIMY substance on the outside of the package; that stuck to my finger. This installer looked at it and said, ""This is old stock but it should work.""It was not just old stock but very old stock it dated back to the year 2002 and did not work. This was only $17 but a new/working unit cost $60.00. When I contacted the seller, ""AlvaradoJunior."" They send me a nice form e-mail telling me how they stood behind there products but I never heard from AlvaradoJunior again.I will never buy from AlvaradoJunior again and you should not buy from AlvaradoJunior ether."
1,Not a good choice.,"I do not recommend this product.The manual is almost impossible to follow and incomplete. If you do not have access to detailed wiring information for your vehicle or a great deal of experience working with security systems, you will not be successful installing this.After installation, the unit came on only one time and never again, so programming the PATs system to accept it was not possible. I am not returning it, as I should have done my homework before buying it - but it is being replaced by a more up to date and functional bypass module."
3,It's Not lounge,"If you surfed your way to this page, chances are you like Downtempo, Lounge, Chill style. This CD plays in a different register. The tempo is more on the outskirt of Dance music. Jose Padilla's vocal choice on songs # 9, 13 and some others is anything but original. It even emphasize the Dance tempo. I wish if it was more subtle ..."
4,"smooth, ambient, trippy, jazzy, ahhh...&#65533;","This is a wonderfull compilation of downbeat ambient sounds ... this album is the first true ambient album I came to love. By far the best album of the whole series.Downbeat, upbeat, chilly and smooth a real recommendation. The perfect music to chill and lounge on a hot summer day, or just to relax on a tired sunday noon!"
3,"It May Be Volume 5, But it's Not Worth 5 Stars","Ambient Compilations are far too common nowadays. Very easy to collect an album's worth of tracks at any given time thanks to the thriving Ibiza music scene (where Cafe del Mar lives). So what makes a great album different from an OK album. Generally just track selection, but a great album is usually mixed which none of the Cafe del Mar compilations are. Regardless they do put out some decent ambient/chillout albums, and after collecting a few, one can make their own favorite chillout mix.This is the fifth installment of the still going strong series. Not bad, but not great. I can't consider any of the tracks as phenomenal, but I do think there are a couple of duds. ""Tout Est Bleu"" [Original Ame Strong S.A. Remix] and ""Talking With Myself"" '98 [Canny Remix] receive the dud awards for this album.3/5 stars."
3,"It's good, but it could be better.",The best of these series is Volume 5 and Volume 3. This one is OK but it could be better.
3,the series did get abit tired...,"One of my favourite tracks ever from the series is the last track on Volumen Ocho, Plum Crazy by Celestial. And if you like that sound, then you'll love the albums from Hong Kong's Celestial. Check them out, they are titled:Hong Kong Dub StationHappy ValleySpirit Houseit's a deeper dubbier sound that most of Cafe Del Mar, more real instruments, and more space..."
3,Disappointed,"There are a few tracks that I really enjoyed, but on the whole I was disappointed with the CD."
3,"Good, but too Rhumba-delic","This volume stands out a bit from the ones I already have as a deviation from the electronica/ambient/cool tone of the others. Although volume 5 is solid and enjoyable it is NOT a typical Cafe Del Mar CD. The music is more lively and danceable with plenty of rhumba-delic beats. This is not a bad thing, but is not what I expected either.Do NOT buy this volume if you want more of what is on 6 & 7: cool, calm, electronica/ambient music.DO buy this volume if you'd like some light, well-crafted breezy music best for brunch backgrounds or dancing in the living room on a Sunday afternoon with your honey."
5,soft chilling,"Great music to unwind to on a weekend day. I own most of the Del Mar series and Volumes 3,4 and 5 are where its at. Takes me back to the poolside bars in the Greek Islands where I was first introduced to this series."
5,One of my absolute favourites,"Whereas the entire series of Café del Mar CDs is very good, volume 5 is by far the best of all. Its soft tunes will transform anywhere you listen to it in a perfect chill out (even if you're hearing it on your diskman in the bus to work). Some of the songs are amazing (like Negresses Vertes' ""Face a la mer""). If you can't manage to make it to a health spa, buy this record!"
5,great toy.,my grandson loves these after putting the little puzzles together he loves to line them up and play with them like stepping stones! really enjoys them.
3,did not keep my toddler occupied,"I am a huge fan of Lauri toys and when my younger child (2) reached for my older kid's (3.5) puzzles (Lauri as well) I though it was a good time to invest in puzzles for him. While he remains interested in his sister's puzzles, he was bored with these in 5 minutes. We sat down and I tried all sorts of ways to keep him entertained, but he just didn't care much. I still think it's a great toy, it just didn't work for us."
4,The Nature Of America: A Musical Impression,"This is a very good sampler of contemporary American composers, weighted more towards those writing for the movie industry. The music is very relaxing, and is quite enjoyable to sit back and listen to. The tracks are generally quite recognizable. We purchased this initially as a gift for some French friends. But we enjoyed it so much, we ended up buying a copy for ourselves."
5,"Yes, It Does Help.",I have Plantar Fascitis and have been using this on the days that I do not go to therapy. It definelty helped to speed up my healing process. My therapist suggested I continue to use this after I complete my therapy sessions. Make sure you have something to hold onto when you use it. I highly recommend it. It does work.
4,unilateral step stretch,We ordered this item for my husband who has a lot of pain from arthritis. His doctor recommended this item and it has been a tremendous help with relieving pain associated with plantar fasciitis and his back pain too! Highly recommend this item and the price is right!!
5,Good PT,"I broke my ankle in 3 places in Dec. and have much hardware. This was used at PT and I felt it was so helpful, that I bought one for at home. It starts my day, every day to get that flexibility going."
2,COMPLETELY UNECESSARY,"I bought this thinking it was going to be some magical contraption that stretched my calves in places I could not, using conventional stretches -- WRONG!This is nothing but an unnecessary unit. I can stretch just as well against a wall or using a conventional calf stretch. If anything, I feel that, with this, there is an increased risk of OVERSTRETCHING the ligaments in the ankle.I gave it two stars because it did stretch. I deducted three stars because it is overly expensive for what it is. It gives you a uni-lateral stretch -- just another fancy way of saying stretches your calf in ONE direction."
5,"excellent stretch for achilles, calve muscles","The extra dorsiflexion achieved with this device gives a tremendous stretch to the posterior muscles and tendons of the the lower leg. Patients suffering from chronic tightness of the calves, achilles tendon and plantar fascitis will notice considerable improvement very quickly after using the ProStretch. Several of my patients have purchased this after trying it in the office."
2,Review of the Pro Strech,"Although this item was recommended to me by my physical therapist, I did'nt find it very practical for execise. However, the product I received is as described and arrived in time."
1,The worst,This is a terrible product. I am surprised that amazon even allows it on their site.It does nothing has noflexibility what so ever and once you let them know that. They just automatically send you another one andcharge your account without ever even giving you any notice at all. Bad buissness for a bad product. I am sovery disappointed in Amazon for even selling this item.
5,Awesome. Curing my pain. Never woulda believed it.,"This little doohickey is fantastic. I'm in my 30s and have fabulous shoes I haven't been wearing the past few months because of increasing pain in my left heel. The first few times I used this the pain actually was worse for the day, one time so much I wanted to hop around on one foot, but now it's been a week and I have SIGNIFICANT improvement in my pain. I'm even eyeing my red heels again. A few more weeks and I should be ready to wear them!"
4,Prostretch System,I have had many problems with my legs over the last two years from one thing or another medically. Now all the tests have showed that there is no problem with my legs as far as blockages and blood flow was concerned but still I experienced major calf pain when I tried to walk. My son recommended this system of stretching out the calf muscle and within five days of using it I am able to walk a mile in the morning without stopping to get rid of the pain in my legs. I checked around to see where to buy this system and Amazon had the very best price as well as the added benefit of armchair shopping. I am very satisfied with this product.
5,ProStretch,"I was having crazy pains in my foot and calves would cramp like crazy after running. Went to see the doc and said I had plantar flaci---something. So I stretched often and longer but it still hurt. Physical therapist suggested this device, it def gives me a much deeper stretch and it's convenient. No more calf cramps and it is def less painful on my feet running."
3,Tried for Plantar Fasciitis,"I bought this about 18 months ago and have used it for all 18 months but still have plantar fasciitis. I've had a shot, taken steroids, bought MBT shoes and purchased/wear prescription orthotics and still suffer. My case of PF is clearly difficult to get rid of so maybe this works better for the ""average"" case of PF."
3,A bit of a stretch,i used something like this when I was going through physical therapy for my broken ankle but for some reason this one doesn't feel as comfortable. You do get a good stretch but not sure it's really much better than you can get without or with a simple wedge. It's built well and does what it says I just don't know if it's worth the money. I couldn't recommend it to any one.
3,Very good product,I have used this and found it is helping me stretch my feet as well as my calf muscles. I cannot prove this but I think it'll ultimately help my hamstring.
3,Waste,I purchased because I had plantars faciatis. I would do anything to not be in pain. I tried this but went back to regular stretches. Used it just a few times. It does stretch but you need to use it while wearing sneakers.
5,Great exercise for anyone,I use this faithfully to stretch out calf muscles and it does the job. Easy to use anywhere you are in the house.
4,Great for my shin splints,I really like this product. I tend to get shin splints when I start to up my running mileage and I find that stretching out my calves helps the problem and provides quicker recovery. I'm glad I bought this.
4,My patient's love it,I haven't actually ordered this for myself but have ordered quite a few for my patients. They love it for easy stretching of their calves. And its small so doesn't take up much space. I would recommend it if you want to be able to stretch your calves daily with ease.
2,too small,I think this could be an effective product for me however I have size 12 feet and I think they're too big ffor for me to use the product effectively. amazon should state something about the product sizing. however it is quite effective for my girlfriend who has a much smaller foot ofcourse.
3,"Good and easy to use, but good ok for fascitis plantar.","This product is very easy to use, and its very good to stretch your aquiles tendon, but it doesn't improve the pain in my heels. it didnt help the fascitis plantar."
3,Not optimal for plantar fascitis,"This product serves well to help stretch various calf muscles, and is relatively easy to learn to use for that purpose, and seems to be well made and durable. But I was looking for a device that would help address plantar fascitis, and it is only marginally useful for that purpose."
1,Not worth the money!,"I had plantar faciitis. I bought this contraption and not only did it not help, I think it made the tear in my tendon worse! I went to a specialist and he showed me how to use a towel first thing in the morning to stretch the calf and tendon in my foot. That plus a good pair of New Balance shoes and a soft insert that lifted the heel just a bit healed my plantar faciitis. Don't waste you money!"
1,Be Careful!!,"I used this product and wound up with tarsal tunnel syndrome.....in other words, It damaged my ankle. Now I have foot and ankle pain."
1,"Size 13 shoe, keep looking",I suppose this product works well for someone with small feet. I wear a size 13 shoe. It's simply too small for my foot as my toes hang off of it thus preventing a full stretch. Worthless in my opinion.
2,Not worth the money,"I purchased this because I have plantar fasciitis. It was over sized for my foot. I didn't feel like it stretched my arch or there was any benefit. There was more stretch in my calf, than my foot. I was very disappointed!Save you money..."
2,Not all that,My general opinion is you can use a step and get a very similar stretch. Recommend saving your money on this one.
1,worthless,I know this thing is supposed to work and Ive even seen it in training rooms and gyms which makes me think that it has some use. My problem is this thing rocks forward so I cant stretch my calf because when it starts to stretch it just starts to rock forward till the stretch is gone! Personally I get a better stretch on the edge of a step or an angled board. Like I said this thing must work for someone but I get nothing from it.
3,It's OK but very over priced.,It's OK; but very over priced. Maybe worth $4. It's only function is to stretch the calf muscle. It leads you to believe it stretches the arch of the foot; but it does not (maybe a little).
5,Great Product,"arrived alot faster than it was expected , and works just like the one at the physical therapist office ."
5,GREAT MOVIE,GREAT MOVIE I LOVED IT. IT WAS GREAT. NEVER SAW ANYTHING BETTER. A MUST SEE. GREAT ACTORS IN THIS. COOL
2,Film,My husband wanted to collect a copy of the film. The story and the acting are poor. The film quality is good.
2,Not Really Biodegradeable,I researched these before buying because I wanted to make sure that I was buying a truly biodegradeable product. Well it turns out this is made from ple which cannot biodegrade in a typical compost pile such as in your backyard. If you throw it out and it ends up in a landfill they say it'll be 100 years or so before it biodegrades. That's not very environmentally friendly to me. I read about it at the Smithsonian magazine website. I'm posting a link that I hope works: smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/plastic.html?c=y&page=1
3,Just okay,"I purchased these thinking they would be like the World Centric ones that I got at Whole Foods. No such luck.The pros (beyond the obvious of biodegradability, etc.):*sturdy*hold up to heat wellThe cons:*very thick feeling*starchy smell when the package is first opened*the end third or so of the fork (opposite the tines) is very flexible and this quickly becomes annoying if you're trying to eat anything thick or hard to stab."
5,Delkin Card Reader 'eFilm',"I have used a Delkin Card Reader for two or three years and am very pleased with it. It's simple to use, eliminates the power supply required to power the camera when transferring images to computer, easy to send email from (when using MAPI). This second unit was purchased as a gift for a family member. Great accessory for such a low price. ChuckDelkin Devices DDREADER-38 18-in-1 USB 2.0 Card Reader"
2,Delkin DREADER-38,I purchased this item new for about half of what Amazon is selling it for. I thought I was getting a great deal. I found that inserting and removing my brand new SDHC card was very difficult. I checked the contacts of my card and found deep scratches. My conclusion is that the pins are either too stiff or too long. I have no idea why no other reviewer encountered this problem. I did not try any other memory cards with this reader so I can't comment on how it would work with other cards. I was however very disappointed and returned the product for a refund.
4,flash/SD review,"it works great. nothing hard about it at all, just plug in and use. The only small, small down side is that the small mall blue led is not very visable. but it gets the job done."
3,It's not Belkin but DELkin will do.,My original card reader went to my wife when hers fell apart (she crushed it by accident but will not admit it). She still uses a smart media card but her laptop and our new printer will not read those ancient cards. My old computer has no such card slots built in so I HAD to get another card reader.This Delkin reader functions well but it's tough to get an SD card in the slot provided. It handles the other formats with ease. My only knock on it is it does not have a cover. My old Belkin multi reader had a flip cover over the slots to keep dust out.
5,insightful,"I read this book as part of a class. It was one of the best, most insightful, and life changing books I've ever read. It is best taken in small sections and then reflected upon, ultimately reading over several weeks."
4,Great Case--Strong,"Very solid contruction--strong case materials, runners on the bottom of the case is a good design, excellent zippers-may sound silly, but zippers get a lot a wear and must be strong or the case is useless. Dividers work well and actually stay put on the velcro. Wheels are good. My only gripe is the handle--kind of flimsy. I had one of these come out of the case and had to be repaired. That being said--Tamrac service and support is excellent and repair work has been done promptly--Products actually made in the USA!"
4,Insightful analysis of Pre-Con Canada's economic growth,"A pared down and supposedly simplified version of the author's Ph.D. thesis, this book discusses the economic development of Pre-confederation Ontario and Quebec. Taking into account geographic, geopolitical and sociological aspects of the two provinces, the author shows how it was that Ontario gradually emerged to be the more vibrant and important economic center. But trust me, this is not exactly easy reading; this is the type of book that must be studied to be appreciated. Anyone seeking to do so will be greatly rewarded."
2,"ITS A GOOD CD BUT..........................Ws?T Up, No Love","Sorry dog, but I'M TRU too my set and my sid'.ANY CD WITH NOREAGA ON IT AUTOMATICALLY GETS NO RESPECT.......I'M A FAN THAT REMEMBERS L.A. L.A. BIG CITY AND DREAMS."
5,hi,Spice seems to be getting more melodic with time. This one and The Last Dance probably have the best melodies of his. I still like 1990-sick the best though cause its sooo nasty! He really needs to come up with some new lyrics. He tends to repeat the same words and phrases A little too much on each album.
5,cd purchase,I recently purchased a used cd and I love it. There are no defects with it and I received it from the seller in a timely manner. I would do business with this seller again.
2,Defect,"I bought the Samsung SyncMaster 152B thinking I will have a flawless LCD monitor. I just spent a lot of money for graphics hardware for my computer. To my disappointment, this Samsung monitor has a pixel defect which Samsung would not cover under the warranty. Buyers of LCD monitors should be made aware of this unfair condition that there must be a certain number of dead pixels in your monitor even right out of the box for the companies to replace them.I rate this monitor two stars. The monitor is too bright for me."
4,Mental Keys to Hitting.,Good well written book. All baseball hitters should read and always begin with the basics. The mental toughness this book projects to players is well worth the read.
4,good version,This is a good version of this often recorded work. Unlike the other reviewer I thought the sound was good. I didn't think the tutti had any hard over-brassy edge as they imply and I wasn't able to detect any excessive degree of stereo -- not sure how I would detect it. Overall this version holds its own with others I have heard.The Academic Festival Overture is not my favorite piece so I'll admit right now that I haven't bothered to listen to it all the way through here. Of course anyone buying this is doing so to listen to the symphony anyway.This is good not great. The price is a plus.
3,LINDA'S HOMECOMING,"I'm a big fan of Ms. Ronstadt, a superlative vocalist who can sing just about anything!FEELS LIKE HOME is her 1995 return to her country/bluegrass/folk roots. Longtime pal Emmylou Harris appears on several tunes. However, not being a real bluegrass fan, my favorite tracks touch more on the more ""pop"" selections. Her cover of Tom Petty's THE WAITING certainly includes bluegrass touches but still utilizes enough rock elements to please my taste; her richly harmonized version of Neil Young's AFTER THE GOLD RUSH is notable; I enjoy the mid-tempo THE BLUE TRAIN and her heartfelt rendering rendition of Randy Newman's title track.Linda is an amazing vocalist and always brings something delicious to the musical table. FEELS LIKE HOME isn't one of my favorites but it's definitely worth tasting."
2,Not the Best Ronstadt,"After seeing mostly good reviews for this album, I felt I had to weigh in on it. This is the most boring Ronstadt album I have ever owned. Linda has a great voice and is usually a joy to listen to, but not on this album. Interestingly, 5 of the songs are duplicated on Trio II, a collaboration with Emmylou Harris and Dolly Parton. I didn't even realize it until someone pointed this out. I would get the Trio II album instead, as the versions there seem much better and include the additional voices that add richness. There are many Rondstadt albums out there better than this one."
3,A fine vegetarian cookbook,"I borrowed this from the local library. It is a nice basic collection of fairly simple vegetarian recipes using common ingredients. My general observation is that most of these recipes don't really require a recipe, so I don't need this book in my collection."
2,"Uninspired, Geared to novice cook, Not gourmet","If you already know how to cook, I wouldn't suggest this cookbook. Here's why:1) many recipes were bland and uninspired (nothing was bad, but many needed intervention to improve/add flavor)2) geared towards novice - not for the seasoned cook, and certainly not gourmet3) recipes call for dried herbs - why not use frozen fresh herbs? Just as fast and WAY better taste. I buy fresh herbs and freeze them in water in ice cube trays, then store the ice cubes in labeled ziplock bags in freezer, and always have fresh herbs available when I need them. Now THAT's fast (and cheap) gourmet.4) not enough diversity in recipes - many seem like variations of each otherMY TASTES - I've been vegetarian for ~10 years, and I prefer Mediterranean, SE Asian, Indian, English, French, and Soul food. (Read: lots of flavor, not afraid of fats or seasonings) So you should judge my opinion in context."
2,"Works, but design is flawed.","It works, but unlike previous cables I've used from Quantum, this one requires you to:A. Remove the battery door and the batteries on the flash;B. Insert the battery cable adapter into the flash and tighten in-place using a tension knob;C. The cable on my Canon 430 EX II flash has the cable sticking out on the shutter release side instead of the opposite side. It gets in the way and is cumbersome to maneuver when you are shooting fast paced sports. The battery compartment is exposed and is a potential hazard if you are shooting in wet conditions.Like I said, it works, but I ended up returning this item and will be considering other battery options such as Dynalite or refurbishing my Quantum Turbo battery to use an alternate adapter."
4,Just what it says it is.,"The product is as described, still need to be able to trouble shoot but will save time in the long run. It has resolved some PC issues with various machines that have been waiting for me to work on them. I bought this with a power supply tester and am happy I did."
1,Doesn't work,It doesn't work. Tested with a working computer and it tells me the CPU is fried. Don't waste your money
2,Does it work?,"Inserted this card into 5 pc's. It gave the same error for all pc's, including the ones that were new and working fine. My rating..... FF"
5,Great kid watch,"This is not the cheapest watch for a kid, but it fits a small wrist and is very easy for a child to drive."
3,Enough teasing in trailers,"This album is ok, its got kind of a gothic romance thing going, which is great, but when you watch the trailer, you expect a lot of hardcore, fast beat, werewolve killing music. I contacted the production company, Lakeshore Entertainment, and asked what the music in the trailer was. Its Red Tape, by Agent Provocateur, and it will be on the Underworld score, coming out soon. I like most of the songs on here, but it gets back to how do you have 19 songs on a soundtrack for a battle between werewolves and vampires, and it comes off sounding as bland as this. Ive been a Nine Inch Nails fan since they came out 15 years ago, and I think this album illustrates why Danny Lohner is more band than creative influence with Nine Inch Nails. I'm hoping the movie itself isn't quite this mellow and boring. Its a good dark edged album, but could use a swift kick in the rear to have been better."
3,"Good, But Not What I Expected","An interesting soundtrack, but not at all what I had expected. Sure Tool fans will wet themselves at the inclusion of so much Maynard James Keenen, and Wes Borland fans will no doubt love to hear his new band The Daming Well, as well as his work on Renholder, but other than that this soundtrack really doesn't have all that much that can be taken at face value.If anything it brings to mind demos from the Tapework sessions. It really just seems like a lot of thrown together tracks to promote the next endever by these groups with no substance or style. Danny Lohner you should be ashamed of yourself..."
4,Pretty much sucks...BUT...,"I hated the movie and this soundtrack blows but hey, it's got the best Finch song ever released on it...so I say 4 star. Worms of the Earth baby."
3,If you're looking for the song in the preview,"Music fan, you'll find it in ""The Jackal"" soundtrack, ""Red Tape""..."
3,kinda lame,"the movie was really bad, the soundtrack is very lackluster. the soundtrack pulls in a bunch of good names and none of them put forth any effort. i am convinced now that danny lohner is a no-talent hack. the damning well song is terrible. richard patrick should stick to singing ballads about his feelings. milla's singing is atrocious, the puscifer song is really obnoxious too. as far as i can tell, there are only three good songs on here: page hamilton, skinny puppy, and dillinger escape plan. i haven't really made it to the end of the cd. the DEP is pretty good and i usually get stuck on it. listen to the soft part at the end with the complicated rhythm--that's really amazing. all that said, the soundtrack does have a good identity and mood to it."
3,Could Have Been Better,"The record companies could have made this better somehow. The best songs on the CD: REV 22:20, And the remix of Judith. Not worth buying."
1,What a waste of incredible talent,"There are great names here (Skinny Puppy Maynard James Keenan of Tool/A Perfect Circle, Johnette of Concrete Blonde, Wes Borland, David Bowie, Danny Lohner of Nine Inch Nails, etc.). Unfortunately, most of them don't live up to their reps. The new APC is quite good, but it's mired in such mediocrity that it cannot lift the album to even a two-star rating. I paid US$10 for this and it was about nine bucks too much.I suppose hardcore NIN fans might enjoy this album since Lohner had so much to do with it (he wrote, remixed and/or performed in many of the tracks, and he also produced the whole shebang). Otherwise, skip it."
2,Misinformed,"This gets a 2 because of APC and Dillinger Escape Plan. You people are misinformed or confused, because Dillinger consists of particullarly talented musicians. You may not dig the vocals, he's not as good as their old vocalist, but the music is crazy and you gotta respect it."
1,Terrible,"If you shop at hot topic and fancy yourself a 'goth', you might like this cd (except for The Dillinger Escape Plan song, which will more than likely confuse and terrify you). If you have taste or a brain, you will skip this one and buy Miss Machine, which has a remixed version of Baby's First Coffin on it anyway."
4,Not bad,"What one would expect from an action vampire movie. Not bad.Btw, the song that plays during Michael's transformation is Perfect Circle's 'Judith' (in response to the review below me)."
1,richard patrick rocks,"I just bought this CD and the only song of quality is ""Awakening""by the Damning Well. I was looking forward to Maynard and Bowie's collaboration, but was let down by the songs soft and bland sound. I hope the movie proves to be a stronger effort than the soundtrack."
1,Mislead,After seeing the movie i was expecting a kick a$$ soundtrack. None of the songs that are in the movie are on this soundtrack. Just a warning.
3,song?,Does anyone know what the song that was played in the movie preview (near the end of the preview) is?
4,Excellent,"This is one of the few soundtracks that capture the essence of the film. The music on here is dark, loud and haunting. I believe that the frontman of Tool/A Perfect Circle, James Maynard Keenan did an excellent job of putting together an album. The stand-out tracks are ""REV22:20"", ""Throwing Punches"", ""Bring Me The Head Of The Disco King"", ""Weak and Powerless"" and the very haunting ""All Of This Past."" The only reason this didn't get five stars from me was because I felt some of the songs were a bit repetitive in sound. Not much variety. But otherwise, excellent."
2,Underworld Soundtrack,"I bought the album for the track on the movie trailer, which I quickly found out was not on there. After listening to the whole thing I found some good points but I expect a lot more from Danny Lohner(NIN). It's mostly rock tracks, so if you were looking for some new Euro hits (ie. Prodigy, Massive Attack, etc) look elsewhere.>>> If I am not mistaken the preview track is called Red Tape and its on The Jackal soundtrack which is very worth purchasing for this song and the Massive Attack classic Super Predator"
4,Full of Musics Geniuses,"I had HIGH expecations of this album. Finger prints of Danny Lohner in SO many of the songs, Maynard in three of them, one of which singing with Bowie, Renholder tracks, can't go wrong.I was unpleasantly suprised when I listend to this album through. Only because (maybe I had such high expactations) this album does not *mix* well. No sense of order or flow to it, like a funky taste in your mouth. But once you get over it going from a groaning Maynard track to a raunching Dillinger Escape track to a female sounding oddly like Tori Amos/Evanesence, this cd will not stop spinning over and over in your player."
5,The Red Tape Song From The Trailer Isn't On Here,"And as far as I'm concerned that's great news since I hated that song when it was on The Jackal and I still hate it now. Lame lyrics and terrible music. Unlike that sorry excuse for a song the soundtrack is actually pretty darn good. The standout tracks for me are Skinny Puppy's Optimissed, Puscifer's REV 22:20, and David Bowie's Bring Me the Disco King. Other great songs on here as well like Weak and Powerless which I think is even better than the original version. A great addition to anyone's collection who likes the darker side of rock music."
3,Needless censorship,"Bought this album only for the remix of ""Judith"".Censored? Why, yes, it is, but, couldn't you have mentioned that in the product description? ""FAKE your God""? Please...Other songs are decent."
4,"excellent, overall","i think anyone who enjoyed the fragile era nin would enjoy the danny lohner songs here. he creates an atmosphere in the music he mixes and composes that it just feels so right. and if you're not a fan of instrumental, the david bowie track should get you. it has been one of the most beautiful songs I've heard lately and i can't stop listening to it. Why there isn't 5 stars going to this album is because of the random songs from less than awesome bands such as finch and dillinger escape plan, but overall a great album."
3,NOT that impressive,"Please don't buy this CD if you expect any of the songs from the movie's trailer because you're not going to find any. The songs are relatively weak and scattered to listen to without watching the movie, but I'm sure that they blend in with the movie much more."
1,Missing parts and No contact page,"I received this cutter and it was only one, there is a picture of two and the description uses the word ""inserts"" to describe the product. This all implies there will be two. I have tried to contact Amazon, and cant find anyway to contact them directly without having to return the item. I can say this is the first problem I have had with amazon, but I am beyond annoyed with this."
5,AwEsOmE,"This figure isn't to play with, its to show your a freaking fan of the Spawn franchise. I thought it would be just another figurine but it sure stands out in my place. Get it!"
4,Pretty good collectible... Not such a play with toy though...,This toy is a very good addition to any spawn freak. But though it lacks in poseable points and in entertainment. I have got to say it looks pretty freakn awsome though. It looks good with a reedmeer toy. but overall a large dessapointment in entertainment.
5,Perfection itself!,"I am fortunate to have been introduced to Beethoven's late quartet works through these renditions by Cleveland Quartet. I've heard other versions since but I keep coming back to these recordings. A must have for any Beethoven Quartet fan! Its sad that the quartet disbanded in '95. I really wish they had finished a season of Mozart's ""Haydn"" quartets as well!"
5,Still my favorite,"In February of 2000, I wrote this review for Emerson's cycle, ""If you like these quartets strong and right in your face, then here you are. However, many of the delicate, intimate passages are almost brushed over as unimportant. The Cleveland Quartet does a great job with the intimate details and is highly recommended. I had access to both sets to enjoy and compare and I purchased Cleveland. However, I do appreciate the superb performances of Emerson and their smash face style that many would claim was Beethoven's priority. Cleveland is more elegant, and detail oriented and quite simply paint more beautiful pictures. Do you want Joni Mitchell or The Clash performing your Beethoven? Buy both if you can for total mood coverage and an enjoyable comparison study.""Ten years later, after listening to many more Beethoven cycles, I still prefer the beauty and detail that Cleveland offers to these great quartets."
1,Act Has Gone From Bad to Worse,"Act! 2007 is as bad a program as I have encountered. It is balky, cumbersome, slow-loading (I have a fast machine), buggy, and under-supported. It got 1 star from me because 0 stars isn't an option. If you buy this program, I promise that sometime in the next year the program will lock-up and you will not be able to access your database."
1,ACT! 2007 is the worst!!!,"I, like many others who posted here, wish I had read the reviews BEFORE buying and upgrading the software. After a long and hard time with NO HELP from Sage (approximately 12 hours total) I got our company's two users up and kind of working. I can't even get to the Knowledge Base that was so helpful with earlier versions. At least when you had problems with the earlier versions you could find a well written document with a useful work-around or solution. We had used ACT! since the two floppy disk version (our first laptop had no hard drive) and loved it through the upgrade to version 6. Were it not for the loss of data since the conversion I would go back right now to the older version, and we may have to do that anyway. ACT! 7 is SLOW, causes problems interacting with other programs, including our XP operating system, and is a major frustration we don't need. Don't buy this product!!!!!"
1,Can't wait to get rid of it!!!! ZERO STARS,"I have struggled with this software for six months, and like many other reviewers, I would like to give this ZERO stars. I have used ACT for over 10 years, and have always been very pleased. This version is a disaster--EXTREMELY slow memory hog, backup and restore is virtually impossible. I am completely frustrated and sorry I ""upgraded"" to this version. We will be converting (at significant expense) to other software as soon as possible. Why couldn't Sage just leave it alone?"
1,Terrible,It is difficult to use words harsh enough to describe this product and this company.I have owned this software for about 80 days.1. In 80 days of use this product has completely locked up or not opened twice.2. I have called the 'support' line 4 times. The minimum time I was on hold was 40 minutes.3. My initial 'support' period is about to expire and I now will have to pay $200 to get more 'support'4. You have to buy additional software to get your data onto a palm device.In summary: The product has locked up about every 40 days and the average hold time is 40 minutes when you call them.Save yourself the grief - buy nothing or buy something else.
4,Very Pleased!,Received my order very quickly and in good order. All my info from Act 2000 transferred over without a hitch. Very pleased so far.
2,Wrong version,My fault because I thought it would work on my vista. I wanted to convert an older database (Act 4.0) but it didn't work.
1,"You get what you pay for, most of the time.","I was looking for a version of Act that would be compatible with others in my office without paying a lot. What I got was not what I expected. I was unable to install it on my laptop as it was always giving me an error ""Invalid drive F:"". I will keep looking for a copy that will install without problems."
4,This program with Act for the Palm,"I have read all the reviews and I have to tell you, the program has worked well for me. The program might take slightly longer to load, but the new look is so much nicer then the past version 6.0 that I had. I am use this with Act for the Palm and it works so well so when I am out and about on my sales calls, I can get access to my customer information on the go as it gives you the look and feel like your using act on your computer. I recommend this to anyone who is in sales to help keep organized."
5,Another good Amazon experience,"I just needed another copy of ACT. As always, I found what I needed on Amazon. The product was shipped quickly, packed well and was exactly as represented. Can't ask for more. As far as the product ACT is concerned, it's a contact manager that pretty much will do anything you want it to do. I couldn't begin to give an extensive review here. It just works."
3,Act! 2007,"I have used Act!2000 and liked it very much. It was when Act! was owned by Symantec. Since Sage now owns and sells Act!2007, I have noticed a reduced command response when using the database. It runs slower and the features aren't that much greater than MS Outlook (no junk mail folders to guard against spam - this is a big issue when using any business email). This really disappoints me - since I loved the original Act! database from Symantec. I'm not tempted to upgrade to Act!2009 either.Anyway, I used a gift card to purchase Act!2007 so I'm really not out any money myself.I would not recommend this product. I hope Sage sells this classic database back to Best and they sell it back to Symantec!Order #: 002-1863780-1473027"
1,Act 2007 Was the WORST Software Product I Ever Bought,"What a mistake I made!!! Unlike past versions, ACT 2007 is an unmitigated disaster: Takes up too much memory, is extremely sluggish, crashes often, has trouble hot-synching with handheld devices, and may not recognize your passwords (meaning that you have to pay Sage Software's technical support for even more of your money to fix their own problems). After this fiasco I cannot in good conscience buy any more Sage products. Try using Amicus instead."
1,ACT 2007 is so bad -- How could it have gotten worse.,I have been an ACT user since 1988 version 1.0 DOS. Yes I said DOS. I upgraded to version 2006 last year and shelved the product due to the speed issues and stability problems.Recently I had to retrieve one contact from act. I had the back-up database but the program had been removed so I downloaded the new version 2007.Suprisingly it performs much better but and it is a big But! The calendar will not display anything but 5 little ones and the year is 2017. SO much for planning ahead. There is no reference to this in the knowledge base and tech support will not take my calls.I got so fed up with Sage that I sent them a demand notice and threat to sue them on 2006. They just sent me a release and are reimbursing me for the original purchase over a year ago....How could their programmers missed a small feature like calendars?
2,ACT 2007 not as good as ACT 2004,I was perfectly happy with mt ACT 6.0 2004. I fell for the pitch announcing the 2007 release saying that version 6.0 would no longer be supported. I upgraded and have regreted it ever since. It is slow as H*ll. Glitchy and just doesn't work as well as 2004.The ACT tech support people seem to be friendly but do not speak English. I just had to give up on them because I couldn't understand what they were saying and they couldn't understand me either.My advice- DO NOT UPGRADE!!! 2004 is still the best version.
2,Act 2007 doesn't work with Vista,"I had Act 2003 working on 3 computers, then I had to upgrade to 2007 because Sage wouldn't support the older version any more. I had to get a new CPU for one system for the Act 2007 to work on it. Then another system crashed and I had to buy a new one. This one has to have Vista on it because that's what they all come with now. So I get Act installed on the new Vista operating system and find out it doesn't work on Vista, so now, after 1 year of use, I have to upgrade to 2008 for the new system which won't sync with the other computers anymore...I don't understand why they pushed so hard for everyone to buy a system that won't work on any new computer and why they just can't do a fix for 2007! What a rip off!"
2,Very bad version of ACT!,"ACT! is one of thos applications that's been ""passed off"" over the years. It used to be by Symantec, then Best Software, now Sage! Sage tends to make very user unfriendly software and is unintuitive. You are almost forced to purchase a service plan with them because of their complicated software & bugs. This new version of ACT is no different! I waisted about 3 hours trying to install and get this program to work properly before giving up and going back to ACT! 2005 by Best Software which installed and worked fine in a matter of about 10 minutes. So unless your planning on waisting lots of time with this version by Sage & spending hours on the phone with Tech Support, then I would recommend purchasing an older version that is NOT released by Sage!"
1,Ruined A Good Product,"Stay away from this software. I was a loyal and happy ACT customer for 8 years until I upgraded to this version, so I'm really sad to say that this version is a total nightmare. I've experienced tremendous problems, including being locked out of my database altogether. This software also glitched up my computer and basically brought the entire thing down at one point. If it wasn't for the fact that I have a super-techie husband, I never would have been able to retrieve my data or get things running (hobbling) again. Tech support is entirely WORTHLESS!!! Sorry, but find another product. I feel like I have no choice but to start searching other contact managers now. Bummer!!!!"
1,Wow-I never thought it would be this bad!,"I read all of the reviews, and saw how bad this product was rated. However, I also found (after 3 tech support calls) that if you want to use Act! for Palm, you need to upgrade to the new version if you want it to work with your other software. I reluctantly upgraded as I wanted these systems to work. After two days on the phone with Tech support it was determined that my machine would not install the program (even though the system was less than a year old and met all of the system requirements). It was suggested that I go and purchase a new machine. Unfortunately, now I will need to restore the older version! I wonder how long it will take to get that one working again! Act! is the only program I have had problems with. I wish Sage could write a program that actually did what was advertised!"
1,Wipes Out All Your Appointments on Palm Pilot,"Hello!I have used ACT! since ACT! for DOS and I never, ever thought I'd stop using this product. I always LOVED it!But I give up. This is NOT your Father's Act!The program is now horrendous. It is way too slow, way too time consuming to be a time saver, foolishly designed and quite unreliable.USE anything other than this program. Stick to a Rolodex. Tie strings on your fingers. Put sticky-notes all over your house -- but, especially do this one very important thing:VOTE with your money -- and don't even consider supporting this product or company. Putting out this nasty software is tantamount to committing violence against all of the millions of users that rely on it and made the Publisher's very wealthy. This product is now truly junk.This program is really THAT bad. STAY FAR AWAY..Buyer Beware!Mark"
1,Heed the warnings of current ACT users,Try Contact Plus Professional instead. It works--unlike ACT--and it's very easy to learn to use. They even have an ACT conversion for people who are fed up with ACT.
1,Lots of money for what?,"I have been an ACT! user for years. Actually started with ACT! 5 several years ago.I decided to buy this program so that it would sync with my Treo 700wx. Really the only reason I bought it. Did that only a year and a half ago. It worked great until...I go to buy a new system with Windows Vista. Come to find out, this program will not allow sync with a PDA in Vista. So the biggest reason I bought it was now moot.Now I am bombarded with e-mails asking me to upgrade for another $199 to ACT! 10 so that I can have the functionality I paid for in the first place. Most companies make a patch or something for Vista and offer it for free...NOT SAGE.Instead of upgrading ACT!, I kept this version and bought Outlook 2007 for seamless sync with my PDA.Sage has lost me as a customer probably forever. Great product IMO, just bad corporate policies."
1,Returned to Amazon,"I have used ACT! for 17 years and need the product for my work. I upgraded this year from Act!2004 because Sage discontinued support. Act!2007 is a huge disappointment for this user and my two assistants. Luckily, my company has a person who can troubleshooot Act!2004 so we have gone back to it and RETURNED ACT! 2007, for a full refund."
1,Dont buy the 2007 upgrade,"I echo the other negative comments. We have used Act for years, and the support was never stellar. Now the support is nonexistent. It causes every system we have to fail. We have done every equipment upgrade they suggested, and it only seemed to make matters worse. We are trying to get our money back and are going to go back to the older version. This program is terrible."
1,A huge rip off,"I have used ACT since the early 1990's. Recently received a notice from ACT! by Sage that I needed to upgrade as they were not doing any updates on previous versions.WELL, what a mistake. I spent the money for ACT! 2007, then spent another $200 for tech support. After 8 tries talking to their support people, I still can not load the program. I am trying to load it on a brand new machine, nothing wrong with the computer.I have been promised return calls, but not any answers. $370 later, I have a nice book to read, an old ACT! program that they don't support anymore, and a new one that they can not load."
1,Caveat emptor,"I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing two ACT 2007 upgrade copies for our small business. Other reviewers have described their experiences with Sage tech support , so I will spare you a repetition.In my case (following a solid two day effort to get things working) Sage's fix was to disable the Windows Firewall. Our outside IT consultants called this solution ""insane"" and advised against it.In the end, we had to remove the upgrades and revert to the previous ACT version (add another fun experience with Sage's Tech Support...).Sage agreed to take the software back (shipping cost - ours) and issue a full refund in ""about 4 to 6 weeks after receipt"", which is considerably longer than the one day it took them to charge my credit card.My advice - do not buy it. If you do, make sure to have at least a one day supply of food and water in your office before calling Sage tech support."
1,I wish I had read reviews before I purchased the aweful product,"I have read all 34 reviews hoping to find a glimer of hope with all of my probablems. Everything I read is exactly what I have experienced. I have been an ACT user since 1998. I am looking for something else or maybe my bosses will let me downgrade to 2005! I was so excited and didn't even read or research the negatives. .Everything has been said, so I can't add to it!!! Maybe stockholders will read this information which is the only reason I added to the site. I didn't buy from Amazon.Lynette"
1,DO NOT BUY IS PROGRAM!!!,I bought the ACT 2007 based on recommendations from a friend who uses and earlier version. I wish I had read more reviews before purchasing.There is no support for this software. You can not speak to a technical support person without first keying in a credit card number. If you talk to a customer service representative all they want to do is sell you a service plan for either $299 or $199.They claim the email will work with Outlook. Everytime I use their email my computer gives an error message and then crashes.I read in an earlier review that someone was thinking about a class action lawsuit. I would love to testify in that trial.The bottom line is if I could get my money back I would.
1,Nothing but problems from the start,"I used Act! before and decided to upgrade to Act! 2007. The program has NOT worked properly since installing the program about two months ago. I keep getting a fatal ""Failed to open a connection to the database"" which promptly shuts down the program. The Act! online support group uninstalled and reinstalled the program. After one week, the fatal error message returned. Since my 60 days of free online support is scheduled to expire in early December, I decided to return the software to Sage and ask for a full refund rather than be caught in a position of having to purchcase online support for $299/year or get stuck with a software I can't use. I've have never purchased a program with so much problems after initial installation."
2,oh boy is this mislabelled,"I played this during a massage, as generally music that is advertised as relaxing or romantic makes good massage music. This one started out all right, it advertises itself as ""exquisite melodies for that perfect evening."" But there is a 13 minute organ selection that sounds like a funeral. And then there is the March of the Toreadors. I was trying not to laugh until I realized my client was snickering - we both laughed pertty hard. Just so NOT relaxing or a good match for ""that perfect evening."""
2,NOT HEAVY DUTY,"So disappointing! When I opened the package and felt the weight of the curtain, it became very clear that it is just like any other curtain. There is nothing heavyweight about it."
5,Thick and effective,"This is the first cheap plastic shower curtain that does not seek out your naked body faster than Ted Bundy in the girls dorm. It stays put even in the steamiest shower. It smells like the inside of a Hyundai for about a week, but once you get past that, its a charmer."
2,poor quality,"The material seems to be good but the quality of construction is poor. The seams are unevenly made and were not trimmed after. We bought the Carnation bone shower window curtains along with these 10-gauge shower curtains and paid $35 for both including shipping. DEFINITELY not worth that price. We would have done better going down to our local WallyWorld and buying their cheapest junk. We are very disappointed with the window curtains, the shower curtain AND with Amazon.com for selling this garbage."
1,Mildew on the Shower Curtain,I bought this shower curtain and there is mildew on it. I would like another shower curtain or my money back.
2,"seems durable, but definitely not ""rust proof"" steel grommet reinforced holes","used it for less than 3 weeks. no mildew yet, but the ""rust proof"" steel grommet reinforced holes already fully rusted to 12 big red brownish circles...update========================got another one of this 3 months ago. this one doesn't have any mildew and the steel grommets hasn't shown any sign of rust. those rusted steel grommets on the first one was a matter of QA?"
5,Shower curtain,"I am really happy with this shower curtain. It is beautifully clear, it feels like a quality product, and it opens up my bathroom. I have a friend that bought one because he saw mine. Trust my word. You will not be disappointed."
4,Heavy Duty!,"My husband purchased this for his bathroom. He said it is a great thick vinyl shower curtain. He needs only occasionally to clean it down but it's great! He said he will not need to purchase a new one. So far, it's lasted several years!"
1,Buyer Beware,"These are Carnation brand, made in China. I bought two. One was fine, the other had a 1/4"" tear in the side and the bottom edge appeared to have been chewed off, not cut. When I pay $14 for a shower curtain liner, I expect it to be of consistent quality. If ordering again, I'd pick a different brand. I NEEDED these lousy things before the holidays, so I haven't figured out how to get a replacement for the one bum one and have it before my company arrives. I'm ticked!"
1,Not as advertised,The ad said heavy gauge and soft as silk. I read the reviews and decided to try it. I was really disappointed with it. It is not heavy gauge ( I have another one that is heavy and this does not compair with it. Also it said soft as silk - sorry I have never felt silk like this. It is like cardboard. Really unhappy with it.
2,Huge smell!,"Huge smell when I open the bag! I can't wait to return it! Now I purchased another one, mod resistant and no odd in Walmart, even cheaper than this one!"
1,NOT mildew resistant!,"This shower curtain has a SIGNIFICANT amount of mildew on it after only using it for a month. No shower curtain that I've purchased has ever mildewed that quickly. It's frustrating since it says ""WILL NOT MILDEW"" real big on the package and now I have to spend more time, effort and money to find a new one. There's no excuse for that to happen since I have an exhaust fan in my bathroom and there are only 2 people using the shower each day. The only good thing about it is it's much thicker than a normal shower curtain but who cares now that I have to replace it so quickly? Jeez!Update: After 2 months, grommets are rusting even though they claim to be ""rust proof"". Nice."
1,smelly shower liner,The plastic smell is horrendous and it took two of us 15 min to open it ---folded like origami and the folds were difficult to find ---it stuck to itself in a death grip ---I bought it for the no mildew but I sure hope the smell dissipates--would not purchase again
5,Shower curtain,Finally a shower curtain that doesn't mold. Well worth the price and will definetly save you some money in the long run. Thanks!
3,Premature Death,I bought this Panasonic because my sister had hers for 10+ years. This one didn't last much over 3 years. I am so disappointed.I had to cut back the cook times because it does cook faster. It does heat evenly and was easy to clean. It still looks brand new.
2,was great...til it quit working,"I really expect more than a year and a half of use from a microwave. This one started doing some very strange, unnerving things, like turning on when the door was OPENED. Couldn't shake the image of microwaving my hand some morning when I was half asleep. That was enough to scare me into sending it to the recycler. Bummer too, because it was a very nice looking appliance."
2,beware import taxes,"couldn't find this product in UK, so it wasn't simply a case of trying to save a buck. however, the delivery company ensured that i had to pay around 50 in import duties. this was a bit annoying for a 20 item.the item is OK."
5,The Brave Adventures of Lapitch,"Ivana Brlic Mazuranic book about little orphaned apprentice Lapitch is endearing to the heart and soathing for the soul as a drop of morning dew. Emotinally abused by an angry shoemaker Mrdus, Lapitch bravely escapes the shop in discarded leather boots, looking for a happier life. His fasty spirit is galloping through the chapters radiating humor, sadness, and gusto for life. Anne from Green Gables you have found a soulmate."
4,Great pictures under most lighting conditions.,"See my posted images. Cloudy days, sunny days, nights, dusk, indoors - this camera takes them all using the ""natural"" (nonflash) mode, which is less artificial looking than flash. Comes with everything except a larger memory card ([...]) Good battery life, and recharges in couple hours. Easy to take short movie clips, which load onto computer just like the photos with included Finepix software and included dock and USB connector wire. Dock has tripod mount on bottom.The only negative is that it does not have a viewfinder (little hole you peek in with one eyeball), meaning that you must compose photos using large LCD screen. The LCD screen is hard to see on sunny days. Just take several ""blind"" shots and crop."
1,very disapointed,"It took great pictures while it lasted. Then the battery would not hold a charge, so I bought a new one; but the same scenario. Guess I have to call Fuji repair center and see what I can do. The camera is 8 months old and quit holding the charge after 6 months. I'm always inserting the battery just before taking pictures which is a pain in the neck because I have to reset the date and time each time and never know how fast the camera is going to quit on me again.Also I cannot use it with a tripod; they should have pointed that out, some features one just takes for granted in this time and age.I also do not like that you cannot zoom in/out with the video feature and when you playback you always have to slide the shutter close and open again before taking more pictures - very annoying and time consuming if you want to take snapshots.I do too have white circles on the picture when using the flash. Boy, I sure wasted my money on this camera."
3,"Foggy lens, movable lens cover, poor flash","Cons:- The lens cover often slides off in my pocket. Fortunately, the camera will shut down if not in use.- I often see faint white circles in my flash photography. The cause is spots on the lens, which may or may not be caused by the problem above. I have to repeatedly wipe off the lens. If the camera had a permanent lens cover, I would not have to do this.- The Fujifilm site claims the camera has a smart flash that will not over-brighten subjects. I have not found this to be the case. The flash is as bad as most cameras.- No tri-pod fitting. This would be handy as an attachment point for a video light.Pros:The video is good, but no light."
5,fantastic,"This is the latest in a long line of excellent and diverse work by Monica Richards. While she is most famous for her work in the ""Goth Scene"", this goes far beyond that. Spoken word and techno-Afro beat is all part of this and more. Listen to track #3 ""Fell to Regret"" first. This song rocks!"
2,Too small!!,I just got fitted at a store and tried on this brand in my new size. I decided to order it on-line to save money...well you get what you pay for!! I ordered a 32F and the cup size looks like maybe a B cup! Not happy. I was looking forward to lifting these puppies up! It does look like it would be a good bra though...if it fit. :/I am a female. MatthewMCRepair is my husband. And he does not wear a bra. :)
5,I LOVED THIS BOOK!,"This book is a must read for students of medicine, psychology, counseling, social work, and health related fields! Dr. Chang provides insightful and educated information concerning helpful and harmful behaviors of helping professionals. Her description of her cancer treatment was detailed and realistic. I could not put the book down! Dr. Chang's emotions and behaviors during various stages of her treatment were very similar to my experience undergoing treatment for colon cancer. I think that this book will give the average population an awareness of what it is like to have cancer!"
2,Good for very basic information.,"This is a very basic beginners book. It is not well versed on disease and treatment. However, my 2 year old likes the photos!"
2,Good for begginers,"A good book for begginers. The title misguides the reader into thinking it is a complete reference for goldfish. The author briefly touches many of the topics. I regret buying this book because it did not solve my questions about diseases, plant care, water quality, and nutrition. A good book for kids. Nice photographs."
4,Goldfish review,Very informative. This book had some information that I was looking for. I especially found the section on goldfish varieties helpful.
2,Horrible that such a good anime gets this packaging.,I have all of the previous seasons of Galaxy Angel and enjoyed them. When I purchased this one I sadly did not pay attention to the running time.It has one 30 minute episode. For the current Amazon price 17.99 this is way overpriced.The episode itself is very good but sadly the company making this decided to cash in on the fans. I will wait for a season box set to come out.
5,Darn near 10 years since its release.,Nobody and Twisted everyone knows are 2 great jams. But for some reason 'Just a Touch' is my favorite and it really makes me feel like it's 1996-1997. And those were good and fun times as a kid when there was only just a touch of BS you had to deal with while having a great time with life.
4,a good disc,i really dug Twisted&nobody.Keith Sweat for me is hit or missed.Make it Last forever is his best.his 2nd album was good and this one as well.but in between it's been a few good songs and alot of clunkers.this is pretty consistent.
4,great,Great product thank you so much for this. I had this cd a long time ago and disappered. So thank u
2,A Little Disappointing...,This video wasn't exactly what I expected. It is presented in a lecture style that young students find boring.
3,Mediocre,"This cd was just ok, it has some amazing songs like ""Fruta Fresca"" but i've he has better cds."
5,Cascara Sagrada Bark,"great product, I've use it a few times and have been very pleased. it sure help to eliminate the crap out of you. nothing work like Cascara Sagrada Bark to relief constipation you have to follow the instruction"
5,Funky Stuff... Great Vocals,"I downloaded the MP3's and was very impressed. The samples sound very live and the music is complex... I enjoy bands like Beatnicks to Massive attack and this album is definitely ""reco mended""!!"
5,These guys are fantastic. Watch them soar.,"Brilliant sequencing and smooth textures. For their first release, this album demonstrates musical maturity and creativity that is fitting for a seasoned trip-hop outfit. Throbbing basslines and intricate drum-loops ground the ethereal layers and samples. The atmospherics create a background for haunting vocals and well developed melodies. The production is great too. You have to listen to the album on a surround-sound system to catch the little nuances. Very nice record, up there with Massive Attack, Portishead and Tricky in my book. My favorites are ""En Passing"", ""Motion Picture' and the instrumental ""Amsterdam Room"""
3,"Soothing, entertaining, yet lacking","I would say this album is just good, not stellar but not bad. Many of the songs in fact are quite good, but it also suffers from several of the tracks that are very forgettable. Perhaps it is because many of the songs have the same feel/sound, that it's hard for many of them to stand out very much. If you really want to give Karmacoda a listen, I would highly recommend listening to their new album first,Illuminate. I feel that it's much more polished and certainly better. Then get this one, because sometimes average is still worth it."
4,This album has really grown on me.,"When I first heard this album, it did not make much of an impression on me. The first song still doesn't, actually. What I love about this album is that it's sources are so eclectic (just look at who's on it), but every song has this twangy, country feel to it that's not exactly right because it's country done by a bunch of Britons. I especially love ""Rake at the Gates of Hell,"" ""Evil Darling,"" ""Money, Guns and Coffee,"" and ""Big Nothing."" If anyone can get me the lyrics to the second and third ones, it would be greatly appreciated. The country version of ""If I Should Fall From Grace With God"" is really interesting for anyone who has ever heard the version on the Pogues album of the same name."
5,Absolutely Wonderful Game!,"I purchased this game for my daughter's 4th. birthday. She loves it and we do too! She had already learned her capital letters, but didn't know many lower case letters or the letter sounds. I couldn't seem to find a fun way to teach these to her and she lost interest very quickly under my instruction :) However, after only having the Letter Factory for just one day, she could recognize both upper and lower case letters and had learned (really learned) the letter sounds. I couldn't be more pleased with this game. I thought that after getting the Finding Nemo and Disney Princess games that she wouldn't play with this one much, but so far my ""little princess"" prefers the Letter Factory even over her favorite Disney characters."
5,the best cartridge EVER MADE,"My daughter just turned 5 last week. We have done countless workbooks together and the only area I had trouble teaching to her was phonics. I purchased this cartridge at a local walmart at xmas for the long ride to the in-laws. In all seriousness, she LEARNED phonics within an hour. I CANNOT tell you how awesome this cartridge is. Her favorite is to call out a letter now and we take turns coming up with 5 words that begin with this letter. This has progressed to her reading short words and the ability to sound something out. There is a silly song with the cartridge that keeps her in stitches when the letters go thru an assembly line and an error is discovered in a letter sound..She listens to this cartridge DAILY and never ceases to be bored with it. she could care less about the Dora tape, but this one and the Kindergarten are EXCELLENT. a 10 star rating if I could..."
2,Pretty Boring,"This is more a video than an actually game. My son has learned the sounds but we also have Letters on the Loose, which is a game and he enjoys that much more. Letters on the Loose also teaches them the sounds and letters but in a more game style fashion. I can't see Letter Factory entertaining him more than a few times since it take's half and hour to watch the whole video, which will get boring for everyone."
3,not entertaining,this should of been a great product but it bores my son and he is 3 almost. We bought this because he likes watching little video and this was perfect but it doesn't his his attention at all. Leapster is a wonderful product they just need better video's and games for it. waiting for the preschool stuff.Yvonne of San Francisco
2,Best suited for 3-4 year olds,"I was so excited to purchase this for my soon to be 5 year old daughter after reading the reviews. Well, she hates it. In her own words, ""It's boring."" She is fairly advanced for her age, and doesn't find any of the games challenging enough and isn't interested in the video either. Try Spongebob instead for anyone over 4."
1,My daughter hates it,I bought the leapster for my daughter for Christmas along with this cartridge. She wouldn't touch it after seeing and playing with this game. I took her back to the store to purchase another cartridge and she loves the machine now. I think it is very slow for a 4 - 5 year. I think my daughter is advance as well but I didn't like it at all. The other cartridges are much better.
3,okay,"This book had some cool stuff to read, but not worth the price. I think with some simple google searches you could cover what's in this book."
1,Book of Secrets,"When I was a kid, I'd read these books about unsolved mysteries of the world, featuring things like the Bermuda Triangle and Area 51 and other random factoids. This is what I was expecting. Instead, I got a misogynistic book with questionably accurate ""facts"". Some of these were just plain contrived, misleading, shaming factoids, getting right down to guides on how to manipulate women. No, thank you. The only favorable aspect of this book is the completely context-free line, ""confidence is like catnip"", which has ended up achieving meme status in my life. This is a book to stay far away from."
2,Not really secrets,"Most of these are uncommon bits of knowledge but definitely not secrets. Many are opinions of one sort or another and the kind of advice you could find in many, much better written books. A lot are outdated (like how to get an upgrade on an airline). I would not recommend this book.One other thing I noticed. A few of the reviewers seem fake. They reviewed this item and a few others on the same day but nothing else."
3,Not as Big as it seems,A nice mix of facts and random info. The only problem it is small. It really is A novelty book.
2,"Neat little book, that's about it","Its a decent little book, not the best. Most of the stuff in here isn't very interesting though. The pages are bound rather weirdly too so its hard to actually read through it."
3,not really what I expected but ok,not really what I expected but ok ok. I thought I was ordering a different book. next time I'll know
4,Great Book!,"This was a great book, though somewhat small, that shipped fast and on time. Would love doing business with this seller again!"
2,Bathroom Reading,"I bought this book for a good bathroom read. There really is only so many times I can thumb through an Entertainment Weekly; especially when they add 20 extra pages of filling and pass it off as a double issue. I thought this was gonna be a good book. So good in fact that i didnt bother to read the reviews. Well, whoa nelly! When i got the book in the mail and opened it up it dropped out of my hands and almost went down the floor vent. This thing is way too small for a bathroom read. Sure, it's got 140 pg but them pages are small even for midgets. When I toilet read I place the material right smack dab on the floor between my ankles so I can use my feet to flip the pages. Not with this little tome. And I really don't think I'm gonna get past more than one session before it's been read. Guess i'll just pull Bill Simmons, ""The Big Book of Basketball"" off the shelf and that'll get me through til Xmas."
2,Secrets or just facts,"I thought this book would have all kinds of awesome stuff in it that most Americans don't know, but it was really just facts. It was really disappointing."
3,Just OK,"The first secret of this book is that it's quite small. The secrets within vary from fascinating to mundane. Since the secrets are in no particular order, I'd recommend just thumbing through the pages, stopping to read any secrets which interest you."
5,Thundercats is Back!,I've always hoped that Thundercats would be back on DVD soon since other 80's cartoons have made a comeback. I've looked on Ebay but always saw *dodgy* sets. I must say I was thoroughly impressed with this DVD. The picture and sound quality are awesome! I just hope the distributor will be able to get more episodes released soon! Buy this DVD to add to your collection.
1,Bootleg-Don't Buy!,This disc is NOT an official release. It is an illegal bootleg. Want Thundercats? Wait for the official Warner Brothers box set that's due this year and don't waste your cash on this imitation.
1,Bootleg all the way.,"I bought this and while it was shrinkwrapped it WAS NOT factory sealed. It is infact a bootleg, aq very good bootleg, anyone these days can go and use ANY of the DVD authoring software and Photoshop and create there own DVDs that look just as good as store boughten stuff, it all depends on the source of the video. But this along with She-Ra and many others here on Amazon.com are bootlegs Warner Borthers is the only company releasing Thundercats, BCI is the only company releasing He-man and She-Ra DVDs. Please save your money. Go to websites like: http://www.tvshowsonDVD.com and do a search beofre you buy your fav cartoon, make sure it has a real release they will have the news there first."
5,A Very Good Import,"This Thundercats DVD is definitely a good DVD. Given the other regions listed on the DVD (1,2 & 4), I knew it was an import. Besides that, it is also mentioned in the description of the DVD as well. The DVD has the 1st 5 episodes of the show and the quality is definitely there. Hopefully more volumes will follow?? *hoping* If you have been looking to add some good old nostalgia to your DVD collection, this should be included on your shelf."
5,My Boyfriend Just Loves This DVD,"I just recently bought this DVD for my boyfriend and he just loves it to death. Who knew a cartoon about ""cat-people"" would make a 25yr old grown man cry with joy..."
4,Very good but not great,"The reviewer ""ivorx"" has hit the essence of this performance right on. David needs to relax when the music calls for it. Torroba is not an intense composer and needs to flow in a more relaxed state. However, this is a very good CD of great guitar music by one of the guitar's greatest composers. I really wish more of Torroba's guitar concertos would be recorded by quality musicians."
2,thought I was getting more.,I thought I was getting all the videos in the picture and all I got was one DVD. I was very disappointed.
4,An animated Jonah,"This is a half-hour, animated video of the biblical book of Jonah. Unlike some other videos in this series, this one is regular 2-D animation, not claymation. It's well written and suitable for both kids and adults. Jonah is portrayed as a total curmudgeon, which is entertaining and in keeping with the biblical text. I use a lot of videos in teaching the Hebrew Scriptures to juniors at a Catholic prep school, and this one works well for that purpose.You can also get ""Jonah"" ina set of four, along with ""Creation and the Flood"" (which is OK), ""Abraham"" (another good one), and ""Elijah"" (peculiar: a cartoon with Mendelssohn's ""Elijah"" oratorio as the score). I also recommend ""Ruth."""
2,too immature,A child who is ready for multiplication will not tolerate the silly pre-school level of this production. Any possible math learning was overwhelmed by the slapstick.
3,Make sense. Not too boring.,"This DVD is a 2008 copy from a very old copy (probably from 80s?). The content is made to be engaged and funny. It's about a conversation with a real person and a puppet dog. It also reviewed the math multiplication facts. I saw the review said it's way too boring but I don't think it's the case. If your child is always stimulated by the lastest TV shows and computer games. This might not be something interesting to him. However, if the child seldom sees TV, this might actually be interesting and not too boring. I don't regreat buying this. Since it's just $4.99, I think you might like to try it."
5,this cd is an uplifting piece of work,"Hello, I am 14 years old and I know that most of you wouldn't expect me to be listening to Nanci Griffith, and normally, I wouldnt, but while my mother had this cd out of the library, I would hear it all the time and I grew to love it. I now listen to it constantlyand and i enjoy it more and more each time. It is definately a great cd."
2,Nanci Griffith with no Country folk in any song.,This album has no country-folk in it as in so many of her recordings. It was too pop oriented for me.
2,Can't help but feel like a Chris Ware imitator...,"The tragic events in 'Mother Come Home' viewed through the eyes of a child unfold through a simple color scheme in a world that mirrors our own but stripped of detail. The lack of detail works both for and against the book: some panels are cleverly composed; others, a bit lazy.This is not the superior craftsmanship level of Chris Ware and intentional or not, it can't help but feel like a poor imitator. Toward the last part of the book, even the final tragedy feels forced. Chris Ware was able to inject empathy throughout his masterwork 'Jimmy Corrigan' and its something Hornschemeier never quite accomplishes. Its as though he felt compelled to drive the plot points to their most extreme existential, tragic end which leaves the reader feeling, well... nothing."
1,"horrible, horrible book","Paul thanks Chris Ware in the Acknowledgements, and this makes the book all the more painful to read. Jimmy Corrigan is hailed as the greatest graphic novel to date, and Paul borrows Chris Ware's name and style to create a book that tries to force sympathy from the reader. Read Jimmy Corrigan and Mother Come Home side by side and the difference will be glaringly obvious.Also: Paul doesnt ""successfully tell a tragic story in half the space it would take in a novel"". He just writes it badly and thus gets it over soon. It took me less than an hour to read this book."
4,Really cool learning tool!,"I would not call this a toy, as it's not something you would play with per se, but it is a fantastic learning instrument. My son and I put ours together rather easily, once I figured out just what the directions were trying to instruct me to do (no words, just a ton of numbers randomly strewn about). But, the dino is really, really cool, and realistic. My son has his assembled, standing on top of his book case. Sometimes he'll bring it down and make it ""walk around & roar"", but it's best as an educational tool. Well made, really like it & will purchase the other dinos."
3,Typical Stasheff,"This book is a typical example of Stasheff's ""A Wizard In..."" series. If you like others you'll probably like this one."
5,Really Good!,"This CD brings back many memories and has many great songs on it. If you like 70's-80's soft rock, you should love this. I remember these songs from my child/teen years and they still sound great! Timeless songs, indeed!"
3,Excellent design,"Excellent design, wonderful quality. Would prefer if it came in different sizes (smaller) if one wanted a less noticeable mark. I recommend it to anyone who would like to use it as a sample before getting the real thing."
3,Its a groovy CD!,"Music is good with energetic sound. Forget final cut-bad choice! Dave continues Eurythmic's type music, along lines of what could have been, had the group continued."
2,Hardly worth your time.,"The author states in a lot of pages what should be condensed to a primer. Even beginners can fall asleep reading this book the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or even 5th time the same point is presented. ZZZZZZ's!"
2,Not even worth it for beginners,"I stopped reading after 250 pages. It's a lot of blablabla, and it doesn't even gives all the basics. It gives *some* basics, but then you expect more, and what it does is explaining how to install Windows servers. If you work on other system than Windows, you might also get quite frustrated. One of (if not) the best network operation system, FreeBSD, is not even mentioned. Who takes security and performance seriously doesn't install a Windows network. I skipped the second part of the book. It's not even technical regarding Red Hat configuration. For Linux, you need to know command lines rather that knowing how to use a GUI. Click ""Next"", every one knows. How about real thourough basics of networking? It would have been a lot more useful that giving tips on whether to buy your hardware at Radioshack or BestBuy. Anyway, I'm going to look for something more serious. Too sad."
1,Why do we need another Elvis greatiest hits of his movies?,"Fans, Friends, and readers lean me your eyes on this column... For an extra you can have whats on that CD plus 30 more songs on a 2 CD set called ELVIS COMMAND PERFORMANCE essential vol 2. So why did RCA put this CD out when 2 years ago they had E.C.P out. You get a about 50 songs total from a good selection on his best songs from each movie from the 60's. Do your money a favor... get more for your money and look for that 2 CD's set and ignore this CD that came out... just looking out for my Elvis Fans and Friends."
5,A Neglected Masterpiece,"I know Elvis's movie music has been ridiculed, and put down, but this CD is a gem. Songs like ""King Creole"", ""I Can't Help Falling In Love With You"", ""Viva Las Vegas"", ""Teddy Bear"", ""Love Me Tender"", and ""Hard Headed Woman"" are certifiable classics which are found here. But the reason to get this CD, is some of the hard to find songs such as ""Follow That Dream"", ""Kissin Cousins"", and ""King Of The Whole Wide World"", which are excellent songs, that are very much overlooked, when discussions of the music of Elvis's come up. What is great, about this CD, is you avoid some of the garbage material that Elvis sang in his movies (""Girls, Girls, Girls"" comes to mind), and get nothing but quality.Simply put this is a bargain CD, and a neglected masterpiece, that should be purchased by every Elvis fan."
5,Viva Hollywood,If you like to hear songs from Elvis movies this CD is a good choice. What's really best about this CD is that all the songs are good. They sound very good as well. This is a well thought out collection of songs that represents the contribution Elvis made to the cinema.
4,great knife,"2 stars for advertising. but 4 stars for the knife.A litte ticked at the advertising, it was assumed that I was buying a Carbon V blade SRK, mainly because it said "" This is a Carbon V blade"" Made in U.S.Abut nope I got the Japan stainless model. But I did chop a 6in diameter tree down with it. Nuff said!"
3,it doesn't come with directions,I am not sure which way I am suppose to hold this thing when in a combat position. Directions with diagrams would be really helpful. I also think it should come with a red bandana so when I play Rambo in my back yard I look the part. The plastic sheeth is bulky and annoying.
3,OK as light use camp knife,"Pros.It came very sharp,handle has rubbery textured grip,decent blade,sheath is kydex or like.Cons.Blade wiggles a bit,tip could fail during hard use (this is not the high carbon model),sheath will not securely hold the knife at all,unless you use the snap closesure also its molded to the knife so only one way in.No pommel for hammering.I bought this as an cheap alternative to a Fallkniven knife,as just a general camp knife,I hardly use anymore because of the sheath (its Dangerous without the snap). You get what you pay for."
4,Cold Steel SRK,"The Cold Steel SRK is a very good knife, good handle, good thick blade. The only reason i dont give it 5 stars is due to the fact that it is stainless steel instead of carbon steel and were the sheath holds the knife there is slight wear and tear after a short time.a good knife for camping or survival trips."
2,Good Knife....... Crappy Sheath,"I do like the knife but the sheath with mine is horrible. Turn the sheath upside down and the knife falls out. Don't even need to shake it, just turn it over. I suppose you could go through the trouble of using a heat gun and trying to reshape the sheath opening.... Then again, when you buy a new knife/sheath combo you kinda expect it to work. Back it goes. Hopefully your setup might be fine. I am a Cold Steel fan."
2,No Competition,"It does the job but is ugly, awkward, and unpleasant to use. If there was any other software like it I would drop Labora in a heartbeat. The program was probably state of the art 5-6 years ago, but is woefully outdated. It is overpriced and the only updates that get made are minor.Someone please make something better!"
1,disapointed,i cant rate this cd as much as i would love to as i cant buy it in the uk other than on the web going to las vegas soon though so i hope to buy it there
1,Not again,"In 1978 one of the worst albums ever made, Meat Loaf's ""Bat Out Of Hell"" was released. It was a huge hit, and then, mercifully, his career went in the toilet.Then, fourteen years later in 1992, the ever dreaded sequel - cleverly titled ""Bat Out of Hell II,"" was released. It was just as bad, and almost as popular. Then, mercifully, Meat Loaf's career headed back into the toilet.Now he is another attempt to revive a sagging career. The songs are still bad, just perhaps not quite as overproduced. Ignore this people and maybe he will finally go away once and for all."
1,Snooze,"What a snooze. Has been performer trying desperatley to cash in on past glories. We've seen (and heard) it before, why should we pay attention now?"
3,Doesn't Translate Well To CD,"Storytellers is the type of show that is cool to experience live or see on TV. However, it TRANSLATES HORRIBLY TO CD. It wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't Meat Loaf. His songs especially don't fit this format. Jim Steinman's (what a shame he wasn't there for this show) epic compositions can't be cut down to absurdly short lengths like they are here, it just isn't right. However, the song that are fully intact (Bat, Heaven Can Wait, etc. and the new track Is Nothing Sacred?) are all killer. A hardcore fan of Meat Loaf will get this cd for those songs and for the hilarous (during the first listen anyway) stories that precede the songs. But if you're not a big Meat Loaf fan then you should spring for the Live Around The World album."
2,"NOT BAD,NOT GREAT EITHER.",I'M A BIG MEAT FAN AND HIS VOICE IS NOT GREAT ON THIS ALBUM.IT SOUNDS LIKE HE PLUGS HIS NOSE WHEN HE SINGS.AND THE SONGS THEMSELVES BY THE MUSICIANS ARE NOT GREAT EITHER.BUT YOU DO LEARN ALOT ABOUT THE SONGS BETWEEN EACH ONE.
1,Unlistenable,I work in a music store and the manager had this on our list of CDs we play in store. He ended up removing it from that list because our customers were expressing such a negative reaction to it. I must admit that this is easy to understand why.
2,Must Try Harder,"Maybe if old Meat would record some decent new songs then he would chart higher than #147 on the Billboard top 200, sad, real sad."
1,More of the same,"The thing I have never cared for about Meat Loaf's music is that it has always been just way too overblown for me. I suppose if one is into histrionics and theatrics one might enjoy him, but for me, well I'm sorry, I really just don't get it."
1,Failure to launch due to misinformation,"In the beginning, the First Person was alright, and even granting that some speculation had to be done, but to have Him considering marriage and not knowing of His divinity up until that point was totally biblically incorrect. I stopped reading at that point and wish I did not still have the book showing in my Kindle."
1,Very Disappointing,"I must say I had great expectations for this book based on the other customer reviews on Amazon.com. The most disappointing part of this book for me was the part where Jesus says he drank from a sponge that was drugged, indicating to me that he did not really die. I was hoping that at least this book would stick to the somewhat limited historical facts that we have about Jesus. To have Jesus say he did not die but was only sleeping, even if only in a fiction book, is to me intolerable."
1,Frighteningly misleading and false,"This is the most ridiculous book ever written. It sucks you in, and you expect to read a believable fictional biography of the Christ. Instead, it's a story that, if it referred to Mohammed, or Buddha, or any other religious figure, it would not even have been printed.Sacrilegious in the utmost, and not a book for anyone who is considering belief, or already does believe, Jesus Christ to be the Son of God.Disappointing. Does not even deserve one star. One of the few books I have ever thought needed to be burned."
2,Is Neil just having fun with us?,"The Christianity I thought I knew as a young man is not what it is now. The south really HAS risen again with the far right intolerant ""you are not a Christian"" if you don't agree with them... etc. caused me to take a very hard look at all of it. but that has nothing to do with my opinion of this book/ I suppose if I were an atheist I might be amused by this book. But, it must have been fun for nNeil I am not, NOT interested in anything they have to say about anything. If one looks at the history of how the books of the bible were put together... they don't want to do that. They always answer that God works in mysterious ways, etc.. But yet we were ""fashioned in His image"" ?... The dichotomy is everywhere. But Elliott's book when viewed as entertainment is OK. Even I fine it incredulous though. So, paraphrasing Spot'n Life in ""Porgy and Bess"" I takes it with a grain of salt cause it ain't necessarily so."
4,Just started reading,"So far, so good. I have only read a couple of chapters so I can't really give a very accurate rating yet."
1,Disappointing,"I had expected much more from an author so sure of his own abilities, and after reading other reviews. I am afraid I must agree with an earlier review ... Mr. Elliott seems only intent on making a fast buck."
3,Not to my taste,"I am going to catch a lot of flak for this, I know, but Pickapeppa is not to my taste. It is sweet and full, but I also think it's muddled. I prefer vinegar based hot sauces that aren't exactly ""simple"" in flavor but have a little more clarity (and less sugar) than what this offers. Pickapeppa is probably at its best splashed as an ingredient in a sauce, but when I want something to put on a cooked dish I go with something else."
2,Falls short on many fronts,"About the only thing this media player was good for was connecting to Internet radio. It failed at streaming more than one song in a row from my PC. It also doesn't have WPA security for the 802.11b so you're best to hard wire it.Since I don't think you can buy it anymore, I'm not sure what good this review is, but if you're thinking of getting a used one from somebody, I'd recommend you steer clear of the MP101. There are other alternatives that I'm told work much better.Oh yeah, I spent about 3 hours on the phone with Netgear tech support (sure sounded to me like everyone I spoke with was in India) and they were unable to solve the problem."
1,Did not work and had to return,"I had major problems wih this unit. It did not work at all and after calling Netgears tech support and being on hold for 45 minutes I had an almost useless tech tell me to update the firmware. I updated the firmware and it played a bit but was very, very choppy and had lots of interference even if it was hardwired.The tech support was useless so i returned it."
1,Returned this for a Squeezebox,"I'm a bit of an audiophile and I was disappointed in the MP101, it lacks digital outputs and doesn't support any lossless compression formats (I've got tracks in FLAC, WAV, AIFF and now Apple's new Lossless format). The software is a joke and the product was really hard to set up. Plus, the LCD display was hard to read at a distance.While the MP101 is a bit cheaper, it's a poor imitation of the product that I ended up with, which was Squeezebox. It's got both optical and coax digital outputs, supports tons of audio formats including uncompressed, automatically imports from iTunes (so my playlists on my iPod are the same on my stereo)."
1,Great Idea - Poor Software,"Great Idea, Wireless network set up OK, loaded software and scanned for MP3 files. Everything working fine, couldn't be happier.Then I started loading more of my CD's and LP's into MP3 format for use with the system. Problems, each time I added more music the software ""broke"" and the browse music function stopped working. Each time I tried to select by Artist I could only get half way through the ""B""s before the list would loop back. Any attempt to search by starting letter would produce a ""Search Failed"" message.Deleting the music and loading from scratch did not solve the problem. Neither did restarting either the computer or the MP101So far the only thing that has worked is un-installing and then re-installing the software, complete with rescanning for music. Not a viable options for each time I add more music.As for customer support ? I'm still waiting for a response."
3,"When it works, its great. But when it doesnt....","The MP101 is a great unit if you can get up and running. It took me quite some time to do so. The server software that ships with the unit is useless if you have over 300 songs. Download the Twonkyvision server software instead. It will coast you 20 bucks, but it is worth every penny.And make use of the Yahoogroups MP101 page. Tech support from Netgear is almost non existant. You get what you pay for. If your willing to jump through some hoops, you will love it. If you are a techno-phobe, you might want to try another product."
1,Buyer beware,"This product is a bleeding edge technological failure. I have other Netgear products and they work fine, but this was a dud.I upgraded it to the latest firmware/software (as of Nov '04), shutdown my firewall and still even with a wired connection to this product, it could not play any of my mp3s for longer than 40 seconds if that. The player would stop mid song and jump to the next and then try to play the previous. My PC has no trouble playing these songs."
3,Good component for digital media system,but wireless setup is kind of primitive and could be improved. Otherwise streams good..
3,"Could be better, but it does what Netgear offers","Since mid 2004 I`ve been waiting for the second generation of devices like the Netgear Wireless player. Tired to wait, and after re-reading the customer reviews of this and similar devices, I decided to buy Netgear`s one.In brief, it does what the manufacturer advertises. No more and sometimes less.Some hints, already covered by other reviewers:- First and even before you open the box, go to Netgears web site and download the last version of the server and player software.- Install the last version of the server software and upgrade the player`s firmware.- After this, throw away Netgears server software and install TwonkyVision Music ServerAfter all of this, enjoy your music, but be prepared to go through sporadic long reboot cycles. Perhaps the reboot cycles could be avoided with a wire connection instead of using wireless."
1,It NEVER works....rip off,"Basically, its a piece of crap. The server never connects. When it does connect, the songs break up and don't sound right. The Media Server software always locks up. Its just an awful program. What a waste of $ this was.How could Netgear release something that was so horrid? Beats me."
3,Does not work with Rhapsody or AOL Radio,"If you look on the box it says that it works with AOL Radio and Rhapsody. I was using both, so I purchased it.Since the time it was manufactured those players have changed versions and no longer work with the MP101.You might be able to get Rhapsody to play a song or 2, but that is all I could get no matter what software or firmware I installed. AOL radio has a new version of DRM that does not work with the MP101 period.Using the media server from Netgear that was made for the MP115 I was able to get internet streaming radio and mp3s to work perfect. Booting it up with the wireless is a little slow so I left it on most of the time.After a while I gave up on it and ran a 50' extension cord under my house from my PC to my stereo instead.In my old house I had a cheap gateway profile all-in-one PC that I used for my media. That worked much better and you can get one on ebay for under $100 sometimes."
2,Long Way To Go,"The product is immature; I am likely returning it after just a few days. The unit often stops working. You must unplug the power from the back to get it out if its funk. I tried using it with Rhapsody Radio so to have internet radio over my stereo, unfortunately it plays two songs then proceeds to state ""Unable to Play Song"" followed by ""Skipping Song"" indefinitely until I unplug the power. Netgear's technical support is very weak. I presume they will either eventually fix the product or drop it from its product line. I don't want to risk it, so I will return it and likely purchase a similar device from another manufacturer."
3,OK Product - Could be better,"This product is OK. The setup was easy, the software on the PC is simple to use, and the menu on the box is simple to use. IF you get quality speakers, the sound will be fine.The only problem I have found is that I over 500 artists in my collection. I get a ""Search Failed"" most of the time. I am up to date on the firmware and software on the PC."
2,Netgear MP101,"Linksys Wireless G Router...$90Norton Internet Security...$40Piece of mind knowning you can browse the web in a secure environment...priceless; however, throw in a Netgear MP101 and your piece of mind goes right out the window. I can't believe netgear is still in business if all of the products they sell are this horendous to setup and maitain. It took literally 4 hours to get this machine online where it would at least recognize the wonderful software that Netgear developed to operate this unit. Once it was online, it worked fine until I decided I wanted to listen to a different song...then it shutdown and would not reconnect to the server. The best part about this product was the box it came in...which should make it very easy to return this product. I also had the bright idea to call Netgear techincal support and I must say that was an experience that no one human being should have to go through. Lab rats are smarter than these guys."
2,"Works, but .... !","This player works, and probably offers value for money, but this player, and I think the whole field of music players still has to mature. I will start with the problems:- Don't use supplied software. Get something like TwonkyVision Musicserver (free). This will read your Itunes database as well.- GUI is bad. Browsing through artists/genres is very slow.- Searching is appalling. If you search for ""stones"" it will not find ""the rolling stones"" because this artist does not start with the string ""stones"". If you don't know the exact spelling of your artist you can't find it.- Wireless connection does not always work, use wired instead.What works OK is just listening to a list of songs in one genre (so you don't have to search for other songs because that is too slow), or listening to internet radio, which is possible through Twonky.Regards,Simon"
4,Great product - just don't use their software,"I am using this on my wireless 802.11g network. Setup was a little tricky because there are about 6 wireless networks visible in my apartment, but I figured it out in a hour or so. When using the included NETGEAR server software, the music was choppy and would speed up at times. I was just about to send the product back when I downloaded the free TwonkyVision software. Just copy the single executable file to your My Music folder, run it, and you are all set. No more skipping at all. Don't use the NETGEAR software again, except to upgrade the firmware. Once it's working - this product is great, especially for the price (after rebate)."
3,Defective unit - no replacement,"The unit arrived and did not work properly (it works for 1 minute on a song and then ""stutters"" constantly). Netgear support helped me to diagnose this, and after a few weeks, determined it was defective. The Netgear support is very responsive and did try (and it was escalated), but I think they do not know much about this product. I have always had good experience with Netgear until now.Amazon did not have a replacement. So, I have bought the Sound Blaster version. I have an Audiotron, which is great, but you cannot get them anymore."
3,Latest firmware kills Rhapsody,"I bought this unit as a device to listen to Rhapsody streaming radio on my home stereo. It was all dandy, until the latest firmware. Now it has become useless for Rhapsody, but somehow it works very well with Radio@AOL. Hmmm. Tech support for Netgear will not acknowledge a problem, have no suggestions, or just won't respond. Netgear is still advertising Rhapsody support. That's mis-representation, and that's a crime. Don't buy if you want Rhapsody support, it isn't there anymore."
1,Don't waste money,"1. If you are looking to stream online radio, it's limited to two subscription services. Why pay more for less quality when you can get wireless speakers and stream what YOU want, not what THEY want you to buy?!?! It's also CHEAPER to get wireless speakers and you can do much more.2. VERY poor support with people who speak broken English at best and do not understand simple questions as they don't understand our language. (A stupid and unethical corporate trend these days -- I shouldn't have to learn 40 languages to survive product support in my nation).3. Drops and doesn't play all audio or plays it incorrectly. Very limited.4. Maybe someday, it will just stream to other devices what is on your pc. But right now, extremely limited. I can burn mp3s and play it on a stereo for cheaper too. This thing is nonsense the way it is. Now, if it played any service I already have and radio stations I listen to for free, (and it worked), I would say they aren't charging enough."
2,Make sure the plug is handy,"This is a great idea, with an awful implementation. I got it up and running in 10 mins, updated all the firmware and software, configured my firewall, etc. It plays rhapsody, internet radio, and your mp3 library for short periods of time (5 to 10 mins). It regularly loses the wireless signal, or the server, or both, and I tried it with two different APs including one that has much better RF performance. When it gets confused, it gets really confused and there is no way to get it back other than pulling the plug, so make sure its handy and make sure you took your pills, because this great little idea is really badly implemented.Looks like a hacked software implementation or some kind of marginality in the hardware. Unusual for Netgear, their stuff is usually pretty good."
4,Jump Inc Push Push One Day Too Far,When released in 1986 this album was very under-rated. Great extended mixes for Sex and Fame and Midnite Action. For any rock/pop music tragic this album is worth purchasing.
4,ok book.,"i have not used this book so much ever since i bought it but from wat i've seen, its mostly about architectural spaces... meaning space inside a structure, it also shows amazing sections, like the ones on the cover.... if you want to learn more about interior spaces this book is great..."
4,"again,,,,,,",i must say ching is one the best. this a next book i like from which he authored. a must for architects!!!
4,Interesting,I picked it up as a first architecture book. Its not. Its more or less hundreds of pages of drawings with themes on each page to make you think about that form. Good for understanding basic forms.
4,Excellent primer,"Those who have panned this book weren't looking for insight into the thought process of architectural design. This book is not a cookbook, but a primarily graphical introductory intended to start the architecture student thinking how architects think.I'm not technically an architecture student, but rather an architecture design ""hobbyist"". I found this book very useful as far as helping me to look at the design process in new ways, and to better understand the various historical (and contemporary) methods/techniques used to formulate architectural designs.This book is a textbook, not a 5 lb. coffee table glossy."
4,Audrey Hawthorne's Kwakiutl Art,"This is a very good, comprehensive book of Kwakiutl carving. I have been painting and carving northwest style art for 20 years and is a tremendous resource both for ideas and understanding the art style."
5,Her Finest Live Album If You Want To Rock.,"If I could buy just one Melissa Ferrick album (the thought terrifies me as I need them ALL) this would be the one. Ferocious guitar playing, terrific vocals. It's so hard to believe three instruments are producing all of this fabulous sound - those being Melissa's guitar, Brians' drums and the most important instrument of all her voice. Buy this CD - you will not be disappointed. She shreads - just shreads on so many cuts, her marvelous, on the spot improvisation. Few artists, many with grammy's all over their mantle are able to go up to a microphone with a guitar and perform like Ferrick can. She rocks!"
2,Overpriced and not that great...,The product just isnt that great. Same cleanser as any other I have bought at the local grocery store. I have however had luck with the Cetaphil products and highly recommend them for sensitive skin. Dont waste your money on this one!
4,Happy Purchase,I was pleased with this title. It has been very informative and helpful in my hobbie. The author is very knowlegable in the field of diorama making.
5,"OK, I am biased...","I have known Rick for some time, and admired his many abilities for years. His gift for ushering people into the presence of God is undeniable. He has probably written more songs sung in churches every Sunday, than any other songwriter. (Many people would be stunned to hear all the recognizable songs he has written)""You've Pulled Away the Curtain"" and the rest of this CD continue to demonstrate his gift. Give it a listen and you will suddenly find yourself taken beyond the cares of this world, and into His presence."
2,Not very pleasant flavor.,"As with most people who select flavored water, I choose it when I don't want sugary drinks or artificial sweetners, but want something a little more than plain water.I found this flavor to be weak, which is expected with flavored water, but also found it to be unpleasant.To me this tasted like when you're eating an orange, and you get a bit of orange rind. It very much had that orange oil, bitter taste.I won't be buying this flavor again."
5,Best water EVER,"first bought Hint water from our local health food store. I loved the taste of all of the flavors they had in stock, but didn't care for the price they charging.I saw that Amazon carried them for considerably less cost and had many more flavors in stock.These waters are the most refreshing bottled water I have ever had. I rarely drink anything other than water, and usually not bottled water since we have a filtering system, and I feel guilty using plastic bottles for one drink.But, for people who do not care for water (which I can't imagine) this brand is great. They are not sweet, have no artificial garbage in them, and will fulfill your water quota for the day. I just can't say enough good things about this brand."
2,Was Not Impressed,"I seldom if ever give a negative review, but to put it bluntly, this stuff was bad. I tried this product based on its label of ""Premium Essence Water"", and the flavor sounded good too (Pomegranate-Tangerine). The first thing I noticed before opening the bottle was the amount of debris/particles/sediment floating inside the water while the sun was reflected into the bottle. I decided to still go ahead and try it and was quite unimpressed. The water had a flavor of industrial tap water, the kind you get in a large city, that is processed at the water plant nestled next to the sewer plant. There was a 'hint' of some flavor, though I couldn't pinpoint it. I gave the high 2-star rating because it would probably still be effective at dousing a fire."
5,Hint water,"This is the best flavored water I've ever tried, plus there are no calories, sugar, carbs, artificial sweeteners or sodium."
4,great investment,"Quick Spanish for Law Enforcement was one of the best books I have ever bought. I recomend it for any law enforcement professional who is looking for some basic skills in the spanish language. Not only is the book a good tool to carry in the squad car, but it would also be a good investment for a department to keep a few copies just in case. The book even has start to finish investigation questions for crime scenses such as burglary, assault, rape etc. However, I had to give the book only 4 stars, because I needed a chapter devoted to the booking process for a correctional setting, but I still will continue to use the book as a basic reference. Order your copy today!!!"
1,Horrible,"The animations of this dvd-Daniel are horrible. They people looked like modern art drawings and are very ugly but that is not the worst part. There are scenes on it not appropriate for small children, for example, there is a part that shows some decapitated heads hanging on poles. While we know things like that happened in the Bible, we don't need to dwell so much on the negative and be so graphic when telling these stories to young children. We tossed the dvd as it was not worth seeing again."
1,DO NOT ORDER,"IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO RECEIVE THIS PRODUCT FROM THIS COMPANY PLEASE DO NOT ORDER FROM THEM. THEY WILL SEND YOU #9 GRADE RAZOR BLADE FROM A DIFFERENT COMPANY.THEY ARE AN INFERIOR PRODUCT THAN THE ONE STATED IN THE AD.THEY DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAILS. I HAVE SENT THEM 2I ALSO FILLED A CLAIM, WHICH I HAVE NOT HEARD A RESPONSE FROM YET.BEWARE!!!!!!"
2,Thumbs Down Lamb Chop,"As Rod Rooter (I think that's his characters name) in the ""We're All DEVO"" laserdisc I still have (but no working player, sigh), ""Thumbs Down Lamb Chop"". OK I only just put this in and quickly played it but it's clear that there are but two songs maybe that rock a little. The Cover says ""16 digital cartoons from the de-evolution band"" well you can definitely see that this stuff could be used in a Rugrats cartoon. It's slow, it's boring, it sucks. This comes from a guy who has listened to DEVO since 79 and saw them in 80, and even loves the cd ""Shout"", this cd blows bright bile colored puke. Get it to finish off the catalog and let it collect dust. Maybe play it when you are puking bile to sooth your swelling itching brain, that's about it. Or just go totally freakazoid and get that Music Mutato disc that's like 100.00 used."
1,"Even for big DEVO fans, could it get any worse? Simply awful","I own all of DEVO's CDs, and as a longtime avid fan, I really, really tried to find something, ANYTHING, worth listening on this album, but, alas, I can't...seriously, DEVO lost the plot on this ill-fated, ill-conceived, tossed-off ""comeback"" CD - there isn't ONE good track to salvage this CD. Do yourself a favor: toss this in the bins, and go back and re-discover DUTY NOW, ARE WE NOT MEN, FREEDOM OF CHOICE, anything but this!"
1,Makes me so sad....,"I love the ""hardcore"" Devo recordings and the first three official Devo albums. If you listen to the early stuff this record will make you cry."
1,oh boy this alblum is devo at their worst,"Devo is great but as far as recordings go this is about as fun as watching paint dry. well maybe not that bad, they really seemed to have gone to pop and less rock. this recording is really chessy and deserves its place in my pile of devo stuff the bottom. no wonder alan left the band, i would have to."
4,A different sound and some VERY catchy hooks,"Buy this CD for the extended version of ""Disco Dancer."" Pop it into your car's CD and go driving somewhere at night. Anywhere, it doesn't matter. Just play it LOUD. Tracks 8-12--yeah, do those next. Think seriously about changing your license plate to read ""AGIT8ED."" There is something wearily triumphant about this CD--sort of like the feeling you get when some dolt slowly gets the joke you just told, and it's on him. :-)"
4,Good Album but not Nubians' Best,"This album is worth your loot, but if you dont have Foundation yet spend it there. BNubian lay down some tight tracks on this one including the Nubian jam and Claimin Im a Criminal...however, some of the songs in between dont hold up to this groups high standards."
5,Beautiful!,"I just received the new ""Human"" album in the mail, and it's fantastic. Falling You puts into music and lyrically beautiful words the hard to describe atmospheric and mysterious places that exist in the mind and spirit."
5,Lovely,Cheaper than dealer. No need to leave these unfixed. Change yours today. Very happy with strongarm so far good price
3,A HISTORIC DOCUMENT,"I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO ATTEND MANY VERRETT PERFORMANCES DURING HER VOCAL PRIME, INCLUDING ""LES TROYENS"" AT THE MET, WHICH SHE NEVER RECORDED, AND HER INCANDESCENT ""FAVORITA"" UNDER EVE QUELER. AMONG MY PREFFERED RECORDINGS: HER ""DON CARLO"" WITH DOMINGO AND CABALLE, THE BEST ON RECORD, AND ""L'AFRICAINE."" IN THIS RECORDING, HER STRENGTHS SHOW CLEARLY IN THE VERDI SELECTIONS. UNFORTUNATELY, LIKE GRACE BUMBRY, SHE DARED TACKLE ""NORMA,"" AND THE RESULTS ARE NOT PRETTY. NO MATTER: GET THE CABALLE/VERRETT ""MARIA ESTUARDA"", RECORDED LIVE, TO GET BACK ON TRACK."
5,Del-Lords - Based On A True Story CD,The CD arrived in a timely manner and was exactly as advertised. I will shop with this vendor again.
4,This song is soooo cool!,"Okay, so it's not ALL Will Smith, but it's good enough! This song gets stuck in your head and you sing it over and over until you like it - or get really, really sick of it."
1,product not doing what it is supposed to do,"I bought both the interior and exterior bottles of this product. I used it as per manufacturers instructions on a cool dry day . It took over a week for the rear cover on my truck to stop being sticky and picking up dust. I cleaned the rear cover again and tried this product again because I thought that I made a mistake, well the same thing happened. I did the interior with the interior spray, and the same thing happened. I emailed the address on the bottles and the answer I got was that sometimes it takes twenty- four hours to dry non sticky, I am very sorry that I purchased this product, But I am still looking for a non silicone spray or liquid for interior and exterior use."
3,"Thought provoking, if frustrating at times","The premise of this book is that men are like waffles- they think in boxes, that is, they can only efficiently think about one subject or category at a time; and that women are like spaghetti- they think about everything in an interconnected manner.Before I say anything else, reader be warned that this review is based on my own tastes and preferences, and is not necessarily unbiased.I hate generalizations and this book is full of them, from the title to the marriage jokes. The extent of generalizations made me actually physically angry at several points.However, I do like new ways of looking at problems and this book has that, if presented in a limited manner. If you can get beyond the assumption that all men are waffle-thinkers and all women spaghetti-thinkers, I believe this book can lead to a thought provoking discussion on how different styles of thinking can interrupt communication, especially between marriage partners."
5,Men are like Waffles - Women are Like Spaghetti,"This is a humorous book dealing with serious issues for newly married as well as others! The authors were married 15+ years when they wrote the book. I heard them on talk radio, bought and read the book; sent it to my about to be married sister; she and the groom to be were delighted; bought it for couple married 2 years; they are enjoying it; bought it for another bride & groom; they're finding it humorous and helpful. I am about to buy two more as gifts (I'm a widow, but it helped me understand my work environment better)An easy and enjoyable read; well worth the price!"
5,Word Pictures clearly define character of men and women,This book will refresh you.I was encouraged often times with laughter to look at the God given differences between men and women. An excellent reminder that God has a purpose for our individual uniqueness as male and female.This is a book to read more than once and keep in your library for reference as well as encouragementDoreen Hanna
4,fun read,"A very fun read and fairly insightful. Yes, men and women are different. If you've wondered how, or in what ways, this book can provide some clues. Men are often single-focused, while women tend to bounce from topic to topic in their thinking and speaking. For women, it helps to 'get in the box' with your man in order to connect on his wavelength. It explains a lot in daily marital living. The anecdotes are entertaining. I did find that all marriages not being similar may or may not relate to all of the examples within the book. That in no way detracts from the information gleaned nor the useability of understanding the opposite sex in everyday life."
3,so so,"We used this book for our small group couple's discussion.It started off good, as the main idea is great. It was very usefull to understand this idea. Both men and women agreed that the idea is accurate. It was beneficial for the spouses to understand more of their spouse. My wife never understood that sometimes I am in a ""not thinking about anything box"", but now she understands it.Though, the book streched out what really could have been compressed into a much shorter article and one time discussion vs a several week discussion.You and your spouse should read the book, talke about it, then pass it along to another couple you know."
5,Buy it!,"I give this book to all couples as a wedding gift. It gave us language for how to explain our thoughts to one another. When I get my thoughts all tangled up, I can add some humor to a situation and say, ""My noodles are in a knot."" When my husband is deep in thought, I ask him, ""What box are you in?"" I don't want to know details, usually, just the subject. It gave us a little insight into our differences and way to be merciful toward one another's differences."
1,Lacks research,"This book should have been named 'Bill and Pam Farrel's guide to marriage', because that is what it essentially is - just Bill and Pam sharing what they do in their marriages, and giving themselves lots of pats on the back.The tips and techniques they offer lack research, there is insufficient representation of what other couples think and do, and the advice given is sometimes overly naive in today's culture where couples are exposed to sexual encounters and relationship issues way before marriage.For women looking for more practical advice supported by good research, I recommend For Women Only by Shaunti Feldhahn."
2,Relations between men and women.,Pretty much just one couples opinion on relationship. Some parts made sense others were just so so.
1,It's just not working for me,"We tried getting into this book as a small group through our church and right off the bat we seemed to come to a consensus that it just isn't of much value. The stereotypes that it throws out are just that, stereotypes. It goes through common stereotypes in an ""Isn't it funny? Yeah, so you need to act like you love your spouse"" sort of manner.I believe one of the other reviewers mentioned that it kind of paints men in a bad light, and I feel the same way. In their mind, men sit around the house and drink a beer while their wife cleans. They aren't interested or concerned about what their spouse thinks. They just think about food, cars, or sports. Bah! I could go on. I just strongly recommend against this book."
4,Smart and Funny,"For any Christian couple that is looking for help with their realationship and understanding their mate this is a must have. I found this book funny and insightful and very helpful. The only way it could have been better is funny list of things from woman's perspective. If you read it you'll understand, ladies."
5,One of the Best in the Series,"I loved this book. It was one of the best I ever read!!!!!!!! This girl named kylie hates this guy named Ryan. He beats her in the president election becasue he made all these promises he couldn't keep. THen finally when Kylie gets away from school and goes on her Adventure Trails trip, she finds out that Ryan is there. But after she spends a little time with him she doesn't think he is annoying anymore. She even think she likes him. But will Ryan feel the same for her or will he go out with her best friend Stephanie. whose to know?"
4,Good value for replacing failing sensors,"These work very well, but do not seem to last quite as long as models produced several years ago. Still, compared to replacement costs charged by alarm our company these are a bargain and easy to change out."
5,works as promised,"in a 20 x 35 foot space, it detects human motion but doesn't complain about a 10 pound cat. Trivial to install, assuming that the wiring to your alarm panel is already in place."
5,Dando's most creative work,"Griffith Sunset is mesmerizing, bizarre, transfixing - Dando at his most creative, with none of his pop sensibility. The songs he's selected here are quiet, self-conscious gems, from longing alt country riffs to quasi-antique ballads. Beyond some well-planted distortion and the occasional echo of a scratching turntable, this is just Dando and his guitar. Music made for a journey - be it on foot, in a car or just in your head."
5,Evan is back in our lives again.,"After the 1996 release of ""Car Button Cloth,"" Evan Dando began to drift further and futher out of sight until by the year 2000, he had dropped of the face of the Earth altogether. This left many of his hard core fans wondering whatever happened to him, and more importantly, if we would ever see or hear from him ever again. This live album shows that Evan Dando is back, and alive and well. The album contains plenty of Lemonheads' classics, some well chosen covers, and some new Dando compositions that are excellent, and make one look foward in anticipation for his new solo album which (hopefully) be coming out soon. The compositions are all played acoustic, which give the performances a much warmer intimate feel, plus it reveals new facets of the songs that one might might miss during a electric performance. After a long period of obscurity, Evan Dando is back in our lives again, and we all should be thankful."
4,If Only...,"All I can say is I wish the acoustic set was longer... I saw him at Joe's Pub in Manhattan a year or two ago and he played acoustically for 2 hours, and it was awesome!! Dando's great!"
2,Disappointing - to say the least,"I picked this CD up as soon as I saw it was available. I'm very fond of Dando, especially his acoustic stuff. To be kind, this CD is just not all that great. I've heard better tunes off some of the music swapping sites. I've listened to the CD once and have put it away for the duration. I would much rather enjoy my own compilation of his acoustic sets and radio appearances. I sincerely suggest you put your money to better use."
1,Surprisingly vitriolic,"I was going to buy this book and the CD that goes with it. However, while viewing some of the pages online, I realized that every page Amazon let me view had some sort of criticism about the United States. There is no way I'm buying this author's products and rewarding his verbal attacks on my country. It so happens there are over a thousand forms of Qigong. I'm sure all of us who love the U.S. can manage without this one."
4,Thought provoking,"This is a book which provides a good mix of information on Tai Chi and the culture which practices it. It is not a ""quick read"" and won't make you a Tai Chi master overnight. As a student of Tai Chi and a person aware of the importance of mind/body congruence I have found it a valuable addition to my library and one which causes me to consider ause and effect of my actions on my health and well being. Not for all but definitely worth having for those who are interested in the subject."
5,Shamanic Tiger Qigong,This set is a great example of the future of Internal Martial Arts. It is spiritual and advanced. I suggest buying the DVD and using both resources for personal home training. Please have a qualified instructor guide your progress and direct your movement.
2,Techniques Sample Platter,"I had expected the book to cover foundational concepts and cover information about tools that is specific to issues that arise in game development. The book covers some of that superficially, but more in an advisory tone, rather than a hands-on code specific way.It's more of an overview of general techniques than an in-depth coverage of the topic of building tools that drive content or support games. Not directly useful to me, it turns out, but perhaps for others..."
5,Excellent Resource for Tools & .NET 2.0 Topics,"This book uses the industry standard 'gem' (multi-article) layout. The articles are some of the best I have read on the subjects that they cover. The author was very thorough in his explanation of the techniques he presents and his writing style is very simple to follow and keeps you entertained.This is by far the best tools book I have ever seen for the game industry. I would recommend this book for just about anyone: hobbyists, people just trying to break into the industry, and industry veterans. You're practically guaranteed to find several of the articles helpful. Excellent reference. Will be right next to my desk for years to come. I'm even going to buy an extra copy for the office.Anthony Whitaker - Chief Technical Officer - Boanerges Studios, LLC."
4,:D,"I bought this book b/c i went home and i was bored. I usually look up books on amazon b4 i buy or check them out from the library, but i was bored and stuck no where near a computer!First of all, i loved it! I really really want a sequal??? So if anyone knows of one in the making, let me know?Second, it does start off slow, but i promise you it gets Amazingly good the moment Syanthe meets Jerel! So... yeah READ IT! :)Third, again, it surprised me how good the story was and how much i fell in love with the characters even tho it is a short book!"
5,Love it!,"I loved this book!!! I couldn't stop reading it till I was done! I really wish the author would make a series out of this, that is what I was looking for because she left the ending in the perfect place to keep it going. Get this book, it is very good."
4,"Good book, part of a great series!","This is great for kids who are struggling readers, especially boys. The series is great. The story makes you want to keep reading.You'll find riddles that are fun to share with your family and may make you want to look up more riddles! The story gives an opportunity to talk about what to do when you are feeling hurt or lonely or scared because these are the situations that Brian the boy in the story, finds himself in.Get the whole series!"
1,Amazon mistake,"According to Amazon, this sparking plugs fitted my Jeep Liberty 6cil 3.7L engine....however they don't!!! These are for the Jeep Liberty using the 2.4L (4cil) engine.Autolite are excellent products but the reason I gave just one star is because such mistake of Amazon and not the product perse. Very expensive in my case returning them to Amazon because it was an internationa order."
4,"Nice calculator, does its job","The calculator does what it's supposed to. It's not super fancy and does not have exciting graphics. But once you play around with it for a while, the interface is somewhat intuitive. It also returns results fairly quickly."
5,Good Calculator,The calculator works great. The buttons sometimes need to be pushed hard. But other than that it seems to do the job.
5,"Village Olah Singing, The Real Thing","I hope they will ""unlimit"" this availability. This is one of my very favorite Olah albums. Ando Drom, Kalyi Jag, Romanyi Rota, Amaro Suno and Romano Drom are all great, but they mostly represent the Urban approach to Olah singing. This album by Kek Lang is what you hear in the countryside. This is closer to what I've actually heard in my travels in Eastern Europe (unless you go to a concert). All of the tracks are traditional - except one! That one is a surprise! ...Highly recommended!"
5,It reminded me of how our family USED to keep entertained,I bought this CD for my parents in Philadelphia. It had the sounds we heard as children growing up in a family of Italian entertainers. Now we all own copies of it & we live all over the country. My parents thought it was the best gift ever. We'll be buying Famous songs of Naples (american translation) next. Thanks Amazon for hooking us up!
1,"Good display box, bad product packaging and arrived damaged...twice.","This display box was exactly what I was looking for. It will do a fine job of protecting whatever you choose to putinside from dust and dirt. The bad news is, I ordered two of them and one arrived badly damaged. Amazon sent me areplacement, but that also arrived damaged. It looks like the damage occurred before the items were shipped to me,because both broken items had dents in the product packaging on a corner as if they had been dropped and there wasno obvious damage to the shipping containers. I could understand getting a bad one once, but twice? That shouldnever have happened. In my opinion, the manufacturer should do a better job of packaging these things because they are fragile. Put some styrofoam in the boxes to protect them. I would gladly give the display boxes a 5-star rating if they weren't broken, but this has been a terrible purchase experience."
4,Solid CD with some oddities,"I liked this album. I found the tape in a pawn shop for $2, liked the cover so I bought it. I was impressed. It's a little over produced, but all-in-all a good choice. Solid sound, good guitar work and some interesting lyrics. There are some stand out tracks(Most Dangerous Game stands out in my mind at the moment), and some iffy tracks. The price for this might be a little high, but if you like slightly over produced thrash metal, this is a getter.I have their 2nd CD also, not nearly as good(other than the cover of Holiday in Cambodia). This one is fun."
3,Mixed bag of metal,"This is an uneven effort by a band moving from more standard heavy metal to thrash. There are some great riffs and a few great songs on here, but the overall effort is uneven. I still enjoy it, but it isn't until their follow-up release, ""Annihilation Principle"", that they get the formula right in my opinion. (of course, they lost it after that. boo!)"
1,Laaz Suckit,"Laaz Rockit's music is some of the most talentless, time-wasting audio tripe I have ever had the misfortune of being tricked into buying. This band could not thrash their way out of an untied garbage bag. You could randomly pick 4-5 homeless people off the streets of any major city and chances are, they would form a better band and put on a better show than Laaz Rockit - even if they had no chance to practice, they had never seen the instruments before, and they did not speak the same language. Do yourself a favor and leave this musical excrement on the shelf and thank yourself for the favor. Guitar work is pitifully repetitive, drum solos weak, and the audio sounds like an abused child. The tracks drone on forever, as if cycling the song through your subconcious will somehow alleviate the painful memory of its exposure. Attempts at deep lyrics are shallow, as is the talent of this unfortunate grouping of pretenders."
3,Good but not Great for the price.,"This book needs to be printed again. It's good, but not great for the amount this book is going for by sellers."
5,I enjoyed this,This is a unique DVD. Elijah sings opera. I enjoyed this but it will be interesting to see how the kids in my Sunday School class responds to it.
5,perfect,"It was just as described, new and unused. The children loved it as an ending to our Sunday School Unit on Elijah! Some of the scenes are inaccuate, but we discussed them at the end of the movie. You can also see this on YouTube, if you want to preview the actual movie."
4,Completely accurate to the actual Bible story!,"As the owner and webmaster of BibleMovies.com I have a burning desire aswell as a great joy to watch and review Bible movies, and this little video is Hot!!! I was astonished at the incredible accuracy and nearly word-for-word recreation of the life and adventures of Elijah the Tishbite. Starting off with Elija's prophetic command to stop the rain from falling because of King Ahab's worship of Baal, then the test of the stronger God who answers with fire, and concluding with the Prophetic anointing passed to Elisha, Elija's predecessor, and many other interesting facts, this little video misses little. I was only disappointed to have it end, as is with all Bible Movies. Great for adults as well as children. Thumbs way way up on this one ,TESTAMENT!John NewmanBibleMovies.com"
1,Violence!,"Shows too much violence & blood. Did not impress dad, grandma, or grandpa. Too high level of understanding required for our just turned 6 year-old grandson. More like an adult cartoon than for kids; however, it did not even appeal to us older folks!"
4,Elijah,I received the product on time and in good shape. It therefore met my need. I was able to locate the book easily.Thanks.
4,Melt Away with a Heartthrob,"Fans of pure latin pop won;t be disappointed with Carlos Ponce's music, vocals or song selections. This is Latin pop at its best - a sterling collection of tracks that inspire the listener to dance, reflect and just - LISTEN. ""Escuchame"" is a tremendous song, where the singer begs to be heard. And ""Me Muero"" is another plea for love. In between, there are soft magical melodies and unadulterated songs of pure joy. A terrific addition to any Spanish (or english) language collection. Just listen and you'll see why."
5,His best album.,"I think that Carlos is one of the best latin singers and he's tree albums are very good (this is the second one). If you don't know about he's music, it's pop with some tropical ifluences. If you've heard from him and want to buy one of he's cd's I'd recommed this tittle.The biggest hit of this album was the #3 ""Escuchame"" (listen to me) and has other hits like ""Amiga sombra"" (Shadow, my friend) and ""Todo lo que soy"" (all I am).The career of Carlos in music has been very good. He's first album from 1998 won a Billboard award, topped the Latin Charts and had 2 #1 hits (""Rezo"" and ""Y recurdo""). In 1999 he released ""Todo lo que soy"" that was once again a hit reached #4 in the Latin Charts and had the hits that I've named.He's latest album ""Ponce"" which was released in 2002 had only one official single ""Mujer con pantalones"" (Woman with pants).Carlos has a good voice and he's rhythms are very good. I really recommed this singer."
1,"WEAK, WEAK, WEAK.",I was so disappointed in this CD. Carlos Ponce latest CD is a boring muddled mess. Miss it.
5,THE BEST!!!,This cd is great. I love all the songs in this album. Carlos Ponce is the best. It must be great to have a duet with my favorite singer Jessica Cristina is Carlos Ponce's next CD.
1,Songwriting at its best!,"Initially it bothered me that Carlos had not produced a followup to his ""Rezo"" success. Most artists are supposed to strike while the iron is hot. Then I remembered an interview of his wherein he stated that he does quality and works on single projects at a time to insure that quality. Well, I know where he spent his time. The lyrics are deep, meaningful and poetic, but with a melody. The literary talent & style in his songwriting is truly mature....an area where Ricky and Enrique don't compete. I am a mature listener of good quality music - and Carlos offers just that. I find great pleasure and pride in interpreting his lyrics to my English-speaking friends. Good stuff, it's worth buying the CD."
2,The first one had more spark!,"I loved the first CD. It had more movement, more energy. I guess he really shows on this one ""All that he is"", and the music he likes. He's a good writer, so I suppose he's a good watcher. If you really like those romaaaaaaantic-type of songs, this is your CD. Not mine, anyways. Good luck with your new audience, Carlos."
3,It's Latin Pop...whaddya expect?,"If you're going to listen to Latin Pop you have to accept it for what it is...sugary, romantic ballads with an occasional hip-swaying upbeat track thrown in. Ponce's voice is admittedly not as polished as Marc Anthony's or Ricky Martin's but nor is it as annoying as Elvis Crespo's. This is one of those albums that doesn't mean much in the long run, but while he's somewhat current it's worth a listen to on occassion. ""Escuchame"" is a catchy tune but boy is his voice weak on ""Todo lo que soy""."
2,Carlos could do soo much better,"Last time I visited Carlo's home town, Humacao, Puerto Rico there was so much hype about his upcomimg new cd. I just want to say that he has the looks, but not the voice. He could have done so much better in the selection of music, etc. for this cd. Sorry Carlos, I am not a fan anymore."
3,"Good, but let's compare...","I bought Carlos's first album, and enjoyed it enough to purchase the second one, and the same day I also bought Enrique Iglesias's newest, ""Enrique."" Played Carlos's first, enjoyed it, especially the final song, which is a sweet ballad (I believe it's for his first child). Then, I put on Enrique's album, and was blown away. Forget Ricky Martin, who's all the rage at the moment, and compare Carlos with Enrique. Both write lyrics (no music), but Enrique's album is so much more dynamic in melody and production. Enrique's voice is so much more powerful and versitile, it really made Carlos's voice sound weak in comparison. So... good album, but comparitively weak to Enrique's."
4,"Wonderful performance, a good ""first recording""","For one who does not already own this work, Pearlman is a great start. While I personally prefer the Andrew Parrott and Konrad Junghanel recordings, the Boston Baroque is certainly my favorite ""more expansive"" version. There can never be a ""correct"" recording of the Vespers as much is left to the conductors preference. Thus, no two recordings are alike, each has it's own flavor.This Pearlman set is probably the ""safest"" disc for one who wants the grand majesty of the music, yet desires the devotional quality as well. Easily and by far much, much better than Gardiner's."
5,Just won a Grammy nomination - 2nd one for this group.,"This recording of the great Vespers is almost beyond description. Everything about it is as close to perfection as I have ever heard. And Telarc's sound, as usual, is stunning. I don't thing there will be anything to rival this record for some time. It's no wonder that it just got a Grammy nomination, 2nd one for this group (Messiah being the other, also best in class)."
4,Rendell Shines As Vine!,"Ruth Rendell (aka Barbara Vine) dwells not so much on the physical aspects of the mystery genre, so much as the psychological. She's not a ""whodunnit"" author, she's a ""why wuz it dunn?""Anna's Book, although not as psychologically draining as her novel ""A Dark Adapted Eye,"" is still an excellently-crafted novel. Written from varying viewpoints of both the deceased and the related, we learn of Anna's deep secrets through her journals - ostensibly best sellers because of the frank honesty of a late 19th century Danish-born Briton. Several loose ends are left untied: namely, the real father of Anna's daughter ""Swanny."" Were Anna's parents a notorious double murder case? Was Anna's father her actual father? The journals leave no clue, and the book descends into Anna's descendents' mad scramble to find the truth. This book is extremely enjoyable, beautifully written, and (as all Rendell/Vine characters are) all too vivid."
3,NOT THAT GREAT AS A MYSTERY,"It was a good book, sometimes confusing, sometimes not all that compelling. I didn't care that much for the character Swanny, nor the narrator, Ann. The only person of interest in the story, was Anna, and her excerpts were few and far between. It just didn't compel me as some other reviews stated. Good mystery, nice to read one that wasn't a straight murder."
3,Not her best,"I see many other people have told the plot line, so suffice to say I do not think this is her best work - other books have more tension - this was not a ""page-turner"" for me. I've read all Ruth Rendell's books and recently started in on the Barbara Vine ones, and I would probably rate this lowest of all her books I've read so far. It's interesting, but I have come to expect that breathless anticipation of what is on the next page, and I didn't find it in this book."
3,Amongst the best of a bad lot,"The state of theory is in such tremendous flux at present with a majority of research unpublished and a growing consensus that the state of the art is entirely inadequate. No book could possibly please industry researchers at this point, but Philipp contributes some ideas and clarification here and there and some leads which are valuable. He is perhaps a little dismissive and pessimistic when the theory wanders into hard mathematical problems, and to to a large extent his book ends where the fun stuff begins. Nontheless I would recommend, especially to those entering the field."
4,Very Detailed,"A very useful text for those who need to understand how to implement a model. In finance, notation and concepts vary widely across different authors and it is often uncertain what the equations behind the model mean. It is helpful to be able to walk through Schonbucher's detailed explanations of assumptions and key ideas within each alternative model choice. His writing in this book is clearer than his earlier papers."
2,Models in theory,"Nice equations, but hasn't kept up with Ph.D.'s who work on Wall Street and know the theory, thoroughly understand the products, and can apply practical but theoretically sound compromises to accommodate reality. Ph.D.'s at work in finance - including myself (physics) - are probably too busy to write the definitive modelling book. This book fails to address key ingredients such as daycounts, settlement conventions, documentation asymmetry, and more."
1,Very bad presentation. I was bored to death before I finished the first 20 pages,"The author should rewrite this book. The presentation and organisation are terrible. Often you will see formulas come out without an explanation.Would definitely not recommend it.Grab any papers wrote by the market-practitioners, you will find they are much easier for you to understand the concepts of various credit derivatives models than the book could.BTW, I wrote a negative review in amazon.co.uk, but was deleted twice."
4,Red Acoustic Guitar,"This is a good looking and great sounding Acoustic guitar. I bought this for my son for Christmas and he loves it. Sounds good with or without an amp, so you can play anywhere. Great product for the price."
1,Its not an acustic guitar,"Ive just got the item and why isnt it an electric acoustic guitar???The title says it is, and theres pictures of one so i thought the ukelele pictures were just mistaken.Ive paid for what the item claims to be, im highly disappointed with it.Horrible."
4,This is not a uke!,"We got this acoustic electric guitar to spare my husband's shoulder when he plays.Acoustic is much friendlier than a flat electric for body machanics.It has helped alot but more surprisingly it turned out to be a nice guitar for the price.Easy to play, nice sound. Built-in turner.The only drawback is the volume is right on top and is easily bumped while playing."
3,Eh,"With a Uke in this price range, you get what you pay for. The electronics quit 5 months after I bought it. I called ""Oscar"", he didn't want to see a receipt, he sent me a replacement electronics, no questions asked. It was still under warranty, barely. Leads me to think this is a common problem."
2,Errors detract from material.,"As an introductory Nuclear Engineering or Nuclear Physics textbook, the book fulfills only the minimal requirements. There are none of the marks of a thoroughly constructed book, such as separate sections with supplementary information. These faults were all excusable, until the list of mistakes and typos began to develop. It is inexcusable how blatantly incorrect some of the formulas are in this text. The book needs a serious once-over for corrections."
3,quite ok,"The book has some interesting ways of presentig the topic but is not for someone with a sound background in physics (in that case you can skip more than half of the book at once). It does expend a lot on basic physics which is not bad, but dedicated to details that are not needed at all for the main subject, which is the principles for engineering in the field of nuclear reactors. Another major problem is the equations editor, very nasty, the equations look nasty with huge parenthesisis where thay are not needed making the reading a bit disgusting. In the nuclear engineering part there are some mistakes but it is not so bad. Another major problem is that for the more interesting examples, they are worked out by programs that are not easyly available, even that some are just academic level stuff, this is a major drawback of many of these books. They should consider some of the more available codes for educational purposes.As a recomendation, try to look the book before you buy it."
5,Pharmacy in History,"I remember seeing similar films, shown by coach when it was raining and there was nothing else to do in gym class. Now I'm teaching a History of Pharmacy class at a local university and find this film valuable. First, as an honest (if somewhat campy by 21st century standards) look at the profession at that point in time. Second, for the unintended humor contained in the film, especially with respect to the roles of women in the profession. Overall, it's very good for this use. Quality and audio are as good as could be expected, better than the old projector coach used in the gym."
4,"Growing with Gardening: A Twelve-month Guide for Therapy, Recreation, and Education",This book is still very relevant and helpful if you are interested in horticultural therapy.
5,Buy it NOW!,"Bebo Norman is a breath of fresh air. First of all his music is so restful. It makes you want to sit back, relax and soak in the tremendous feeling of peace that you get when someone tells you that they have the same conflicts and problems as you. Songs like the Healing Song give you great musical style and lyrical accuracy that makes Bebo Norman one of the best Folk/Spiritual artists today. Bebo's music is like a white shirt. It goes great with everything. Enjoy him, I do."
2,not good,"the nipples for these bottles are smaller for some reason, the kittens have a much harder time adjusting to them"
5,It never fails to move me,"I bought this on audio cassette tape 15 years ago. I have also seen Mr. Stewart's one-man show in LA. I have listened to this 100's of times (literally) and it never fails to move me. I could listen to Patrick Stewart read the phone directory, and probably find it enjoyable, but his performance of this classic work is nothing short of amazing. I feel like I am in the story myself and it is so entertaining. My cassettes died the other day so I am happy to see that this brilliant work is still available in some form. Thank you, Patrick, for this wonderful gift, and thank you Amazon, for carrying it. I would have been heartbroken not to be able to replace it."
3,A Christmas Carol Through My Eyes,"Being a person who enjoys books, I was excited to read this Christmas classic. I was a little disapointed to find that the vocabulary of the book was a bit above my level. The only reason I was able to follow along with what was happening was because I had seen the movie so many times and I knew the concept of the story. I think that the book definitely does a good job of showing how someones life would be with out love and care in their heart. There are so many Ebeneezer Scrooges in this world and they don't realize how much their cold heartedness and hatred impacts other people. I would deffinitely recomend this book for people that are on a high school level and above."
3,NOT AS GOOD AS THE CLASSIC I HAVE,"I HAVE A CHRISTMAS CAROL BY CHARLES DICKENS, ILLUSTRATED BY FREDERICK SIMPSON COBURN, COPY RIGHT YEAR 1900. IT IS AN OLD BOOK, AND I AM TRYING TO FIND OUT IF IT IS AN ORIGINAL. THE KNICKERBOCKER PRESS, NEW YOUR. ANY THOUGHTS?"
4,Patchy but energetic action thriller,"This low budget movie has action aplenty, a few murders, lots of swearing and some very good acting. Throw in a couple of plot twists and deadpan comedy and you get a very good way to waste an afternoon.The movie is about a couple of small time criminals and the scam that goes wrong, which catapults them across the barren Australian outback. To say more would give stuff away. Just get the movie (available in Australia on DVD) and enjoy."
1,KIss or Kill,"Kiss or Kill is one of my favorite movies, but this seller is lucky I don't call the FCC because it's against the law to distribute items without a copyright. THe DVD I received was PURE BOOTLEG. He used a black and white camcorder to record the original version and then sold it for a HUGE profit. I want my money back!! He doesn't even deserve one star, but I had to give him one. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS DEALER."
4,Another interesting novel by Ann Rinaldi,"""Girl in Blue"" was a very good book, but not like Ann Rinaldi's other Historical Fiction novels. There were times while reading it I felt lost, for example Sarah's abusive father. I would have liked if there had been a scene with them together, or perhaps a detailed flashback. I would have also liked it if Sarah wrote home to her brother, Ben, in secret. That might have given the story more depth. My final complaint is when she goes ""undercover"" - it became very confusing, and I think that is what Rinaldi wanted. This story really showed how women can pull their own, just as good as men. I don't think this will be Ann Rinaldi's most memorable novel, but certainly one that deserves to be read. I recommend."
3,"A light, quick read with a strong female lead","I'm a fan of historical fiction, especially when it comes to the Civil War, so I gave this one a shot. It was a fun, quick read, although I would have liked to have seen more emphasis on characterization. I'm an adult male, but I have no problem reading about a teen female lead character; I just wish she was fleshed out more in the book. But Rinaldi does a good job of inserting historical information without slowing the pace of the book. More for the young adult crowd, though old fogies like me will still enjoy it."
4,Girl in Blue,"This book is about a girl who runs away from her home because her dad is making her marry someone she doesn't want to, she runs away and enlists in the army and then she is fighting in the Civil War. But the book isn't all about a girl fighting in the Civil War but you have to read the book to figure that out. I think it would actually appeal to some people who rarely read historical fiction, and like mystery.The bad things about this book are:-sometimes I didn't fully understand what was going on, pretty much because a sentence had too many words I didn't know but that didn't happen often.-The ending wasn't that good!! You work up to a character and what happens with that character?!?!? It just falls out of the book.But otherwise its a pretty good book, its gotten me interested in the subject. So I'd recommend it if you like historical fiction."
4,Girl in Blue Book Review,"This was definately a great book focusing on the Civil War. I enjoyed it very much. I compared it even from reading the summary on the back of the book to the story of Mulan; it did not include saving her father from war, but saving herself, in a way. Sarah dreamed of getting away from her dismal home, going off to fight in the war dressed as a boy. I found the romance part to be a refreshing addition to the plot, though found the ending a bit weak. I would recommend this book to girls who like detective novels and heroines, but Rinaldi's Author's Notes supply some information helpful to Civil War projects. I hope this review has been helpful to the undecided."
5,MORE LIKE 10 STARS!,"There are two particular Ann Rinaldi books that I was sorry to finish: The Fifth of March, and this! I loved this book so much! It's about Sarah Louisa Wheelock. She lives in a family with a cruel abusive father who wishes for her to marry a terrible man who is at least twice her age! So, Sarah runs away to join the Union army, pretending to be a young man. After a couple of months of being with it, she is discovered to be a girl! Sarah is placed before the choice of possibly going to jail, or becoming a Pinkerton spy. Read this completely amazing book to see what happens next! I guarrantee you'll soon be adding it to your favorite book list! Who couldn't?! Just read it!"
2,"No More, Please!","The Human League were at the cutting edge of synth pop back in the early eighties, but they really should have given up the ghost when the decade ended, albums like this only tarnish their reputation."
3,Beautiful music...,"Because of hearing a piece on the radio that was absolutely stunning, I ordered this album that included the same piece by the same artists. Sadly, the quality of the recording did not live up to my expectations. The sopranos had a somewhat shrill sound and much of the choral sound seemed a little fuzzy and unclear. Still, the exquisite interpretations by Mr. Shaw made this album very worthwhile. He is sorely missed."
5,Classic,I had this albun on cassette but it was stolen. When I found it on Amazon It was quickly added to my collection. Great eaarly classic stuff. Well restored and sound quality is great. Looking for the other albums.
2,Were the questions for this game written by a man??,"I consider myself to be a fairly intelligent individual, and growing up in a family where a Saturday was spent working on the classic car in the garage, or watching football on Sunday, as a female, I know a lot of male stuff. Even I couldn't answer hardly ANY of the ""male"" questions, since in this game, men answer questions about womanly stuff, and women answer questions about manly stuff. We have played it twice now, and even though the men's team has always had 1 male more in touch with his female side than most, the women have always gotten our butts kicked. It is so one sided it's not even funny. Even the men were saying, it's not even fun since the game lasts basically 10 minutes. One of the men said he even had to think twice about some of the ""male"" questions. If I were anyone looking to get a good party game, I certainly wouldn't put my money out to get this again."
1,Terrible Game,"This is a very poorly designed game, and the questions that the men receive are much easier than the questions for women. For instance, the men will get a ""true or false"" question which means they have a 50% chance of getting it right even if they don't know the answer, whereas the women will get a question that asks them to name three out of four components of an item. After playing it once at a party, we played it a second time having both sides use the questions for women. Guess what? The men struggled as much as the women. My suggestion is to buy Trivial Pursuit if you're wanting to play a trivia game, and stay away from this dog."
2,"Yes, the Questions Were Written By a Man!","I agree with the 2-3 star ratings. The questions were ridiculous. Questions for the men were about today's pop culture and the women were asked about SPECIFIC things about science, history, sports, tools, etc. There were even questions with mistakes in them! Now I can take a joke, but after playing this game, I was more insulted that the makers of this game think these are the only things women are knowledgeable about and think are important."
2,Not what I expected...,"We've played this game twice and it could be so much more than it is...it always seems like the questions are too hard so no one ends up moving their pieces. Beyond that though the 'wild' cards have a pawn move to the other side of the board so, potentially, after you answer 2 cards in a row the game could be over. I'd rather just play Trivial Pursuit since it has better questions and better game play."
1,This board game series is garbage,There are much better games available. Go to BoardGameGeek.com to see the best rated games.I owned Battle of the Sexes: Simpsons edition and it was complete garbage. As far as I can tell the other games in the series are very similar. The questions are stupid and not fun. The game mechanics are terrible. The game takes FOREVER and doesn't play fair at all. Forever meaning it took 2 hours and we were only barely halfway through. We didn't even finish the game.
1,battle of the sexes game,"so disappointed in the questions, and would prefer to return itfor a full refund. the questions were like the game of trivialpursuit. that was not what I was looking for"
3,Harder Questions for the Female,"The game was very educational; however, felt the questions asked the famale were much more difficult that the ones for the male. It was still a lot of fun."
3,Fun the first time,"This game was a ton of fun the first time we played, but then when we tried to play again with a group we already knew most of the answers. Limited playability, but fun while it lasts."
2,Questions way too tough,"We've only played this twice but both times the game dragged on so long, in order to end the game we had to switch so the women answered the girl questions and the men answered the boy questions. We found the questions are way too difficult, and the board movement was boring."
3,Somewhat Fun,The game was in great condition upon arrival. The questions for the women were much harder than expected and it took a lot away from the fun.
3,"Good basic, but no Furminator","It's a DUAL blade! That makes it *twice* as good as a single blade...I think. This is an average, useful grooming product for dogs with undercoats--the blade is a little lightwight, but seems to do the job. Until you purchase the Furminator, that is. I have to admit I haven't used this once since the Furminator arrived."
5,Great tool,"but I can't get my husband to use it often enough,lol . We have a chocolate lab who sheds all year long it seems. If we comb him regularly we have way less hair indoors on our floors.."
5,Border Collie sits still for it!,"Our newly adopted Border Collie doesn't like much grooming and even brushing can be a chore. But he settles right down and lets us go over him with this handy little tool. It takes a TON of fur off. Be sure you're sitting in a place you can easily clean! So glad one of our daughters told us about this product. Inexpensive, feels good for the dog, and works really well."
2,Poor recording,"You cannot enjoy this CD. Volume has to be increased substantially to listen to this, there is also a hiss on the recording which is disturbing."
5,A great way to learn or review basic French vocabulary!,"This is a real fun book with which you can learn basic vocabulary (clothes, animals,countryside, home, parts of the body, around town, useful expressions).It contains games and puzzles like matching games, find the hidden objects, search a word, label the picture, etc. and tear-out flashcards to memorize the words. In the beginning, it has a pronunciation guide describing the sounds of French and of course it contains the answer key to check your progress.Vocabulary doesn't need to be a pain anymore with this book! (What a pity that they haven't published something similar for intermediate vocabulary!)"
3,It's OK,I bought it for myself but ended up giving it as a gift to a very bright child. It was well received.
2,save your money,"This was not what I expected. I thought there would be more sound, but it's just a dull thunk. Don't waste your money, if you want something that others can hear when your out on a trail."
1,"wanted to give a ""0"" rating, but was not given the option","Sorry, no One can change the bible, pure and simple...no one. Those who try are just making fools of themselves and are destroying any chance of a credible career in writing. Wake up, pay attention and research what is really going on with the UN. If and when you do that... maybe, you will have just enough credibility left to salvage your career in writing."
4,It's a great book! Must-read for teens!,"""One Fat Summer"" is about a teen named Bobby. He is overweight and he doesn't like his body. This book can give teens some self-confidence in themselves and can encourage teens to have a great summer and not to let others put them down. I recommend this book to anyone who has a mature attitude and can handle lots of details. This book contains many details. Easy to understand if you're interested!"
5,This book is full of everything! It is very well written!,"I like this book because it has a lot of action and I can relate to some of Bobby's experiences. I also like this book because it was well -written with very good adjectives for all the characters. Also, all the characters play a strong role and help a lot for the main character, Bobby. I think the book has a good title because it fits what the story is about. It is filled with suspense, joy(expecially the end),drama, love, and much more!! One Fat Summer rarely has any mistakes; like skipping parts which is good for young readers to read and follow. That is another reason I like it is because it is good for young and older people. This teaches young people how life was back in the fifties, so that life doesn't repeat its mistakes!! And this book was the best book read so far by my reading class!!"
1,A poorly written book parents should beware of.,"One Fat Summer is the story of an overweight teenager made fun of by the local teens in a summer resort. He's over-worked and under-paid by Dr. Kahn, who he takes a summer job with. He lies about his job, he covers up for his sister who is sneaking out of the house with her boyfriend, and he is beaten-up and assaulted at gunpoint by the local bully. There are several innuendos of an adult nature and no alternative behaviors, aside from violence, to resolve conflict. The ending is poorly written, leaving you wondering what happens to him. Unfortunately, this story leaves you with the message that if you're overweight you can only feel good about yourself if you lose weight, its ok for others to make fun of you, and violence is an acceptable solution to your problems. In this day and age this is no message to be sending our children."
1,I don't get the point of this book,"I had to read this in seventh grade as part of our growing up unit. I didn't get the point of the book or why the teacher made me read this book when other kids were reading other books. any how The story was about a fat boy with no self confadance. Basically he didn't get any untill he started to lose weight. His best friend got a nose job and got confidance. so I guess the moral of the story is looks are important. There was a scene in the book that hinted at masturbation that went right over my head at the time, but as an adult I find not aceptable for the age group that is actually reading it. Better suited to kids about three years older."
3,I didn't like the ending because it left things still undone,"I read this book in my middle school reading class. I think the author should have had something done to one of the characters like, maybe Willie would go to jail, or Bobby would lose more weight and not be made fun of. Also, maybe he could have written about the response people gave about Joanie's new nose. Maybe he also could have said that Pete and Michelle where allowed to go out together again. He left many things unsaid. I may read the other two books that go with this series to see if some of my questions are answered."
3,A great book for everyone.,"I really liked this book because it kept me in suspence and something was always happining to Bobby, the main character. You never knew what it was going to happen but something always did. My favorite character was Bobby because no matter what happened to him he never gave up. I would recommend this book for someone who likes suspence and action because this book is full of both."
4,One Fat Summer is a good book for teens with low-confidence,"I am a student at a Middle School and This book was really good. It boosts your self-confidence if you are down in the dumps. This helps you understand how a Fat teenager's summer can be: Exciting, unpredictable, surprising, depressing, uplifting and helpful."
3,An ok book to read,In the book one fat summer bobby marks is fat.I gave it 3 stars because i did not like the whole stoy but i like certain parts of the book.The part i like is when bobby stand up to willie becuase he wants to kill him. I did not like pete marino because he is like perfect because he is a diver. He thiks he is the best person in the world.But if you want to know if willie rumson kills bobby marks you will have to read the story.Over all i like the boob one fat summer so i think you should read it.
4,One Fat Summer,Earleir this year I read a book called One Fat Summer by Robert Lipsyte. I thaught this was a pretty good book to read. It had alot of action in it. The main charector in the book is an extremely overweight boy who is always getting made fun of. There was always one kid that made fun of him and tried to beat him up. One time he got his revenge on the kid that made fun of him. I recomed this book for you to read.
4,very readable young adult book,"I started this book for all the wrong reasons. Lipsyte was suppose to have a dark sense of humor; humor can almost not get dark enough for my taste. It was such a readable tale that I was absorbed before I recognized it as young adult.Still, as a sixty- something person, his writing style was so enjoyable and I cared for his bumbling group of lake people. I didn't put it down, enjoyed every sophomoric dry witty moment. The moral was spot on as well.Every summer cottage should have a copy of this book lying casually around on a table."
4,Teenage Favorite,A book I read as a teen that was one of my favorite. Showed how goals can be reached through hard work. A job helps this boy learn some lessons one summer.
3,Quotables,"We believe the author created Bobby as a dynamic, emotional character. First, he wants to prove to his father his usefullness. He tries to prove that to his father by getting a job. Second, he stood up to Willie Rumson, the bully, although Willie held a gun at the time. He was scared but stood up anyway. Last, he wanted to be thin. He often dreams of himself waking up thin. Even though we didn't really like this book, the author created some really good characters, that provide an emotional message."
4,I thought this book was Great,This book one fat summer was a great book. This was the first book I actually wanted to read on my own with out having a teacher force me to. The book starts out alright but as you get to the middle of the book it slows down a lot. But as you get towards the end of the book and the confrontation between Bobby Marks and Willie Rumson it picks up more with action. Over all I really thought this book was great. I recommend anyone to read it.
4,"It is a great book, it will keep you going","I really like this book for it's descriptive detail that the author displays so well. The characters are well described as are the scenes and actions. The setting takes place in the 1950's. The main characters are: Bobby Marks, an overweight Jewish kid, Willie Rumson, a ""hood"" who has nothing better to do than pick on Bobby, and Bobby's sister Michelle, who dates Pete Marino; an Italian Catcholic. Pete Marino is very well respected and loves rising out of the water from diving, and hearing the crowd clap for him. Dr. Kahn plays an important role too. He hires Bobby for a lawn job, but isn't too nice. The author describes his eyes ""like shotgun barrels"", plus he pays Bobby less than what he said he would pay. I recommend you read this book, because it is a very good book."
2,Beware of offensive language,"Bobby Marks, an overweight teenager, is spending his vacation with his family at Rumson Lake. In order to make something worthwhile out of the summer and be away from people who kid him about his weight, Bobby got a job. The quality of his work improves until he is bullied by Willie Rumson. Bobby finds out how terrifying, exhiliarating, dangerous and wonderful one fat summer can be.This book should be for mature readers only. Language and phrases may be offensive and subject matter is meant for younr adults at the very least."
2,One Fat Summer,I dont like this book because there is no action stuff in it. I mean its about a boy who hates summers and it exsplains why but not a very good reason. Like he hates summers because he is fat and he doesnt want people to see him in a swimsuit. But there should be more included in that. some people like books that keep you hooked you wanna read more. But this book does not have that hook.
2,This book is ok,"The book wasn't my type of book to read. It's about a boy that is over weight. One July, 4, Bobby (the oer weight boy) got to go to see the fireworks because it was cool and he could where heavy clothes so the other people couldn't tell that he was fat. He got a job of mowing for a rich person and had a conflict with him and then got rehired to mow."
4,Great teenage book,I read this book this year for my 9th grade English class. At first I did not expect to like it because I was late picking a book and there was a slim choice of books left to read. Boy was I wrong! I loved this book! It really explains teen unsecurity perfectly! I suggest this book to any teenager unsecure of your body.
4,I thought this book was great!,This book is about a boy named Bobby who is very much overweight. He always gets made fun of. He hates the summmer because that's when people wear the least amount of close and he is very self conscious about his body. He hates the fact that he can't cover himself up in sweaters and jackets because the weather is too warm. He gets a summer job at a man named Dr. Khan's house. He has to do lawn work all summer and is constantly afraid that he is going to be beat up by a boy who has problems and thinks the only way to feel better is to try to beat up Bobby. I found this book very interesting and I found that it was very hard to put down because I couldn't wait to see what happened next! I would recommend this book to anyone because I feel that anyone could enjoy this book no matter what their interests in books are.
4,One Fat summer,"I think that this book tells a story about many people and there lives. Like how some people might have a very low selfasteam like Bobby in the beggining of this book or they might have one like Bobby at the end of the book in other words fairly high. Another thing that I likes about this book is the Plot this plot takes place in up state New York rite next to a lake that they like to call Rumson Lake. Bobby is a fat 14 year old boy who doesnt have alote of friends, and Joanie is a shie young girl with an abnoxios nose. Willie on the other hand is an x Marine jurk who doesnt stop making fun of Bobby and Joanie. Bobby's sister michele is an 18 year old who sneaks out of the house every chance that she gets. She is also datting Pete marino who is the owner of Rumson lake.Well I hope that you enjoyed my interview and I hope I have talked you into reading One Fat Summer"
4,Fantastic but realistic,"You really like Bobby and want for things to go easily for him. You want his Dad to pay more attention, you want him to get through the summer with little ridiculing about his size, and most of all you really want him to prove that he can suceed at his job!At the the end you get all that and more! An entertaining read!"
3,A nice compliation of alternative approaches to treating ASD,"This is a good book for parents as an overview of alternative treatments for ASD children. Note, it contains some approaches not all approaches of alternative medicine. I would sincerely recommend this book but if you are a parent looking at all alternatives, including Children with Starving Brains by Dr J. McCandless as well. These two books will provide you all the information you need in evaluating next steps with a good, thoughtful, forward thinking doctor."
1,Snake oil unfit for publication,"Do not buy this book; it is pseudoscientific garbage. You might as well believe in creationism or supply-side economics. The author is spreading false cures to autism. She invokes Andrew Wakefield as an authority, unaware he has been absolutely discredited. This is cruel, false hope--it should never have been published. Pure quackery."
5,Novelli Is An Expert At Compiling Great Teacher Ideas!,"Joan Novelli, the author of this title, has developed an outstanding line of teacher resource books with the Fresh & Fun line by Scholastic! Other titles include: Valentine's Day, Thanksgiving, Kids' Names, Halloween, Teeth, and one for every month of the year (coming in October/November)! This book is full of great ideas to share with classroom children or just your own kid(s). From teaching kids about pictographs to having kids research the day they were born, this book uses the study of birthdays to teach so many things. Along with Novelli's ideas you'll find teachers from all over the country who have contributed incredible ideas!"
5,Easy to install and perfect performance.,I replaced the old supports in a few minutes and the rear liftgate is back to its old self. Even in 11 below zero F they are working perfectly. The price is right for these strong performers.
5,"Great Product, easy to install",These liftgate lift supports work great! They were easy to install and the liftgate works like new.
1,"Received 2 lefts, not a left and a right.","I ordered a pair of struts and received 2 left hand struts, not a right and a left. The center shafts do not turn so you need a left and right pair. If someone orders a pair they should automoatically get a left and right. Who would replace 2 lefts or 2 rights? No one."
5,Works great,They work much better than the tired old ones. The installation took about 5 minutes. Now I don't have to hold the hatch up any more.
4,Good Product,"Product is very affordable, shipped quickly, and was easy to install. Only took a matter of minutes to go from a rear lift gate that would fall and hit you in the head to being self supportive."
3,Not really a study guide; duplicates other information,"This ""Study Guide"" isn't really a study guide. It is a collection of sample exams with a verbose introduction. It duplicates much of information available at the collegeboard website. The bulk of the book is in the form of sample tests, one for each of the 34 subject examinations. The information provided in this book is an exact duplicate of the subject study guides (which can be purchased for $6 and downloaded). So, if you intend on purchasing four or more of the subject study guides, you save money by purchasing this book.The CDROM ""cd sampler"" can be downloaded from the collegeboard website for free. More importantly, it does not contain any sample questions. It is basically a demo that walks through the computer exam. For anyone with any level of comfort with a computer, it can be used as a drink coaster."
3,Where's my guide?,"After reading this book I was puzzled by it's title ""Clep Official Study Guide 2002"". This is actually a collection of sample exams with a verbose introduction. If you are excited about the CDROM and think this will be an interactive practice test medium, sorry. Be prepared for a hand holding presentation about the CLEP world. The CDROM was very disappointing to me. This title barely meets a usefulness rating."
4,Good general information about thin-client,"This book is pretty new in thin-client field. I got the general(not too technical) concept and information from this book. If you are a freshman in thin client field, this book is a good start. After this book, you may try the ""Windows NT Thin Client Solutions"" from Todd W. Mathers & Shawn P. Genoway or ""Windows NT Terminal Server and Citrix MetaFrame"" from Ted Harwood. From the two books, you can get more detials about thin client computing."
2,SpinMaster Power Ranger Home Studio,This was a great product for the one time that it was used. The punching bag has been used for other pruposes. But the product as a whole is a waste of money. The bag is durable; it has really been put through a workout. I wouldn't waste my $$ or time on it again.
5,This is an Excellent Album,"Ronnie really showcases his guitar chops on this album. The drums, whether programmed or live, are much better than some of the lousy drummers Montrose had worked with in the past. If you like Satriani's music, you will dig this album. If you can find the long out of print Territories, buy that one too."
5,Ronnie was the best...,"This is just one of his incredible solo albums... Though, I like just the plain ""Montrose"" albums more, this is just as sweet as every other one... I highly recommend this to every fan..."
2,Be prepared to read nothing but mathematics,"I was disappointed to find that this book was nothing but higher order mathematics with ""equivalent"" models. I had hoped to find useful, easy to understand text with some illustrations about driver considerations, cone and baffle design, crossover design and modeling- everything for an experienced hobbist to quickly get up to speed about speaker design. This book is aimed for those interested in mathematical theory and equivalent modeling of speakers- more for an audio graduate student."
5,May someday come true....Great Read.,"Goldsteine elequently describes the differences between the liberal dilemas we all face today. After all, as Goldsteine argues, we are all liberals. What makes us liberal and what is the connection to our past...This book is doomed to become a classic and may even come true to life."
5,Ferrous Sulfer Elixir by Rugby sold by Pharmafrag,We have been ordering this product for some time as an iron supplement and the orders are always delivered by the time promised or before. The product is very effective and we highly recommend it for those struggling with iron problems.
5,Does everything it's supposed to do.,I bought this and its matching tongue cutter UP032 and they both work fine. They cut smoothly and make a nice tight joint.
4,THE ULTIMATE DRESS-UP FOR LITTLE GIRLS,"What little girl doesn't love to play dress-up? And, surely the ultimate dress-up is being a bridesmaid.Sarah Gibb seems to know this and has provided youngsters with a pretty pink book filled with pictures, activities, and goodies. Sophie is the lucky young lady who has been asked to be a bridesmaid at her aunt's wedding.Excitement mounts as wedding preparations get underway, and Sophie's personal preparations begin. Young readers can join in the fun as the time comes for choosing a bridesmaid dress, and planning a special hairdo.The sturdy pink book has a padded cover with an illustration of Sophie in her finery along with the bride. Enjoyment abounds as youngsters find the book holds confetti, a picture frame, floral hair accessories, a heart-shaped pendant, a pink bead bracelet, and even stick-on jewel earrings.Here comes the bride and her bridesmaid!"
5,Great Learning Tool!,I can Make It is a great borad book for toddlers. Insie you will find pictures of little ones showing things they can make.It ranges from a picture on the wall to a shadow on the sidewalk.Your child will start to think of all the fun things they can make too. Great pictures.....great fun.
5,"Just look around, does anything stand up against it?","From my point of view this is Sick Of It All at thier very best. Polished just right by RATM producer GGGarth, never had the band been so tight and explosive. Lyrics are my favorite of any hardcore cd out there, catchy, uplifiting but raw and aggressive. Perfection in hardcore, the machine only gets tighter from here on out. The best place to start when digging in the SOIA treasure trove. One Step Ahead, Good Lookin' Out, Burn 'Em Down, Closer... pretty much all the songs on here are great, just let it all sink in. Oh and BTW this has not left my CD stack for 5 or 6 years so... Built To Last, TRUTH."
1,This cd is horrible,Do not buy this cd. It is the worst excuse for music that i have ever heard in my life. THe lyrics are horrible and my four year old brother can play the guitar better than those sorry muscians if that's what you consider them.
1,...,"save up your money and buy some digital speakers, these have the quality of a subwoofer and 2 regular computer speakers."
3,Wish I could buy from someone else,"I still like the product but a bad shopping experience has tainted my rating. My hairdresser used this and recommended it on me for years because I have natural waves that often get frizzy. It goes on wet or dry hair to tame the frizz and keep the curl without the stickiness of other stuff. Works on long and short hair and doesn't add weight. It also has a slight glimmer that adds shine without sparkles. Unfortunately, when it was shipped, the top wasn't tightened and some spilled out onto the bubble wrap- at $4+ per ounce, it was a waste. Also the bottle holds only 8.2oz and all the ordering information and invoice say 8.5oz. Where are the other .3 ounces? Sounds like packaging was changed but marketing hasn't caught up with the downsizing. I wish I could buy from someone else but at the time there was only one seller. Though I don't want to return it, I sent email with my concerns and have no reply to date."
2,not impressed,not that i was looking for a collar that would last forever but this one didnt make it very long at all before it was faded and fraying ....also was smaller then i thought it would be
3,"Good Selection, but bad binding.","I love and hate this book. It has one of the best Chopin collections I've seen in a single book, but the binding is not good. I doesn't lay flat, and the pages fall out. I wouldn't suggest buying this book for that reason alone. It's also not a wonderful edition. I think for the price, it's not worth it."
3,Selection does not corresponds to the book's name,"I am a little disappoited in this book because of the selection of the works. Although there are 55 pieces selected, it does not contain such wonderful pieces like Fantasie-Impromptu, Op. 66, or Mazurka op. 68 Nr.2. Furthermore, most pieces are not fingered."
2,Not really magic,"I've never really been a big fan of Erroll Garner amd his choppy style of playing. However, the one real bright spot on album is the haunting ""NIGHTWIND"". I fell in love with this song years ago and have been looking for an album with it."
5,"Using ""How to Really Parent Your Child""","My wife and I found Ross Campbell's ""How to Really Love Your Child"" very helpful when we were raising our three daughters, who are now in their 20s & 30s. This book has already been a good refresher course for me as a grandfather, or rather ""grampy"" as my granddaughter calls me. I plan on using this book to do a pilot series of four parenting talks, which will address info in the first four chapters. This text provides very useful and practical parenting guidance. Ross Campbell is not apologetic about addressing the topic from a Christian perspective; but I do not think he is too heavy handed. I think readers of all faiths will find lots of useful parenting suggestions."
5,I loved this book,"Sara Mitchell Parsons was one of the true heroes of the Civil Rights Movement in Atlanta. As a white woman from a privileged background, she took on the racist status-quo of Atlanta as a school board member and constantly and intelligently challenged the city to provide quality education for black and white students alike and to integrate the schools. She knew when it was time to leave her hidebound racist husband and she knew when it was time to leave the Civil Rights Movement though she continued to work for equal education for her entire life. She was a courageous and forceful influence for many young men and women of the 60s in Atlanta. I was one of those."
4,jangle pop a la c86,"this album was one of those that opened the door for me to stuff like stone roses, biff bang pow, the pale saints, etc... released back in 1987, i think it's their best (though the ""what is there to smile about"" EP IS great too), most accessible effort. it's all bitter cynicism on top of jangly pop guitars. (the lyrics sort of take themselves a bit too seriously, but whaddya want?)if you're a fan of the smiths, soft boys, aztec camera, etc, you will love them. my favorite tracks (still feel as good today & they did then): ""i kiss the flowers in bloom"" & ""in spite of these times."" wonderful."
4,jangle pop a la c86,"this album was one of those that opened the door for me to stuff like stone roses, biff bang pow, the pale saints, etc... released back in 1987, i think it's their best (though the ""what is there to smile about"" EP IS great too), most accessible effort.it's obvious these guys listened to a lot of smiths, soft boys, & the like so if you're a fan of the bitter cynicism on top of jangly guitars, you will love them. my favorite tracks (still feel as good today & they did then): ""i kiss the flowers in bloom"" & ""in spite of these times."""
3,"Lots of detailed info, but...","Much like other reviewers, I though this book contains a huge amount of well researched and detailed information, but is barely readable due to the poor standard of english. Sure, you can't expect Shakespeare in a ""car-book"", but sentences that you have to read three times to understand are too much. Short and simple sentences would much improve this book - Sounds like advice for a 3rd grade student!"
2,"Well researched, poorly written","This is one of those books that tempts you with interesting subject matter, a nicely organized table of contents, wonderful photos (though none in color), and a fascinating array of tables in the appendix. But I was let down by the truly terrible writing. As mentioned in another review, the text is poorly organized and skips from topic to topic with little rhyme or reason. Non sequitors are the order of the day. Basically unreadable. Which is too bad, because the 3ers -- possibly the finest line of sport sedans ever created -- really deserve to have their story told properly."
4,Nazi Nightmare,"This book is for readers who like to curl up in their favorite chair, turn the lights down low, and be scared out of their wits. Try reading this during a storm for maximum effect. This story will send chills like cold fingers down your spine. The details are so vivid the reader will imagine he/she is fleeing and fighting Nazi spirits alongside the main character. C'mon Robert, write us another one!"
3,"creepy throughout, creaky only in a couple of places","We shouldn't be too critical of McCammon for this one because there's a sixteeen year long learning curve between the Night Boat and Mine and he obviously learned much. The Nazi dead are really well characterized. The plot is creaky at the end. Some scenes are so well done that you really are there. Wonderful book cover with that U-boat bearing down on you with the skulls on board. Proves my theory that book sales are increased whenever anything Nazi is on the cover. E.G., Jack Higgins, Ken Follett, etc..."
3,Ok.,"This is an ok read, not great and not a totall loser. It is simple and, as they with 'one dimensional' characters and plot. Still, it was fun enough for a thirty or so year old chiller with some descriptive carribean island locales."
4,GREAT EARLY EFFORT!,"It's been years since I read this book but remember enjoying it immensely. I was already familiar with the author's work through Boy's Life, and even after that poignant story this book was not a disappointment. Though Night Boat is definitely lighter fair, McCammon is still able to elicit an emotional response, something he's quite good at. The end of the book nearly had me as choked up as Boy's Life and Swan Song. If you like zombie stories and intelligent fiction, give this one a try."
1,Oops...,"Robert R. McCammon is a writing god. This book should have been sacrificed. In all honesty, I haven't finished this book yet. Although I've started three times. McCammons amazing imagry and character development sunk further than that submarine in the Carribean. This author is great. This book is not."
1,Horrible book From a great author,"How bad can a good author get? To write something as superbas the ""Wolf's Hour"" and then read this. A story of asubmerged submarine from WW2 washing ashore. Fresh withNazi ghosts. Not a bad premise but the book sunk! ""Badpun"" I love to wonder what kind of excuse the authorwould offer, for such a bad waste of trees! Don't pickup this book run away!"
1,SUCKS!,"This is a terrible product. Nothing more than liquid caulk that doesn't dry. If you so much as touch this product once applied, it will smear everywhere."
4,Better than I thought...,"I must say that I was pleasantly surprised with this produt. I was skeptical at first, but my hair really loves this stuff! The one concern I have is that it's hard to work the product up to the scalp. I have really thick, unrelaxed curly hair and it doesn't clean my scalp as well as I would like. I may have to just work more product directly onto my scalp. But overall, I think it's a great product and it really does amazing things for my curls."
3,"Smells great...was great first two uses. Now, not so great","I've used it 3 or 4 times now. The first time I used it I thought it was a miracle. Now, after a few uses, my hair felt exactly the same as it does with any other shampoo. In fact, as I was rinsing it after shampooing with this, my hair felt kind of ""dry"" in the shower, just as it would after regular shampoo. The first time I used this, it was the first time my hair did NOT feel that way. But, it seems it was only a miracle the first time I used it. The only thing I can think of is the first and second times I used it, I styled with the B'Leave in product but then the next time I used a sample of curl creme from the deva line that they gave me when I purchased. Hmmmm."
2,Not for oily hair,"I noticed some folks are talking about Low-Poo too. Yes, No Poo is not for oily hair. The Curly Girl book tells us that too. Use Low-Poo. The stylist washed my hair w/No Poo today even tho I told her it would be too heavy and sure enough, way too heavy. PI don't like the way it feels -- like conditioner needing to be rinsed out. Sshe also used Angel and some other leave in thing. Too much on the goopy side, and too much fragrance for me. plus I don't like the smell of the products. I prefer fragrance free. I personally don't mind my frizzy curls. I like hair that doesn't look wet, and curls that don't look man-made. I have Boticelli plus wavy curls, plus oily. I get compliments on my hair all the time, when I don't use product in it, and when I don't use Deva Curl. I love the cutting method, not the products."
5,Super Great!,"Deva Curl No Poo leaves my hair smooth and easy to manage. Making the transition from lots of lather to no lather was ""interesting"" but the end results are GREAT!"
1,BEWARE! Formula has changed and now it's AWFUL!,"I have been using DevaCurl products for about two years with success and satisfaction. I recently purchased a new 32 oz No Poo to replace my almost empty bottle. Within a couple weeks, my head was itching like crazy and I was scratching and finding residue all over my scalp! I had heard that the formula changed back around 2009, and it made me wonder if that happened again.Sure enough, I just compared the two bottles, and the formula has changed! Among other differences, the newer bottle had the betaine ingredient (the ""cleansing"" part) much lower on the list, which I'm guessing caused the buildup. If you are a repeat customer, I encourage you to compare the ingredients. If you need more info, comment here and I will copy down the two different ingredients list."
4,Curls gone wild,"My 17 year old daughter and 16 year old son were blessed with beautiful curls. Unfortunately beautiful curls can also be a curse without the right shampoo. Now they are blessed with great shampoo! A bit on the expensive side and not available in stores, but overall well worth the compliments they receive on their lovely hair."
5,Deva Products,"I have been using Deva products for curly hair for about 6 years now, and they are phenominal! To top it off, I have been having my hair done by a Deva certified hair stylist in my local area, and she has also taught me how to get the most from these products. All of the products are natural, and do not have ""plastic"" or any crazy chemicals."
1,WHAT IS GOING ON?,"Purchased a 4 oz travel size Deva Curl No Poo to give it a try. It was fantastic! My hair became soft as silk, shiny, the color did not fade and I could go 2 days between washings. Every day was a good hair day. So I gladly invested and purchased a 32 oz bottle having found my new and favorite hair product of all time. UNTIL 3 weeks later. My hair is now sticky, gunky, limp, not shiny and weighed down. WHAT IS GOING ON? How do I get my beautiful hair back? Can any one shed some light on this?"
4,like the product,"I havn't any problem with the product but the tightening of the bottle lid should be looked into. The bottle was wrapped in plastic but in the plastic some of the product had leaked out, about 2 tablespoons. Otherwise it was great."
5,thank you,"YAY! the word requirement is absolutely, positively ridiculous. i can't imagine why you want to torture your customers this way."
5,"Best product for curly, thick hair!","I have extremly thick and waivy/curly hair. Devacurl calms my hair, makes it more curky and more managable. Have been using it for 2 years now; even take it with me when I travel overseas."
2,Too harsh,"Too harsh for my hair! I bought this to try when I first started the curly girl method. I don't really like it, because it always leaves my hair feeling dry and coarse. I much prefer aloe or a lightweight conditioner for scalp cleansing."
1,Gives me dandruff !!,Switched from DevaCare Low- Poo (orange colored one) to this and it was definatley a mistake !! It took me awhile to figure out it was giving me dandruff which I have never ever had before !! Beside it smells awful and feels like its harsh even though its not suppossed to be.
5,Gentle and non-drying replacement for shampoo,"I was introduced to this product, which is used instead of shampoo, at the Devachan Hair & Departure Salon in New York's Soho, massaged into your scalp (it doesn't create a foam, but feels more like cream rinse) and have used it religiously now for years.It's non-drying and my hair (somewhat coarse and wavy) is soft and holds curls, making this an ideal product for those of us who'd previously had frizz and split ends. It's a different approach, scary to some, and is best if you are able to try the salon, where hair washing includes an extraordinary scalp massage, more relaxing than anything you'll get elsewhere."
3,Great the first few times then you have regrets,"I absolutely fell in love with 'no poo' when I was used as a model at a beauty show, so I immediately purchased it with the conditioner and the gel. I loved it the first few times, but then my hair began to feel dirty, heavy & somewhat greasy. I've attempted a purifying shampoo a few times in between, and it works but then what's the point?I also never got used to the no lather part. The conditioner is great in the way you instantly feel softness in your hair (the no poo does that too) so I still use the conditioner on my tips only. The Angel Gel that came in the kit, I never liked it makes your hair feel gritty as soon as it dries.sadly this line didn't work in the end, for me. I'm going back to Nexxus phyto Organics."
1,Horrible Smelling,This stuff is the worst smelling product I have ever used on my hair. Totally disappointing. I thought it would smell ok considering that the styling cream smells wonderful. Needless to say I will be returning this.
1,The scent is UNBEARABLE,"Sure my hair looks better, but the rose scent is so strong, it woke me up at 3am!What's the point of the strong scent Deva? Are you trying to cover something up?"
2,Not worth the money,I bought this after a suggestion from a hair stylist. I hated it. Made my hair feel dirty and sticky. I threw it out and never went back to that stylist.
5,Exhilarating combination,"I saw both the movie and own the soundtrack and highly reccomend it to anybody who wants a good stress relieving or workout music mix. Completely brilliant, and I wish I had gotten hooked on TG sooner than 1995"
4,Paul Westerberg makes this fricking album!,"I can't believe the idiot in the Amazon review that says ""Let's Do It"" is the only lame song. It is the only great song on the album! The rest of the stuff is neat, but ""Let's Do It"" truly shines. Paul's voice is on and his guitar playing is crisp! Moron!"
4,All around good mix...,"Where else can you find Hole, Bjork and Portishead all on the same cd?? Nowhere that I know except on this soundtrack...its an eclectic mix and I like it. The movie was terrible, but the soundtrack is excellent!!"
4,The CD more than makes up for the movie,"Normally, I hate soundtracks but there's something about this one. From Stomp's ""Ripper Sole"", which alone is more than worth the price of admission, straight through Ice T's ""Big Gun"", the CD is a great ride through a variety of musical styles and personalities.The movie was...OK, dumb...but what do you want? It was a low budget adaptation of an obscure comic dripping in melodrama and tongue-in-cheek goofiness. The movie simply stayed true to its source material, and there's something to be said for that.Sill, the CD is much, much better. The musical selections are well chosen, and despite its age, the soundtrack is still a lot of fun."
3,"RE the ""Let's Do It"" track","Just a quick note on this song featuring Paul Westerberg: the original version actually featured Bad Religion's Greg Graffin as the other half of the duo. Yes, Paul's vocals did suck but Greg's were rockin', as usual. If you guys have a chance, download the version with Greg and this soundtrack will be complete."
3,Good cutter-Poor Instructions,"I needed a lock miter cutter with a 1 1/4"" bore that would do 1 1/4"" thick material and this fit the bill. It was the only one I could find to do that thickness- most only do up to 1"". This is two matched cutters and spacer shims.There were no instructions included and the Freud website had none. It is necessary to have about .100 stack of shims between the two to get the correct tongue. Once the shims were right the set up was fine and the cutter worked well."
4,Cerebral...light on the cheese...very good.,"Eternal life...wouldn't that be nice? Alas, it's too good to be true. Tetsuro's odyssey to restore flesh and blood to the dry, emotionless, mechanized universe is something you don't want to miss. The animation was smooth, pretty heavy on the violence but the gore isn't very explicit(but then, I saw it on the Sci-Fi channel, so I'm not sure). The action scenes were plentiful and absolutely dynamic. That Tetsuro kid is a bad little dude. The drama of the plot will pull at you without getting cheesy and the tiny little plot twists that seem confusing at first come full circle and make it a really epic film. See it."
3,"Mediocre, not too impressed.","I bought these because I foster kittens on a regular basis and sometimes they are newborns. These are very large for feeding something so small. I'm going to stick with the 1ml syringe for that purpose. I'll keep these on hand but the tips are just too hard for feeding such delicate little things. Probably work best for an older animal, but again, the tips are hard. Will it serve it's function...absolutely, but the tips need to be comfortable."
5,A sharp look into an oft-misunderstood corner of the military,"Excellent book for those already in PSYOP who are looking for real-life insight into future deployments. Well-written, easy to understand on personal and professional levels for those who have been in the military, and probably those who are researching from the outside. Very little has been publicly disclosed about this low-profile corner of the military whose existence ultimately centers around one sole principle: to save lives, first of our soldiers and local civilians, then any enemies who they might induce into going our way... see for yourself. A MUST- READ for PSYOP personnel before their first deployment as such."
3,Has its moments,"Busta mixes some great grooves with his lyrics making for a couple really great songs. Overall though, the CD fails to hook the listener. I find myself skipping some sections of the CD entirely."
4,Don't ever disrespect!,This is as good as it get with this dude. This album does not try to be any thing but what it is : a hardcore East Coast album with a party vibe. The raw sh*( is Abandon Ship and Ill Vibe.The Coming will sound just as dope in 2014.
4,An amazing little book.,"I saw this guy on the Today Show and he was very captivating and creative. His book is the same way, with pretty cool ideas on how to make gatherings unique using ""green"" products. It makes a great gift, too."
2,Some useful stuff. Back to basics and history.,"As someone with a general scientific background, I found this book high on padding and relatively low on the content I wanted and was expecting - the author spends much time on the history of the subject and on the basic properties of air, leaving little space for details on the physiology and medical side of the subject. I have no medical education or qualifications, though I still found much of the actual medical text in the book over simplified and lacking in detail."
3,A common sense guide to staying safe,"This is an emminently sensible and easy to read guide to avoiding date rape. I can't agree with everything in it but the basic idea that the reader needs to take responsibility for saving her own life impressed me.Kimberley Lindsay Wilson, author of 11 Things Mama Should Have Told You About Men."
1,Hi,The bracelet is well made but I was soooooooooooooooo disappointed in the light light blue stones...they look almost clear. I am thinking of sending it back.
3,frustrating,"This game can be frustrating and annoying.I purchased this game for my 6 year old,she is often annoyed by Mr. Pencils comments.He is a character who is supposed to help,but he interuptes when slight mistakes are made...not very encouraging.The double doodle activity is double frusration,after every line you draw Mr.Pencil is supposed to duplicate it on another part of the screen ,but he draws the lines all over the screen sometimes on top of the picture your trying to draw,this makes my kid nuts!I thought this game would have more art tools for creative work,the cartridge that comes with the leapster has cooler special effects then this.All that said,this game is educational teaching pencil control,color,helping kids draw through tracing and copying.It's OK.....Could have been better."
5,Finally a fun way to practice her skills!!!,Where was Mr. Pencil when I was a child? I bought this cartridge for my four year old daughter who has been practicing writing her letters for about a year now. I have bought her many different kinds of practice books and writing paper only to find that she quickly tires of them. Mr. Pencil keeps her attention by making writing and drawing a fun interactive experience. She loves tracing her letters and numbers with Mr. Pencil. She finds it very easy to complete each task successfully. I feel the customers who have been having problems tracing the letters and numbers must have defective cartridges. I considered not buying Mr. Pencil because of the negative reviews stating the problems of the letter tracing program. I would just like to say I'm glad I purchased it. Mr. Pencil's Learn to Draw and Write is one of Leapster's best.
2,Not for young children,"I love LeapFrog, I love Leapster. I love the game that the Leapster comes with, as well as the Dora and Finding Nemo games. This one just isn't as good. For one, it's for pre-K and K ages but there is reading involved. To me, that just doesn't make sense. One of the games involves catching the colors in a bucket to make the color shown in the upper corner (for example, the color orange is shown, so you would catch the red and yellow drips). The game is timed. The correct color drips don't show up though, so the timer goes off before you can catch the correct colors. What happened, LeapFrog? They completely bombed on this one."
4,My child likes this game But...,I think this game is very hard to do. The maze game is impossible! However my 4 year old never puts it down. She loves it. Her favorite is the doodling. I don't think she is learning anything from it but at least she is having fun. I just wish I didn't spend so much money on it.
3,Mr. Pencil won't let you write!,"I got this for my five year old, and she loves it. She gets so frustrated with it though. Mr. Pencil won't give you a break, he wants to make you write absolutely perfect. If you don't trace something exactly like it says, even just a hair line away, it makes you start all over. I hear my daughter yelling at her Leapster when she has to start over and over on the mazes. She usually just gives up and puts it away. Too bad they are so particular about being right on their lines. This would be a great cartridge, but it is very frustrating. Even my six year old gets mad using this one."
4,Mr. Pencil's Draw and Write,"My 5 yr. old son loves the mazes, but doesn't do too much more with it. BUT, my son doesn't like to draw and write, either. So, it might be a better toy/game for other kids. I thought this might encourage him to draw/write. The mazes are fun for him and one has to stay in the lines to complete the puzzle, so that's good. Other than that I can't tell you too much about it. He's played here and there with it; of course he prefers his more adventurous games like Go Diego Go! and Batman and Cars, but that's ""how he rolls"" - lol! That's what he tells me anyway.I gave it 4 stars b/c I'm not 100% about it, but I do know that Leapster games have really taught my son things and keep his interest. I don't think you can go wrong with this one. My son and I revisit this ""game"" on occasion and I don't hear complaints."
1,wrong teaching,"My 4 year old loves playing this game, but i found out that they are teaching the wrong stuff to kids. This game teaches kids that the primary colors are Red, Blue and Yellow - which is plain wrong. We all know that Red, Blue, Green are the primary colors. How can a learning game get it all wrong, and that too from Leapfrog which claims emphasis on learning. I cant believe they are getting away with teaching wrong concepts. very disappointed."
5,LeapFrog Leapster Learning Game Mr. Pencil's Learn to Draw and Write,I purchased this for my Grandson and I like it very much. It has helped him learn a lot. Good purchase.
4,great teaching tool that is fun,"my 6 year has had an aversion to learning how to draw or write. we have tried so many methods to get him interested; so for his birthday we bought a leapster with this write/draw cart and some math carts. he actually likes it and seems to be doing really well. it is self correcting so he knows right away if he is making the correct letters/numbers/shapes. they have some games to help with dexterity also. it is fun, he enjoys using it and his progress shows."
4,Good game,"My 4 year old got this game for christmas along with the learning system and he doesn't paticlarly like this one as much as some of the other games he's gotten...my 7 year old also tried this game and she got frustrated with it because mr. pencil is really picky about you getting off of the lines..he doesn't give the kids much slack for error, but I tried it and I thought it was really educational!!"
5,LOVE IT,KIDS ARE LOVING THIS GAME. ADKJ ADKJF A LJKF A ADKJF LSAJDF A;FJ A;FJ AFJA;JKF;A ADSFADFAF A AFAF AFAFAFDFA AF
2,change age on this game.,"I felt you need to change the age for the drawing game. My son is eight and it was way to easy., very young for him. It is better more for a pre schooler. I wasted my money on this one. Leapster itself is a great game."
2,Very fustrating,"We got this game for our 4 yr old and thought it would be great to help learn to write his letters. Wrong! It was very fustrating for him. Mr penicl expects prefection, even myself, my husband and my teen daughter had trouble pleasing Mr pencil.the lessons expect to much from kids especially when adults have trouble with it.The only part of the game that was nice was the doodling part. Was a waste of my [money]. I won't let my son play it anymore cause he ends up getting to upset."
3,"Fun , but.............","This program can be very fun, But when you get to the Lessons where your child can practice writing numbers and letters it can be very Tormenting..... I have tried writing the number3 countless times and have yet to please Mr Pencil.Could be a bit discouraging for a child...The other areas are pretty fun But I think they could have added a bit more to the whole program......more coloring pages, stamps, ect...."
2,not so great,I bought this for my 4 year old because he was not to interested in writing and I thought it would help.He likes the painting and doodle part but when he goes to the lessons it will give him two chances to trace the letters and if he dosen't trace it just right it sends him back to the option page he gets really discuraged. It is really picky about how strait the lines are I feel when a kid is learning this is not a great tool to use.
4,For the artiste in your kid.,"My kids like this game more for the picture drawing than the letter writing. Compared to coloring and drawing, there weren't many letter writing activities anyway. In fact, there is only one letter writing activity included. I tried it myself and found it boring to wait for the letter to be drawn and then write the letters. For letter writing, I like the princess Leapster game that has the child trace the footsteps to form letters.The coloring is fun. There are so many color and draw activities. Many of them teach color mixing. My son learned how to draw a few things like a dog and cat from the drawing exercises. There are also lessons in drawing depth/shading and making flip books. The kids get lots of practice using their fine motor skills on this game. I really think this is best marketed as a pre-writing game or art skills game than a writing game."
3,"Very educational, but sensitive stylus reader","My daughter loves this cartridge. She is 4 and this is a great way to learn how to write out letters. She hasn't been interested in the drawing portions, so I don't have comments on that. I gave this a 3 as the screen reader is very particular about your stylus accuracy. If you don't make your line long enough or curvy enough, it does not accept that letter. My daughter has shown frustration with this. It doesn't stop her from trying again, but the level of accuracy needed is too high IMO."
5,I love Mr.Pencil,"Mr.Pencil's Draw and Write is a great game.My favorite game in Mr.Pencil is the Maze Game.This game gave me tons of handwriting skill and taught me how to draw.This a great game for a seven and a half year old like me.So if you like making colors and drawing.Buy Mr.Pencil""s Draw and Write today!"
5,Hooray for Leapster ( and learn to calibrate your unit),"My kindergartner received his Leapster for his 5th birthday and it has been wonderful. Mr.Pencil has been one of his favorites as he loves to color and draw. BUT I love it because, as his class at school adds new letters to their writing skills, he can ""play"" and practice at the same time.As to some of the complaints about the lines being ""off"" from where the stylus traces, it is important to read and follow the instructions for calibrating your unit. Surely my child isn't the only one who is not always delicate with his Leapster, but if it gets off, I just follow in calibration instructions and we're back in the game!"
3,Draw & Write,"In theory, this is a great game. However, my 5 and 4 year old girls seldomly pick it when they have their choice of leapster games. It's cute, but the options are limited."
5,Great Gift,Great learning gift for Christmas for Grandson. He enjoys using this game and is learning with it also. Thank you
3,birthday gift,"for a 3 year old. He does not quite get the hang of it, but hopefully he will grow into it."
5,Great for my 6 y/o,"My 6 y/o played with this for several days straight when it got here. It is very age appropriate, and even though the drawing controls can be a little strict, my kid loves it."
4,Easy to follow,Used by a 2.5 and 4yr old - they both enjoyed it. Worked great until the screen failed after 1yr of use!
4,Title track,"I have a radio recorded version of the title track that clocks in at about 4:40 that has more acoustic instrumentation yet still raw and powerful--much better version for performance and studio production. Anyone know which recording it is from? THAT would be the album to pick up IMO. Good song either way, of course!"
2,written just well enough to keep you turning the pages...,"...but that's about it.This is one of Dubus' first novels, and it shows. The timelines in the story are inconsistent; details that you expect to have an impact are never mentioned again.Nevertheless, I read it thru to the dissappointing end."
4,Dead Georgeous,"I had originally seen Dead Georgeous on PBS. When I found this DVD on your site, I purchased it. The ending will be a surprise to anyone that watches it. My thanks to the author for the unusual story. It was well worth watching and sharing with friends."
4,"Great trainer, low noise. Magneto-driven.","Pros: it folds up nicely and tucks away against a wall. Very small in size. It probably weights 15-20 lbs. VERY sturdy. Cool powdercoat that grabs attention when people walk in the room (not that it matters haha). Magneto driven means that it only has one moving part and is very low noise. In fact, the only noise that I hear is my bike and the whining sound the gears make. Resistance from the roller is steady and consistent.Cons: The magneto-driven wheel has several resistance settings, however when I switch them up or down I don't seem to recognize a difference between them. Don't know if it has something to do with the age of the trainer that I have or whether or not it's working properly. This really isn't a big deal, though. It provides ample amounts of resistance, so all you need to do is tick up your secondary gear to a higher number in order to achieve a harder workout.EXCELLENT TRAINER!"
1,Plastic Support is Weak,The fly-wheel supports are made out of brittle plastic. The plastic supports were broken and the whole flywheel fell off. What a disappointment.
1,Poor Customer Service,"I purchased this product through Amazon thinking it would come in Amazon packing because it wasn't as big as a bike. It arrived in original box and the person for whom it was intended as a Christmas present recieved it in original packae. Christmas surprize RUINED!!!!I contact the company and basically they said, ""Your tough luck!!"" What a disappointment."
3,Not quite Dispatch but yes I like it,"Almost four stars, State Radio has a definitive Dispatch rythm and vibe but it lacks the creative impression that Dispatch listeners fell in love with. A few of the songs are very addicting and you will find yoursef listening to them over and over. Play the whole album through first and then listen to Riddle and Camilo again, you will not be disapointed."
2,written review,"Scent is evident upon opening. Scent does not radiant while burning. If it was, I would know coming down stairwell from first level burning. This candle is room decor only."
3,A Glimpse of Soccer's Past,"Eddie Hapgood was a stalwart of the highly successful Arsenal soccer team of the 1930s and early 1940s. His autobiography is basically a collection of anecdotes, but gives a fascinating insight into a different world: of the Briton abroad sampling foreign countries for the first time; of playing soccer matches in a Europe gradually moving towards the Second World War (for example, in Hitler's Germany and Mussolini's Italy); of playing wartime matches for charity; and of his relationship with legendary players such as Cliff Bastin and Alex James, and managers such as Herbert Chapman. Although the book doesn't give much insight into Hapgood's character, it is a fascinating piece of soccer history."
2,poor,"How many times can or should you write the words""The man who loved to kill""It read like a high school work of fiction"
5,"Wow, great album",Had it since it came out...it's absolutely marvelous. I can't wait for a follow-up. Voice and guitar just sing.
4,"Well written, and accurate","This guide was accurate, except for one thing: Solah is Padme's sister, and Jobal is her mother. This book portrays it as the other way around. But otherwise, a good reference book for the best movie ever!"
5,Awesome,"This is a fabulous book. From the inside of Grievous's MechnoGuards to Mace Windu's lightsaber, this book has got it all. I received this book before I saw the movie, so it was kind of a spoiler, but I didn't care. GREAT BOOK!"
5,Star Wars Dictionary,I really enjoyed this book. The details are amazing and it gave me a lot of insight into important details the movie doesn't touch on.
3,Pictures is good but not information,"I am big Scifi fanatic. The Starwars films are my best. I saw all of them in cinema or video. This book is about Sith (Episode 3rd), which was best of best Starwars movie. My thinking.The book pictures very good- colorful and nice. But the story of the movie is not much in the book. It is confused if you read before you see the movie. I read book after the movie, so no good information. But book is good to have for pictures- I like to look Grevious and Chewbaka pictures."
5,A must have for overthrowing the Dark Side.,"I thought this was going to be a kids book but when I looked inside I realized that Lucas left this behind with detailed instructions on the weaknesses of all the creatures that have joined the dark side. This is a must have, and required reading for anyone who is thinking of becoming a Jedi Knight"
1,Bad fit,This item did not fit the vehicle very well. At high speeds it flaps and the sound is really annoying. Do not buy this. Go to the dealer and pay more but get one that fits.
4,get it.,"Its Clutch, if you're looking at it you must have heard them and know they rock. Just click buy, its ok. ;)"
5,HOW IT SHOULD SOUND,"CLUTCH'S BEST ALBUM. IT SEEMS THIS ALBUM HAS ALL OF THE ELEMENTS THAT CLUTCH HAS BEEN BUILDING ON AND REFINING IN THIER NEWER DEBUTS. IT IS UNADULTARATED LEAN MUSCLE FIBER BOOSTED BY RAW ADRENILINE GLANDS. CLUTCH IS MY FAVORITE BAND AND THIS ALBUM HAS NOT LEFT MY CD CHANGER FOR A LONG TIME. THIS ALBUM ALONG WITH PURE ROCK FURY , ELEPHANT RIDERS & EXODUS MAKES FOR A NICE CLUTCH RATIO. IF YOU LIKE TO JAM TILL THE CLUTCH PLATES NEED REPLACED SPEED SHIFT TO A RETAILER NEAR YOU AND PURCHASE TRANSNATIONAL SPEEDWAY OR PITCHFORK LOST NEEDLES.GOOD LUCK & GOD BLESS."
5,Very cool!,"Of the many Clutch CD's I own, this one has got to be in the top three (the others Elephant Riders and Blast Tyrant) though all are good. This album just has a great set of fun songs with tons of energy. Also, if you've not seen this group in concert and have a chance, do so."
5,Space rock operas are hard to come by,"This album is a space-rock opera complete with a plot, depending on how much you stretch your imagination. Space-rock operas are few and far between and rarely any good, but Clutch pulls it off much better than the Intergalactic Touring Band ever could have. All the tracks have a theme and all the music is good."
4,"It's Clutch, that's what you need to know.","Like the first time I ever watched the Big Lebowski, listened to the Deftones or heard Meshuggah, I didn't know about this album at first. It's simply a departure from the main and sometimes your mind can't wrap around what it really is until 3 or so listens....then suddenly you're in love.It's Clutch with a little earlier agro style more akin to Powerman 5000, but it's still the Clutch you know and love. Buy it."
5,My favorite Clutch,"This is my favorite clutch CD. I know their music has evolved through the years, but this is the album when everything came together. Their last 2 CD's ""blast tyrant"" and ""exodus"" are very close in excellence."
3,Good but least Favorite of Clutch,"Good album, but definitely my least favorite Clutch CD. I got into Clutch through their later albums and the band is SO much better now than when this CD was recorded. They have really expanded their sound and horizons. So in that respect this CD just doesn't do much for me. When you compare this CD to Blast Tyrant and Pure Rock Fury it just doesn't hold up IMO. But that's a good thing IMO because it shows that this band just keeps getting better and better. On this CD it seems like they get trapped in a particular mood or groove and never really break out of it."
3,heavy groove music,"This album drops the speed of the first album and engages full-time in funky, bluesy loping grooves with more-or-less rapped vocals that occasionally growl or almost sing. Another set of entertaining lyrics helps alleviate the sameyness of these songs. Still a cool band with some cool songs."
3,Amusing for a while,"My wife found an old copy of this book from her childhood, looked through it, and laughed herself silly. Then she did what any sane person would do when finding that they already own something they like: she bought another one.That's right, she bought a second copy of a book she already owned--knowingly and deliberately.It is a clever book. It is pictures of cats (I like cats) dressed up in cat-sized clothes (I like cats in clothes) arranged as a high school yearbook. It is very well done, if only in black and white, but I can only get about halfway through it before I am tired of the whole concept.I can't make it through a 12 page Anne Geddes calender, either."
5,This is a wonderful resource!,"I just finished my Communications class and used this book to give a presentation and write a paper on communication and how to do it right. I felt the book was very educational. It certainly taught me quite a bit, despite the fact that I couldn't really read it (I used it for research). It was on loan from my teacher, but I plan to buy this book for myself. Heck, I'll probably have my husband read it too!"
5,Now here it is,"This one really does it. The samples are perfect and there are some of the most smooth and solid beats on wax. The best of his work for sure. I want to relax and technova are the bomb, as the kids say. If you can catch the video for Technova, it is sweet. Towa is also a top notch graphic designer on top of being a DJ, his visuals are sharp and interesting."
2,Not alot of thought put into execution of this CD.,"I'd describe this CD as having a loungy/Brazilian samba sound overall. While Bebel Gilberto is featured quite a bit on this CD, I think she's better showcased on a pure samba CD. I found this CD to be a bit all-over the place, which is fine, IF it's well-thought out and somehow cohesive. But that was not the case with this CD. In addition to the lounge and samba tracks, two of the songs are very ""pop"" (which doesn't appeal to me), and one song was a horribly failed attempt at a ""global"" sound (track 7). I feel that the artist didn't put enough effort into this CD, and just threw some tracks together without sitting back and reviewing them from a technical/artistic standpoint."
4,Batucada with Bebel Gilberto is tops!,"One of the credits missing from the track listing is that Bebel Gilberto is the vocalist for Batucada. It's a very up track with a serious bass-o-nova sound (think Austin Powers theme). Her very silky, Latin, jazzy voice goes perfectly with the syncopated melody. The lyrics are far from profound, but who cares?See Bebel Gilberto's solo album Tanto Tempo for more of her great voice.This album is worth the price just for this track."
4,Future Classic,A blast from my record store past. This album is very diverse and danceable and has taken his sound further than and Deee-Lite record. A must listen.
4,Excellent amalgam of hot sounds.,"I didn't know what to expect from this former Delight DJ, but I was pleasantly surprised at the very different and quality sounds presented on Future Listening. There's something for everyone on this album, from cool and fresh to easy and sophisticated. I love the album, which I bought not having heard a single review. I was definitely not disappointed and continue to enjoy the album after years of listening."
5,I bot this album a decade ago and I still listen to it all the time,"What a great CD. Very hip. Definitely one of the earliest examples of 1990's lounge music that I am aware of. Some tracks are so good it is unbelievable. There are about 6 tremendous tracks and the other 4 are definitely listenable at worse. You can play this album the whole way thru.What is interesting is I loved this CD for years and I got Bebel's 2nd CD and had no idea that she was on this CD.Anyway, if you somehow found this page and you are interested in it enough to have gotten this far, definitely pick this one up and you won't be disappointed. Definitely one of my top 10 favorite CDs of the 1990s, without hesitation. A no brainer. I remember going to more than one martini bar in SoBe back in 1997 and hearing this playing. It fit the mood so well."
2,DSP book review,This book is mostly composed of formulas and math. It gives little background information on the reasons/motivations for the formulas. I would not recommend this if you are new to digital signal processing.
1,Digital Edition Interface Is Unusable,"Unfortunately the interface for the digital version of this book is very awkward. I purchased the paper version of the book, and has proved to be quite useful. Hopefully the technology behind the web interface for digital books that Amazon employs will improve soon, as this method of accessing reference books makes perfect sense. Currently, however, I would steer away anyone thinking of purchasing a digital book of this kind, who is intending to use the web interface."
2,This is an okay live album,"I just recieved this CD today and it is just okay. It is a live recording, that is obviously not transfered to CD all that well. It sounds a bit like old ""Mono"" recordings that were then changed to ""stereo"" recordings. I know this is terminology dates me, but I state it like I hear it. The song selection is great, but I would only recommend this for the true die hard Bobby fans."
4,Superb NewYorMambo mommi!,Superb example of updated mambo done in the late 90's. Superb musica for a Carribean getaway or a cold Manhattan winter in front of the stereo...which will make you wish you were on a Carribbean getaway! OLE'!
1,"If you're looking for good liturgical prayers, don't get this book!","These so-called ""prayers"" are simply an embarrassment. As the director of liturgy at our parish, I bought this book in confidence of the quality of Liturgical Press materials. After several months of cringing when hearing them at Mass, I pulled it from use. The Liturgical Press should pull it too."
2,Haynes Seca 2 Manual,"There are two major publishers in the motorcycle maintenance handbook market, Haynes and Clymer. After doing some research on the net, I opted for the Haynes. I have since returned it and have ordered the Clymer. The basic problem that I had with the Haynes was that the print was very small. If I'm working on my bike, I want to be able to quickly glance at the manual for information as I'm working on the bike. I didn't think that this would be possible with the small print of the Haynes manual."
3,1st Experience with Guided Imagery - Pleasant,Wasn't sure what to expect...the other reviews helped me with this decision. Thank you all!The intro/format was helpful. The CD is relaxing. A good way to take a break from all the mind chatter with life's fast pace. I didn't have the truly enlightening experience some have had...maybe that comes with time and practice? Still a good investment and a good way to relax for 1/2 hr.!
2,Guided Imagery CD - Soul of Solitude,"I was disappointed in this CD. I was hoping it would be a CD to I would refer to and listen to over and over again. I was wrong. Once I listened to it, I have not wanted to go back over it again."
5,Great Cutters,"This Cutter, like many more I'm using made by Freud, I will not buy any other, now in my shop as I change cutters, blades It's replace with Freud."
3,review of Flight 714,"Not a great Tintin. Not horrible either, since Tintin comics by definition are good. Flight 714 did not contain anything striking, unlike most other Tintins. As a note, this is Tintin's second to last encounter with Rastapopolous. The Lake of Sharks features his last. (Lake of Sharks is the worst Tintin I have ever read.)"
1,Extremely Small,"Since it is called a fruit bowl, I thought it is about 10-12 inches in diameter and should be able to hold several fruits in it. I ordered and sent it to a friend for her birthday. I did not tell her I sent her a gift. Later she called me and said when she first open the box, she did not see anything in the big box. So, she put the box aside. After some days, she noticed my name on the box. She thought I must have shipped something. She digged deep into the big box and at the bottom she found a small bowl. She does not know what it is. She said it is about 5 inches in diameter. I think it is misleading to call it ""fruit bowl"". You should take it off from your website. It damages your company's reputation."
2,Beware of small size,"I love this collection, but thought a fruit bowl would be to serve fruit. It's actually a small portion serving for ONE person - much better for a bowl of cereal..."
3,Smaller than anticipated,"This fruit bowl is very pretty, but it is much smaller than I thought it would be based on the picture. It barely holds 2 apples. I am going to use it as a small candy dish, because no fruit will fit inside of it."
4,These are not too small and are in constant use.,"I've had these shallow bowls for a few years now and they are well worth the money. They are easy to hold and I have used them for single servings of pasta, rice, etc. as well as using it as a coaster for just microwaved Pyrex bowl. I am getting sick of the ivory color and hope to switch to the Royal Albert English Rose version but this is definitely a terrific piece that is useful for children as well as adults. The pattern is not offensive and not ugly as so many of these grandma patterns tend to be. I'm just ready for some stronger colors."
3,SMALL BUT NICE,"I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT WHEN I ORDERED THIS I EXPECTED A LARGE FRUIT BOWL (ARRANGE APPLES, BANANAS ECT.) I DIDN'T EXPECT A LITTLE TINY BOWL. I WAS PLEASED WITH THE SHIPPING - NO BREAKS, CRACKS OR CHIPS. I DO LIKE IT AND USE IT UNDER A PILLER CANDLE. I SHOULD HAVE READ THE SIZE."
1,Appaling,"Bad written, lack of detail, outdated information that deals with 2 decades earlier. Ignorance of current job demands and qualifications."
1,Very poor sonic quality. A joke!!,"The music N Merchant plays is beautiful! But that I knew before I bought this DVD-Audio.The sound is dull, not transparent or detailed nor portrays a wide image. To make matters worse, the 5.1 mix adds nothing to the listening. Most of the mix is geared at the front central speaker. Shame on the engineer who called this an audiophile recording!"
3,Not enough,"There was more musical invention and a little more lyrical range with the Maniacs, I think. There are lovely moments in this CD, but it feels like she ran out of really good ideas--and energy--before the CD was filled up. She sounds like a talented but dispirited person rousing herself to do good things and then sinking back into lassitude or depression."
2,Don't Bother buying it for the 5.1mix,"From the existing reviews I thought this would be a great 5.1 mix, hardly. If you have the stereo version, don't waste your money buying this one. If you have a ""Surround"" setting on your amp, odds are it will sound better. The vocals are non-descript and seem to come from everywhere. The instruments imaging in the stereo version is smeared between the speakers. VERY DISSAPOINTING...save your money!!!!!"
5,Simply Excellant,"Natalie has managed to put together an album that is both musically masterful and lyrically moving. The lyrics to RIver are haunting and beautiful as are the lyrics to Beloved Wife. Ms. Merchant shows her versitility with such catchy jingles as Jealousy and Wonder. Natalie has a unique and wonderfully powerful singing voice that is full of dept and beauty, if Ophelia is even 1/10 as good as this album Merchant will have another masterpiece to add to her long list of acomplishments."
2,DVD-A does not stand up to best-in-class mixes,"This was the first DVD-A I heard and it was a treat. Then I listened to a real DVD-A (Graham Nash's Songs For Survivors, recorded direct to hard disk & mixed straight into DTS). Tigerlily is a great album and the DVD-A is worth hearing, just not critically. If you really want a sit-down listening, get the CD."
3,Pretty good,"She has a wonderful and haunting voice and there are a couple of very nice songs, but most of the songs are a bit too sparse and simple for my taste."
2,Boring and misleading,"This CD is simply boring, with none of the lively pop found on the earlier 10,000 Maniacs CDs. Natalie needs to liven it up a bit and not be quite so self-indulgent.Speaking of self-indulgence, a few of these reviews say that Natalie was friends with River Phoenix, which is why she wrote and recorded ""River."" This is not true--I saw an interview with Natalie where she said she didn't even know him. I think she was just jumping on the bandwagon with this one."
5,The Best!!,I'm listening to this Album as I write. Th best songs on this tape are really hard to single out because I love them all but especially Wonder and San Andraese Fault. She has I voice I love and can never get tierd of.
4,"I love you, Natalie...:)","I bought this CD four years ago and I am still not tired of it. I actually can listen to the WHOLE cd and not skip through songs. LOL. That is a big accomplishment for any artist. I'm a big CD collector...LOL. I buy all types of CDs from dance to alternative to classical. So you can say that I have an open mind when it comes to music. :) I love that one song ""Beloved Wife"", it truly moved me. I only wish that I could find someone that I can tolerate for that many years LOL. :) This is a great CD and not to mention, Natalie has a very unique voice...:)"
4,Some Stand-Out Songs,"I was a devoted fan of 10,000 Maniacs and bought this album with some trepidation, not wanting to lose my love Natalie's voice and carefully crafted songs that were more like stories told by her unique and beautiful voice. I must admit I feel that this doesn't quite reach the level of some of her best work with her former group, but perhaps it is an unfair comparison because it isn't meant to be an album they would have done. Overall the songs are quite good, her voice is lovely, but what really makes the album worthwhile are a few stand-out songs: ""San Andreas Fault"" (more for its evocative and haunting melody than anything else), ""I May Know The Word"", ""Jealousy"", and the gorgeous ""Seven Years"", which I could listen to forever and would never have heard if I hadn't bought the album since it is never played on the radio."
2,"Strong lyrics, weak music","Merchant's lyrics were always one of the Maniacs' greatest strengths, and on this album she shows she still has the kack. But musically, it's a huge dissapointment. The melodies and arrangements sound like cover band clones of classic Maniacs songs, to the point where the songs themselves start to sound like watered down versions of old Maniacs tunes. Very disappointing."
5,sencillamente genial,"Aunque no soy fan de ella, ni de 10.000 Maniacs (me gustan cosas sueltas), este disco es absolutamente una delicia, de principio a fin. Cuantas más veces lo escuchas, más te gusta. Canciones como ""I May know the world"" -con sus ocho minutos-, ""Beloved Wife"", o en general todo el disco, son un conjunto encantador. Para tener en el top ten de nuestra discoteca."
4,Too expensive,You can buy this in .flac digital format 24 bit 98k from HDtracks for $18. You just don't get the silly 5.1 surround sound.
4,"Not bad, Ophelia is much better","If you're torn between which CD to buy my suggestion is to get Ophelia. I purchased it first, and am glad I did. This one has more ""radio play"" but it's just not as good over-all."
3,March 1999,"Ashley PomeroyThings that are Not, in Themselves, Art-Italic text, all in lower-case,any kind of chapter heading that takes the form 'The N-ing' (where 'N' can be 'call', 'gather', 'breath', 'fall', etc), the term 'as one',to be 'of' something,Nathalie Merchant,over-exposed high-contrast images of naked women / women wearing black clothes,black clothes,verbification of nouns, as in 'Woman' ('the power of Woman') or 'Song' ('the power of Song'),the word 'bind'."
1,Boring,"There is nothing wrong with Natalie Merchant's voice, but every song on this CD sounds alike and is incredibly boring. Check out the song samples for yourself."
1,"Natalie's ""well-regarded"" solo career is baffling","I'm glad to read some intensely negative reviews on this release. I concur. I bought both TigerLily and Ophelia after she left 10,000 Maniacs and tried to get into them. Impossible. 10,000 Maniacs was truly a great band. Merchant's voice was an integral part of that greatness but she evidently wasn't the reason that the band was so good. Her replacement, Mary Ramsey, proved the point. The band continued its string of excellent albums without missing a single beat. Merchant wasn't missed at all. I couldn't understand why she left 10,000 Maniacs and started a solo career but I loyally followed her over here. Big mistake. Sandy Denny she's not!I've read elsewhere than 10,000 Maniacs with Mary Ramsey are recording a new album in 2011. I'm very much looking forward to it.As for Merchant, her success as a solo artist is utterly baffling. There is just nothing here worth listening to."
1,Cindy! Please forgive me!,"I bought this CD when it first came out, hated it, and subsequently gave it away to my then girlfriend. Years later now, my Wife will not forgive me for exposing her to this dribble. She fortunately found someone who found it good enough to take it off of her hands without holding a grudge."
5,Wonderful book about this important chapter of the Civil War,"Another book jam-packed with incredible stories from Cottrell and stunning artwork from Thomas. Like Steve Cottrell's other books of the Civil War, it is written perfectly for a wide range of readers to enjoy and learn about many amazing, and largely unknown, accounts of this region during the American Civil War. That, combined with Andy Thomas' incredible illustrations throughout, make for a great read that leaves you amazed about what happened in this country during its greatest struggle."
2,Nice to look at....,"This hummingbird feeder is nice to look at, but it does not serve the purpose. The water just emptys out shortly after filling. We tried everything and couldn't keep the water in."
5,Officer material,"Greatest book for Military Leadership since FM's. Dr. March covers the action with an ingenious blend of operational dialogue and situational awareness that is profoundly captivating. A must read for past, present, and future military officers."
3,durability,I like the Mackie CFX16-mkII; it's user friendly. The one I bought might not be the norm for Mackie; the right channel turns itself off after 15 minutes of operation. It does it every time. Return the product and get another Mackie with 16 inputs.
2,Laziest Kindlization Ever,"This is not a review of the novel, but of the Kindle rendering of the novel.What once spanned 7 volumes and over 3500 pages has been reduced to one huge block of text...with NO table of contents!It's true you can search on individual words or names, but how do you find, say, the first page of the volume ""La Prisonniére""? Apparently there's no way to enter diacritical marks without hacking the Kindle operating system, and searching on ""Prisonniere"" returns no hits, as the search doesn't match ""e"" and ""é"".I would think Amazon would have some standards for the Kindle works they sell but I guess not."
1,Do not buy--chapters missing,"This version is missing a large and important section of the fourth volume. More content may be missing, this is just what I noticed from searching around to find the fifth volume (this version has no table of contents). Do not buy this if you want to read the book."
1,import it yourself!,"You can save yourself about 400 samoleons if you buy this from either Amazon's UK or Amazon's Fr site, even after figuring in the cost of shipping it overseas! Use ISBN-10: 2878625218, ISBN-13: 978-2878625219 to find it there."
2,Think twice about getting this unwieldy edition,"I would think twice before ordering this edition. It took several months to arrive and for some reason I thought I had ordered a set of the books. Instead, I got a big, unwieldy brick of a book with very small type. I've been trying to read it, but a lot of the time I do just as well by going to the Project Gutenberg site and reading the book there (but not all volumes are online yet). One advantage of reading online is the easy ability to look up vocabulary.For the price, it's simply not worth it."
3,"its ok, but spend a little more to get a better one","I've use this torch for a long time, it gets the job done, but I reccomend to spend a couple extra $ to get a better torch.1- doesn't light anymore, so I need a lighter to start it.2 - leaks. so I have to fill it up a little each time I want to use it.3 - top of it fell apart, and most of it is falling apart..4 - the plastic melted..but it is after many years of using it, it was good for the first year.. so it will get the job done.. but just a hassel. It still works which is why I still use it. But if I could go back, I'd rather spend a few extra bucks and get a better one.."
2,waste,this torch worked GREAT for a few weeks but then stopped lighting itself. now i have to use something to light it. you're better off getting a small propane torch from walmart for the same price. i don't recommend it.
3,"If you are serious about bioinformatics, don't get this one.","This book is suitable for those who have never explored bioinformatics and it is quite disorganized. Hence, lecturers need to be able to organize this book for students in a proper way. It doesn't explain algorithms in depth and so if you are algorithmic, get another book. I think this book is too expensive."
2,Good First Draft,"The book has a great table of contents, but it reads more likea first draft than a polished presentation. Many of thetechniques are explained in the same style as the researchpaper they came from, and so the book comes across like a seriesof synopses, which can make it hard to read. I often foundthe explanations unclear -- it didn't read like a book thathad been class tested.Still, I have occasionally found some useful tidbits in thebook, so I gave it two stars rather than one. There's a goodbook buried in here -- hopefully the author will prepare asecond edition."
5,Excellent introduction for biologists,"David Mount did an excellent job introducing bioinformatics to biologists. Without a lot of Mathematics he explains the algorithms used for sequence alignments or phylogenetics, much better than any other book I have seen. Particularly, I found the chapter about Phylogenetic Prediction very helpful, that shows advantages and disadvantages of the numerous phylogenetic analysis programs with a lot of examples and helps the molecular biologist to decide which one to use. Although this book is quiet expensive, I think it is worth every penny!"
1,Needs an Editor,This book has been heavily hyped but the publisher should have put more work into the editing. There is much information here -- a comprehensive set of URL's make the book worthwhile. However I found the book difficult to read -- after analyzing why I realized the author didn't believe in the one concept per paragraph style of writing. Instead he repeatedly attempts to cram too many ideas into too few paragraphs making the book a slow slog.Bioinformatics is hot now and there is a rush to publish -- this book could have used another few months of polishing before going to press.
2,Skips too many details and is hard to read,"This is the required book for our graduate-level computational biology class. I think I represent most of the class when I say the book does a very poor job explaining concepts. There seems to be a pervasive fear of mathematics, which leads to long confusing attempts to explain algorithms by words alone. The writing also seems unnecessarily wordy and opaque. This book also contains many typos, though that may improve in future editions. For some reason, it also costs at least twice as much as most other books on the topic."
4,Only includes 6 cases to solve,"I love this game. It is like playing taboo, pictionary, trivial pursuit, and charades all at the same time with the wide variety of tasks you must complete to solve a case. The downside is that it only comes with 6 cases, so you can only play it 6 times. I hope they sell additional cases."
4,She Came to the Valley,"This book is about the early life of a pioneer family in the Lower Rio Grande Valley in south Texas. Her father was a doctor serving Valley residents. The most interesting facet of the story was the description of life during the early days of the Valley. It also is a tale of her life, loves and experiences as a women in the early 1900's. I heartily recommend reading this book. Although it is no longer in print, it may be found in many libraries."
3,Could have been better,"I was expecting a little more. I think too much time was spent on introduction and very little time on guided imagery. This CD should've been titled, ""Introduction to Guided Imagery"" for those who don't have a clue about guided imagery. But if you already have a clue, then you should try a different CD."
3,Worthwhile but not wonderful,"The imagery in this guided meditation is very powerful. It is well written with three very distinct sections that truly help you to access your inner spirit. However, I found that it was too wordy in sections. Dr. Berlin seemed to want to reassure at every turn and to explain what you may or may not be feeling or experiencing in the meditation. I found these ""side-bars"" to be distracting, especially since the imagery is so wonderful and rich and full. I also found it strange that there was no background music during the guided meditation. It didn't bother me but I think the meditation would have been better with some drumming or flute music."
3,"Good Content, Bad voice","I enjoyed the content of the cd. I like the imagery used to let yourself think you are in a cave, etc. However, I do not like the voice of the person who guides through the imagery. Unfortunately, samples of the cd were not available at the time I purchased it. I would not buy another cd from Dr. Jan Berlin unless it had a differnt voice on it. I would have given it 4 stars, but because of the voice, I gave it 3 stars."
3,Anime' TV Series - Force Five - Danguard Ace,"My least favorite of the Force five cartoons, Danguard is filled with too much dialogue for a giant robot battle series... this VHS is the first couple episodes, and though the series is ok, it gets much better i nthe episodes that follow these."
5,Awesome Force Five cartoon,"Danguard Ace was the first of the Shogun Warrior: Force Five movies that aired in the early 1980's. This was the movie that really hooked me into Japanese robot anime. After this movie, I had to watch any robot anime that i could find. Danguard Ace, Starvengers, and Grandizer were my favorites. Gaiking and Spaceketeers were pretty good. If you love robot anime, than watch this series. This is the series that really started laying the early robot foundation down."
4,Force Five,"A top government agent assembles a force of five martial arts experts to carry out a near-impossible assignment. They must topple the corrupt organization behind one of the world's most wealthy and powerful religious leaders. Starring martial arts champions, Benny ""The Jet"" Urquidez and Richard Norton.AWSOME MOVIE!!!!! :)"
5,Beautiful Neckalce,I just have to say that this necklace is absolutely wonderful. I bought this for my mom for her birthday. It looks great on her and I borrow it often. The shipping was so fast. Thank you very much Harris Michael Jewelery for bringing much joy to my mom on her birthday!
5,"""Oh damn, it's Gibson!""","Yep, that's what I said as a Cubs fan in my youth. Whenever St. Louis was in town and I checked to see who the starting pitcher for the Cardinals would be. Man, did this guy ever break my heart... again and again!Now, in retrospect, I can appreciate his greatness. (Though the painful memories of how he often made my Cubbies look like Little League hitters still lingers a bit). The greatness I admire most today, however, lies not in his pitching talent (superb as it was). Rather, I see his real legacy as one who refused to buckle under to the forces of racism; one who again and again challenged the flawed thinking of both overt racists and even unintentional racists. This book reveals a lot about baseball, but so much more about Gibson the man. He is in the same mold as other great athletes, like Clemente and Ali, who transcended their sport, and made a mark on society as well.But some things are STILL unforgivable -- Why did he have to be so brutal on my Cubbies?!!"
1,I'm sorry,"I hate to be negative but this book was terrible. I am shocked to log on and see such wonderful reviews. This book is very small and has no more information than you can find on the internet. I am a first time Beagle owner and bought this to learn more about the bread, problems and questions I've encountered in my firt weeks of ownership. After reading the whole thing, I came away with nothing new. There is a whole chapter on breeding and a pregnant Beagle but for the average owner, this is not useful. I wish I could return this book it was such a waste of money - and was only a few dollars!"
4,Lots of methodologies for brainstorming,"The book contained a lot of different ideas for mapping out ideas related to a topic, both for individuals and for groups."
1,Very boring book. I could not finish reading it,"This book is boring, uninteresting and uninspiring. I bought it trying to find any idea how I can be creative, but ended up reading lots of unrelated information, studies and justification. I did not even finish reading the book. Its awful!!!!"
2,Dissapointing,"I purchased this book hoping to get new insights into creative methods, but it ended up disappointing me. Perhaps it would be a good read for somebody new to creative thinking and generating ideas, but it didn't provide new insight for me. It could have been shortened to a small pamphlet or magazine article and had just as much utility."
4,The book for creativity...,"A classic.I will give this book 5 stars. This book will spurn so much creativity within you, along with teaching you how to employ it. The exercises for training creativity is great. I highly recommend. I refer to this book all the time and gain so much inspiration. It also gives me a quick refresher course once every so often. A Must have....."
4,Very good content,"This is my 3th book a read about creativity. I really found it very intersting, with good methods, and aldo written in an intersting way.What I really like most y that the research behind this book, has really ponder the most important genious way of creating, so it has a good background and very well supportted."
2,not for designers,"This book may be great for solving bussiness problems, but it is irrelevant to people in creative fields (i.e. graphic designers). I read through tons of unrelated examples of creativity only to discover basic techniques I already use as a designer. This book is for the person who does not access the creative part of the brain on a regular basis."
3,A very irritating and inaccurate book.,"This author likes to reference creative people throughout history (Freud, da Vinci, Darwin, Einstein, Bohr, Feinman, Edison, Tesla, Picasso, and many others). These people would be turning in their graves if they read how the author described their thought processes. His descriptions of their thinking is trite and jaw droppingly oversimplified.All that said, I have to admit I got something out of it. It forced me to sit still and put some ideas on paper and brainstorm. While the vast majority of the exercises were pointless, one or two of them made me think. This book minus many of the author's ridiculous claims could be refined to a good magazine article."
5,Recommended for Everybody!,"This book has changed my perspective about creative thinking and has changed me. I bought this book after a friend recommended it to me over two years ago. I put off reading it because I feared it would turn out to be a re-hash of the same old garbage about creative thinking. I was wrong!!! If I had realized how profoundly I would benefit by putting these creative thinking strategies to work,I would have read the instant I bought it. I recommend this book for teachers, parents, students, bosses, workers, artists, entrepreneurs, leaders etc. In a word: everybody!"
2,Cheap music for a metal compilation release...,I was disappointed when i got this compilation. I was expecting a well put metal collection from the best that metal has to offer but it was far from that. The 1st disc did offer some pretty good music from the death metal scene but from the 2nd to the 6th disc I might as well be listening to Justin Bieber while cutting my veins out and drinking cheap wine. I do not recommend metalheads to buy this collection since it's really a lame and cheap attempt to put together a whole bunch of garagelike grunge music and sell it as metal which is exactly what it's not.
4,Graphic SF Reader,"A lighthearted collection of half a dozen issues of this comics series.Contained therein are parodies of several heroes, including Captain America, the Shadow, the Spirit, and others, as well as a couple of original inventions.So, nothing overly amazing here, but a reasonable number of amusing moments."
4,Great for Beginners,"This is a good book for beginners (me). I did a bit of research on Martin Cheek, he has other books and they are all good choices. Unfortunately his classes are in the UK, a bit of a haul for US residents."
5,PERFECT,My ring arrived in just a few days and is even better quality than I thought it would be. I am very satisfied with my purchase.
4,Nice Ring!,"This is a lovely Ankh ring. Although it is not the typical Ankh (with closed bottom), it is very well-made and attractive. Sterling Silver-good quality."
5,WOW!,"I never heard about this bad until recently, but it truely a unique band and the drummer is now in Glassjaw, and their (Glassjaw's) old drummer is in Walter (Quicksand) new band Rival Schools. Crosshairs are cool."
3,Elita silk magic hi-cut brief,Feels really smooth and silky. Sits a little high in the back and does ride up a little as the crotch area is narrow. I give three stars just because it comes up above most all jeans and pants.
3,Informative but very misleading...,"-The title of the book say's "" Computer Science Resumes and Job-Finding Guide"" but it also says, "" A winning approach for information technology job candidate."" Correct me if I'm wrong, but Computer Science should not be confused with IT. Computer Science deals with R&D;, Inventions, and Development; while IT usually involved in the context of a BUSINESS and is often used to automate manual task...WITIHIN AN ORGANIZATION.-Primary Skills Requirements(based on 2004) mentioned on page 3, contradicts page 31 listings of today's top IT Jobs."
2,Bleh ...,"The sub-title of this books is ""A guide to self-knowledge and spiritual fulfillment through creativity"" ... a more realistic sub-title would have been ""The self-absorbed whining of a mediocre artist trying to fit in as an art therapist""!There are 40 pages of useful information, followed by 160 pages of emo navel-gazing, and pictures of art that looked like they were ""best in class"" for some 3rd grade somewhere.I'm amazed that this has managed to stay in print for 13 years!"
3,Good for Beginners,"Pat Allen gives an informed and moving account of her personal experiences and how art used therapeutically has helped her work through different life challenges. However, being an artist and pursuing the field of art therapy I found her approaches and explanations a bit simplistic and not challenging for those already initiated in the use of art materials and techniques. A section for those with art backgrounds, or a follow-up book, might be helpful in this regard. A good pick for beginners, but not for those already conversant and comfortable with techniques and materials. Her resourse lists are helpful and informative. I would have liked to see works by patients of Ms. Allen's also included, with comments. This might have made the reading more challenging and interesting."
3,"Lots of knowledge, but almost too much","I would recommend it for an art therapy class or if you're definitely interested in techniques related to art therapy, but maybe not so much if you just want something to casually pick up and read. There are a lot of personal references the author makes so it's not so much of a textbook, but she also goes into detail about different ideas for art-making, which I didn't particularly like. She also goes into a lot of detail about her own work career which put me off. However, it did lead me to realize how much I need to get my priorities together and figure out exactly what I'm striving to do career-wise!"
2,Disappointing,"Its a rather poor documentary with insufficient fight scenes: There were only photographs of the Ali v. Foreman fight!! A lot of time is spent on interviews - none with Ali - presumably to give the impression that Ali was created by his trainer or that the owner of his first gym was somehow responsible for his greatness. Buy Ali's Greatest Fights instead. It has 3 separate fights - Liston, Foreman, Frazier (3rd) - with excellent commentary."
3,"Dennis Yost's Last ""Commercial Label"" Album","The only album released on MGM South by Dennis Yost & The Classics IV. Contains his final chart hits ""What Am I Crying For"" & ""Rosanna"" (""My First Day Without Her"" was the final chart entry, but only released as a single on MGM). While the group has made far better albums than this, it's still pretty darn good. And it's the only place to find a great tune called ""Help Me Help Myself"". This LP is a true collector's item as it didn't sell well at all. If you can find one, buy it!"
3,Hey! Let's Make A Movie!...,"DOOM ASYLUM is one of those 80s films that seem like they're being made up as they go along. It's as if those responsible were out driving one day, saw the crumbling ASYLUM of the title, and said, ""I know, let's make a movie!"" We get the spooky, decrepit location, filled w/ goofy characters, stalked by a disfigured killer. The ""script"" is as bare-bones as it could possibly get. Still, it does have enough wacky, mindless charm to make it (just) endurable. Plus, the ""drill-to-the-forehead"" and ""saw-to-the-face"" sequences should keep the gorehundts happy. Kristin Davis (BLACKTOP) and Patty Mullen (FRANKENHOOKER) definitely add to the viewing experience! Worth a watch..."
1,Crap in an Asylum!!,"Perhaps the stupidest movie I have ever had the displeasure of viewing!! If you do not want to punch Mr. Indecisive Blondie in the first 5 minutes you need therapy!! The whole thing is so horribly exaggerated 80's crap, that if you want the cheesiest horror ever, please get it!!"
2,Clinging glowing,"2 1/2Although it would be three more years until her real Debut, this little known release shows Bjork in all of her jazz-lounge vocal glory, highlighting the fairly formal session playing with an already blossoming off-kilter warmth. It is a collaboration that, when not working, really doesn't work, an admirable stumbling block though it may be."
4,In it's own right,"This is a great, often overlooked album full of wonderfully full-hearted playing by some immensely talented musicians. So I imagine 95% of the sales of this album are due to a certain vocalists prescence, but Bjork aside, this is a significant release in the European jazz scene. This is a celebration of the traditional and some gentle boundary-pushing from all involved. a great introduction to Icelandic jazz"
3,It is what it is...,"In response to the review by Laura Laureate, check the date this album was recorded...1990! You can hardly say success had gone to Bjork's head...she was still in the Sugarcubes and relatively unknown back then. She tried something different and then moved on. That being said, it is only essential for true Bjork fans."
4,Good debut,"Adina's first album. Adina is the original artist of ""Freak likeme"" that went to No.1 in the UK with the Sugababes. Her version is much better. Itis much more R&B; and has no guitars , like the Sugababes version has. Thealbum features Michael Speaks and Yo-Yo. Other songs are ""My up and down""and ""You got me humpin"". Adina also sung ""What's love got to do with it""with WarrenG"
4,THERE'S JUST SOMETHING ABOUT ADINA...,"ADINA HOWARD is a very beautiful, attractive, and sensual woman. Her vocals are awesome even though she doesn't really test them on this album. I loved every song, they are all original and show that she's not afraid to be just who she is. I fell in love once I saw her open at a concert for Boys II Men in 7th grade and I've been a huge fan ever since... There's just something about Adina that I love... Can't help it!"
1,Adina I Can Smell That Nasty Rump Over Here,"The fact that Adina Howard is trying super hard to come off persuading her listners that she's a H0, the songs end up sounding so chessy, corny, stupid and repetive. I cant even count how many times she uses the word ""Freak"". The vocabulary here is very limited along with substance which basically there is none. The songs on here are so terrible especially the slow ones that sound like some junk her record label through together the last minute. I think it's funny how she tries to oversing these pathetic songs like they have any meaning or expressive lyrics to them. Adina has a nice voice but she need a serious musical makeover and some guidence. Like someone mentioned, she has stepped over the line and lost her mind."
1,What Can I say,I was disappointed with this CD as with most female singers they don't have more than one good song on their CD's and this one was no exception.
1,Hot??? I Know NOT,"Adina came on the scene with sex,sex,sex, on the brain.She's worst than Madonna( who BTW i consider one of the worst female singers i've ever heard,seen,etc....ATROCIOUS)Anyway,the song Freak Like Me was the only OK song on the album even that song isn't great.People weren't fooled by the sex image and songs hoping that could carry her career far from it didn't.She lacks creativity,the voice,the look,.Her package as a singer or whatever she considers herself is all messed up.She needs to sing about more things besides sex then maybe she could go somewhere."
5,Great product,The long handle shoe horn purchased at Amazon.com is exactly as advertised and a very useful item. It arrived before scheduled date.
5,Shoe horn,"The shoe horn came on time, and in excellent condition. I would definitally buy from this seller again."
2,strange design,"Very good-looking piece, but the spoon is completely backwards, and is convex instead of concave, making me bend into an awkward angle to position it properly. I deal with it, but in retrospect it should have been returned with a big question mark."
2,worked great until,"the plastic horn snapped in two after a few months. For the price, I was hoping for something sturdier. To be fair though, since I can't bend to tie my shoes they need to be pre-tied before they go home."
3,19 inch is better unless you are wearing a tight dress,"I bought both the 19 inch and the 31 inch.I do not know what I was thinking.The 19 inch is just fine.Both work...I just wish I had thought it out...The 31 inch is made solely for a woman standing and can not bend at all.Other than that, the product is okay...thus get the 19 inch unless you are the above mentioned. :)"
1,Waste of money...,"After a Knee replacement that went wrong, I have a knee that won't bend properly...I ordered the shoe horn thinking it would help.. Wrong!The spring makes it very difficult to put my shoe on... it should be more rigid..."
5,Long Shoe Horn,"Very good quality. Flexible horn end is great. Of immense help to me when I couldn't bend over enough to get shoes on. Left shoes loosely tied, so I could just use the horn to slip into them and start walking."
3,installation requires CPU relocation,"Innstallation in my vehicle requried that i remove the engine computer and relocate it. Had i known i probably wouldn;t have ordered it. However, now it is installed and works well. I do think there is better perfomance and milage. A bit more noisy too... cna hear the SC spin. Amaazon had best price by far."
5,Good purchase and good price,These batteries were received in timely manner and in good condition. They are a good price for 40 batteries. They have a good expiration date of 2016 which gives you time to use them. I would recommend them to anyone who needs size 13 batteries.
2,Duracells not very good choice for hearing aids,"Duracell has a poor reputation for hearing aids. They frequently have dead cells in the packets. Other brands are a better choice but harder to find.Bob R, home owner"
5,Her best from 1980-84.,La India De Oriente recorded several fine albums during the first half of the 1980s and this wonderful CD brings us her best songs from her most prolific period. These recordings were all done in the son montuno/conjunto style and feature the legendary SAR Records' house band musicians backing this great songstress up. If you love classic Cuban rhythms you'll love this CD.
5,Theotokos,This is a must if anyone is doing a serious study on Mary.I found it very useful for my dissertation.
3,Not so great.,"I should have gotten a slicker brush, my mistake. This single row of spines stick out straight... I wish they had some curve to them to hook into the hair better.My dog has short hair anyway & this doesn't work on him. I'd recommend this for medium length hair... I don't think it could handle long coats at all. Slicker brushes are the way to go."
5,"Sassy, Single, and Satisfied","This book is awesome. Not finished with it, but it's a book I'll read over and over. I've done it before with other books by the same author."
4,A must reat!,"This is a wonderful book if you are searching for you, and wondering how to succeed in any thing in life;especially where men are involved."
5,GOD WORKS IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS,"IT'S FUNNY, I BOUGHT THIS BOOK FOR A FRIEND, AND ONE DAY I WAS LIKE HEY LET ME READ A COUPLE OF PAGES. IT WAS SO GOOD THAT I HAD TO GO OUT AND BUY ANOTHER COPY FOR HER. IT WAS NICE THAT SHE WAS SERIOUS AND AT THE SAME TIME FUNNY."
4,An awesome perspective,"Great advice for women who want to be closer with God and to find fulfillment in their lives without worrying about “getting a man""! As a single woman who's struggled with these questions for years, I can say that I truly appreciated Hammond's perspective on the subject."
2,Not impressed,If singlehood really was more satisfying than marriage than this book would not be a bestseller. Books about being happy single are just a reflection of how unfulling protacted singlhood is.
1,hanve not receive my book,I am not happy because I have not received my book yet and it have taken so long to received the book. I am not happy with the company and will like to get the book I purchased.
3,Made the mistake of judging the book by its cover...,"The title would lead you to believe that this is a book about being content and satisfied while being single. I found this to not be the case. While there were a few good points made, this is basically yet another wait-for-a-mate book disguised as a satisfied singles' book. This is not necessarily a bad book, I just think the title does not fit the content. I like this author and have highly enjoyed a few of her other books, but this one misses the mark."
2,Not a fan of this one.,Bought it for my lady. She never uses is. I think because it really doesn't keep wine chilled - which is its only function.
4,Celtic? In What Way?,"I could not detect the least celtic slant to the choice of songs or the instrumentation. The selection of tunes consists of Christmas standards. One would expect some emphasis on flute or harp arrangement or at least some bodhran or a fiddle, but it seems like standard orchestra treatment for the songs.I gave it a 4 since it is pleasant enough listening, just not celtic which is what I was looking for.The box says ""made in Canada"" even."
2,Some friend she is,I thought it kinda sound cool when I read about it so I decided to read it. It was ok in the beginning but as I read on the more I disliked it. I know her friend was ok with it in the end but still if I were well I forget her name I would ever talk to Leigh again. I know your saying that their relationship was on the rocks but they didn't have to go behind her back. They should just told her that they had feelings for each other. [...]
2,stupid labels,"I bought these little brackets to support a small shelf I was building.The vendor or the manufacturer, wrapped an adhesive label all around the long arm of the bracket.The label did not peel off in one piece and eventually I soaked them overnight, and then I had to scrub each (I bought 6) one with Goo Gone.I simple SKU label on the back would have been fine.Also, now that I have soaked them in water The joints between the scroll and the angle are rusting.So an hours project is going on to 2 days."
5,Octavio Paz Didn't Explain it All,"I saw this movie originally in Mexico where I lived for years. It had been banned for some time. This movie goes far beyond politics and gives an extremely good insight into the mentality of a national psycosis. There are a good part of the society that does not view the world as such but generally one must be aware and cautious in dealing in Buisness, personal relationships and many other sociological interactions. To many one who takes advantage of another person is considered clever (this is good) and the blame lies on those who allow themselves to be taken advantage of. This is the only country in Latin America where Hijo de la chin#%$#@ is the worst insult. The realization of this among many in Mexico has made them question whether not only how this attitude has affected their politics but also their commercial and personal relationships."
3,I was excited about this game but my kid doesn't like it.,My first grade son loves his Leapster and every other cartridge that he owns but he just doesn't like this one. I was hoping that Math Baseball would be a fun way for him to practice his beginning math skills but it hasn't turned out that way. The way the rules are re-explained is annoying for both him and me and even when you answer a problem correctly it doesn't insure that you won't hit a pop up that is caught or pitch a ball that gets hit. I guess thats the way the real world works but my son found it disillusioning and it only further contributed to his lack of interest in this game. My kid loves to learn. He loves to read. He loves to draw. We make up math games at home. I am always looking for a way to keep him stimulated but also encourage him to have a little fun. This game just didn't do it for him.
5,what an ensemble,"Excellent music, love the venue, great sound and what a set of musicians. Can you imagine Bonnie Raitt singing background! Roy's voice is so sweet. This takes me back a few years and I love it."
5,Black & White Night,This is actually the second copy I purchased. I left the first at a rental while on vacation. Great price and super product.
3,If You Like Live Performances...,"this may be the CD for you! I watched the special on PBS and bought the CD on the basis of that. For me, the video version was better than the CD version. I found myself wanting to hear the original or album version, rather than live songs. However, many will be attracted to the mystique of having legendary music greats such as Bruce Springsteen, Bonnie Raitt, and others as the back-up band on this CD."
4,Best of the best,"If you like Roy Oribson, this is the CD for you. All of his hits played by him and some of the most renowned musicians in the world. This is by far the best recording of Orbison's hits. This is a great CD to add to anyone's collection."
5,THIS IS MY FAVORITE CD!!,"I bought this CD after seeing the live show on the TV on the PBS channel..I had never known much about Roy but this tape was so great because it has so many guest artists playing on it..I used Amazon because they have the best prices and I have never been disappointed with any of their CD's or the service they give..This CD is great, but if you're searching for it under the title looking for his guest performers CD beware....Someone else was selling it for nearly $60 and I got this from Amazon for only $6...If you like Roy Orbison, this is a great one to get.."
5,THE ESSENTIAL ROY ORBISON,THERE IS NO ONE GREATER THAN ROY ORBISON AND THIS IS ONE OF HIS BEST CD'S. IT IS PRICED REASONABLY AND THE SHIPPING IS FAST AND REASONABLE.
1,"this is a ""bad"" supplier. should not be with amazon.","goods not delivered in 3 weeks. other suppliers on the same order delivered in 3 days? What's up? Where is my CD? Amazon needs to get rid of bad suppliers, before we get rid of amazon. Ken B"
5,excellent music,great singer. It has two instrumentals that are great beat and guitar playing. I saw this cd in action on public televison and knew right away I had to have a copy
5,How many greats can you put on one stage?,"WOW. Although I will admit to being a bit disappointed at the video quality, the audio, of course, is what this is all about. Tremendous group of talents. I enjoyed seeing the 1988 versions of k.d. lang and other artists who have since made their way to the very top of their craft. And by the way, whatever happened to Jennifer Warnes? Wonderful singer."
5,Black & White Night... WOW!,"I have played this continuously since I got it. Heard it first years ago, when I got the DVD, but wanted to just hear the music. It is awesome!"
4,Prevention Fitness System: Drop It in 30,This was a pretty good workout. The 2nd workout was much more strenuous.
3,I am a Preveintion fan and did find this a good .....,"exercise DVD I would not say her cues are on the money. The warm up is OK I will agree that more attention should be put on warming up the legs. The two workout themselves are a very good calorie burn and it does go by fast. This is choreographed to build the routines, which is very nice.My biggest complaint is her cool down it has to be one of the worst I have ever done. I just do my own to get every muscle group I just worked with her."
4,Doesn't seem difficult but burns those calories!,"I bought this video because I needed a change from my Reebok step tapes, and I'm impressed! I never would have believed that I would burn as many calories ""on the ground"" as on my step. Plus, it's easier on the knees.I am 62 and have been doing aerobics for years. I also use hand weights and an exertube. Recently I read that it was more efficient to work out alternating between hard and easier periods, which my old tapes didn't utilize.I wear a heart-rate monitor and stay within my fat-burning range and this DVD works great. Some reviewers said it was too hard in some places, but it's easy enough to follow the low impact person on screen. You have to taylor this stuff to your needs. The monitor really helps with that and I'd recommend it to anyone beginning an aerobic program so they can stay in their range. It's more efficient. The music could be better, but hey, can't have everything!"
5,WONDERFUL WORKOUT!!!!!!!,This is a great workout! I absolutely love it! I have wasted my money on several different workout dvds in the past month and I have finally found the one! Chris Freytag keeps you motivated to the end. I can't wait to get her other workouts. I expect they will be as wonderful as this one!
3,good motivator,"This was a video with excellent cueing. Time went by quickly with the athletic drills, but kind of boring with the routine(add-on) segment. Very upbeat instructor."
2,An agility experiment,"If you're a professional dancer/trainer, or if you just like watching the results of weeks of rehearsal, get this video. However, if you actually want to DO a video workout, I'd steer clear of this one. The verbal ""heads up"" for step changes nearly always come after the move has commenced, and while a step is repeated 4-8 times the first go-round, the instructor quickly moves on to a lengthy combination of 8-10 steps that will leave all but the most dedicated fitness fanatic in the dust. Beginners and intermediates need not waste their time...unless they prefer their fitness videos for entertainment value only. This production will take many run throughs before you can even begin to keep up, and by then you'll be regretting having doled out the cash for it."
2,Poorly designed,"This is really a very basic beginner workout but it has design flaws. The instructor's energy is great but cuing is late, and doesn't often include anything about your form until later in the program. Almost all her cues are about breathing. No cuing about protecting your knees or back and reminders for people exercising on carpet...home video no-no. The moves are basic and nice because they are dance alternatives to the standard aerobic moves BUT she puts them together wrong. The sequence causes you to go from a moderate intensity move to a series of very low-intensity moves for awhile and back. You never break a sweat and the jumps in intensity don't make sense. Very disappointing program."
1,poor routine,The routine is strange and does not flow. There are lunges with twisting which caused me to injure my knee. Her moves are not flowing and very awkward. I did not like this at all.
4,Chris Fretag style,"I think you either like Chris Fretag's teaching style or you do not. Personally, I really like her. She isn't cheesy. She isn't boring. She is right in the middle for me.I really liked this workout's high energy routines. The main part of the workout is 20 minutes. That is VERY easy to squeeze into a day. Like some of the reviewers mentioned, there are numerous twists and turns. There is no floor workouts in the DVD.I have numerous Freytag workouts. I did find this ones timing to be not as clear as her other workouts. (thus the four starts) That being said, it is still a very complete short burst workout.I will purchase more of her workouts in the future."
4,Great Mix,"I always enjoy the workouts that Prevention puts together - there's so much variety that you will certainly not get bored. Your heartrate will be up, but I was never gasping for breath (which is good!) Chris definitely has a cheerful personality that isn't overwhelming. She's encoraging, motivating, and makes you hit all the areas of your body. If your looking something that really intense, this video isn't it, but I still feel it's a decent workout. And it's broken up into seperate segments, so if you are crunched for time you can just do what your in the mood for."
1,disappointed,"Bersteins ""Against The Gods"" was a well written summary of the history of risk, then migrated to current relevancy of risk management thorugh probability and statistics. However, I found this book to be a promotion of name, a perspective of liberal economic philosophy, wordy, and to me presents a biased opinion. I would not recommend this book, but suggesten enrolling in a few hours of economics at a local university."
5,This is a Great Tofu Book,I've made a few things out of this book and I'd recommend it to anyone who finds tofu a bland product. The recipes are different and tasty.
5,Excellent,"Louise Hagler's books are excellent. I've been using her recipe books over the last 20 years. The recipes are always down to earth and very easy to prepare. Some vegetarian recipe books are too ""gourmet"" or ""exotic"" for my family's tastes. These recipes are great for every day of the week and the ingredients don't have to be purchased at a specialty store, just your neighborhood grocery store. My other favorite book by Louise is ""The Farm Vegetarian Cookbook""."
3,So-So Soy,"While this book has many lovely photographs, I have found that the pictures look better than the food tastes. The results are often very disappointing, both in appearance and taste. I appreciate that the exotic ingredients are kept to a minimum, but the instructions are often unclear."
1,tofu cookery,"i find it difficult to purchase your cookbooks, mostly because i do not know what they contain. a bigger picture(hero)does not give me any indication of what is offers. the reviews are great but i would like to know what's between the covers, if it new and inspiring or is it the same recipes that have been revised or just reprinted?"
5,Tofu,"MMMMM... I love tofu. This book was great. I enjoyed learning new ways to prepare tofu. I had never thought of making meatloaf tofu, but it was really good. Good ideas!"
1,Can't get it to stick to the car,"I followed the instructions provided and wiped down the attachment area with rubbing alcohol, but was still unable to get the connectors to stick to my car. I finally resorted to spot-sanding where the sticky bits were supposed to go but it still wouldn't stick. Sending it back for a refund. And kicking myself for sanding spots of my cars interior in order to try to make this work."
1,wish i had seen the reviews,not what i was hoping for. worked for a week and fasteners came apart. very hard to uninstall too
4,Better than reviews suggest,"Then again...I was using this as a cat barrier and not as a dog barrier. I agree with the other reviews that if a dog paws at this barrier, that it will come down, but I was driving cross country with my long haired mainecoon persian cat, and it did exactly what I needed it to do...keep the cat in the hatch. I tied the lower corners to the back seat anchors to keep the corners tight enough and so Leo couldn't crawl through, and the Velcro stayed put just fine (and I didn't alcohol swab first)."
2,What a piece of crap!,"I read all the bad reviews and still bought this products. Fail! I should have listened and saved my money. Like everyone else said, the adhesive anchors are a joke. I cleaned and warmed up the surface as instructed and still they only held for 10 seconds before falling off. I even used some industrial strength glue my husband stole from his job and even that didn't hold it. So I rigged the net by tying it to some anchors that were already there, including the back seat belt, and even slipping the string under some molding in the car. It works, barely, but looks horrible. I was so pissed off I almost considered using a staple gun on the interior of my car. Don't waste your money and just buy the metal one. Besides, this one is ridiculously overpriced. Boo!"
2,Needs different fastening system,"This pet barrier is a descent product overall. It just has issues with the fasteners falling off. While it was in place it kept my two large labs separated from the rest of the vehicle as described. However, after only a day or so it falls down. I followed the instructions to a t, cleaning the vinyl surface with rubbing alcohol to prep the area to mount the Velcro like anchors. I am still trying to find something to anchor the barrier to the car with. So at this time I can't even use the gate until I can find something to keep it up with. disappointed. Good luck keeping this thing in place."
2,Worked acceptably until time to remove,"Bought to drive uneasy car dog on 1800 mile trip. Worked as well as can be expected and I intended to keep it but when I went to remove it the anchor points (small nylon rope attached to monster plastic ""velcro"") detached.Returned to Amazon on 32nd day (minus 8.00 return after 30 day fee)"
1,Does not keep dog from roaming,"My dog figured out easily that she could move this product with her nose and be in the back seat. She was also able to pull on it and dislodge the adhesive velcro stripes from the vehicle sides. In a last effort to show me her displeasure for the barrier, she pulled it down, ate the string shoelace attachments off of it and ripped the screen up with her paws. I'm now looking into metal varieties."
1,"Used as directed, did not work as advertised","The net itself looked fine and seemed like it would suit our needs. I installed the net exactly as directed; I even cleaned extra times the areas where the adhesives would stick to our car, and didn't add the net for several days afterwards -- just to ensure they'd stick. In less than 24 hours after attaching the net, however, all but one or two (of six) adhesives fell off.The product was returned."
5,Dog barrier,"This was so easy to install. I just tied it to the rear head rest posts. Though I have twobig labs, this was enough to keep them contained in rear of Honda CRV. Visibility is great,no bars blocking view and can fold down rear seat without removing. Great item at a good price."
4,Pretty Good,"I was pleased with everything about this exept the velcro adhesive for the wall of the car. It may just be that it's a hot summer, but they wouldn't stay stuck at all. I went and got $2 worth of velcro strips though, and that did the trick."
2,Great Idea Poor Assembly,"I followed the instructions to a T when this item arrived, cleaned the mounting pad surface, adhered the pads per the instructions, waited two days not one to allow the adhesive to cure, mounted the unit adjusted the tension and thought everything was good to go. The next morning I went into the garage and found two of the pads had pulled off of the pillar. The design crew needs to go back to the drawing board on this one. I gave it two stars only because of the fit when first installed."
3,won't stay stuck,"the product is a great idea, especially for keeping the dog hair in the back seat from blowing all around my car. however, the velcro pieces won't stay stuck to my car- when the car gets hot they pull right off. i followed the directions to a T, cleaning the plastic pillar 3 times with alcohol and allowing it to dry completely and waiting 24 hours before applying the stickers. very bummed!"
4,Easy to use,I have received this item 2 weeks ago.First installation was challenging but then it is easy to use.It is not good for big dogs.
2,Solvit Pet Barrier,Not really a functional product for our use. The fasteners lack functionality as well.
4,"Great writing, lacking story","I loved the writing style in this book, and the characters were well-defined and well-written, but the story line was forseeable. We all knew it was coming. Alas."
4,For my Girls,"Leah Stewart really captured the true friendship of young girls and women. At times we are inseparable and disconnected at others.It made me think about my connection with my girls.And how we can not like one another one minute, but love each other so much. I recommend The Myth of You and Me. True friends are hard to find and when you have them cherish them........"
2,Left me cold,"I felt the premise had merit but the characters lacked enough depth to pull it off. And that Oliver in the end wasn't really Oliver made no sense in the whole scheme of the story. The only reason I finished the book was to see what was in the package Cameron had been carting all over the place. Even that was a disappointment.Linda C. WrightAuthor, One Clown ShortOne Clown Short"
2,shallow and ordinary,"I hung on to the characters Sonia and Cameron only to conclude they are common along with the plot. I guess the author was trying to convey that the big Cameron (over six feet) was really spineless and that Sonia was a faith complete according to her mom's predictions of her,Their friendship ends over a guy, Btw, you read that over 3/4 of the way into the book, Surprise! and so what.The character of Mr. Ducet was appreciated, It began the novel nicely but he died too quickly and the rest was uneventful for the reader and the wayward friendship. I pushed myself to read and get to the end waiting for some revelation that never happened or is it that loneliness is a choice. No big deal or no great read."
4,Talented writer,"This is the story of Cameron, who used to be best friends with Sonia, but has lost touch following a fall out, the reason of which we don't know. Cameron lives with and works for a 92 year old historian, and following his death, Cameron sets out to find Sonia. Her journey takes her through the life of a Sonia she no longer knows, and Cameron finds out about herself as much as about her old friend.Leah Stewart is a talented writer, who manages to give depth and feelings to her characters. Recommended."
3,Unsatisfied,"This is an interesting story of a long-time friendship that appears to fall apart because of betrayal and dishonesty. There were times in reading this novel where I identified with the narrator, but, then again, parts of the story just didn't seem r"
2,The Myth of You and Me,"I was forced to read this book as it was selected by my Book Club. Parts of it were interesting, but for the most part it was a real ""sleeping pill""."
4,An honest story showcases the complicated nature of friendship and love,"The main character of this book, Cameron, is content in her job working for Oliver, a famous historian--content to forget about the past and to avoid focusing on the future. But when Oliver suddenly dies, Cameron is forced to deal with both her past and future as she sets out on a mission to find her former best friend, Sonia, to whom she hasn't spoken for 8 years; over the course of Cameron's journey, she comes to question everything she knows about honesty, friendship, and love.I found this book to be very enjoyable: the author successfully wove past scenes of Cameron and Sonia's friendship with Cameron's present-day efforts to track Sonia down, the characters were realistically flawed, giving the story a very ""real"" feel, and there was even a build-up of suspense as the inevitable reunion between Cameron and Sonia approached. I enjoyed this book very much and rate it four-and-a-half out of five stars."
5,Read It,This is a story about the people who enter and leave your life. It was a great read. Dont miss this one.
3,"Reflective book, not a ""must read""","This is the tale of a friendship that went south...maybe a little west. Although the story is engaging, I found the characters to be very predictable and unexciting. I am amazed at how many people loved the story, so Leah Stewart must have found a sensitive spot for many readers. The story does have a surprising twist at the end but it is not worth taking the time to get there. The redeeming quality of this book is the tender presentation of the friendship while it lasted. I was disappointed over the reason that the friendship ended, I wish Cameron could have been more forgiving. Maybe that's something you can take from the book, is the loss of a best friend worth harboring unforgivenes and being lonely for eight years?"
1,Why is this book so popular?,"I bought this book for a book club meeting hoping that this would be the one that would encourage me to stay with the group. (Now sure it worked, but we did have a lively discussion on the value of friendship). We spent very little time talking about the book however, because there is not much there. This is not a book for adults - it belongs in the ""Teen Angst"" section of the library. The main character is stuck in perpetual high school mode.A character, like Cameron, who lets us know from the beginning that she is a good liar is just not believable when she goes off the rails after discovering that people have (shock!)lied to her. Her punisment of Sonia (her supposed best friend) is out of all proportion to Sonia's ""crime.""Leah Stewart does know how to put words together - many of her passages are quite beautiful. She has talent that is, unfortunately, wasted in chick-lit fluff."
4,Quick read,"Entertaining but heartwrenching, funny and sad, this book was written in a very lovely way. Anyone who has loved and lost a friend will appreciate this book. It was hard to put down."
4,Thought-provoking light-reading,"Leah Stewart has created a very touching book about the power of love and loss. It is not just a story of friendship, but a story about what binds people together and what happens when that bind breaks. Cameron and Sonia, the main characters, are well-developed, believable characters - flawed though they may be (who says protagonists have to be perfect?). We are pulled into their friendship through a series of flashbacks all closely weaved into a current story of what becomes of them without each other.This is the kind of book you can pick up and read in an afternoon or during a couple of your children's naptimes. It is light-reading, but not fluffy. It is a wonderful choice for a book group - especially during the summer months. There is plenty to discuss."
5,Great book,"I thought this was an excellent book. I could really relate because I recently ended a 13 year friendship that I thought would never end but did. The characters were great, and I just loved the story. When I finished I actually read the last page 3 times. I didn't want it to end. I am very happy I read this book."
5,Myth of You & Me by Leah Stewart,This product was received on time in great condition. It will be a great addition to our library collection.
4,Good but not memorable,"I finished this book last week and liked it. It was a quick read because once you finish it, you will never think about it again. It's like a lifetime movie that you just can't seem to look away from. You just want to find out what happens."
5,great book- sticks with you,"I read a lot of books and unfortunately, many are enjoyable but are not memorable enough for me to really remember them. (I've picked up books and feel deja vu in the first chapter- usually signally I've read it before.) So, when you remember a story years later, it's usually because it was pretty good.I picked up this as an audio book at the library a few years ago- a lot of commuting in the car. If I had known it was so good, I would have preferred to read it first.Such a great book, had me riveted to the story. I immediately told my sister to read the book and she really enjoyed it too."
4,Thought Provoking and Intelligent Chick-lit,"Cameron and Sonia have been best friends since Cameron moved to Clovis, New Mexico in high school. They shared secrets, and even attended the same college. After college, they had a cataclysmic falling out, the circumstances of which are not revealed until halfway through the book. Sonia writes to Cameron when they are in their late twenties, and the story evolves from there. The author examines the nature of female friendship, and the reader is forced to reflect on what, if anything, is unforgivable, and if trust is ever possible. A page-turner, this novel proves that thought provoking and intelligent chick-lit is not an oxymoron."
4,memory lane,"This was a book that I didn't want to put down. When I did have to, I was wondering what Cameron was going to come across, or remember, next. Many of the things they encountered in their frindship, I would remember about my own ""best friend"" relationships. So not only did I get to enjoy reading this story, but I also was able to enjoy some of my own memories that the book brought to mind, and re-examine some the things that have happened over the years to change my own friendships."
4,KInd of disappointed with the ending,"To me, getting to the end of this book was actually better then the ending itself. I liked how she would switch between the present and the past, and it also brought of memories of my adolescence, but the ending was just kind of ""blah"" compared to the trip there. I will, however, read another book by this author."
5,"Sepphoris, Forgotten City Rediscovered","This is amazing information about a huge city of Sepphoris only 4 miles from Nazareth in the time that Jesus grew up there! The excavation photos are very revealing of the importance of this city, the second largest. Many of Jesus sayings indicate that he was aware of city life and no doubt the carpenter shop was kept busy making items for the city. I was first attracted to this book because orf the artist drawings, a great enhancement. It's a book not to miss and would be terrific in every church library as well.Thanks Amazon"
2,I can't believe this album is rated so highly...,"Bought this disc hoping for some solid alt rock; knew I was in trouble when I cracked the cover and the lead singer was staring at me with his shaved chest and open vest straight out of Billy Idol's closet. The weak-sauce tunes just reaffirmed my initial impression - overly sappy lyrics combined with a limp rhythm section just about killed the album by track five, but I kept waiting for it to get better. Whoever compared these chumps to Nickelback is either tone deaf or just hates Canadians. And that song ""Get In Get Out""? Dimebag Darrell is rolling in his grave knowing that one of his best riffs (from ""I'm Broken"") has been stolen by these poseurs.The two stars? One for actually getting a record contract, the other for the one actually catchy song on the disc (Should've Known Better)."
2,What a Gyp,"It ws great to get such a nostalgic collection. But the whole thing looked like a boot-leg, and there were no inserts, OR the advertised poster in mine. I exchanged mine for another, and the new one had the same problem! You get what you pay for."
5,Oh wow! Nostalgia Wave Approaching!,"Well, I'm a sixteen year old guy and I'm not afraid to say I love this show. Most people look at me like I'm crazy when I say this, along with some form of ""Are you gay?"" Well, no, I'm not. And If you've ever seen this show, you would know that it is one of the funniest, smartest, action packed, and all around great cartoons of all time. Yeah, no exaggeration. When i was a lad watching Cartoon Network, this, Dexter's Lab, Courage the Cowardly Dog, and Scooby Doo Where Are You practically raised me. Shame none of those have a DVD set. But hey, pick your battles I guess. And The Powerpuff Girls is quite a victory in itself! Great show, great buy. Highly recommended."
5,Power Puff Girls dvd set 10th anniversary,This was a gift for my daughter and she was very happy with them! No problems that I've heard about!
5,Classic!,"I bought this for my son, who has always loved the Powerpuff girls. A great buy for a hard to find product, it's the entire series, very satisfied."
2,"BOX SET INCOMPLETE, missing items","BUYERS BEWARE!!! The dvd inserts in the box set were missing. The inserts that tell you the episode titles of the dvd's. These are the same inserts that when put together are supposed to make the poster. I thought maybe it was just the set I received so I exchanged it. But the second set I got was still missing the inserts and there was a deep scratch on one of the dvd's that prevented it from playing. I returned this set as well. This is just ridiculous that these dvds are even being sold without the inserts that are clearly on the product pictures. Others have complained about this same issue. I was very dissatisfied and have decided to try purchasing this from somewhere else. Needless to say, my daughter was very disappointed."
5,10 years.... Has it been really that long?,"I am so looking foreward to this.The Powerpuff Girls has to be by far, the most popular series The Cartoon Network ever aired. It is still extremely popular today, due to it's overall creative writing, old school animation, and the extreme cuteness of it's three main characters, wich need no mention here.Who would have thought that Craig Mc Cracken's short student film would have spawned two pilots, (Meat Fuzzy Lumpkins and Crime 101), six seasons worth of 7 minute shorts, one theatrical movie, and a Japanese Anime, let alone an entire fanfiction industry that continues to thrive.The Powerpuff Girls is one of those rare tv shows that will never die, due to it's hardcore fans, and the new fans that will discover it down the road. The animation is far from Disneyesque, but it's sheer fun, pop culture status, and entertainmentvalue will make it a fan favorite for decades to come."
5,Powerpuff Girls,The 10th Anniversary Collection of the Powerpuff Girls was delivered promptly and in excellent condition. I was highly satisfied by the service and quality
4,PowerPuff Girls,"Videos are have great playback quality and include all of the episodes, but there is no labeling or design on the disks themselves, so it is confusing to tell which side is which (-1 star). Don't expect any bonus cartoons to be included with these disks like the ones available for sale or rent in retail stores. Courage The Cowardly Dog, Sheep In The Big City are nowhere to be found on these DVDs (-1/2 star)."
5,must have dvd set,my powerpuff dvd set came fast and safe good packing job! thanks! now i can watch my favorite episodes and one i missed!
2,Soil Builder Liquid Copncentrate,Even thought it was easy to mix and spread I saw no results. Even after it had rained you would have thought that the grass would have picked up a little.I would not recommend this jjproduct.
5,Still one of the best out there,I purchased the early model of this TV 2 years ago. I still love it! There is something that I recently found out and I would like someone to clarify this for me: I use my TV to play XBox games and they look wonderful! Until I bought Soul Calibur II. This particular game is the first one that is 720p capable. This game will NOT play in my TV at that resolution. I tried switching the XBox resolution back to 480p and it works fine. I called Microsoft to check if it was a problem that they were aware of and they said that I was the first to report it.If anyone has more info on this I would like to know if the TV can play 720p or if the problem is in the XBox....
3,"RCA F38310 38"" Review","Very nice picture, but the fan that constantly runs is a major negative (especially in the bedroom)."
4,"A few flaws, but a great value","First of all, having the flexibility of a built-in HDTV tuner, DirecTV tuner, and more inputs than you can shake a stick at is really great. With a good signal, the picture is darn good. Not up to Sony quality, maybe, but pretty good. The speakers are about what you would expect; I imagine most people willing to plunk down the dough for one of these will have a receiver around and run the sound through it. Highly recommended. DVDs look great, and you can adjust the aspect ratio easily from the remote (press the fast-foward button). Downsides: screen is not flat, and it is sensitive to noise/interference. A bit of dot-crawl is noticeable as well. User interface takes a little getting used to. Having 16:9 for DVD movies, rocks, however. Think carefully about where you are going to put it; it weighs 215 pounds! Making a slide out tray for it in my entertainment center was a major engineering feat.For the money, if you want HDTV and a tube screen, this is hard to beat."
5,I GUESS I'M ONE OF THE LUCKY ONES,"I purchased this TV in August of 2002 and as of this day I have not had a problem with it. What is fustrating is when I moved and DirectTV sent one of their ""contractors"" out to install the TIVO DVR, they did not understand that the TV had a buitl in reciever. I had to explain this to two different techs. I am now looking for a newer modle with a built in reciever, but can't seem to find one with a slot for a DirecTV card. If anyone can help, drop me an email it would be appreciated."
1,Bad OOBE,"Day 1. After wrestling this monster indoors & out of the box it really disappointed me. When I plugged in the AC cord I heard the 'chirp' of the high voltage power supply and the whirr of a fan. Pressing the power button changed nothing. There's no initial setup screen, no blue screen, no snow, nada, zip, nothing. The troubleshooting index suggests removing power & trying again in 5 minutes. No good. I've removed power & placed a fan near the vents in case condensation formed when the unit came in from its 50 degree Farenheit journey from Circuit City. We'll see where this goes."
4,Excellent HDTV Value,"Great overall performance, great picture, I have had it for 2-years without any problems. Only weakness is no video outputs jacks(what were they thinking?) and only one HD RGB input,"
1,Dont buy this TV,"...It's now been at the service center for two months -twice as long as I actually got to use it. DON'T BUT IT - NOT WORTH THE HASSLE.I bought this TV a month ago and it seems to be the worst consumer electronics decision I've ever made.Initially it worked fine (over the air). When I had a Direct TV dish installed,it became apparent that the inbuilt direct tv tuner didn't work. The RCA recommendend repairer came and collected it and determined there was also a problem with the picture tube...My advice - choose a TV with better warranty support"
4,I'm intrested,I'm thinking about this TV. But I don't remember it on the shelves of the stores or on the web. Please...somone tell me about it.
4,still thinking,which one ? looking at rca 38 in or panasonic 47in projection widescreen swaying towards rca mostly for built in hdtv also like clarity of tube tv. price pretty much evens out more tv with projection but which one?
4,Great for the money but a few flaws.,"I purchased TV. in Dec 2001 And I like 75% of the reviewers had a problem which needed to be repaired. Thankfully the tech repaired it in house and from the symptons I told him he new the trouble before he opened the TV. He had seen the same trbl before 2 capacitors were bad in the power supply.Yes the fan runs 24/7 and it bothered me at first but now I dont even notice it. No video output to record directv channels, speakers sound bad at high volumes when watching certain shows, The local channels dont look as sharp as on an analog tv.But on the plus side The picture with HDTV or DVD is phenominal, It is the largest widescreen direct view on the market. And it is cheaper then most 34"" widescreen. It has HDTV tuner and sat tuner built in."
2,"Looks nice initially, but later....","I bought this television 4 months ago. All the methods suggested by RCA to get the TV to work were tried but nothing worked. Finally a RCA-approved local technician checked it and found that a component in the power supply board was bad. After this, a video converter board was found to be bad. I am going to cut my losses and sell this TV now and buy something else. If you scan the reviews here at Amazon and other sites, you will see that RCA/Thompson products have a much higher component failure rate than similar products made by Sony, Panasonic, JVC, etc. You pay a little less for RCA up front, but are taking a high risk later with repair bills and headaches. Think about it before you buy."
4,Almost perfect Weber S-650,"The Weber S-650 is the best grill I've owned. It is the third weber I've purchased. My last weber is 18years old. Weber's quality and parts support has been the best. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the decal, for the lighting and propane instructions, on the inside of the lefthand door, is on upsidedown."
5,I really like this grill!,"This is my third gas grill and by far the best. It really seems built to last and passes the shake test with fying colors as mentioned before. It gets hot very quickly and gives your meat those nice sear lines, the smoker works well, as do those neat grill out handle lights. Packaging was very good, set up is very simple basically remove the grill from carton (takes 2 people as it is very heavy) install the side shelves, flavorizer bars, cooking grates, grease trap and hook up your lp tank and your ready to grill.Overall I would highly recommend this grill even with the hefty price tag. For me it is a long term investment and is well worth it."
3,Cooks well but construction lacks,"Grill arrived with bent front doors. Weber customer service was great on the phone. New doors arrived, missing the magnetic clasp and interior instruction sticker and themselves slightly bent. In removing the old doors, I saw rust streaks underneath, which didn't make me feel very confident in the durability of this grill.The back and sides are painted, not stainless, so you'll probably want to place it against a wall. The base bends easily on uneven surfaces. The casters are lame. But in the end it cooks well. All the business parts, the grate, burners, etc., work nicely and it can definitely crank out the BTU's."
3,Leaks water into grease pan,"I have the Weber summit 670 - great for cooking, but very poorly designed. If the grill is not covered, it will leak water into the grease pan and fill it up in one day. If there's grease in it, it too will leak all over your deck, or wherever it is. I specifically avoided the Kenmore because of this issue, and WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT THE WEBER if I knew this was going to be a problem. For the money this costs, it should not leak like this. Weber was very defensive about their faulty design, and said I should remove the grease pan after each grilling, and place it on the cooking surface so the water can run right through - nice."
1,disgusting gease pan water leaks design flaw,"I purchased the nearly same s-670 grill as a replacement for an older weber and returned it as defective. the replacement also was flawed and was taken back. There is a serious disgusting design flaw on this model. there is a large gap all along the attachment of the grill to the cart that leaves a one inch opening around it. In ANY rain storm water leaks in here, runs down the grease trap catcher and fills the grease pan that sits in the cabinet. In a short time your entire cabinet fills with a flood of rotting greasy overflow and water destroying anything inside. Weber claims to know nothing of this and asked for photos to analyze but if you search on line for this problem you will see many many people have had it and demanded refunds from weber. Their only answer is to leave the grill covered at all times when not in use-- this is just unacceptable for a $2000 grill. Beware!"
2,Summit Line Problem,"I have a Weber Summit S-420, but my comments are applicable to the entire Summit line. Whenever it rains, water flows down the back and enters the internal drip tray, which the flows into a drip pan. The pan overflows creating a greasy mess inside the cabinet. The problem occurs with and without the Weber cover in-place. Weber does not consider this to be an issue!!! I give the grill a 2 star rating because it does do a nice job of cooking - once the mess is cleaned up."
1,Horrible singing and playing on the CD,"I had only a short look at the book itself and it appears to me to be OK (say 3 stars worth). When I bought the book during holiday, I alas have not had the opportunity to listen to the accompanying CD - a grave mistake and the reason for the ONE STAR.Both the singing and the guitar(s) playing are truly repulsive: the singer is off-key an estimated 30% of the time and his voice generally breaks with the moderately to high notes. The guitar playing is uninspired, appears to be off-beat a bit too much, and I have the idea that the guitar(s) are significantly out of tune in half of the songs."
5,FABULOUS,"I LOVE this series. I was surprised by some of the changes that happen in this book, but I think they will make for an even more interesting series. I really enjoy Meg and Quill, the 2 sisters that run the Inn. When I read one of these books, I feel as if I'm reading a letter from an old friend as I've gotten to know the characters and especially enjoy it when they stay in their home town as I've gotten to know most of the townfolk as well."
1,not what i expected,"this item was included in a list of halloween costume items. it wasn't until after i bought it that i realized it was .33 scaled and it wasn't until i received it that i realized .33 scaled is not 33% scaled, this thing is pretty tiny and useless and i returned it about a month ago n still have received no recognition of having done so. i'm very disappointed and worried i won't be reimbursed for this $40.00 paperweight."
5,An Indispensable Book on Mentalism,"This book contains a mammoth collection of mentalism tricks. It contains over 800 pages of more than 200 tricks, covering areas like spirit tests, fortune-telling, symbol tests, psychometry, billet work, etc.The book claims that you should have some knowledge of mentalism and it certainly helps if you have read a classic book like ""Practical Mental Magic"" by Theodore Annemann, which is referenced in some parts of the book. Another alternative is ""13 Steps to Mentalism"" available at most Magic stores that also sell books on magic tricks.However, I personally find that the pre-requisite for some mentalism knowledge is NOT a must. The numerous illustrations and clear instructions make this book easy to understand and follow. This book opens your mind to the world of mentalism and the gadgets used in mentalism performances."
5,What is most interesting about this film,"Is that there are not enough reviews on rottentomatoes dot com to provide an aggregate tomatometer rating. This means it's a film that many of these critics are too cowardly to say anything about. Which is a shame because it's an amazing, thought provoking film. So my advice to you (and therefore myself) is to rely on the populist rating system here @ amazon dot com."
5,great movie!,"this film is not released in france where I live, and I'm a big fan of Al Pacino, so, I'm glad to be able of seeing it. Amazing performance and what a interresting story! Thanks"
4,Useful for my bioethics class,"I bought this movie, not just because it counts with Al Pacino in the main role, but also because I thought it would be useful for my bioethics class, and it is!!! I recommend this DVD."
1,Did not recieve the item,"Never received this item, so I can't review it. I have used it in the past and I also have ordered and received from Amazon. Just never received it."
5,one of the best pop albums ever!,"The Rembrandts rule! You'd think they'd just be one hit wonders wouldn't you? Pulled from obscurity by 'Friends' when I'll be There For You was released but every song on the album is fantastic. The Friends theme tune is on it [that's mainly why I got into them] but there are equally as good songs on the CD including: April 29, There Goes Lucy, Easy to Forget etc. A great album for summer. Classic pop!"
2,Only Just For Friends,"Since the 1990's, The Rembrandts were declared a novelty act in the industry. Surprisingly, the group was declared as a one-hit wonder, but what does the hit lead to? It just leads all the way down into a spiral.The 1995 album, LP, consists of upbeat and strong apply-made titles, including This House Is Not A Home, and sadly, their only one hit, I'll Be There For You, from the mega-hit NBC series, Friends. Sadly, there were edged into the wall, only from the popularity of Friends. Nevertheless, they could still make a good song anyday.The bad part is that many people only bought this album because of the Friends theme. No wonder, they were unable to showw the true colrs, on the radio, or in the mainstream. Don't buy this album, if you only like the Friends theme."
2,"I like Danny Wilde, but.....","I hate that freaking FRIENDS theme song, and I hate that show when it was on, and the reruns, but I really like Danny Wilde's music, since The Boyfriend came out in 86. I like the Rembrandts alot, minus the Friends theme...."
5,my first amazon purchase,"The item arrived in Italy quickly. I found the delivery cost not to be so clear before confirming the order. Anyway, wasn't too expansive.All in all I'm happy about my purchase."
3,Quite beneficial...but not as note worthy as his financial b,"Given's money books can start saving you money immediately. This book is a little more ""airy fairy"", light reading yet Givens manages to keep to the point and provide largely beneficial advice. Much of it is common sense, such as filling your gas tank up early and not speeding -- but it is good to be reminded why. Some is a little gimmicky -- such as the palm accu-pressure for alertness. This book did cause my wife and I to change a few minor bad habits (don't answer the phone if it rings while you are about to leave the house or eat) and having keys in one place. So a lot of little things that together help you get your life in order -- and we could all do with more of that. Recommended light reading."
4,Great second album,"I first ordered both this album and 12 inches.... and I listened to 12 inches... and it is a great album but then I listened to this and it is amazing, he has great instrumentals and a alot of great songs and they don't repeat like in his first album in which he is always taking about the informer. this is a great album that never made it it is to bad that snow was a one-hit wonder because he has the talent."
3,The Snow Man!,"I got this album when it first droped. I was a little disappointed, because this was the ""flip album"" to 12 inch.I was hoping for more Hip-hop/reggae tracks with MC Shan.I think the other albums are better.But, I give Snow credit for stayin ture to himself.Peace to Snow & all fans."
1,Cheap knife,Do not buy this!!!The clever handle broke after 5 chops. And they get rusted very easily.
5,Hollywood screen classics,Very good compilation Cd with classic film scores of the 20th century. Superb recordings by the NPO and Charles Gerhardt.
4,highly interesting reading,"This book gives an overview of ELT in Germany from the 19th century until the present. It reveals the ideological purposes that were often behind one or the other educational policy. For those interested in language planing this book is highly recommended. You have to be prepared to read through 600 pages, though."
5,East coast blues finds home in the Northwest,"Pat Stilwell comes from a long tradition of great D.C. blues/rock guitarists, growing up in southern Maryland and listening to the likes of Danny Gatton, Jimmy Thackery, Link Wray, Punky Meadows, Jorma Kaukonen, Tom Principato, Charlie Byrd, Nils Lofgren and numerous others. Many of his influences can be heard on this album, which combines a clean style of Robert Cray and Greg Allman with Pat's own style of laid back blues and introspective lyrics. Pat went to college in Mobile, AL; that proximity to New Orleans also helped shape his musical style. His alter ego band The Cyclones hold down the fort with some rocking rhythm and blues in the Seattle area. A good indie label blues album from the Northwest."
3,GREAT PRICE! so so quality...,"21 piece cutlery set for how much? Well after receiving the set I can say that you get what you paid for. The set is average and wouldn't be what a chef might be looking for. But for regular house hold folks like me, I guess this set will do."
4,So Far So Good!,"I have had these knives for a month now. Please understand that I do NOT do dishes, so my knives are likely left in a shocking state to kitchen fanatics until my husband finally washes and dries them in the dishwasher. Other reviewers have said how terribly these knifes rust. I have to say I haven't seen any of this so far though!I needed a new set of knives and this one was $100 at my local mall. For a 1/3 of the price on Amazon its stylish and a great buy! It has 2 sets of scissors so I can finally have one to open bags and one to use on food. Much better!"
3,Would rate worse if it weren't for the price!,"We were so excited at how much was included for the price of this set! Overall, a great value, but you get a $20 set of knives. We noticed small rust spots the first time we washed these - there is no excuse for that!! Other than that, we were happy with the block and how much is included in this set. This set will do for the short-term."
4,Not bad as a starter set,"This is good as a starter set. It has a nice variety of knives in a nice holder. The downside is that they don't hold their edges well. If you have a good knife sharpener to go with this, it'll get a new kitchen going."
2,They rust and the blade is flimsy,"This set is attractive because it is inexpensive and has a variety of knives, but a smaller and more expensive set is worth the investment because these knives rust very easily. They have to be washed and towel-dried immediately after each use or they will rust a lot. Also, the blade is rather flimsy and they need to be sharpened often."
3,gift fragrance,i have no personal opinion about this product. i purchased this as a gift and it was lost on the way to the recipient.
5,Delicious,"My husband dislikes strong overpowering fragrances, but we both love Pi. He likes how it is subtle and 'wears' well and I love the smell over all. Great gift for men who want to impress and women who want their men impress."
3,Broken top,"Bought this as a Christmas gift. It didn't ship for about two weeks after ordering but thankfully arrived before Christmas. Unfortunately, the little handle top is plastic and not metal like the larger bottle. The handle snapped off the bottle and then snapped in half. Tried gluing it back but it didn't work. The bottle was boxed and heavily wrapped up, there were no scratches or cracks in the glass, so it was clearly shipped flawed."
5,great CD,"This is one of Sanborns great CDs. My favorite cut is ""For All We know"". I have always liked the song but I guess I have never really heard it."
5,Pearls is one of Mr. Sanborn's greatest albums.,"To describe it in one word, Fantastic!! With Mr. Sanborn playing the alto sax and the orchestra playing in the background, the music flows so beautifully, so romantic, soulful and relaxing. In fact, if you ever have a bad day, just put this CD on, turn off the phone, light some candles, soak in a hot tub and it will take your cares away. Thank you Mr. Sanborn, nobody does it better than you!"
2,Just Not Him,I believe if this album had been recorded by someone else I could have appreciated it a bit more.It's just the David Sanborn that I was raised on The MUZAK thing just didn't work for me
2,A New Standard For Mandatory Reading,"This story has some nice ideas and characters, but in the end it's ALL overshadowed by just how sickeningly generic and forced its messages come off as.Don't judge a book by its cover, and reach out for new experiences once in a while, as stepping outside of your comfort zone will often yield positive results.There, now you don't need to buy the book. Really, that's all there is to it.I typically enjoy David Lubar's writing, I just can't help but feel that this was just a preteen ""coming-of-age in the new millennium"" cash-in. Judging on how many English classes have already adopted it into their curriculum, I'd say it has achieved what I feel it was meant to."
4,Good but..,"This book started out slow and i really wanted to put it down, but I try not to stop reading books when started. After the first chapter i started really liking it. This book taught me many things about life, perspective, and just fun information in general. It is educational, funny, and different. Quiet predictable though which was a negative. Other then that, loved it."
5,Funny Yet Sweet,"This is an entertaining novel about a guy's first year of high school. The main character is kind of an average joe who learns he excels at some things such as writing and fighting. His confidence leads him to stand up for himself and his friends and family when it matters.I laughed out loud several times and smiled throughout. I liked not only the main character, but also his girl friend full of piercings and weird hair, and his guy friend who didn't always obey the law but usually meant well.A Very fun book."
4,"A good book, but stereotypical.","This was overall a very good book. It was written realistically and it is funny yet touching. It tells about Scott's freshman year of high school. It starts on the day before school starts and Scott is hanging with his three friends Patrick, Mitch and Kyle. Over the year, those friendships begin to dissolve-Patrick moves, Mitch falls in love, and Kyle becomes a ""jock"".The only thing that bugged me was that it was kind of stereotypical with the whole ""freshman getting beat up"" thing. I'm now about to be a senior in high school and I have never witnessed this, as a freshman or otherwise. But maybe it happens in other schools..."
2,Summer Reading,"I had to read this book over the summer for Summer Reading. I expected it to be just as dull and uninteresting as the other books I have had to read. Actually, it was better than previous years. However, it was not that good.The characters seemed fake and the plot was totally predictable. (spoiler) It was obvious from the beginning that Scott's mom was pregnant. How could he not see that? And in the end with Lee? I figured out in the beginning that Scott would like her better than Julia. And then the thing with Mouth. Jeez. And his ""friends"" were pretty stupid.I would not recommend this book to most people."
1,Missing pages,"I am in a Young Adult Reader's Club at my school where I teach and this was one of the titles that we were to read. Unfortunately, there are approximately 60 pages that are missing and in their place are pages that appeared earlier in the book. I was very disappointed because other used books I have ordered through amazon.com have been fine."
5,Book,"It came in great shape, and was just as described, good shipping to. The only bad part is that I had to read it over the summer. It's overall a good book."
5,Wide Awake and Dreaming,"Sleeping Freshmen Never Lie is a sweet journey through freshman year through the eyes of a young boy. When he finds out that he is no longer going to be an only child, he starts chronicling his experiences so that his future baby brother can learn from his big brother's mistakes.Freshman year is never easy. With the girl next door type suddenly striking, his mother pregnant, and bullies lurking around every corner, Scott's feeling cornered and queasy. His embarrassing moments are both hilarious and humiliating, making this a notable, poignant work by David Lubar. Highly recommended."
2,Be forewarned!,"This was a required book for my son for summer reading. I decided to read a bit of it and was shocked and suprised by several things. Lots of inappropriate language, references to girls in tight shirts, stealing, suicide, bullying, and several other situations. Parents may want to be aware so that these things can be discussed with their children!!"
2,"Fun,beautiful,but not all that useful","The Domain book is a fun read, my fiance and I enjoyed the personality tests, and found that we're not quite what we expected.As we've moved into our first home, though, I don't go back to this book as a reference for decorating. It was a fun one-time read, with lots of eye candy. If you buy it, buy it for an hour or two of enjoyment, and don't expect much more."
3,Handsome book with limited IDEAS,"Handsome book but narrow in scope, design-wise. The personality designations are fun, but I found the personality quiz and information in The New Decorating Book, which came out before this book, equally fun but more helpful to me and my husband."
1,A WASTE OF MONEY!,"Although I like Domaine furniture, this book was a waste of money. The author seemed to be searching for a new angle but found nothing clever or helpful to offer the reader who is trying to decorate their own home. Perhaps Ms. George should stick to what she does well - selling furniture - and leave books to authors with more innovative ideas"
5,A great design book!,I thoroughly enjoyed this book! After taking the quiz I discovered that I am an Idealist. My fiance took the test and he's an Adventurer. What will we do!! I think what I learnt most from the book is that decorating is fun. The pictures are beautiful and really gave me some great ideas for my home.
5,A Great Gift for Anyone Interested in Home Furnishings,I loved the book and find it to be the perfect gift for everyone I know. It's fun to discover one's personality type and then better understand how one should surround oneself. Those whom I have given the book to as gifts have in turn chosen it as the perfect gift to buy for their friends. I applaud Judy George for making thinking about home furnishings fun and innovative. I love it!
1,not much variety,"I agree with another reviewer who said the examples in this book are on the chilly side. A bit staid -- and staged -- for my taste. I always like personality quizzes, but my husband and I actually got a clearer interpretation of our personalities and more help in applying that information from ""the new decorating book"" that we found on amazon last year. (He's more formal, and I'm more casual, so we're still working that out!!!) We also like ""the healing home,"" because it explains using your personality (as reflected in the things you love) to make your home a calming, happy place."
1,I'm sorry I bought this one,"The blurb and title sound like the book is going to help you explore your personal styles and fine tune your ideas, helping you do things yourself... but the text and the pictures assume that you have enough money to hire a professional decorator. The styles are all cold and extremely impersonal; they look as if they had been designed for a department store display and not for a real people. So save the money from the book and hire the decorator..."
1,Hey look! Another decorating book!,"Without this book, I would have never discovered that I really don't give a toss what personality I should be. Color me ""self knowing without the need for this 80's-rehash-I'm-an-earth-tone whooey."" I demand the cash equivalent of the 43 minutes it took me to read this drivel. P.U."
3,I like the personality approach,"The personality approach is a great idea. Readers who like that approach should also look at The New Decorating Book, which also offers a personality quiz (in the first chapter) and then refers back to the four personality types throughout the book. Personally, I'm glad to see this emphasis on decorating for who you are versus following arbitrary trends."
5,"Fun, Insightful Book -- Interactive: Share with Spouse","This is a wonderfully insightful book into home design that lets the reader learn more about his/her personality, and that gives beautifully pictured examples of the way a person like you might decorate different rooms. Great fun for husband and wife to do together during plane flight or over vacation. Highly recommend this engaging, unique book."
4,Unique approach to style,"This unique book addresses decorating styles based on personality - the visionary, the artisan, the idealist and the adventurer. It contains quizzes to test your style and then shows examples of each type of room for each of the four styles. I liked the page of each style section that states -""You may be an artisan if ..."" and it lists different traits. Also at the end of each style is the alphabet for each style - and it gives buzz words for each style. Very unique and creative; fun to read with good ideas."
1,Narrow in its range of design choices,"I must be looking at a different book than the previous couple of reviewers, because I was disappointed with this book. It doesn't offer much in the way of broad design choices, and the ground it covers regarding decorating for your personality type is better covered in other books. So, the book's topic is nothing new, and its execution leaves a lot to be desired."
3,Smaller than they sound,"I bought these mainly for mailing DVDs. You'd think that when a standard DVD is 5.25 x 7.5, a 6 x 10 mailer would have plenty of room. This is not the case. The DVDs BARELY fit inside. It's very, very snug. I think the measurements are misleading, so beware."
1,"Uh, no.","I never review books on Amazon, but I had to warn readers. This book was terrible...the stories boring and filled with bitterness. The Cleo Barnes story by Chamberline was horrible.I don't suggest purchasing this book as it will likely leave you feeling like you'd wasted both your time and money on it."
3,Just okay,"I read this for a book club and expected more. It was an easy, quick read. The stories were totally predictable and the writing was not very sophisticated. The title was the best part of the book."
2,Dripping with politics...,"Dragon Inn is soaked with political subtext, but manages to wind up a fantastic Kung-Fu epic... The East Is Red is much the same thing with regard to the politics, but the movie suffers for it. Unless you really want to watch a bad kung-fu epic that serves as a metaphor for the handover of China, then I'd suggest staying away from this pitiful film. Swordsman 1 and 2 are far superior and this film is barely a sequel. Just pretend that only 2 Swordsman films were made and that this one was just a bad dream."
4,"good action, fun flick","Kung fu master Ku misguidedly leads Spanish soldiers to the grave of Asia the Invincible (brilliantly overplayed by Brigitte Lin) to seize some Secret Scrolls -- a source of untold power. Well, apparently she's alive, and easily dispatches both the Spanish and a small army of ninjas (whose galleon converts into a submarine), before escaping on the back of a marlin. She now embarks upon a mission to destroy the numerous false pretenders to her title, ripping hearts and bodies asunder with her flying kung fu needles! With insane action sequences and hopelessly botched subtitles, it's hard to tell whether this was intended as a camp masterpiece, a genre parody, or what. - SP"
2,Skip this,"This show is produced due to the highly successful of swordman II. However, it has a lousy plot. It continued from the 2nd episode saying Brigitte Lin is not dead and his (her?) concubine come and find him (her?). Any way, it really has no story plot at all. Just some nice fighting moves and trying to pass off as a movie. Skip this. Worst of the trilogy."
3,"An excellent book, but the price is way too high.","This is a thorough and well-written survey of drinking water disinfectants, their use, applicability, and chemistry. It is up-to-date and otherwise would be a 5-star book. However, the price makes it unaffordable for many who should have access to it."
4,I'm a French Country gal and I really like this book,"I've looked at several French Country books in the past that I didn't get because they were impractical,,,too fru-fru,,to much un-copy-able antiques or furnishings etc. This book worked for me because it gave many avenues of French Country from simple to ornate for real life people. I've gone back to the pictures many times and for the money it's cheaper than 2-3 magazines."
3,Singapore Tour,"Video was more of a tour of eating places in Singapore and its various ethnic foods. If one was expecting Martin Yan's regular cooking humor as seen regularly on TV you would be disappointed. Demonstration was performed by the onsite cooks in Singapore. Detail recipe description is lacking. However, this video is highly recommended for someone who is going Singapore and is loooking to try some local food."
3,Little customer support,"Ordered two of these for our bunch of aging wannabe rockers. The speakers seem like a well made product. Unfortunately the matched pair of speakers don't match. One has a completely different grille from the other. I contacted B-52 customer support and was informed that the boxes should have had a label that said new 2008 grille on them...they did not. The order was filled by Musician's Friend but I can't fault them as the warehouse personnel would never know they were shipping mismatched items. Since these things weigh about sixty plus pounds I was hoping that B-52 would just send me a grille to match and we would be done. But no, they couldn't do that! We won't return the speakers but we won't buy any more B-52 products or recommend them. HOW ABOUT SOME OLD FASHIONED CUSTOMER SERVICE?"
3,Bike lock..,"Got it for my new bike. service was good, it arrived in time. It was delivered undamaged. The quality of the lock is not that of great, and the size is a little small but still managing to use it on my full suspension bike. I would recommend it if you have a not so expensive bike. It is a good product for the price."
1,Obsolete,"Looks like an interesting game and I bought it because I like that the artwork was done by mark ryden. It was a waste of money because you can only play it on a real old Mac computer, if you even have one."
5,GREAT BOOK BUY IT!,Today I hear people saying how horrible the teens years are they don't have to be!! My 3 kids never went through the horrible teen years! It has everything to do with your relationship and love for them this book can really help you have a happy loving teen!
4,Excellent source of information for your growing Teen,"The book is based on the best seller, ""How to really love your children"" published some years ago. I have raised my two baby girls on the basis of ""How to Really Love Your Children,"" and the results with God's grace were astonishing. How to really love your teenager continues on the same theme: Kids as well as teens need to be spoken in the right channels in order for love to be communicated and received by them. Additional information every parent has to know is added to make the book current with the challenges of raising a teenager.I recommend, if you have not read the book, ""How to really love our children,"" read it first-then buy this book, as this book builds on previous foundations.I can't recommend this book enough,Stelios NicolaouAuthor of""Depression: My Witness, Your Solution""(Five easy steps to reprogram your little, inner monologue and set your mind free)"
2,This is not a CATHOLIC monastery!,"I was confused at first when reading this book. The author's Catholic references and background led me to expect Catholic spirituality. Not so! Her minivan is a BUDDHIST monastery! I guess the book is OK for what it is, but I was disappointed that it was not the Catholic book I had been led to believe it was."
5,Great Read,This book was most enjoyable to read. It gave a lot of insights into finding God in the everyday activity of life. Even though I am a guy and do not have a Catholic background I found that I could relate to the stories. Enjoy.
5,"A touching, soulful, inspiring anthology","My Monastery Is A Minivan is a wonderfully readable collection of thirty-five thoroughly enjoyable short stories by author Denise Roy, all of which share the common theme of how family togetherness can bring great spiritual rewards. Spiritual lessons can be so broad as to encompass such mundane activities as driving, breathing, music, and just plain living in these heart warming accounts. My Monastery Is A Minivan is a touching, soulful, inspiring anthology of the many ways any Christian can turn daily routine into divine prayer and submission."
3,nice but small.,"If your child is over 3 yrs of age, its probably to small for them. The top of the sleeper doesn't reach my knees."
2,Not the best choice,"When Tasco bought Celestron a while ago, there were two immediate results. One was that Tasco brought a large cash influx to Celestron that finaiced the development and production of a number of excellent new scopes, like the Nexstar series. The other was the relabeling of a number of Tasco scopes as Celestrons- including the unit under review.This scope is a 3"" short focus Newtonian scope on a flimsy tabletop tripod. It's an attractive looking little package, but as an astronomical telescope it lacks both a stable mount and sharp, contrasty optics. The various 60mm refractors sold by Celestron and Meade for a similar price are a better choice for the beginner on a budget."
4,"must have, especially for the price","if you don't already know Buffalo Tom, order a copy here. the fact that so many copies are available for under a buck is ridiculous. i was a fan of the Boston slop these guys put out when they were in undergrad, and each album just got smarter, more mature, and just plain better, until Smitten, of course, which has exactly 2 rock gems and a bunch of crap. but this is a very inoffensive and nearly flawless pop record. and it helped me get through some very difficult times around 95 and 96. get a copy in time for spring. it is an awesome summer record. then get Big Red Letter Day and Let Me Come Over. then you can decide if you're ready for the earlier, punkier, sloppier goodness."
5,Why this is one of the best CDs ever...,"Irish Indie music ""2FM"" radio Presenter Dave Fanning rated this is as the #1 best album between 1995 and 1998.What does that mean?Plenty since this guy was co-founder of U2 and helped launch their career.BT is nothing like U2 but listen to ""Summer"" from this CD and you will see how catchy they are. This is an A+ album. All the tracks are fantastic. It will have you hooked."
2,Can Rocco read?,"Despite the caliber of information contained within this illogically organized compendium, the copyediting in this work was atrocious. And the errors, extremely distracting. Not worth the paper it's printed on comes to mind..."
4,hdtv without the hdtv price,Was quite the bang for the buck-much more than I had originally realized. Has an incredible picture to it and two excellent built-in center channel speakers.
1,My Panasonic PT-51HX41 broke in just over 2 years,My Panasonic PT-51HX41 broke in just over 2 years. It is $500 to fix and the repairman says that the problem with the amplifiers and resisters on Panasonic TVs are common. Why no recall? Avoid big screen panasonics!!!!
5,Excellent Read!,"This is a wonderful narrative of the history of the Village of Bronxville, NY. (NYC suburb-located in Westchester County). I loved the book, but I may be a bit predjudiced, having been a resident for several decades."
5,"Lucky Dumpling or The Pink Album, it's all good!","Met Jay Jay and Kimmy when I was working a day job with JJ. They invited me out to a Moonpools show, and being gracious, I went. The show was a blast! I kept going to their shows as long as I lived in LA. Little did I know that almost ten years later I'd still be listening to their CDs. One of the few bands, big time, or not, I listen to that frequently."
4,One great alt-rock classic and perfect summertime album!,"LUCKY DUMPLING is a superb and seriously overlooked alt-rock classic from the mid-90's. Back around '96 you may have heard ""Hear"" somewhere on the TV or radio and wondered ""who was that?"" before it became merely a distant memory. Moonpools & Caterpillars' infectious pop sensibility will win you over on this album. ""Kimi"" Ward Encarnacion's vocals fall somewhere amongst Natalie Merchant, Dolores O'Riordan and Gwen Stefani -- sparkly and earthy. Standout songs are: ""Hear"" (why wasn't this a bigger hit?), ""Ren"", ""Soon"" (beautiful, anthemic and yearning), ""Colossal Youth"", ""Heaven"" and ""Sundays"" (another gorgeous pop gem). Do yourself a favor and pick up this album -- it may just become a one of your favorites for the coming summer!"
3,Kewl. Peppy. Like strawberry syrup.,"I had never heard of Moonpools and Catillars prior to 1999. And the only reason i know of them now is because they were in a Disney chabbel movie called wisihng on a star. They played the school band at a high school winter festival, and as soon as i heard the intro to soon, i pushed on the closed caption and proceeded to sing along. In some scenes, i was seriously irked, because i couldn't here the words over the dialouge. But i waited until the credits (fortunetly, they come up pretty quickly) and went to amazon.com as soon as i found out who they were. now that i have the c.d, i've made it a mission of mine to find the pink album, twelve songs. i highly recommend anyone into the whole poppy indie scene pick this up."
5,Get ready to jump around the house!,This is an absolutely fun CD. It is not often that you get clever lyrics with funky music that isn't loaded with sex and drug inuendos. This soundtrack is very refreshing. I hope they don't stop with just this one CD.
5,Surprisingly Good,"This was an amazing CD. The vocals on it are the best. I first heard this band on the Disney movie ""Wish Upon a Star"". I was asking myself...""is this Disney?"" If you want a fun CD buy Lucky Dumpling."
4,Lucky you! You've searched for Lucky Dumpling.,"I LOVE Moonploos and Caterpillars. I first heard them on the Disney Channel's movie Wish Upon a Star when they sang in a concert for a high school. I got interested, so I wanted to see if I could actually purchase this amazing band's album. I searched on amazon and I found it! I was sooooooo thrilled! The song Hear is always a great song to just get your groove on with! It's awful how their record label dropped them. What were they thinking? You should pick up this CD NOW!!!!"
5,The Southern Hospitality Cookbook,A wonderful cookbook. Easy to use and everything we have made is good tasting.
2,Unsatisfied textbook order,"The worst text book ordering experience that I've ever had.The book that I ordered was used but supposed to be close to new. After receiving the book, I was very disappointed. There are about 10 pages missing, and there are copy notes and even some personal notes from the last person who used the book inside here or there. Apparently, the seller didn't even check the condition of the book before wrapped it up for sale."
5,Useful and up-to-date,"To my mind, Nolting's book is the best one in the field of protein folding. This book is a very useful source for biochemistry students. It is excellent, comprehensive and precise."
1,Not even worth it,"In Charles Wright's book Appalachia there are many poems which do not have any apparent point. When speaking about the pointlessness of the book, the poem ""Opus Posthumous"" comes to mind. This poem does not have any meaning; it is not even a desirable poem to hear. Charles Wright wrote his poems either only for himself or a select few that might understand his off the wall creations. At first I thought that the poems were some kind of joke, but the punch lines never came. Charles Wright apparently wrote Appalachia not with the purpose of actually trying to write acceptable poetry, but was only trying to get some words onto paper so that it could be published. Appalachia is by far the worst book that I have read in years. I have seen better poetry written by teenagers. It is a waste of paper, time, and money. I only hope that contemporary poetry does not follow in the footsteps of Charles Wright, because poetry of this kind belongs in the trash."
3,Inspiring drum beating,"This book speaks to God's miracles and puts denial in your face. Be prepared to love the book and depending upon your level of belief it may catapult you forward or it may be to direct at some points. Either way, it is an extremely enjoyable quick read!"
4,Used book,"Shipping was very fast!Book was lightly used, and book cover was was tattered (more than I would like for the price $6.99).Tari describes the Holy Spirit's leading of the Church youth into various specific gospel missions.The supernatural power demonstrated through the youth to accomplish the missions and the resulting large numbers of new deciples generated lead me to believe orthodox Christain denominations methods of conducting missions without the supernatural power and specific guidance of the Holy Spirit is not the way to do it."
5,Excellent,"This true story is so inspiring and moving, everyone who professes to be a Christian should read it. Those wishing an understand of a deeper relationship with our creator will find it encouraging."
1,Not worth it,"I was expecting more of a diary type of book - what we did on our dates, where we went, etc. But this book focuses solely on the woman and has no space for the interactions between man and woman. Not recommended."
1,Why would you need this?,"Chances are if you follow The Rules then you're going to end up with a pretty useless journalWeek 1Monday Still no boyfriendTuesday Still no boyfriendWednesday Still no boyfriendThursday Still no boyfriendFriday Still no boyfriend, signed up for horse riding classRepeat ad infinitum"
4,Labtec Pulse 424 speakers,"I just got these speakers last week and they are amazing. The 8"" driver on the sub gives great bass and no distortion. The satellite speakers could be a little better, but otherwise the system is great for the price."
1,BORING..................,"When the best thing you can say about a film is that the actors are attractive, you know it's bad."
2,A very dry account,"I barely got through this book; it is an extremely dry, chronological account of the evolution of spanish anarchism. It is filled with an abundant amount of dates, names and whatnot. I'd recommend it to readers that are sincerely interested in the totality of spanish anarchism - for others, I'd suggest isolated accounts of the revolution."
5,Making sense out of chaos,"Bookchin does an excillent job of presenting the often chaotic history of pre-Civil War Spain in a clear and organized manner. Possessing a clear writing style and an excillent grasp of the movement in general, Bookchin's book is an asset to anyone interested in Spanish history or Anarchism in general."
2,didn't do much,This brush was kind of horrible. The bristles don't really pull the loose hairs out and I ended up buying another kind at my local pet store.
4,Didn't work for my dog but a decent product,"I bought this for my german shep mix and it didn't seem to pull out any of his under coat. I had better luck with my furminator . This would probably be a great choice for malmutes , saint bernards ect. The product is fine, nothing wrong with it and it should last a long time, just not for my dogs coat length."
1,Be careful of this one!,"This is, without even half trying, the worst travelogue I have ever seen! It is a second-hand account of where scenes from the famous 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy were shot, as if this were the only thing that has ever happened in New Zealand. I bought this particular product because I am in the process of emigrating to New Zealand, and I thought this film might give some kind of overview of the country, it peoples, its culture, its universities, its night life, its customs, job opportunities, frail-care facilities (I have an elderly mother) and so on and so on; it is anything but that! If you want a down-to-earth, honest-to-goodness, informative documentary, don't even look at this product; it's rubbish!"
1,Not worth buying...,"As a child growing up in Osage, author Sidney Lee and I have different accounts of his mother's store. This book is filled with mumbo-jumbo and filler. Not enough accurate and historical information therefore not worth reading IMO."
3,Indigo by Beverly Jenkins,"I love all Beverly Jenkins books however, this one was a little diasappointing to me. Before Hester Wyatt met her love interest in Galen Vachon she was a spiritual, church going individual. She regularly prayed and everything. However,after being involved with Galen, she becomes the total opposite of what she was at the beginning of the book. I really don't think that the author should set us up to believe that Hester is a good, Christian girl in the beginning only to have her be the complete opposite (someone who has let go of her very own morals )at the end."
1,Not what I expected,"This book was presented as primarily a historical novel.Its basically a very unrealistic smut novel with somehistory sprinkled in. It reads such that you are onlyhoping for the main couple to finally get it on, and themain character is sooo not a dimensional or realistic character.I read the reviews before I bought this, and they did not acurately describe the book at all. It does have some steamyscenes that were well done--but again not too realistic.I guess if you want an escaptist book that doesn't have a coverwhich gives it away as a tacky romance--this is the book for you."
4,Left me wanting to know more. . .,"Independent, strong-willed, courageous and naive, Hester was the epitome of a strong women. Charming, intelligent, handsome, not to mention, wealthy, Galen was every woman's dream. Hailing from different backgrounds, the two seemed like a very unlikely couple, but the heat between them was so intense that it left me wondering where are the real-life Galen's? The cliff hanger at the end of the book made me just shake my head, because I have to read the next one in the series to know what happens next! Once again, kudos to Ms. Jenkins for a job well-done! She captures the imagery and details of the time period and crafts a wonderful tale out of our history."
5,"Great, Great Book","This is a great, great book. I got enjoyment and education. Yes, this is a multiply reread."
4,Great Read!,"This is a wonderful book. I was a little skeptical with the first few pages, but once the ""Black Daniel"" arrived I couldn't put it down. His and Indigo's battle of the wits kept me laughing and his persistent pursuit of Indigo was humerous and loving at the same time. This read will not disappoint you."
5,my first book,"i love this book it was the first one i read by the author and i couldnt put it down. this was one of those books that make u cry,smile and wish u could meet a man like that. i wish it could be made into a movie"
5,Legendary Romance and History at it's Best: A MUST READ.,"This is an incredible book. Mrs.Jenkins is a superb writer and historian. The story of Hestor and Galen renewed my interest in reading. The plot was better than a movie and the romance was sweeter than any modern day courtship. This is a story set in slavery times, but with a wonderful blend of mystery, intrigue and special romantic interludes. OH HOW ROMANTIC....In a modern society, where relationships are based on things, this story highlights the special ways two people share the simplicity of life in little things ""like making mud pies together"" all while dealing with the hardship and adversity of slavery issues. I have recommended this book to many friends and family and they have all shared an enthusiatic response.A MUST READ....this book is worth its weight in gold."
5,Indigo,The book is well written and not predictable and also let you know that blacks were more than just slaves and all blacks weren't always to be trusted. I didn't want to put it down and I'm now looking for other books by the author to read.
5,Exciting,I was happy to introduce Beverly Jenkins to ITCOMS. Indigo was up to par. Members loved the story and the characters. Beautiful black people and a wonderful romance. We loved it! For most members this was their first exposure to historical romance and what a starter! It is a quick and easy read.Entertainment to the utmost.
1,Ring,I was very disappointed that when I got this item it was bent. It took a long time to try and return it also.
5,Un Tesoro...,"Juan Luis Guerra is perhaps the most prolific songwriter today.This album is a testament to a man whose command of the spanish language is awesome and so very rich. That fact that he plays the guitar so beautifully is not lost as the melodies just seem to linger on when the songs are finished. Every song that he writes becomes a hit, his slowdown of ""Guisiera"" is remarkable as only he can do. For all music lovers, that appreciate well written music played to warm and romantic rhythms,this is a must have."
3,"It's missing the best song of all - ""Reina Mia!""","Looking for the 440 CD that includes the unforgettably romantic song ""Reina Mia,"" I came across this CD, already having a copy of Los Grandes Exitos de 440, which also does not have the song on it. For anyone who's never heard the ecstatic, upbeat, joyoyus ""Reina Mia,"" you haven't heard all that Juan Luis Guerra has given us. For me, every, rare, time that I hear it, it brings tears of joy to my eyes - my brother-in-law Jose played it for us the night of our wedding when he hosted a second wedding reception party at his home. The harmonies, fast beat, beautiful lyrics and joy of this song should not be missed by any collection that purports to be the Coleccion Romantica of Juan Luis Guerra y Quatro Quarenta - I don't know why it's been left off, sadly..."
2,not enough tale in the telling,"There are endless discussions about what is pornography vs erotica vs romance. Well this is definitely not a romance. Although set in the 1800's, there is very little sense of time or place. It has HEA endings, obligatory in erotica, but really, it's nothing but sex scenes with very slight links between them, which is how I think of pornography. Utlimately it was too slight to hold my attention, and it's not a keeper. All that sex with no feelings for the characters or sense of connection between them (aside from the physical, that is) makes it too much sugar, not enough substance. Not a wallbanger, but it didn't work for me."
3,For hard-core Vinicius fans only,This band has good musicians overall - but they sound like they would've been a bit better with a little more rehearsal time... Vinicius' studio efforts are so flawless and fresh - the calrity just amazing - that this live effort fails to live up to its promise. Not to mention that most of these tunes can be found on other studio albums.The musicians on his studio albums are top notch as well. Start there first...
1,Lyte on true hip hop,"I just have to say I bought this album after listening to one track - ""I Can't Make A Mistake"" - and expected similar grooves for the rest. It didn't happen. The majority of the songs on this CD are almost too soft to be called rap, and might more readily fall into the category of R+B. Sorry, Lyte, while the skills are there, this album didn't make the cut."
2,martingale in sheep's clothing,"So I'm studying modern portfolio theory in school including asset allocation and the efficient frontier thesis when I stumble upon William Bernstein's texts. In his books are recommendations to learn about value averaging as descibed in this book by Michael Edleson.As I begin reading, I quickly realize this is simply the stock market version of the Martingale gambling system which in stock market terms is a short volatility or mean reversion strategy. This text explain how this strategy is a winner, but in reality, it only works if the market is always going up year over year. In a big market crash like that of 08, this strategy gets crushed as it goes all in after the first dip.Maybe some have faith in this methodology but personally, I think it's a statistical gimmick that doesn't respect the fat tails of the real marketplace. I know this strategy has a cult following, but I won't be participating in it or dollar cost averaging."
2,Better than Dollar Cost Averaging?,"This book shows how to make sure you really buy low and sell high. Dollar Cost Averaging works during asset accumulation phase only. You really have to do the opposite during asset withdraw phase of you life. It works for asset accumulation and asset withdraw phases of life. One drawback is the focus on continuing streams of new deposits. So you have to improvise somewhat if you are just reallocating from a static portfolio that is meant to grow over time. Works best for that portion of portfolio meant to grow. The portion used for withdrawals should be treated strictly from your non-equity ""safe money"" assets used for short term (<7 years) goals giving time for the long term target to be achieved.author seems to have biography that I think should be left out of the book. His personal life may bias your opinion of the content of this book."
5,"Chakras, Auras, and New Spirituality","Meditations and exercises to attune you to higher vibrational energies. Explore the seven bodies, raise your consciousness and learn to see and read auras. Comprehensive exercises for spiritual transformation."
2,where are the chakras?,"interesting information, not for the reader who is totally new to new age stuff, overly simple meditation, NO MENTIONS OF CHAKRAS WHATSOEVER."
1,Nothing About Chakras,"Considering it's the first word in the title, I expected this book to have something on Chakras - no dice. Not even listed in the index. Some of the meditations are o.k. but this book is ultimately way too hippy dippy and religious for me and focused too much on the ""spirituality""; i.e., religious aspects of meditation. I wish that it had focused more on tangible health concerns which can be studied through understanding chakras and alignment with your own body and humanity, rather than some divine mumbo jumbo."
4,Slow shipping but Great Product,this took about 2 weeks to arrive but it works with all of the various brass rods I have collected thru the years. No need to worry about damaging the barrel any longer this product works Great.I recommend it.
1,Religious garbage,"Unless you're in dire spiritual need. Do not even think for a second of buying this junk. There is in fact a reason these cd's are so cheap 2nd hand . . . It's all ""Jesus loves you"" in a new grungy-sounding package. Nice try. But no thanks. If I'd want that I'd go to church."
2,Wyeth fan,"I am a HUGE Wyeth fan. It was an interesting angle, one at first I was afraid was bordering on ""stalking"" but then I got it. Trying to know the path he was walking without intruding was difficult, but made the man more human for me. I enjoyed the read."
2,Too small - not detailed enough,Tghe format is too small. Not detailed enough. No street index. more indexing would help.
4,Helpful for Pet Owners,"Although Dr. Winter's manual is technically written for other holistic vets, I've gotten a lot out of it as a lay pet owner. I use it together with Anitra Frazier's New Natural Cat to try to understand what's going on with my guys when something doesn't seem quite right. It has helped me, with its clear layout of symptoms, factors and options, sort through both what and how serious a given problem might be. It also, under the ""holistic challenge"" heading in each section and through the numerous essays in the back, has helped me understand the difference between holistic and conventional approaches to health problems, which in turn has helped me be a better participant in my pet's care. The Holistic Veterinary Handbook isn't the only resource I use, but it's a valuable one."
2,not what i expected for,"First of all i was looking for a book that describes each super heroe's style, character, super powers in detail, even i expected a scala or a chart showing his/her powers, intelligence, agility, dexterity out of say, 10 or 100 what ever. But none is available, just a brief explanation of how he /she is created, and etc. No description of his/her adventures, friends, the very popular speciality etc.I bought this book with 2 other books ""The superhero book"" (visible ink production) and ""comic book encyclopedia"" (ron goulart) and none of them satisfied me.However ""comic book encyclopedia"" (ron goulart)is the only one which provides all superheroes with ""pictures"" other books doesnt even provide picture for all characters but some mostly known ones.i dont recommend this product for those who is familiar with the super heroes but to those who knows nothing about comics."
4,Covers the exam very well,This book hits all of the objectives of exam 70-80! The book has several good practice exams that were helpful and thought provoking. Points to good references. I learned a LOT from this book!
4,A complete guide to computer history.,"Clear, but brief details on a vast array of the people, machines, and problems associated with the invention of the computer. It's a very picture intense book that makes learning the computer age interesting and somewhat exciting. This extensive collection of pictures ranges from the real news articles to the inventors actually working the machines. This book acts as a perfect quick-reference to the computer age."
3,CD player review.,"Fine in most respects, but it doesn't have memory for going back to track you were on once you stop play. That's annoying as it's used by a blind person for audiobooks. Should provide that info on whether these older players have those features or not. On plus side, nice easy big buttons for blind person to manipulate."
5,"Captain Mary, Buccaneer",This novel is exciting from the start. It's a fascinating topic and Ms. Simonds kept the action colorful and surprising. I was drawn in to the life of Captain Mary and had to keep those pages turning to find out how she would negotiate or fight her way out of the problems that arose. This is 100% entertaining!
5,"Captain Mary, Buccaneer, by Jacqueline C. Simonds","This is a zinger of a book! I read it in a couple of days plus one midnight to 3 a.m. stint, because I became so interested that I didn't want to pause. Captain Mary is a complex, believable character; true to her own personal code of honor, yet torn as well as triumphant over the difficulties of the bloody times in which she lived.The power of the sea and its mystery are well portrayed as is the uncertainty of charts and actions of men and their governments.The writer has brought history to life with all the sound, fury, blood and guts of the age she is representing. The action sings with the slash of the sword and the shouts of the boarding pirates; yet Mary, the buccaneer, is a woman shown in tender moments, foolish decisions, terrible consequences and bitter victory. No trite formulas spoil the reader' s suspense or anticipate the poinancy of Mary's joys and sorrows.This book is as unpredictable and astonishing as history itself."
4,Greatest Hits,"If you like the 50's and 60's this is a great CD.Some of the songs are very hard to fine,my number 1 is A Little Bit Of Soap"
3,still not sure,easy hooked up old PS/2 dell keyboard to new dell usb port..only needed 1 connector..ONLY problem sometimes keyboard is NOT recognized !!!!!SOLUTION..just unplug/plug back in keyboard PS/2 to PS/2 connector.......BUT WHY ??????
5,USB Adapter,I purchased the StarTech to connect a mouse and keyboard to a netbook via USB. I also wanted a quality adapter - one that would have a solid connection to both mouse and keyboard for accuracy in movement and responsiveness. This product did what I wanted. I have used it for over a month now and am very satisfied with it.
5,StarTech.com USB to PS2 Keyboard and Mouse Adapter (USBPS2PC),"I purchased this item based on the positive reviews of other customers. So far, I have been extremely happy with the adapter. I am only using it for a PS2 keyboard right now (although I did test it as well on a PS2 mouse) and it works great. All the functionality of my keyboard (sound volume dial, various control buttons) has been maintained, which was my major concern. Highly recommended for those who love their old PS2 keyboards and don't want to have to throw them away just because they got a new computer."
2,Well...,"Bought this product for connecting a PS/2 keyboard and Wii gamesystem several weeks ago. Sometimes works sometimes not. Don't know why but if you disconnect it and then re-plug back, it goes back to work. Anyway it is annoying. I haven't tried to use it on computer. I am not happy with it and won't recommend it to anyone."
5,Keyboard rises again ...,"Our Sony Vaio quality keyboard from a retired desktop with a PS/2 connector has now been cleaned up and plugged into the StarTech adapter, which has been plugged into a USB socket of the new CPU. It's now working flawlessly as I type this ^_~"
2,Wasn't very useful..,"Short thin little book wasn't worth the money. I didn't learn anything new and the pictures were not very great either. I received the book, read through it cover to cover in 10-15 minutes, placed it on the shelf and it's been there ever since."
3,"Great starter guide, but by no means comprehensive","We are six months into life with our labrador, and there is no question that things were made much easier by having this book, if only to reassure you that you are doing the right thing. I would have liked it if the book had been a little more forthcoming on the drawbacks of owning a labrador. Not that I would have changed my mind about buying one, but it would have been nice to have been prepared for the problems of shedding, and the slow maturity, etc. On the other hand, the book is small and [inexpensive], and never claims to be a comprehensive guide. If you are thinking about taking the plunge, this book covers 80% of the information that you need to know, but I would strongly recommend that you find the rest of the information through an internet search. This book calls itself a Complete Pet Owner's manual, but it isn't. But, given the low price, the book is good value."
2,"Good general guide, but not for more experienced dog owners","This book would be good for the new lab owner, or someone looking into the breed for the first time, but if you read several of these breed books, they are all almost exactly the same except for maybe a chapter on the breed. It's decent for general knowledge, but if you want in-depth information on dog traning, care, or the breed, look elsewhere."
5,"Fun, Informative, Comprehensive","This is a fun book, full of useful information, easily accessible to Lab owners who are non-professional but want to raise their dogs right. Discussions on proper food, health, training tips, and understanding your Lab are comprehensive. Kern's directive that lessons for puppies should be short and fun are applicable to these chapters as well -- Kern knows his readership as well as his puppies. The pictures are engaging, the chapters well-organized and concise, and overall, the book is an extremely useful primer."
5,One of the Best Gospel Albums,"Salah has not only brought Gospel and G-Funk together into a annoited amalgamation of song, but has also put his heart and soul into the lyrics and vocals on this album. This is a must have for anyone who loves Gospel music."
3,Act! v. 9.0 buggy,"Yet again a new purchaser of Act!, Sage, in an attempt to brand it as it's own, has rushed a software product to market that has bugs in it.After successfully installing it, converting my database, I had to spend 1 hr with Tech support because there was a problem with the country field. The TS person had a hard time determining what was causing the problem. As a result I determined that I would have to spend the money for 1 yrs worth of technical support. Next there are problems in the Reports area. The Contact Report frequently opens a blank document. I have not spent the time with TS on this issue as I dislike the idea of spending another 1 hr of MY busy time with them."
2,I preferred it to 'War Dragons' but. . .,"A good effort. I preferred it to the seriously flawed `War Dragons' with it's sundry continuity errors. But objectively I can't rate it any higher than the first book in the series. Captain Picard and Lt Worf undercover, an interesting premise. It had all the ingredients; a few space battles, intrigue, lost treasure and a beautiful woman at the heart of it all ; the mysterious captain: `Red Abby'. but it lacked a little sauce, some flavour. There just wasn't enough of the Enterprise D crew to make it more palatable. A novelised version of the double STNG episode `Gambit ` from Picard's point of view would have been a better idea as it is `Dujonian's Hoard' is but a pale imititation."
1,Worst one of the series so far,"I read Captain's Table #1 and immediately chased it with this one. Like drinking the hair of the dog on a morning after, this one tasted awful. I actually quit reading the book in frustration after struggling to get through the long-winded passages describing the intricate details of the various ships, weapons, crew members, etc. I'm a fan of action-adventure, but this was pure torture. The writer made me feel like Capt. Picard is truly a boring storyteller -- not that the story itself isn't interesting, but that *he* couldn't tell it well. The interruptions from the captain's listeners aren't as frequent as in the previous book (or in later ones). Those interruptions, IMO, help to break up the story, provide suspense, and keep it from dragging. ""Dujonian's Hoard"" needed those interruptions more frequently, and it doesn't get them. As a result, the story gets bogged down in the details."
2,Too Much in Love with the Framing Story,"The tale told by Captain Picard in this second ""Captain's Table"" novel is, in and of itself, amusing but not engrossing. Almost all of the pleasure one could get from it is sapped by the ever-increasing interruptions that return us to the far-too hokey Captain's Table bar. The interruptions do not, as one reviewer suggested, lend a sense of realism. Rather, they continually remind us how contrived the whole set up is. As with War Dragons, the tale itself is *not* written in the way one would expect a story to be told at a bar, and Picard's voice is not always captured. My advice to those who are about to read this one: read only the chapters captioned ""Tale."" Skip all of the others.Michael Jan Friedman is ordinarily among the best of the Trek writers; it is unfortunate that he allowed himself to get roped into the Captain's Table idea. A fine talent, an interesting challenge (a first-person Picard tale), but a wasted effort."
4,Another shine of Picard's love for archaeology,Michael Jan Friedman writes another amazing tale. This book shows once again Picard's incredible desire for archaeology. My second favorite Captain's Table book (favorite being Once Burned).
2,Drudgery. Lacking excitement at any turn.,"In the first of the series, War Dragons, there is wonderful excitement and continuity of the story. This is always commendable, but more so when you realize the dual nature of the story. In this poor follow up, Picard cannot capture our imagination in the same way. The story is constantly interrupted by the audience. You don't have the time to build excitement enough to care what is going to happen next. The ending is predictable, (Picard never waivers), and even Worf manages to sound boring in this tale. Oh well. I'll still read The Mist and the others. I'm looking forward to Pike's tale."
1,Bad Story,A weak star trek novel. The story was nothing but fighting - not very deep. Not much point to it.
4,A good adventure!,"Don't let the cover of this book fool you- this book takes place in 2370-early 2371 on the Enterprise-D... before the Enterprise-E and the grey mustard uniforms have been put in use. Great book. I bought mine used, and I thought that it was a good adventure to see Picard stand alone, and having to run into the Cardassians and the Romulans and to see Worf in action."
4,Cute!!,"Adorable little frame, just wish it had been a little bigger, but still cute and my Mom (who received the frame as a Christmas gift) loves it as well."
2,are you serious...,"yea so the cable keep going out right and my moms just keep renting videos....but what the hell is this?! Like everyone said it was a good concept but not a good movie. I think the director only made this movie cause he wanted to feel up Lil Kim. Was all her little sex scenes really needed? And why is Bobby Brown in anyone's movie...I don't understand why that horse is dancing at the end...are you serious, are you just going to end the movie that way like it had something to do with the plot. I gave this movie 2 stars cause I like Stacey Dash as an actress and I have a thing for guns, I'd be shooting everyone too. The movie confuses me...to try and make sense of it will make your head hurt...just laugh if you happen to come across it."
3,Superb,The movie was okay. The only thing that I did not like was the Macy Gray character. The cowgirls never got the chance the see her.
1,Great Attempt...,"Gang of Roses is great attempt to do something that hasn't been done as the director stated. It's influence is like Posse meets Set It Off. The plot is somewhat original and seems promising but the sequence of the movie throughs it off. Also the low budget-ness made the movie suffer and some of the acting is inconsistant....But now that I've got the bad stuff out the way, the good in this movie is to see this actors/rapper be an ensemble in such a form. The audacity to to do that gains points alone. The moral of the story( as Lil' Kim would start of one of her rap versus) Is that dont expect this to be a hit( hince that why I went straight to DVD, but dont expect it to be a Glitter. For the budget and the cast it's pretty well attempt....It is what it is. Definately worth checking out!"
1,Not the best girl power movie,"I was looking for an empowering girl movie, but I thought this movie was cheesy and SLOW. The concept was ok, black/asian cowgirls, but with the exception of Monica Calhoun, I thought the acting was pretty crappy. What was up with Macy Gray's character? I didn't get that at all, or why she killed off one of the characters. It would have been neat if it weren't so poorly acted, and again- cheesy and slow.If you want a good girl power movie, try ""Enough"" or ""Double Jeopardy""."
2,I have six words for you,"Bobby Brown is in this movie.I could say more, like how some of the phrases do not belong like ""chill out"" let's forget you're in the ""wild west"" and it's hot there. Or how about instance lust worth being heartbroken and dying over. And the end, I had to watch it again with someone because I did not understand it. There were a lot of incomplete, unanswered and just plain ""no one was thinking when this script was written or ""acted"" out. But once again I reiterate BOBBY BROWN WAS IN THIS MOVIE, personal if I had known that I would not have bought it, because after watching it [...] was too much.Instead try ""Bad Girls"" with Drew Barrymore and Madline Stowe, ok so there are no black people in it, but it was still a great movie.I had to come back and edit to ask, where in the Wild West did they get BRAIDS, braids man, not cornrows but braids. Inconsistencies!!!!!!!!!!!!But you know I will watch this movie with my friend for a good laugh!"
5,very satisfied,no problem with delivery.movie in great condition.I would recommend this seller to anyone .
3,Ok,"I am not into Westerns by a long-shot, but the only reason I watched this movie is because of the actresses. I will say they were doing their thang. I was shocked to see Lil' Kim act or I may say her lack of acting. Lil' Kim is my gyrl but she needs to stick the the rapping script. Stacy Dash was the straight thug and so was LisaRaye.The storyline was ok and I love how they were riding the horses. I will say that this is not an item to purchase, rent it, unless you like Westerns."
3,Not the best but if you want laughs.....,"Listen, I thought ""Posse"" even had it's moments, it was not the best western, but it was entertaining. The same goes for ""Gang of Roses"", you can't take this seriously; I'm giving 3 stars, cause my friends and I laughed the whole movie, I mean really, the chinese chick had cornrows, Lil' Kim's breasts were all over the place, and LisaRaye's white clothing never got dirty. Talk about Diva in the West. Please, the laughs is what made me give this movie 3 stars."
5,Magnificent,"As Joyce's first mature work, Dubliners comes close to being a work of art. It does have its failings though, which this Viking Critical Edition helps the reader past. For instance, those unfamiliar with late 19th century Irish politics would be completely lost by a story like ""Ivy Day in the Committee Room."" The notations provided in the appendix, however, allow the reader to understand the references and to actually gain insight into the past.For anyone looking for an introduction to Joyce, this edition of Dubliners is certainly the place to start. Those already familiar with his works may gain new insight by this edition. Either way, a must own."
5,Dubliners,"An excellent annotated edition of the great workof Irish and world fiction. If you need commentariesand helpful insights into this complex work, this isthe one."
4,good start on Joyce,"James Joyce lurks in my home, the mammoth Ulysses sitting heavily upon my shelf, mocking me, sending chills down the back of my neck and dashing thoughts of actually making it through the tome unscathed. So it was with much trepidation that I tackled this earlier work by Joyce.I was most pleasantly surprised to discover this collection of Dublin tales to be very accessible, and while I no doubt missed much of the poetical allegory present in his work, following the basic meanings of the story was within my reach. Ulysses may be as different to this as Faulkner's As I Lay Dying was to The Sound and Fury, but I hope not.An relatively easy and enjoyable start if trying to work your way through Joyce's works."
4,good,this item is as i expected. it helped me in completing my collection of the totally country cd music series.
1,worst of the totally country series,Can't recommend this one. I am a huge fan of country music especially the new stuff. Not this collection. Where is George Strait? Where is Gary Allan? Not even the best from Dirks Bentley. Save your money on this one. Miranda Lambert is hardly on the charts. Why does she have a selection let alone being first on the album?
1,WARNING !DVD Sytem has a defect that Panasonic will not repair.,"This DVD home theater system has a defect that is not being addressed by panasonic. The Optical lens and or DVD Motor will give out after 2 to 3 years for no reason. It will start saying ""No Disc"" and will not play any DVD or CD. To repair this it will cost you $170.00 to $190.00 to repair. An authorized panasonic repair company told me that if I repair this it will last me up to 3 years and I would have to fix the DVD Player again. The dvd player model number is SA-HT70 and the number for the system is SC-HT70. The SA-HT70 is the dvd player that is not reliable. Without warning in 2 to 3 years you will have to repair the optical lens or dvd motor which will not be covered by Panasonic."
3,Definte OK on this,"The system is definitely OK. The major hang ups are stated in most reviews; the time it takes to switch cds/dvds is pretty long and I have the same problem on my 3 yr old system regarding it not reading discs. The sound quality is very nice though. I am looking at the HT700 system next, but I want to find out about the lens/motor problem with my HT70 first."
4,Great Bank for your Buck,"This system is a great way to get into DVD on a limited budget.It took more time to figure out where to put my speakers then it did to actually set up the system. It was quick, easy, and the instructions were simple and to the point.The surround works great and the volume levels are fine.My only disapointment is that MP3 CD's cannot be randomized, either with other CD's or on a single CD. So you have to listen to them in the order that they appear. The screen lists # but gives no title etc, so it can be a little difficult if your looking for a specific song.But that said, it is a great system and for the buck you get a lot of features. I would buy it again given the chance."
2,"Nice book if you have a wonder husband, men should read it","Some of the ideas in this book were useful, but many ""helpful"" tips were based on two premises: 1) that you have extra money and 2) that you have an extremely supportive husband.For example, p. 211 says ""Richard could see that I was about to collapse, so he immediately called a nearby hotel, made a reservation, and sent me away..."" Checking into a hotel for a good night's rest (along with many other suggestions by Eyre) doesn't exactly fit into most one-income multiple-child families.And I couldn't help but chuckle when I read p. 249, ""Most husbands would be delighted to be asked to listen to or feed children for fifteen minutes before work while you clear out your cobwebs."" Oh really? Let's take a survey on that one!"
4,Good mixture of practical and spiritual parenting suggestion,"As a mother of eight, Linda Eyre certainly is qualified to share the ups and downs of being a mother. She gives good concrete suggestions on how to respond to the inevitable problems a mother faces. However, I couldn't follow some of the religious, Mormon references in the book which are central in this family's life."
2,Totally lame,"I should have known to stop reading when one of the author's first suggestions for lowering stress was to hire someone to do my housework for me! I guess if I had written a bunch of best-selling books and had a super-successful husband, I could do that! All of her stories seemed to have something to do with a trip overseas, a remodeling project in her house, or her husband who worked for the President in Washington, D.C. It almost felt as though she was teasing her reader - as if to say, look how well travelled and wealthy you must be able to gather we are. I wouldn't recommend this book to any other mothers I know who are hoping to find more joy in their lives."
4,Very Scholarly Old Testament Theology,"This book is for those who want an OT theology that is very detailed, highly-technical, and painstakingly exegetical. Sailhamer's book is not like the other OT theology books (e.g., Brevard Childs, Walter Kaiser, Eugene Merrill and Roy Zuck, Ralph Smith, and Bruce Waltke) that deal primarily with themes, messages, and ideas of the OT. The book is primarily hermeneutical and methodological (in fact, the major portion of the book [pp. 29-194] deals with methodology!). If one is looking for a thematical OT theology this book is not for you (try Kaiser, Smith, or Waltke). However, this is an excellent book for those who like to get into the nitty-gritty of OT exegesis and theological methodology. It is a difficult book to read so this book isn't for those who like to cruise through a book."
3,Good women,"More like confused women, Millie is married but a lesbian with children and a loving husband (friend) Gertrude is confused ,married with children and attracted to women. Is it likely that a woman will leave one brother for another eventhro she knows she likes women, under the belief that maybe it will be different if not better with someone who loves her but still wants basicially the same things as her first husband his brother. She turns down Millie but latter considers her partner in the restaurant business as a lover if things don't work out with her new husband(her ex-brother in law) unfortunate this is the same way it was with his first wife, Millie so out of one hole into another( same o same o). Not really about lesbians but about life as we know it. good for you."
5,The funeral is coming thru!,"What do u say about Rose Funeral except brutal as hell. This album is one of my favorites. I play it all the time. Call them death metal,death core whatever this cd pounds u to death from start to finish. If u are not one of the faithful reveiwers on here that nit picks everything to death then buy this cd."
1,hated it ...,slow .. tedious ... overly self-centered...dull characters .. no message ... interaction between characters quite forced and unnatural... choppy plot that has each scene feel like it is from a different movie .. characters were boring or annoying ... all of this equals one bad movie .. Julia Roberts .. Since winnnig that Oscar .. you have not been part of even one good movie .. What gives? A fan of yours so how about a come back where you do normal romance movies ...??
2,Did they run out of time at the end?,"When we finished this movie, my husband turned to me and said ""I (expletive) hated that movie."" I understood the reason why. The movie could have been pretty good but it ended up being extremely frustrating because it didn't explain things and then it had a really lame, unrealistic ending. Throw in some random cruelty scenes such as blowing fish up with fireworks, smashing fireflies with tennis rackets (showing kids how to do both) and a completely unrealistic sex scene. There was a shift in one character's demeanor that was very drastic and never explained. We kept waiting for them to explain how she went from one personality to a complete opposite personality...they never did and so that change never made sense, just was very confusing. I'd skip this one."
2,"Too many ""stars"", not enough film, stupid ending!","Fireflies is another one of those ensemble films with too many ""stars"" and not enough development. Actually, this could've been a good movie if it were longer and could've fleshed out the characters better. I suspect overly severe editing was a major culprit here.Ryan Reynolds has little screen ""presence"", and designated sk*nk, Carrie Moss, could've easily been cut from the film, but the rest of the cast were very good, in roles mostly too lean to satisfy.Finally a stupid ending robs the viewer of the much anticipated justice (for the despicable abusive father)."
4,"excellent cast, good movie","This is the type of movie they don't make anymore. It reminded me of something from the 1980s which is probably why I liked it. I tend to live in the past preferring old music and books and movies that take place (paritally or completely) in the past. I really liked this movie. I have read reviews on here of most people hating this. While I didn't read the entire review, I would bet that they hate it for the same reason that I like it. This could have been made 20 years ago and it would have been a big hit. Julia Roberts probably would have been in it even then. This movie obviously is not for everyone.Definitely, Maybe (Widescreen)Sleeping With the Enemy / Dying Young"
2,A very unlikeable bunch,"You probably won't really like or identify with any of the characters in this old-fashioned family drama of dysfunction behind the normal facade. No one really rings all that true, either. So, you're left to wade through the film-making technique, which relies on a lot of time-shifting and flashbacks that become a bit confusing because they are so short and frequent. It takes awhile before it dawns on you who is who here besides the evil dad, Willem DaFoe, who looks the same in flashback and today. Julia Roberts doesn't have much to do, either, as the long-suffering mom who looks the other way at her husband's child abuse. You also won't care for scenes of fish being blown up with fire-crackers. All in all, this 2012 movie is not likely to win a big audience."
2,Overwrought,reminded me of an ABC after school special with ryan reynolds being especially grating. the writer/director should have never let the screenplay see the light of day and left it as a purging/forgivness exercice.
1,disappointed...,really disappointed with this movie...wish I had rented it instead of buying it...probably won't watch it again...will probably sell it or give it away.
2,How can a movie with such a great cast and acting be so emotionless and boring? I wish I knew why. I say C+,"""If you don't know how to take care of something you don't deserve to have it."" When Michael (Reynolds) comes home for his mother Lisa's (Roberts) graduation the family is rocked by a tragedy. The family is now forced to live together in close confines and old and new problems begin to come to the surface. This is a very difficult movie to review. The acting is amazing. Every single person does a fantastic job throughout. The story is a little overused but still is a great idea. The glaring problem is that there is absolutely no personal connection to the characters and that really hurts the movie. I don't think that that is the actor's fault but when these awful things happen it doesn't affect you the way it's meant to. Overall, a good movie that doesn't create the effect that it was supposed to. I give it a C+."
1,Fireflies In the Garden,This movie is a dark drama it's mostly sad the family is totally disfunctional and the child is mentally and emotionally abused throughout his childhood and even as an adult he is still dealing with his dark past. This is a drama that starts off bad and even at the end it is still no real family connections the whole family seems afraid to express themselves even the cousin got dragged in on it and it seems as if she is still passing the behavior off to her kids. This is not what I expected from Julia Roberts she is one of my favorites.
2,"Deception, kind of. Never able to View the DVD i purchased",This DVD is not compatible in the US. i am still trying to return it. This is a movie i have been attempting to see for a good 7 months. When i ordered it on Amazon i was not aware it did not work in US DVD players. Still trying to find out how to return it.It would be nice to locate this movie in US Format. Discouraging to say the least
3,Nice film,"""NICE"" is all I can say, it was too much like my own life. My relationship with dad was bad, and it was slow man the camera men had to have fallen alseep during this film. I don't understand who brings together all these good actors and than makes a sleepy long boring film. I don't get it. Is everyone on WEED and its slows them all down and makes the obvious - not so obvious... that being Dang, this is one slow moving boring script. Bring new writers by way of opening to new Authors and New Script people.... time fo rchange hollywood is in big doo-doo.... movies are getting wrose. Will we have to start importing movies from China next too???"
5,Fireflies In the Garden,"Great cast of characters and found it intersting that Julia Roberts had such a short but powerful role. Wilem Dafoe has always been an actor I enjoyed, but that character he played, (WOW), be nice now. I felt that Ryan Reynolds' was exceptional. Hayden Pattinere, Carrie-Ann Moss and Emily Watson, completed the movie as well."
4,good movie,I thouhgt it was a very good movie. but not for everyone.... it is a bit sad at points so saps beware lol... great cast and a good story line i would watch it again....
5,The best Nelson CD of all time!,"Bill Nelson, has created a masterpeice with this CD. An unforgetable listen.. I mean it goes from great song..to great song..to great song. including songs such as Don't Touch Me (I'm electric), Build a better Home in The Phantom Zone, Stop/Go/Stop, Furniture Music/ Art/Empire/Industry..I think I just mentioned half the LP, proving my point farther that this is with no doubt the best album of all time. there is nothing like it..and then add Bill Nelson's great guitaring and it's considered a masterpiece. (I have the lyrics off the Vinyl too!!!)"
4,"Post BBD, pre solo work","Bill Nelson's Red Noise was a strange experiment in post nu-wave/punk/glam rock. But for an album over twenty years old, it stands up well. Nowhere near as melodic as Be Bop, it's very harsh sounding, angry album which harkens back to the George Orwell ""Big Brother"" time. I can not recommend this album enough for any fan of Bill Nelson's earlier or laterr work."
4,Brave New Fascism for Youth,"Hyper kinetic, wrist slashing, nerve twitching music that is almost too painful to listen to. A futuristic manifesto for a bleak world beyond the solace of god, that enjoys the heady language of fascism and youth. Thank god this world doesn't exist. The music is the dire prediction of Bill Nelson reading too many artsy sci-fi political tracts from the 30s & 40s. This vision takes new wave music to even a newer wave of intensity -- put The Cars music into a blender at top speed, add a totalitarian touch of nihilism, quirk and angst, and you get the Orwellian art of the automaton. Everything bends to this world... except God."
2,Bill Nelson goes new wave.,"When you put it in the context of the dawn of the new wave movement of the late seventies/early eighties, this recording is not without merit as it is ahead, slightly, of it's time. When you compare it to the Be Bop Deluxe catalogue it pales considerably. As with most of Nelson's work it is clever and inventive. Unfortunately, it is also extremely hyper-active. Too much so, as the pace spoils what could have been interesting cuts. Nelson also abandons his guitar god throne on this outing avoiding guitar solos entirely. Stick with Be Bop Deluxe, particularly Sunburst Finish, Modern Music, Live in the Air Age and Futurama. Give this one a pass....Simon"
5,Me like,Having listened to this LP cassette cd a bunch of times since 1980 or so I have come to the conclusion that Mr. Nelson (not Sir Bill yet?) was writing march tunes in this phase of his career.Picture if you will the USC Trojan Marching Band playing Art/Empire/Industry during halftime of the Oregon Ducks game.Go ahead.Try it.
4,SOS Review,"Nelson sounds like he's doing Devo at times on this album. Overall I enjoy it very much. I recommend this to people that like new wave progressive stuff from the late 70s to early 80s. Once again the everchanging Nelson is brilliant on this disc. I'm a BeBop Deluxe fan from the 70s, so I tend to favor Nelsons' work."
5,Over the top outrageously delicious,"I'm gonna go back to my grocer's and buy every jar of this spicy pizza topping they have in stock. I made the most fantastic penna pasta with this topping & I've added it to my sub sandwiches--it is truly great stuff--I hope they never stop making it. It's a little on the spicy hot side, but not too hot! Try it--you'll love it too! Thanks puckeredpickle for making such a divinely delicious delight such as this!"
5,The tools i need for my souls redemption,"I know my souls- emotions, will mind- must be renewed. This book gave me an understand why my thoughts must be renewed and the very ""simple"" tool is the WATER of the woord. As easy as that?"
4,fila watch,great deal!But Nobody tells me that in the price of the sendings doesn't include the borders taxs
4,Wonderfully Uplifting,"I find this album, and all the songs on it, infused with happiness, and the album makes me smile within seconds of hitting play. The songs are upbeat, with great beats, wonderful multi-part singing, and a kind of African - Carribean feel to them.I highly recommend this CD, I think it's great."
1,Overpriced and little info,This is another horrible book by Andrew Martin. He tries to insert his British humour in this book and it doesn't work. It's so confusing and hard to understand. The lines are not deep enough. Don't buy this one. Try another author.
5,Feather Fall started me on a venture into Africa.,"A friend gave me Feather Fall for Christmas two years ago, thinking I would enjoy reading it. For some reason I put it on the shelf and forgot about it for several months. When I picked it up and started reading it, I called her to say what a fantastic book and that she must read it! Since then I have been trying to read everything by and about Laurens van der Post. He has led me into a discovery of the people and geography of South Africa, but more importantly has helped me on my spiritual journal."
4,Very Moving !,"I purchased (on impulse) at same time as ordering another video (Ben's Vortex) from Robert and Jill. It just caught my eye and I enjoyed it almost as much as the other! Completely different subject matter, but will now give careful thoguht on ordering more of their offerings and consider purchasing anything new coming out!!!"
3,Good book,"For how old this book is, it's still pretty good. If your using anything higher than Maya 7, then you would rarely use this book. If your using Maya 7, this book is decent. Some areas are hard to follow though."
3,Description a little off: PLE not included,"At the time of my order, the web description said,""The companion DVD includes instructor-led tutorials, scene files, artist interviews, and Maya PLE.""But the back of the book I received said,""What you will need to use this book: * Maya Complete 7 or Maya Personal Learning Edition.""And I did not see Maya PLE on the included DVD.This disappointed me, since I was looking forward to using Maya 7 PLE on my computer, since my older PC does not run May 2010 PLE.Friendly Amazon representatives have let me return it twice. Both times the book had a DVD without Maya PLE.The book looks understandable and I would enjoy it if I already had Maya."
