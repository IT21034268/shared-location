2,Strange Imagery for Sleep,"I have all 4 CDs in this series and I just find this one odd to try to use for bed time. For me, the imagery starts out fine, floating like a feather, clouds, scan for stress. Then, the journey changes into something almost medical. For me, mentaly examining all the details of my feet, then muscles, tendons, bones, marrow, atoms is not really relaxing bedtime material.The music is mostly nice except for some human voice inserts that don't seem to fit to me and add a lot of distraction.This might be a fun trip at a different time of day or if you have different goals, but for me, just not right for bed time."
1,should be marketed as a fairy tale,"This book was nice in the past where most customers were at least there to be served. However, in a time when freebies and getting one over on the man has become an admireable atribute the ideas expressed are only good for a nostalgic look at how I might have wanted my business to be years ago. For todays business world of satisfying customers while keeping things like shrinkage down this book really is not much more than a fairy tale."
4,Not bad,"The person who posted that it was a group effort on the behalf of members of an anti-customer website to attack this book is correct. I know this because I was a member of the website but left in dsigust. What happened was that someone read this book at work and then posted stories about it at the website. Many members, who hadn't read it, decided to come here to amazon and give the book a bad rating. Pretty pathetic in my opinion because you can be darn sure those same people would have been mad as heck if a bunch of ""Customers"" trashed a book that was written from the employee's perspective. Anyway, on to this book: its OK. I don't agree with a lot of what the author says but its good to read just to pick up some pointers on providing good customer service. You basically have to pick out whats good and whats rather obnoxious and unrealistic. Thats my opinion!"
1,"Sadly, this isn't meant to be funny",Some of the stories in this book are just insane. A restaurant you've been going to for years one day charges 5 cents for a pickle and all of a sudden you stop going? What a loser.
1,Only a complete loser would come up with a book like this.,"If there was a way to give this book a ZERO,I'd have done it. One more time, folks,all together now: the customer is NOTalways right, they're usually full of ****!"
1,There are many great management books in the world...,"...but this isn't one of them.If you want to send your business down the drain, then read this book.If you want all your staff to quit or go 'postal' because you treat them like garbage and allow people to abuse them, then read this book.If you have no idea that what it takes to run a successful business is hard work and not inane aphorisms, then read this book.If, on the other hand, you want to run a successful business, then buy something else and avoid insipid tripe like this."
1,The Worst customer service book ever!!,"In almost all his examples, the customer was wrong. managers and owners who take farrell's advice deserve to go out of business. his advice is essentailly do anything to humiliate the employees if that's what it takes to keep the unimaginably obnoxious customers happy. if waiter threw a dollar tip in the face of a party of 20, meaning that the waiter worked all evening for free, i would NEVER reward that customer with a gift certificate.good employees are harder to come by than customers."
1,One word describes this book...Garbage!,"I also agree with the other reviewers, if I could possibly rate this book any lower I would. How can anyone be proud of something like this. Here's his point of view summed up.Retail workers are lower forms of life. They have no dignity and deserve no respect.Just about every customer mentioned in this book was out of line and should have been thrown out of the establishment.The customer is not always right. You give respect and you get respect back."
1,Doesn't Deserve Any Stars,The customers in the stories were way out of line. Encouraging people to behave in that manner is just disgraceful. Businesses have policies for a reason. Just because the customer wants something does NOT mean they should get it.
1,This Book is Absolutely Terrible,"Anybody who buys this book is wasting their money. There are plenty of good customer service books out there, this one is bogus. The author assumes that all retail associates are idiots and every customer is a saint. In reality, there are many customers that are not always right, in fact many are dead wrong.Mr. Farrell has apparently never worked with or dealt with difficult customers, otherwise, this book would never have been written. Folks, save your money."
1,Someone needs to get a clue,"Obviously many people who have never worked a day with customers will LOVE this book. It gives them an excuse to be a jerk to every employee out there. Don't let me sit where I want to in your eating establishment? Fine, i will sit there anyway and order a pizza, just to prove what a pompous idiot I can be! The reason so many people complain of the downfall of customer service is because of this gentleman. Tell me this, who in their right mind, would want to serve a demanding, rude, complaining customer? NO ONE! Lets quit talking about the decline of customer service, and begin talking about the uprise of rude uncaring consumers! I guarantee if anyone wrote a book about that, every customer service employee would buy it!"
1,Bad Advice,"I don't believe the advice this guy gives. It is totally unrealistic. Everyone deserves respect and this book is basically instructing customers to treat service indusrty employees like crap. I gave this 1 star and I feel like that was too high, unfotunately it was the lowest option available."
1,This is just evil!,"I agree with the other reviewer who said one star was far too many. It's obvious the author never had to work directly with the customers, or he'd be singing a much different tune. I agree that customers deserve respect -- as long as they're willing to give it in return. Some people fail to realize that respect is a two-way street, and if you're not willing to give it, you don't deserve it.People like him are the reason I got out of retail 14 years ago. I've personally been yelled at because of the prices going up, the store discontinuing an item, and other things that as a lowly employee, were beyond my control. I've seen customers steal, lie to get something they weren't entitled to, and even threaten the employees. But I guess that's all OK, because the customer's always right.I'd love to see this guy behind a cash register, a service desk, or on a sales floor. He wouldn't last a week."
1,This just angered me greatly!,"Where do I begin to express the contempt in which I hold this book? If the authors truely believe the rubbish they spew forth, then they obviously have never done a days work on the front line in their life. Their book condones irrational and argumentative behaviour on the side of the customer, something we employees have to deal with all too often. To expect an employee to have to get walked all over with a smile on their face is just plain wrong. The customer is not always right and they most certainly are not the boss."
1,1 star is too many for this one,"Businesses do not need a manual on how to give good customer service. Customers need a manual on how to be good customers! The $1 tip story was horrible. I would've thrown that ""tip"" back at the party too. And the person that said the customer is NOT always right, was definitely correct. It is often used when the customer is not getting the answers they want to hear. Can't live with store policies? Too bad, too sad. There are policies for a reason, mostly to stop scammers and to keep prices from inflating."
4,Hardware mode programming still buggy,"I got this to simplify the filling out of forms on a computer that can't install any thing on. I have and only plan to use it in hardware mode. So far I have 1 button set up to fill out most of 1 form that I need to do every day. Still talking to the makers about the mouse movements that are not working but overall I am happy with the 1 button. With 1 button I am able to select the form and have it put in the 11 N's in all the correct places, put in my truck number and move the curser to the empty field where I need to add more info. If i ever need to change trucks all I have to do is edit my truck number on my computer and save it on xkey. It's a little expensive for what I am using it for but its beats dealing with the built in mini keyboard on the computer and 4"" x 6"" touch screen."
5,A Basic Book,"George Martin's ""Opera Companion"" is a basic book that should be at hand for any opera-goer, beginner or veteran, curious or knowledgeable. I cannot imagine a better introduction to the joys, complexities, and byways of opera. It is only improved by Martin's writing, which is clear, warm, and witty.The generous second half of the book contains synopses of forty-six operas, both well-known and seldom encountered. They are especially good because Martin provides ""signposts"" for listening by giving the incipits of sung texts in the original language and English, along with pronunciations. They are an enormous help in keeping oriented as you listen to a broadcast or recording."
1,Buyer beware: Inaccurate title and description,"The title of this DVD is actually Total Body Training PILATES. It appears to be a reissue of a 2002 video. (I really hate it when companies re-issue exercise videos without properly identifying them as such.) The Amazon description does not mention that you need a ""resist-a-ring"" and that it's a PILATES routine--a big omission if you're not interested in pilates!"
5,Excellent Workout and Instructor,"I got this DVD several years ago with the two workout. The pilates with the ring teach you how to breath and squeeze your abdominal in, to obtain optimal results, but also is excellent for the inner thigt. If you are new in the beginning is hard but as Karen Voight said be patient and do it again until you develop strength to reach the results that you are looking for.The back and abdominal workout is excellent if you have pain in the middle back help you to overcome the pain and I believe give some healing in the muscle at least that happen to me years ago. The workout is not for beginners, but is not advance either.Now I am buying my second DVD because the old one is getting wore out. At the present, I use it in my easy day, before was one of my hard ones."
2,Great workout but not quite what I was looking for ...,"This is a great video and very useful. When you master these exercises, it will be your day! But unless you are two strokes from being a fitness freak, try something else.I bought this for my wife and she likes the intensity but after about three times, the interest was lost largely due to the fact that you MUST have the squeeze thingy. Yes you can do the workout without it but it's pretty senseless to do that.And then you get the squeezy thingy and you realise this is advanced stuff! Really hard so if you like intense workout and you know you gonna stick at it ... this is the right item for you. If you gonna quit easy for something less stressful, please avoid like the plague!"
4,Yemonja Maternal Divinity,"There aren't many books about Yeye Yemoja but this is a very good book to have because of the number of ese / pataki (stories) pertaining to this Great Orisa and her relationships with the other Orisa. If you are familiar with the attributes of Yemoja then you'll enjoy reading how she interacts with other Orisa,and her sense of problem solving found in a few of these stories. Initiates & seasoned practitioners will quickly notice within these stories the source of some of the taboos and practices associated not only with Yemoja but other Orisa as well. I hope these authors produce more good works on the Mother of Fishes Yeye mi Yemoja."
4,Nice and Decent looking watch,"I bought this for 49.99 from Amazon and its truly value for money. Very good styling , nice bracelet. Overall its a very good buy."
3,Typo on first page?,"Anyone else disappointed that a glaring typo appears on the very first page of the book? He resigned in 1879, not 1897."
1,Pre-Nazi blasphemous thinker,"Other than Karl Marx, I can not think of a more offensive nineteenth century writer. Unfortunately, like the writings of Marx, later generations bought into the sweet sound of the devil incarnate, and we ended up with the most murderess century in history. I would assert that these writings were in large part responsible for the moral degradation of Germany, transforming the free country that produced Bach, Beethoven, Mozart and Helmholtz to the nation of sheep that produced Otto von Bismark, monetary hyperinflation, and Adolf Hitler. Notice any parallels to America today? Make no mistake, Nietzsche had deep seated contempt for his fellow man. This was a very disturbed individual,a pre-nazi, and a pro new world order philosopher. You won't find inspiration, enlightenment, or the message of freedom in these toxic writings. Best to look elsewhere."
3,What can one say that can add to Nietzche?,"Obviously brilliant, some of his theories I'm not sure I can handle. His denial of free will, for one. What I find most interesting is the number of people who say they liked Thus spoke Zarathustra the best, probably unaware that when Nietzshe was speaking of the Higher Man he was adressing them. The higher man Nietzsche refers to is obviously Democratic man, or Modern man for which Nietchze has so much abuse."
2,Nietzsche was out there a ways,"I have alot of respect for Nietzsche, he was brilliant in his own right and he also helped Freud in some of the formulation of psychoanalysis. But Nietzsche ended up in a mental hospital, and had emotional and mental problems in his later life....and his philosophies and views of life were certainly influenced by his own sadness and despair. Anyway, the book was disapointing and hard to read."
1,Awful. Don't read. Not worth your time.,"This book (or rather, books) was written by a very angry, disillusioned person whose pedantic and purposefully convoluted Siddhartha-like writing style hides the fact (none too successfully) that he has nothing worthwhile to say.He also loathes religion with a passion and might possibly like to see all religious people burn in hell--if he believed in hell.Not at all edifying or useful except perhaps as a paperweight. Definitely not worth your time."
5,Great,"A great translation of a great man. I would definitly recommend this book for someone getting into Nietzsche. It has his great works (The Antichrist being my favorite), as well as excerpts from other's. Best if followed by Kaufmann's Nietzsche - Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist."
4,Good Introductory,"Book provides a good overview of some the most current design concepts. Would help though if the book provided more applications or examples or in-depth treatment of areas such as Concept Selection, QFD, Axiomatic Design, TRIZ, etc. within the framework of a phase-gate development process. In general, I find the book to be a good introductory text on product design concepts and tools ... Other text on DFSS could serve as complementary reading ..."
2,"Not a good intro to the Blues, especially for an acoustic guitar player","I was excited about this book after reading the publicity but the book disappoints. It has very little about acoustic guitar and concentrates instead on heavy metal stuff. Great book if you're 13 and just starting up a rock band, I suppose, but it has none of the history, culture, personalities or understanding of the genre that other books have.I'd skip over it."
1,Major disappointment,"This picture frame seemed to have all the right stuff: high resolution and all the features I wanted. But I guess I got a 'lemon' because it was virtually dead on arrival! I was able to copy a few of our own pictures to the internal memory and it ran fine....for about half an hour. The screen then filled up with 'bars', so I turned the unit off, hoping to reset it. It did not come back on...no boot screen, nothing, zip, nada...it died. I'm sending it back."
2,"No USB cable, no instructions, marginal quality, $100...meh...I could have done better. So could you.","For $100 I'd expect there to be instructions and a compatible USB cable...Lame! The transitions appear pixillated, hokey, and way web 1.0 with no ability to control that. Simple fade-in, fade-out of the images would have been a better default."
1,Disappointed,"It looks great, the quality of the picture was very good. However, it didn't perform as it should have. The pictures would hang up and would not cycle through. It also had a stutter every now and then where the picture would have a flash. It would occasionally turn a picture sideways. I was happy with the delivery of the product and the return procedure. We purchased another brand that was cheaper and it occasionally turns a picture sideways also, but eventually will turn it back, so I guess the technology on the digital frames could use a little sweaking in my experience."
4,Good Digital Picture Frame,"It's a good basic digital picture frame. It's well packed in the box and looks to be well build. Preforms as described with two caveats.First they don't include the USB cable. This isn't a big deal for me as I have several laying around from other items but it is a big deal for my grandmother who isn't known for having extra USB cords at her house...Second you only get once picture source at a time. If you are using the internal memory you can only use internal memory, if you are using a SD card you can only use the SD card slot.Neither are a huge deal, just something to know going in."
1,Disappointment,"I purchased this product for my wife for Christmas. The 128MB internal drive turned out to be a 15MB flash drive, so I was unable to load but a few pics on it. There was also 2 red pixels on the screen. This product was defective out of the box and had the wrong drive in it. I have yet to hear back from 47th Street Photo on this and it's been a week. Needless to say, I'm not happy."
1,Bummer.,Very very disappointing . It will not fit any of our 3 vehicles. It is way to small. Do. Of buy this product.
2,Not so good,"We purchased this grill based on the reviews here at Amazon and other publications. When I recieved the grill my first impression was the size. This grill is small. The cooking area is 14-1/2""x 9"".The grill does heat up quickly, but, the temperature swings greatly as the thermostat cycles. From observing a small surface thermometer, I estimate a 40 deg F swing.Lastly, the temperature settings seem odd. For example, I cook bacon on a ""High"" setting. The surface thermometer indicated 200 to 240 deg F. Cleaning the connections between the grill and thermostat had no affect.As far as cleaning the grill afterward, I can say this grill is more difficult to clean than my previous one. This one is heavy and awkward in the sink.This grill replaced a Presto from Target. It cost less than half of the Bonjour, yes it had hot spots but temp was consistent.Now, this grill, the Bonjour, is being replaced with another Presto.To be fair to those who love this grill, I have not tried warranty solutions."
4,All's Good,"I wanted this book to complete the seriesI liked the others in the series as enjoyable light reading while travelling. this book followed the same line and was enjoyable, I will not go into details of character or plot as I do not like these types of essay reveiws as then you know what is happening and is pointless to read the bookI also recommend the prompt service received from Amazon and the seller"
1,high-impact nothing,"When closing price goes up N times, buy. When it goes down N times, sell. Exit when profitable enough. If exited too early, re-enter. Use stops. Different markets are profitable in different time frames, from one-minute to hourly bars. This strategy is very profitable and has been tested on one month of data. If this sounds interesting - buy this book.Alternatively, read this review again and implement it in your trading."
4,Original thinking!,I used the system outlined in the book to develop a highly successful longer term system that makes very good returns with low drawdowns. It also recovers very quickly from losses. Enough said!
5,Peach DVD is the new age in Digital Erotica,Three full-length titles from Peach DVD's top selling Interactive series.Play a game of chance when you offer your guests three treat options as they come to greet you at your new manor.Spy on the all girl party as a special viewing option in Girls Night In.Explore the decadent adventure of Invitation Only as three different characters with three different perspectives and outcomes.Three good examples of why Peach DVD is the new age in Digital Erotica.
5,Tha Truth iz they are Tha Bomb!,Ahh the good ole days ..this album takes me back to my clubbin days the record is off the hook every song is great to bad tha truth did'nt get the noteriety they so deserved.Where are you girls?Please anyone with info one there wherabouts please respond...This album is tha bomb...
5,Great Hat!,"I love this hat. I found a similar one elsewhere for three times the price, but this one is even better. Plus when I ordered, I was told that it would ship on Feb 13, but I received it Feb 5!! Great job on the quality of the hat and the customer service."
3,very cute..but too big,unfortunately i had to return this really super cute hat because it was way too big. you'd think it would be smaller since it's very girly. but the top part just makes it look very unsexy. =(
4,Delicious...,"This book will thrill you, chill you & fulfill you! This is where Rocky Horror all began. A blonde Dr. Frank-N-Furter, Eddie popping out of a Coca-Cola ice box...nothing better!Buy it if your a Rocky Horror freak like me."
4,Not surprising at all...,"Naturally, everybody's copy of this REPRINT has the front page signed by Richard O'Brien ""to Chris with love Richard"" and is similarly #27 of the original Limited Edition of 2000. That's the copy that Christopher Malcolm (original London stage Brad) received from Richard O'Brien, and since they apparently couldn't find the original scrapbook they used his copy as the basis for the reprint."
3,Wrong artist,"This CD is often marked as ""Herbert"" (Matthew Herbert's) new release, but it's not, do not be mislead. Rate is just a middle, try for yourself, samles can be found on other sites."
5,Magic Happens!,"Folk rockers from the sixties have set new standards and blazed many musical trails that have withstood the tests of time. The Byrds, Turtles, Mamas & Papas as well as the Lovin' Spoonful left indelible marks in music and in the minds, memories and lives of their countless delighted listeners.1965 was a banner year for music. In addition to the Beatles, et al. from the United Kingdom, the Folk Rockers in America such as the ones listed above set their own special stamp on music. The title track ""Do You Believe in Magic"" is a fun, light-hearted song that is just plain feel good. I love it! Sebastian, et al. are virtuosos at creating a ""feel good"" atmosphere and incorporating a delightful blend of country into many of their songs. The result is a musical tapestry of folk, country and rock!"
5,Lookin' good,Bought the waterproof pencil for vacation. Love how it goes on and also the fact that it stays on. I went with the blond and would recommend a lighter color even for darker hair.
4,Informative Book,"I took a public speech class in college and this book was required. It wasn't too difficult to read. I think the reading level is middle school or early high school. Anyone who graduated from high school should be able to read this book no problem. I don't have any strong negative or positive comments to highlight, but I will say that this book is not bad at all. It can hold your attention if you have trouble reading school assigned books. I can't give a comparison though because this is the only speech book I've ever read!"
2,Product not as described,"The book that popped up when I searched this title turned out to be an older edition which di not have all the materials with it. Since I was intending to use it as a text for a course, it did not meet my needs and I had to return it."
5,Publick Speaking 8th ed.,"The book was shipped and recieved very quickly. The condition was exactly the same as stated. I purchases 8th ed. even though I was supposed to get the 9th ed. for school, but my proffesor asaid that they are the same book so I went for this extremely cheap textbook."
2,Useless on a Corolla,"They only fit speakers 5.25"". 6.5"" wont fit the basket. Corolla will swallow a 6.75"" mounted to a hollowed-out stock driver. That's right, just punch out the stock speaker cone completely then use that frame to mount a 6.5/6.75"" speaker directly into. If you read this right, you'll realize you do NOT need this product. I had to learn this the hard way so hopefully this will help someone !"
3,6.5 inch speakers don't fit,These fit on 2005 Prius but many aftermarket 6.5 speakers don't fit in them. There may be some 6.5 speakers that could fit if the body of the speaker is quite a bit narrower than the speaker ring. The diameter of the hole is 5 inches. They'll probably work with the type of 5.25 speakers that have screw tabs which extend out about half inch.
1,Disappointed with the disc not the music,"Just a quick note,I have had the DVD of this show for a while and love the performance. I was very excited to see the Blu-ray version was coming but when I received the disc I was really disappointed. The audio/video is not synched. The audio is about a half second behind what is going on visually. I returned the disc. I hope they correct this and re-release the Blu-ray version."
5,Served it's purpose!,"I have an old estate by whirlpool washing machine that had stopped spinning. I looked up that the motor coupling was the most common cause for that issue. I found this on Amazon for a reasonable price and no shipping charge. It said the standard shipping would take 3-5 days but showed up on my doorstep in 2 days. After I took my washer apart, I saw that the old motor coupling was broken and the new one fit perfectly in it's place. The new one has been on there for a month now and has not caused any issues. Calling the appliance would've taken him over a week to fix and would've cost me $70!"
3,Not quite the item that was pictured when I ordered it.,"When I ordered this item the picture was of the new style.That has the metal insert.I was supprised at what came.It works, but not what I thought I was getting."
3,Not an OEM Whirlpool part as listed...,"This part is listed as made by Whirlpool. The part I received was not made by Whirlpool. If you want the OEM, FSP Whirlpool part like I did, you may want to contact the seller first. I did install the part and it did fit and work OK. Time will tell about the quality."
5,Great service!,"I received the item very quickly, perfectly packaged, no problems. Very very efficient! Just the way you want it when you order on-line. No hassles."
1,Coupling Stripped after 4 Months,"Bought this product in August, and on December, the metal insert inside the coupling was stripped. I am glad that the coupling failed first instead of striping the motor shaft (from what I hear cost a lot more than a $4 part).I will instead go with the all plastic piece (285753 *no A) which is similar to the original that lasted 10 years."
5,Whirlpool didn't whirl,"Our 10 year old machine would not spin the water out. Several web sites were very helpful in narrowing the problem to a specific part. I ordered the part from Amazon whose vendor offered free shipping on a very inexpensive part. I was amazed to receive it in about 2 days, and immediately installed it according to easy videos I also found on the web. I did not even have to pull the machine from the wall, the cabinet removes from the front with 2 screws and 2 clips. Wow! I had the machine working again perfectly after less than 30 minutes work and less than a few bucks."
3,part came in great shape and worked well on instalation in my washer I hope it lasts as long as the original,part was as advertised and delivered in new condition. worked great. I hope it lasts as long as the original.
1,Wrong product supplied,"I specifically searched and selected this product with the metal insert. I bought one coupling with a metal insert and one without. I was supplied two couplings, both without metal inserts."
5,Excellent product,Shipped fast and product was just as described. It fit perfectly and I haven't had any problems since. Don't worry about getting the metal sleeved one as if something happens this one will break like its supposed to do rather than messing up your machine
5,whirlpool washer motor coupling,This part was exactly what we needed for less than half of the retail price. It was shipped in a very timely manner and was received in perfect condition. Highly recommended.
5,awesome talent,I have this CD plus 6 other great ones from a very unassuming talent..Danny Wright. He is a most fluid and emotionally talented pianist.and can breathe new life in many popular works. I am in awe of his God-given talent and feel he is so much better than more commercial oriented pianists....This man is a rareity and I urge more people to sit back with a good wine and listento a man who can speak to your soul with his music.
4,This cd is W-R-I-G-H-T on,"I always knew that Danny had the talent to proivide a great performance. With this cd that day has come. Danny has given us perhaps his best effort yet.This is a cd that romantic piano lovers will cherish forever. It is one of a few solo piano cds that I truely love and love and love. You will too, once you hear these gems played by Danny.I do wish more pianist would offer us, the fans, this kind of music with these beautiful performances.If you will allow me to, i'm going to recommend this cd to you and you and you."
1,This cd is W-R-O-N-G,"I always knew that Danny had the lowlifeness to proivide a lousy performance. With this cd that day has come. Danny has given us perhaps his worst effort yet.This is a cd that has Unromantic piano crud. Romantic people will hate thsi forever! It is one of a few solo piano cds that I truely hate and hate and hate. You will too, once you hear these pieces of tird played by Danny.I do wish more pianists would learn from this disaster, the pain of listeing to this is unbearable, this kind of music with these hideous performances could put you to sleep from boredom.If you will allow me to, i'm going to recommend that you flush this cd down your toilet. Skip thsi one, I threw mine in my waste basket. I wouldn't even give this tio my worst enemy."
3,"Stevie Nicks Got ""Rhiannon"" from this book","The only reason I ordered this book, is Stevie Nicks, of Fleetwood Mac, mentioned it was her inspiration for her great ""Rhiannon"" song...The book, itself, is ok, but I wouldn't brag about it or recommend it.You can get a good used price on it, so worth the price, if you are a curious Stevie fan :)"
3,good book,this bok was ok. very old but the principle still applies to our present. it stresses the importance of perseverance and gives examples. its a short read and just reminds you that u can do anything u set ur mind to.
4,Comments,"There is no nudity whatsoever in this collection of Gicl'e, grayscale, digital prints of male students in their school clothes at the above high school, which happens to be located next door to the publisher. The subjects are of various races and many photo's are engaging to different degrees. A couple guys look pretty sharp in their ROTC uniforms; otherwise, there are plenty of jeans and tee shirts. There is no text once the plates begin until a checklist at the end, etc.; there is also no color. Most are portraits, but these are not yearbook pictures; the students are often seen overall in the hall, etc., alone or with others. The few smiles indicate that the students were not told to say ""cheese"". They do not have much to smile about in a town where the largest-employing auto plants have closed. Reminds me of the bumper sticker, ""Hungry? Eat your Toyota!"""
2,Misrepresented publication date,"Although this book is listed as published in 2009, it was actually published by World Book Company in 1914. It is a set of reprints from the University of Michigan Library archives. The author, Robert Clute was formerly an instructor in agriculture at the Philippine Normal School. This information is on the title page, not on the book cover. Was it misrepresented ?- YES. Is it worth buying? - Only if you are interested in a historical book. I guess it will become part of my archives now."
2,Not what I expected,"Im not sure why, but this Cerama Bryte Spray doesnt work nearly as good as the wipes. It goes on unevenly and runs down the appliance no matter how light I try to apply it.Im going to stick with the wipes.."
2,Should Have Been a Thesis,"Faulkner has always been an interesting American writer. He was complicated, lazy, unfocused, egocentric, and at times, absolutely brilliant. But Mr. Minter has an overlycomplicated writing style that tends to include too many literary comparisons most readers may not be familiar with. He also has a way of dancing around the topic a little too much for my tastes and makes the book a less enjoyable read than it should be. I would have enjoyed a book that was more to the point and not something that reads like an attention starved graduate student's thesis."
5,The Only Book of Its Kind!,"Extraterrestrial Archaeology by Childress is the only book of its kind! It is the only book that I know of that has large format photos of the so-called structures on the Moon. Other books, such as SOMEBODY ELSE IS ON THE MOON by George Leonard or OUR MYSTERIOUS SPACESHIP MOON by Don Wilson are both long out of print. Childress has a run-down, with large illustrations of the various theories and evidence that the Moon is occupied, as well as other planets and moons in our solar system. This book will blow your mind, whether you are a skeptic or a believer!"
3,A little boring,"David Hatcher Childress documents some little known facts regarding the planets in our solar system and why there could very well have been life elsewhere besides earth. Largely based on photos taken by NASA and the Russians, Childress attempts to show the reader why he believes there are ruins on the other plants in our solar system. However he gets a little too in-depth which results in the book getting a little boring sometimes. Still a very interesting read."
2,It worked - for a while,"The cable was really cheap, but in the end it stopped working after a couple of weeks. I guess you really do get what you pay for. I bought another cable with metal connectors for $10 more and it is much better. Optical needs better connector alignment than you can get with plastic, at least on long (20'+) cables, I guess.A buddy of mine told me the internal light conductor can slip within the jacket after the cable gets unrolled and relaxes for a while, then the connector alignment gets messed up. Seems plausible, but I just threw out the cable rather than try to figure it out."
3,Media HARDWARE,"These did just what you want them to do, if you need this type of connection these will work just fine, solidly put together"
5,Best for fine hair,"My stylist introduced me to this product and I have been using it every since. I have fine hair that gets frizzy in the humdity. Since I can't find it in beauty supply stores or at salons, I have been ordering it from Amazon. YEAH! (We moved out of state). I couldn't take my stlyist with me, but at least I can still get my hair products!"
4,the best soundtrack i have ever heard.,you have to buy this you collecting of cds is in complete without this. this has some of the best bands i have ever heard.
2,Disappointed,"I ordered the CD, hoping for one particular cut from the movie, ""Boom Shak a Lak - Apache Indians"" and didn't get what I wanted. However, I do enjoy the version of ""Safety Dance"" that's here, so I've kept the CD."
3,Need the name of the song played in the movie... HELP,"What's the name of the band/song being played in the car, while bud and doyle are driving and spot the bio-dome ? I think the lyrics are something to the effect of "" Let's shoot the hole"" .. I could be wrong but it's been killing me ..."
4,Gogol-lite but good,"The Village of Stepanchikovo is indeed a very strange work for those familiar with Dostoevsky's works. His psychological novels inform our understanding of Russian society and, at the same time, his works transcend their cultural boundaries to reveal truths of human nature. One could go on and on about how great a writer Dostoevsky is. That being said, the Village of Stepanchikovo is an odd book indeed. One could consider this novel his homage to Gogol, a stab at comedy. Although not entirely successful in and of itself, the novel is an important early sketch, raw material to be used in building his masterpieces. In addition, the story moves at a great pace and is never boring. Overall, I found it to be quite entertaining. The novel probably is not a classic but rather quite an enjoyable story."
2,A very informal summary of BVI history,"Florence Lewisohn's book is a short and informal, albeit engaging, summary of BVI history. Her love of the islands and its people shines through her narrative, and even if the text is not the most authoritative, it makes an engaging read and not inaccurate summary of the key points of the Territory's past. For an informal summary, Ms Lewisohn's cites a fairly impressive bibliography at the back of the book, several of which seem to hae eluded later and more scholarly attempts to summarise the history of the British Virgin Islands."
1,Tastes Disgusting!!!,This stuff tastes so disgusting. It doesn't matter what you put it in or how diluted it is. The nasty taste is still present. I am ordering the capsule form immediately and ditching this stuff.
5,Reconcilable Differences by: Robert Cohen,"The book was in excellent condition when received and was shipped expediently. I haven't finished reading the book, therefore I cannot give a true review on the content, however I would purchase items from the seller again."
1,This book is garbage.,"Everyone in New York knows that Cohen is a sleazeball attorney who would do anything for a buck. Even worse, he is a chronic liar and it shows in the book. As an example, he suggest consulting lawyers to prevent problems, when lawyers often generate the problems to generate fees. The notion that he is capable to dispensing advice to anyone about human relations is laughable. The book is a must do not read."
5,Comfort Goodness,"I love this warm drink mix. Makes you want to snuggle up in front of a fire and just relax. The taste is blended so prefectly, many say it taste like drinking a warm gingerbread cake with whipped cream. I have to agree. Try it, you won't be sorry... I do use about 6oz of water verses the 8oz. I have this on AUTO SHIP what does that tell you.. :)Gloria from Ma"
4,A fine debut from an excellent New Jersey band.,"Flint Michigan's first CD is a really good set of rockers; some with a bit of a country feel, others more in the classic rock mold. Misdeeds Of The Wind is a churning, guitar driven rock song, with great lyrics. Space Aliens is a hoot. My only gripe - I've seen their live show, and the disk doesn't catch the energy the band has in performance. If you like guitar oriented rockers, check them out."
1,Broke While Installing,Bought for my 2001 Ford F-150 and the cover snapped in half during installation. Easy to install after it broke. Good luck.
5,Outstanding Picture Quality,"I've had this player for 9 months and have been very satisfied with its performance. For those that own an HDTV with an HDMI connection, this is a great alternative to the currently high-priced HD-DVD and Blu-ray players and provides a near-HD quality picture at a much lower price. I've compared this player's video output with cable HDTV broadcasts and the DVD picture quality is very close to actual HD.The player is connected to a 42"" Sony HD microdisplay with an HDMI cable. I've also connected a standard 480p player to the same TV using a component cable and the picture quality was far inferior compared with the HDMI connection. The HDMI cable I use is reasonably priced at around $20 and works very well. It isn't necessary to buy an overpriced and overhyped cable like Monster's.I'll eventually buy an HD player once the HD-DVD vs. Blu-ray issue is settled. I'm very happy with this player in the meantime."
4,If,"If you were designing the perfect CD/DVD player, this would not be it, but it is as close as you are likely to find."
5,"Good quality, yet reasonable priced.","This DVD player is great for series of TV shows or any movies that have multiple parts. You can watch the whole series without having to get up every hour to change the disk, definitely a plus for lazy people. Also, it has the HDMI feature which, if you have a HD TV then you can get a better picture. I recommend this DVD player."
3,Worked great... for 9 months.,"This DVD player would play the scratchiest disks no problem. We have always had issues with DVD players skipping and stalling (usually at the best part of the movie!) but this player played everything perfectly. After only 9 months, though, it won't play anything at all! It just sits there ""Loading"" and then goes through all of the DVD slots and finds them all ""Empty"". After doing some research online, this is apparently pretty common with this model.Extremely frustrating! This was Sony's last chance with me and they failed (unfortunately)."
3,A little less than what I expected from Sony,"I bought this because my home theater (Denon) came with a single play CD/DVD player, and I like to ""rack 'em"" while we're in the pool listening to CD's - so you don't have to come in every 50 minutes to change music. Also because of the silver finish, which complemented my current system. Very slow disc start up, no multi-disc shuffle as far as I can tell, and very average in every way. Great price, you can't beat it - however if you are serious about movies and music, I would buy something more expensive."
1,Worthless for shuffle playing CD's,This unit is worthless as a changer for CD's. It can only shuffle play songs on ONE cd. It will not shuffle play all songs on all CD's. It was returned.
5,Awesome product!,If I needed more I would buy this one again and again! I will certainly recommend this one to family & friends.
4,Instrumental tracks from the film,"If you liked this (now-dated) Woody Allen film and the rock n' roll of the time it was released, this recording will bring back amusing memories and a bit of nostalgia. I don't think any of these Lovin' Spoonful tracks made it to the playlists, but they are catchy, if a bit formulaic, rock n roll tunes. Fun."
5,Take the first step,"If you read this book, it will change your life. And not in any ""out there"" manner. I mean you will really find out how to fix your life. This book is more powerful than any twelve step program, and the fact that you learn from personal view points--what a great relief--I'm so tired of being preached at by male gurus!!!"
4,Luggage purchase,"I purchased this luggage for an extended stay in Asia. Since receiving it I have used the carry on for a weekend trip to Phoenix and the midsize for a week-long stay in the midwest. I was really thrilled to see how much room there was inside, and how light the cases really are. I was a little disappointed that it zipped instead of clamping, but I like the expandable feature. When I checked the bag this time, it came out unharmed from baggage. We'll see how it works when I start using foreign airlines. I am pleased with the product and the price and really enjoy the turquoise color I selected. It is easily identified at the airport."
3,guide on cut glass,"I wasnt really impressed with this book.I was because I am an amature when it comes to cut glass. I was disapointed because the pictures are like drawings, not actual pictures.I am happy however, because there is such a book on the market. the patterns are easy to compare and see whats what."
5,Very Satisfied,"Great album from start to finish. Candido plays conga in a Jazz idiom, this is not jazz latin or latin jazz, this is jazz with candido playing conga adapted to jazz which is great... and folks this is Candido Camero, what else can we expect? excellent and relaxing to listen to!"
4,EXCELLENT,"This is an excellent album, great percussion by Candido Camera, a mainstay in the 50's-early 60's on jazz recordings. Great accompaniment, this album swings bigtime. If you like jazz, you will likwe this CD."
4,"Inertia has good songs, and it plays well with what I'm doin","Inertia is for all different kinds of goups of people, and I like it alto, it the kind of band that has a wide variety, and you can never get sick of it."
3,Same Old Stuff,"I bought this cd just because I am a Billy Gilman fan and I collect all things Billy Gilman..My advice is to only buy this cd if you are just collecting Billy Gilman stuff. It has the same songs in the same form that are available on his first 2 cds. There is no difference. There is also no new pictures, the only picture of Billy on the whole thing is a photo of him from back in 2001 or so."
5,Billy Gilman My time on earth [cd],The Billy Gilman cd came within the time stated it would and in new condition.Being a Billy Gilman fan like I am this cd makes a great addition to my Gilman cd collection.I look forward to buying from this selling again.
5,Refreshing and Challenging,"I really enjoyed this book by Harvey Rich. He takes his experience with hundreds of people he has seen in his psychoanalytic practice and tries to describe what makes for people who know joy in their lives, and who can also accept adversity in their lives. He contrasts those who are too fragile for joy and who break in the face of adversity. He has done a good job of naming the steps to living a ""celebratory"" life and giving examples so that you and I can understand how we might begin to make a habit of these steps.Some people aren't going to ""get it."" They may be a little too far from living a celebratory life to grasp to concepts -- but most of us, who are doing okay but missing out on some of the joy that is waiting to be in our lives, will love this book."
1,It's a mystery....,"This book offers little to nothing. It is amazing how many times one can insert the word mystery and celebration into a single paragraph! This book covers alot of pages and says nothing.Unfortunately I heard only the tail end of the author's interview on NPR radio and the subject sounded interesting on the surface. I wished I'd have heard the whole thing and saved 20 bucks.The book is so loaded with generalities it's like you read a horoscope and say to yourself ""that is dead on"" then notice you looked at the wrong sign. Reading the ""correct sign"" you say oh, that's dead on too..."
3,Satisfied,This book is satisfying to me. I would recommend it for any person majoring in business management.
4,A practical guide to KM (that has been proved to work),"You've read the Knowledge Management theory: now read about the practical reality of it all. This book gives a unique account of how BP has applied the theories of KM in a large, multinational organisation and where it has been successful - the story of how it built on its successes and learned where things did not turn out as predicted.Even if you are not connected with a company the size of BP, this book provides many practical ""knowledge management nuggets"" as well as some tested insights into KM theory that you can pick up and apply in your own environment, knowing that they have already been applied (and they worked) elsewhere."
4,Get Out of Sunnydale Ghoul,"John Passarella, author of ""Ghoul Trouble"" has a sick gift of describing brutal violence and horrific gore. This reader winced several times throughout the novel, especially when one got a mental image of human flesh hanging from three rows of long teeth. After reading ""Ghoul Trouble"", I know the difference between a zombie and a ghoul. Passarella does a terrific job depicting the relationship between Xander and Willow. Yes, Willow loves Oz and Xander is somewhat jealous over Cordelia's new conquest, but Willow and Xander have a friendship that shows a great respect and love for one another. There were a few character flaws concerning Buffy. I don't think Buffy would kiss Angel in a cemetery if a friend was in great peril. Buffy sounds like she is just going through the motions of slaying (void of deep emotions). Overall, the book was fun and satisfying."
4,To much Trouble!!,"For Buffy Summer's she never gets to have any thing easy.Buffy is on the verge of having to deal with to much fighting. When Willow is taken hostage by the town's new meat eater's. Buffy will need all of the help she can get. But un expectedly, Xannder and Oz are mesmerized by a new girl band playing at the Bronze. Then when a new vamp is in town, on a mission to kill Buffy. The vamp ends up almost fighting Angel to the death. With all this going on Buffy has to save her best friend, and kill a vampire who has an open invitation to her house. But how can Buffy kill a vampire that is immune to the sun."
3,"Good, but not very potent",Was gone very quickly. It has a good flavor but other products go a lot farther. Not enough B6 per drop.
5,Keeps nails nice and buffed,Purchased this along with a chamois buffer and it keeps my nails nice and clean looking. Very easy to use and does exactly what I wanted.
5,Good buffing cream!,"I like this cream. Works very well and doesn't flake all over. Makes my cuticules softer also, which is a plus."
3,"The vellum was good, the Seller was poor","These guys don't even get around to shipping your order for a week, and then hide behind their asinine ""policy"" as the reason their delivery to the buyer is so slow. 99% of the companies I've done business with this year ship same day or next day, so I was disappointed because I expected this from them too."
3,Matt Cooper-Entire Series,"I just completed reading the entire Matt Cooper collection. I think that the concept is fascinating, but the delivery is less than stellar. As another reviewer commented, reading it can be confusing due to shifts from 1st person to 3rd person. In addition, some of the material within a story dosesn't track well due to poor editing and character identification. If the series were properly edited and proof read, I would give it a higher rating."
1,Poor craftsmanship,"Got these latches to go next to 100 yr old latches on some cabinets. Not sure how the old latches have lasted 100 years, and these couldnt last 2 weeks. The knobs kept falling off and the latch would break. I finally superglued all knobs in place so they wouldnt come loose, and that seems to be holding. They are still not the best, but I couldnt find any like it anywhere on the web."
3,Efficient -- but didn't meet my expectations,"It's hard to find 17 or 18-month calendars with room to write and this one does provide that. If you like lines on the days,you will probably like this. However, the dimensions are smaller than stated and the calendar is very plain. I will continue to look for a replacement for the Hallmark Peanuts Family Calendar that served me so well for so many years."
2,Uninspired,"Distributed by Museum City Videos, this travel video was actually prepared by what appears to have been the Spanish equivalent of the Barcelona Chamber of Commerce to promote the 1992 Olympics. Incredibly, it manages to make Barcelona look and sound boring.A better bet (at half the length and cost) is the Super Cities tape (ASIN: 6303209777) which portrays Barcelona as the exciting and vibrant city that it really is."
3,A disappointing must have for the Tiny Toons enthusiast,"I have one complaint regarding this product, which will be the focus of the review. While the first two ""volumes"" of the Tiny Toon Adventures collections offered 35 & 30 episodes (repectively), this latest volume contains 17. That leaves an additional 13 episodes to be released, hopefully in a later volume. A big ol raspberry for Warner Home Video who continues to disappoint."
3,Could have been 5* but...,"I have never seen a book collapse so quickly. I was caught up in it -- it has many virtues. It is well written, interesting, covers an obscure incident which should be better known...then I came to the last 100 words which reduced the whole thing to the level of a Hallmark card or below. They could have been omitted and the book would not suffer a bit and I would have awarded it 5 stars. However, they made me go back and review the whole thing, and then I got suspicious of other passages where far too much sentimentality and the author's own emotions (which are not as interesting as he thinks they are) crept in... I confess that I have never had such an odd experience with a book before. I do recommend it, but it is flawed. Read and enjoy it, but bring a skeptical eye to bear on it."
2,Biased Account,"I was often annoyed with the author's inability to write an accurate and even handed account of the Great Denmark Vesey. There are way better books out there. I will continue to search until I find a historian who is fair and isn't afraid to tell it like it was. These myth makers are getting on my last nerves.The only positive thing I can say is that the author directed me to some other historians, most notable John Hope Franklin. I bet he has done a better job."
1,Disappointing,This book leaves out a lot of good information on Denmark Vesey out. There are also errors in this book. It is not even a good coffee table book. I would reccomend reading Douglas R. Egerton's He Shall GO Out Free. That book was fantastic. I would not reccomend this book it was very disappointing. I gave it 1 star for the picture.
3,piaf made easy-listening,"It's wonderful to listen to Edith Piaf's singing in a clear, unscratched, updated CD. It's probably also a little disloyal- wouldn't she have preferred the old copies, with the surface noise? She was never into glamour.But it doesn't matter, because it's good to hear the songs again, and it's an effort to listen to the old disks. It's just a shame that La Vie en Rose is in English only."
5,Fantastic soundtrack,"I watched the film and decided to buy the soundtrack,I bought an Edith Piaf cd previously and it sounded like an lp,the soundtrack cd is crystal clear and sounds fantastic."
3,Piaf Fan,The album was disappointing. I was looking for more of Piaf singing. I did not expect to hear Piaf wannabes or soundtrack background music.
2,Wish I Had Saved My Money,"I love Piaf and I didn't care for this CD. This singer is simply not believable as Piaf. If I had a voice, I could do better myself. Very disappointing. The passion of Piaf just isn't there, sorry."
5,"a wonderful, hard to find product","This is a great product .Free of any dyes (and allergens in my case).It is very hard to find. The company's service is equally as outstanding:and super fast shipping!All in all I say:"" outstanding product , outstanding company.!!!""Thanks!"
3,Tickle His Pickle,"Good information but the book has some really cheezy humor which was not in keeping with the subject matter or intended tone of the book. The author was trying way to hard with the humor and it came off as unauthentic which spoiled it for me. Sex can certainly be humorous at times which I appreciate, but not the way it was presented in this book."
2,"Funny, but disappointing","Bought this book half as a joke. This book took about 30 minutes to fully read because it's mostly drawings and big print. Most of the content was statements not technique. It's got a lot of observations that women have in every day life and a few fun facts, but overall it was disappointing. If it wasn't for the humor I would have given it 1 star. It would be a nice gag gift for someone (insert pun), but don't buy this book if you are actually looking to learn something. The best way to learn is practice. I'm pretty sure there are plenty of men out there willing to help with that practice."
5,Good fun,"Great book, lots of great ideas, even for a couple like us who have been married 9 years. The book is done tastefully, not soft pron like other books in this category. We really enjoyed reading it and trying out several different ideas."
1,Weak at best,Zero value added to my life from the poor writing and illustration of this book. Very childish writing style destroys credibility of the author. I would not recommend it.
3,"Good read, but probably basic","I bought this book in hopes I would get some simple, straightforward advice about how to perform oral sex and touch my boyfriend in pleasing ways. I don't have a whole lot of experience in these areas, and when in doubt, I read. This book certainly gave me the information that I wanted. The instructions were well illustrated, simple to follow, and haven't failed me yet. It's also short and easy to read. At the same time, I give the book 3 stars because, like some of Sadie Allison's other books, the techniques covered in the book are a bit simplistic. If I'd really sat down and thought about it or simply practiced, I probably could have come up with most of the things in this book on my own. If you have a lot of experience, this book probably won't give you much useful information."
4,Tickle Him,"Sadie has written a book that would entertain any women to Tickle His Pickle.She covers many areas in a Fun, Tasteful manner that most any women of any age can enjoy and understand."
1,Not what I had expected...,"I ordered this book thinking it would help me with the tricky task of preserving a hoard of over-ripe vegetables, recently harvested from my garden.I imagined reading about the merits of low-temperature pasteurisation, drooling over pictures of crab apple jelly and studying recipes for spiced red cabbage.To my horror, this book contains none of these delights. It is, in fact, dedicated to the non-reproductive, carnal pleasuring of men.Am I the only person who was fooled into purchasing this lewd handbook by the opaque title and the misleading cover - which clearly shows a pickle-waving housewife beaming with pride at her culinary success?"
1,This book is not for the experienced,I had a lot of hope for this book from the other customer reviews and by all means if you are a beginner or really sexually shy or just typically unadventurous this might be the book for you. I found the suggestions to be very basic and mostly common sense. There wasn't anything in this book I hadn't already done and so I found it a waste of my money.
4,Not for the experienced,"I bought this book when I was about 20 years old. Because I was so young and inexperienced, I learned a lot from reading this. I gave me a new appreciation for it."
3,Worth a read,I learned a couple of things I did not know. Hopefully my husband will be happy when I experiment. Thanks
2,"Good Music, Poor MP3 Rip...","This review is for the MP3 version sold by Amazon: The music, as indicated by other reviewers, is superb, and a must-have for Bluebirds and Buddy Flett fans. But I opted for the MP3 download rather than pay the freight and wait for the CD. This is, by far, the worst MP3 download I have ever made. The MP3 volume is at least 7 to 8 dB below the normal range, meaning this album is very quiet and you really need to crank the volume on your player, which in turn can introduce additional background noise. I do not know if this is a result of the ripping process, but since no other reviewer has mentioned this, I assume it is. So...pay the freight, get the CD, and enjoy!"
5,"Best book for new parents, EVER!","I actually read this book first as ""The Story About the Baby"" on Jeff Vogel's blog years ago now, but the book has added features that make it well worth the purchase. The author's (relatively) honest take on parenting is not only refreshing, it's hilarious! It was a wonderful balm for the ever pervasive fear tact taken by all other parenting books out there. I can't say enough great thing about it. Buy this book so that you too can understand that your child is and will be ""dopey""."
1,What about his daughter's privacy?,"The reviews of this book praise Vogel for being funny and a good writer. He is indeed both. But may I point out that his book sale comes at the expense of his daughter's privacy. She's a little girl now, and doesn't care, but in not so many years, she'll be a teenager, and I wonder how she'll feel then about having her infantile bodily fluids and secretions described in painstaking detail in this book?I've written in more detail about the issue of children and privacy here[...]It's an important issue, and one of which most people in our society today seem completely unaware."
2,"kind of ugly, if you read between the lines","i read this book because of its good reviews and because, having grown up around them, i love siamese cats. this book, however -- i'm unsure if it's because it's british, or because it's a product of the 1950s, or both -- really turned me off with its depiction of pet ownership.when you strip away the author's admittedly charming anthropomorphisms of the animals around her, the story reads as such: a couple buys a purebred siamese cat to live an outdoor/indoor life and catch mice in a neighborhood where cats and other pets are not kept indoors, seldom spayed or neutered, and often fight. the resulting pregnancies (spare one planned one) and injuries weren't terribly pleasant to read about, with or without that charming veneer."
2,For Siamese Cat Lovers,"I bought this book because I love cats and am always in search of good cat books. This one was disappointing though, despite the good reviews. The inconsistent and poor grammar was distracting. And even though I love cats, this book managed to turn me off Siamese ones. Through the book, I now understand that they are very loud troublemakers. For those who love Siamese cats however, this book may be entertaining."
5,YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK IF YOU LOVE SIAMESE CATS!,"This has to be one of the most enjoyable books I have ever read. I laughed until I had tears running down my face, and also cried for a particularly sad part. I honestly don't think I have ever been so moved by a book. I read this book twice in the first week that I had it. If you have the oppurtunity to read or buy this book, please do so!"
5,"An often humorous, often sad book keeping you to the end.","Cats In The Belfry by Doreen is the first book in a series about her Blue Point cats. Right from the very first page, you can tell that this book is going to have a lot of funny parts. As you finish the first few chapters it is virtually impossible to put down because the story just continues smootly. When you do eventually reach the end, you will want to read it again because just once is not enough to enjoy the book 100%."
3,A Brief Review,"Steve Yarborough portrays a small Mississippi Delta town in 1902 in his book, Visible Spirits. His is obviously intimately acquainted with the lifestyle and morals of his home state during that period, when racism and Jim Crow laws seemed to dominate society.The strength of this book lies in its authenticity and its attention to detail. It is well-written and has good character development, but it is flawed. Its weakness lies in not having sufficient story to justify this 273-page account.I enjoyed the book but would hope for more eventful stories in future books by this author."
3,Mona Lisa,"This book is set in the Mississippi Delta after the Civil War. It tells the story of race relations between blacks and whites. The Author is good at story telling, but there are no insights into improvment into race relations in the south and other parts of the country."
4,"Okay, but not really compelling","The plot description of this book sounded very promising, but I found it kind of hard to get into. ""Ho-hum"" comes to mind. It really is a good story; however, I can't give it 5 stars because it simply didn't hold my interest throughout large parts of the book."
4,"""Racial"" Tension Illustrated","This story depicts the ""racial"" tension in the deep south following the War Between the States. The writing style and sentence construction flowed smoothly and did not interfere with the flow of the story or draw attention to themselves. The characters were believable. On the other hand, in a manner of speaking it's hard to say who the ""hero"" of the story was supposed to have been. The protagonist seemed more like an ANtagonist; he was a selfish bigot. Was I supposed to appreciate him? Sympathize with him? Identify with him? There wasn't really a very clear plot development and resolution, either. I was also disappointed that there were a couple of instances of extreme foul language, which I didn't find to even be particularly true to the setting. Still, all considered, I enjoyed this story and found it to be a quick read."
2,Visible Spirits - Invisible Ending,"Visible Spirits, while not overly engrossing or riveting, does provide enough drama to make it readable. I would have enjoyed the book more if the relationships between the characters had been fully developed or at least explained early on in the story, and if there had been more character development for others in the story other than Tandy. Then there's the problem of the big showdown between the town whites and the black man accused of murder. There's no mention of what happened. The towns people show up at the mans house, the mayor is subsequently injured, but what happened to the man accused of murder is anyone's guess.The story ends years later without much mention of what transpired between that time and the big showdown. You learn a little of what happens in the lives of a couple of the characters and then it's over.This was an okay book, but not my idea of a great story."
3,Part technothriller and part evolutionary detective story,"""The Meek"" by Scott Mackay is an incredible science fiction novel that uses shopworn genre concepts to create a fresh narrative of sometimes unbearable suspense. ""The Meek"" is SF in the old-fashioned tradition: When a survey ship is sent to inspect an asteroid habitat thirty years after a bloody civil uprising and attempted extermination, the crew finds that the habitat is populated by genetically modified humans with superior strength and intelligence. Stranded and unsure whether the unsuspected inhabitants can be trusted, the central characters are pitted against time as the government demands the asteroid's unconditional surrender. Part technothriller and part evolutionary detective story, ""The Meek"" builds to a rousing climax that shows Mackay is every bit as good at writing about humans as he is at depicting alien landscapes and the consequences of biotechnology."
2,"Not much science in the fiction, but readable","The story was enought to keep me reading, I'll grant that. But the details were like some teenager's first attempt. Asteroids are equipped with singularities to create gravity, but travel from Ceres to Earth is too expensive. If you can create singularities of planetary mass, little trips in the solar system are not going to bother you.Spacesuit oxygen supplies are calibrated to the second, people are in no distress until the timer goes ""click"" then they're suffocating.The orbital mechanics are positively Velikovskian in their convenience at times.Some parts seem informed by video games, rather than SF.Some of the writing is turgid, with sentences cluttered with more numbers than words.I think I got this free at Torcon - I hope I didn't pay cash for it!"
2,Interesting concepts wrapped in boring and bland,"How is this book getting 5 star reviews? The characters are boring and unimaginative, and all apparently suffer from a total lack of believable emotional response. Supposedly abandoned base filled with hostile blue mutants? Meh. Life support crisis and serious threat of a slow, painful death? Yawn. Imminent inter-solar war with super mutants? Whatever. I've seen people get more worked up over lint.If this was ever made into a film it would be a $300 million dollar Michael Bay blockbuster with a cast made up of summer stock rejects. In fact even then I doubt you'd get performances wooden and drab enough.In short this is a few hours of my life I WANT BACK!"
1,Garbage,This is a terrible Cd. I can't believe I wasted money on it. All hype and no substance. A perfect CD if your contemplating suicide and you need something to push you over the edge. Don't waste your time.
1,lazy music for lazy people,"Low is one of the great con jobs of the century (young as it is). Their low-fi ""gimmick"" seems to be enough for their fans, who obviously celebrate amateurish playing and junior-high poetry class lyrics. Making it louder only amplifies their weaknesses. Only in Minnesota..."
5,The editorial review was wrong...,"This album is great! It DOES work when you speed up Low, especially when you add an occasional shoegaze aesthetic and thrashing guitar (as on The Great Destroyer). I was considerably bored with Low around the time Trust came out--not that it was bad, but it seemed like a hodge-podge of different sounds that didn't quite work, and I was tired of the slowcore formula. I was glad to have Canada, which was fresh-sounding and showed that they were trying new things. So, I'd say that was the transitional album, not this one.This one works. Rush out and buy it. Maybe you'll be as pleased as I was!"
4,Better than the other live album,"This is an over all better live collection than the one released on Ryko. The band is Much tighter for the studio rehersals and they leave in the stage banter so you can get a little more of a taste of Chilton's Personatlity. The only thing that tops this is Chiltons Version of ""Motel Blues"" on the other one, so you better buy both."
4,Big Star Redux,"A Big Star release is always welcomed and rare. This CD is a mix of 1974 rehersals in NY and a live 1974 gig in Memphis. While a live release with Chris Bell lineup would be the most desired new release; here we find Alex's workman-like run through of all the Big Star classics. This disc even finds Alex plodding through an unremarkable version of ""The Letter."" Good quality sound and worth the investment. Perhaps ""That 70's Show"" will shine the light on the Ardent genius once again for those who missed it the first time around."
4,Live Big Star to Warm Your Soul,"This is a must for Big Star fans. The first half are demos and remastered takes in the studio and are o.k., but the second half is from a live Big Star show in 1974 and it is vintage Big Star and Chilton. I love it all--from the announcer requesting that the audience not dance (this was in Memphis in 1974!) to Chilton's singing on The Letter and Mod Lang. Great stuff and more evidence that this is the prototypic American rock band."
1,Stinking Toy!,I got this figure in the mail one day and I was excited to take it out. I took it out and played with it a little and the next thing I know is his freaking hand falls off! I pick it up and then it falls again and then it got wedged in the corner of a car so now i will never have his stupid hand again. It would be great if it was more durable. At first I thought it was from the movie at the end but then I realized it was his left arm that gets cut off not his right!
3,This book was GREAT!!!,"I think this book was full of adventure, excitment, and it was eccentric!I loved this book so much it only took me 6 days to read it. Even though it i unussually long I found myself reading it at 12pm! I loved this book, but i don't recomend it! Watch the movie at a theater near you!!"
2,Not the best for LC9,"I got this for the Ruger LC9. It held the gun, but with minimal retention. It is OK as a basic holster to wear to the range, but I would not trust it with any secure retention."
1,this holster dosent fit the sccy cpx,This holster is not for the sccy cpx 9mm it will only go in part way it dose not lock in .I emailed fobus and was told thatit would not work so this is false advertising if you ask me it will work with the kel tec and lc9 but not sccy cpx
2,Piece of junk,"It was a plastic toy, completely worthless, it didn't work and it didn't fit in the lighter compartment. It appeared to be something sold at the 99 Cents store and as a toy. I guess the price should've been a big clue as to what I was getting. The old saying is true, ""you get what you pay for"" and I paid nothing for it so I got nothing."
2,Buyer beware,The product shipped is not the product in the photograph. The item in the photograph appears in an animal print fabric. The item shipped to me is a black terry cloth which has shed lint on everything it touches. My cat loves it but what does she know?
2,not as good as everyone is saying,"I bought this on the hype I read on here, and expected to find an enjoyable rock album. Although this album has some great guitar playing, the vocals is what really makes me diss this. It's like the singers voice doesn't mix with the songs, he sounds like the male version of Daphne & Celeste. His voice is too deep for this album...the tabloids should slow down their sound if they want their singer to sound any good (and not like some drunken fool), or they should fire him and hire a new one. Never again will I buy a cd that is so hyped like this one. If you want some good rock, buy Juliana Hatfield's 2 new releases, ""beautiful creature"" and ""total system failure"". the box set will give u a bang for your buck."
1,HOT HOT HOT,"I honestly can't tell you how the flavor is because it is SO HOT you can't taste the flavor. My mouth burned for hours after eating this. I like spicy food but this is not spicy, it's just EXTREMELY HOT. If you like to TASTE what you are eating buy something else. I will NEVER buy any of Tony Chacheres products again."
3,MY cousin loves it,"My cousin has this toy and loves it. The only thing is that the track do not stay together. When the bridge falls and he goesto fix it the track comes part which is fustrating for a 5 y.o. For the most part he loves it but personally i dont htink it was worth the $100+. Hes unable to sit in the middle of the tracks and watch the train go around ( like manay kids love) and the train goes very slow and he always trying to speed it up and im afraid he may break it. I think this year I may invest and buy him a LIONEL train, b/c at least then he cant sit and watch the train speed around an an occasional smoke isnt bad."
2,not our favorite train set,"For the price, this is an ok set. It would be better for a 5-6 year old, not 3 as the box indicates. If your child is young, it is really difficult and frustrating. It is hard for little hands to put the cars together. This set is also big so that it doesn't fit in our train table. The track pieces are so long that alternate track layouts on the train table are very limited. With the batteries our son just watched the train go around and around. We bought a wooden set from Learning Curve which is much better. He can do the cars and put the track together by himself. Since it is not batterey operated, he is actually playing with it - instead of just watching it go around."
4,Great set but engine battery replacement is a pain,This train set is easy to set up and everything has worked just fine on carpet. My only problem is replacing the batteries in the engines is a royal pain! The battery case does not screw off. You have to press the engine sides together while you pry off the bottom piece. I spent 30 minutes replacing the batteries in one engine. This is a great value and my kids love it but I hope the manufacturer figures out a better way to design the engines. I came close to throwing poor Thomas against a wall.
5,Birthday Gift,My god son loves Thomas The Train and this was a gift for his third birthday and from all the reports i've been getting he loves it and his mother's thinking about getting stock in a battery company. He plays with the trains from the time he gets up till its time for bed.[...]
2,The little things kill you,"The motherboard died in the first week. HP Support did service after hours of hotline diagnosis and sending it to their shop. Most recently the Off-On switch is VERY tempermental. Most of the time the On button toggles on the fans but nothing else. The Geek Squad tried and failed, we replaced the power supply, which helped for a few days, but now can get the machine to cycle on only once every few days (multiple tries per day)."
3,Slim Abs,I found that this product works somewhat according to the details of what results I should receive. I was expecting better results of slimming my abs without cosmetic surgery to include with my daily routine of crunches.
2,Heard the author on NPR,"Loved what he said on the radio, but his book is full of inaccurate statistics that are so outdated and irrelevant now. I bought ""Very Good"" condition, but the binding was broken, so the cover was not attached."
4,Greatest Hits - NWA,"I started to hear NWA after buyin this album. Before that all I knew was that NWA took gagnsta rap to whole another level which is true!I loved every song on this CD!Standout tracks are:""F**k the police""""Gangsta Gangsta""""Straight Outta Compton""""100 Miles and Runnin""If u a new NWA fan or want to hear NWA before starting to buy their CD collection like me, buy this CD first!"
4,GOOD COLLECTION OF N.W.A CLASSICS,"IF YOU'D LIKE TO JUST GET ALL OF THE N.W.A SONGS YOU LOVE WITHOUT HAVING TO COLLECT ALL OF THE OLD N.W.A ALBUMS, THIS CD IS FOR YOU. THIS COLLECTION IS ALMOST PERFECT, BUT, LIKE ALMOST EVERY OTHER GREATEST HITS CD, IT'S MISSING A FEW TRACKS. MISSING IN THIS COLLECTION ARE ''8 BALL'', ''DOPEMAN'' AND ''SA PRIZE''. OTHER THAN THAT, THIS IS A GREAT COLLECTION FROM THE WORLD'S MOST DANGEROUS GROUP. IF WE'RE LUCKY, WE MIGHT HEAR A NEW ALBUM FROM N.W.A ONE DAY. THIS VERSION OF THE GREATEST HITS CD HAS THE 2 N.W.A REUNION TRACKS, WHICH ARE ''HELLO'' AND ''CHIN CHECK''."
2,Pointless,"Why bother? They only had one creatively vibrant & commercial succesful album - ""Straight Outta Compton"" - which also has all of their notable songs. You're much better off with that than this, which just takes the highlights of ""Compton"" and mixes them with sub-par material from their other albums."
5,N.W.A the best album out,"I love N.W.A they are a really good hiphop grop if you like DMX, Eminem, DR DRE, 2 PAC or WU-tang you should get this CD it is a mixture of all of N.W.As best songs. I really like ""straight outta comton"" and ""Gangster Gangster""."
1,Not Without Armageddon,"mister milk man that write review down doesn't ""get"" the meaning of the name. it is religious reference and won't make sense to those that are not saved by the lord jesus. the name of the band means that they do not want to live in the anti-religion world that does not accept the coming of the lord our jesus christ. NOT WITHOUT ARMAGEDDON. do you get it now milk man? listen to these godly brothers and let jesus into your heart. it is because of their deep religion that i give this dangerous album my best review. praise the lord and listen to not without armageddon!!!!"
4,My Review,"NWA are the greatest rap group ever.This Cd is a must have.With songs like ""Gangsta Gangsta"" And ""I ain't the one"" It will keep you entertained for hours."
5,Westcoast finest in one album!,"Eazy, Cube, Dre, Ren, and Yella where the beatles of the hoods of Los Angeles, Watts, Inglewood, and Compton in the 80's. With hits like ""gangsta gangsta"" ""F*** the police"" ""straight out of Compton"" ""express yourself"" ""100 miles and running"" and my favorite Mc Rens ""If it aint ruff"" are just a few in this album that made them Westcoasts' finest rap group ever and few will argue with me. If you are an NWA fan you already have this album but if you don't go and buy it now! you will not regret it."
5,Greatest Book Ever,After reading this book two simple words came to mind-- literary genius. The plot takes a dramatic twist when the naked boy pulls his heater on the unsuspecting balloon. Perfect for children of all ages.
4,Lots of excellent industrial history,While the title of the book precludes a history of the Hoover dam. I found it to contain much more. The book does give a very good acounting of the building of the Hoover Dam.It also covers the beginnigs of some of the largest corporations in the world.
3,Good cutter horrible crusher,"It works great at cutting round pills will not work for any that are not round. Does not crush fine at all, needed to make smaller for my special needs daughters medicine and it does not break it down well at all."
3,Catwoman Action figure,"This figure and others in the series are made for ages 4+, and that's an appropriate age for the most part...however, the accessories they come with are tiny, and I mean microscopic, and it's frustrating for a four year old to try to make the figure hold the accessories or try to balance the figures to stand up. Consequently I am forever attaching accessories, looking for accessories, and arranging feet so the thing will stand. Although slightly more durable than the Marvel Universe figures it is not indestructable. Other than that, my son gets a lot of enjoyment from these figures and they are easy to travel with and good size for little hands to hold."
2,It does not have subtitles,"The DVD is in spanish (100 Minutos- Audio En Espanol) It says so right on the cover, but the product details also say the DVD has english subtitles.NOT THE CASE!Major bummer since I haven't had to speak any spanish since 7th grade and I wasn't even that good at it then."
4,Nice mugs,"Originally bought a set of these at Pottery Barn several years ago. Ordered six more to replace two that a clumsy house guest broke and to have a backup supply. The replacements are just like the ones I bought originally so I was happy with that. However, one of the mugs arrived broken and the seller has not been willing to replace it, so buy at your own risk."
4,Comedy Classics,"Though it's not a classic as in My Man Godfrey or His Girl Friday, these films from the 60's are as much a part of the list as any others. Jane Fonda and Dean Jones at the height of their popularity. Should not be missed."
3,sweet but tiny,this is a sweet little book but too tiny to really write much in at all. It measures about 3 1/2 inches by 4 inches. Good for a pocketbook only. pictures are cute & one for each month. I wouldn't buy it again as I thought it would be a bit larger & more practical.
2,Anne Geddes 2002 Date Book,The past 4 years I have used Anne Geddes Date Books. They have always been 7 inches x 9 inches. This year the book was much too small with much less pictures and I was very disappoited.
1,Piece of junk,"I bought this for my KelTec P3-AT. However, the KelTec would notfit into the holster. The holster itself is a piece of hard plasticthat is supposed to be molded just right for this KelTec...but it isn't.The pistol would not seat in the holster and more than half of it was hangingout of the holster. Buy a leather holster and forget about these cheap plastic ones."
5,Yes good,"Ultra has put out cool record for years. It is sometimes hard to talk about them. Being a big fan of Electro, this one stands out of the pack for me. Sure you have some great bands like Depeche Mode, Gorillaz, Ladytron, Goldfrapp, and Moby. But you also have some new acts like Shiny Toy Guns and Daisy Daisy. You also have some of the best remixers like DFA and Tommie Sunshine. Of course Mylo and Jacques Lu Cont is on here as well. This is a jamming party mix. It's two CDs and is full of surprises."
4,"Not bad, but not total electro","Some darn good tracks here, but also some house-y stuff which isn't what I think of when I hear ""electro""."
1,"thanks ultra, but not thanks.","ultra recordings in their infinite power and 'wisdom' realized that the 'electronica' umbrella is broken and in total disrepair, and is now bending 'electro' to fit the bill, and why not, it's easier to spell and pronounce.mind you, it's hard to resist the power and influence and of course money that a label like ultra can offer an artist, and that's probably why this compilation even exists, but david waxman will probably live to regret being involved with such a horrible misrepresentation of 'electro' -- a timeless phenomenon, ethos, musical composition philosophy, and far more artistic genre to those who bother to find true examples of it... this. is not amongst those examples."
4,WOW!,This book is fantastic. It is very comprehensive and easy to understand. I will keep this in my library forever.
1,Very questionable authority,"The title of the book is a great idea, and it obviously resonates with lots of people including me as I purchased the book. I should have paid more attention to the one review pointing out the error regarding fish oil studies.When I got my copy, I skimmed it. First, the initial several pages of quotes filled with praise were all from middle rank or obscure sources. No accolades from the AMA here, or any known brain researchers. Last, the final study quoted was on whether prayer helps patients. The author quoted a study showing it does. That is not my reading of the literature. How can I trust the rest of the information in the book given that mediocrity ?I threw the book away in great frustration and annoyance and will have to start searching again. This time I will look for a book from a respected scientist and take more time before I bite."
2,Interesting ideas but lousy execution,"Perhaps I'm spoiled by Dave Baum's great books but I found this book very frustrating. Some of the bots are interesting but I was unable to build most of them because they require extra parts that don't come in the Lego Mindstorms RIS. That'd be OK if the book told you what extra part syou need but I'd get 70% done and find myself short 6 #3 elbows (or whatever). True, he lists the needed parts before each bot, but he doesn't tell you which ones aren't part of the RIS. Baum does. Also, the pictures in the book lack contrast so it is hard to see details and the ""steps"" aren't specific. Buy the Baum books instead."
2,beginners will enjoy it,"this is a very basic book, if you are just starting with MindStorms or if you are 12 years old, then you'll like it. Hackers, dont think about getting it."
2,Cd is defective in that it has skips in the music.,"I definitely love the Music, but the CD has skips in the music. I will not purchase one that is not new again."
4,Chinese Butterfly Designs,"Awesome designs!! So many to choose from!! I used some for favors, thank you notes, and address labels!!"
5,Beautiful,Bought these for my wedding and I have to say I LOVED them. I was so happy I went with them. They are made really nice...the silver bottom and stem are solid metal and they feel sturdy when you hold them. Everyone complimented us on them!
4,elegant,We ordered these for our wedding and I can't wait to sip some bubbly with my husband. Simply elegant and they will have a special place in our wedding day!
1,"Would be 5 stars, but verses were changed!","We loved this book when we checked it out from the library. Unfortunately, in the copy we ordered, two of the best verses were changed. Fortunately there were some other reviews talking about this problem, so I knew to check. What a disappointment--the ""witch with french fries sounds delicious to me!"" and ""I think just this once I'll have witch without fries"" lines are some of my son's favorites. In the changed version they are replaced with bland alternatives, and one verse doesn't even scan anymore. Many thanks to the reviewers who alerted me, or I would have had a very confused and sad little birthday boy."
5,2 1/2 year old loves this book!,"This is my grandaughter's, new favorite book. I found it on a list of good rhyming books for kids. It's nicely illustrated and the storyline is cute. Good halloween read."
5,LOVE reading this to my children,This is a great kid's book. The story is cute and the repetitive rhymes keep my kid's interested and participating.
5,Wonderful story!,"My 2 year-old boys received this book as a gift from their Grandma. I wanted to strangle her because it is the only book the boys would let us read for at least a month! Every day, 4 or 5 times per day we had to read Room on the Broom. The Witch isn't scary but, in fact, is quite nice. It is a story of being helpful and kind to others. Because of the great rhyming and cute pictures it is appropriate for children as young as 2 but the theme and silly nature of the book make it appropriate for older children as well."
5,Great fun for kids and adults,"This book was a gift for my 2 year old son. He sits rapt while I read the story and enjoys identifying the animals and noticing what has fallen off the witch's broom. I absolutely love the happy story, and it is pure pleasure to read out loud. The rhymes are great and the part about the dragon makes me giggle every time. I'm going to buy all Julia Donaldson's other books!"
5,Loved it!,"My nephew LOVES to read. He is well read for 6. I send him all types of books and saw this one when I was searching for Halloween stories.He absolutely loved it! He had to call me and read me some of it over the phone. I will be looking for more books from this author.Michelle Elizabeth Rogers, children's author[...]"
5,Friendship Book,Kindergarteners are all about making friends and sharing. This is a great book for developing those concepts. My 5-yr old loves this book.
4,Cute story for preschoolers...,Cute story for preschoolers. The book material felt a bit cheap to me. Wouldn't buy it for a gift. Cute story though.
5,Room on the Broom,"Our children loved this book, as did we!!! One of our all time favorites ~ and one that will be enjoyed, and cherished between Oct. 31st through Oct. 30th!!! There is nothing not to like... nothing."
4,Recent Order of Paperback has 'Witch with Fries' Text,"Wanted everyone to know that I ordered the paperback version in Sept. 2011 and received a copy with the famous 'witch with fries' text. I don't love this book yet like some, but my daughter is super excited to be a witch for Halloween so I set out to purchase a witch book. I haven't shared it with her yet. Maybe her excitment will make the book."
5,Best loved book by my 3 y/o & 18 mo/o daughters,"I ordered this a few weeks before Halloween because of the positive reviews and my need for a Halloween book to read to my 3 y/o's preschool class. Now that we've owned this book for 6 weeks I cannot even begin to count how many times we've read it. My 3 y/o begs me to read the witch book and the only one that loves it more than her is my 18 m/o. She will find the book and immediately begins smiling and running toward me with it. They both sit captivated through the whole book and usually make me read it at least twice in a single sitting. The book is written in rhyme and has a wonderful rhythm. The description recommends it for children 4-8, and while I think they'd enjoy it as well, I definitely recommend it enthusiastically for the younger set.P.S. I purchased this in October 2011 and the book had the correct ""witch with french fries"" line"
5,One of our Favorites for Halloween,"this is one of my son's favorite halloween stories. the illustrations are colorful and fun, and the story is nice. In this story, as witch flies by on her broom, she drops something (her wand, the bow from her hair, etc). She lands on the ground to search for the lost item, and meets a new friend who finds the item for her and asks for a ride on the broom. The broom gets pretty crowded, with a cat, a dog, a bird, a frog, and snaps in half. When the broom crashes to the ground, the witch finds herself in trouble and her new friends come to her rescue.There is one semi-scary dragon in the story, but it didn't seem to bother my 4yo. We love this story and I would absolutely recommend for preschool aged kids."
5,favorite book,"This is my child and my favorite book.Is the cutest history we have read, after 'where is pup' that is for younger kids.I am here in amazon just to find some more titles from the authors."
3,children archeologists,"i wasn't in love with this book, but it is part of an unfolding story including two other Curry books.some kids stumble upon ancient artifacts, they get whisked away to the past, their lives are in danger, but they help an ancient tribe in the past, but they help them also in the future by uncovering them because no one had known of them..."
4,Pleased!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I am very pleased with my missal. The look and feel of it is great. easy to carry with me to mass. I especially like that it has latin on one side of the page and english on the other side made it easy to follow along. It also has cycle A,B,C readings which makes it a great 7 days a week missal."
2,This is NOT a Latin/English Daily Roman Missal,"When I read that the Daily Roman Missal was in Latin and English, I assumed that all the Readings were also in Latin and English. After receiving the Missal, it was very disappointing when I saw that the Readings are in English ONLY. Ended up being a $60.00 mistake on my part for thinking it was a true Latin/English Roman Catholic Missal. Live and learn. So I've decided to drive to a bookstore and examine my next Roman Catholic Missal, instead of relying on an ""on-line"" description to make a decision."
2,Burgandy-Large Print,The Roman Missal I received was exactly what I had previewed in a nearby church except for the size. THe extra large print really increased the size of the book for me. I decided to send it back on 4/12/08 because it was too heavy for me. I would love to have the regular size print book if possible. If not I hope to get a refund. Size was myu only factor of disappointment. The missal was great otherwise.
3,Not real leather,"This missal has a bonded leather cover, not genuine leather. Do not be misled. I cannot comment on the rest of the missal, as I'm returning mine."
5,Daily Roman Missal,"It came in in time to give to my husband for Christmas, he was very pleased. It was expensive, but cost less than at the Catholic book store in town."
5,Satisfied Customer,"I love my new daily missal, it contains both daily and Sunday readings, devotional prayers, Feast days of the Saints, Order of Mass, and so much more in this small easy to carry book. The price on amazon.com is the cheapest you will find this Missal with free shipping which was a big plus for me. I highly recommend this updated version."
5,Daily Roman Missal - LARGE PRINT Black leather Bound,"This is the perfect companion for daily or Sunday Mass. Easy to read, easy to hold. The book is a little heavy but not too bad."
5,All in one,"was looking for an affordable weekday missal. Found not only a good weekday missal, but also a sunday missal and prayer book all in one at a reasonable price.Very well satisfied."
3,NOT LEATHER BOUND AS STATED - IT IS BONDED LEATHER,"This review is for the new revision, Seventh Edition, printed in 2011. The new Mass prayers are included but this edition IS NOT Leather bound. The ISBN for the leather bound version (black) is 978-1-936045-60-0. The ISBN for this one is 978-1936045-59-4 and is Identified as BONDED LEATHER on the rear cover. I had even sent a question to Amazon before ordering it and they assured me it was leather, not bonded leather. I have it in hand, received from Amazon today, and can assure everyone that it is NOT leather, but is BONDED LEATHER. The Missal itself is very nice and contains all of the new Mass prayers. Just disappointed in Amazon selling it as being Leather Bound so as to compete unethically with other sellers. Would actually rate product itself higher if Amazon had represented it truthfully."
2,Racist Propaganda - Not Ifa,"As a Babalawo, I have never seen so much racism in a book. Perhaps the author would like to offer a refund to any person not ""of color"" since he declares that the ancester ceremonies will not benefit them. The ancester ceremonies of Ifa, which he describes in the most rudimentary of ways, will work for all people. Shame on Ra Ifagbemi for spreading hatred and confusion."
2,Black Only,"My name is Alwo OgbeSA. This is a angry young man who needs to know IFA and my God Olodumare loves more then black people, but loves all. Some of his skills would be in question also. I glad it was a cheap book because the author cheapened IFA to a color. Thanks to the Great Olodumare who loves all color, people will make in spite of continual racism like this. If you are not a black racist please don't waste your time buying and supporting this person."
2,Written Unlike A Scholar,"The author is said to be well-educated, a scholar and conversant in more than four languages. His book is written in a sermon / lecture format. However, his discussions and references should be delivered to a junior high school audience. All contents and facts presented in his book would appeal to spiritualists, psychics and new-agers alike. The book would also serve a better purpose for individuals suffering low self-esteem and despair -if you are Afrocentric. I can appreciate a mild introduction to the Ancestoral lineage and spirituality however it serves a disppointment when an author of such educational caliber does not elaborate factually. For instance, Native American concepts, rites and rituals, Cubans' historical reverence for their ancestors and Yoruban ancestoral festivities.A reader will find more information on this topic by ascertaining earth based religions as a whole. Unfortunately that may be time consuming."
3,Worth the buy,"If you're a beginning beginner as related to spirits and the spiritual realm, this book serves as a pretty good introduction. Otherwise, you'll end up skimming past most of the topics.In actuality, I purchased the book to learn more about preparing an Ancestral Altar. This particular section of the book provides detailed step-by-step instructions that will guide you to properly prepare and use your alter.Finally, also of particular interest was the listing of ""Books of Interest."" A section similar to this is always helpful for those on a ""Knowledge-trek."""
4,A Sleeper..,"The Equinox was a hot album playas. I like the cover because it looks like a movie or something. The beats are slammin and it shows on tracks like ""Somehow,Someway"" and ""Soundman"". The lyrics by Monch and Prince are as tight as ever..The problem with the album is all of the skits but that's about it..."
2,Not worth it,"Doesn't hold my gun securely. I have a Gov't Issue 1911 and it will slid around a little. THe whole thing feels a bit cheap but it does do the job of keeping it locked up and inaccessible. Still, I don't like it enough to actually use it."
4,"Not quite the ultimate, but very good","I read, write and speak Spanish reasonably well, but like many individuals whose first language is English, I have my moments trying to follow Spanish spoken to me. This set has really been helpful in ""tuning"" my ear to listen to the spoken word as I prepare for another trip to Mexico. It is also a pretty decent review of Spanish grammar and vocabulary. Because I am perhaps more visual, I find the written materials to be a great help for my learning -- I really have not been successful with just oral materials. I actually purchased this after using a Living Language beginning French set and found it very helpful in beginning to recapture the French I studied 30 years ago in high school and then 20 years ago in a night course."
2,CDs Useless.,"I didn't have the patience to listen to all of the CDs, but what I heard was terrible. They repeat every sentance in English, then in Spanish. This is not advanced at all and a jarring way to learning the language. Like other reviewers, I thought this was at most intermediate and not advanced. I'm still looking for a good CD set..."
2,Useful only if you have no problem with understanding spoken Spanish,"I am a little over half-way through this course. It covers advanced Spanish grammar quite well, and its strength lies in the large body of recorded material. However, I do have reservations in recommending the course for the simple reason that the oral exercises (""Learn on the Go"") are not transcribed; this omission is a serious drawback, since many learners will find difficulty in understanding all the words spoken in these exercises (some of which is new vocabulary) - not helped by a couple of the speakers occasionally slurring words. Transcribing the exercises would have greatly increased the ease of revision."
2,ultimate spanish advanced,This product is fair. It in my opinion is not up to the usual living language products of the past.
4,An interesting edition to the Btech Library,This is one book that pretty much sets you up for things to come. It also gives you an idea on the political climate. It is a good addition to your Btech Library.
2,Pointlessly not funny,"It's pretty sad when toward the end of the movie I realized there was probably more in the previews that kept my interest than in the movie itself.This seems to want to be one of those American Pie, The New Guy, etc movies but it never gets close to that level. There's just little to no funny in it. As far as sex appeal goes there are two girls that get topless semi-frequently thru the movie. They are decent but their accents are so annoying that I was basically glad they weren't in it much. Pam Anderson's part was a total joke. The way the end challenge resolves was super laim.Susan Ward was the only redeeming part for me as a fan of hers but I'd rather just watch The In Crowd if I want to watch her in a sexy role. Shallow Hal is a much funnier movie if I want to watch her in a more sweet & innocent type of role.I'm glad I only searched this movie out so I could get combo shipping on other items I ordered because it isn't worth much at all."
1,A waste of time and money,My fault. I suspected going in. But usually these kinds of movies have some entertainment value.It has been a long time since I have seen acting this bad. And the totally expected cliche story line. No surprises here.Inane.Not even up to my low standards.
4,One of his best efforts.,"Christopher Franke is a very effective soundtrack composer, probably best known for his music for the TV series Babylon 5 and Walker, Texas Ranger. Before moving to the United States, he had been an influential member of the electronic music group Tangerine Dream for 18 years. They were for a while on the avante garde of new electronic music. But ... you've got to admit that Christopher Franke in particular has swerved in completely the opposite direction. The Celestine Prophecy is based on James Redfield's book of the same name. It contains soothing atmospherics and samples of exotic instruments, and is very accessible. It sounds like the best of any new age music on recording today. This is probably his finest independant record (that is, not with Tangerine Dream or for a film). You can say it's a soundtrack, in a loose sort of sense, but it's really one of those ""inspired by ..."" deals. However, it's probably the most deep, thoughtful and complex music he's ever written."
2,Not for me....,"Based on the other reviews, I figured I would enjoy this cd. I was wrong. I found this to be very, very annoying to listen to. I tried, I really did. Suffered listening to it twice, thinking it might grow on me. It did, like cancer. It is a combo of asian/african/island music all wrapped into one, with annoying background vocals on several tracks. I could never see anybody meditating or even relaxing to this. Then again, everybody is different. To each their own. This was not for me, and I could never recommend it. I'll stick to my sounds of nature cds."
1,Really hokey movie,"I had seen parts of this movie many years ago and I wanted to not only own it on DVD, (because I have ""Dream A Little Dream"" 1, but I wanted to watch this movie all the way though, plus complete the 2 movie set of ""Dream A Little Dream."") I have to say that the movie is VERY disappointing and is even hokey, (more hokier than the first movie with the same name with the 2 Coreys in it was a few years prior to this movie being released.) I am also not really happy with Corey Feldman as an actor in this movie any way, because he isn't that good of an actor even outside of this movie and Corey Feldman was a jerk in the A & E show called the ""2 Coreys."""
3,Dream a Little Dream 2,I liked the first Dream a Little Dream much better. I had a hard time figuring out what was going on with Dream a Little Dream 2.
4,Dream a little dream 2,This sequel was a lot different then the original. Not as good as the first but still recommend.
3,look @ newer version,"The law does not stand still. Look at the author's newer, and more expensive book Cross- Examination: The Comprehensive Guide For Experts. It covers a lot of the same material and is updated on changes."
2,"Good substance, distracting voice","This information is good, calming and helpful. The music is wonderful and soothing. I was so excited when I got this cd until about one minute into it.I could not get through the whole cd though because her? voice is extrememly distracting. It sounds like she has a speech impediment possibly. It would've been much better to have someone else record the materials. Someone with a a soothing voice.I tried to move ahead to see if other tracks would be better, but you can not forward through the tracks. It is produced as one long track rather than several smaller ones."
3,Knowledgeable but Tainted Viewpoint,"Maritza Corrales is a Cuban expert on the Jewish community, married to an American-born half-Jewish man. She is a lovely woman and a scholar; he a devoted follower of Castro and ardent Communist. While she presents many facts, figures and anecdotes in a very proper academic manner, I believe anything she says is suspect. Read this book to get further information and insight, but please read with a very powerful filter."
2,Blisters. Ouch!,"I had ordered a half a size less than I traditionally wear based on the sizing chart offered on the product page, however, the boot is still another half size larger than suggested. The hard heals also make my foot very prone to blisters even after walking only a mile. I would not wear these hiking again. They ruined a hike in Maine this summer. I do like the worn leather though. They look great."
3,so so,Not as good as I was hoping. Have not yet found anything as comfortable from day one as my Wolverine boots.
2,Felt cheap and laces are weird,"I thought the quality of this boot was lacking. They were stiff and felt cheap. Also, the lacing is really weird: two of the lacing holes on either side are not the usual metal rings you'd expect; the laces go through loops of leather. This makes it difficult to pull the laces tight or loosen them when you want to take the boots. off. I don't recommend."
4,True classic horror!,"Loved this film! It sends your imagination on a grisley, dark tour. Dr. Phibes was very well directed and easily compares to todays horror titles. Vincent Price shows us how we would seek our own revenge by violin!"
3,Interesting.,"I love Vincent Price, and he was pretty good in this. The murders were visually stunning and Vulnavia played her part well. If horror is your thing, see this,"
3,Question about the new video,"I'm hoping MGM has restored the original music to this new VHS release. Does anybody know? The version that's been running on Pay Cable for years has SUBSTITUTED the opening organ music (and other music), which seriously hurts the movie."
2,Memories sometime fail us,I remember PHIBES as being terribly scary when I first saw it.So when I saw this DVD I had to grab it to relive childhood memories....HMMMM......... ever noticed how many things are not as great as you remember them being when you were younger ?PHIBES was one of them.I guess as an 8 year old it was a great movie.... seeing it now it is simply another casualty of the 70's when too many movies were ruined by CAMP.
1,DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS DVD,"MGM Midnite Movies, not to put too fine a point on it, stink! I bought this DVD at Best Buy and it didn't play. I returned it and got another one - and it didn't play. I tried a third time - and it didn't play. They actually had to give me my money back. So, then I see it at Amazon.Com. I bought it. It didn't play. I exchanged it, it didn't play. I finally had to send it back to get a refund. Is anyone awake at the quality control at MGM?I have not problems with the movie - I think they are great (incidentally, the Dr. Phibes Rises Again has the same problem), it's the DVD's that are bad.I thought it might be my DVD player - nope - nothing wrong with it. None of them played on any DVD player (we even tried ones at Best Buy)."
2,"Classic Film, Bad DVD","This is a cult-classic!Unfortunately, it was released on a disc ofpoor quality.It won't play in any of my DVD-players.Not Happy"
4,A very scary movie.,"Considering when this was made, it has to be one of the scariest movies I have ever seen without using to much gore to do it. This movie will scare anyone trying to watch it. Just when you think you cannot stand being scared any longer, you cannot stop watching it, the story line keeps bring you back. As for Vincent Price he is excellent in any movie he is in."
4,Abominable,"Dr. Phibes is one of Vincent Prices greatest roles even though he never actually speaks, his voice being dubbed in after the filming of scenes. The deaths of his victims puts John from Saw to shame, though not as gory, way more diabolical. The visuals are amazing and Dr. Phibes plays a hell of an organ when he isn't inciting biblical plagues or drinking through the side of his neck. Just an all around great movie and well worth watching."
1,A Price-less waste of money...,"I have very fond memories of growing up and watching Vincent Price movies with my grandmother. The Abominable Dr. Phibes was one that left a major impression on me and is still one of my all-time favorite movies.HOWEVER...I have rated this amazing movie 1 star because this MGM Midnite Movies line is a collosal waste of money no matter how much or little you pay for it. This is the 3rd time I've tried one of these DVDs and it doesn't play past the 10 seconds of the MGM lion roaring. If you can find this, or any other classic horror movies for that matter, on a line other than MGM Midnite Movies, I HIGHLY recommend it. Otherwise, don't get your hopes up."
5,One of the Vincent Price classics - fantastic,"I actually saw this at a drive-in when I was a kid. Years later I'd run home from school if it was the features 3:30pm movie - such fun times before VCR's and discs, not to mention streaming video! It's a Vincent Price classic, and one of his best. Campy, fun and an enjoyable film to watch. It's Price at his best! If you like classic horror films, unique and original plots, or anything with Price, watch this movie."
2,There have been better reads...,"...than this book. A friend recommended it to me and I thought I was in for a good read. Not the case. The characters were just so-so, the plot was pretty transparent, and the ending left me neither anxious to read another book by the author nor dreading it. Like I said, there are better books."
4,Go Charlie!,"Charlie Sexton is a prolific song writer. His lyrics tell stories and he orchestrates his music around them. I'm a fan of his from the Arc Angel days. HIs solo efforts have never disappointed me. I'm a guitar guy, but I love Charlie's music. He plays guitar very well, but I think his concentration is on his lyrics and then building the music. If you like the Arc Angels and Doyle Bramhall II, you can't go wrong with Charlie Sexton."
2,Didn't work as expected.,"The sound quality is fine, but the functionality is inconsistent. It works so intermittently that it's not worth the trouble. It may work better for you, but I didn't like it."
2,USB VOIP Skype Phone,This phone worked fine for a couple of months. Now the keypad doesn't work but I can still make calls from the PC and use the phone to talk. I would typically make a call from my Skype address book so it's not a big deal.
1,Dont bother!,What a dissapointment....Software wanted to install its own operating system and caused me grief to no end.I un-installed the software and canned the phone.Dont waste your money here
4,Great Simple Little Phone,"This phone was very easy to install. I had to make a slight adjustment to the sound system settings in my computer but I was up and running within about 5 minutes. Plugs into the USB port and is very handy. The size of a cell phone. The only negative I would say about this phone is that the ringer is not loud enough for me. I wish it rang louder. But otherwise I am very pleased with this phone. It was inexpensive, so I really didn't expect much. To my surprise it is a great little phone for the price."
1,Poor Mac functionality,"Although the description says it works on Mac, it only does so poorly. You cannot locate a Mac driver for the phone for love nor money. You can use the phone if you control everything via Skype itself, but you cannot dial directly from the phone as advertised. I hear the phone works well on Windows, so this review shouldn't discourage Windows users from purchasing it. However, its Mac compatibility is light on the ability. I would not recommend this for Mac users."
1,Never received product but was charged,I have contacted the company but with no response - never received the product but was billed - probably will not use Amazon. com again.
2,"Quality is not good..,",After three weeks I received this product. The smaller size Ottoman was packed inside the bigger size Ottomon. They were light weight and the bigger size Ottomon has a large crack inside. We are scared to use this piece since it may break any time. Manufacturer should make this unit more reliable and provide separate packages for each Ottoman.
4,Great Fun!,"As a closeted rock historian, well I'm a disenfranchised ex punk rocker (hardcore punk, not the silly crap they have today). I totally got into this book. It's funny and I almost passed a few kidney stones one night on the toilet laughing so hard. I didn't have kidney stones before I started laughing, so you can tell it was a rather long laugh.It doesn't suck, you do."
1,Dumbest,Neal Pollack should do the reading world a favor and quit writing. How can a writer so untalented and witless get published? He writes like a vanity-press hack. I predict that a decade from now he will be a footnote to a footnote to a footnote.
2,Never Mind Never Mind the Pollacks,"Tom Clancy meets Leo Strauss with a dash of homoeroticism. Basically, it's the life story of Uday Hussein, as told through the eyes of a fictitious sister, Pussay. It begins with Uday as a dictator's spoiled kid and follows him as he grows into a dictator's psychotic son whom everyone fears. His idea of a good time is shooting live ammunition into restaurants' chandeliers. That or kidnapping young Iraqi women off the street. Not a very sympathetic character. Sort of Veruca Salt meets Sonny Corleone meets Scarface meets Caligula."
2,Weak attempt to hang a novel on a great title,"Neal Pollack proves with this novel that he's at his best when working in the short form. The ""Catching Up with Neal Pollack"" and discussion questions are the funniest parts of the paperback edition. Pollack fails to mine his rich comic premise of its full potential. He doesn't explore the opportunities for genuinely inspired humor in any of the scenes he depicts, choosing instead to fall back on the same tired formula: Pollack parties with rock stars, says obnoxious but unfunny things, and vomiting ensues. This is just lazy writing, and the author is capable of much better when he's comfortable with the form in which he is operating. That said, I really liked the ending."
5,Excellent Viking Metal,"This album is amazing. There may be only five songs but they are all spectacular, epic masterpieces. Although this does get categorized as Black Metal, thematically it focuses more on true paganism than the satanic paganism that many Black Metal bands focus on. This is probably why the phrase ""viking metal"" was coined to desribe this.The album is quite long for the number of songs (an average of 10 minutes per song) and the band's style is also quite repetitive. What makes this album work are the varying guitar and synth melodies that hide underneath the wall of guitars. This allows repeated passages to grow grander with each repetition.My personal favourites are ""Vetrarnott"" and ""Norvegr"", the former because its wonderful vitality is so empowering and the latter because of its beautiful, sorrowful melodies.I haven't gives Hordanes Land as much time and although it is good ""Vikingligr Veldi"" is the real star of this compilation.Metalheads, buy this NOW!"
4,It works but only by heresay,"Bought this, a fire and ice and a chartreuse and white. Bought this cuz I fish in a small pond for practice primarily so this might entice some finicky bass. Also this is the only one with a colorado blade on it. I have seen a guy pull 13 bass in a two hour period froom this same pond using this bait. However I recieve a black and chartreuse bait with a painted green blade. Haven't had a chance to use cuz I havent fished at night when this would be useful. However I would recommend this for small ponds and just go bigger for lakes. Booyah is my favorite spinnerbait. But buy from Walmart instead of here. The above spinnerbaits plus some berkely earthworm cost me 36 with shipping. Buy from Walmart and good fishing to you!"
2,disappointed,"Knowing that it would be impossible to contain any of the drama of an epic like KRISTIN LAVRANSDATTER in one DVD, I didn't expect a lot from this offering. I bought this item out of curiosity. I am sure that Norwegian, Liv Ullman, understands the characters better than I do, even though I've read the book 4 times in 40 years...and made pilgrimages to the book's locations....but, the casting was terrible...come on!! Erlend had gold teeth in the 13th century?"
3,Big disappointment,"It lacks fluidity and the acting was over-dramatic without creating emotional impact to the viewers. Expected high craftmanship since it was directed by Liv Ullman. The only redeeming factor for this movie is the beautiful scenery. I have to agree with one review here that Erlend looks like Chuck Norris. Not really the kind of handsome, magnetic personality you think for a knight in shining armour. If this was done by the directors of the Lord of the Rings or ""The Last of the Mohicans"" movies, this would be a total classic for a film. Inspite of the movie below par, I will still read the books. I hope it will be entertaining just like the Pillars of the Earth by Ken Follett."
3,Bergmanesque tale of love,"Loving the complex tapestries of a woman's life in the novel, I was gravely disappointed in the film.The novel's complex theme--of how sexual passion and personal choices complicate the clear lessons of logic and religion, but in the end point to a higher meaning-- are degraded into a tale of sexual repression and lust in a harsh and unforgiving land.This might be a forgivable simplification, but for the problem of miscasting.The Clintonesque Erland, who is brave and charming to all women but lacks depth of character, has little similarity to the dull and not very handsome lover in the film.Similarly, the klutzy but faithful fiance is shown in the film as a handsome charming fellow, making one wonder what got into the girl to reject him.However, I must say my daughter in law, who does not know the novels, enjoyed this greatly. If you like Bergman, buy the film. If you like Undset, forget it."
4,Great Book,I thought this book was great. it was easy to read and it really hit home on some important issues. i think the author has a great way with words and knows his stuff! i'm looking forward to more books by Dr. Allison.
1,Not worth the money,This runs EXTREMELY small and the fabric is so thin that it has no body. It really LOOKS cheap. Usually you get what you pay for.... not this time.
3,"Not her best, but still good","I am a huge fan of Jodi Picoult's books and have probably read about six or seven of them. I would have to say that this is probably my least favorite of her books that I have read so far. Although it wasn't the best, it was still a good read.My main dislike of this book was the main character, Nina. Similar to the mother in Picoult's ""My Sister's Keeper,"" she was just cold and unlikeable to me. I really didn't care what happened to her. I just wanted her son and husband to be okay.I would still recommend it, but if you haven't read her other books, read those first!!"
2,Disappointing,"Like many of the reviews here, I have also read many of Jodi's books and most of them I love, this one just wasn't up there. Whilst this is a promising story, Jodi does not live up to her usual expectations in this book. I won't go into the books plot, as that is covered in the dust jacket.The son's actions were irritating so he did not generate as much sympathy as he deserved - the idea behind his actions were good, but just didn't work in this intance. The mothers character is so annoying I found it difficult to finish the book. I couldn't muster any sympathy for her, she is made out to be such a clever woman, yet she acts like such a dunce - disappointing."
1,Couldn't make my way through this one!,"I purchased this book at a local book store, looking forward to the great reading experience I had come to expect from Jodi Picoult. What a disappointment! I read about halfway through, thinking, after having read My Sisters Keeper and Handle With care, both of which were excellent books, that surely it would get better. It didn't. Finally, I put it aside, and have no interest in finishing it. I've read several Picould books, and, other than the two named here, all have been disappointing. I don't expect to purchase more."
2,Rated R,"I liked how this book was written from different points of view and how the subject matter was thought-provoking. However, I did not like this book as well as Picoult's My Sister's Keeper. It was also difficult for me to read on a personal level due to my experience working with sexually abused children. This book contains some sex, bad language, and enough F words to classify it as rated R if made into a movie."
1,Not So Perfect,"I loved ""Plain Truth"" and set out to read everythingby Jodi Picoult. If there IS another book of thatquality in her other novels please tell me. Perfect Matchstarts out as a page turner, gets absolutely disgustingas Nina becomes a vigilante---something totally farfetchedfrom an officer of the court. Through a contrived plottwist her actions become even more repulsive. It's veryhard to identify with a supposed experienced attorney whodoesn't bother to seek out credible evidence before takingthe law into her hands. The cold husband and puppy dogpoliceman add little to the story however the latter atleast is not completely offensive in his actions. Theending was bizarre and seemed as contrived as the rest ofthe book.Sign me as hoping that Ms. Picoult has another Plain Truthin her. This is not even close.Lisa Nyberg"
3,Perfect Match Jody Picoult,"This wasn't the best book she has ever written in my opinion but it was interesting. The DNA evidence facts were new to me--very interesting! I found the protagonist extremely annoying however, of course she was hysterical when she learned what had happened to her son but I just felt her reactions were way overwritten even as she was presenting herself as rational."
2,"WELL--READING THIS--KILLED A FEW DAYS, ANYWAY",THE FIRST 100 PAGES--I WAS DOING SOME SERIOUS HEAD-SCRATCHING.WHERE IS SHE GOING WITH THIS. I WAS FIGURING EVERYTHING OUTWAY BEFORE WE GOT THERE. THE LAST 100 PAGES---WOW---IT READ LIKE300 PAGES---LET'S GO---LET'S GET ON WITH IT!! AND NINA---DIDN'T LIKE HER AT ALL.
2,"The only ""miss"" on a list of winners by this author.","Jodi Picoult is one of my all-time favorite authors, but she misses the mark on this book: her ""heroine"" isn't heroic. She's a bitchy, over-worked, non-maternal misguided woman, who does what she does for the wrong reasons. I don't like her, I don't like her actions and the only part of the book I can sympathize with is the indictment of the way our criminal justice system prosecutes pedophiles. Skip this one, but buy every single other one that Ms. Picoult has to offer, including the latest, Second Glance. They're all wonderful, thought provoking and filled with truly three-dimensional, likeable, human (warts and all) characters."
2,"Ho hum, couldn't be bothered","This was my first Jodi Picoult novel and I am still undecided as to whether it will be my last. There is no doubt that this author can write, her literary talent is huge! But the fact is that I just couldn't feel engaged with the protagonist Nina Frost at all. She seemed like the cliched strong/hard high-flying legal woman perpetuated by so many crime shows. Yawn. I simply didn't care about what happened to her, and in fact couldn't be bothered finishing the book, although it started out so well."
3,So-so,"I have read a number of Picoult's novels. This was not one of her better books. It drags in the beginning. I found the main character annoying. The parts of the book which were from the point of view of the child seemed unrealistic. The topic was interesting. A mother takes the law into her own hands after her 5 year old is raped repeatedly by a priest. But the way that Picoult handled the trial and the ending seemed forced.Read the book if you have nothing better to read, it isn't that bad. But I recommend Nineteen Minutes and My Sister's Keeper instead. They are just better stories."
3,Book Drags On and On.....,"This book was twice as long as need be. The story loses its hold with all the dribble in between.A mom who shoots the person who molests her child is a hero to me. We all know how pathetic and unjust our judicial system is for the victims. Fiction or not, that part of the story intrigued me.Overall the book is just a dud."
4,"Tough topic, great story","I enjoyed Perfect Match despite the very difficult subject matter. Nina may be an unsympathetic heroine, but I found her quite real--cynical about the legal system she works within, torn at times between her love of career and love of family, accustomed to being in charge. The Library Journal review calls her ""truly dislikable,"" but I found that unfair. If she were a man, would she be judged so harshly? The subplots--particularly the whole Patrick puppy love business--rang much less true. But in general, I found the main characters ""whole"" and well drawn, the pace good, and the narrative structure interesting and useful as a way to share the perspectives of the family members dealing with the great horror and sadness of the abuse."
3,NOT HER BEST,I REALLY LIKE HER WRITING. MY SISTER'S KEEPER WAS AMAZING. BUT THIS BOOK WAS JUST OK. THE WRITING WAS GOOD IT WAS A FAST READ BUT THE STORY LINE WENT FROM GOOD TO RIDICULOUS. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY SHE TOOK THE LAW IN HER OWN HANDS BEFORE SEEING WHAT WOULD HAPPEN BUT I LET THAT SLIDE. THE VERDICT WAS NOT VERY REALISTIC CONSIDERING THE LAB REPORT.BUT THEN WHAT THE HUSBAND SUPPOSEDLY DID WAS JUST RIDICULOUS. A GROWN MAN WOULD HAVE TO INGEST 1/2 GALLON OF THE STUFF TO KILL HIM. NOW HOW THE HELL DO YOU GET SOMEONE TO DO THAT?! I THOUGHT THAT WAS SO STUPID.
2,Awful!,"I have really enjoyed most of Picoult's book, but this one is absolutely awful. What an unbelievable premise and the main characters reaction to the murder of a preach was absurd. The ending was also ridiculous. Please! Do not waste your time."
1,How desperate was I to read this book?,"I tend to only write reviews when I'm mad at myself for finishing a book, and here I go again. Why did I keep on reading? It started out that I'd wanted a good, gripping story, since I'd been doing a lot of heavy reading. I loved My Sister's Keeper, and thought I'd give another of Picoult's books a go. Well, I should have heeded the other 1 star Amazon reviews, which I just reread now. I agree with all of them. The main character Nina was completely unlikable and the story line preposterous: her son is abused, she accuses her husband of the abuse, kicks him out, finds she was sorely mistaken, and he comes back and is still in love with her? That is just the start of the silly plot line. I like a trashy story every once in a while but this was just plain silly.. and pretty predictable as well. I'm done with Jodi Picoult."
2,Not for me,"This book convinced me that I'm no longer a Jodi Picoult reader. I get why some people would like it--the flowery imagery and heart-wrenching subject matter pulls at the heart; but I found the book to be overwritten and sensational. Besides, I couldn't identify with the main character who would add trauma to her already traumatized son by taking the law into her own hands. Picoult is known for her ability to end the story with an unforeseen twist and to effectively use various points of views; I guessed every twist in the book well in advance and I felt like each character had the same emotive voice, even the construction-worker husband. I like women's fiction, but this was a bit too much."
4,Not my favorite...,"I have to preface this review by saying that my least favorite Jodi Picoult novel is still nothing less than brilliant. I was quickly sucked up into this story, as I am with all of Ms. Picoult's books; however, I found myself yelling at the book a couple of times and muttering ""Come. On.""I found the protaganist, Nina, to be a supremely selfish woman. The straw that broke this camel's back was her reaction to (oopsy) shooting and killing the wrong man. Why should she get away with murder when her clients can't??Also, I could guess that the ""father"" Nathaniel was pointing at was most likely a priest. This brilliant lawyer couldn't? Finally, her poor, poor husband. She almost seemed happy to accuse him of molesting her son. Hello? Does she love her husband at all?Ok. I'll stop the tirade, although I could go on.For the most part, this book was a gripping read, informative and exciting. Usual, great Picoult-concocted mixture of romance, mystery and courtroom drama"
1,Over the top,"I did not like anything about this one. Talk about going over the top in being unable to write even one character that would be believable. A too perfect 5-yr old, a workaholic mother that turns into an obsessive mommy, a wienie husband, an even bigger wienie love interest, a social worker/babysitter...just not one person to like. Throw them in with a plot that goes from strange to downright unbelievable and you've got a book that merits very little time or attention.This was my 2nd Picoult book and I must say I was very disappointed. The first (Second Glance) was what inspired me to try another of hers. I think I'll wait awhile before (IF) I risk it again."
1,Very disappointing,"This is the only Picoult book I've read. Someone recommended her and I am always glad to find new authors. I had high hopes. This book was just dreadful. I could tell it was pretty bad early on, but I kept reading... thought it would improve. I didn't, I just should have stopped reading. I might try one more Picoult book but I won't keep slogging through if it doesn't seem better than this one. What a waste of time !!!"
2,Unrealistic,"This book was great till the DNA sample came back which changed the entire book from something exciting to a story that was boring and obvious. Nina deserved a lot more punishment then what she recieved, special treatment and luck was what she got in return for killing an innocent man! The characters were unrealistic and superficial and the theme had unreal consequences."
2,Not a perfect match for me,"For some reason, I'm having a very hard time connecting with any of the characters in this book. The subject matter and some of the moral questions that you're forced to ask yourself are intriguing but that's where the intrigue ends. Can someone please tell me how it ends? I really can't force myself to read another page.....Update - I just skimmed that last 1/3 of the book so I could see how it ends. IMO the ending is very disappointing and doesn't really make sense. I'd LOVE to go into details but I don't want to spoil it for the next unfortunate person to read this book. Total waste of my time. Never again will I purchase a book from barnes and noble without the benefit of having online reviews to ""guide"" me."
2,poor charaterization & riduculous ending,"I've read most of picoults novels..to me she has great plots but very corny descrpitions of emotions and often un believable characters.""Perfect Match"" started with an interesting and realistic premise.. child sexual abuse , the legal system and the church.However, about 100 pages in it went off the rails....I know im in the minority with this opinion"
4,Moral delimma I never want to face,This is a heartwrenching book for a parent to read. You repeatedly ask yourself if you would be driven to the same actions as Nina. The twist about the killer makes this book hard to put down. I subtracted one star because I doubt if the sentence handed down is realistic. A great read.
5,Perfect Match,I received this novel in the time expected and am looking forward to reading it along with the other Jodi Picoult novels I have purchased. I am intrigued by Jodi's voice and the way she presents her characters. Every one of them becomes a friend or acquaintance. Her scenes and storylines are delicious. I savor every word and nuance long after I've read the book. To say I am a fan is putting it mildly.I'm so glad my sister introduced me to Jodi and I now recommend her work to everyone.I appreciate this opportunity to acknowledge my enthusiasm for this extremely talented author.Irene
3,Not my favorite.........,"I've read many Jodi Picoult books. Though I do love them, I found that you can't read too many in a row. They are way too similar.Nina Frost an attorney who works with children who have been molested, finds herdelf in a difficlt sittuation (to say the least) when her own son gets molested. And by a priest no less. So what does this brilliiant attorny do? She shoots the preist!This one took me about two months to read because it was very dull in the middle. Or maybe I'm just a know it all amd thougt I had this book pegged. After her son got mollested, I thought they catch the guy send him to jail. Right? Wrrong! She shoots him. So then i thought she'll get a really good atterney and get ou free. Was I right or was I right?There was the issue with the wrong DNA crap. But that was only to supply Picoult with the surprise ending she always has.So all in all not a terrible read just very predictable."
2,Skimmed the ending,"I really like Jodi Piccoult's writing, however, this book became quite draining at the end. I found I had no interest in even finishing the book so I skimmed the last 30 pages. I had come this far so I thought I might as well finish. Come to think of it, I also skimmed the end of 19 minutes. I read The Pact all the way through but resigned myself to the fact that I already knew what was going to happen but was hoping I was wrong. I think I read the end of Change of Heart but I cannot recall. Either way, something keeps bringing me back to Piccoult's books (I think it b/c they are so well researched) because I am currently reading Handle with Care - let's see what the last 50 pages hold. I have committed to ""reading"" the end of this one."
5,Difficult questions,"After I've once picked up this book it was very difficult to stop reading. I'd earlier read ""Everything for my sister"" in Swedish, but I couldn't find any other books by Jodi Picoult in my language, that's why I read it in English. And I don't have any regrets for that! Books, if possible, should be read in the language they've been written.Jodi Picoult writes about our worst nightmares in a way that it never gets phatetic or too much. She's always keeping balance.I sincerely recommend her books!Monica Nilsson, Sweden"
4,Good dialogue,"Two Girls and a Guy was a movie I misseed while I was graduating high school and I remembered hearing about it but just saw it now. I found it pretty good.....was expecting a crazy 3some with the NC-17 rating but the sex scene was pretty decent atleast there was some tongue involved and actually lasted more than 30 seconds unlike the ""R"" rated movies of today which there are no sex scenes anymore. Heather Graham was adorable as always and I liked the other girl too. Robert Downey Jr. did a great job as a typical womanizer and actually did manage to wrangle himself out of this one(somewhat) except he learned a few things he didn't want to know in the process. I am glad I watched it and had a good time...."
5,Two Girls Is Incredible,"The film is not directed in anyway towards a type of audience that is the slighteset bit immature towards such subjects as discussed in this film. From the beginning, the emotion put in by Robert Downey Jr. and Heather Graham are amazing. The acting is some of the best seen from Jr. and is the best seen from Graham. Wagner also held her own as the cute 2nd girlfriend. The film was highly enjoyable and definitly worth seeing."
3,I liked it. The cast was in sync with one another.,"The acting was very good, however, the one thing that stood out to me was that after they(girls) confronted him(Blake) the content of tne ensuing argument was clearly concived by a man alone. If RDJr. was not in this movie I would not have watched it. The cast salvaged an inadequate script, though it too had its moments. WATCH IT. If you like RDJr. You'll love this."
2,somewhat interesting failure,"Slice of life dramas are an increasingly rare phenomenon in contemporary cinema. A film like ""Two Girls and a Guy"" (What? No pizza place?) doesn't go very far in remedying the situation however. It's way too stodgy to inspire viewers to seek out other, perhaps more successful examples of the genre. The cast is impressive, the dialogue reasonably intelligent, but it drags so, you'll be relieved when it finally draws to an inconclusive end. Worth seeing for the acting, but ultimately solid performances are not enough to carry this tedious film."
1,Was this really a movie?,"Where did this movie go? What took place in the end? Well I sure as heck couldn't tell anyone. Robert Downey Jr. gives the best performance he could, given the watered down script and plot.Here's the movie in a few quick seconds.1) Two girls find out they share a boyfriend.2) They confront him, and all start yelling screaming.3) One girl has sex with the guy, while other listens.4) Other girl, who listened offers to date both of them and instead of being a 'couple' they can become a 'triple'.5) Guy leaves to see his mom, brunette girls also leaves seperately, and blonde girl stays in the guys apartment.6) Guy comes back crying, due to his mother passing away. Blonde girl comes to console, he sits at piano and play while she rests her head on his shoulder.CREDITS ROLE.????????????????????????????????????????????????????????HELLO????? What the heck??????? Dumb, pointless!"
3,Amusing,Amusing tale of a man and his dreams of a menage a troi set in his NYC apartment. The film makers sure saved on location fees.
1,False advertising,Amazon advertises this title as rated NC-17 but the DVD of the movie is rated R. I wsnted the NC-17 version!
2,Why NC-17?,"The biggest and probably most obvious reason that watched this movie was because of the title. When it said, ""The following feature is rated NC-17..."", I thought I was in for a real erotic treat. I sat through the entire movie and thinking it might have not been the NC-17 version but rather an R version. This is not the only reason I disliked the movie. We were not given enough background regarding Blake Allen's (RDJ)mother. Why was he so unnaturally attached to her? Also, who did he inherit his magnificent loft from? (Which was the main reason I rated this movie 2 stars. I loved his loft!)Why did Carla (HG)and Lou (NGW)stick around? They should have called this movie ""Two Girls Fight With A Guy, Then Forgive Him For Cheating"""
5,I love New York,"Juvenile male fantasy about getting away with it. Hard to believe James Toback is a grown man! Blake's two girlfriends are very upset with his two-timing, and yet he is so irresistable that one of the women drags him upstairs for some hanky panky and the other (conveniently bisexual) one suggests they all get it on together. The best explanation for this is that if you are a typical New York chick (like me), the rare opportunity to have sex in a 2500 sf loft with lots of windows is too good to pass up. The movie's big orally fixated sex scene left me cold, but Robert Downey Jr.'s apartment sent me into an erotic frenzy. I still fantasize about it during sex. Nice hardwood floors. Ceiling fan. Mmmmm...Robert Downey Jr. also has a nice bike that I would like to steal. Five stars for Robert Downey Jr.'s apartment."
3,Fine Black Comedy,"A black comedy that is more serious than most, this is a fine look at self-delusion in a relationship. As you watch, ask yourself: who is the most delusional of these three people, and how does that affect how the plot progresses? Fine performaces by all three actors (good to see Wagner in something a little lengthier after her small part in ""High Fidelity""). A little talky for some people's tastes, but works beautifully in the enclosed space of the loft. Beautifully filmed, with great use of corners, mirrors, and a rice-paper door. Good commentary track, though a little too jokey during some interesting dramatic parts."
4,a realistic review,"i first watched this movie when it came out. at the time i thought it was amazing, rdj's acting in particular. i thought the story was interesting, the dialogue quit and witty.i've recently started working my way through rdj's movies and watched this again on friday. my opinion is almost exactly the same. i think heather graham and natasha gregson wagner are a little...fake in parts, wagner in particular. but i'm a fan of both actresses and the dialogue is still good.as a huge fan of rdj i find the movie amazing. the film almost comes off as play with the constant dialogue and single location. if you're a fan of rdj, you will definitely like this movie, for his soliloquy in front of the mirror, hamlet recitation, piano playing and singing.that said, don't expect a complex (or even much of a) plot. and the ending is ambiguous, at least to me. but if you want to see rdj do some stellar acting, this movie is definitely worth watching."
1,Not even Robert Downey Jr. could make this movie good,"I do believe this is the most pointless movie ever made....i am a huge fan of Robert Downey Jr. and at some times in this horrible movie his quirkiness did shine through however, it was so boring and besides Downey, the acting was atrocious...i was furious that i wasted a dollar on renting this. I would have much rather had a double cheeseburger from McDonald's. Also i have no idea why every other review praises Natasha Wagner's performance in this. She is by far the worst actor in the movie. She has no emotion in her voice and she is annoying."
1,"not good at all, in my humble opinion","okay... i rented this movie mainly because of its interesting title, and the things i read in ""Rolling Stone"" about it. but i found it to be a complete waste of time. i'll admit that the chaotic dialogue between the three main characters is at some points pretty entertaining, and the verbal revenge which the two girls exact upon the hapless bastard blake gave me something of a feminist rush, but that's about all the movie has going for it. i will conceed to the fact that robert downey jr. possesses a lot of talent, and he definitely does the only good acting in this film. however, the film itself seems to have no point whatsoever, and worse than that, it has one of those really annoying inconclusive non-endings. it might have redeemed itself if it had at least some good sex scenes... =D. But it doesn't even have those. i don't reccommend it."
1,THIS MOVIE IS A BOMB,"I cannot believe I wasted 90 minutes of my time on this movie.It was the worst movie I have ever seen. Do not waste yourmoney or time on this movie. The acting was horrible, and the conversation was pointless. The movie never went anywhere.I was extremely disappointed."
2,What?,"This movie was stupid. It had a bad plot. It was very pointless. The only good thing about this movie was Robert Downey Jr's acting which was why I gave it 2 stars. The other 2 were good. But The plot...I'm not even gonna' start with the plot. The whole movie was stupid. I also don't get why this got an NC-17 rating. I don't want any dumb reviewer bad mouthing me just cause I don'get why this movie got an NC-17, I'm just wandering why it got it? It doesn't have any nudity or strong sexualy explicit nude scenes or what ever you call it.Unless if it was for that scene between Jr and Graham then that is dumb.Over all if you like dumb comedies go and watch it..Later"
1,The Worst Movie Ever Made,Honestly I cannot think of a worse movie. The acting was truly embarrassing and the plot didn't exist. Don't waste your time.
1,another one bites the dust,"me and my friend were looking for a movie to watch the other day, and we saw this title, in the comedy section of the video store, of all places. This movie is anything but a comedy. this movie is more like a peice of junk that the actors probably wish they had never done. I know that if I was in this movie I would be enbarassed beyond beilef. There are many things wrong with this movie and one of them is the language, it was awful. it was so bad that it drew your attention away from the rest of the dialog, another is the characters there are not really people like this in the world who would just sit around and talk about the kind of things that are discused in this movie instead o being billed as a comedy, this movie should of been billed as a list of insults to call people. In less you like bad language and lots of talk don't see this film."
5,honest and compelling,"Robert Downey, Jr. displays once again, his tremendous talent and his ability to take the audience along on an emotional journey. The dialogue was honest and true to life, and Mr. Downey dominated each scene he was in, as he normally does. He not only displays his acting talent here, but the scene in which he stares in the mirror and takes a good look at himself is one of the most riveting I have ever seen. Any fan of Downey's, James Toback, or of honest films about relationships will love this one! The claustrophobic sets add to the suspense and edge of your seat quality of the film.The humor is edgy and nervous, like the characters themselves.On the whole, an intelligent, worthwhile film!"
4,Robert Downey's best performance!,"Excellent movie, but this is not the typical Hollywood movie. No action. I can tell you a lot of good things about this movie, but the best thing is that you can see and confirm that Robert Downey Jr. is a fantastic actor. The variety of scenes where he laughs, cries, sings, argues, even performs a Shekespeare's act --they are all excellent. Really funny movie with great acting from Downing!"
3,MY GOD HOW THIS MOVIE IS ANNOYING......BUT STILL GOOD!,"Okay, as soon as the film ended I was like ""is that the end?"" and that sort of crushed the movie for me. I also would have liked to know more about Rob and his mother a little more because most of that part of the movie made no sense. Otherwise, a few good laughs and some good acting. Robert Downey was hilarious in some scenes. All in all, its a mediocre movie that wont give you anything beyond its cover purpose."
2,A great big disappointment,"The critics panned this movie, but the premise interested me so much that I just had to see it. I was largely disappointed. Heather Graham was lovely and stylish as usual, and Robert Downey Jr. was wacky and weird as usual, but that wasn't enough to carry the film. The ending left me thinking, ""What was the point?"" This movie is not worth buying, or even renting."
2,Ehh...,"It was okay, I guess...I liked the music and the heavy-petting sex scene with Robert Downey and Heather Graham was pretty hot and this director is knowned for these scenes;I acted it out with my girlfriend, so not a bad movie.Other than that, it pretty much sucked."
1,Unbelievable rubbish,"Badly acted, poorly written, abysmal direction and shoddy camerawork - and those are the highlights.Quite simply the worst film I have seen in a long time."
2,At least Robert Downey Jr was in it,"I rented this movie solely because I love Robert Downey Jr. Right away I was irritated with the other two girls (Heather Graham and someone else I've never seen before). Their performance was terrible, some of the worst acting I've seen. Luckily I didn't have to see too much of just the two of them (or else I would have turned it off), and RDJr came in. A hugely talented actor, RDJr saved this movie! I feel sorry for RDJr because of what he had to work with. An endless conversation with these two terrible actresses and a horrible ending? How does he pull that off? I don't know, but somehow he does. Not many other actors could have. 5 stars for RDJr, but the movie only gets 2."
1,3 people cast......fighting in an apartment,"Okay... this was the worst movie I have like EVER SEEN!! Those actors probably all regret making this movie. The whole 3 of them sit in a really nice apartment the whole time and fight, but then the one girls still screws around with the guy.. it was a completely pointless movie. I'm sure it was a VERY cheap movie to make because of they are in apartment the whole time and the cast is so small. I can't believe I wasted 1 hour and 40 minutes of my life on that movie.. It doesnt even deserve 1 star."
1,"Can you say ""acting lessons please""?","It was difficult to tell if Robert Downey Jr. has acting talent from this film. The bungling of the script by the two female leads was too distracting. In fact, the script itself was uninspiring and tedious. He had nothing to work with except a concept that was somehow twisted into a story with a spectacular 3 minute beginning and a shockingly disappointing middle. There was no ending to speak of. This film really earns zero stars."
1,"At first you hate it, then you hate it more","This movie must have been a part of Downey's community service for some drug conviction. In this movie, Graham and the other actress DEFINE poor acting. This movie is the ""before"" picture for an acting school somewhere... I'm sure of it. This is a story about a conflict where the viewer can't feel sorry for any of the characters. I felt sorry for myself for sitting through this cinematic disaster."
1,Waste of Time,"There is no acting in this film. All it is is 80 minutes of conversation between three people which sometimes becomes so unbearable , that i wonder why I just didnt switch the movie off!!"
1,90 minutes of my life have been stolen,"It seems that people who gave this movie a bad review got feedback that their opinions weren't helpful. Just because people gave this movie a bad review doesn't mean it isn't helpful. You know what, who cares because this really is a bad movie. Honestly, there is no point at all. Why would anyone watch a movie that goes nowhere and doesn't have a point? I'm just writing this review to save people with any common sense and stop them from wasting their valuable time. By the way, thanks to all the prospective people who will say my review isn't helpful. At least some people will appreciate it..."
3,"I sat stonefaced through ""Two Girls And A Guy"".","Fox has given ""Two Girls And A Guy"", a film that didn't strike me as exceptional in any way, a reasonably respectable presentation on DVD. A rental would probably be best for anyone interested in the film, but with most retailers carrying the disc in the $18-range, a sight-unseen purchase wouldn't break the bank."
2,Things that make you go hmmm...,"Blake is a mostly unemployed actor who sings a song called ""Call me daddy then bend over and squeal like the pig that you are"" to his agent over the phone. This might lead one to think Blake is not too smart. Not so! Blake has got two women convinced they are his one and only and have been for the past 10 months. Boy are they pissed. But Blake is nonplussed. All it takes is a little fake suicide, a Hamlet monologue, and a few dozen phone calls to his terminally ill mommy and voila! The girls are eating out of his hand. A good instructional manual for guys who would like to pull something like this, but be warned...you're no Robert Downey, Jr."
1,A ghastly piece of cinema,"After watching this movie, I was in a state of shock. How could someone (i.e. James Toback) allow this movie to happen? Didn't anyone tell him that he had just produced a gruesome, unwatchable piece of trash? Robert Downey Jr. is a skilled actor who is usually fun to watch, but this movie is so inane, I suspect he wishes that it wasn't on his resume."
1,Not a good movie,"I am usually a fan of small production movies but this is not a good choice. Do not buy it. If you want to see it, rent it. Not worth the money..."
1,One of the worst movies I have ever Seen,Too bad they dont let you put zero stars!! This is the worst movie I have seen in quite some time.
1,To Low A Dosage,"I bought this to use when my baby is born instead of the injection that they can get at birth. I took the bottle to my midwife today and she said that the dosage is too low. You are supposed to give infants 2mg of vitamin k per week for a certain number of weeks. This entire bottle contains enough vitamin k for just 1 dosage, while the drops my midwife uses contain the recomended dosage in just 2 drops. This vitamin k supplement supplies 55mcg (or .055mg)per dropper full, with 43 servings (droppers full) per bottle."
3,"Great quality, but not waterproof","I bought these for my 10 lb yorkie/silky mix. After a few times wearing them, she started licking her paws and I found the muttluks were rubbing sores on her paws around the area of the velcro. A week later she developed red bumps all over her body, which after a trip to the vet, we found she had a staff infection that were linked to sores caused by the muttluks. The muttluks are a great quality product, they stay on terrific and our dog doesn't mind having them on. We have found they are not waterproof when playing in snow and/or rain. As you can see, we have mixed feelings on this product."
4,Patience Required,This book is awesome! Just one thing though.. its pretty tough. Intermediate players beware this book will require patiences! Having the CD or listening to it on YouTube is a must to understand some of the feel of the songs.
1,Waste of money,"I first heard of Andy Suzuki while listening to Daniel Ho and also his band Kilauea. I loved his smooth sound and melodies. After looking up his name on the internet and noticing he had a CD out that I purchased. The CD is NOTHING like what I had previously heard him play. It is hard jazz with no melody and very stataco notes. Perhaps this is his style, but I also being a sax player will not buy another of his. No wonder this is his only CD, I doubt he has sold very many."
4,Nice Tips!,"As a new user of Acrobate 7.0, I am finding the tips and tricks in this book to be a substantial aid in getting me off the ground and running with the program. Highly recommend it!"
5,The Vetock Brothers,"A cult classic for sure. Follow the crazy Hermit, a lunatic butcher, outstanding cinematography and a story piece masterpiece Art Nouvea"" through a visual feast on the california coast. Some say paradise cove is an alien being ""eyeing"" the human world, for a futuristic film called ""The Nut House"", and eventually a trilogy entitled ""The Seventh Key"" and then others say it is a new age horror film, telling a majority of the film through visual and symbolistic imagery. Simulacra for those of you in the know. Are you smart enough for this film asks film critics magazine. Does this film break the barriers of story telling. Only the future will tell, says ""The Vetock Bros.""Enjoy!"
1,A Breed Apart a Tribute to The Hunting Dogs That Own Our Sou,"I was inspired by the compilation of bird dog stories found within this book. If you enjoy the excitement, fear, despair, and elation associated with the training, ownership and running of all breeds of bird dogs, you will enjoy this book. The authors help you relive the moments you have endured with your own dogs in addition to helping you imagine the hunts you have yet to experience. This is a definite must read for bird dog enthusiasts."
5,For Beginning Artist or Those Moving into Imagined Settings,"Imaginary settings, like fantasy novels, sometimes need to be anchored by a lot of realism. While emphasising getting the perspective of what you're looking at right, there is a tremendous amount here for the artist drawing what only exists in his or her imagination. The last section, frighteningly called ""Mechanical Perspective"" (anything mechanical is evil, right?), merely deals with how to start with an overhead plan and wind up with a sketch of the building or ship, inside or out."
2,Dated Perspective,"This book is well written and full of all the information you want to know about perspective, but it is also incredibly dated. It was published in the 20's and written in a language that is confusing and hard to read."
1,A Very Bad and Complicated book!!!!!!,"Ok, I brought this book years ago and hardly ever use it from the day i brought it. Why you ask? It is simply too complicated for a beginner like myself to understand what the author is trying to tell me. The example are very hard to understand and directions are also hard to follow.I was lost even on the first page.If you want a very good book that deals with perspective and for beginners and beyond get Perspective! for Comic Book Artists: How to Achieve a Professional Look in Your Artworkby David Chelsea. It is very entertainingand very useful book. And best of all the entire book lessons is taught on a comic format rather than a text book. SO dont watse you money and time on this book because there alot other good perspective that are out there waiting for you."
5,One of the Best,"I have read 7+ books on perspective and I believe the thouroughness of this book and its explanations make it the one book you could use above any other. It is comparable to G. A. Storey's book but is easier to understand and it fills in the gaps that other books take the reader's knowledge for granted. I would, however, suggest reading multiple books on perspective because many will explain certain things that others will take for granted and vis versa."
5,Captivating!,"I could not put this book down. I read it in one sitting! I received Book 2 Balaam's Error as a gift years ago and could not find Book 1, The Master's Quilt as it went out of print. I found it and the book did not disappoint! Finally I could read Book 2! Both books are awesome reads. Book 3, Song of the Seraphim will be released in ebook with the other two in October and hopefully in hard copy as well. Looking forward to finishing the trilogy, at last! Pick up all three, you will not be disappointed. The author's descriptions are vivid and his biblical understanding sound as he creates fictional characters that clearly explains these ""giants"" and their continual presence in the spirit realm as well as outline possibilities to the rise of the anti-Christ and provide rising anticipation to Christ's triumph over evil."
2,Security?,"This product is poorly made but I guess like the old saying goes, ""You get what you pay for"". If you have a toy pistol than this product will be ideal. The flexible hinge doesn't look very durable and probably will fail after time. This is the reason I rated it two stars."
3,Not bad!,Its not bad it does it's job....and it's compact! Fits anywhere and most hand guns...Its not bad it does it's job....and it's compact! Fits anywhere and most hand guns...
4,MTM pocket pistol case,What can you say. Holds my handgun. Good and tight. Easy open case when you need it but good and tight inside when closed. Price was right at Amazon. Kind of thin plastic and foam will fall out. But wow the price!! Just add some glue on the foam and use it.
5,My Gun Case,"In the past few weeks before I got this from Amazon, I was looking for a case or cases to store what I needed to store, I finally found it in Amazon. The product bought is very durable and strong. Makes a perfect fit for what I needed it for. Great product. Will need more in the future"
2,Much signal loss,"There are two electrical surfaces that much contact the cable. In the center is a metal pin, which pokes into the cable center. The outer wire sheet comes in contact with the screw. Bottom line is that so little metal comes in contact with the cable wires that there is tremendous signal loss. Volume loss is over 50%. I personally got about 30% signal, guesstimate. Not acceptable."
1,DECEPTIVE ADVERTISING,"I haven't seen deception like this for some time. The title description of the item uses the word cover; however the rest of the Description is specifically for a Ritchie Navigator Series compass. No where in the Description is it said that the item for sale is for a cover only, for the compass? I almost fell for the advertisement. I wanted to compare prices so I went to Defender Marine. Defender's price for the same Navigator Compass Item #802919, described on Amazon from Boaters World, is $229.99. Again one must remember ""Buyer Beware"", or you may get ""skinned"".I expect it was just a ""typo""."
3,Good Read !,"I needed a ""Clancy Fix,"" and chose this book to try and fill the void. While it didn't succeed, it was an exciting story...after a rather slow start. I'd rate it 3 1/2 STARS."
1,PJ wanna be writes book,"It is obvious that salazaar wants to be a PJ but never had the balls to try. So he seeks approval and admiration from the PJ community. He is a load blower on an aircraft in the AirForce, an MOS that would require him to know nothing about PJs or other operators. The book in my opinion reveals his struggle for acceptance. He even writes of a stud boy load master giving advice to the main PJ character! Another attempt to make people think load blowers are as cool as PJs! Dont waste money."
3,"Premonitions,Spooks and Action","A page-turning military mission in Bosnia that settles down after an awkward start and fills the remainder with action. Some Rambo like interludes with the locals annoy, but not bad for a first outing."
2,Action over literary efforts,"While full of action (the second half anyway), and genuinely told by one who has lived the like of a PJ, the book lacks much originality--the numerous cliches become very disenchanting and annoying, and there are grammaitcal errors which get in the way of a pleasent read."
1,"If you are a PJ wanabee, like me, don't buy this book","First thing: the guy that wrote this book is not a PJ! The bio statement makes it sound like he is but he is not, he is some kind of loadmaster or something. Second thing: in the military in general and spec ops in particular, there aint going to be no two guys in some kind of assasin/rescue squad type of thing out on thier own! It's all about the TEAM! Third thing: waste your money on a Playboy, not this book. You will get much better use out of it, and how."
1,Diskeeper - the 30-day wonder - avoid it!,"I purchased 2 copies of this in May, 2007 (one pro-premier version, one pro version). It installed and activated (or so it said) without any problems. The problem was that it requested reactivation frequently until, after 30 days, it was disabled.I contacted Diskeeper customer support and they said to download it again from their site and reactivate. I did, and the result was the same. This was repeated another 4 times: download, activate, and wait 30 days until it quit working. I suggested several times that I might be doing something incorrectly during the installation, but no help was forthcoming.Diskeeper has ignored my emails for assistance since mid-November. TERRIBLE customer service, although they frequently send emails wanting me to endorse the product or upgrade to the 2008 version.I've been dealing with computers and installing software for 40 years (yes, that's right, 40 years). I have never seen such poor customer service. Avoid it!"
5,Perfect Fit Airline,"These little planes are perfect for my Grandchildren to hold and play with. They are durable, small enough to travel, light enough for my Grandson to fly above his head like an airplane should. My Granddaughter likes to hold them and they are big enough not to fit into her mouth.This is the Perfect Fit Airline."
2,What Became of the Broken Hearted,"first and foremost I really enjoyed the movie having watched the ""Once Were Warriors"", however I was not aware that DVD's are encrypted for different regions. I was not able to play it on my DVD player. I would like to return it and get the right region for California."
3,DVD,"Ordered because we liked ""Once were Warriors"". I have been trying to find this sequel for a few years. Wasn't sure at first because the cover is all in Spanish. There are Spanish subtitles but the audio is in English"
5,Onyx Night Light Table Lamp,I LOVE this table lamp! I have NO regrets that I bought 2 of these for my new end tables.
1,JUST A BAD MOVIE,"THIS MOVIE IS JUST PLAIN BAD. I WAS GOING TO WRITE ABOUT THE MOVIE , BUT THE WHOLE THING IS JUST BAD"
4,GREAT All Ages Series,"If you're a Doctor Who fan, you know that series is targeted at a family audience (In theory at least, I think it's more for teens and adults.). Sarah Jane is very much for the kids. But for adults, it's still a helluva lot of fun. Smart scripts, talented young actors, the beautiful lady that is Ms. Sladen, and a daft tin dog that everyone loves. Pick this up, it's great for the kids and parents are going to have a good time with it too!"
5,Interesting BBC series,"I remember seeing some views of this program on a US cable channel and was curious about it. It was a BBC children's program, but I found it to be much better than the drivel they play on Nicklelodeon, Cartoon Network, Disney Channel or other cable channels. The acting and storylines were more mature for what is suppose to be a children's program and actually could be a primetime show in the US.I saw most of the other episodes and seasons that were available on Amazon Prime and was happy to watch most of them so far. The last season is currently not available and the principal actress, Elizabeth Sladen, passed away in 2011 from cancer. I watched the tributes to her on YouTube and was impressed with her personal characteristics and charm that she brought to the show."
4,I wasn't sure because you can't tell with spin-offs...,"First off, let's say this... I didn't grow up watching Doctor Who. In fact, only in its latest incarnation did I discover it. But having done that and loved it, I decided to watch the past episodes... and that's where I met Sarah Jane. She's smart and funny and fearless... everything I wish I could be.But this series is something the new Doctor Who isn't. It's a tween show. When Doctor Who first came out, it was intended for the younger audience. As it went on, it went beyond that. This series you can tell is really focused on the kids... In fact, three of the main characters are children. It's really fun and still has that hint of Doctor Who danger. I love it and would totally recommend it!"
3,"Doc fans, skip it unless reallllly board","I recognized SJ from some Doctor Who cross over ep. thought I would check it out. Other then it is slow, and pre-teen oriented, I have nothing against it. This is based only on Season 1 ep. 1,"
5,Cant get enough,What Can i say I just love this Series the characters the plots i just cant get enough of SJA. Before I Bought this I went back and watched some of the older DW episodes that contained Sarah Jane and the 3rd doctor. I have a new Respect for her now.Basically if you like Doctor Who and Torchwood you will like this as well. ^_^
5,Sarah Jane Adventures - GREAT VIEWING !!!,The Sarah Jane Adventures was a JOY to watch!Every show was CLEAN with no bad language or sexual content!Doctor Who was great and so was this show!I will buy more seasons of The Sarah Jane Adventures.My older grand children will be able to watch this show!Torchwood was rubbish! Don't buy Torchwood!Too bad they had to trash it up with language and sexual content!I bought it because someone recommended it to me.I also was told it got better later. NOT so much!I deleted ALL seasons of torchwood!
2,Children Only...,"Unless you have a very low IQ or are between the ages of 5 and 11, this series is not for you. I had not read the reviews before purchasing the 2 seasons and was very disappointed, to the point that there simply was no reason to watch any other episodes other than the 2 or 3 that I had already seen. Perhaps one day when I am totally bored out of my mind and want a nap, I might play the second season.For children, however, this should be excellent entertainment --- no sex, the special effects are amateurish and not very scary and it's specifically made to entertain tots...Take that into consideration before you purchase these..."
3,It's fine entertainment kids 6 to 10,"""The Sarah Jane Adventures"" is a spinoff from the BBC's ""Doctor Who"" series, targeted squarely at children over five.It's decent entertainment for the target audience. You'll be hard pressed to find other live action adventure shows that will give a child in the target age range as much satisfaction. Still, the series is very uneven. They have writers and directors who are trying in earnest to produce something of quality, and they have writers and directors who are saying ""What the heck, it's just for kids, don't worry about it being logical.""As an adult viewer, there is much here to make you cringe. Occasionally, the series will throw you a bone, but for the most part, it's a hyperactive little affair.You will see many reviews giving this five stars. You can disregard these. They are, to the one, written by ""Doctor Who"" fans who want to promote anything having to do with their favorite show."
3,book fell out of binding but love the buffyverse,I would give it a 5 star review except for the fact that the dang thing fell apart within minutes of opening it! Too much fuss to exchange it. :(
5,Vampire-zine,Absent the Buffy series this is the closest we can come (along with the Buffy Season 8 comics)
3,Po-mo vampires,"""Tales of the Vampires"" is a collection of short comics about... that's right, wombats! Actually its vampires. But there's a twist and it is that each story takes a different look at the vampire, usually giving them human characteristics such as love, sacrifice, suffering, and humour.I liked the atmospheric ""Dust Bowl"" story for the setting of a remote farmhouse and wandering vampires and the ""Jack"" story set in Victorian London casting a new light on the Jack the Ripper mystery. Fans of Joss Whedon's ""Buffy"" series will enjoy the various stories with Buffy and those characters in them and I recognised a few from when I was a fan of the TV show back in the late 90s.Overall though some are ok with some great art, some are poor, it's not a bad collection but not an essential read or particularly engrossing. Fans of Whedon and vampires in general will enjoy it the most but casual comics fans looking for a good read can safely give this a miss."
1,A frustrating mess for you and your kids . . .,"A rare LOTR toy that is an utter piece of junk. It does not come preassembled, so you must (try to) attach the head and wings. The wings constantly fall out when moved, and the head will not snap into the hole supplied at all. The leg joints are too weak to support the weight of the body, so the thing constantly tips over. And -- although you get a wraith to ride it -- the wraith's legs do not bend, so he falls off. This is a complete waste of your $ that will frustrate you and your child. Don't buy it!"
4,ITS HEAD FELL OFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,When I went to toysrus i saw this toy and thought it looked awesome. So i bought it and got home and i couldnt get the head on so i pushed it in too hard(i guess) and it broke. Then when i put the head in it would fall right off. I thought this was a fell beast not fell head!!!!!!!!! Although my dad did fix it and it works fine and i still play with it off and on.
4,Just be happy Toy-Biz made it.,"I've heard of some who don't like the Fell Beast becuz of the size scale issue. True....The Ringwraith rider is quite out of scale compared to the Fell Beast itself, and that it's not ""in-scale"" with the other LOTR 6"" figs, but to me, just the coolness of the figure just being released, makes up for the slight size imperfection. This is a must for the Die-Hard LOTR Evilness fan. Me myself, I'm quite happy with this aquisition. The Fell Beast's detail is a 5star affair. All in all, it would be nice for the rider to be more in-scale with the beast, but its still cool as hell."
3,The scale is off :-(,"Firstly, the picture on the box (the painting) is quite misleading. The fell beast is too small compared to its rider. Compared to other LOTR 6"" figires, it looks like a baby fell beast.Apart from the scale issue, the detail is magnificent. When the wings are spread, it is quite large. Now imagine if it is true to scale. I was recommended to use the Armies of Middle Earth ring wraith with the Fell BEast. That would be the true scale.It is a good thing that Toy Biz decided to make these. I guess the smaller scale is to cater for pratical shipping purposes.The only thing preventing it from getting 5 stars is the scale."
1,Review of Toy Biz Fell Beast Deluxe Figure,"This would be a really cool toy, except Toy Biz has a manufacturing defect on all of the heads, making this action figure impossible to assemble. (The spring in the head has a defect) This is a real bummer, especially when this is such a rare find. They are aware of the this at Toy Biz, but have not manufactured any new figures or replacement parts!"
3,"Decent, not great","Too many tracks sound like shopping mall elevator muzak to be deemed above average. Both performers have obvious talent, and the Carnatic influences are amusing. However, overall the tunes are too Kenny G. I am new to Subramaniam's work and he seems promising enough to prompt one to look for better recordings than this."
5,You've gotta love it!,"I have been looking for a CD of this piece for 22 years! My cassete tape is about dead. Any fan of Stephane Grapelli will want this CD. Anyone who has not heard the quirky jazz violin of Dr. L Subramaniam is bound to become a fan after hearing this. Trained as a cardiac surgeon, Dr. L. reverted to his true love, jazz violin. If you can get past the ""repetitive"" themes of his pieces and into the ""God knows how many octaves"" uniqueness of his works you will be hooked forever. Grapelli compliments Dr. L. in a way no other violinist could. Together, they make Charlie Daniels look like a seventh-grade music student."
5,great book,The book gives a overview for statistical mechanics in biophysics. It will be an application oriented book for physicists. The way the book is written might be bit daunting for people completely new to physical sciences. It is an important book for biophysicts and can be used to brush up concepts for people who are already into the field
2,Not worth the price of admission,"Don't get me wrong, NFSU2 is a great game but it just doesn't warrent this book. I thought it'd be helpful but it wasn't and I just went through the stages of the game without the book and did just fine. There are plenty of free guides over the internet anyways."
5,Great start!,"I have used COMO SE DICE as a text book to teach Spanish in a military college. COMO SE DICE has concise, clear explanations for every Grammar subject, as well as excellent exercises for the students to practice. Written by two Latin American professors and one Spanish professor, useful expressions and vocabulary are both, from the old ""Motherland"", and the new Hispanic world. I highly recommend it."
4,shaking science at the roots,"I have read husserl's the crisis and enjoyed it very much. I think that this book has lost none of it's relevance. It is a thorough analysis of what science can and cannot do. For me as a landscape architecture teacher this books delivers a good antidote against all too positivistic scientific thinking within the university. It opens our eyes to the fact that science can answer certain questions very well but at a loss of meaning and sense. It peals off the layers of history that hide the shaky foundations of science and reveals the scope of science and that much is beyond this scope. It is meticulous in it's analysis, but in that it is thorough and not shallow. I can advice all who are interested in the relation between science and the world to carefully study this book.The Merleau-Ponty Aesthetics Reader: Philosophy and Painting (SPEP)The World of Perception"
1,very elementary,"I purchased this album when it first came out years ago. I had liked one particular song that I'd heard on the radio and ran out and wasted my money. That song was really the only one worth listening to. And now that I'm older...more mature...I don't care for that song anymore. This was a boring album and the group doesn't show any real lyrical talent. One of the guys in the group had a little talent, but it pretty much ends there...which is why nobody has heard of them and never will."
2,TOO MUCH RELIGION,"Two college couples drive to a remote region to stay at a house Sue Walker inherited from her real family, from which she was separated at nine. One guy in the nearby town had that classic small town ""parents are cousins"" lazy eye. They can only get preaching on the radio, but there is cell phone service, but alas none of them seems to own one. Fornication is sin and the wages of sin is death. The one couple likes to play pass the doobie and hide the sausage. Sue has numerous visions on her way there, the old preacher, and a young girl about 9 years old. Weird things happen at the house as it is clearly haunted. The movie was done well for a low budget but suffered from some really bad plot flaws, like not remembering your sibling with whom you lived with for 9 years."
1,0 STARS: It sucks.,"""Wages of Sin"" is absolutely ridiculous. It tries to make a horror movie out of religious fanatics, but it comes off like a stupid punchline to a bad joke. To be honest, I had trouble finishing this garbage. The plot is ridiculous, the acting is horrible, the characters are wooden/generic and not likable. The script is terrible and the story is ridiculous, and it just does not work on any level whatsoever and is literally impossible to take seriously because the action is so lifeless and uneven. The movie looks like something that a group of middle school children tried to create. Modern day horror is a complete joke, and I've seen enough of this kind of garbage. P.S. What a terrible job paying homage to the Jack Torrance ""Here's Johnny"" scene. Pathetic!! Folks, let's be real here: Wages of Sin sucks."
1,wages of sin,"this is one of the worst films i have seen lately,amazon should have paidme to take it of their hands to burn"
5,Boujour laser thermometer,"I have used the Bonjour thermometer for about a year.The thermometer is quite accurate (~1F). I have tested itin the oven and in the refrigerator. I find it very usefulto measure the temperature of grills, hot frying oils,calphalonpans, heavy cast iron skillets, simmering sauces, woks, and oven stones.Measuring the temperatures of frying oils or getting the cast iron skilletsreally hot (600F) enough for searing steaks are ideal for the laserthermometers. I can now get a steak perfectly seared everytime resultingin a juicy and tender steak. The secret was getting thepan to the right initial temperature. Now the user should be bewarethat the temperature depends on the emissivity of the material, someasuring the surface of shiny pans (ex. my expensive french copper pans ) will yieldthe wrong temperatures. So far I have not yet figured out how tomeasure the temperatures in my favorite Dehillerin copper saute panyet."
3,Inaccurate readings,"I bought a Bonjour Culinary Laser Thermometer directly from Chef's Resource in January 2010. I discovered that the device I got was not very accurate -- off by as much as 10 degrees when measuring boiling water. When I tried to return this product to them, I was told that they don't give refunds on any items that had been used. So now I'm stuck with an expensive, under-performing kitchen tool. My advice: if you insist on buying one of these gadgets, first make sure you can get your money back from the seller -- otherwise you'll be out cost, plus tax and shipping."
2,laser thermometer,I rated it low as it is reading temperatures about 10-12 degrees low.I dont know where to get it fixed.
5,Have to give it 5 Just for being available! Very good,"If you know of the band you will want this piece. The classic line up live in a small club/studio setting. They dont look cool but the music is unique and well executed. The picture and sound are sharp and clear. The camera angles are ""okay"", not real dynamic, but do not detract like many of todays ""quick jump"" productions. It's just so rare to see a group like this at all...gotta be 5 stars."
4,A robust book that covers with breadth and detail,"I had the pleasure of taking Professor Sundaresan's Debt Markets course at Columbia. He has tremendous experience in the marketplace. This book does a good job of covering the theory while also covering the practical aspects of the marketplace. One of my complaints is that some topics lacked a step-by-step approach, and you found yourself looking at a huge equation and wondering where it came from.Hits: Duration, Convexity,Term Structure, Auctions, Treasuries, Corporates, Mortgages.Misses: Futures, Unsightly 3-dimensional graphsI also have Fabozzi's Handbook and Fabozzi's Bond Markets, Analysis and Strategies. This book is comparable to the latter."
2,"Good general information, disappointing textbook","While the book contains a lot of useful general information about Fixed Income securities, as a textbook it was a disappointment.The author assumes that the readers are familiar with some terms and concepts - a definite no for a beginners' textbook which this one attempts to be. I lost a homework grade once because the same parameter was referred to as DV01 throughout the chapter, but called DVBP in the following problems. Sure, for someone in the industry it's a no-brainer, but most people who are trying to solve the problems are not in the industry.I was reluctant to write this review because I heard some praise of the book and its author from several people, but here's something to consider: after nine years in the industry, whenever I had a question related to fixed income securities this book was of no help answering it. Need I say more?"
1,"Poorly written, poorly edited.","Obviously, this book was written based on the author's lecture notes (he is a business school professor). But for those who have not attended his lectures, the book is full of nonsense.The book was not only poorly written by a foreigner whose mother tongue is apparently not English, it was poorly edited. For instance, you can easily find out exactly same descriptions in different chapters, which I have never seen in any book I have ever read. I had an impression that the original manuscript was so terrible that editors gave up their jobs before publishing. No wonder the 3rd edition came out from a different publisher (1st & 2nd from Thomson Learning). I guess the author had to find out a new publisher.The good news to the author is that there are few textbooks out there covering the same topic. I hope somebody will write a good book for students."
2,Paranoid: Black days with Sabbath & other horror stories,"Mr Mick Wall wrote a pretty funny & informative book on the woes of being a junky & a few insightful & funny stories of some major rock stars, but the title of the book is very Decieving! I thought I was purchasing a book about Black Sabbath, not some Ex-Kerrang (Great magazine), writer. If the book was titled ""Adventures of Mick Wall the junky writer"", I would have probably still bought it, but I just felt a little ripped off when only a few pages of the book are dedicated to some Ozzy, Black Sabbath stories. It was an interesting read about the pitfalls of being a junky & trying to make a buck while hooked on smack. I enjoyed that part pretty much, but I wanted to read a Hell of alot more on the great Black Sabbath. Overall, a decent (but short), book about the junky lifestyle. Absolutely Horribly Decieving Title. Not about Black Sabbath."
2,Stay Away,"This is more a review of the writers' own drug use & laziness than a book about Black Sabbath. He uses the popularity of Ozzy & The Osbournes TV show at the time to sell book about himself. No, this book is a terrible diary about a hack magazine writer who steals review copies of LPs to finance a drug habit & sneaks into band parties to drink free booze. My advice? If you want to be like this writer, steal this book, then sell it to a used book store to buy some booze."
4,"Bad title, great book","Its misleading title aside (the publishers simply cited Black Sabbath to try and attract more buyers, it's true), Mick Wall's harrowing memoir strikes terrifyingly close to the music business' true heart of darkness. Sure, the first-hand anecdotes aren't always as satisfying as those found in most rock biogs out there, but they're also a lot more REAL, as anyone who's ever worked in the music industry will attest. So Sabbath and Ozzy fans should by all means look elsewhere for more detailed stories about their heroes, but music fans who dare to step up and peek behind the magic curtain won't find many accounts as courageously candid as this one."
5,A book well worth purchasing.,"I think Paranoid: Black Days with Sabbath and Other Horror Stories is a really fascinating book as it chronicles Mick Wall's experiences in meeting and working alongside the members of Black Sabbath as well as Phil Lynnot of Thin Lizzy, Judas Priest and other rock stars. I mean just read the part where Mick remembers asking Phil as to why he liked to hold his bass guitar so high. Phil's response just cracked me up. So readers if you're a fan of heavy music and especially the above mentioned, go out and buy this book."
3,Biz Dude gone Bad,"If you are expecting tell all revelations about Black Sabbath, along the lines of those about Led Zeppelin in ""Hammer of the God""s, well this just isn't it. Mick Wall wasn't around for most of Sabbath's career, and doesn't remember a great deal from when he was. But don't hold it against him - he tells a good tale of rock decadence (a more truthful title might be ""When Rock Journalists go Bad""), and there's plenty of bits and pieces of behind the scenes gossip. Ozzy even turns up once in a while. Low point: when the author's bodily fluids turn yellow."
2,"Too cute, but not functional.","I bought this seeing that it is very cute. I recieved it in the mail, and while I was taking it out of the package, the rose popped right off the bar. Couldn't even try it on before it needed to be fixed. Although the company is amazing, but this particular product of theirs is not good."
1,Just an overblown IMAQ User Manual,"This book was pretty disappointing - all of the information in it is easily found for free in either the IMAQ user manual, or at the National Insutruments Developer Zone - www.zone.ni.com."
2,"Alas, the book was oversold..",":The general feeling I had after reading the book was that of a disappointment. Overloaded with handbook information on image encoding, compression algorithms etc., the book lacked substance in vision algorithm applications. Expanded IMAQ manual it is, a good book on applications of IMAQ vision algorithms it is not.Espessially disappointing was section on DICOM: whole 4 pages with 2 pages of illustration, promulgating third party software, with not much to offer.The book describes what image analysis algorithms do to image; it does not give hints when we want to use/try what algorithm.It appeared to me the author was more concerned with money making than with writing a decent text.The book can be probably useful for the very beginners, as a substitution for poorly written IMAQ manual. Again, then they should not worry of a minor issue of $70 price tag.."
4,Very Nice Conditioner for Relaxed Black Hair,"Stimulations Super Moisturizing Conditioner is excellent for relaxed Black hair. It leaves my hair feeling soft but I don't use this conditioner exclusively from one relaxer to the next. I think this conditioner is best used for the 2 weeks or so after you get your relaxer touch up. If your scalp was burned a little during the process, this conditioner is really, really, REALLY, very soothing as well as moisturizing. I do find however that it dosen't seem as moisturizing in the last 2 weeks before my relaxer touch up. When my hair is really kinky, then I turn to Nexxus or Keracare for more heavy-duty conditioning. I do however highly recommend this product."
2,completely unusable,"Good book by Crowley, though the method has been tinkered with just enough to render the whole thing unusable. Crowley threw in some inaccuracies into the mix to ensure that those secrets would somehow be protected from the ""profane"". Nice try Al."
5,Wonderful and helpful!,"The Sacred Moment CD, 1 of 4 in the Mental Medicine Collection, helps me to concentrate on finding and experiencing my awareness of the present moment. The author does an amazing job of describing how to reach an awareness of the prestent moment and how to remain there. She gently portrays each moment as being sacred. She also does a wonderful job of explaining how to be calm and free."
4,Good Basic Meditation Tape,"This is a good basic meditation tape that I used everyday for 20 minutes. The background music is very soothing. The verbal instruction are good, albeit with strong accent and I have heard more soothing voices before. The price is a little high."
4,"Heard one, heard 'em all...?","I bought this as a companion to the other Mental Medicine cd I have, ""Quiet Thoughts: Guided Meditation for Stress Reduction."" While both are good and get the job done, I was disappointed to find that they are very similar. I was hoping for more of a difference between the two, but found that the core relaxation elements are the same. There are some differences, but not enough to justify my purchasing any more in the series. I think one or two are enough to satisfy most needs."
5,Celia Cruz with the Alegre All Stars!!!,"This 1968 nrelease is one of Celia's most unfairly underrated albums. Released on Tico Records, it's noteworthy because it was the ONLY album on which Celia Cruz was accompanied by the legendary Alegre All Stars. If you've never heard this album before, you really need to get it as its filled with the ultra-hot, in-your-face, no-holds-barred HARD Salsa grooves which the Alegre All-Stars were known for coupled with Celia's inspired improvisations. Charlie Palmieri, Jose ""Chombo"" Silva, Kako and many other members of this legendary band played on this album and it's sad (and shameful) that this album is not better-known."
2,what are you getting?,"I have been looking for a book about this individual for quite some time. I do think the historical facts, drawings pictures etc are a interesting collection. The writing is horrible. The authors take off on flights of discriptive prose I find completely useless to the purpose of the book. It is poorly edited, and the punctuation is sloppy at best. I am not sure it is worth the $35 price tag."
1,no feedback from seller,"I made than order from this website, but never received comfirmation, even when I sent an email to the seller, nor did I ever receive the book I ordered. I would not do business with this seller again. I had to order another book at the last minute and pay more money."
3,Back to the drawing board,"LIKE:Size/weight is the ideal balance between portability and usability. Abundance of useful tools without silly contraptions (no fish scalers or parcel hooks taking space here). The contour grip and locking blade are a definite plus if you value your fingers.DISLIKE:One shouldn't have to extend scissors and pliers to deploy the screwdriver (and close them to use it; and open and close them again to retire the screwdriver). The screwdriver tangs are also too small and sunk too deep, you may have to resort to the toothpick to grab them. The blade nick is obstructed by the pliers' head. These are annoyances that could have been avoided with minor design tweaks.SUMMARY:The quality and craftmanship is there. The layout, however, needs some rethinking."
4,Big Swiss Army Knife!,"I have had some SAK's but always wanted a big one. I think first in Hercules model, but seems it has less uses than this one. This is obviuosly not a pocket-carry knife, unless you use cargo pants! It needs a pouch to carry on belt and wold be very desirable that sellers offer a package that includes it. It is strong and good for tough jobs, locking blade is a plus! I think that it is a good hunter/fisher companion. Regarding envelope, box is stiff and not like other models, maybe they are thinking in economy when designed that enveloping box. Knife is superb like all made by Victorinox. Highly recommended!"
2,Bulky - Heavy - Clumsy,"This is a pocket knife that doesn't fit in a pocket, with implements that get in each others way and a blade that's illegal carry in most civilized societies. Why did they even bother giving it an ergonomic profile, I wonder, when the bulging tools makes it impossible to wrap your fingers around the handles?Fact is, in this price/weight category the folding knife form factor has been rendered obsolete by the pliers-based design, and the Workchamp stands as a relic of a bygone era. Those looking for a beefy tool should consider the Victorinox Spirit instead: it weighs and costs about the same in a slimmer, stronger, more versatile package. And it comes with full size pliers (the pliers on the Workchamp are cute but useless).I regret this purchase, the only use I found for it is as a desk curio."
4,"Has Everything, But VERY BIG - Recommended","I bought this knife as a gift for my son, and am rethinking giving it to him. He wanted a multi-tool knife and I wanted it to have a locking blade (he might need his fingers sometime in the future :-). This knife has all of the tools he could ever want and then some. Most interesting are the locking knife blade (VERY BIG), practical scissor, functional pliers, and the large saw blade.Pros:+ Has a lot of useful tools!+ Locking blade comes razor sharp+ Very well made+ SturdyCons:- This is a HUGE knife - it is not a pocket knife!- Does not come with a belt case (sold separately) :-(This is a very useful knife!Recommended!CFH"
5,Subaru Resonator Assembly,"I was told I needed to replace the resonator pipe and muffler on my 1998 Subaru Legacy Outback due to small leaks or fail state inspection. I found this part here and it was loads cheaper than what it would cost for the garage to replace it. Ordered it and the gaskets for each end (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AX9SRC/ and http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AX82VK/) and all 3 pieces were correct and fit perfectly. Saved a small fortune buying the parts myself, and they can be changed by yourself as well if you've got a little mechanical expertise, basic car tools, and a way to get underneath the car (I used ramps). I will definitely consider Walker replacement parts in the future, as all of the parts fit (as Amazon and the Walker site said). The one gasket has a new part number (31697 instead of 31358) as can be seen if you look at the diagram for my car on the Walker web site... but believe me, the 31358 part is the right part."
5,"Hachiko, a delicately woven tale","THe true story of Hachiko is beautifully crafted in Pamela Turner's retelling. The little boy Kentaro, and his friendship with Hachiko a loyal dog, resonate with character, without being sentimental. Turner's poetic writing is complemented perfectly by Yan Nascimbene's deceptively simple illustrations, it has a timeless quality.My little boy (4) absolutely adores this gentle story, it will be a favourite with both of us for many years to come. I highly recommend it for children of any age."
5,A heartwarming tale for all ages,"When my 14-year old daughter heard the story of Hachiko, her voice caught in her throat as she cried out, ""Oh!"" and hid her tears. This poignant story of man's best friend is beautifully told by Pamela Turner. It will warm the hearts of readers of all ages."
2,not as good as i hoped,this book really let me down. I had hoped to read a heart warming book but instead i got like half a book. It was a dissappointment how short and jumpy it was. It seemed like it lacked many details that i felt nesscesary. I wouldnt reccomend this book.
5,Hachiko,"I bought a copy of this book for my veterinarian's office following the death of my dog. It's a perfect selection -- short enough to read in the waiting room, and the subject is a loyal dog. They appreciated it.Arrived quickly and in good condition."
3,Not what I expected.,I expect more pictures but mostly it's text. Probably my mistake for not researching on this book before ordering.But it would be perfect for kids who loves to read a story.
1,Lee's book was not very fulfilling,"Have the velvety hardcovered copy that i found in near mint condition online this year....the price was less than $30.00. Unfortunately, this book is NOT a classic Elsie Lee novel and the ending was completely mystifying because there had been no real character development (as there is all of her books) to explain the heroine's actions. Nabob's Widow, Diplomatic Lover, Roommates and Star of Danger are all better books than this one. I am an avid Elsie Lee fan and have and love all of her books (even have her very well written cookbooks), but this book made it seem like she was being paid by the word instead of for the book's content."
1,"boring and stupid, don't waste your money!!!","I bought this book almost 3 months ago and still haven't finished reading it. Normally I consume these books, but this one just doesn't peak my interest. Both Max and Angel are boring and really don't have personality. The rules of this magical world are odd, and really don't make any sense. A watch keeps his safe in the sun? It's just silly and boring. Adding a wereworlf into the mix was downright stupid. There wasn't anything original about this story, don't waste your time or your money."
4,good guitar for price,"guitar was bought for someone.............very good for beginner and intermediate, also very good action on the guitar for the price"
4,WAX on WAX off,Using it on my RV it worked just as good as the three part products by Meguiar's and cost a lot less at Amazon. It is easy and fast especially with an orbital applicator but works by hand also. Made our 10 year old RV look new again.
4,A bizarre yet familiar portrayal of suburban life,"Antrim takes a small suburban community and removes the authorities which force it to be civilized. The result is a bizarre mixture of barbarism, fad culture and civilized neighbourly rivalry. I found it fascinating, entertaining and darkly funny.What made it funny was that, despite the extremity to which the aspects of suburban living had been taken, it was all very familiar. The satire is sharp, but Antrim manages to express it as an insider telling a shared joke, rather than as an outsider taking pot-shots at another's culture.I enjoyed this book immensely. Antrim's second novel, The Hundred Brothers, is also very good, but I think I liked Elect Mr. Robinson for a Better World more."
2,Relentlessly Bleak.,"Such unpleasantness! And to what end?The same old, ""Yea, the deepest ring of Hell is Suburbia"" nihilism; (the pet musing of all college freshmen away from home for the first time).And that over-the-top, gross-out violence -- written in the pat ironic tone, of the guy who's SEEN IT ALL, and you have NO IDEA of the depths of human depravity...Well I'm a little maxed out on this theme, and the nastiness at the end seems pointless, grotesque, and redundant.Still, it had some nice bits, and I like the start of the '100 brothers', so I'll try that; but overall I'd say: this particular 90's trend/theme must be almost used up, right?"
4,pads,These work great for bladder protection. They are light weight & comfortable to wear daily. Price is good also for the product.
4,Good down-to-earth writing with indepth explanations.,"Though I haven't finished the book, I am particularly impressed with the down-to-earth writing style of the author. I especially appreciate that he explains the roles the different tools you will be using have in the creative process. I also like the variety of texture creation he explores. He gives the reader the knowledge to create a wide range of texture maps."
2,Poorly written and edited,"I bought this book hoping to learn more about the specifics of making 3D textures. Instead, I was confused and misled. There are glaring errors in this book that, if you didn't know any better, would lead you astray. Take the chapter one tutorial on layers--the file that comes on the cd-rom is the wrong one. There is a replacement on Coriolis' web site, but this too does not match with the book at all. Sort of misses the point--and now I can't return the book! The author writes in a train-of-thought style that is difficult to follow, and his examples are often poorly documented in b&w, when color would have been a better choice (despite what Coriolis says, this book is *not* entirely in full color). There is probably alot of useful info in this book, but because I had to wade through so much poor writing/editing, it was hard to extract. I learned a few unique tips, but not $40+ worth."
5,Great!,It was just what my husband needed to fix a truck. It arrived before it was expected. It was cheaper than anywhere I looked.
1,cheap,"1st of all the timer doesn't work properly, it ticks down like it is supposed to but it doesn't ""ding"" when finished.also the fur easily pulls our, like as if it is not completely stitched it right."
5,A Very Very Talented Sista,"Have had this CD for over 10 years and can't stop listening to it. I listen to very little gangsta rap(54 y/o) but this is true talent. ""Ghetto Tears"" needs to be re-released for the power that it has. I've bumped ""Go Down On It"" at many times to a rave revue. Much Luv 4 Sh'Killa!!!"
3,"Rhetoric, a simplified version","The publication A Rhetoric of Argument: Brief, is brief, panders to repetition and does not clarify the more difficult assessment on the kinds of fallacies that occur, while at the same time, uses jargon and sentence structure that no college student would use in everyday speech, or even in other papers.I am disappointed."
5,Essence of the Dominican Republic,This video really is the essence of the Dominican Republic. It shows from a Dominican viewpoint life in New York. Balbuena (the main character)is hilarious. A very heartwarming story of the struggle immigrants face in the United States. Also see the 1st movie Nueba Yol 1. It is excellent as well.
3,Not good for fine hair animals.,"My parents always used this for our dogs growing up and still do with their large mix, and it works great. So, I ordered one for my black lab/aussie shephard mix whose hair has been all over the house! His hair is really thin and fine compared to any other dog I have ever had and compared to my parents lab mix. This brush doesn't seem to grab it at all... So I don't think it is meant for fine hair.If you have a dog with thick or rough textured hair, it would be a good buy. For me, not so much."
4,Does As Advertised,"DVD is great for different options for countdowns, many to choose from. But as another reviewer noted the Audio is annoying. I tend to have to use it on mute and sometime miss when time is up. I wish they had tracks that did not have the ticking sound."
4,Fun and Durable with One Small Hitch,"We bought this last Christmas for our then 18-month-old grandson. He loves it and plays with it a lot, even after 6 months. It is one of his favorite toys. He is usually rather hard on toys because he likes to keep his throwing arm in shape, if you know what I mean. ;) This toy is no worse for the wear and has held up amazingly well. It is not a battery hog either. My one and only complaint is the same one that a previous reviewer mentioned. The cover for the CD player is very difficult to open. In fact, my grandson cannot open it. We must open it for him. And then once you open it, the cover tends to come completely off. If you could just leave the cover off it would be less of a nuisance, but the CDs won't play without the cover on. If not for this one flaw, I would definitely have rated it 5 stars. But even with that flaw, I would recommend this toy."
2,BAD DESIGN,"THE TOY IS CUTE BUT THE DESIGN TO OPEN THE COVER TO PUT THE DISC IN IS THE WORSE EVER, ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO OPEN, LET ALONE A 2 Y OLD BOY"
5,"Benny Hill Complete and Unadulterated-The Naughty Early Years, Set One (1969-1971)",A couple of hours of laughter..
5,British brilliance,"But he transcends the Euro-feel. He is truly the master of laughter. And I mean gut-wrenching laughter. I first saw Benny (Alfie) Hill in the early eighties syndicated in the U.S.I often wondered why he was'nt as popular as Monty Python in the states. It's because the shows were edited to 1/2 hours...stripping nearly 1/2 the content.As I watch the shows now, as they were meant, a clear narrative comes through. Take the amazing ""European Song Contest"" where he plays about 10 characters. Or the hilarious ""Wrestler"" sequence.Yes, there are some anomolies as previously stated but they are of very short duration...certainly bearable."
3,Benny showing his age,"It's nice to know that you can own the whole Benny Hill canon but the early years are not the best ones.True, there are some truly hilarious sketches but I far prefer the Hill's Angels years, perhaps because I remember those the first time around.The format of these early shows invariably included a long forgotten variety act of no humorous content so you'll be fast forwarding a lot.My advice is, buy the sets in reverse order starting with the mid-eighties stuff then stop when you've had enough.Don't buy the ""best of"" sets as you'll be sorely disappointed."
3,Not what was expected,Overall I love Benny Hill but the discs didn't contain a specific skit that the web said it did. This was read elsewhere so not the seller's fault
2,Not that great!!!,"First of all I dont understand how ppl can give 5 stars so easily!! It really leaves you wonder!! Songs I like ""Two masters, Long hard fight, Sudden Death , Come Jesus Come"". Its still the only record they made in the 80's that I would recommend!! After this record Servant went down musically speaking!!!"
2,Servant stumbles in their world of sand,"Three songs (""Wall of Love"" ""Two Masters"" and ""Cheap Talk"") are the highlights of this unfocused album. Personal tragedy greatly impacted the community were the band members lived and it's detailed in ""Sudden Death"" and overshadows other songs on the LP. The overly long, one-joke ""Jungle Music"" was written in defense of Jesus Music and its rock and roll ways, but one listen was enough and we lose 6 minutes to this ""joke.""A 45 was included which had an instrumental on one side and ""Cog in the Wheel"" on the other, a song about the loss of humanity. Problem is, neither track is very compelling and one wonders why they weren't included on the album proper?At any rate, next to their final album, SWIMMING IN A HUMAN OCEAN, this is the band's least focused project which is understandable due to the circumstances surrounding its recording."
2,an old wine in a new glass,"the topic looks new .in fact it is not. dr.fassi,s language is not readable.it is also vague.one must ask himselve: to whom I,m writting and why ? finaly: the book is not knowen among experts and nobody has mentioned it"
2,"Dr Clark may be hard to read, but its not fundamentalist","I just read the critcisms of this book. I do not agree that the author is a fundamentalisit. Ok, I don't know why she did use Jerry Mattatics. But I did find some real good things in what Dr Clark had to say. I disaggree with anybody who says she should not push Seton curiculum. Why not. She's not the founder of Seton. Ann Caroll is. But she runs and controls it now. Dr Clark is right for not doing ANYTHING with any American bishops. Most are liberals and push sex ed for kids. Ok, this book is very hard to read at times. But it is traditonal and that is what we need."
1,Disappointed Catholic reader...,"but according to Mary Kay Clark I must not be a true Catholic if I don't spank my kids into submisson and run my home like a dictatorship.I plan on educating my son in the Catholic ways and hopefully reviving some of the lost parts of our beautiful religion, but I do not need to hit him or smack him ever. He obeys me without physical violence. And the part of the book that says it is a form of perversion to co-educate girls and boys in the same classroom. What if you homeschool and have a girl and boy. Should they always stay in separate areas of the house. Her expectations are ridiculous in my opinion. The only part of the book I found somewhat applicable was the snippet on telling your in-laws and grandparents you are homeschooling and the chapter on socialization.Her ways are far too strict and her writng was confusing at times. She may have good intentions but she is too extreme for our household."
3,Are some of these messages below truly reviews?,I hope all who come here can pick there way through the bashing of MKC and Seton and figure out what was liked or disliked the book. I am embarassed.
2,some helpful tips,We are not home-schoolers. Our three kids all go to our parish school. The religion is not that good. So we are looking at lots of books for help. THis one gave us some helpful tips for teaching religion at home. Other things seem good too.
1,a bootcamp approach to catholic homeschooling,"This book describes a ""bootcamp approach"" to Catholic home-schooling. For Clark, ""It's MY way or the highway. Nobody is TRULY Catholic but us."" Well, I'm sorry, but that isn't true. For one thing, Dr. Clark is NOT the pioneer that she claims to be (as a reviewer points out below, Mrs Anne Warren Carroll is the TRUE pioneer, who Clark has co-opted). For another thing, the materials she charges struggling home-schooling families so much to use are of such a poor quality; they are often tattered photocopies that have been endlessly recycled. Finally, the rigid approach to homework rushes, overwhelms and then exhausts the kids, even though they're top-students over all. So now, at the end of one more boring and frustrating semester, WE QUIT! So, go ahead and get this book, but read it carefully, and be sure to supplement it with other more balanced materials (Berquist, Hahn & Hasson, or whatever you can find)."
1,"No true traditionalist, Clark commends non-Catholic sources","I'm sick and tired of all this talk about the ""traditional"" approach of ""Dr"" Mary Kay Clark (or ""Ms"" as the ""truley"" [sic] Catholic reviewer from Japan calls her!). First, if you read her book closely, you'll see that she recommends plenty of non-Catholic materials. Second, she never talks about the authentic traditional Mass and its importance for Catholic families. A very clever imposter, she makes her competitors look liberal, when she is no different..."
1,Don't Bother,"Don't waste your money on this item. Not even worth the effort. Suction cup doesn't stick to the windshield very good. The whole design is flimsy...the saying holds true, you get what you pay for, and this item is really cheap...in price and design."
1,cheap material not working properly - don't waste your money,"I decided to order this clipboard despite few not very good reviews available. The clipboard does not stay stuck to the windshield for a longer time. I keep finding it off again and again. The holding part of the paper is made very cheaply, the pen keeps falling out of the holder all the time, and there are just very few paper sheets.This item belongs to the Dollar Stores, not being sold for more than one dollar. This was a total waste of money."
1,Flimsy,A flimsy product. The spring which holds the notes is weak so the paper-block falls out regularly. The string which held the pen just poped out from its place.I'd have sent it back to Amazon but got rid of the box and instead gave the entire holder to my grandson to play with...
1,Bosch Battery Burned UP!!!,"I purchased 3 new batteries for my 4 year old Bosch 18V kit. It was a hard decision because the batteries are so expensive and only lasted for 4 years before total death. The tools were still good so I pulled the trigger on new batteries. Now, less than a year into the new batteries and I come home to a smokey shop and a hot melted pile where my battery was charging. I thought the NiCads where the robust chemistry!!The Bosch service center where I bought them closed, the online tool wont except my part numbers, and I tried to call BoschTools service 4 times. Twice they have said they'll send me an RMA shipper, but nothing ever comes!! Horrible service.Do yourself a favor and stay away from Bosch. Overpriced, low reliability, and horrible service."
1,Great Product but AMAZON is WAY overpriced on this,"Hi,I regret I purchased this last week from Amazon. It is available for 20% less from other online retailers. I am surprised because Amazon is usually competitively priced."
2,Poor capacity,"I have a complete set of Bosch 18v tools that have seen very little use due to poor battery performance. The original set (non BlueCore) lasted for only a few cycles before failing. One melted the plug end, the other quit taking a charge. I replaced them with a pair of the newer BlueCore. These did slightly better with good capacity but again had very short lifespan, providing perhaps half dozen cycles. I was about to dump the whole tool system but decided to try one more set of batteries. This latest pair from Amazon have very limited capacity, far less than my old 9.6v Makita, but are working and hopefully after a few cycles the capacity will improve."
5,Great!!,"Item arrive quick ,and works great,reasonable price ,not knock off will, highgly recomendable.Work perfect in my 5 years old kit and add a kick i didint felt in some time."
5,bosch at 181,"I really liked doing business with B &B Lumber, they had the battery sent within a few days. So far its working great. Thank You Rod"
1,short on power,"The battery works, but for a short time only, and it does not hold a charge very well...kind of dissapointed in it..."
1,I'll Never Buy Bosch Cordless Again!,"I bought the cordless jigsaw less than two years ago and hardly EVER used it. I followed the charging and draining instructions to the letter, and now after six or seven months of storage, the battery is dead. I always drained the battery after use, never left it in the charger, and never overheated it. I'll bet I don't have more than 60 minutes of total run time on this battery! I am very disseminated in the performance of their ni-cad junk. I do, however, like the jig saw and will buy a corded model. I have a DeWalt combo pack that I have been very happy with and will continue to buy DeWalt Cordless. If you only need a cordless Bosch for a short time and then plan to sell it, it will work. Otherwise, stay away from Bosch Cordless products."
3,Not what I expected,"I bought 2 batteries to replace my 2 old batteries expecting that the charge would last longer being that they were ""BlueCore"" and ran cooler. Nope! Same if not less then my 4-5yr old ""Stock"" batteries! Maybe Lithium-Ion is the way to go.?? But have heard of some of them exploding in the charger."
4,New replacement for my power tools :),"I 1st thought I had purchased the wrong product , but come to my satisfaction and speaking with different people , I had the correct product. I don't know what I would do without my battery operated power tools. Thanks amazon for making my purchase simple and pain free, even after I thought I had the wrong item, csr's were very helpful to see that I was happy with my purchase.:)"
5,Makes Chewie Look Like a Young Pup.,"Tarfful is a Wookie warrior who plays a crucial and pivotal role in REVENGE OF THE SITH (among other things saving Yoda's life). Now that everyone can see the Wookie battle that's been over 20 years in the making, it's only right that people can have the action figures to go along with the different Wookies, too. Everyone always seemed to be impressed with Chewbacca and his size and fright factor. However, just by looking at the action figure, Tarfful makes Chewie look like a young pup. Tarfful at least appears to be much larger than Chewbacca. His fur is also a mixture of gold, brown, and white. And he's got dreadlocks. Tarfful comes with a Wookie bowcaster that actually shoots a ""projectile."" Just don't shoot it too far otherwise you might loose it. An impressive addition to any STAR WARS collection."
4,Good indie film,"While I understand the necessity of a bikini-clad woman on the cover art, it misrepresents what this film is really all about, and it's a good movie. Not great, but good."
5,See it!,"Funny, warm hearted comedy. Excellent cast. See it! (And don't be put off by the misguided cover art)"
5,Funny and Heartwarming!,"Fantastic movie, it manages to keep it humerous while going through all the different aspects of a great film! Good job Ishai and Ian! And good job to all the cast and crew! truely spectacular!"
5,My first buy in Amazon,"A friend of mine sent me a link to watch a Ken Robinson's performance in TED conference on how creativity is being killed in schools.On feeling my interest on the issue raising -since I am studying education myself- there i was few minutes later looking for a Robinson's paper to read. ""Out of our minds"" was my choice and Amazon.com the mean of get it.It has an efficient service which brought my buy right on time, as they promised. Now i am (bookwormly) reading."
2,Wordy,Didn't like it. I could hardly get through the first chapter. It's not nearly as accessible as 'The Element'. (Which is an amazing must-read of Robinson's work.) I'm looking forward to reading the more reader friendly 2010 version with updated information.
3,Big brain underutilized,"This book is excellent reading, it is after completion that disappointment arrives. I enjoyed this, my first, Dun novel so much that I ordered his other books. However, in thinking about Overfall I came to realize that Sam was out-thought and out-planned, until the very end, by adversarys without access to the ""big brain"" computer. It seems more luck than anything that he was semi-triumphant. Certainly, he must have recruiting problems as his best skilled team members and friends fall in record numbers. Perhaps there should be greater reliance on ""big brain"" as the hero of the novel.I am looking forward to reading the books I have ordered and will read the next ""Sam of something"" novel. ""Sam"" is a great creation and has potential to become a rival of Cussler's ""Dirk""."
4,A lovely love story,"Marilyn Pappano is back with her unusually deep, interesting characters and her delightful small town of Bethlehem, NY. Both Melina and Sebastian were totally sympathetic characters, both trying to tackle the same problem, their hot affair, from completely different angles. She is falling in love and trying to understand, he is running from heartbreak. Both characters felt so real I could touch them.The kids, including recurring character Lanie from the second Bethlehem book, are on a desperate search for the people who have abandoned them. It is heartbreaking to see the pain of a mother's rejection, even from kids who do have others in their lives who love them. All in all, this is a story about love, the agony, the ecstasy, and the comfort of having someone who loves you."
1,What is the Palin Himalaya link?,As the other reviewers have said although Amazon is packaging this item like it is the Palin version it is not. Alas they suckered me in too.......
1,Duped,Amazon should know better than to advertise a silly animated cartoon along with videos by a major star who made a video series of the same name. Shame on you guys! Perhaps this is the only way (even if it is underhanded) that Amazon can sell this piece of garbage fluff.
2,Ink runs out fast,"This printer uses all ink colors even if you don't print! Every so often it primes the ink through all the cartridges. So yes, your friend can be using everything even if she never prints black.Worse yet, as previously mentioned, as soon as ANY ink color goes low it will stop printing all together. Forget trying to get out those last few copies - it shuts down and refuses to even try even if ink is sloshing around in the low cartridge. If magenta is low, it won't even print out a standard black text.The separate colors were a good idea, but it uses all the ink so fast that you are constantly buying all the new cartridges anyway."
3,is color ink used when printing black?!?!?,"Is it true that using a Brother MFC-5440CN printer to ONLY print black text emails and word processing documents will also consume the three color ink tanks?It seems to be true because that is the case with a friend's printer: she never printed color and all three color tanks have run dry and, unless the 3 color tanks were replaced, the printer refused to continue printing in simple black."
2,"If You're Looking for Real Info, Keep Looking","the part i missed in looking at this book before buying it was ""366 ... REFLECTIONS ... "" that's what it is -- the author's old-school thoughts on ""parenting,"" randomly assembled in this book. the fact that his ideas are old-fashioned is not the real problem with this. it's just that these random *thoughts* (that go from a baby-related one to a teen-related one to a toddler one to a pre-teen one) don't do much to help me with my toddler now. ""insightful"" and ""thought-provoking,"" perHAPS, but what i need is advice/tips/helps. not someone's random and hard-core THOUGHTS."
1,Read Mr. Rosemond's book with discernment,Thinly veiled fundamentalism. Many of his ideas and musing are right on but under what appears to be expertise is harsh old testament fundamentalism. I don't want to throw the baby out with the bath water here but please read with care.
2,Some good advice but too much annoying stuff.,Common-sense parenting? I guess so... if your idea of common-sense parenting is an 'I'm-the-boss and you'd-better-obey-without-question' attitude.
2,'Because I Said So!' : 366 Insightful and Thought-Provoking,"I think Rosemond is quite full of himself as he presents himself as the *only* parenting expert that knows the truth about parenting. I have tried to read this book with an open mind, but I can't get over the fact that he advocates spanking! What he says is not all bad, but why should the reader have to weed out so much to get so little?"
1,"Yeah, I read his book.","Clearly, he's just telling people what they want to hear. Wake up and smell the coffee, and realize all he cares about is selling books and making money. He doesn't really care how children turn out, or he wouldn't endorse a barbaric practice like spanking. Oh, well. I guess everybody can't be perfect."
5,Heads up! Here comes Barry Crimmins.,"Crimmins' book is not only great political satire, it is an honest and insightful personal account of someone raised in small town America. He is a sports fan, a comedian, a son, an entrepreneur whose essays are hilariously irreverent blistering salvos from the heart of someone who cares deeply and walks the talk."
2,Sick but Stylish,"Just let me begin by saying that this is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long, long time.However!It is not the worst HORROR movie I've ever seen. It's a scary movie, true. And the effects and design of the film are breathtaking.But this is an awful, awful movie. The plot is rediculous and frequently predictable. There are parts of the movie that I found absolutely sickening, and I have a strong stomach for gore. The ending is terrible, and also predictable.It's a mean-spirited, badly acted, predictable, poorly written, disgusting piece of garbage movie.But it is a scary horror movie.Hope I hammered my points home. Avoid this piece of dreck."
3,Silent Hill,Kind of difficult to follow. Have to watch it more than one time to understand. An okay movie.
2,No matter how good the special effects you still need a script.,"The visual creativity of this movie is terrific. There are scenes that are almost inspired in their eery feel and imaginitive creepiness. But you can't make a movie with just this. You need a story and this movie just doesn't have one. Compare this movie to the Alien Movies where the special effects were also inspired and something to talk about but the special effects were the supporting cast to a great story. In this movie the special effects are the main star and it just doesn't make for a good movie. A good video game yes, but movie no."
2,Silent Hill the movie,"I went to see this movie because it was the only ""scary movie"" showing at the time. I'm really into video games, however, I've never played any of the Silent Hill fourpiece. I found that this movie left me unentertained, confused, and overall angry at the usher. Granted that Silent Hill is chock full of suspense, I was never even close to the edge of my seat. I would've rather paid $8.50 to see Iron Eagle IV instead of this attempt at a film. Whomever produced/directed this movie should stick to video games or be shot in the kneecaps. It has some okay special effects, and the plot alone had potential to be a video game-movie that for once didn't suck. But it didn't. If you are thinking about seeing Silent Hill with your boyfriend or girlfriend, just send me a money order for the cost of the tickets, and I'll travel to your home and slap both of you in the face. At least this way will be less humiliating."
4,You have to love the game..before the movie !,"Well for starters, you have to love the game first before you even like this movie and before you even begin to watch it to understand it all. If you haven't, more than likely, you will not like this movie. I have yet, not met one person who hasn't played the Playstaion game yet and not like the movie. To me, this is one of the best Playstation games turn to movies by far, it has played right down to the music and the darkness of the game it self all the way to its disturbing creepiness.The only down side is that yes, the movie is a tad too dark and sometimes makes it hard to see the ""monsters"" and what not, however, thats how the game is played and wasn't really that big of a deal for me. But, the story was decent, the acting was so-so and not a lot of gore within the movie as you would see in the game, but, still not a huge deal. Anyways, if you are a fan of the game, you will truly like the movie. Recommended !"
5,Best horror game to movie adaptation,Very faithful to the series even goes as far as using the music from the game by the same music producer. Original characters made for the movie that are similar to the characters in the game without having to be repetitive. Good plot overall and very terrifying moments where you can sympathize with the main characters and also has an ending that will leave you with an empty feeling in your stomach.Silent Hill the movie rocks and is til this day one of my fav horror movies.
1,corney,"This was garbage a real waste of time, nothing shocking and thrilling about this movie just plain boring. The creature effect sucked the acting was dumb i mean why would you put one person doing the exploreing and there was not much killing, so this was a corney movie."
2,Ending is a let down.,"The first 3/4's of the film I thought was good, gothic horror. Unfortunately, the ending was too ""blockblusterish and really did not fit the atmosphere of the early part of the film and was a big let down. The ending kept this movie from being a classic."
2,An utter waste of time!,"I have to agree with the other opinions given by amazon customers.This movie was not worth taking the time and watching. The script was far from good from the very beginning. For one, I think that if I had a child having dreams about this ""mysterious"" place called Silent Hill and was sleep-walking to the edges of cliffs, that I'd take her for a ride to the local psychiatrist and have her take a look at things.The special effects were okay. I thought the image of the burnt girl was a little unrealistic considering that people don't turn BLACK when they burn, but they were the best part of the movie.I absolutely HATED the ending to it. I have to say it; the movie started out bad and ended up worse."
1,Awful Awful Awful Awful Awful Awful Awful,"I wish that I could have given this movie less than 1 star, but the system wouldn't let me. This has to be the worst, plotless movie that I have EVER seen. I kept watching it, because I thought that it had to get better, but it kept getting worse. Let me repeat, there is NO plot whatsoever. I can't believe that a mainstream movie company actually greenlighted this script. Do NOT waste your money!!!p.s. Like 10 minutes of this mess of a movie would not have been enough, it is WAY too long, and lasts about 2 hours (which feels like 7 hours)."
3,?,"First with regard to Blu-Ray, I suspect the above reviewer was using an inferior television. The picture was sharp and superb almost to the point of distraction sometimes, but I suppose that's the point of using Blu-Ray."
5,One of the better videogame-to-movie translations,"Try not to keep disasters like Doom in your mind when thinking of games getting made into movies. Even Final Fantasy: Spirits Within wasn't terrible when you consider that the makers of the movie were likely pushed to design the movie to be accessible and relatable to a wider audience. While it captured the same emotion of the games, it didn't really hit that spot of reproducing the same feelings the game elicitsSilent Hill does. It may not have been as wickedly scary as the games, however in a much shorter span of time, they managed to hit that sweet spot and capture exactly what made the games fantastic...cool music, freaky scares, a deeply intriguing backstory of the town's inherent supernatural problems, etc.Really great movie here that both makes the games' canon more interesting, and is made more interesting by the games. Well done."
5,Silent hill movie,"great movie, it is worth watching and not bad of a price that i paid. and it came with great packaging."
5,Good movie,"I loved this movie the first time I saw it. And this is a great purchase of youre a silent hill fan get over the inaccuracies and just enjoy it for what it is. Silent hill is the best, Konami I love you keep it up, and downpour wasn't so bad."
4,Exceeded my expectations,"My significant other insisted I watch this movie; I would've passed on it otherwise. I'm glad I did -- it was very well done, and appropriately creepy, disturbing etc.It's undeniable in its eye-candy appeal. My only criticism is that it could have been shorter, but then again, that would have detracted from the deliberately ""videogame"" feel of the whole thing.I never thought I'd be writing a positive review of a film based on a game, but there you go. Special treat: Those oddly sensual but still horrific dancing nurses! Man, what an image!"
4,Good rendition of the game to movie!,"This movie has grown on me over the years and has become one of my favorites in the realm of suspense and horror. The Blu-Ray edition helped take it to a new level with a much better improved sharpness and depth, though not as consistent as other Blu-Rays. It has some moments when it doesn't have that 'wow-factor' that other Blu-Rays have, but again for this type of movie and the atmosphere it is great. I am glad I purchased it on Blu-Ray."
2,Silent Hell,"It's hard for me to explain my thoughts on this movie. I have never been so divided by opinions. On the one hand the movie has the darkest most ghoulish touch I've ever seen. It's as if man's mind was split open and evil were permitted to drip across the screen. The visuals are too striking to do them justice with mere words.On the other hand, the plot and acting were so poorly thrown together you'd think it was a dress rehearsal and they were making it up as they went.The soundtrack is a bonus as it encompasses a lot of what makes the series shine. Sadly, it is used around THIS cast of characters who aren't fit to be in Silent Hill to begin with.My advice; if you are a Silent Hill fan, it's a must see for the sheer backdrops of creation. If you aren't a fan, this movie will likely make sure you never become one."
1,In a word...AWFUL,"I won't go into detail but I just had to write that this is one of the worst movies I have ever had the misfortune to sit through. Everything about it is bad. The acting, script, directing, just plain awful. Steer clear!!!"
1,Terrible movie,"I like horror movie and this sucked.Bad story, bad acting, bad everything.It was such a waste of time to watch."
2,Silent snore,"Just couldn't really get into this movie. It was slow and I found myself pretty bored. The effects were not very impressive and they seemed to want to just rely on the effects and gore more than the lame story. Lots of gross out moments, few actual scares."
2,"Eerie & atmospheric, but too little action","(2 & 1/2 stars) In the past I've enjoyed some of the movies made from video games - the 1st Resident Evil flick comes to mind - but this Silent Hill was just a little too lifeless for me. The LOOK of the picture is intriguing, with some relatively strong horror effects. However, there are too many scenes of people just walking around, not really doing anything. To put it another way, when the lead character sees the monsters, she usually just screams and runs away. She rarely does anything to combat them. And there were too many things in the plot that made no sense. The Silent Hill movie just never really grabbed me."
2,Plot....what plot?!?,"Disjointed, seemingly never-ending flow of images that make no sense and get boring about half-way. Need I say more."
4,Spooky,"It may be because this videogame absolutely scared me as a child, but this was one of the scarier movies I have ever seen."
2,Awesome movie!,I got this movie used thinking 'hey' I've bought used stuff before it will work fine! But no it skips and I gave it to someone as a gift. I've really learned my lesson.
4,Awesome film despite a few boring parts,"Although this movie had a few boring parts that slowed it down, ill watch this movie over the entire Resident Evil series any day of the week. with the exception of the RE cgi movies. Silent hill followed the game, RE did not."
5,Jacquie's reviews ..=0),"Very good creepy movie , about a coal mine burning and another dimension ..witch burnings , scary monsters ..a little girl with a complicated past ...and future"
5,Great Movie for SH fans,"this is the best video game/ to movie production I have seen better than Bloodrayne 2 if you have ever played SH 2 or 3 you will see characters and weapons used in the movie like the video game like static on Rose's cell phone, the steel pipe as a weapon Brook Haven hospital etc.. nothing from SH 4 in the movie great camera angles and done well with out being cheesyfavorite new movie in a long time"
4,Judged Too Harshly,"This movie looks great on DVD. It's crisp and clear, which was one of the problems I had seeing this in the theatre. The images were often muddy and the action hard to see clearly. These problems have been resolved on disc, and I have to say this movie makes for some really nice eye candy. Yes, there are script/plot/pacing problems, but I found myself totally engrossed in all the visuals this time around; Fans of the games(like me...)will get way more milage out this than just horror fans, but there is enough disturbing stuff here to satisfy most. Also, I fast forwarded by every scene with Sean Bean(Nothing personal...he is just totally wasted here...)except for the ones where he is searching in the town and the end. It shortened the movie by about 20 minutes and actually made it flow alot easier. Lots of nice game nods; An ending out of some Hellraiser movie on acid; But it is hard to deny Christophe Gans is a visual genius; I'm sure he'll only continue to get better..."
4,GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME,"WOW!!!!!!!!!!! Great movie. Probably the scariest movie that came out this year so far.It is about a woman who adopts a little girl who keeps having dreams about the city she was born in. Which was Silent Hill. Her mother takes her there and strangly, as there driving along. Variaties of people try to stop her from going there. But of course she doesn't listen. As she is driving, you see a police officer follow her. So they get to Silent Hill and the mother doesn't pay attention to the road and crashes and gets knocked out. When she wakes up, her daughter is gone. She goes into Silent Hill, hoping to get her daughter and leave. But ends up going through a world of strange, terrifying creatures, strange nosies, the risk of her life and ends of finding out about the strage past of Silent Hill, and also her daughter.Now if you are in for a good terror movie. SOmething that will make you jump, I do recommend this movie. Everyone should see it. I would give it an A-. Good."
4,Best Game Movie Adaptation,"I'm not sure what the original comment leaver saw last night, but it certainly wasn't Silent Hill.I saw a critic screening last night, and must say I was highly impressed. As a fan of the games, and anything related to them, my faith has been firmly established in Gans and Avery, and I can only wish for sequels.The atmosphere was perfect, the acting was on point, the creatures were amazing, well, everything was amazing.The town itself looks just like the town we love, and it's almost like coming home again. You'll see what I mean when you finally get to see the film.Just be prepared for a disturbing, bloody (oh man, the blood), and genuinely creepy ride.I'd say more, but giving spoilers would be like slapping you in the face.Go see it!"
4,if you played the video game,"you would understand the movie, i only played a few. but the movie made alot of sence. its a good movie if you have heard or even played the game."
4,Blu Ray Version Not the best HD Version,"Silent Hill is without a Doubt one of the Best/Coolest Video Game Adaptions to DateLooks so Good and the story is Scary and works in The Silent Hill UniverseThe BR Version is on the Other Hand a Bit off a so/so TransferIt's good at times sometimes Stunning But, Could be so Much more in 180i/180p PQIf you happen 2 be a Complete NUT like me and have Both HD Players (BR-Player & HD DVD Player)Find the German HD DVD Import of Silent HillIt's a much better and True to Hi Def TransferIf u only have a BR Player I'd hold out on itUntil There is a 2nd Print BR Version with a Complete Crisp Transfer with More Special FeaturesThe Movie is 9.6/10The Blu Ray Transfer 8.5/10"
3,Well,"While Silent Hill isn't my favorite horror movie, I love the concept and it's good enough to watch again once in a while.It looks like a sequel is slated to come out in 2010, which is good, because I think it's ripe for more stories on this theme, much like with the video game."
4,Silent Hill,"Silent hill is a movie based off a game series. Most of the time this results in a really bad movie, however silent hill did a fair job. If you are looking for action, then this movie isn't for you. There is a lot of blood and suspense. What makes this movie good though, is the art behind the story. The movie is much better from an interpretative point of view. The movie and artwork speaks about the dangers of extremism, fear, hatred, and staying silent when someone else is getting hurt. It does an excellent job of taking those emotions and displaying them on screen."
1,A subpar Blu-ray transfer,"I agree with the reviewers who say this transfer is no better than a standard DVD. I purchased this disc because the 1080p trailer available on the PS3 online store looked interesting and was very sharp. The transfer on this disc is inferior to the downloadable PS3 trailer. I disagree with the other reviewer who stated that the transfer was sharp and who disparages the negative reviewers for having inferior tv's.I have a 67"" DLP 1080p television that is ISF calibrated. The other blu-rays discs I've watched (Underworld Evolution, Devil Wears Prada; even the single-layer Talledega Nights freebie that came with the PS3 - which has a worse transfer than the retail double-layer unrated version) exhibited much better sharpness and clarity. The transfer on this disc is closer to a good upscaled standard DVD than a good Blu-ray or HD-DVD (which I also own).I give this movie a one-star because its the transfer is not worth the premium paid over the standard DVD version of the movie."
3,Pretty good,"Horror not being my favorite genre, this one ws pretty good, until it got really gory toward the end. I laughed out loud at the scene where Rose had to pass through the group of nurses who were arranged in line-dance formation, when they turned around en masse and staggered toward her. My son said, ""What's so funny?"" I said ""ITS JUST LIKE THRILLER!!!! How CAMPY can you get?"" Worth watching the whole movie just for that scene! Special features were really good, also."
1,Umm yea,"At the end of this movie, which i wasted 7 dollars 10 people at once said in unison, That was horrible. The movie isn't scary, the plot is patched together like a class of 1st graders trying to make a novel and they all have to write one page. The acting is well horrible. The visuals were cool but i think a lot of that was that they were on a big screen. Personally I laughed threw the whole thing and i guess my money was well spent cause all my buddy's were reference the horrible and pointless climatic scene."
1,Stupid movie,I got this movie because my bf wanted to go see the new one that just came out. After we watched this one we decided not to go see the new one. LOL
1,silrnt hill,"movie was no were close to the game was very disapointed in it,,hopefully they will make one closer to what the game was about"
1,Silent Hill (of beans),"What's the matter with hollywood these days? It seems they cannot come up with original ideas. So, they tap into past successes and make a mess of them... or... they tap into video games and bring them to the screen.All I have to say is that on paper the idea of this movie may have had some merit up until the point where the mother finally reaches the town. After that it becomes Mad Max versus The Hills Have Eyes.If you are a true horror movie fan, as I am, you may find yourself snoring through this one. It actually does not make sense once you get into the town and meet the creatures and people who live there.If I could, I would have given this a half a star. Don't waste your time or money... if you really want to see it wait until it's released on television, which should be soon."
1,SILENCE NOT SO GOLDEN,"Not being a fan of the video game that inspired this movie, I must admit I found it visually stunning but ultimately confusing and empty. From reading other reviews, some of the enormous plot holes make sense, but if a movie isn't honest enough to let all viewers know what's going on, then has it achieved its goal as entertainment?The sets, atmosphere and effects are marvelous, but the performances are lacking, with the exception of Alice Krige as the nutty spiritual leader. But once again, we have yet another movie in which a demonic little girl wants to possess another innocent little girl. Been there, done that, and frankly I wish writers would come up with something a little more inventive."
4,One of the good video game adaptations.,"This Blu-ray movie was worth the $14. It has decent video quality (not the best, but acceptable) and good sound quality. If you already own the DVD then an upconverter will probably be close to this Blu-ray copy. The movie is one of the better video game adaptations that has been made. Not quite near the quality of Resident Evil in my opinion, but this is still a very enjoyable movie. I gave this Blu-ray 4 stars out of 5 because the story, aduio, and picture quality were very good as a whole. Very happy with this purchase."
3,Not bad....,"I would say I liked this movie more than I disliked it. The acting was pretty good, effects were awesome, the plot was strong and I liked the ending. I was a little scared but I found the movie more creepy than scary. It's certainly better than a lot of horror/thriller stuff that has come out lately. It contained some fairly grusome stuff but was surprisingly low on actual blood and gore, I think it could have used more in this area. Also, I persoanlly think the whole 'gates of hell' concept is overdone in movies but I never played the game so maybe I am missing something here. The ambiance of the movie overall was wonderfully dark and it was well paced with good action. I did like it and I would watch it again and would suggest it to anyone who likes a good scary movie."
3,Actually looks good despite...,This movie is the best recreation of a game. From the music to the environment. The people at Konami should use this as an example to what their next gen game should look like. Now after watching the PS3 trailer I really wanted to purchase this movie despite what others have said about the picture quality. The movie is far from award worthy but it does really utilize the Blu-ray. At least as far as picture. I found the movie looked really good with a crisp picture and superb resolution. Despite what some people have said I can only think they have less than a 1080p t.v. Overall the movie is hardly scary and doesn't seem to have anything redeming. I wanted to have something pull me in. Whether it was a character's performance on the visuals. Nothing grabbed me. Even with some horror movies that aren't very good you still get a little comedy. Not here. This may be one of the best videogame adaptations but as far as watchability I would say go somewhere else.
3,"Lots of atmosphere, little else..","Silent Hill has a lot of great special effects - which saves it from being a total waste of time. The story centers around a woman searching for clues to her adopted daughter's origins in an abandoned mining town called ""Silent Hill"".The movie takes the viewer on a tour of the wraith - filled town, that periodically morphs into a Hellish nightmare. The special effects are very interesting but the film does not have a cohesive ending and sputters to an confusing conclusion.Silent Hill is not an awful film, but it is not a great film either."
2,not up to par,Brotherhood of the Wolf- far superior- writing-acting. Effects good- relied on special effects too often. The story line needed to be developed in order to make sense
2,games are better,"Not much really to say, I just didn't really care for the movie. Husband likes playing the games better then watching this movie."
3,It is okay,"I was hoping it would be scarier, it is kind of weird. But I like more of a classic horror."
4,"Very solid,","Sadly, a film of this genre is often simply an excuse to engage in special-effects excess, and, in terms of any positive content, very little else. Fortunately, this title brings much more to the table. Yes, there are special effects in Silent Hill, but they are actually quite understated, and they never become self-indulgent or otherwise upstage the cast. The mood and feel of the video game is present, but the film's story is entirely accessible to everyone, game-player or not. The performances are generally solid throughout, with little to nit-pick about. Clearly, this sort of film isn't everyone's cup of tea, but most horror film fans should be very pleased. This is a tight little gem of a horror movie."
4,Truly Bizarre...,I had no idea this movie was based on a video game. It is absolutely the most bizarre and visually disturbing movie I have watched since Jacob's Ladder. I will probably check out the video game after seeing this.I gave it 4 stars because of the barely there plot. It seemed like the movie was just hell bent on cramming in as much SFX as possible. The scene with the nurses towards the end of the film was really spooky. I would never be able to pass through them.
2,In My Restless Dreams I See That Town....Silent Hill.,"Ok, A lot of good in this film...and a lot of bad. Its important to know Im a huge fan of the video game series so thats how Im reviewing this movie. The film starts off REAL strong. Lot of good ideas/scenes/acting. But the last 30 maybe 40 minutes of the film killed it for me. Without giving away anything story wise, lets just say the last 40 minutes not Silent Hill style at all. Feels like your watching two different films all together.Now, with that being said its seems every silent hill fan is different. Some LOVE this film. I am really confused why if they are a fan of the video game series. Long story short, I own the film and watch it from time to time. Its a good stand alone film but not as a silent hill film."
4,its ok,this is a great movie to watch on your psp. tho i dont think its as good as resident evil 4 the action fact. but it is pretty scary but not pee your panties scary.
1,Great visuals... but where are the screenwriters?,"This film is one long beautiful piece of Art Director's delight. Every frame is a visual feast.But that is all.The script is incomprehensible and makes no sense whatsoever. The first half of the film is just the mother running after an irritating little girl who won't stop. The second half is impossible to understand... But it has to do with witches, a molested child, a crazy cult, freak monsters and a group of nurses who should be on that Madonna video ""Nothing Really Matters"" (that was what they reminded me of) LOL.This is the example of a film that follows so close a game structure that it ends up being just a hollow and uninteresting game narrative without the game parts... like if someone had sewed together all the exposition parts of the game.Dull."
3,It was okay...,"As for being a fan of the series, I left the theater with mixed feelings after seeing the movie adaption. I loved the cameos of the monsters but I felt that this movie doesn't have that same feeling I get when I play the games. And not to mention the story. I think what they should have done was to leave the story alone. Because if they are going to make a sequel a la SH3 style it would probably be as poorly written as this (actually, I feel that they should have make SH2 into a movie instead). And it kind of makes me cringe that they changed Harry's role into a woman because it's more appealing.Pros:+ Familiar monsters (Pyramid Head!)+ Setting captured the tone+ Slighlty better than other video game movies.Cons:- Poorly adapted story- Unapealing characters- Non-fans will be confused"
2,True fans of the game will end up disappointed,"The movie starts out pretty good, and I must say that the music and the visuals are incredible in this movie. However, WHY did they change the cult mythology that was essential to the silent hill game? Instead of a pseudo-satanic cult trying to give life to a demon, the movie has a wacked out fundamentalist christian cult that wanted to cleanse evil. That made NO sense, and it really detracted from what would otherwise have been an acceptable adaptation of a frightening video game."
5,Review,"I recently lost my copy of Silent Hill and was having severe withdrawals from the movie! So, of course I had to buy it again!!! This is my favorite movie of all time!"
4,silent hill,I have seen many horror movies and this one scared me so bad I fell out of my seat. Some parts are kind of confusing but it was scary. The ending is surprising and one of the parts I did not like.
4,The Best Game Movie,"Let's just say it wasn't the best movie but I liked it. The creatures were what made the movie for me! They were so weird and creepy that it made Resident Evil and DOOM look like rag dolls! I've never played Silent Hill and I heard if you have the movie will suck, but the movie makes me want to buy the original! Anyway people are complaining that the FX look fake. Well I did some research and found out that most of the creatures were people in costume! HA! And besides stop complaining about how real it's suppose to look! You can't make everything look too real! Do we play video games to complain about the graphics? No! We do it to have fun, that's what a movie is for."
3,Good but...,"Silent Hill achieved the 'Best Video game to movie' tag in my opinion...Which considering what it was up against with all due respect, wasn't that difficult!However, it is a good movie. It's just one of those movies which sadly could have been better. The hype, the anticipation, from Silent Hill fans like myself waiting for this movie was unbelievable. And once I got to see it, I did have mixed feelings.It starts wonderfully, and the imagery throughout is fantastic. Somewhere through the middle though it loses it a little and forgets it's a 'Silent Hill' movie/story, and tries too hard to tie loose ends.It's not bad-I wanted this movie to be fantastic and mess with my mind like the original PS1 game did...but expected it to be awful. In the end it landed somewhere in the middle with a movie I like but felt wasn't quite there. If you like the game, and you like the horror movie genre, go in with an open mind and you should find a movie you enjoy as a watchable but not a classic flick."
3,The movie may not be the best...,"Coming from one who can only fall asleep to horror films (Texas Chainsaw Massacre is my sleep-aid), I have to say I like this film. Most of all, I love the scenery. I truly appreciate the sets. The movie keeps me awake (which for a horror film is rare) long enough to enjoy the work they must've put into it. Very few films spark my interest in such a way. The plot line is relatively thin, the actors do their best, but the scenery (for me, anyway) was worth it."
2,Less Than Expected,"Going into this movie I was expecting an edge of your seat thriller from my experience with the game, to my disappointment I found myself nodding off from boredom after 30 minutes. This movie could have been far more interesting and entertaining by foregoing the two realities which I don't remember being in the game. The ending also turned me off completely, it was one of those ungratifying ones that leave you feeling like you wasted two hours. The story was interesting at points but it took far to long to develop the plot almost felt like it was trying to fill time to make it longer. Rent it first for you may regret doing that."
3,"It has style, but substance?","I went and saw this back when it was making its last rounds in the box office. I was not a big player of the game. I have not even touched the games. I just went into Silent Hill blindly like the mother did when she went into Silent Hill searching for her daughter. Basically, the whole movie is her ecountering strange and weird things while searching. It has great style, and the acting was top notch. But, It was confusing for us non gamers or players of the game. It was a good watch though."
2,Pointless,Meh. Didn't like it and it really didn't make much sense. Just pointless. Had quite a lot of symbolism though.
4,Silent Hill - review - Good,"After being prompted to watch the original Silent Hill prior to seeing the new Release, I'm glad I purchased original Silent Hill movie. I thought this was a pretty good horror/sci-fi movie. It had a good twisted plot. The whole holier-than-thou town aspect with the witch philosophy going on.... I thought it had a lot of good memorable scenes... the school bathroom scene, the whole edge of town thing, where if you leave, you fall in into this deep trench, the decent down into the hell, where the beast lives and getting by all of the no faced nurses was really good. I was not as impressed with the ending as I was anticipating. I thought it could have been a little more creative. But, all-in-all, pretty good movie... will watch again several times. Waiting for the new 3d Silent Hill to come out on blu-ray."
2,Not worth it,"I am a guy who loves horror movies, the more scary or disturbing the better. I thought this looked pretty good and scary but it really was not ... more of a thriller than a horror."
1,"If you don't play the game, don't see the movie","Even without knowing the background of this game to movie, it was HORRIBLE. The acting was so bad no wonder they didn't release this to the critics. Even the 6 kids that I took to see this, and know the plot, thought it sucked."
1,This movie was terrible,"I am somewhat happy to hear that this movie was based on a game. I am a 42 yr old father who LOVES horror movies. I thought this movie was the pits. Truly the pits. I am shocked there have been any positive reviews. It was not scary, not in the least. The storyline didn't flow and there were large holes and things that just didn't make sense. I heard audible sighs throughout the theater during the whole movie....and yes, some were coming from me. Pass on this film."
1,Laughable,"There really isn't much to say about this movie. It's basically 2 hours of a woman being attacked by strange monsters while she looks for her daughter. The story is extremely weak, and makes very little sense. The acting is cheesy. The only positive thing I can say about the movie is that it was nice to look at. Just gets old real fast. I really can't recommend this movie, although some may be dazzled to amusement."
1,The triumph of evil,"I went to see this movie because I was intrigued by the creepy creatures shown in the previews and the mystery of what had happened to the town. What I got was a sick, demonic revenge fantasy, with several scenes of disgusting and disturbing violence that I find difficult to get out of my mind. Although some of the creatures are truly unique, creepy, and well rendered, and the use of sound and music to affect mood are pretty good, everything else about the movie is just horrible. A grotesque caricature of religious fundamentalism, scenes of horrible violence, and a conclusion that offers not even the slightest shred of redemption for any of the characters, just the total triumph of evil, hatred, violence, and death. Reprehensible trash."
1,Terrible...,"Im gonna make this simple, if your a fan of the game this movie may spark up some interest for you. However, anyone else who wants to watch a good horror movie, trust me this isn't it. Its way to long, boring, and serously lacking a good plot. I'm sorry if this makes anyone mad, its just a personal opinion..."
3,Creepy Atmosphere and Cool CGI Creatures,"I won't be dumping this one in my neighbor's yard-sale bin like I will my copy of the unrated version of The Hills Have Eyes. I say this because I don't like misogynistic horror films, which are too prevalent now, and the Hills Have Eyes has an unnecessary and offensive scene to women in my opinion. No, I'm not necessarily a feminist. I just know what I'm seeing and I don't enjoy that in my scary movies! Silent Hill had enough for me to get past the totally misogynistic barbed wire in the ** scene. It at least has cool CGI creatures, intelligent plot, decent acting, very creepy atmosphere and a fitting musical score.And that's why I'm keeping this one!..;-)"
3,Fear City meets The Ring,"Fine cinematograghy and exceptional computer graphics are the highlights of this rather dark (visually) new entry to the videogame to movie genre. As usual, with this genre amd the comicbook to movie genre, we're a little short on storyline and long on nonsensical coincidence. With these obvious shortcomings you'd wonder why the filmmakers would think they could sustain your interest for two hours. Well, the fact of the matter is, they don't really get rolling till after the the first half hour but they still could have easily wrapped-it-up in the next hour.On the plus-side, the computer grachics were some of the best I've ever seen. Much of the success of the graphics were enabled by the sound effects. The blend was very effective and almost good enough to make Silent Hill worthwhile. Time might find it to be a benchmark, something like: Tron, Starship Troopers, Silent Hill."
2,Everything was okay but...,"With the shipping and how everything looks like was god. And the movie worked very good, but the movie is full of sh*** everyone told me the movie is so good and scary. You have to watch it before you watch the second one in the movies. So I ordered here and now I don't want see the second one anymore. The movie was okay, but not scary. And the quality how they made the movie look very cheap. Maybe I'm the only one who said that. But that's okay. I don't like the movie. An everyone has a different taste.Regards Flo"
3,Crazy creepy,This is a off the wall horror movie. Great for the Halloween weekend. See it before you see the original.
4,Not bad for a video game movie,This movie wasn't too bad considering it was based on a video game. It could have been a little shorter but I enjoyed it overall. If you like scary movies then you may enjoy it as well.
3,"Not Great, But a Lot of Fun","The atmosophere, musical score and special effects in Silent Hill were just great. The writing was weak, though, and the story and acting suffer as a result. While it was a whole lot of fun to watch, it would have been much cooler if the storyline had produced the kind of ""jump out of your seat"" suspense that I experienced watching ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Signs"".Still, it was definitely worth the $4 rental fee and 2 hours on a Friday night!"
5,wow!,"when i saw this the first time, i couldn't believe my eyes. this was impressive on a whole new level. they completely got the hellish style down. the only silent hill game i have played was #3 so i kind of knew what to expect. what shocked me was some of the extreme graphic depictions in this movie. i don't want to spoil it at all, but when i get shocked as i did watching this, i have to at least give it an extremely good or extremely bad review.i loved everything from the enviroment (ash falling everywhere, milky white atmosphere) to the ending (another thing i don't want to spoil) they used CGI to its fullest potential here. if you are at all into the video games, you will like this. if you like horror movies in general, this has more then enough to keep you entertained."
3,Strong and Intense Scent,"I love my jasmine plant and wanted it wear its beautiful scent. I searched online and read all the rave reviews of Le Jasmin and was very excited for its arrival. When I sprayed it on, it was so intense and overpowering...like the scent of my plant x3 with a mix of another flower. Now I spray it on a tissue first before rubbing it on."
5,"Impressive, informative, occasionally controversial.","Bonnie Gaunt is a mathematician and theologian who in Beginnings: The Sacred Design presents a fascinating and informative study on the Sacred Geometry of Stonehenge, the Great Pyramid, and other structures of ancient time. Of particular interest is her presentation on how the process of photosynthesis reveals the sacred design common to such antiquarian edifices , the Bible's number code (gematria) with respect to the ""sacred design"", and more. Beginnings: The Sacred Design is an impressive, challenging, informative, occasionally controversial, very welcome contribution to metaphysics and the eloquent designs of creation as employed and exemplified by the inspired builders of antiquity."
1,TERRIBLE is actually too nice of a way to describe this.,"I bought the video for my niece who is a big Rihanna fan. I understand this is an ""unofficial bio"" for Rihanna but the video was more like a powerpoint presentation. There were diagrams, charts and images that looked to have been pulled offline. There was so much focus on the history of things such as Barbados, the beginnings of crack cocaine, and the history of Def Jam and Jay-Z, amongst other things that it just took away from the person it was supposed to be speaking about. I'm quite glad that I used a promo certificate to buy this."
2,Too stiff,"The ride is nice over smooth roads and little bumps, but big bumps aren't taken too well. If I had to do it over again I would have gotten linear springs instead."
1,"junk sensors,,,it's from x-10 so becareful","It's very important to have motion sensors inside a house but the sensors were the most disappointing part about this security system.I installed the motion sensors just as indicated, however you could dance around them and they would not detect any motion. At first I though that particular one was damaged so I tried the other one and the same thing. They do work, but it would only detect motion after like a minute. Meaning that if someone broke into your property they could bypass the motion sensors. I was walking up and down left and right on front of both sensors and only afte 45 seconds is when the red light lit up and the alarm sounded off."
4,"Good device, works just as advertise.","Good device, works just as advertise.I just needed it to go with my X10 system and it worked fine."
3,Not terribly helpful for self-instruction,"The content of the book is good, as it provides a comfortable progression from basic to complicated playing styles. However, there isn't anaccompanying CD or tape. If you don't read music; or you are unable to figure out the timing of a song from the tableture, it's difficult to know what the music and exercises are supposed to sound like. This goes for all banjo instruction books. Do not buy any without an accompanying CD, unless you have a more advanced player or instructor who knows the songs."
4,Great songs with an inspirational message of hope.,This lady has a great voice. A coworker told me about the CD and I came on line and bought it. I thought the sound was unique especially for an African American woman. There was great variety on the project and I did not get bored with it at all. I did not understand the correlation between the title of the project and the songs on the project but other than that it was great!!
4,Great DVD,"I showed this to my 4 year olds, this past weekend, and it was a hit. Sydney is awesome and it is so much more than just yoga.My only reservation is that the time between poses can be a little short. They moved through them quickly, so maybe more appropriate for children that have been doing yoga for a while. I'm sure mine will adjust once they've seen it a few more times."
3,not much yoga,"I think the story is beautiful first off, however, I don't feel there is enough yoga poses in the video. My 4 and a half year old daughter will replay the pose review section that is available. Even after the first time viewing it she said, 'that's it?'.... But she does enjoy the story and loves to sit there and listen. I just wish there was more movement. More of a sit down story, but then again, even a little yoga is better than none!"
5,I was surprised,My daughter is not yet three and yet I showed the DVD to her today and she cried to have it played two more times today. She couldn't get enough. I don't do yoga yet wish I had taken it up years ago and thus became motivated to expose my daughter at an early age. I was washing dishes and watched her try all the poses.....of course she wasn't doing them perfectly even though they are simple but the fact that she was fascinated and was translating the information into her body was so cute to watch. And it was a bonus that Spanish is also gently introduced. And the message is profound yet simple enough for a child to digest. Bravo!
2,"Cute story, not really any yoga","Our 3-yr-old son watched intently during the story, but unfortunately the yoga aspect of the video was very disappointing. I was hoping they would present the poses in a way that was easy for a child to learn them; on the contrary, they went through them so fast and held them for so short a period, that it was difficult for even adults to follow. The re-creation of the story with yoga poses was a cute idea, but it was somewhat forced and did not ""flow"". There are better options for stories and yoga (independent of each other). For yoga, we likedYoga For Families: Connect With Your Kidsmuch better."
3,Very Difficult To Read,This book is unorganized and laid out in a confusing manner. There are no chapters and stories run into one another. There are more stories of murders and crime than monsters. Many have been written about before and too much space is devoted to common stories anyone into the bizzarre has heard already.
1,Just like Jordan playing for the Wizards,Smart entertainers quit while they're on top so that the last thing we remember is their greatness. This album was made after DMC permanently lost his voice and one can't help but question if the slow weak style (but strong rhymes) on this album are a reflection of that. If you loved watching Jordan play for the Wizards as much as you did when he played for the Bulls then you'll love hearing DMC on this album as much as you did in the past. I unfortunately do not. Regretably this is not the same great POWERFUL DMC I remember from the good ol days.
1,Not for creams,If you imagined the hot shaving cream one used to get at barber shops than you will be disappointed. Not a very good product. I'm giving mine away.
4,no problems yet,"I just received the product..assembly was really fairly easy..Just read the instructions and read them again before you start..myself I had no problems like some other reviewers had..It work great no problems..at least as of yet, still new..I use gel and it does get warm but not really hot but it sure does make a difference.."
1,Please don't waste you $$$$$$,I'll keep it simple. DO NOT buy this Conair model. It's plain garbage. Try one of the other models. They cost more but at least they work correctly..
4,It's ok.,"Product is ok. The shaving cream can is hard to get in place. Directions don't help much. I don't think I will buy this product again. However, the seller was fantastic!! Arrived in just a few days!! :)"
2,Not compatible with Nivea cans,"A HUGE con: at the moment when I bought it the product page stated that the item is compatible with most cream/gel cans, but it's not compatible with Nivea brand ones (which is stated on the box, by the way). Nivea isn't such a minor brand (and is the one I used to use all the time) that it's not worth even mentioning it in the description, especially given it is mentioned on the packaging! So I had to switch to a different brand, which I'm not very pleased with. Also the gel (I didn't try to use it with foam though) cools too quickly after I put it on my face, so it doesn't do the job of warming up my skin at all.I consider it pretty much a waste of my money.In addition, I saw this product in a local discount store for half the price the other day. I believe I bought it for $15 on 08/19/10 and now its price on Amazon is about $13."
1,Hot Gel Lather Machine,"This product did not fit the standard shaving cream container like ""EDGE"", ""Gillette"", ""Johnson"" ""SKINTIMATE"" by S.C. Johnson or any other manufacturer because the retaining ring that clasps under the lip of the shave cream container was not manufactured correctly. The older model of which we had for 5 years (probably made in the USA) was manufactured correctly & lasted until the heating element gave up the Ghost after 1,825 uses. The newer model (probably made in CHINA) looks cheaper made and not able to clasp on the lip of the shave cream due to the part that clasps is too small & wrong angle & poor quality. It was NOT a FUN experience for me. We'll shop for a better model made in the USA. Thank you.~Lin."
2,"Hot Gel/Lather Machine, Black","I have it, got it in good time, packaged really well, but the assembly instruction are very evasive a cumbersome."
1,Would not work on the 2nd can of shave cream.,This worked fine on the first can but would not work at all on the second can. I tried everything and it just would not work.
2,Does not work well with Lather Cans,"Sorry to say, but this product did not work as promised. The black canister does not hold any type or brand of Lather can, only Gel type cans. I did call the customer service number and asked why this is, and the rep told me that it is a Type - O on the package. In order to use with a Lather can, you just put the device on the top of the can and use as is. The older Model product did fit the lather type cans, but this one does not. Sorry but if you are going to use this with a lather can, you might want to get the older White Model. The product looks starange when you cant use the Black canister as pictured."
1,Not worth it!,I ordered this item for my husband and I was extremely disappointed. It is poorly made and basically is not worth the money. I do not recommend it at all.
3,"Great when it works, but leaks","This is great when it works and it heats up quickly. It has weak seals and leaks foam/gel easily causing it to be messy after every use. Also, the unit is a little bulkier than I expected for counter space. It is effective for the price, but I would not buy another one."
4,men love it,"Both my husband and my teenage son love the warm lather. My husband did have a bit of trouble first setting it up, but it is working great now. I would highly recommend this."
4,Hot shave cream dispenser,"This is a different model than my old one uses gel or foam shave cream. Work very well so far with cream, have not tried gel yet. These are getting very hard to find."
1,Where's the Heat?,"I bought this item to replace an older Conair hot lather machine that finally quit.This newer version (HGL1) simply doesn't get the lather hot.Seek out the older version (Conair HLM10)and buy that instead. It is a few dollars more, but does a better job.I'm tossing my newer version and replacing it with one of the older ones. Too bad for me....money wasted!CONAIR CORP PERS CARE #HLM10 Hot Lather Machine"
2,Still not good enough..,"This is the second unit purchased, the first one didn't have any heat controls, and this latest unit does,Model HGL2, but the lather becomes too thin, and continues to drip at the nozzle leaving a mess each time. I do shake the can before each shave.I tried gel, and that was just a big mess, the can kept hoozing out gel and got it all over the place, what a mess. Sorry, but they need to make a special gel or lather just for that machine.Over the counter gels and lathers just don't work well with this invention. Not worth all the trouble for a little heat."
2,Hard to set up,This was very hard to set up. I almost broke it and wasted 1/2 can of gel. Poor directions. Gel is only warm at the highest setting. Would not buy again. Claims to heat lotion but does not say how.
2,NOT WORTH IT!,"NOT WORTH IT ! IF MY HOT LATHER MACHINE BROKE TODAY, I WOULDN'T REPLACE IT. I SHOULD OF BELIEVED ALL THE OTHER REVIEWS THAT SAID IT WASN'T WORTH IT."
1,Tepid lather.,Warm lather not hot. Bought one a year ago and it was much better. Would not buy again.Price was cheap as was quality.
3,"WARM,NOT HOT","The Conair HGL1 Combo Hot Gel/Lather Machine works OK but even at the temperature set @ high, the lather is barely warm. I haven't tried the Gel feature yet but assume it will be the same. Do I need to get the more expensive Conair Lather Heater/s to get hotter lather? Anyone with similarcondition?"
1,Conair lather machine,"This product is useless ! The gel does not get hot enough , it comes out as some form of toxic goo and it smells like burnt cheese . I used it for a week and then tossed it in the garbage . $20 WASTED."
1,Hot lather .. for awhile,"I ordered two of these units, and both broke within a few months ... the shaving cream stops coming through the heating unit ... tried numerous cans of shaving cream, even took one of the units apart to see if it could be cleaned out. Looks like the 'release' mechanism is either poorly designed, or fails w. use. Great idea ... but needs more design work. Probably better to just heat the whole can w. a low wattage heater. ..."
2,Not the best product,"After one use I am returning this to the store. I shave with lather and discovered that the heat provided by this unit degrades the lather. I actually had to use twice as much lather to get the same coverage as lather straight from the can.I had the unit set to it's highest heat setting. The lather was luke warm at best and by the time I applied it to my face, it was as cold as it would have been straight from the can. I don't recommend this product. It's a waste of money."
5,redeye262,"The Conair HGL1 combination hot Gel/Lather Machine is the best thing I have purchesed for my self. I use a cheep gel and this is the easy 1,2,3 instrctions and the gel comes out as hot as you want it. As the directions say just turn it on before you get through brushing your teeth it is hot in seconds and ready. The unit comes with two tips, one for cream and the other for gel."
3,Hot Lather Machine,Wasn't very happy with this machine. Worked well at first but not for long. They don't make then like they use to I guess.
1,Not impressed,"The item description shows a changeable nozzle for lather and gel. My box came with two nozzles for lather which started my doubt for this product. I decided to try it anyway and deal without being able to use gel. I plugged it in and while waiting for it to heat up, shaving cream started spewing around the black circle at the top and jammed the buttons with cream. I was not happy with this product and returned it immediately."
5,Hot lather review,Great product and great price. Also delivery was prompt and the unit works just as advertised.
1,wasted money,used this product once and it stopped putting out cream. had one before that lasted longer.
5,Conair HGL1 Combination Hot Gel/Lather Machine,"It's a great machine, I like it. It's easy to use and reliable. The main thing to insure good operation is to remove nozzle after each use and rinse it out with warm water. It's a little time consuming but it's worth it. I use it with the lather."
4,does the job,"...I ordered this for my husband and it can be messy. It tends to flow out and you always have mess on the front. If after about an hr after use you wipe it, it will stop oozing. It warms quickly and my husband likes it."
1,Does not perform!,"I owned a similar type unit 20+ years ago that worked very well, unfortunately the modern versions just don't perform well. Once you follow the installation instructions (which require you to be rather mechanically inclined) the results are a disappointing luke-warm lather. Even on the highest heat setting the lather doesn't reach a high enough temperature and cools significantly just in the time to spread it on your face. Save your money!"
1,Terrible product,"We couldn't figure out how to use this product; it is much harder to use than it needs to be. Additionally, it was shipped to us with shaving cream already on the nozzle; clearly someone had used it and then returned it. I would never buy this product, or any other product from this seller, again."
1,This thing is so frustrating,I recieved this as a christmas present and was anxious to try it out. Major disappointment when my Nivea gel wasn't capatable. Of course there's no recommendations in the packaging as for what brands work. Went to the store just to get a regular can of shaving cream. Snapped the can in place and it emptied the most of it before I could figure out what was wrong. Now the inside of the dispensor and where it connects is all covered in shaving cream. I couldn't really rinse it out because there's a heating element and risk of electrical shock. Tried a couple more times...ended up throwing it across the room and yelled a little. I wouldn't recommend it.
2,Pretty stupid,"That's what I thought of this when it came out, when I was a big Fall fan. And I still think it's pretty stupid. I like the fragmented bass-driven drone of the title track, and ""Carry Bag Man"" has enough energy to be tolerable. But most of this - come on. Let's get serious. This is uninspired, too static musically to be of interest, and just plain goofy. It signaled a real down turn for the band."
2,Needs updated narration,"London's chronoligical, tightly coupled tales of Fish Patrol fights with oyster pirates, Greek scofflaw salmon poachers and more is marred by this 1982 audio production with low audio quality and a narrator that is just phoning it in."
3,A Different Portrayal of Events.,"This foreign film gives us a picture of World War II from a different perspective. The young boy was a chess wiz and with his memory helped to keep his mother's crusade alive. There is much violence in this movie based on the novel DADDY by Loup Durand, but then that was how life was in Germany and France in those tumultous years.It was interesting to see a movie made where that kind of thing really occurred in the 1940s. It was much better than seeing top name American actors pretending. These actors made it appear almost real.I can't say why I bought the DVD, could be the enigmatic pose of Thomas Sangster. The photo on the front makes you want to hug that child."
2,Philosophical rantings are off track,The movie is slow and seems jumbled together. There are philosophical rantings from a philosophy professor and a lot of talk about the game of chess. I like chess but when it becomes part of the theme of a movie then the word boring enters into the description. The scripting is poor and the director is low level at best. save your money.
4,Oakland Classic,"This album is a classic. When it first came out, Every Mustang 5.0, Ford Falcon and Cougar in the 'Town was slappin this CD on the Foothill strip. This album was also the jump off for 3x Krazy, the original group of Keak Da Sneak.This CD is a typical West Coast CD. When people think of West Coast, they think of gangsta rap or g-funk. This is Mobb Music. Straight Bay Area sound that influenced Houston and Kansas City. If you're not into Mobb Music, this CD isn't for you. If you were from the Bay and came up during the mid 90's, the height of Mobb Music, this CD is a must have. It is definitely worth the $38 for any old school Bay Area rap fan and is a collector's item."
2,Not what I expected,"I was disappointed in this book when I received it. I was looking for ways to make my H.S. History class more exciting, but I found that most of the suggestions in the book were geared more for the elementary school levels. The format of the book is set-up more like a comic book than an academic book and is filled with cartoon drawings and funny sayings. Although it was fun to read, I really did not feel that I acquired any useful knowledge from it1"
4,Lighten up!,"All teachers should teach like this -- it works so much better than standing around glaring when things go wrong!After I read it, I wondered why I had bought it -- I already do so much of what it mentions -- but then one day I realized that the book had worked its magic in an unexpected way; it changed my attitude. I may use humor and laughter when I teach, but what about when something goes wrong? That's the moment to use humor. I needed to lighten up my ATTITUDE; being ""fun"" for the kids to learn with is different than being fun when things go wrong. I turned some bad moments into teachable moments, and all because I stopped taking MYSELF so seriously. Their attitude change (and a difficult class!) reflected the success. It turned into a great day.I highly recommend this book -- especially if you are an authoritarian-type teacher. BUY IT!"
4,Excellent reminder for everyone!,"I got this for my daughter's teacher. After reading it I can see how it can help me be a better, more playful and understanding parent. You really have to read through the activities to see what ages they might work with, but the time is well-spent."
3,Gimmicks to make students laugh,"I use laughter in my classroom. I struggle bringing students back from the laughter and keeping the students from going to far, that is keeping them from crossing the line between fun and chaos. I was hoping to see ideas and strategies in this book that would help me with these issues. I didn't find what I wanted. Instead, the book is filled with gimmicks to make students laugh. It isn't bad, but it isn't what I was hoping for. I'll try some of the gimmicks, but most of the ideas weren't in line with my style. I don't feel that this book was worth the time I devoted to it."
2,Very disappointing!,"After reading the reviews published, I was really excited to get this video. To my disappointed I found out this is by no means a video for beginners of Tai Chi, if you don't know your way around, there is no way you will be able to follow this video. I also found that the sound and lighting was very poor. Overall, I do not think this video is worth the money."
1,Not professionally done,"I was very disappointed with this video. I wanted a beginning Tai Chi video, and this was not close to any others I have seen. It looks like someone took their video camera and filmed someone doing Tai Chi in a field somewhere and then when to her house to finish up. Most unprofessional."
2,Got the seeds wet,"I love the look of the feeder. Unfortunately, it let water get into the feeder, and turned the thistle into a stinky mess of goop. My finches went to the regular bird feeder next to it, they hardly ever ate from this one."
4,No Seed Tray,I just wanted to point out that the bird feeder did NOT come with the seed tray as pictured. It is available for $8.32 separately.
1,Birds won't use it,"I did a lot of research into attracting birds to our yard and this type of feeder was recommended. I bought the feeder in September of 2012, bought fresh seed, filled the feeder and hung it up. Unfortunately not one bird has eaten from it since we hung it up. I noticed yesterday that there is a big crack extending from the bottom of the feeder about three or four inches up. I don't know that the feeder is responsible for the lack of birds, but because of the crack I can't recommend the feeder to anyone."
5,Bird Quest Spiral Bird Feeder,This was just what I was looking for. I had purchased one in the past and had a hard time finding a replacement. It is just what I wanted.
3,Not a Fave of the Finches,"It took our house and gold finches many weeks to warm up to this feeder, and when placed side by side with our old single perch type, most of them would line up and wait for an open perch on the old feeder before using this new type. I guess it's not just old dogs that are difficult to teach new tricks."
2,Not very durable,"After going only 3/4 mile around the neighborhood with my dog and his new Muttluks, these shoes were all worn and frayed. I used some epoxy to seal the worn holes, but since then have resorted to buying more expensive but durable shoes. These shoes also don't have much grip on the bottom, so unless your dog is walking on concrete, asphalt or grass, he'd be slipping all over the place as mine did. These shoes are generally easy for your dog to walk in, as they are flexible and the ""socks"" help them stay on--but unless you plan on having your dog wear these in the yard or something, I wouldn't recommend them."
5,The Reforming of Matthew Dunn - an emotionally packed story,"that pulls at your heart. Virginia Kantra weaves a magic with her pen, creating characters that truly come to life. Clare Harmon is a woman who's known loss, but is strong enough to risk her heart again when she meets Matthew Dunn. Matt is a man who's seen society at its worst, but in Clare he sees only the best. Asking her to take a chance on him seems too much, but he doesn't take into account that Clare's not the type to wait to be asked - she just gives her all. This book isn't just something you should read - it's something you must read."
4,su nombre ya es sinonimo de proteccion,"Todos los que provenimos de una familia de origen latinoamericano o hemos estudiado algun libro de historia de america entendemos las grandes injusticias que se cometieron en la epoca de la conquista de america, pero no todo fue asi, de la oscuridad y corrupcion salio una luz que trajo esperanza para los indios, su nombre ya es sinonimo de proteccion y lucha contra la injusticia de lo hombres, este libro toma a este Fraile Dominico Bartolome de Las Casas y lo saca de la oscuridad para presentarlo como era un hombre con una gran compasion y amor por el projimo."
5,Wordless Interpretations of Al Stewart's Songs,"Dave Nachmanoff is a major talent in the play of the acoustic guitar and has backed up Al Stewart as he tours in clubs and shows around the world. Dave has worked to produce a unique interpretation here of some of Al's familiar songs. ""In Brooklyn"", ""Flying Sorcery"", ""Merlins Time"", and the ever popular ""Year of the Cat"", changing them in tempo or rythmn to create a new adventure down the road of familarity. If you are a fan of Mr. Stewart, then you will appreciate this work of tribute. The picture in the listing was taken at a private concert at ""The Point"" coffee house in Bryn Mawr Pennsylvania when Al & Dave shared a light moment (no doubt after a bit of wine!)"
5,another concentrated item from shire,"while the titles in the shire series are booklets, not books, they all contain an incredible number of, admittedly black and white, photos and informed text.this little volume includes photos of patchwork from, among others, nomadic african and asian cultures, notes on 'american' patchwork, and, of course, quiet a bit about british piecing and quilting.most quilters would find surprises in this booklet, and it would also be of interest to other textile artists.it's a shame it's out of print."
4,Amazing condition and Book,It was in excellent condition and Has some lovely prayers from different walks of faith. A great book of prayers for espiritistas and Spiritualists!
3,Good but not great,"I chose to read this play because firstly, Anthony Burgess mentioned it in his book ""English Literature"" (1857) and secondly, because it was a short play. Or maybe even thirdly - the central theme [incest] it deals with is treated in an entirely different manner from other literary works. The nature of the incest is frank and horrifying. The intensity of the unlawful relationship is compromised by the coarsening of Giovanni's love for Annabella; their ethereal relationship gradually loses its innocence in the course of the play, culminating in Annabella's pregnancy and finally her death in Giovanni's hands.While we certainly cannot put Ford in the ranks of Shakespeare, he deserves credit for a play whose themes of sexual jealousy, revenge, violence and incent intertwine in a most heartrending way."
4,routine maintenance item,"These are the original replacement plugs specified for my PCM 351 carbureated engine, standard output. The ceramic will crack and break if you put a side load on the plug as you tighten it, so use a little care."
5,Poor Huggly's adventures are great fun to read!,"My son (4.5 years old) wants us to read him this book, and the other Huggly books, every night. He laughs at the story, which is a riot. His favorite parts are the hugs, and the monster's face when he gets hugged. The pictures are wonderfully ridiculous, especially the bug-eyed big people."
5,Blunt is best...,"I am a drama student at the University of Montana, and we are utilizing Blunt's texts and tapes in our two-year Voice and Speech program. They are invaluable to learning and understanding the various accents and dialects of several major world regions, with or without the tapes. I recommend both books and the tapes to anyone looking for specific instructions on improving their regional voice."
4,Brilliant book but,"well, here's the deal. This is the best dialect book out there today,but it's old fashioned in a way. there are no IPA symbols and at times the ones in the book are confusing and incorrect. the audio tapes REALLY help though, Highly recommend."
2,difficult to understand,"I thought the book came with a cd, but it did not. It was difficult to understand the actual accents from reading the book."
1,Disappointed,"As an actress of color I am appalled at the incompleteness of this book. This book includes accents such as Japanese, Italian, Brooklynese, and German, but neglects to include Spanish, Indian, or any form of Regional African American dialects. This book needs to be updated."
4,A very nice gift...,"...for someone like my mother-in-law, who is mad about daschunds! I really liked the sleek simplicity of this brooch - small but striking. I thought the price was reasonable and communication was good. I would definitely use this seller again."
2,Welcome To Fred,It is not the type of book I enjoy. The author has my same last maiden name is the reason I thought I should try it. Welcome to Fred was not for me.
3,Young Adult literature,"I read this book with my book club, it was interesting. But I found it would be a much better book for young adult readers than adults. Our club was split on enjoying the family situations and wondering what the point of the story was."
4,welcome to Fred,The book held my interest with the amusing manner in which the author expressed himself. It was very easy to imagine yourself watching some of the antics of the book. I was somewhat puzzled by the way the book started and never returned for closure.
3,Welcome to Fred,Interesting but was surprised that it ended at 69% and then the next bookstarted which I haven't read yet.
3,Going to get this book,"I saw this on the free/inexpensive books for the Kindle. I will give it a read and review it. But the jacket cover is all wrong! It shows what seems to be West Texas. I know Fred, Texas. It is in the Piney Woods of East Texas. As a matter of fact my husband and I moved to Texas in 1982 to take care of his elderly relatives. We lived in, as my husband called it, the Fred/Spurger metroplex. If you blinked, you would miss Fred. If you blinked again, you would miss Spurger. Fred was over the county line and a wet county. We lived outside of Spurger, in the dry county.Oh yes, I guess I should not be surprised. The cover was probably done by some ""Yankee"". My husband reminded me of the movie ""Urban Cowboy"". The character played by John Travolta was from Spurger. And there was a scene of him driving around Spurger and showed rows and rows of farmland. Spurger is mostly pine trees. Logging is what happens in East Texas."
2,Welcome to Fred,This book started out slow and continued slow and elementary for me. I read over halp of it and could never get in to it.
4,welcome to fred,"the story for better as I read along, reminding me of family memories if my own. I would recommend this book to others."
5,Enjoyed it - will recommend to my teenage boy,"I thought the main character was a likeable person and really enjoyed his interactions with other children. I also thought the adults were well portrayed; they were not one dimensional or shallow. A relatively strong Christian motif with themes of redemption, as would be expected from a story about a preacher's son. However, the series as a whole allows Mark to diverge from his father's practice and understanding of God while still discovering a faithful life."
1,welcome to fred,"I really didn't like this book, it just didn't hold my attention and I didn't like the people in it."
1,Boring....,I thought from the reviews that I would love this book. I made it through about 3 chapters and couldn't go any further. I hope it got better. I just couldn't find anything to hang on to.
5,A down-to-earth humorous read,"Having lived in Beaumont, Texas, since 1986 - I know where Fred is! I've zoomed through it on a number of occasions on my way to Jasper and we like to stop at their DQ for a cold treat. Mark Cloud, (PK - preacher's kid), suffers normal pre-teen and teenager angst. I enjoyed the ethical events he faces while getting tossed into a really ""back woods"" life and the decisions his father guides him to make on his own. This book is funny, well-written and Whittington has a great style! Even if you have never visited Southeast Texas and the Big Thicket, I know you will be able to relate to the situations Marc gets into. I'm launching into Fred book number 2!"
4,Welcome to Fred review,I enjoyed reading this book on Mark Cloud's adventures growing up in rural East Texas. Funny insightful and well worth the read.
2,Boring Book,"I kept waiting for it to get more interesting. I think that I was about halfway through the book when I quit. I rarely quit reading a book once I start, but this one was really dull. The story went nowhere. I believe that the author was trying to make it a growing up tale of a boy/girl who moved around a lot. There were moments that were engaging (the lady who lived in a cardboard box), but overall not worth the time spent reading."
2,Not a fan,"I couldn't even finish it, and I really wanted to like it. I couldn't get interested in the characters. I didn't laugh, or even smile. I felt brad was trying too hard to be funny, but not original. It is someone's humor...I guess, sorry to say, not my definition of humor."
4,A very nice read,"Enjoyable characters, interesting story line, a story that I think non-Christians and even non-believers would still enjoy. Nothing preachy, rather more questioning and experiencing."
3,Trials of a PK,"Although I enjoyed the book, it was hard to decide whether it was written for the teen audience or for a more mature audience, for the tone seemed to shift during the book. I suppose either audience would appreciate the struggles the young man endures as he tries to adjust to life as a teen, in a frequently changing environment, and as a PK. His trials were often humorous, sometimes tragic, usually painful - but always ""maturing"". Enjoyable reading."
3,Entertaining,Fun story to read but there were way too many words that I had could not understand. Not just a few but at least 3 a page. I am an adult reading it. I bought it for my [...] son but there is no way he could follow the advanced words. I do not recommend this book for the younger generation.
5,Welcome to Fred,"This book was a great read! I could not put it down. Each setting, each character and their thoughts were richly described. The thoughts that we have as kids and teenagers are really pretty funny when you think about it, and this book lets us see the world as Mark Cloud, a preacher's kid growing up in the 1960's, sees it. I laughed 'til tears ran down my face."
2,Didn't get far,I would not say that I hated this book. I did not give chance enough to hate it. I could not get far enough into it to say anything about it other than I made an attempt and deleted it off of my kindle so it did not take up space.
2,Slow start.,"Just couldn't get into it. It took too long to capture my attention. Could be a good book, but it just didn't grab my attention."
2,Welcome to Fred,This book could not hold my interest. I felt it was to immature for me. I did not finish it.
3,Shari Gummi Worms,"I added the gummi worms to my order in order to qualify for super saver shipping, and i was not disappointed in them. However, I ordered the product which contained 12 bags which turns out was way too much for me- I would accidentally eat too much of them without realizing it and would get nauseous. Other than that I was very pleased."
2,Don't buy this book for CGI programming,"I bought this book based on the 5-star reviews - never do THAT again......long on abstract examples that don't mirror the real world, short on logical explanations for the common man(woman).. I have had several other PERL books from the local library that were much better (Castros book is good, don't believe the condescending reviews) - not for the CGI web programmer"
5,theres a killer on the loose!,"This film is pure b-movie entertainment. The plot is filled with holes, and the script leaves itself open to many improvized jokes. Billy, the lead singer for a metal band, takes his lyrics a little bit too seriously and out of nowhere kills 2 people after a recording session. He gets executed for his crimes, claiming innocence throughout the entire trial. 2 years later, the band is reformed with Billys girlfriend as the lead singer, and they set up a big tour. Billy then decides to return from the grave to kill her. I dont wanna give away the 'suprise' ending, but lets just say its 'shocking.' The best part of the movie is the music, which is actually pretty damn good, done by the band Sorcery. I found their website: sorcery.web.com check them out!"
3,Fast forward to the end to see the rock band Sorcery.,"The movie has fair suspense and acting, but the stand out is the rock band Sorcery. They perform three songs at the end of the flick and most of the sound track too."
4,"Very good history, but has some technical issues","This book was published around 1891. It is a pretty good treatment on the folks who helped bring us the telegraph.I did find some inaccuracies though. For instance, the author wrote that the speed of light is 288,000 miles per second. This is, of course, false - it is 288,000 kilometers per second."
3,"Ok, but not great","The book had a lot of interesting thoughts and stories, but it was lacking in accuracy.Ric"
4,Good battery for price,"Bought this battery as a gift for a friend. So far it appears to work great. Overall a good battery for the price. The battery life could be a little longer, but can't complain too much when the purchase price is so low. May get a little longer battery life out of an oem battery, but your going to pay a whole lot more. Would highly recomment."
1,Unanswered Questions,I would sure like to order this product . . . . IF I could only get some answers about its contents. Why doesn't either Amazon or Honey Comb Industries check this website and answer posted questions?
5,Excellent for extra storage,"We use one of these in the office, as well as out in the field.In the office, we use it as a data backup device. No problemsthere. eSata might be a better solution if you are storingdata that you need to access quick/frequently - we use this for emergencybackups in case of data loss on any one of the computers here sofast transfers/access isn't an issue here.Out in the field, we use one of these to transfer customers datafrom old to new computers in the case where there is no network.Zero complaints so far. This drive is quiet, and it works A+ for us."
4,Good product so far...,"It's true that about 20GB of space is taken up right out of the box, which is kind of ridiculous, but if I really needed more space, I would have bought the 500 or 750GB. The hard drive is easily accessible and transfers data quickly via USB2. The unit is very quiet and took no time at all to set up. So far I've been happy with the Seagate320GB and am glad that I chose it."
3,Seagate Freeagent 320GB external drive,"I use this unit mostly to backup my key folders, and my entire disc image in case of disasters. The I/O is relatively fast when burning, and the unit has never had a disc error in 2 years of use. It has no internal software, so you will need your own backup software."
2,Not For The 1st Time Self Learner,"I'm not a student in college. I'm just someone at home with an interest in learning Logic. This was the first book that I've read on the subject and I can say that it was very difficult for me to understand it. Even though I've tried and retried many times. For someone just starting out, and wanting to learn on there own I wouldn't recommend this book. A much better book is ""Crimes Against Logic"" by Whyte."
4,"Very good, essential, compact","This book is a perfect introduction to logic. It is short and goes straight to the point. It features intelligent examples, interesting exercises and a fresh and modern style. It may seem a little too short, but the reader interested in logic is likely to take this book just as an ispiration for buying more complex, specific and comprehensive books on the subject. Some logic dilemmas are left to the reader to interprete, the author just renounces to go in depth in their analysis. This may actually leave a bitter after-taste at the end of each chapter, but it stimulates to further readings in the field of logic and phylosophy of logic."
5,Excellent brief introduction to logic,"This is just the book to whet one's appetite for a deeper engagement in logic. Priest's little book has short, clearly written chapters on validity, truth functions, quantifiers, descriptions, self-reference, modal operators, conditionals, tenses, identity, vagueness, inductive logic, and decision theory. Virtually every chapter shows how interesting philosophical problems arise from or are tied in with logic. The only possible drawback to the book is that new initiates to the philosophical foundations of logic are likely to never again have a good night's sleep after Priest introduces them to some of the classic puzzles."
5,It'll make your brain hurt......but it's a good hurt!,I've never studied logic before so this seemed like a good place to start. I don't know how you could possibly get more information into a little book this size! It's possibly the best value in a book that I've ever seen. If there's anything else to the field of logic that isn't here then I don't want to know. But be prepared to spend some time reading it.....you'll need to keep a notepad handy and you'll definitely need to re-read many sections more than once to get the full understanding. BUT....when done I can guarantee you that you'll be glad you did it. This is an excellent little book and is worth more than $10.
2,Not for me . . .,"To put things in context, while I view myself as a logical person, I find formal logic difficult to follow. (On the other hand, someone who is wired for formal logic may find this book a breeze.)I got this book to help me brush up for my logic final exam at university. Unfortunately, it didn't clarify anything for me, and in fact my text book explains things in a much simplier way. So, even with my prior knowledge (having studied university-level philosophy in the past, just having studied formal logic for a term and reading a text book on the subject), I still thought this book was confusing."
1,Useless and confusing,"I would not recommend this book to anyone. It's difficult to follow for the simple reason that Priest doesn't bother to explain anything. And for that reason, this book is not for a beginner.He also uses symbolic logic throughout the text without any explanations about symbolic logic. The whole book is irritating an difficult to follow.Not recommended."
1,Waste of time,"About the only positive statement I can make about this book is that it has a snappy, small format and a stylish design. Mr. Priest seems to be in a great hurry to end the book; as he brushes and jumps from one topic to another without giving any serious time to explain anything. Most of the concepts presented are quite elementary and anyone with a college degree would be aware of most of what is said.So to sum it up; this is not a text to read if you're attempting to understand logic; and you wont learn anything new if you have read another introductory book on Logic."
2,Who would have thought logic is so boring?,"OK, to be fair, my low rating isn't because this book is bad per say. And I don't mean to discredit or take away from the author, because he surely knows what he's talking about. But I was convinced I would be very interested to learn about logic. I got a few chapters into this book and realized I wasn't. I really, really wasn't. In fact, I find the whole topic dull and even a little silly.So maybe in that sense this is a great book, because as an introduction it showed me I should not be reading about this stuff in the first place. So I'm a little torn, because I would like to rate it higher but I just can't highly rate a book I got no enjoyment out of.So if the author reads this, please don't hate me--it's really not your fault. I'd probably give two stars to the greatest book about accounting, too."
3,just okay...lenses aren't all that,"These glasses will protect your eyes, not bad for close up work, but the lenses aren't that great. Vision gets blurred/warped due to the low quality of the lens, especially when used outside for lawn work. Pay a little more or deal with the quality."
2,wonderful ...... if it worked!!!!,"BOUGHT THIS AND THOUGHT LIFE WAS GOING TO TAKE A TURN FOR HTE BETTER - GREAT DESIGN, BABY LOVED IT. HOWEVER, AFTER HALF AN HOUR IN THE CRIB AFTER THE FIRST NIGHT, IT BROKE. THE LIGHT STAYED ON FOR 4 NIGHTS - WE COULDN'T GET IT TO TURN OFF, EVEN AFTER TURNING THE MACHINE OFF. AND IT JUST KEPT BUZZING. SOO..... GREAT CONCEPT - NOT BABY-PROOF!!!!"
3,Chicco Night Light Soother,"The only complaint I have for this is that it is to sensitive and starts up to easily. It would start up every time my daughter would move, so I don't leave it on during the night."
1,Never Really Worked Well - Now Doesn't Work At All,We purchased this 1 month ago for our baby. It has pretty lights and music and a nice recording options. It is very difficult to attach to the crib. The straps just don't work. It has never really worked consistently and has just quit on us after only 1 month of intermittant use. So disappointing. Do not buy this. There are better options like the fisher price aquarium that work better (literally for years in our case).
4,Night Sounds for sleepless babies,"When you try and find something that will help soothe your infant to sleep there are only a few things they seem to respond to. One, the sound of symphonic music to relax and resassure them. Two, the sound of a heart beat to remind them of a safe place(inside your womb). And thirdly, the sound of a familiar voice like that of a mother or father. Luckily, this toy captures all of the above and does so in a simple and colorful object that fits nicely over a baby's head.My little son absolutely adores this night soother. Before he had trouble settling into the night pattern, but now being seven months, he drifts off to sleep and if he cries in the night, this toy is voice(cry) activated so it goes on automatically to help him drift gently back to sleep without having to get up to comfort him. It has been a lifesaver in our home."
1,Not worth your time or money,"I left a review here already but don't see it. This product came to me brand new I got it from Amazon but shipped by target. I wrote Chicco about it because it is so quiet you had to put your ear to it to hear, well Chicco never responded to me and here I am not even a month later to report that now the soother does NOTHING at all. i have changed the batteries and it does not work. This was a total waste of money and the company yas dreadful customer service. I am totally disapointed."
3,Runs through batteries too quickly!,My daughter loves this toy. She has used it since 12 months old and is now 20 months. She plays with it in her crib until she gets sleepy. BUT we have to change the batteries all the time. And she is able to turn it off and on by herself. I can't imagine how often you would have to change the batteries if you left it on all the time.For this reason alone we are purchasing a different crib toy for baby #2.
3,Limited success,"We got this for our daughter when she was 1 month old. She loves it, and will happily fall asleep watching it. When she wakes in the night, it soothes her back to sleep. HOWEVER, the main reason I chose this over other soothers was the voice record function, and the ads failed to mention that it only records for 20 seconds. That's not even enough time for ""Twinkle, twinkle"" let alone a personalized lullaby."
2,What's that song?,There is a song in this movie that plays right before the library scene (where the gang guys get thrown from the library window)... does anyone know the name of this song and or the group its by?
4,Review of the Sound Track,"For Hip Hop, R&B lovers, this CD is a nice addition to your collection. I had the CD back in 1996, but it was lost. I am buying it again because I have been unable to find anywhere."
1,A WASTE DON'T BUY!!,"I bought this DVD because I didn't want to have to go through the book confused. I thought he would explain things and go through what is covered in the book. WRONG. He goes over some things and not everything in the book. Also he just plays through the scales without even showing examples or giving ideas of how to use or apply them. He even starts going through all these crazy exotic scales for ""who knows what reason"". After going through those scales he then tells you that you will find explanations in my book!! What the hell!!! Is the DVD supposed to be a companion while you go through the book?? He does not teach anything in the DVD, he just wants you to waste your money while he sells his book to you. This DVD sucked!!! I was really looking forward to expand my knowledge."
3,"Strong on branding, weak on selling technology","Mr Pettis does a fine job describing the positioning and branding needs of a high tech company. His advertising comments are somewhat dated by the current tech market space. But he misses the most important point on how to link these messages to actual sales. What we have learned in the dot com fallout is that branding is not revenue, advertising is not revenue, PR is not revenue, revenue is revenue."
2,Synthetic Patches,"These are a synthetic fiber. In my opinion, they do not do half as well as a good cotton patch. They do no handle lubricants or gunk as well as a cotton patch."
3,Years ago Hoppes used to be cloth,"Daryl is most correct, cloth works much better than Hoppes synthetic. Good cloth patches save time and you use less than you would of the synthetic ones.Years ago Hoppes use to be a terry cloth and they worked very well. I still have some I purchased in the 1980's that were from the 1950's I found in a small hardware store with some new old stock cloth patches. I purchased the Hoppes before I knew aboutButch's 3-Inch Square-10,12,16 Gauge Triple Twill Cleaning PatchesThese are the ones I use the most:Butch'S Twill Cleaning Patches (Bag Of 500) (2-1/4-Inch)The Hoppes are cheap in bulk and I now use them to clean the sound tube on Edison Model L M and A cylinder record player sound tubes, the Hoppes work well as you only need to remove dirt and oil. At least they will not go to waste."
3,smelly,The construction of this product was ok but it smelled really strong from either the stain or the wicker itself. I had to send it back as I could not stand it in the house. Vendor was really great about the return and sent a postage paid label so no complaints there.
2,High and dry,"I mounted this compass in my boat and in less than one season it has lost all of it's fluid and is dry as English humor. The compass disk now just bounces around in the unit and I don't know where the heck I'm headed. I'll go get a cheapie next time and if it fails, then I won't have lost so much money."
2,Proper names mispronounced,This is a review of the Blackstone Audio book on tape as read by Grover Gardner.Gardner is an excellent actor and reads the book well enough. However he or his director did LMB the disservice of not checking the pronunciation of the proper names in the book. Throughout the reading he mispronounces several proper names; most egregious Dendarii (per the LMB web site should be den-DARE-ee) as den-dair-ae-eye. These mispronunciations are highly distracting.
3,End of an era,"It is hard to judge Miles, every time I finish reading on of the books in the series. This may be the most complex book in the series (i wouldn't know, I still haven't read them all) but it left me with sad feeling. Felling of ending one generation. Also, i can not understand why Luis keeps putting Miles in a position where he can boss every one around, maybe it's just what keeps Miles attractive but I just do not buy it. I will not reveal spoilers, but the role which he is playing in this book is something more powerfull then his previous roles, he deals very well with it actually. Another thing, from the moment when thing get started You can tell who is to blame for all, You can not miss even for a chance, also I think Ivan (Miles's cousin, I don't know if this is English transcript, i didn't read this book on original language) is little out of character here. All in all, good book with it's flaws. Read it"
4,Miles is amazing.,I think this book is a great continuation of the saga. Perhaps we will finally get away from overly complex schemes and plans and get down to the nitty-gritty of Miles' life: When and Whom will he Marry
5,Strong entry in a terrific series,"This book marks the turning point of Miles Vorkosigan/Naismith's life. Without giving away the plot, there's not much else to say. Miles faces his life, his choices and himself, in prose so brutally honest that it almost hurts to read. But the writing is beautiful, the plot twisty and surprising, and the characters glorious. This is the culmination of all that has gone before, and I strongly recommend that you read what has gone before. prior to dipping into this novel._Memory_ is a fabulous book. It would be well worth reading if it had only the great story, or only the incredibly well-drawn characters, or only the deeper layers of meaning. When you combine all of these, and add in the absolutely sublime prose, you have a fabulous book. Read the precursors, then read this. You won't be sorry."
4,Need the Hardcover,Well I had already read this book as a paperback but am replacing as many of my paperbacks with hardcover as I can find. I really like this author and the series and am awaiting a new book. Chances are there will not be another one but that is a shame. Great book..
5,Memory continues Bujold's reputation for quality.,"By Ed BurkheadMemory brings Miles Vorkosigan to a new crisis, catastrophe, and disaster which makes it an opportunity as good as any he has encountered before.This story stands alone well enough that it could be read before any others in the series. In it, Bujold brings a change of pace that invigorated me. When I bought the hard cover copy, I not only read it quickly, but I re-read it within weeks. Bujold tells of people I would like to have as friends and places I would like to live. In this story she places the people in events that continually catch me by surprise yet remain ""believable.""Bujold packs more characterization, observation, wry humor and pathos in a paragraph than most authors get in a page. While she does that, she keeps the book light and fun to read.Are you getting the idea I'm trying to recommend this book without taking away any of the surprises? Do, please, get that idea."
5,Read Me!,"These books should definitely be read in order. The list is below. Lois is someone in whom you should have faith; there are sci-fi topics I avoid, having seen them done wrong too many times. She uses them... and makes me feel ashamed for doubting that the book would be anything but perfect.Shards of HonorBarayar(these two books are also combined into ""Cordelia's Honor"")The Warrior's ApprenticeShort Story: The Mountains of Mourning(all short stories are contained in ""Borders of Infinity"")The Vor GameCetagandaEthan of AthosShort Story: LabyrinthShort Story: The Borders of InfinityBrothers in ArmsThe Borders of InfinityMirror DanceMemoryKomarrA Civil CampaignDiplomatic Immunity"
5,Best version of the book made into a movie,"I've wanted a copy of this version of the Dumas book, ever since I saw it on TV. I've seen all the versions and I think this is the best. Unfortunately, I've never found a DVD copy from the US. There are Korean, Spanish, and even a Chinese version which will play on US DVD's...however they scare me. So, I ordered this used VHS copy so I can at least see the movie. The quality of the VHS was very good and better than described by the supplier."
2,Sadly flat.,"Perhaps I was unfairly influenced by having already seen the 1998 French adaptation, staring,Gérard Depardieu (which is closest to the book), and the 2002 movie, which stars, James Caviezel as Edmond Dantès, and Guy Pearce as Fernand Mondego. The 2002 movie, though taking many liberties with the story stayed, exciting and fun through-out. This 1975 version is just dull. Perhaps there was a better movie in there, somewhere, before the inevitable made for television cuts, but there is no way to tell."
1,In different language,"Well, it's for anyone who can read or hear German. There is no English language or subtitled for English so I send it back for refund."
1,Crucial cuts make a mess,"After waiting for some time for this to be issued on tape, my disapointment knows no bounds.I give the VHS version of this otherwise excellent production only 1 star as the deletions from the original broadcast make the story illogical and hard to follow. Missing is the complete ""tableaux"" scene which makes the confrontation between Dantes and Fernand Mondego and the subsequent duel with Albert Mondego understandable. One wonders about the studio's choice of editor for this VHS release. Hope they corrected the omissions in the DVD version."
3,A great movie,I disagree with many of the other reviews that are posted here. I adventure in the movie may appear dull compared to the pageturner but when the movie itself is evaluated alone I believe that the movie is excellent. Although the movie did leave out many aspects that seemed important in the book the time I enjoyed the time I spent watching the movie. I especially like the interperation that Albert should have been the son of Dantes and Mercedes. The character of Dantes and Mercedes were well played. The parting sceen of Dantes and Mercedes was truly thouching.
2,Cut verison of a fine miniseries,"When I first saw the Count of Monte Cristo it was presented in the TV mini-series format, which provided more depth to the performances of the actors. And followed the sequence of this classic very closely. Giving great drama to the trails of Edmond. From arrest, to years in prison, escape, obtaining the treasure of Monte Cristo, and finally revenge. But this beautiful mini-series was cut fron a multi hour sensation, into as poor imatation of the original work. If the original mini-series was to be released, I beleive you to be greatly entertained. But of the Movie version is to be released, you will find dis-jointed scenes and a story that many times is hard to follow because the essence of this story was left on the edditing room floor."
2,Fits the stereotype,"The Count of Monte Cristo is by far the best piece of literature in my collection, yet when I saw this movie I was greatly disappointed. The director failed to direct Chamberlain into the intensity and the morality of Dantes and the lack of equally important details of the book were left out due to reasons not understandable to me. This movie fits the stereotype: the book was (WAY) better than the movie. Instead of spending 3 hours with this bad adaptation of a masterpiece, why not read the book and get a lot more experience and depth out of it?"
2,Monte Cristo,"Although this version follows the book more closely than the newer version, I felt it lacked the excitement. It was a little too slow for my taste. But again, to all who have read the Count of Monte Cristo, this one is more closely matched to the book."
2,Richard Chamberlain is a horrid choice for the role!,"First of all, to anyone who has read the book and knows what Monte Cristo is supposed to look like...well, let's just say that Chamberlain, although very handsome, does not look like Monte Cristo at all. Monte Cristo also has more duality and sensitivity than Chamberlain depicted. If you want a taste of the REAL Monte Cristo, see the 1955 French version, where the incomparable Jean Marais plays the Count. He is the one and only Monte Cristo."
1,DONT BUY THIS!!!!,"Maybe the worst investment of 15 dollars EVER! utterly pathetic what they due to Demas classic, its a shame Chamberlain got handed this scipt!!!!"
4,A Story With A Strong Moral Lesson,"THE COUNT OF MONTE CHRISTO is a film adaptation of the classic story by Alexandre Dumas of three men who conspire to have their common enemy Edmund Dantes sent to prison and the vengeance wreaked by Dantes after his escape many years later. The movie is reasonably faithful to the book. The early part of the film depicts prison life graphically and the mood changes abruptly for the better with the start of the revenge sequence.Richard Chaberlain gives a good performance and is believable as both the younger and older Edmund Dantes. A strong supporting cast includes Kate Nelligan, Louis Jourdan, Donald Pleasance and Tony Curtis. David Greene is known for his direction of GRAY LADY DOWN and THE STRANGE AFFAIR."
3,Ok Toy,"My son was excited to get the bug house. The clear cover is a magnifying glass type of plastic but slides out of the house too easily. I'm frequently putting it back in and it will be easy for bugs to escape when the cover slides open during transport. For what I got, it was a little pricey for me. Shop around"
4,it works....,"When it first came out from the package, I was a little worried. It didn't look like a quality converter. But when I brought it along when traveling overseas, it worked fine all the way."
1,"Junk, blew out the third time I used it.","Nice set of adapter plugs, but the transformer is a piece of crap. Blew out at 2 in the morning taking the breaker with it in a whiff of ozone. Thought it had taken out my cpap too. Woke the landlord and got everything reset. Pretty exciting way to spend your first night in London. Found out the CPAP is auto switching and didn't need the transformer anyway. Caveat emptor."
1,Just didn't work at all,This converter/adapter kit was a total waste of money. Would not stay in the plugs in Rwanda.....:( Fortunately a traveling companion had a set of adapters like I had sitting at home....they fit and worked very well.
5,Love this item!,"I love this paper. It really, really does come out good. I love the printer that I am using with this paper and everything about it. I have never had a problem running out of ink before paper, and I have never had a problem with the paper getting ""stuck"" or anything. I know some people are stuck on the price, but as far as I'm concerned, it is worth it. When I think of the money I have put in printer ink and toner before I got this pack with it included, I could cry. When looking at the price, just remember you get what you pay for.Margaret"
3,"paper of good quality, price a bit high","The pictures turn out very nice, with vibrant colors. The ink cartridge does empty before I get the chance to print the last 5 to 10 pictures in the set. Also, the colors turn out matte if I try printing while the low ink message is displayed. The price per picture may not be far from the amount charged when printing in a store.Despite all the drawbacks however, I would still recommend this product and the printer it is used for, because they offer the advantage of allowing you to print good quality pictures at one's own convenience-provided there's ink in the cartridge."
4,Epson PictureMate,The Epson system is very simple to use and produces sharp 4 X 6 prints with fine color reproduction.Sometimes you get lines across the printor even no picture at all.This is due to a dirty surface.It is easy to clean although uses some ink.Each ink refill lasts a long time.I bought mine for $99 and regard as very good value for money
1,very disappointed,Pleased witht the quality of the print however I only got 56 prints off the cartridge.
4,Picture Perfect,"I first saw this printer in action at my daughter's house while visiting over the Thanksgiving holiday. She being a techie whipped it out of the box, loaded it with paper, and began printing. It seemed easy to me (a non-techie), so upon arriving home in California,I ordered it,too. It was as easy to set up and I was printing as well as editing pictures minutes out of the box. The color is true and I was able to handle the prints, smudge free, as soon as they left the printer. My only concern is that the cartridge that came with the printer has not lasted as long as I thought it would - maybe the company doesn't put a full cartridge in to begin with? I have a new cartridge ready to go, so will test my theory soon.BC in California"
1,Ink Does Not Last for 150 Pics!,"If you want to pay $1.50 a picture this is the printer for you. We have never gotten more than 35 pics from a print pack. We have used them before the ""6 month"" expiration date, but the print cartridge goes dry and/or jets clog in between usage. We have to clean jets 5 or 6 times if we don't print again within a couple weeks. This has happened twice. The first time we returned to Epson and that was a pain in the rear - they sent us a check for 35 cents for 116 unused pictures. They did eventually send us the full refund. If you have 150 pictures to print all in the same day - within 30 minutes of installing - it might work."
3,Epson Printpack T5846,Product failed after 50 pictures when it was supposed to print 150 pictures. Cartridge was outr of ink.
5,What is looking good worth to you?,"Expensive per print, perhaps. I have an excuse: grandchildren. These photos go into their albums. Pictures of times they won't remember. I want to look reasonably good in my pictures with them. I have ordered less expensive photos online from various places and I have been disappointed by the colors. Who wants to be remembered looking sallow as well as wrinkled? I can almost always get a better result from these print packs and printing from inside Photoshop or just Elements. The colors are great and the paper feels heavier and more expensive. As often as I order online, I still miss ordering the exact print a family member might want. These packs are easy to load, no anxiety when changing the cartridge. No funny colors on my hands."
3,Excellent prints but ALWAYS RUNS PUT OF INK before paper,"This is the THIRD pack I've used. I read the disclaimer that I should use the inkpack within 6 months. Well, the first pack, I had 30 sheets left. The second pack, I had 50+ sheets left and THIS last pack, I had 88 sheets left. That's more than half.And Epson doesn't allow you to buy the print pack without the paper.Overall, I feel compelled to try to off-label companies. You are paying a lot of money $35-40 a pack for about 70-80 prints. That's 50 cents a print."
4,Great Product,Pictures come out just as if you'd sent them or taken them into a 1 hour photo if not better. My only complaint is the ink seems to run out before the picture paper does.
5,Epson T5846 Picturemate print pack,I have bought 4 seperate packs and plan on buying more. Produces great photos. Very happy with the results! The ink cartridge is very easy to load and replace.
1,Product Not NEW,"This product did not arrive new. It came with refilled ink. The Epson photo cartridges have ink that is archival and fade resistant. I can't be sure that the ink that was refilled in this cartridge was the quality of the ink that Epson uses. I was VERY disappointed. There was no time to return as my family was just about to leave on a vacation where we were taking the printer (and cartridge) to a family memeber's house. We had many pictures to print, and we had to use the faulty cartridge."
3,good but not super...,I tried out the product and the overall quality is average compared to HP ink and paper.
4,Plan to print about 1/3 as many photos,"Yes, the color and quality of the prints are great, but the ink will NOT last to give you 150 photos. Assuming you start with a perfectly clean set of jets, if you print some and then don't print for a couple of weeks you will have to clean the jets--probably multiple times--before the prints look good again. I guess they get clogged from sitting. That process takes up a ton of ink. I don't even know if you could get a hundred prints out of this if you printed non-stop, but I can tell you that you will probably get more like 50 or 60 prints if you need to clean the jets between printing sessions. That's uncool. They really need to sell the cartridges without paper so one has an option--otherwise the paper is wasted."
3,"great print quality, poor quantity","The photos that are printed via the Epson Picture Mate print pack are great, but I have yet to get all 150 photo papers to be used up by the ink. In fact, I think the most I have gotten out of a print pack was 80. Fortunately, Epson offers a money-back policy where if you send back the unused photo papers, they will refund the difference. Hopefully they will improve this product sometime soon."
2,"Prints look great, but ink only lasted for about 1/3 of the paper supplied","The prints I got with this from my Picturemate charm looked great, but the ink is a joke. It only lasted for about 60 of my 150 sheets of paper. I was printing sepia toned images, so I suspect that has something to do with it. Don't rely on the ink that comes with this product, always have at least two back up ink cartridges."
5,Great product for price.,Love the Epson printer and being able to get the ink and photo paper in same package for a good price.
1,not the best,I had problems using this product at one point. The pictures turned out very bad. From now on I will purchase this product at my local Office Depot.
2,mixed bag,"Excellent picture quality, but ink expires long before you get to 150 prints. Also, the second ink cartridge was defective!!!!Tough item to assess."
3,Okay read,"Got this for a class in computer ethics. Some of the essays are boring, others frustrating, but some are good reads"
2,Display is extremely hard to read.,"Display is EXTREMELY hard to read. My son wanted me to play this with him, but it's very hard to answer questions if you don't even know what you're trying to answer."
3,Interesting information but...,"If you are a reader of CIO Magazine or any other technical leader publication or web site, this book will seem very familiar to you.There also seems to be a lot of filler. It's full of the tricks that college students use when writing papers - use lots of graphics, use a lot of quotes from sources, and make the font large.If you don't frequent the usual technical/business sites, this is a worthwhile read."
4,Valuable information for IT professionals interested in their career,"A must read for every IT professional looking to reach the top. The chapters on ""What Executive Recruiters Are Looking For"" and ""Building the Right Network"" are invaluable. I would also highly recommend it to CXOs looking to hire a CIO or set their CIO's agenda."
5,New Fabulism,"The Crimsom Bears books, which I found in a used bookstore, in all their small press publication glory, are the best I've read in years. I've also read Zuntig, a sort of sequel to these books. LaFarge is one of my new favorite writers."
5,AMAZING!,THIS IS THE MOST INTRIGUING BOOK EVER! IT IS WRITTEN WITH SUCH BEAUTIFUL LANGUAGE IT MAKES ME WANT TO CRY! YES! LAFARGE IS GOOD.. OH YES.. LARGE IS GOOD!
4,Be prepared to recommend this book.,"This book was given to me as a gift. I already bought two copies and gave them as gifts to others. Anyone who enjoys theater and the backstage ""goings on"" will enjoy reading this book. Another recommended book is: The See-saw Log a Chronicle of the Stage Production by William Gibson. It is the daily diary of trying to get the play/movie Two for the SeeSaw produced."
3,Christian sects pre-1890,"The Teachings, Discipline, Customs, and Manners of Administering the Sacraments among The Abyssinians, Anglicans, Armenians, Baptists, Catholics, Congregationalists, Copts, Episcopalians, Greeks, Jacobites, Lutherans, Maronites, Methodists, Nestorians, Presbyterians, Protestants, The Syrians, etc., etc., With the differences between the various Christian denominations clearly explained for the people; The belief of the Early Christians, The changes of Discipline, and the abuses condemned in different centuries: with the Traditions of all Christian Peoples relating to these Holy Rites. Superbly Illustrated so as to show the Rules and Ceremonies of Each Christian Church. by Rev Jas. L. Meagher: Russell Brothers, Seventh edition. 1892. Contents include, Baptism, Confirmation, Eucharist, Penance, Extreme Unction, Holy Orders, Matrimony, and more. A most interesting read for those interested in this subject matter. 472 pages including index."
2,Picnic Time Cellar Insulated Six Bottle Wine Tote,The zipper arrived broken form one of the two Tote bag I purchased !!!The rest of the bag works pretty fine
1,Bad service,I ordered my product from Kegworks on 12/7. I quickly received a confirmation e-mail. My order did not ship till 12/14 and only after I called customer service to inquire why I hadn't received my package. The customer service members were clueless and not very helpful. I will never order from this company ever again
2,the strap broke on first use!,The strap broke the first time i used it. I only had 4 bottles of wine in it (it is supposed to transport 6) Everything else is fine but shoddy craftmanship on the strap!!
2,Weak handles that break.,"Loved this wine carrier at first, but after only 3 weeks, the handles on the top broke right off. Would not recommend this product. Not happy with purchase."
3,So I took a gamble,"I'm giving this three stars generously.. It works, and well. but when i received the thrower.. it looked like it went flying out of an ATV going 40. it was banged up. i tried cleaning it as best as i could because Christmas was so close. The shipping box was brand new so it wasn't damaged during shipping but as soon as i opened the box.. i was so upset. there was marks all over the thing. and it was taped to a piece of cardboard. terrible. But it does work really good. Just sucks that it had to look like garbage."
1,Utter Rubbish,"Nothing on the packaging indicates that these are later re-recordings, not originals. Half are live recordings with all the quality of a cell phone recording, the other are redone by some old guy who may or may not be Glen Campbell."
2,Be aware these are live versions!,Nothing on the CD itself indicates the songs are anything but the original recordings. I was very dissapointed to discover every song is a live version. Not happy at all with the purchase; will be adding it to my garage sale pile this summer.
2,could be better,I had this album years ago and I loved it. It got ruined and I took this opprutinity to replace it. Most of the songs were good but some of them weren't exactly the way I remembered them. If I were going to buy it again..I wouldn't
4,"Good, but could use a few more songs from ""He's the DJ, I'm the rapper.""","Let's be honest, if you're looking at this product, you're already bought in.I thought I'd buy this as I really don't care for any side B material from ""He's the DJ, I'm the Rapper"" but wanted some highlights from that and the other songs seemed ok too. I guess my recommendation would be to pick these songs out one by one. If you don't know the song, it's probably one of the iffy ones.Amazon has done a great job of having all their songs available, so just dump the extra couple bucks to buy a truly ""Greatest Hits"" of your own. I'd also highly recommend getting the ""full"" version of ""Fresh Prince of Bel-Aire."" If you haven't heard it, it will blow your mind. How I went ~ 15 years without knowing there were extra verses is beyond me."
5,"Not a watch, rather a time piece","This is not a damn watch, that is a time piece. I love it so much. I would not give this watch for a rolex"
2,Disappointed- Epson T5845 Print Pack.,"My review is two fold. I like the quality of the photos from my picturemate. However I've ordered the T5845 cartridge twice, both times I only was able to print 50 photos no where near the 100 advertised. That over $.60 per photo."
5,Cheaper than local; nice quality pictures from this product,"I bought this through Amazon for my *old* PictureMate Pal printer, and it was much cheaper than buying it locally. The cartridge fit perfectly, and the pictures were clear and with vibrant colors. Used it for our homemade photobooth for our wedding."
1,PictureMate T5845-M,"100 pictures, I think not!I printed maybe 15 pictures before it told me your print pack is low and needs replacing!Horrible product and would not recommend."
2,Careful.... had 2 faulty packs in a row,"I have 4 of these printers that I use for special events at the church. I bought 4 packs of ink for Halloween and one of them gave me the low ink notice after only printing about 10 of the auto nozzle clean prints.I thought it might be a fluke, so I just let it print until it ran out, which was about 20 prints later.I threw that cartridge away.This weekend, I bought 6 print packs and 1 of them did did the same thing. Reported low-ink after only printing the Auto Nozzle prints.I haven't printed any prints from the cartridge, I ejected it and put it back in the box.$33 is a lot to spend to only get 20-30 prints out of a cartridge."
3,"Great picture quality, but...",We just love the photos we can print at home now but the ink always runs out way before the paper does. Epson needs to have an option of just buying the ink cartridge at a cheaper price so we can get rid of all this extra photo paper!!
4,Nice paper,Nice paper with matte finish that helps hide fingerprints! I do prefer the glossy finish a bit more as it makes the photos look just a bit crisper.
2,My Thoughts,"As a pilot working on my instrument license, I found this video of little or no value. It wasn't any different than other cheesy aviation videos I've seen, so I wouldn't recommend it to student instrument pilots."
3,Not exactly the best quality but it works,"I bought this valance to go in my son's nursery and it's cute but it's not the best quality. The length from top to bottom is not that long at all, it looks like it was made too short. Also, there is no lining it's just a few pieces of fabric. It was made very cheaply. The only reason that I am keeping it, is because the colors match the bedding set we put in the nursery. I might order another one just to add more depth to it, up to our window. I know to order another curtain sounds ludacris when this is not a rave review - but have you ever heard just going with what you have and making it work. That's pretty much where I am with it considering the fact that our little guy will be here in just a few short weeks, just want to check certain things off of my list."
4,King Diamond - The Graveyard,"This was my first non 80's album of King Diamond and I was amazed just how good it was. It has a real cool story to it and it is by far some of King's most darkest work ever. Andy La Rocque does another amazing job on guitars. If you listen to when ""Black Hill Sanitarium"" kicks in you can here the Halloween theme to those Michael Myers horror movies being played. I thought that was very cool. My favorite song on the album is definetly ""Heads On The Wall"". Like I said this is definetly King's most darkest album. I still like his 80's stuff like ""Them"" and ""Abigail"" better than this but for an album released in 1996 I was shocked how awesome it still was. It definetly marks #3 on my top 3 favorite King Diamond albums. It is worth it for any King Diamond fan.... LUCY FOREVER"
4,Great album,"This is a great album by the king of metal. If you're into newer King Diamond, this is definately worth buying. The King has amazing vocals, but it has been said that they can get on your nerves. I personally can't get enough of Diamond. King Diamond is, and always will be the king of metal, and this album, Graveyard, only supports that fact."
5,A definite must in any King Diamond collection.,This is the best cd that King Diamond has put out yet. Songs guaranteed to be classics such as Heads on the Wall and I'm not a stranger. This is a cd that every metal fan should own and cherish. Long live the King.
4,"Great, but takes several listenings to appreciate","This is a fairly rough album, and the whole is by far better than the sum of its parts. None of the songs stands particularly well on its own, so you have to listen to the whole thing to truly enjoy it. The flow of the story, as well as the song structure, is typical King. The story is horribly dark and disturbing, and I stayed away because I originally thought it was a tribute to child abuse. Reading an interview with King changed my mind: it's really about a man who is falsely accused of child abuse, and his suffering then revenge. This is King's standard theme. If you read the lyrics, make sure to read ALL of them, as the story has a few twists. Once I got past the lyrics, and listened several times (which I always have to do with King albums), this album grew on me and is probably my third favorite. Don't buy this as your first King album, as Them plus Conspiracy or Abigail plus Abigail 2 are better. If you're a King fan, buy it and enjoy."
3,"""I will be your misery....""","After ""The Spider's Lullaby"", ""The Graveyard"" is a little better, going back to the traditional epic album. ""The Graveyard"" might be King's most socially aware album ever. Presenting us with a story about a father who has molested his daughter, and has blamed it on the wrong man. Some of the lines are little silly, but musically it's head and shoulders above ""Spider""(not to say that I didn't enjoy ""Spider..""). Songs like ""Black Hill Santitarium"", ""Waiting"", ""Heads on the Wall"", ""Digging Graves"", ""Sleep Tight Little Baby"" and ""Lucy Forever"" really stand out. Some unusual keyboards touches can be heard in ""I Am"". Just like a lot of Diamond stories and characters, there really isn't any good guys. Even the main character that King plays isn't the hero. And at the end, the conflict isn't resolved, and the door is open for a sequel. Biggest complaint: Herb Simonsen does not complient Andy laRocque well at all..."
4,Where did this come from?,"Good question, I have no idea... most ""Greatest Hits"" come from bands anyone could name... (Hed) doesn't fall in there. The album is ""alright"" a must have for (Hed) fans, but most of us had these songs from the other albums...nothing was new. In general it helps you not have to change cd's... if you don't know them it is a great way to get a taste without having to buy all the cd's!"
1,outdated opinions not qualitative research based info,"This book was required reading for my class and I found it to be lacking in scientific backing. Where does the information come from? Poorly written and just as disappointing was the editing. The information was not helpful to me and frankly, I'm not certain I believe the author is qualified to write this level of text."
5,"Echo of ""Best Bluesman You Never Heard Of""...","I certainly agree with the gentleman above. I have owned this album since shortly after it came out, and if it weren't digital, it'd be worn out. Yes, it's The Bluebirds, but mostly it's Buddy Flett. Both Bluebirds albums are wonderful examples of the bayou/blues/boogie/swamp/louisiana rock ""genre"".Though Dust My Broom is obviously not Mr. Flett's creation, and to some degree it's become a chestnut in the field, I listen as often as I can to his version here. (If you happened to hear him play it in Shreveport at the benefit concert KWS created for him a few months back, you also might well up from the first few notes.)Now that we can preview songs themselves these days, don't listen to me, or us. Go play the clips. I sure find these renditions wear very very well even for being a decade plus ""old"".I also recommend moving heaven and earth to hear Buddy Flett live. Here in mid-2008, he seems to be touring with Hubert Sumlin and Kenny Wayne Shepherd a lot."
4,Let's get Physical!,"I was ""Carried Away"" by the power of this CD. Great music. My personal favorites include ""Physical"", ""Silvery Rain"", ""Falling"", ""Recovery"", and the touching dolphin song, ""The Promise."" If you enjoy Olivia, then you will most likely love this CD too!"
2,Major Compromise,"It seems that ONJ feels she has to get something commercial out there to get attention for what she seems to really believe in. ""Physical"" although it was her #1 selling single of all time is such a commercial song. The pictures in the album are inane. The rest of the tracks like Landslide and Strangers Touch are just as commercial. Then you get finally to Silvery Rain and realize that there is a deep message to the song and its cleverly written and well sung. And then The Promise which is a gorgeous song about Dolphins and I am a fellow Dolphin lover. So, I give it 2 stars for these 2 songs. The rest of it belongs to the masses of people.... These 2 songs save the album. Recovery is also good due to the harmonies and lyrics."
3,Book has some very definite strengths.,"Historical amusement about the Maximillian episode in Mexico. The book is serious about the history, viewing the times primarily from the point of view of three characters: an officer, and an official on the royalist side, and the Empress Charlotte herself. The depiction of the urban fighting was particularly good. It was also very good in depicting a time when fighters could show localized bravery, yet not have a deep commitment to the general cause for which they were fighting (cf Afghanistan and switching of sides). The narrator is a German officer in World War I who has fictional encounters with the Empress Charlotte, still alive, and is given the diary of the Mexican officer. The German officer's character is well drawn. The book is marred by Farcau's attempt to develop colorful characters and exciting plot details, both of which ultimately fall flat."
2,"good reading, i think....","I don't claim to be an expert, but I've been reading many books like this one & I found several things stated in this book that are contradictory to ALL other authors that I've read so far. In the interest of brevity I'll mention one example: they state ""Bristle Worms are your friend"". Is this true? No other book I've read yet would agree with that. If you visit saltwater supply web sites many of them sell Bristle Worm traps and make statements like ""get those pests before they get your prized specimens"". Who's right? If you read this book be positively sure you read some others and decide for yourself."
2,Freud FT3000,"I purchased the Freud FT3000 from Amazon, it came to the house no damage and wonderfully packed. This router was intended to be used in a router table and I must say that it is well suited for the task. Above table bit change with the help of a above the table spindle lock Mechanism. However the height ajustment seemed kind of clunky and when the router was bottomed out to change the blade above the table it seemed to bind. The last time I raised the router to change the blade it bound so tight it would not release. For fear of breaking it and the fact the router is now a table weight, I am sending it back for an exchange. I like this router allot and for what it is intended to do it is great. I have sence read that the height ajustment seems to be a quality control issue. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that the next one does not have this problem."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ROUTER!,"I had this router for about a year and a half and it saw very little use, but seemed to work well. However, the router started to heat the bits up so hot they couldn't be touched. The router was sent in to Freud for repair. They replaced the armature and a bearing...received it back and the problem is not corrected. I called Freud and the repair person shrugged it off trying to tell me its normal for the router bits, collet and shaft to heat up beyond the point of being able to touch it. He said sorry and rudely hung up. I own Porter Cable, Milwaukee and Craftsman routers and they don't do this. In fact, the Freud didn't until recently. I guess I have no recourse, but to buy a different router. However, it will deinitely be from a company other than Freud!"
4,difference between movie and real life,"a swedish middle school student was seduced by his teacher and start a love affair. when the affair ended, the teacher was being rather nasty. but it didn't matter because the war started. the student's older brother died in a u-boat.for a movie, the subject is rather great. but if it were in real life, it would've been another scandal in the news..."
3,fun game,"this game is fun & the graphics are nice but the lighting on the game is too dark, i will buy a different one, maybe madden."
5,blitz hell yeah,blitz i like alot better then madden easyer to play i think there a little action to the game then madden but madden has its own good reveiw too but its just me i like blitz better
3,"Rich for ideas, poor for effective solutions","The article gathered here are essentially alexandrian like papers, where general ideas and goals appears clearly, but expressed in a very textual way. So, there is not a lot of stuff on effective design patterns. Hopefully there is some (and even good ones), but it's not obvious that it justify the book size. If you are rather new to patterns (you've just read the ""Design pattern"" and / or ""Pattern oriented software architecture""), consider first the third volume. If you like it, then consider to buy this one. If you REALLY REALLY like it, then consider to buy the first volume"
5,Excellent Book,"This is an excellent book for anyone interested in a spiritual path or thinking about the death of a loved one. It is a good overview of Buddhist teachings, but if one is interested in learning more, I recommend Gelek Rinpoche's transcript in book form called Odyssey To Freedom."
5,"Incredible knowledge, USE it.","I am a third generation farmer and have been using Dr. Andersen's knowledgefor three years. I am amazed at the increase in quality and quanity ofmy crops, with less costly and poisonous inputs.Please, read this book and gain a new look on life, food and ourplace in this world."
5,Land minding,"Again, like the previous book a must for looking after the land and looking outside the chemical square."
5,love it,"It was very easy to assemble. I couldn't ask for a better tricycle. My little one loves it!***update***It is now 2012, so we've had this trike for 5 years. It's been through 4 kids and has one more kid to go. This tricycle still looks and works like it's brand new! Kettler is awesome and worth the money!"
3,Da sTorM,"Like most BCC joints this follows in the dark beats and in ya face raps. However, this LP as a whole just wasn't that great. There are classic hits & ill lines from Starang & company but some songs you feel like skippin. 3.5 stars would be a better rating."
3,Gunn Clappaz...need better Gunnz.,"O.G.C (Starang Wondah, Top Dog & Louisville Sluggah), debut in 1996 with ""Da Storm"". It's a decent album, but should have been much better. Of the four debut albums from the B.C.C (Enta Da Stage, Black Moon. Dah Shinin', Smif-N-Wessun. & Nocturnal, Heltah Skeltah) Da Storm is clearly the worst of the four. It seems like Da Beatminerz (Producers of the album) saved all their best sh*t for the other three groups and O.G.C got the scraps. This was also the last LP of the four to be released, but also nothing was really expected from this trio.On the plus side, this album contains two of my all-time favorite B.C.C tracks: No Fear and Gunn Clapp (both are REDICULOUS, get them any way you can!) And Starang and Louisville are two excellent MC's. But this album just doesn't have the same punch & rawness that the other three posess.Bottom Line: Get it, it's worth the money. 3 stars. Peace."
2,not impressed,"it's the same old boot camp stuff...no growth. maybe my expectations are too high. i am a boot camp fan, but this? i played this twice when i first bought it (back in 1996) and it is now collecting dust on my cd rack."
4,Semi Ol' School ROCKS,"This was one of my favorite albums from members of one of the most lyrically prolific groups in the rap game: Boot Camp Clik. Let me write that word again: LYRICS. Top Dog, Louieville Sluggah, and Starang Wondah offer some tight lyrics throughout, with guest appearances by several BCC crew members. This album will not dissapoint the hiphop enthusiast that is not programmed into thinking that today's ""rap and R&B"" is the formula for a ""good"" album."
3,OK.,"O.G.C. sound like a junior version of Smif n wessun or heltah skeltah, who need to do some growing up. This album has some great beatminerz beats and a good overall mood (I like the whole ""storm"" thing), and Starang Wondah is one of the BCC's best rappers, but anyone who says the other two members of the group, Louieville Sluggah and Top Dog, are good rappers needs to clean out their ears. These guys are mediocre. At least they keep it hardcore, though, and this album was the last from the BCC before they switched to their crappy new R&B sound. With some matured rapping skills and better arrangement of the tracks (too many skits and mini-songs on the first half of the album), this could've been another ""dah shinin"" or ""nocturnal"". I'm waiting to see if they can improve for their 2nd album."
3,O.G.C. are the tightest trio out of N.Y. in a long time,"O.G.C. are the tightest trio out of N.Y. in a long time; the joint is Blazing w/lyrical pyromania! The best tracks on the this album are done mostly by the beatminers with two outstanding exceptions E-Swift, and Buckshot w/ Lord Jamar both shine as well on their repective tracks. the real power of the album comes from the three m.c.'s ability to meld into tracks seamlessly as well as carry the load on their own. O.G.C. showed with this album they have what it takes to bring the thundersound to the underground, I hope the sophmore jinx that has affected some of the B.C.C.'s other artist doesn't repeat itself on the follow up effort to Da Storm. The fab five of bucktown are always a lock on any mixtape in America on this album O.G.C. definitely show why. This album has been out for about a year now and its still mostly slept on by heads out there. Da Storm is a must have for any hip-hop fans collection."
4,The perfect soundtrack for a rainy Brooklyn day...,"If it were rainin' in Brooklyn, and everything got quiet, if you listened reeeeal carefully, you might just hear the strains of ""Da Storm"" blowing in the wind. This really is a concept album in that all of the songs (produced with beautiful accuracy by Da Beatminerz) truly do evoke a rainy-day type of mentality. And that is to make no mention of the Gunn Clappaz themselves. Starang, Top Dog and Louieville Sluggah are among the most accomplished MCs in the Bootcamp Clik. Although Starang is most definitely head-and-sholders above the other two, they hold it down with more conviction than the average rapper in this industry. Highlights include the muffled-but-thumpin' ""No Fear,"" the record-industry indictment ""Gunn Clapp"" and the Starang solo, aptly entitled ""Hurricane Starang."" This is yet another great album from the Bootcamp Clik, thanks to Da Beatminerz deep-yet-simple production and real MCing. But it's not for everyone. Real hip-hop never is..."
5,DA STORM IZ DA BOMB!!!,"This is da best Boot Camp based joint out there (along with da classic Black Moon cd, ""Enta Da Stage""). This album is so slammin'!! Every real head into East Coast rap should listen to this album!! O.G.C & da whole Boot Camp Click is HOT!!!! Also check out ""Heltah Skeltah - Nocturnal"", ""Smiff-N-Wessun - Dah Shinin'"", ""Black Moon - War Zone"", ""Black Moon - Diggin' in dah Vaults"", ""Black Moon - Enta da Stage"", ""Cocoa Brovaz - The Rude Awakening""..peace"
2,The titles says 'energy medicine of the AMERICAS',"I took classes by Villoldo's students. After two years of learning a tradition called Inca, I found out I was learning medicine techniques that had no origin in South American shamanism and was a total fabrication of Villoldo. What a disappointment. I suggest if you want authentic stories and teachings on South American shamanism look elseware."
2,Donated to the public library......,"Donated to the public library......Shaman, Healer, Sage: How to Heal Yourself and Others with the Energy Medicine of the Americas....just not for me...reads more like a medical book!~"
5,Alberto's Sin's,"Poor Alberto, He wanted to be a psychologist, but he ended up being a tour guide.He wanted to appear on Oprah and appeal to popular culture, but he wouldn't even consent to an interview by the New York Times.To call Alberto an anthropologist is a JOKE. He is an exploiter of indigenous people.He's been married 5 times, and his current wife is 20 years his junior.Does this sound like a man who can help you?"
5,excellant book!,Read it and KNOW the healer within you. It compiles great knowledge and puts it into easy to read format. I highly recommend it and have given this book as gifts to a wide variety of people...not only energy healers.
2,"money,money,money",let me say that this book has some value but it should be listed as New Age. The good Doctor seems out to make money. I took a multiple day seminar with him and at the breaks he was on the phone with some broker. I think he was day trading. He seems to be a real shaman but went for the bucks a long time ago. I checked out his website and his was selling inexpensive stuff for ridiculous prices. Go find somebody else to read.
1,Reality or fiction II,"For those seeking more info about Dr. Villoldo's lack of detail and other concerns regarding truthfulness in contemporary shamanism, please see ""The Selling of the Shaman and the Problem of Informant Legitimacy"" which appears in the Summer 1990 issue of 'Anthropological Research', Volume 46, Number 2. Dr. Villoldo is prominently featured."
3,A peice of the whole,"This book offers you one important aspect of shamanism, dealing with the luminous body. However, shamanism also includes many other approaches to sensing, feeling and seeing, and many lack the ability to do so. If you check out [...], they offer distance initiations to awaken the shaman within, then you can better integrate the concepts within this book."
1,Concerned,"I approached Alberto Villoldo's [AV] tome with an open mind since a member of my family is now engaged in AV's shaman training. With each page I became more concerned for her welfare and stability. By the time I finished Shaman, Healer, Sage, I was downcast; AV seemed as grounded in reality as a J.K. Rowling fantasy - perhaps even less so. I know all too well that I can't intervene; she'll have to learn on her own how to distinguish fact from fiction, the healer from the promoter."
4,Insight to the world of the shaman,"Shaman, Healer, Sage is a fluid read, with many author experiences and teachings. The author gives exercises for the reader to use in order to really connect with their true inner self and heal on multiple levels. I have found this very worthwhile reading."
5,Day Care Favorite,"I was looking on Amazon to see if I could find another copy of this video as my day care children have just about worn it out. The kids are obsessed with this video. They range in age from 2 to 10. The school age children that I only have on days when they are out of school continue to ask to watch this video. They love the animation and the songs. The kids will dance along with many of the songs imitating what's going on in the video - it's a riot! Their favorite animated features are the train one where the caboose doesn't want to go across the broken track and the one where the bee chases the little man. The duck that continues to speed up is also hilarious. This video is referred to as the ""Bee Movie"" at my home. It's very interesting to the kids as well as adults. My own teenagers were singing some of the songs this morning on our way to school. Highly recommended!"
2,Nice collection but lousy execution,Of course we are happy to see these rare cartoons but the Bosko logo used at the bottom of the screen is distracting and the TV box that they use to frame the cartoons cropes the opening logo and makes the whole package appear off format. In other words we don't get the full screen.It looks very strange on modern tvs. I own it now but i hope someone comes out with a better package.
2,So-So Video on Wartime Cartoons,"This video is a real dissapointment. First, they don't show the openings, the WB bullseye and the MGM lion, or the ending signs(""That's all, Folks!"" for example). Second, the Dolby Surround Sound makes it stupid because it's not the original version. The quality on ""Scrap Happy Daffy"" is horrible! The only thing ""Any Bonds Today?"", is useful for is because they don't edit Bugs' immitation of Al Jolson. A wonderful collection of WWII Looney Tunes & Merrie Melodies is ""Bugs & Daffy: The Wartime Cartoons""."
4,A Complete Snafu!,"These wartime instructional cartoons had a rough job. They were to train soldiers without being boring. To do this they used the Animation Team at Warner Bros. Studios. They created a soldier named Private SNAFU (Situation Normal All F***ed Up!). After the misadventures of this loser, the hope was that the real soldiers watching would do things the opposite way. Some of these cartoons have been released before and many on Cartoon collection DVDs. But this is the entire series, for the first time. It is vastly entertaining, instructive and a very good window into the manners of that long-ago time (over 68 years). I recommend this DVD. The transfers are good and the content still funny. - James B. Wiser"
5,Buy this DVD before the PC police recall it.,"This DVD contains some great cartoons which are not shown anymore because they are not PC. Also of note, the ""Private Snafu"" cartoons, alone, are well worth the cost of the DVD. The restoration of the cartoons was excellent. The only negative I can find is that they do not show the entire opening credits."
4,SNAFU,"SNAFU - For those into history and those who like early animation this is a fun trip back in the ""Wayback Machine"". Not the most entertaining but by far it was meant to be informative to the general enlisted population. Many with just a 6th grade education. So, keeping this in mind enjoy the works of Dr. Suess and Mel Blanc before they word household names. Thats all folks!"
1,Buying this DVD was a big mistake.,"I have been a huge fan of the classic Warner Bros cartoons my entire life. So when I heard that a DVD of them was finally being released, I was very eager with anticipation. Much to my disappointment, all of the cartoons on this DVD are covered up with a ""Bosko Video"" logo. It's bad enough that logos like this cover up cartoons that are broadcast on TV, but there is no excuse to have such a logo on a home video. I wish that I had not bought this DVD. If you are reading this, then please, don't make the same mistake that I did."
2,"Great toons, but HOOOORRRRRIBLE dvd","I just got this dvd today and sweet jesus is this a horrible transfer to dvd. I honestly don't care about the logo, i'm am steamed, if you will, at the boarder that surrounds each of the toons. This really draws me back and makes me feel like this dvd is NOT worth the price tag is holds. This dvd feels really sloppy and underproduced. The least they could've done was make the toons fill out the whole freaking screen!!! Again, the toons are GREAT (and i'm generally not a big Looney Toons fan), but the dvd is really lousy."
1,The Private Snafu DVD is a ripoff.,"I just bought the ""Complete Uncensored Private Snafu"" DVD. This DVD is the very definition of fraud. On all of the cartoons, their is a ""Bosko Video"" logo that appears on screen, on top of the cartoons. The logo appears on top of the cartoons. The logo covers up parts of the cartoons. Because of this logo, the cartoons are not ""complete."" Because of this logo, the cartoons are not ""uncensored."" I am very angry. I am very mad. I am very upset. I have been ripped off. I am a victim of fraud. Why did they do this? Why did they cover up the cartoons? Why did they ruin what otherwise would have been a great DVD?"
1,"""Bosko Video"" logo ruins an otherwise great DVD.","As stated in the previous review, the ""Bosko Video"" logo that pops up during each of these 28 cartoons is so tacky that it renders the whole affair worthless. Might as well wait for them to be shown on television and record them. Definitely not for collectors. Bosko belongs in the VHS market."
1,thanks Amazon and Others!,"I bought this at Tower the other night. I came home and read what the others had written. Thank God I had not opened it! I promptly took it back. Shame on the producer for ruining this collection. From now on, I will always check Amazon and the customer reviews. Great feature, BTW."
1,Boring cartoons re-packaged,"I've seen cartoons on TV ranging from 1920s to the present.out of all the decades,I'd say these cartoons of the 1930s and 1940s were the worst ever!These cartoons have none of the appealing humour like the Disney cartoons of the 1920s;none of the enjoyment of Disney's Silly Symphonies.And unlike the crisp,colorful cartoons of the 50s-2005, these cartoons have dull backgrounds and the same recycled,boring jokes you find in any other Warner Brothers/Max Flescher/Popeye cartoons of the 30s and 40s.No unique jokes like ""Road Runner"",no bright,crisp,colorful backgrounds like ""Fat Albert"" or ""Hair Bear Bunch"",no inspired stories like ""Ruff & Reddy "" or ""Dexter's Lab.""Characters like Looney Toons and Popeye are dull,uninspired and not even funny when you compare them to cartoons like the 70s Looney Toons and Hanna-Barbera's version of ""Popeye.""don't waste your money on this collection-i recommend ""Silly Symphonies"" or ""Animaniacs"" instead."
1,The makers of this DVD have deliberately ruined it.,"I'm going to keep this review very brief. The cartoons on this DVD are pretty good. However, these cartoons are covered up by a ""Bosko Video"" logo. In my opinion, this logo ruins the DVD."
4,"Great 'toons, shoddy transfer","Yes, the Bosko logo is distracting and unnecessary. Worse is the terrible matte job, especially in part 1, the upper and right portion of the image is cut off, yet there is room on screen for the grey border in the lower and left sides. THAT is annoying! However, the content more than makes up for those problems IMHO."
1,"Great cartoons, terrible transfer to DVD","These are famous cartoons from WWII. But the transfer to DVD was totally botched. There's a grey frame around the image, cutting off part of the original picture. A ""Bosto Video"" logo appears over the image occasionally. This despite the fact that Bosto does not own the copyright in the original material. (Ref Library of Congress control number 97515282; the copyright applies to text and editing only.) Many of these cartoons are available from other sources at better quality. Still, Bosto did get them all on one DVD."
4,Voice and drum delirium,"Totico's voice is as hypnotizing as Patato's drumming. This is the true 'perfecta combinacion' tbat really should have received the acclaim Pacheco and Rodriguez received for their denuded version of the guaguanco back in the day. The music is bare and sparse yet thick and sticky. Several melodies, known and unknown, keep things interesting and moving. This is not background music. The vocal inflections and marvelous delivery by Totico makes every cut seem everlasting and endearing. His voice keeps above the drumming driving his message where it cannot be ignored. Patato could have been content to be a participant but his repique and slaps with almost impossible to follow rolls keeps the listener guessing for the next installment. I wish I had known about this disc when I was 15 and a much bigger fan of Afro Cuban sounds. Cachao is the catalyst that keeps this going. Percussion at its peak."
5,Patato & Totico,"Is Great this CD , i recommend it to everybody whos like the sounds of Congas , Rumba , Latin Jazz and Cuban Salsa............."
4,Still Great After 40 Years,"Within 8 bars of the first song, I was back in the Bronx! If you're an aficionado of Afro Cuban music, you'll love this album."
1,mark twain sam australia WA Perth,"This is by far the worst film that I have ever seen, even worst than Blood Ring if you've seen that. The location is only based at one spot: The Dessert. Dale 'apollo' Cook is a good fighter but it's a shame to see a waste of his talent in this project due to his very bad acting (which is normal) and very slow fight scenes which is unlike some of his other movies: This is the plot anyway.In the new arena of modern day gladiators, the price of failure is death. When the top gladiator, ""Amp"" (Dale 'apollo' Cook)' makes his bid to escape the clutches of the syndicate that runs these fights sends their evil henchman ""Mainframe"" (Greg Douglass) who eventually hunts him down in order to destroy Amp in a fixed tournament so he can become the new champion. Amp is almost caught but his girlfriend Lisa is slaughtered in the process of the escape. Now Amp has no choice but to stop running and fight the syndicate in pure hatred as vengeance for Lisa's death and for his freedom."
5,Excellent Book,"This is an excellent and very comprehensive book. I used it primarily to learn about state estimation. I had already taken courses on estimation, but this book was superior to the texts we used in class. It addresses many practical issues that are left out in the other textbooks that I've seen. Issues like how to determine the discrete-time process noise covariance given continuous dynamics and continuous time process noise covariance are covered by Stengel."
2,Content may be fine but print quality is atrocious,"I just received this book. The print quality is really quite bad. Printed letters in bold type often touch one another and there is a diffusion between print and surrounding white space. I would get a headache if I had to read this for any extended period of time. Also, the paper is cheap quality more porous than better quality paper.I'm returning this book immediately. Can anyone vouch for print quality of used copies published earlier?"
1,"Ours came without all the parts, and Leapfrog won't replace it","This toy was shipped to us without the second, third and fourth stage cards. Because it is a new product, Leapfrog has no ""replacement parts"" and so can't send me the rest of the stages. Nor will they send me a replacement. You might want to buy it in a store where you can open the box to make sure it's all there."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this toy as an alternative to my son's activity gym. He was almost 3 months old when I bought it. It was frustrating because he wasn't interested in stage 1, but liked stage 2. Stage 2 starts at 3 months, but your child needs to be able to press the levers himself or you have to be there the entire time to press them for him. It just didn't keep him interested like his other toys do."
5,Great toy for the youngest infants!,"My daughter loved this toy from the time she was only 2 months old - even when she was too young for the most basic toys. The lights and music keep her attention, and the music is enjoyable for all of us. Durable, educational, and versatile (since it has different cards for different developmental stages) - I love this toy!!!UPDATE: My daughter played with this toy until she was about 3, and even now (she is 5) we still sing the ""rainbow song"". We handed it down to a friend's son who didn't enjoy it AS much as my daughter did, but still got LOTS of use out of it. The toy still works like the day we took it out of the box. I suppose your experience may vary, but I swear by this toy. (Okay, I wish it had more letter cards and/or song cards, but it's still great, and the black/white classical music was genius!)"
3,My daughter losts interest in it after 2 months. need more screens.,"When we first got the product for our daughter at 2-months old, she loved it. But now she seems to lost interest in it. We keep changing the slide-out screens and play with her, but it doesn't help. We hope there are more slide-out screens developed for the product. 4 screens are definitely not enough."
1,Daughter showed no interest in this toy.,"I bought this toy because I thought that it would be interactive, but she pushes one button and the music goes on and on, and she loses interest. She hardly played with it. She prefered the Fisher Price baby gyms."
2,My son doesn't like it,"We got this toy as a gift, when my son was 3 months old. He didn't like it at all, looked scared of it and started to cry after a while. We also have a Fisher Price system with animals hanging from it and he loves that! He can grab those and couldn't reach the shapes on this one. Also, the music is very loud and he gets startled by it."
5,Perfect introduction to Tuna,"This is the perfect intro to Hot Tuna. It has acoustic, acoustic live, and electric and electric live. Good sound quality and lots of music."
4,Jam band,Wanted a more complete example of the band without having to have every album they ever did. This fills the bill and makes a nice addition to my library of tunes.
2,You'd be better off having your kid watch the TV show,"I'm not a Dora fan. Nor am I fan of branded merchandise in general - why should I pay good money to cultivate brand loyalty in my kid?With that said, I'm even less a fan of this book than I would be, because it's not even as well-written as the episode it's based off of."
5,Stars,"My mom got my 4-year old sister Little Star By Sarah Willson and she enjoyed it much. I read it to her every night. My friend and me did a play on this book. My sister liked the play. My friend was Dora and I was boots, the grumpy old troll, and swiper. I enjoyed doing it."
3,Cute book,"This is a companion book to the TV episode of the same name. The book is big with full color pictures for every page. The text size is adequate, and the text is in complete, correct sentences. No, the sentences do not rhyme, but they do make sense. Overall, the book is appropriate for 3-year olds on up."
2,"Good book for ideas, but hard to actually build one","The book is good for general ideas, but I would not try to use it for any of the larger then say 4x8 plans. I would have liked more plans and careful layouts in normal spaces. You don't get this with this book. I did end up snagging a few ideas here and there for my own plan though."
1,The first G.T.R.T.W. is hundred time more better ...,"I heard the first Guitare that rule the world,and I rate it 5 star, but the second vol.sound so fuzzy that it isn't rock n'roll at all.This one spoiled the rock n'roll spirit!"
1,Don't Buy This CD,The quality of this CD made it unusable. It was a waste of money and went directly into the trash.
4,Intriguing Classic 90s Hippie Story of a Little Known World,"If you thought that all the hippies became yuppies, think again! The community of flower children has only grown stronger! Guy Mount takes you in, and you won't want to go back to that mainstream world...classic murder mystery spine tingling suspense story to boot! This author owned publishing company has some other off beat titles worth reading that you won't find elsewhere, but the Marijuana Mystery you will not be able to put down, nor will you easily forget. Keep in mind that legalization is just around the corner and you may just become an activist! This novel is the needle in the haystack of hippie literature; even the Kool Aid Acid Test is boring by comparison. This is not anthropological though, but just a great story."
5,A great guide and teaching of African oracles,"This book has taught me how to delve deep into knowing any given situation. It is amazing to see the situations or experiences unfold from a reading divined through the Obi. I have found this book to be a serious practical guide to understanding how the creator and/or the principals of the creators speak to us. Each reading takes you on a road of greater indepth knowledge about myself, other people, and the world around me. You will not leave home without your oracle guide book. Get closer to your roots and knowing how African Civilizations were built on the basis of such oracles and divine readings."
4,Tomahawk Cruise Missile Review,"This review will be quite short. The information is VERY accurate, and the history is as well. How do I know? I'm the guy who took most of the photos of Tomahawk used in the book-including the aerial shots.T.W. ""Budda"" Landis"
2,Dont buy downloadable copy!,Dont buy a downloadable copy of this book. You can not even print it. I usually read most of such publications when I am communting in the train. It was painful to read this book only from my desktop (I could not even copy it onto my laptop).Much of the information presented is available freely on the web either through articles or white papers. Its not worth the money to buy this. I could not see any additional value from this book.
4,nice furniture,The piece was easy to put together. BUT... some of the cast metal pieces to attach the sides together broke. So I had to buy small L brackets and screw them to the sides to have a more stable joining of the sides. Hardware needs to be better quality. Otherwise I would recommend this product.
1,error,"Please note that this order was taken in error and never received. Credit was to be issued. Note: Because the problem has yet to be resolved, I did a rating only for the purpose of submitting this review."
1,Don't waste your dough,"At US$103, this video is a waste of money. At 50cents it would be waste of money. No plot, no script and the worlds worst actor Pete Postlething."
1,Horrible machine,"Please do yourself a favor and stay away from this piece of crap. Mine broke down twice to the point where they had to send replacements, and I rarely used it. The fax did not work at all in the second printer I got, and I was so fed up at this point with being on hold with the very slow customer service that I trashed the thing and got an HP printer. This is simply not a reliable machine in any way and there is no reason to buy it with much better options out there."
1,One word discribes this....,"CRAP!!!Seriously the worst fax machine I have ever owned, even worse then my terrible $59 brother!This can only fax a few pages at a time, 2 to be exact. Anything above that won't go through.SSSSLLLLOOOOOWWWW Printing and Faxing... Turtles walk faster than this thing prints and faxes!Printing out pics is a nightmare, granted this isn't really made for that type of printing, but if you decide to print out a small pic it looks terrible.Calling customer service is great until the operator starts talking and you can understand a darn thing he says. I've called several times so it wasn't a one time thing.All in all the worst purchase I ever made, and buying from staples I thought I was safe however they only have a 15 day return window. I will never purchase a Lexmark again!"
5,A Delightful Blast from the Past,"Seeing a couple of terrific actors at a very early stage of their career was a real treat. And I believe some reviewers do not take into account the outstanding singing performance of Justine Bateman--especially in the final, signature title song ""Satisfaction."" People trying to take this movie a bit too seriously should simply kick back and enjoy it for what it is."
5,I loved the original soundtrack,"If any of you can tell me where to get the original soundtrack of this great film, please, make me know it. I'm desperatly looking for it since I first watched the movie five years ago!"
3,Once in a While a Bit of Nostalgia Suits the Palate,"SATISFACTION is not a great movie by any shakes, but taken for what it was meant to be - a slightly naive tale of a girls' band that has a summer of adventure, love and opportunity for the big time nut opts instead to become just a group of life-long friends - it is a well done bit of pastiche. Thanks to the simple script by Charles Purpura and to the sensitive direction of Joan Freeman the little story works well.The interesting aspect of the film is the cast. The band consists of leader Justine Bateman with Trini Alvarado, Britta Phillips, Scott Coffey as the token male, Deborah Harry and yes, the movie debut of Julia Roberts! Liam Neeson serves as the love interest for Justine Bateman's character and Michael DeLorenzo has a small part, too. The music is fun and the cast commits to the idea of the film well. Strange to see a film from 1988 with the established stars disappearing and the 'newcomers' taking flight. Grady Harp, December 06"
2,"A Very Weak Album, But It Dose Have Its Moments!","O.K. I was terribly disapointed by this album. After the success of ""Time"" I was hoping this would be as good or better. Unfortunatly I was wrong. ....But this Ablum dose have one good song. Kutulu(The Mad Arab Part 2) is one of the best Mercyful Fate songs ever. ....10.Kutulu(The Mad Arab Part 2)(1,000,000 Stars)-Here is the strong point of the album. This song is awsome. It has a nice rhythm, and good guitar, and great lyrics. It just blows the origional ""The Mad Arab"" out of the water. This is great music. It is one of the best new Mercyful Fate songs ever. ........"
4,Great band ... Great album,"After listening to the album,I would say that it is well worth the money I paid for it.Not the best Mercyful Fate album but good ,the best would have to go to Mellisa or Don't Break The Oath , as I'm sure alot of other Mercyful Fate die hards would probably say the same . Pick it up, I'm sure you will enjoy !"
5,Review of AG: Man of Spirit,"This work sits perfectly in the space between a children's book and an adult's introduction; it serves well as either The book is full of vivid pictures from historical works of art animating the life of Alexander. The information given is quite detailed, offering a superb introduction to the life of Alexander. Furthermore, there is a large appendix featuring source literature on the life and legacy of Alexander."
4,great debut,This is a great debut record. I happened to come upon it while in my local record store. I heard it as soon as I walked in and his voice and guitar caught my ear instantly. I heard about 4-5 songs while searching for what I was going to buy that day and then I realized that I definitely had to purchase the record being played.It is a record full of great songs with a decent amount of variation. Most of the songs are lovely acoustic pieces with beautiful backing FX and it almost sounds like a more accessible Flying Saucer Attack. A few of the songs even move into electronic territory and they are also great. His voice is definitely one of the key factors of the music as he is able to take a song that may seem melodically weak at first and fill it with his rich and wonderful yet hushed voice.Imagine a laptop Elliott Smith and you have a pretty fair idea of this guys sound. Definitely recommended.
5,A soundscape of mood shifts,Imagine Iron and Wine meets downbeat indie electronic and here you have the result. Divine!
4,great value,"This is my second Fobus holster and It works as well as my other one, however my friend who is a recently retired police officer has the same holster and it takes the strength of a mule to get the gun out. I'm happy he is not"
5,Most Comfortable Holster I Own.,"This is literally the most comfortable holster I own. It hugs the body very nicely, holds the weapon securely and is very easy to take in and out of your waistband. I was skeptical that a holster at this price point could be this good. The Israelis have done their homework on this one.....I'm very pleased."
1,Audible Version,"I purchased the inexpensive Audible version to burn CD's for listening in the car. I was disappointed because the Audible version is one long track of 2+hours. Although you can burn all it to one DVD, you cannot easily cue or repeat specific tracks unless you spend time to edit and split up the tracks. Judging from the Audible track, I would say that the CD portion of this product is very elementary. It starts with basic phrases (article+adjective+noun)such as ""the red book,"". The audio track slogs along in a very dry sentence-by-sentence repetition pattern with chirpy directives in between. Imagine cueing through it a few times..."
3,"Pretty cool, but wide and heavy.","I work in IT and co-workers tend to make tools disappear, so this seemed like something handy to have.The quality of the included tools is great, and once you get used to carrying it around, you almost feel lost without it. It really does seem to have just about everything a geek would need. Oddly enough, the DIP switch tool is actually a ballpoint pen. Personally, I think that's more useful, but keep that in mind if you care about keeping your DIP switches pristine.That all said, it's much thicker than it appears in the picture -- maybe about an inch or so. It's also heavier than an iPod, which takes some getting used to. The Ruby finish looks great when you first get it, but it scratches very easily.If you have a need for a lot of the tools, this is great to have. But if you're at all concerned with size and weight, you might want to pass on this."
5,Best Father's Day Gift I Ever Received,"I got a CyberTool Swiss Army Knife two years ago (or maybe three) for Father's Day and despite it being wide and heavy, rarely a day goes by that it isn't weighting down my pocket. It is just too useful to leave behind. I've worked on computers, installed a car stereo, trimmed hair, signed restaurant checks, removed splinters, cut out articles, opened wine, bent wires, repaired eyeglasses, replaced electrical outlets, and occasionally even used it as a traditional pocket knife. I'm sure I'm leaving out some of the other uses as well.Great item and a great gift idea!"
5,lots of knives,"I own several different SA knives, this is my most recent acquisition. I got it because I've been working on upgrading computers. I got the 34 tool version. The different bits are neat, and really very useful dismantling computers to install new parts."
5,What would I do without it?,"What would I do without it?I'd have to replace it with another one.This thing is invaluable. True, I won't be using the can opener anytime soon, but this baby can unscrew eyeglass screws and open wine bottles.The knives are very sharp and open packages quickly, and you even get a sharp pair of mini-scissors. You wouldn't believe how handy those scissors become when you need to cut with pricision. (Imagine xActo knife type stuff...) Big scissors would just ruin your project.Most importantly, the knife is called CyberTool because it comes with what you might need to repair a computer, including Philips head and flat head appropriate-sized fittings to unscrew computer hardware and tower cases. There's also a hard-to-find pin (like a needle), which I'm sure is used to flip a tiny switch.There's even a pen hidden inside it! Gotta love it."
3,Never received item,The item in question was never received due to misship. Not only was it not received but the requested replacement was not shipped as promised by the customer service rep. I can't rate the item as I don't have it.
5,Swiss Army Knife Holder,Excellent holder for my Swiss Army Knife. A must have for the Cyber tool 34. The item arrived faster than I thought it would. Most definately will shop with this store again.
5,cool,"powerful and useful , so cool it look like!And trust me you will use it many times in your daily life!"
4,Smaller Patches for Smaller Guns,"These are small patches designed for small guns, but it's nice to get a bulk of them to have on hand."
5,A valued companion to the study of the Civil Rights Movement,"I think that this book is a valued companion to Taylor Branch's epic work ""Parting the Waters"". Together, they make an unbeatable pair of study aids for one of America's most turbulent periods.While P.T.W. is a more dispassionate third person chronicle, E.O.T.P. is more personally driven. It brings to life individuals like Bayard Rustin, Stokley Carmichael, John Lewis and other giants (known and obscure) of the movement. Events from the Till lynching to the Attica riots as seen through the eyes of those on the scene (sometimes, those making the scene).Fascinating reading."
4,Great Book to Begin Learning,This is a great book to get get a background on the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950's and 60's. I read it when I began trying to learn about the CRM and some of the key players.
3,kept me reading until the last twenty pages,"Jim Lewis is a master at adopting the female persona, and his ability to hold my interest was uncanny and, frankly, quite surprising. I found myself eagerly holding on through Caroline's journey, waiting for an end that would justify my enthusiasm; unfortunately, I was left dissatisfied. Such an enormous novel deserves a grander finale."
3,Disturbing but Curious,"I wanted to see Caroline get her due in the end, but was denied the opportunity, which was a shame since we saw every other secret detail of the tightly knit sphere of neuroticism and borderline insanity she lived in. Beautiful writing but sometimes the layers hindered the plot instead of advancing it. But then when did Caroline ever make anything easy?"
3,"Very Cool, Though Not Everything Works!","When they are at the top of their game on this CD, The Tornadoes are pure 100% Surf-Guitar, nothing watered down! Starting off mellow & cool with ""Busting Surfboards,"" then going into the exotic ""Malaguena"" (same melody as the Russian folk song ""Dark Eyes""), and then into... ""Summertime?"" That, and ""Old Shep"" really seemed out of place on a surf CD. Both of these songs had vocals, which were not one of The Tornadoes' stronger points! Their cover of ""Johnny B. Goode"" wasn't terrible, but... sorry, Chuck Berry is the only one who can do that one ""just right!""The rest of the CD is very good. This is one of those bands that should have stayed away from vocals; their tunes with lyrics seem to mask their too-cool surf-sound, but their instrumental pieces are incredible!"
3,"Go, Roly, go!","""Bustin' Surfboards"" was a forgotten surf instrumental, until it was included inPulp Fiction. Because of that new publicity, The Tornadoes' only album was reissued on CD. The album includes a lot of great surf instrumentals, especially ""Bustin' Surfboards"", ""The Gremmie"" and ""Shootin' Beavers"". Unfortunately, the album also includes three mediocre vocal songs (""Summertime"", ""Old Shep"" and ""Johnny B. Goode""). These songs don't really fit in with the feel of the rest of the album. But that's what the ""skip"" button is for on your CD player, right?"
3,Packed with facts.,"This book is a great resource for finding facts of fallen northwestern shortlines and predecessor railroads. I have found the facts to be mostly accurate, though they do not always match to some of the more well-read books about the larger railroads in the region. The biggest complaint is that it is visually unappealing, and could be a little more 'polished': no color pictures, and fairly few black and white pictures. Still, it is packed with charts, graphs and valuable company stats and info."
5,Great bagged tea,"I drink a lot of loose leaf tea, but tea bags can be convenient sometimes. This is the best bagged earl grey I've tasted. I would recommend steeping it for 3 mins instead of the 4-5 they recommend though, unless you are going to add a lot of sweetener and/or milk. It starts getting bitter after 3 minutes."
4,Very good tea,Very good robust flavor. Excellent with milk or cream. I would go with other comments and err on the side of steeping it longer than instructed on the box for maximum flavor.
5,Harney and Sons Earl Grey Supreme,"Earl Grey lovers will certainly enjoy this tea. The tin keeps the sachets fresh (and it's useful when emptied). Experiment with brewing times to find your personal preference. I do not use cream, lemon, or sweentener so I prefer a quick steeping. A friend gave me my first Harney & Sons tea, and I've become a convert to their brand. Tropical Green, Wedding, Paris, and everything Earl Grey, all outstanding."
3,"smells great, tastes bland","The steeping instructions say to leave tea bag in the mug for 5 minutes for best flavor - I say it's more like 20 mins. It smells really great, but there just isn't that much flavor. On the otherhand, from the texture of the water, at least it looks like they don't cheat by coating the tea leaves with oil to enhance the flavor."
5,Very Pleased!,I am very pleased with my purchase of Harney and Sons Earl Grey Supreme Tea. It arrived in a timely manner and is a very top quality tea.
1,westside connecton is wack,This is so wack Common ripped them so bad . Yo Common told Mack 10 he ain't no Mack 10 he's a 22 .Ice cube just got shredded and after his first album it was a wrap . He was better of getiing his money snatch by Eazy E and Jerry Heeler .When I get my deal they will get dissed so nasty but not W.C because I like his music
4,WESTSIDE,"This album is just pure west coast rap at its best, puttin straight to all the East Coast people on All The Critics in New York, and King Of The Hill. The only problem with this album is that there are only 10 songs, all of which are good nonetheless, but go and Terrorist Threats instead if you aren't into old school rap."
3,Not Bad,"Pretty good album. Mack 10 & W.C. pretty good.1. World Domination- Dont rate intro's.2. Bow Down- First single. It pretty good. 4/53. Gangsta's Make The World Go Round- 2nd single. Dont like it. 2.5/54. All The Critics In New York- Pretty much dissing NYC. not bad. 3/55. Do You Like Criminals F/ K-Dee- Pretty good. 3.5/56. Gangsta's Dont Dance- Skit.7. The Gangsta, The Killa And The Dope Dealer- Not Bad. 3/58. Cross Em Out And Put An A 'K- Not Bad. 3/59. King Of The Hill- Dissing Cypress Hill. 5/510. 3 Time Felons- Barely A pass. 2.5/511. Westward Ho- pretty good. 4/512. The Pledge- Skit.13. Hoo-Bangin F/ K-Dee, Tha Comrades & All Frum Tha l- O.k. 3/5I also own Terrorist Threats by westside connection, Ice Cube's greatest hits Mack 10's The Paper Route and W.C.'s ghetto heisman and i think all those titles are better."
5,1 of tha last true gangsta rap groups left,This cd is 1 of tha best cds eva made after 1995 cause they keep real and dont suga coat it like now with all this pop-rap they got if u like tha straight up gangsta rap like back in tha day buy this cd its off tha hook if u lik this cd buy their new cd too Terrorist Threats Ice cube Mack 10 and Wc are still keepin there style tha same with tha straight up gangsta s--- fo real but i dont think this cd is for every1 if u live in tha sub burbs or in nice neighborhoods dont buy this cd cause u wont lik it stick to pop-rap u used too
4,the only cut by WestSide Connection I truly dig all the way,as a Group WestSide Connection is a little Hit&alot of Miss&alot of Antics.but on this Joint they are Banging Fo SHO!.WC.Mack 10&ICe Cube Bring the Pain on this Cut.this was a Jam I was Bumping to back in 96.dig the Groove&that WEST--SIDE Vibe of the Track.
4,Terrorist Threats is better,"This album sort of introduces the Westside Connection for the first time along with WC and Mack 10, with Ice Cube already being well-known.Part of this album is about dissin the critics from New York, and everybody not down with the Westside Connection. It also is about that the Westside Connection is going to be and almost already is on top. There are some select songs that just describe members in the group in general like 3 Time Felons and The Gangsta, Killa, and Dopedealer.My personal favorite songs are Bow Down, Westward Ho and Hoo-Bangin.This is one of my favorite westside albums, the only problem is the ammount of songs here, 10.This album is worth most of your money, but I suggest you buy Terrorist Threats instead."
4,Good but not representative of LA,"Ice Cube has not made anything as good as BOW DOWN since he left NWA.However,it ain't the good way to answer EAST COAST critics.Ice Cube best songs has always been produced by DRE,the best ones in my opinion are ""NATURAL BORN KILLAZ"" and ""GAME OVER"". Whatever WC or ICE CUBE did,do and will do is better than anything else from NY!!!! But the third ""MC"",MACK 10,i can't bear it,he's the shame of LA."
5,"FORGET YOUR FLAVOUR OF THE MONTH, BUY THIS!!!","ive been a cube fan for as long as i can remember and i only just got this album yesterday although i had heard of it for years!!!it is...without question the best gangsta rap album i have EVER heard in my life, and ive hears a lot. i dont care if your down for the east coast or west coast or whatever, i dont care if they diss cypress hill and Q-tip, i dont care about critics who hate mack 10, and i dont care about all you DRE fans who were scared to stay with CUBE.just listen to the production on this album...all the tracks are amazing and you cant sit still whilst listening to them...my favourites were 'BOW DOWN','GANGSTAS MAKE THE WORLD GO ROUND','THE GANGSTA THE KILLA AND THE DOPE DEALER' and 'KING OF THE HILL'.never heard of westside connection? keep the reciept...but you'll end up tearing it up which is exactly what these three true players do. PEACE AND IM OUT."
5,The best living/working group in rap today.,"As i said the best group in rap today. Smooth Lyrics, real rap artists (ICE CUBE, MAC 10, WC)doing what they do best an album for the people not for the radio. If you like Ice cube at all buy this album NOW. The title track is just one of an album full of songs that are well written from top to bottom. This isn't an album with four songs and 17 skits it is all music.They do get in to the East/West thing as could be expected from the groups name, but they don't make slamming the competition a priority over making good music. The best Rap album i've bought in years."
5,BOW DOWN IS THE BEST ALBUM EVER,BOW DOWN IS THE BEST ALBUM EVER ITS ONE OF ICE CUBES BEST PERFORMANCES AND THE OTHER 2 WESTSIDE MC'S ARE GOOD TOO!!!
5,This CD is one of the Greatest!!!,I heard of this CD from one of my friends and I thought it was really cool. I haven't got the CD yet but hope to get it soon.
5,WAY Outlands!,"This is the third audio book of the Outlanders series to which I have listened. It was also the best. In each of the other books, the heroes kicked a** and the story went on. This time little guys were the big shots. In the end our heroes won out over the bad guys but you had to stop and remind yourself who the good guys were. After all the bad guys had far more self control and appeared more honest than our heroes. I hated having the spacestation blow up though, I would have been happier with that avenue left for exploring."
4,Good view of a real captain,"I listened to the audiotape version of this book. Very enjoyable, though the author is very understated in his reporting of events. The author's courtship got no explanation and his marriage no more than a sentence, and he barely mentions his wife thereafter; an encounter with a pirate vessel is reported in a matter-of-fact manner that is not as gripping as it probably was in reality. If you're looking for ""The Perfect Storm"" this book does not have the same level of drama, but nonetheless it is an interesting and accurate portrayal of what life was like for a real sea captain in the early 1880s. Recommended!"
4,A wonderful book! Read this. A great adventure!,"This was a fine book , a tale of a 19th century mearchant captain who rose through the ranks. It is a log of his life,a book of adventures. Although I rated it 4 stars ( it became confusing in some parts, he wrote as if his actions were ovious and left some things out). It was a great book. I highly recomend it."
2,A Suction Cup? Please!,"They need to revise this game - the idea is good, but the suction cup ruins all the fun! It is hard to catch any fish on that cup, which is also very small. We had to moisten the darn thing to get anything stuck on it, and even then it takes some pressure to get a fish hooked. Returning it back to the store."
1,The game I received was used!,I am so mad. I ordered this game back in August when I started ordering my Christmas gifts. Yesterday I started wrapping the gifts and thought it was strange that there was black sharpie markings on all sides of the box. I opened it up and all 4 boats had sharpie scribbles on them. Really . . . REALLY! I am not rating the game; I can't imagine an Amazon Vendor sending out something that would appear on the shelves of a Salvation Army store!!!!!
3,that's ok,"is pretty funny, but when I bought it I thought it was another type of game, but it's pretty funny and very cute box"
2,not the best,I've had 3 ATSC tuners and this is by far the worst. The picture is just not very good. There is a bug in the guide where the descriptions don't match the shows.
4,Round 2,Got this for our 2 year old because it looks like daddy's saw and he loves to help daddy! Unfortunately it only lasted two weeks of normal toddler wear and tear (no major falls or getting wet) before it quit working. Lil guy was super bummed! However I contacted the seller and they got a new one from the manufacturer to us within a week which we were very pleased with. It's now been over two weeks with the new one and so far so good.
3,"A little too salty, but spiced just right","We love dirty rice and eat it often. I got Tony Chachere's Dirty Rice Mix to try it, and was pleased with the Cajun seasonings. I did find it too salty the first time (800+ mg sodium per small serving!), but the second time I added the water to the mix in a separate bowl, mixed to dissolve and then poured a little of the salty water off. I added fresh water to make up what I poured off, then added it to the browned hamburger.I would have given this 5 stars if it hadn't been so salty. As a comparison, Zatarain's Dirty rice has 600 mg sodium per serving, and Luzianne Dirty Rice has 680 mg per serving."
4,My Finger Slipped,"I just realized that I first gave this album 5 stars when I meant to give it 4. My finger must have slipped on the mouse. But anyway, this is still Silkk's best album and it's a great addition to your collection! The best songs are Murder, I Ain't Takin No Shorts, MR., Free Loaders, If My 9 Could Talk, My Car, Got Em Fiendin, and Why My Homie. Buy this today!"
1,Worst ever,Silk the Shocker is THE WORST RAPPER EVER!!!!!!!!!! Want proof listen to him mumble and bumble on this CD.
2,Young Silkk,"I gave this CD a ""2"" because I only like a couple cuts on here, but my favorite one on here is ""Freeloaders."""
3,"Great price, quality stuff, BECAREFUL though","I ordered three of these for my CPU (already had one). They were the best deal, Kingston makes good products and they proved to hold up to the name. However, my one old memory went bad so I went back to my account here on Amazon and simply re-ordered another one. Unfortunately, I received memory with a different DIMM; all must have the same DIMM for the best memory management. It seems Amazon restocked the stock number with different chips. My fault, should have checked the description; but I thought re-orderer with the same item number would give me the same item. Not so."
3,Ms.O book review Colin McKeefery,THE PERECT STORM is a great book that tells a story about a fishing boat and the storm of the century.It takes place on halloween which is kinda spooky. The main characters are the crew on the boat.The storm was one of the worst the National Wheather Bureau has seen to date. This true-story tragedy would be good for anyone who likes a thriller.I would give this book 3stars
5,WHAT AN AMAZING BOOK ABOUT A TERRIBLE TRAGEDY,This is another good book about ocean fishing but with a freak storm that has ttragic effects. definite worthwhile read.If you have not already watch the movie. also get a chance read the hungry ocean
4,Near Perfect Tome.,"Sebastian Junger's volume truly captures the sights, sounds, smells, and emotions of hurly burly Gloucester. Read the book before seeing the movie and you will not be disappointed by either.The plot is classic man against nature but with an updated twist. Shakespearian in nature. Since almost all will know the ending, it is no easy task to keep one's interest througout, Yet Junger does so masterfully. He truly makes us care for the characters and goes to great pains to educate us on just how and why the confluence of events occurred to cause such a catastrophic result."
3,One Good Chapter,"The chapter dedicated to the US Air Force Pararescue efforts drew me to this book, and it was the only chapter that interested me. But all in all, that one chapter was excellent, and the reason I give it 3 stars.The rest of the book was filled with unappealing people doing uninteresting things."
1,A tragic event that reads like a textbook,"I haven't been this sorely disappointed with a book in a long time. This book was recommended under the banner ""If you liked 'Into Thin Air' you'll love...."" A crucial difference, however, is that Krakauer has an unerring eye for the TELLING detail. In ""Into"" he describes the inevitability of the Everest tragedy with a haunting relentlessness and emotional impact. Junger, meanwhile, layers numerous dry, technical descriptions over ""characterizations"" that, while meant to evoke an emotional bond, just had me screaming for him to get on with it already. This book is nothing more than a collection of gramatically pristine sentences."
1,Explanation Overides Story,"This was not the ""white-knuckle adventure"" the jacket copy described. The author felt compelled to name and explain too many nautical details. Perhaps, if one has had training in the navy, a maritime academy, or on a fishing vessel, THE PERFECT STORM would be sensible--even exciting. However, I found myself (a true landlubber) silently screaming at Mr. Junger to just get on with it and to forget his esoteric descriptions. In short, this book was cast out to sea long before I completed it."
3,How's about some pictures?,"I am almost finished with THE PERFECT STORM and agree with the predeeding reviewer that Mr. Junger's grammar could be a bit tighter, but that's what editors are for, right? My point of contention is that because this story is meant to appeal to a wide audience, diagrams of the Andrea Gail with its various components would seem to be a worthy idea. It would seem peculiar that there are no pictures of any of the sword ships that are mentioned nor are there any photos of any of the six men who lost their lives aboard the Andrea Gail. However, there is a plea for financial contributions for a foundation??? Strange. The story itself is very compelling and, as a person happily ensconced on land, I cannot even imagine what it would be like to face waves that are larger than some of the buildings around me. The Perfect Storm is a good book for those with a grander capability of visualization than I."
2,Expected More,"I was drawn to this book, mainly as I lived half of my life just south of Gloucester Mass. Having been at the beach as the waves were tossed ashore by an offshore hurricane, I have always loved and yet feared the oceans power. This book could have been so much more. Every time I started to be drawn in to the lives of those involved, I ended up being distracted by so much technicality. Was it really necessary to know every little detail of the weather patterns? It was hard to picture alot of his detail. Still, I didn't hate the book, but honestly, I was mostly bored."
4,fiction,I did find the book fun to read. But Junger uses a rather deep imagination to convey his non - fiction story. Any one who is an avide fisherman or sailer will enjoy this book. Though I warn everyone not to buy in to the speculation. In sea's as bad as described in this book any number of things could have ocurred which where not covered in this book. Steve
3,"it was good but if you want a 'real' book, try Spike Walker.","I enjoyed ""The Perfect Storm"", however, I couldn't help but compare it to Spike Walker's ""Working on the Edge"". In comparison to Walker's work, ""The Perfect Storm"" pales. It is difficult to overlook the fact that this is in some ways a work of fiction, based on conjecture and heresay."
2,hypothetical v.actual depiction,"I commend the author for his story-telling ability. However, the main aspect of the story -- the tragedy at sea -- was written in a way in which the shipwreck ""probably happened"". The fact that there was a horrible accident -- with no evidence except a floating empty gas can -- no one disputes, but its impossible to determine what actually occured to those men on the Andrea Gail. I got a fascinating history lesson of making a life off of the sea but not much else."
2,The Perfect Storm,Dissapointed...with all the hype I expected a blockbuster. The movie will surely be better than the book.
1,fabulous,"The Perfect Storm was a great book. I liked how the author used peoples real experiences to provide different scenarios of what could have happened to the crew. it was kind of confusing because he talks about like 10 different boats at the same time, but it is not that hard to follow. If you think it is the same as the movie, you are wrong. The movie is more eventful, but it is a good experience to read the book."
3,Beware of offensive language,"This is a true story of men against the sea, battling a fierce storm.For mature readers only. Not only does the book require a high reading level, but it includes instances of offensive language. Near the beginning, there is a lot of reading about sailors spending time in bars. Also, the nature of the book causes there to be detail about people drowning, weather systems and ship design."
1,EVER BEEN THERE?,"9 OF 10 ADVENTURE STORIES (INC. WAR STORIES)i find lacking & Mr. Junger & His perfect storm qualifies.Perhaps as a novel it would have worked but unfortunetly it isn't that! While the best combat stories are NOT always written by those who've been there(and the same holds true for sea stories etc.-)the old journalism device of ""joining the brotherhood"" so as to ""understand & qualify"" generally doesn't work here.!Had Mr Junger been a commercial fisherman some years before writing his ""storm "" perhaps I could be less subjective.Conrad was a seaman not because He wanted a license to write! A working Class hero is still something to be (as Mr. Lennon said so well.)---""R.V.N. COMBAT INFANTRY 68-69,TAYLOR DIVING & SALVAGE North Sea -78-79 Ocean Sailor- Force 12experience-ongoing sailor."
2,Flat and flawed,"Flat characterizations, confusing transitions, and over dramatizing in some scenes -- are PJs really supermen? Is Ray Leonard really that dumb and selfish? Whatever happened to the Sartori did it eventually sink? Is the author claiming, and then justifying, the Coast Guard's turning off the Andrea Gale's EPIRB? This is a serious charge. Some of the history and technique of commercial fishing sounds accurate, as does the drowning description, but this is fiction so how much can any of the seemingly factual stuff be relied on? Mr. Junger should have signed on as a fishing boat crew member first then he might have been able to write about something he knows. Not worth the money."
3,A suspenseful tale of life and death on the Grand Banks,"Unlike most other readers, I found this book most compelling in its details of the ocean, storms, and the design of the boats and not in the life and death of several swordfishermen. I did not find myself personally attached to the main characters, rather I saw the protagonists as pawns in the sea of life and death. Junger's intermixing of history with current events provides the reader with perspective and context by which to comprehend the ""100 year storm"". Perhaps most fascinating of all is the vast lengths the Coast Guard and Navy went to save their lives and those of several of their rescuers. The selflessness of the PJs will serve as a reminder that people truly are willing to sacrifice for the aid of others. Overall, a fascinating look at a lifestyle and the circumstances surrounding it that few of us will ever know."
4,Great Reading - Get ready for two days,"This is a great book to escape into for a weekend(2-3 days).A fairly richly detailed reconstruction of a real event, the author takes you through the preparations of a final voyage, the voyage and the significant peripheral events which surround it.A stunning description of life on the high seas (literally and figuratively), if you want real-life action, this is the next best thing.Having said all of that, however, there are some problems with the author's writing style which can be overlooked but would have enhanced the story that much more.In all, a wise investment for your entertainment dollar. Forgo one sub-par movie this summer and get this book."
3,"SCARY, INTERESTING, MAKES YOU THINK","I ENJOYED THE BOOK, BUT THERE WAS NO WAY IT COULD live up to it's hype."
1,schlock,"if you enjoy reading novels with over-the-top dramatization and/or boring (and overly simplified) technical discussions of marine transportation, then by all means, read this book!Or you could just wait for the movie."
2,MS.O LA- CHARLIE REDINGER,"The Perfeect Storm was okay. It was boring because there was only one exciting part, and the rest just talked about fishing. The idea is good but Sebastian just screwed it all up by writing too much junk. Silly Sebastian. He seems like a good writer but he needs to get to the point. Overall, the book was ok."
3,Imperfect Account,"The journey is invariably more interesting than the final destination. Knowing the eventuality and finality of this story in advance was distracting and detracting. The writing is somewhat stilted, sometimes slow and definitely too graphic in the end. For an excellent account on the life (as opposed to death) of deep sea commercial fishermen/women, read ""Working on the Edge""."
4,"Great Book, but it might keep you up a night!","This was a great book! The author does such a good job describing the town and the characters that you begin to feel bad for them because you know that at any page turn they could be in danger. Except for getting a little too detailed in the weather pattern descriptions, the book was great from start to finish."
3,Interesting stuff but VERY slow reading,"The author does a good job explaining everything, but the book is dry and makes it for slow reading. I would only recommend it if you're interested on the subject."
3,The Perfect Storm- A courageous and heartfelt story,"The story The Perfect Storm is a unique story about fisherman that try to make the catch out on the sea to provide their families and the towns people with fish.The Andrea Gail's Captain told the crew that he promised that they would see a lot of fish... and they did.As fate would have it three hurricanes collided in their tracks behind them and when they turned around to come home the STORM had struck.I was'nt too pleased with the book, because the writer chose to write more on the storm instead of the crew that was courageous enough to go back through it to get back to their families.I think that the writer could have also described a little more on the fishermen and the courageous efforts of the Coast Guards that tried to save them.This book does let you imagine what terrified thoughts the fishermen must have had, and the sight of those waves.If you get a chance watch the movie too!"
2,The Perfect Storm - Not a Beach Book,"I had to push on through the lenghthy description about winds and currents. I had no idea where the people were sailing and frankly didn't much care. The Andrea Gail is not the main point of the story, the STORM is. Way to much detail about boats which I found VERY dull. Too much details about water currents and wind currents.This book is not really a ""story"" as you might think. The book focuses on the STORM but I wanted to read about the people that were on the Andrea Gail since that is the boat where everyone perished but I wasn't even sure what the Captain's name was because the book jumped around so much. I would only recommend this if you're really into sailing and the sea."
2,"The book "" The Perfect Storm"" wasn't that great.","I read ""The Perfect Storm"" by Sebastian Junger and I didnt think it was that great. Every one is saying how it is so good but I didn't think so. I don't feel that the book was about the Andrea Gail. It was in the book but the author talks about fishing, drowning, waves, boats, and on and on. The books explains waves and how work and all about drowning, etc.It talks about lots of different boats and people that were ever involved in a storm at sea. I got bored reading a lot of the time and started of thinking about something else and couldn't follow it. The book just drags on. But when it talks about the Andrea Gail it becomes exciting. The book was alright. But I wanted to read it because it was about the Andrea Gail. But it talked about a lot of other stuff that just was not interesting to me."
2,DPorts review,"The novel ""The Perfect Storm"" by Sebastian Junger seemed like an interesting book when I choose to read it. The history of fishing that it gives and also the way it portrays the voyage of the Andrea Gail is captivating to some extent, however I have not really enjoyed reading the book. It is written very well and you can tell that the author spent a lot of time researching what happened during the storm and the history of fishing. One thing that I did like about the book is how the author goes back and forth explaining old and new fishing techniques and shows how many of them are very similar. I guess that this is a book that people should read because it does have a pretty accurate account of history but it really doesn't do it for me."
3,Ms.O book review Colin McKeefery,The Perfect Storm is a great book that tells a story about a fishing boat and the storm of the century.It takes place on Halloween which is kinda spooky. The main characters are the crew on the boat.The storm was one of the worst the National Wheather Bureau has seen to date.This true-story tragedy would be good for anyone who likes a thriller.I would give this book 3stars.
2,Another journalist trying to write a coherent book.,"I'm sorry, but I am tired of these bestselling nonfiction books that read like a bunch of newspaper articles strung together. Junger has an interesting topic here. But it is marred by a lack of overall theme and by constant digressions into one piece of trivia or another. I found passages in the book to be very entertaining, very interesting, but the whole doesn't stick together. You finish, and you scratch your head. What's the message? How should I think about what I've just read. And you are just blank. Kind of like when you go to a ""B"" movie. You've been entertained but there's no aftertaste & no thoughtful contemplation of the topic."
2,READ this book (don't listen to it on CD),"I have never seen the movie so I'm not swayed by those discussions. I listen to at least one book on tape a week and enjoy this format for most books. I found the history of the boat, weather patterns, etc. interesting and enjoyable. The book was OK. But to listen to it was completely confusing. Three quarters of the way through he starts introducing new people and just gives a tiny bit of history of them and soon you're lost as to who he's talking about. If you're actually holding the book you can flip back and check yourself but to listen to it you just have to plow forward. To dedicate so much of the book to one crew and then suddenly jump to several other boats and many other people was just plain confusing. There is some sailor language."
3,Terrys review,I think this book is good its not great but its good. I got this book for my english class because we needed to read a book. I have watched the movie so i wanted to read the book to see if it is the same or if it is different.So far it is the same.
3,"Not ""Into Thin Air""","The dust jacket of this book described the book to be as thrilling and suspenseful as Into Thin Air, unfortunately they were wrong. This raised the expectations for me and when the book fell short, my opinion all fell. The story is about a large storm off the northeast coast of the U.S. and the effect it had on a few boats and the Coast Guard that was sent out to rescue them. This is one of the few times that I can say that the movie version was much more entertaining the book, the author was not able to describe the storm in the way that they were able to portray it in the film. I just felt the writing was flat and the author was over matched in trying to tell such a fast moving and powerful story."
2,"Ok book, needs more detail","I think that the book is ok it should have talked more about the storm rather than the fishing industry itself. I also found it really hard to relate to, I know that when I read a book I put myself as if I am the character and with this book I found that very hard to do, I just could not get into it at all. It really does not get interesting till maybe the middle and even that isn't that great. I definately suggest the movie over the book."
5,Absolutely Fabulous,"At my last calculation, the average review of the book is 8.4, with more ""10s"" that any other rating. This book certainly deserves it. I'm not sure about the grammatical errors that were mentioned in some of the reviews, but I didn't find the book any less interesting because of them. As for the nautical descriptions being boring, I found that they helped me understand in a fuller way what these me (and any fisherman) might go through in an average day. It really made me appreciate land, to tell the truth. I urge Mr. Junger to continue his writing career; thus far he has fared well."
2,A focus on fishing details clouded the human tragedy.,"I read this book after just completing ""Into Thin Air"" and it's hard not to compare the two. While I learned much about the nature of deep-sea fishing on the east coast, I felt that the author devoted more pages than necessary to those details. Because of that, I felt the book had a clinical feel to it. I thought there'd be much more emotion associated with the gut-wrenching story hidden in its pages."
2,A Watery Snoozefest,"Following a trip to the top of Everest in ""Into Thin Air,"" I immediately plunged right into ""Perfect Storm,"" naively expecting the same kind of drama. How wrong I was. Like many other reviewers listed here, I found the author's annoying attention to technical detail to be very distracting from the story at hand. And many times, I forgot which boat I was on, who owned it and why we were being asked to care about it. All in all, a major disappointment. Better luck next time."
2,One of the most overrated novels around,"What is the appeal in a book that mostly uses in depth sailing terms and has very little actual action. Granted, the story itself has some appeal, but Junger spends most of the novel describing the technical aspects of the ships and of the fishing business.It wasn't until the end of the novel that it became quite captivating, but it was not worth wasting my time being bored by most of the book and interested in only about the final 30 pages."
4,"Powerful book, but much of the meteorology is all wet!","As a professional meteorologist this book was a frustration. The story itself is taut and exciting, but much of the meteorological information was simply wrong. The description of the forecast process was confused (the LFM is a computer forecast model not some kind of observational system) and description of the storm was inadequate at best. This was not as big a storm as the book implies.."
3,a little disappointing,"This is a great story line not done as well as it could have been. Slow to develop but the background was useful enough....it just didn't evolve like I hoped it would or should for such an event. As a reference, try ""Fatal Storm"" about the 1998 Sydney-Hobart race. It's a fantastic read about another ""perfect storm"". Very humbling."
1,Not worth the time,"I would not recommend this book to anyone that is expecting a good sea story. This book gets way to technical about the boat,the weather, and the fishing. I did not finish reading this book as it was not close to being as good as the movie."
3,Entertaining but...,The book does a good job with character development and is fun to read. It doesn't go into the realities of longline fishing by-catch.Most of the fish pulled in by the longline are dead. If they are too small or not what the fisherman are looking for then they are thrown back. 90 percent of the catch is by-catch thrown back dead in the water. The other part of the story that is inaccurate has to do with the sailboat rescue. You can find an alternative (real?) story of what happened online.
5,remembering the day,"I have known one of the young man on board this ship, and have been at his families home, and I am still in contact with his mother today, who lives in south hamilton, mass. I am deeply touched by this true story... as I remember so well... the day when we were told that he was missing... good work."
4,"Compelling, Well Worth Reading","How can anyone find this book boring? It's exactly the opposite, nonstop excitement from one end to the other. In contrast to several other reviewers, I found the ""technical"" discussions of fishing, weather and waves totally absorbing, a perfect introduction for a landlubber (and Midwesterner) like me. Junger even manages to bring the difficult economics of commercial fishing -- for both the individual fisherman and the industry as a whole -- to life in a way that volumes of statistics and government reports could never do. It's true that many other good books about ships and the sea have been written, but how many of them have been read and enjoyed by this many people? I rank ""The Perfect Storm"" high on my list of great adventure books. I hope that this book's popularity doesn't cause people to think it isn't worth reading."
5,A book you will not want to put down.,Excellent read for the reader who enjoys non-fiction adventure. If you enjoyed this book I highly reccommend The Hungry Ocean by Linda Greenlaw.
5,Remarkable book - terrifying story,"I enjoyed the book immensely, as a reader of action/adventure books and as a pleasure craft sailor.I was perplexed by seeming contradictions in the segment about Ray Leonard, owner of the yacht Satori. The abandonment of his vessel did not seem consistant with his background and experience. Satori was recovered by Mr. Leonard, beached and intact, with personal possessions still on the deck where they sat at the time of abandonment END"
4,A very good book but a slow start.,"This book is very good. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because it started out slowly.But after you pass the first 150 pages or so this book is very good. It gives a very good description of fishing life in the ninties. The description of the storm, drowning and everything else is very good. A must read."
3,Fact is stranger than fiction.,"One hundred foot waves. I've been out in ten foot waves and was happy to be alive when I returned.It was an incredible happening that would have been better as a work of fiction based on fact. There was little character development, so you were not as emotionaly attached to the crew and families as you could be. He had to fill in the gaps anyway, so why not go all the way. Still an amazing story."
1,I didn't care if they all went down,"A male relative told me this was one of the greatest books he ever read. I will never trust him onward. Sebstian is consumed with technical crap like wave heights, weather warnings, boat jargon, blah blah, and barely toches on character or plot. There were too many boats, too many crew members and helicopter pilots that were in trouble that you didn't get close to any of them. The best part of the book was the end (not just because it was over) but how he told the story of pulling information out of the local seadogs. Who cares. Boring!!!!"
1,"there's no ""there"" there","As a sailor I was looking forward to this well publicized book... It was a bitter disappointment. It is not a novel, nor is it novel. It isn't even a story... It is a description of events coupled with the author's best guess musings about what people who died might have done and thought in their last hours. My husband thinks, without bothering to read it yet, that maybe it's a book that would only appeal to men, but I wouldn't even have made it a book; at best, it should have been harshly edited down and published in a specialized magazine for people interested in commercial fishing by rather sad people."
1,"""Did Not Draw Me In At All""","Junger simply told me what was going on. He did not let me experience the events through the eyes of the crewmen. The characters did not come out as flesh and blood people. Junger also took too much time going into all kinds of historical and technical detail, most of which did not move the story along at all. I finished a third of the book and had no sense of drama, no sense of forboding and no care for the people on board. That's a darn shame!"
2,A major disapointment,"I found myself much more interested in numerous sub-plots than the main story of the doomed Andrea Gail. Much to much technical information is given on waves,clouds and boats for this to be a truely gripping read (I thought at one point I was back in school wishing I were somewhere else). This was however Krakauers er, Jungers first book and it appears that he does have a future."
2,Don't believe the hype...,"I had been planning to read this book for over a year and after hearing so much praise for it, I expected a lot. What a disappointment. Junger is extremely well-researched, but this doesn't necessarily make for an exciting read; at times I felt like I was reading a textbook. When he focused on the people, I was drawn in but when he spends 5 pages talking about weather patterns and how waves form it bored me to tears. Not a complete waste of time, but definitely not the ""nail-biter"" I expected it to be."
2,Good journalism but fair fact or fiction?,"Suspended between fiction and fact this account ultimately left me unhappy with key elements of the narrative. The disjointed nature of the timeline doesn't help, and one is left wondering at the author's interpretation of personal events. More transcrips of the survivors' stories may have helped turn a piece of journalism into a more subtantive piece of work."
2,Disappointing - reads like a meteorological/nautical text.,"The first quarter of the book was intriguing, with character development and a sense that the author was trying to get to know the sailors who perished on the Andrea Gail. For some reason, the focus of the book changes to the meteorological events that occur, the integrity of the ship's construction, nautical history, etc. I kept wondering, ""where are the people"". Maybe this is more a guy-type book. I was disappointed enough by page 150 that I decided not to finish it."
1,Most Over-rated Book Ever,"I had heard wonderful things about The Perfect Storm. I must be reading a different book under the same title! This is the most poorly written example of a supposedly non-fiction account. Do yourself a favor, read ""Into the Wild"" and ""Into Thin Air"" instead."
1,Disappointing read,"With all the hype over how great this book is, I was expecting a bang-up, well-written read that would transport me into the middle of a whistling, blowing storm, and subject me to the whistle and force of the 100-mph winds and the driving, horizontal rain (believe me, I went thru a few hurricanes myself). I was truly disappointed. The first half started out as a very well-written, engaging read about the lives of working-class Massachusetts fishermen who depend on the sea to make ends meet. But as the book progressed, it bogged down into repetitive, technical minutiae about the many different ways of going through a mega-storm. I could never feel connected with the characters in this book, especially those who went through the awful experience of a storm such as this. At the end, I came away with an empty feeling about this book."
2,Turtle-paced Beginning with Riveting Ending,"This book has no focus. It seems Junger didnt have enough information about the Andrea Gail's final moments to fill an entire book so he saved the ""Story"" until the end and fills up the first half with useless information about fishing that you really don't care about, unless you're a fisherman, of course. DONT LET THE COVER FOOL YOU. The cover has you think that the entire book is a page turner when, in reality, its the final few chapters that has your face glued to the book. My advice: Skip all the boring foreplay at the beginning and head straight for the money shot located at the end of the book; you'll read less and save a lot of time."
3,Dreadful Bathtub Literature,I enjoyed this book immensely but actually panicked in the jacuzzi while reading about the clinical aspects of drowning and wave dynamics. Read it only when warm and dry!
1,Tedious,"After hearing so much hype I determined that I should probably read this book. What a disappointment. It could have been a good book but page after page of tedious boring facts like ""they went into the bar for a drink, then they got in the car and went to the diner, then they went back to the bar, then they went back to the diner"".... and on and on. Ho Hum. Poor writing style. It just could not hold my attention, No doubt he had all the facts about the boats and the men right but it lost so much in the telling. Too bad. Mr. Junger doesn't even pass ""Writing 101"""
1,"""The Perfect Snore"" is a more appropriate title...","I'm on page 115 and have fallen into some sort of coma. So far the book's not much more than a technical guide to fishing boats and the history of the sad plight of several crews off the coast of Massachusetts. I keep waiting for something to happen. Even though I know what's going to happen, it somehow doesn't seem worth the finish. I think I'll go to the movies instead."
2,A Waste of a Good Storm,"Sadly, this reads as a well-researched but poorly visualised piece of journalism. Something that Rolling Stone might have commissioned then had second thoughts about. Despite the wealth of detail, there's just too little feel for what a storm at sea is like, and the he-man bits about the helicopter rescuers is like something out of Tom Clancy (I mean that as an insult)."
3,Great story could have been told better.,"In the last couple years I've read two other maritime disaster books: In the Heart of the Sea by Nethaniel Philbrick and In Harm's Way by Doug Stanton, and although this book was a fast read and engaging, I didn't find myself as involved with the characters as in the other books.Perhaps it was simply aptly titled. It was, to me, indeed a book primarily about a storm, more than it was a book about the people in it. Though they figured prominently in the telling of the story, the other two were stories of survival and death. . .this book read like it was just a story of a sinking."
2,"I don't feel that it can be compared to ""Into thin Air""","This book starts slowly then tapers off. It finally got interesting toward the end with a description of the storm itself. To compare it to ""Into Thin Air"" does the the latter a great disservice"
5,Excellent account of a devastating New England storm.,"An excellent account of the devastating 1991 stormoff Newfoundland and New England. A gripping truelife tale about how the raging storm impacted thelives of Gloucester, Massachussetts fisherman,their families and friends. The description ofthe rescue attempts by the Air National Guard issuperb.Only negative thought about this excellent book ishis gratitous comment about Democrats being happyabout the destruction of President Bush's homeon Walker Point, Maine (Kennebunkport).One of the best reads of 1997!"
5,The best kind of read: both entertaining and informative,"""The Perfect Storm"" is the most emotionally engaging book I've read since ""The Shipping News.""Like ""Into the Wild"" and Sheila Nickerson's ""Disappearance: A Map,"" ""The Perfect Storm"" is a heart-stopping, heart-wrenching story of improvident sparrows, ordinary people engulfed in extraordinary circumstances.Even for one who has little interest in being on the ocean, the book is hugely informative and entertaining. It's one of those stories you can't stop reading, even though you don't want it to end. ""The Perfect Storm"" deserves Pulitzer consideration"
5,The perfect storm -The truth,"This is the best book after Hemingway's "" Old man and the sea"" about the life of a fisherman , the Sea and the boats. The hard working , jurnalizam finaly made the the product which can put the writer on pedestal of us which plow the ocean for a living . This is the first to book not using the words telling the truth about particular happening. God bless Writer , god bless crew of Andrea Gail and they'r family's and loved ones. All of us who sail for a living been there , but do not talk about , to our loved ones can sleap without the worry's. Once again THANK YOU"
5,A Great Read,"In The Perfect Storm, Sebastian Junger delivers a vivid and gripping tale of man versus nature. In a swift journalistic style, he tells the story of a freak monstrous storm and the people who found themselves in its grips on the sea.In October 1991, three separate weather systems (an Arctic front, a low pressure system hurling eastward from the Great Lakes, and a powerful hurricane off the east coast) collided in the Atlantic Ocean. Unsuspecting crews on fishing boats, commercial vessels and pleasure craft found themselves in a vortex of exploding winds, torrential rains and towering waves.Junger describes their plight and their struggles to survive what meteorologists called ""the perfect storm."" He also details the various rescue attempts by the Coast Guard and Air National Guard. But The Perfect Storm is not merely an action-packed page-turner. It's also an intimate and moving tale of life, love, loss and survival that will make you wish this were just a movie."
2,Awash in an ocean of tangents...,"Man Against Nature is always an interesting topic and Junger certainly covers many aspects of it, but this story is unfocused and poorly edited. The ""Andrea Gail"" incident is only one of many loose threads covered in the detail-burdened narrative. A major storm is the picture of chaos - a book should not be!"
3,Exciting but confusing at First,"When I first starting reading The Perfect Storm, I i didn't quite understand what the author was doing. I literally had to go back and reread the first 5-10 pages to get and an idea of what he was doing with the time frames. While reading the book I had to keep telling myself that this was a true story, and from what I heard about it, it didn't have a happy ending, which is very unfullfilling. But it is a true account of these people lives and that is fulfilling enough. We live in a world were we are used to happy endings because of movies and so on. I thought the book WAS good but I also thought that there was a lot of unnecessary literature about fishing which I had a drag myself through, this is the main reason I only gave it 3 stars. I'm really looking forward to seeing the film."
3,Heavy on the technicals,"I found this work to be more-often-than-not confusing.I had a difficult time nailing all of the different elements of this novel down. I was unsure as to the time and place the different events were happening. The meteorological and oceanic and sea-vessel science made the book drag, and many ideas were developed for too long when they had no relevance to the story (Good writing can have as much science and irrelevant side-bars as it wants because it makes them transparent to the reader).Now, the power and fury of nature unleashed is interesting. So is the story of human survival against insurmountable odds.There is no question that the storyline is very engaging, but the writing sort of gets in the way."
3,Okay book - great ending,"The first half of the book is not so great. Too slow. Switches time periods too many times. I almost did not finish the book, but kept on reading. Once the storm hits the book picks up and is hard to put down."
5,detailed story of people who go to sea in a monster storm.,The author reveals every detail leading up to and including a monster storm.Life in the sea town is described in a style which reminds me of the stories of Jerry Bledsoe.
3,Man against the elements,"A fascinating look at the fishing industry and the people who work in it. Junger obviously put in a lot of research effort and, although there are long passages of the book that are ""factoidal"" and somewhat tiring, these segments do add to the reader's understanding of all the elements that make up this story--endless dissertations on weather patterns, the history of fishing and it's dangers and rewards in the Northeast, how it might feel to die of drowning, etc. I found the most interest in the operations of the Coast Guard. The training of the Jumper Pilots, the dedication to their work that drove them to risk (and in the case of one of them, lose) their lives in this storm is amazingly altruistic and humane. It took me a while to get through this book, but it was worth the read."
3,Enjoyable and interesting,"Not especially well-written but this is the kind of book where the writing doesn't especially matter. It's chockful of interesting facts, anecdotes and real-life (but seemingly fictional) characters. Although you already know the outcome of the storm, the book keeps you firmly in its grip. Don't bother with the movie---read the book!"
4,highly reccommended,"I have conducted oceanographic research for the last 10 years. This book accurately describes the exhiliration, passion and fear every sailor feels at sea. Junger skillfully presents the merciless world of the men and women who make their living from the sea."
3,5 stars? - You should read more - But a pretty good book.,"I enjoyed the book for what it was - an interesting read about a hellish storm and the people affected by it. As for it being marketed as a story about the crew of the Andrea Gail, it is VERY misleading. It's barely about them. I'd say that about 100 pages, tops, is about the Andrea Gail. Mr. Junger basically guesses on a topic as long as he possibly can, and comes up with some pretty exciting scenarios and facts along the way."
2,Perfect Marketing Plan but poor storytelling,"I find true stories of human hardship and endurance such as 'Into Thin Air"" compelling. But watch out when someone tries writes about a story to which there were no surviving eyewitnesses, such as the Andrea Gail sinking, ""into the Wild"" etc. This book goes off on tangents to fill space, such as how do we forecast storms, or how do longline fisherman live. But the actual story of the Andrea Gail crew is a thin thread, shrouded by conjecture. And the most dissapointing and telltale feature is the lack of authentic photographs in the book, substituted by cheesy set of glossy prints from the movie, with that ER guy. No, my imgination did not go anywhere with this.....but its making lots of $$ in the theatre."
3,A fascinating read,"This was a fascinating and enjoyable book, and I got through it very quickly. It is not particularly deep and the writing is hardly transcendent, but I don't think Junger intended to write a comprehensive analysis of this infamous storm and its effects. Instead, the book reads like an expanded version of the old saw that it's ""not nice to fool with Mother Nature.""Junger illustrates this concept by considering the storm on several levels: its effect on one group of fishermen lost in the heart of the storm, the hardships associated with making a living at sea in the North Atlantic, and technical details concerning the physics of waves, wind, storm tracks, and so forth, presented in a very accessible way for the layperson. As a geographer, this last point was especially interesting."
4,It was an enjoyable read.,"The early parts of this book dragged for me. While the people were interesting, I think Junger spent too much time on them. I was more captivated by the actual storm and rescue chapters."
2,Goot learnin but....,"Learned alot about the fishermen of the Grand Banks but, the sentences where so chopped up, it was like driving in stop and go traffic. ie: The boat arrives at the dock. The men get on the boat. The men check the hatches. The skipper starts the engine. The guys wave goodbye. The girl crys......"
2,Great tale but so poorly written!,I was very dissapointed after all the hype this book got. The subject is compelling but the quality of the writing almost kept me from finishing. There are quite literally hundreds of much better sea books out there. Kindof sad this one was so successfully promoted...
2,A whole chapter on drowning?,"A whole chapter on on the agony of drowning? Too technical for me----not enough dialogue. More of a ""guy"" book."
1,Good for insomnia!!!!,"I usually love adventure books of any type and was excited about this book until I started reading it. The cover exclaims, wonderful, exciting, can't put down! Yeah right! I have read this book for about two months and I'm still reading it. When does the good part come? I read it at night to get sleepy. I get through about 2 or 3 pages and I'm ready to turn off the light and go to bed. Save your money if you don't have insomnia. Try ""A Walk in the Wilderness"" or ""Into Thin Air""."
1,this book was the most doringest book i have ever read,I hated this book I kept waiting for the story to start. I had no interest in all that history. If I wanted a history lesson I would have read a history booik!!!!
1,hated it!!!,"one of the WORST books i've ever read in my life. i didn't want to read about history of swordfish or rescue man in Boston in 1800s or whatever those ... were. i was really disappointed about this book. it's nothing like the movie one. i wanted to give 2 or 3 stars cuz it has some reputation, but i just couldn't. so bad..."
1,The Perfect Storm,The Perfect Storm is a very good novel about man vs. sea. I will admit that the story starts off slow with drunken sailors and how they live. Once you get passed the background stories of all the characters and the slow opening you will really get into the book. With the action packed fishing stories and the non stop storm action you are guaranteed to get a thrill. The ending of the story is extremely sad knowing that none of the fisherman survived the horrible storm. When all of the sailors a bored the Andrea Gale died its sad remembering that they all have loved ones back at home who need them in some way.
2,Oddly detached,"After reading the mesmerizing ""Into Thin Air"", I had hoped that The Perfect Storm would be equally as engrossing. Unfortunately, it left me rather cold (no pun intended.) Although the research and level of detail about the fishing industry was interesting (and sometimes tedious), I never became emotionally invested in the characters. It's not just that they weren't particularly likeable, it's that they are always overshadowed by the sheer quantity of facts. Their struggle never became a gripping aspect of the narrative. It was almost as if the author didn't care for his characters as much as he did for the technical accuracy of his descriptions."
2,this is lightweight journalism,"Light on content, light on analysis, medium-to-light on characterization, all in all it reads like a not-very-good magazine article, inflated to book length. If it were fiction it would be without worth. As non-fiction there's an occasional thrill, but it should tell more than it does (I wanted to know more about the storm!) And as journalism the author fails to connect solidly with the story."
4,Unputdownable true sea adventure,"Drowning at sea hardly seems a book subject, especially since there were no survivors and the author makes nothing up. But, in a masterly first section, the author creates such empathy for the sometimes unlovely fishermen aboard the Andrea Gail that the reader is compelled into their world, the physiology of storms, and the triumphs and tragedies of rescue. A style to marvel at and a book to reread"
1,Horribly written,"After hearing much of the hype about this book, I bought a copy. After reading through almost half of it, I finally gave up and threw it against the wall. The writing was just abominable. I felt myself trying to concentrate on the story just so I could get through it. Slowly I realized that it wasn't worth all the pain. How this is considered a well-written book is beyond me. Don't believe the hype."
3,"Styron Praises ""Perfect Storm""","Last night at a reading given by honored American author William Styron (""Confessions of Nat Turner"", Sophie's Choice""), Mr. Styron was asked which books he had read recently which countered his observation of the trend in America away from the ""love of the written word"". He replied that ""Perfect Storm"" was a ""classic tale of man against the elements"", and he predicted that it was likely to become ""one of the classics"". He called the tale ""fascinating"". On the basis of my respect for Mr. Styron, I may give this book a try despite the lukewarm reviews herein; I suppose Faulkner might also have been occasionally tagged with the description ""boring"", and I'd be worse off in the world if I'd have let this criticism stand in the way of my discovery of his genius. Note that the ""5"" represents my lack of objective knowledge of this book, not my subjective reaction to it."
3,When it rains it bores,"When first attempting to digest the impact and possible significance of Mr. Junger's ""A Perfect Storm"" there was a moment of confusion which,unlike Mr. Junger's storm, cleared quite quickly and dramatically. Left in its wake was this feeling about the book and it's author: ""ain't been there, ain't done that.""With speculation fast becoming somewhat of a national pastime, perhaps the next bestseller of this genre should be ""To Di For"", the breathless, racy last moments in the lives of a princess,a playboy and a luxury sedan."
3,Cluttered at first but good technical reading,"The detailed description of what it's like to drown was the most probable I've read. The mechanics of big weather at sea - dynamicsof waves - was informative but not a copy of reference text either. Junger does right by the ""PJs"" by giving them credit for what it takesto do their job and the tough life of a fisherman. One of the most controversial parts is how junger reckons that less oil in the water is why the waves are getting larger due to lower surfacetension...."
3,Hmmmmmm,"Let's just say that S. Junger is able to recount an incredibly fascinating disaster from very little available information. Nevertheless I can not agree with the some of the other reviews, the book is not well written, or not what i expected. It is a mix between a trash novel (i love them) and a serious book (love them too), however it is neither nor. I would have liked to see the latter, but Junger chose to delve between the two, creating a book i feel is boring. Yes the story is gripping and some of the passages are superb, but that's about it. If you're interested in finding out what happened out there, buy it it won't let you down; otherwise....."
3,The Perfect Storm,"To be blunt, the book is overrated. The events that took place for the people involved is highly amazing, however, the book is way too technical(construction of boat, weather factors etc.). I found myself, not being a sailing expert, to be bored by the extent of technical info that is presented. Unless you are familiar with boating, I think you will agree. Summary-interesting story but an overkill on technical info."
