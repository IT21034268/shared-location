4,Dinosaurs,My 5 year old grandson loves anything to do with dinosaurs. This book helps him imagine just how big there were. The book was in great condition.
2,Not what I hoped for.,"I didn't realize there weren't any pictures in this book. Based on the cover I thought there would be pictures to go with the recipes. I thought the recipes were a little weird and they did not sound appetizing. The only thing ""bariatric"" about this book is that every recipe can be blended into a pure'. But any food in general can be turned into a blended meal just by throwing it into the blender. I didn't see any thing special about these recipes and with out a picture to go with it I have a hard time immagining what it should look like."
4,Good Mix of Recipes,I especially appreciate the serving guidelines provided for each recipe. It gives quantity and timeline by surgery type. The ingredients are not too exotic -- all things you can find in your local Safeway-type store.
4,Practical Recipes,"I didn't read it until a few months after surgery - the point when you need a new burst of recipes and energy to keep losing. I have tried a few of the recipies and the taste was great. I don't think I will keep some of their spices and ingredients on the shelf but this is a great resource for when I want to ""shake things up""."
4,Misprint in the index?,"I just received my new book. I was going through and putting Post it tabs on each section for convenience however, I noticed I was short a tab after counting the ""chapters"". The index goes from 1- Breakfast and Brunch 2- Soup it up 3- Vegetables, Not Just an Aside 4- Main Course SIX- Sweet Indulgences 7- Savory & Sweet Sauces. Is there a section actually missing (number 5), or is this a misprint? Anyway, can't wait to start cooking!"
5,Great book,I received this book and immediately had to try out a recipe! I tried the cauliflower (fake mashed potatoes) recipe and it is awesome! My family didn't know the difference!
3,Good if youre a chef,"I got this cookbook, thinking that I would be able to whip some quick things up. I am not a cook, nor do I enjoy it. So, the book is a little over my head.IF you like to cook, then this book is for you.I do like how at the bottom of each recipe, there are instructions about what stage of surgery you are on."
4,Recipes,I like this book but feel it should be only used after you've been cleared by the doctor for these foods. Mine did after 3 weeks. Dont think you can use these right after surgery.
5,Excellent Cookbook for Creative Recipes after Lapband Surgery,"My wife and I like this cookbook a great deal. At a time when virtually everything she likes was off the menu, this supplied some very practical menus and some insights on how to utilize spices and alternative ingredients to make dishes that are compliant with guidelines but taste good."
4,The Lap Band Chronicles thinks...,"This is one of the more sophisticated bariatric cookbooks I have come across. Not only does it contain very bariatric friendly recipes (high in protein, low in carbs and saturated fats), but it contains an entire introductory section that explains in detail all of the different types of weight loss surgery and how they differ in terms of dietary requirements. But that's not the best part. Each recipe is followed by a serving guide--not your ordinary serving guide. This guide explains exactly what size portions you can have of the dish at each stage of your surgical recovery. Amazing! The authors put a lot of thought into this book. The Tuscan Veal Stew recipe is luscious and so are many others. This one is a keeper. I give it three lap bands. I would have given it four if the book had pictures. For more, visit [...]"
4,bariatric recipie book,Pretty good book. Has many creative and tastey recipies for the bariatric plan requird after weight loss surgery. Another one that can be good on your counter and in your cookbook collection.
3,"Finally, A Book for DSers","I was pleased to see that this book included information for post-op Duodenal Switch patients. So often, this surgery is bypassed (pun intended!) in books. More and more people are choosing the DS, so having recipes that will work with this surgery is a must! Granted, DSers can eat most anything post-op, but it is helpful to see the different stages of eating that some surgeons recommend.I agree that the ingredient list can be someone expansive and most of us will not have all the spices on hand, but there are some tasty recipes in this book."
1,I know how to make an omelet,"I was hoping for a cookbook with basic, down-to-earth recipes on how to adapt everyday dishes for the post-surgical patient. This wasn't it. The recipes are either very rudimentary (I know how to make an omelet) or party-like dishes. Very disappointing."
1,Kindle version doesn't show all text,Looking for recipes to accommodate my new way of eating. Cant read the entire recipe because they are cut off. This is worthless to me.
5,Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!,I have been banded just over six months and I wish I had this book from day 1. The recipes are easy to follow and wonderful to eat. They have given me alot of my own ideas too. I can enjoy food again. Thanks!
1,SORRY I BOUGHT THIS BOOK,"IT WAS TOO MUCH DIFFICULTY IN PREPARATION OF MOST OF THESE RECIPES WHEN YOU NEED MORE EASE IN PREPARATION AFTER WEIGHT LOSS SURGERY. MANY OF THEM I THOUGHT WERE JUST STRANGE AND NOT APPEALING, SORRY!"
4,Good Experince,I purchased this book for my mom and it looks like she will enjoy it and be very helpful in her weight loss journey.
2,not helpful for lap band,I did not like this book's recipes. I have the lap band. A lot of the recipes are pork or seafood which I do not like. The other recipes like the meatloaf did not taste good. Just my personal opinion! Not good for lap band people.
5,LOVE THIS!,"I am going for the lap band procedure in 2 weeks, and this book gives me hope that there is a life of yummy healthy foods ahead of me! Thanks! :)"
3,Msc2974,"Very disappointed in this cook book. Although it broke down the recipes into what to do depending on the surgery you had, I didn't find it helpful for my needs."
5,Perfect for after surgery meal planning,My dietitian recommended this book and I am so glad she did. Everything is spelled out and easy to understand. The author even tells you when & how much you can eat of each recipe after surgery. Perfect for us weight loss surgery patients and their families.
4,Eating Well After Weight Loss Surgery,I purchased this cookbook for a friend and she has found it extremely helpful when planning her meals and working through her weight loss.
5,Not just for weight loss surgery patients!,"Potential buyers should know that this book's usefulness is not limited to those who have undergone weight loss surgery. It is also of tremendous value to people recovering from dental work or jaw surgery, where soft or liquid diets are of necessity for a length of time. As someone who has experienced this type of surgery, I can attest to the desire for flavorful meals, beyond what can be found in typical shakes, soups and purees. This book is the answer.The recipes are varied, well-written, and most importantly, produce delicious results. Patt Levine has done an amazing job of creating a valuable resource for people who have gone through a trying physical ordeal, and now long to resume a sense of normalcy. Since so much of our lives revolves around what we eat, this book is a must-have!"
2,not worth it,"The only way a person could afford to eat from this cookbook is if they one the lottery. On average I would spend 200-300 dollars a week in ingredients. Half of the recipes were poorly written, especially for someone who doesn't have much cooking experience. There are no pictures so it's hard to see what the final product is supposed to look like. I would find another cookbook."
2,No Photos,"I did not receive any photos with this product. I am still going to be able to use the recipes, but it is sometimes helpful to see a photo before trying to cook something."
3,Eating healthy after weight loss surgery,While this book is good in the fact it helps us work toward getting more Protein in our bodys it was not good for me as in the area we can not grocery shop for a good deal of the ingredients asked for in this book to make the recipe turn out right. While a good deal of thought went into it apparently no one thought about the ingredients and if they would be readily available to those who wish to try the recipe's inside.
2,Not for the everyday Cook,"Unless you are a gourmet cook , this book is not for you. Unless you are an ardent mushroom lover , this book is not for you. Many of the rcipes were complicated, timecinsuming and needed expensive ingredients not found in the ordinary every day pantry.I would not recommend this product to the novice"
3,I'm not a gourmet cook!,"I found the recipes to be difficult and the ingredients hard to find. Also, the authors recommendations for when to advance from liquids to mush, to soft, etc did not follow my surgeons. One has to keep in mind her recommendations are more guidelines and you should always follow your doctor's. I did like that fact that she has had surgery and could relate to some of the difficulties."
4,Fascinating read,"The same mix of philosophical musing and sexploitative artwork continues to be a pull in this manga series. Let's not kid ourselves or others. Without the latter, this series would not have been as commercially successful. Comprising some shorter pensive stories, the two longer stories here are quite surprising. The first involves Asaemon in diffusing a volatile situation by agreeing to a marriage proposal. The final outcome also was a surprise. The second long story involves an erotic tale of a woman with an ugly tattoo on her back. She is nicely drawn here, though. The depictions are not suitable for the young. So far, the artful depictions of this nature indicate that the artist was pandering to the expectations of his audience."
1,Outdated!!,"I purchased this video because my 20 month old son loves Clifford. Well, the Clifford in this video is really just a person in a Clifford costume and looks nothing like the character. It is also clear that this video was made a very long time ago (15 years), with poor production & props and terrible acting. The only reason I gave it a score of ""1"" is because for some reason my son likes it :) I should have read the other reviews!"
4,Clifford the Big Red Dog: Clifford's Singalong Adventure VHS,"While it may be difficult for parents to rate this video high, children LOVE it! I have three grandchildren and I'm buying a second copy for them to have at home because that's all they want to watch when they come over. They'll watch it over and over singing and dancing. They are ages 1, 2, and 4."
3,No More Renting!,"I can't agree more with reviewer AKT. This is such a hokey production. It's embarrassing. But my 3 year old daughter has LOVED this video for a year. She sings. She dances. Even trying to breakdance like the boys in the video! Definitely ""interactive"".I'm glad we finally found this video to purchase."
2,Deceptive...,"We were very disappointed with this video~ althoug it appeared to be a good ole' clifford video, it was in fact, something quite diffent. there is very little of clifford and a lot of rather annoying singing by some dippy guy in a tie...what's going on?"
4,Plenty of horrors,"I have all the Amityville movies for my collection and thats why I purchased these ones from over seas as I couldn't but them here, I still enjoyed the shows and they are all different from each other, Like horrors worth watching."
3,AMMITYVILLE COLLECTION DVD USED,THE MOVIE ITS SELF IS BASED ON A TRUE STORY!! I HAD TO PICK A DOCUMENTARY SO I BOUGHT THIS COLLECTION VERY DISSAPOINTED I SPENT $14.99 FOR THE COLLECTIONS FROM THIS COMPANY ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT 2 DVDS OUT OF THIS COLLECTIONS R COPIED DVDS NOT ORIGINALS AND THIS COMPANY SHOULD HAD STATED THAT WHEN THEY SOLD THIS SET!! VERY DISSAPOINTED IN THE COMPANY AND THE BOX THE COLLECTION CAME IN1111 I HAVE SEEN USED SETS IN BETTER CONDITIONS! SO U TAKE YOUR CHANCES ORDERING FROM THIS COMPANY. KC
5,Amityville box set,I am very happy with the Amityville horror box set I liked the movies very much I glad I brought them. Charles
2,Disappointment,"I'm a fan of ghost stories and of the original Amityville Horror movie. Thinking this was just the first sequel and made not long after that, I had higher expectations. First off, the name is confusing as you eventually figure out that this is the prequel to the first movie, not a sequel.Most of it is just plain ridiculous. I also found the incest to be a little disturbing, and not in a good horror movie kind of way. Like an I want my brain scrubbed out kind of way. Then somewhere towards the end, the author lifted the plot of The Exorcist making for predictability and disappointment. Don't waste your time or money with this one and just watch the original if you get the urge."
4,"OH! The Horrors, The Horrors!","What a great deal! The original ""Amityville"" with a new transfer and sound mix, the prequel, and the lame 3-D Amityville all in one box. PLUS a bonus disc. More horrors than a Vincent Price Fan Club Reunion, this is truly a great way to get your ghostie-goulie groove on. Just as cheesy, but still a thrill. Also comes with a pass to see the remake with Ryan Renyolds."
2,Not scary at all!,"I'm a big fan of horror and suspence movies, and this one really disappointed me. It didn't scare me at all, and the make up of the deads was poor. And it didn't kept me in suspence in any way.I didn;t like it at all"
4,"Lots of fun,scares and camp.","This is a fun clloection for mostly the die hard fans. It includes the first AMITYVILLE which has some geniuine scare. The number two film is pre-equal and based loosely on the tragic Defeo massacre, this particular flick has many chills and subversive elements. Film number three is the reason this collection only got a 4 star rating. Its awful it was originally released in 3D and has nothing to do with anything. The collection is redeemed by AMITVILLE CONFIDENTIAL, which includes behind the scenes of the remake and two compelling HISTORY channel documentaries HOOROR OR HOAX and HAUNTING. They both pretty much leave the viewer to decide or not if they believe. This a handsomely packaged collection at a great price."
2,Super-slow documentary of a less promoted female surf champion,"Not your usual surf film. If you are just looking for lots of waves, fun music and great maneuvers, this is not the film for you. The film goes through a daily routine of professional (yet unsponsored) surf champion Pauline Menczer with other female surfers, and makes a great point that it is completely wrong that a female surfer of this caliber has not received a sponsor. It demonstrates the lack of support for women's as compared to mens surfing. Unfortunately, between the lengthy unnecessary off-beach scenes and the annoyingly feminine commentary, it was difficult for my husband and I to sit through, unlike the other 20+ quality surf films we own. I will most likely give it away, but at least it made a good point."
3,Probably suitable for kids under 8,"Got this hoping it was more detailed than a video I bought previously (""Look Mom, I Have Good Manners""--which I liked overall better than this item) and discovered it covered pretty much the same topics. I was looking for something more sophisticated, I suppose. My eight year old watched politely and we agreed that it seemed pretty flat and unimaginative. It addresses topics such as basic table manners, good sportsmanship, and how to answer the phone politely, but honestly, it was pretty lame (what's with the crudely animated dog parroting the answers to the quiz?) despite the game-show format, which could have enlivened it considerably. I won't be going to the trouble and expense of returning it (I used my Amazon Rewards bucks to purchase it, so it was essentially free), but maybe I can pass it along to a family with younger kids."
2,My 4yr old could able to answer 99% of the scinario questions,"I bought with a view to get overall grasp of the manners. BUT it covers mostly table manners. The other ones are cheap shots. My 4 year old could able to answer 99% questions. Unless your child do know basics of social manners, I don't think it is worth buying it."
3,So so,"My kids did not like the format of a quiz show. It does cover topics, but could not hold my kids attention. 4 boys (12, 10, 6, 4)"
4,Beautiful Ending!,"This is a unique love story and any faults that it may have are brushed aside by the last moments. This is how many loves develope, not the usual Hollywood formula. I first saw this film more than 30 years ago, and I still remember it fondly. Enjoy!"
3,Water,"Most of the words in the sub-title were truncated, which made it difficult to follow and you could not enjoy it. I wanted to recommend this movie to friends, who are non-Indians, but won't. I also wanted to buy copies to give as gifts but changed my mind.Thank you for giving me this opportunity.T. Thakordeen"
3,Blasphemy,"Don't you dare mention this film as comparable to Pather Panchali. The similarities are superficial and end there. It's like comparing Pee Wee's Big Adventure to The Bicycle Thief because they're both contain bikes.Don't get me wrong, it's beautifully shot and our heroes are just so darned pretty and we really really hope they get together. But all in all it's a predictable story that pushes some buttons. Having strong emotions because the director told you to is not the same as discovering those same emotions in the presence of great art. Seeing the injustice of 12-year-old brides makes me feel sad. But it's not the same depth of sadness I feel in the pivotal scene in Satyajit Ray's perfect and poetic film.Bottom line: It's good melodrama and an OK way to spend a couple hours, but it's effect is shallow and fleeting."
5,Good,"Loved it - not everyone likes these kind of films, so I wouldn't recommend it broadly, only to people I thought would enjoy it"
1,disappointing and cliched,"The cinematography is gorgeous, everything else is terrible.The premise is cliched. The acting by our two ""good lookingheroes"" horrible and wooden. Did anyone notice that the""widow problem"" is dated to 1930s in India. There are goodguys and bad guys in the movie and no shades of grey. The greycharacters were not given room to develop. I hadheard much about Deepa Mehta, but I was disappointed."
3,"A video clip about India, 1938","The story doesn't make sense, but it isn't the focus of the movie. THE FOCUS is to show the costumes, put the screen full of colors and this part is well done. Beautiful images, great pictures, good music. Perhaps the director's goal was to be nominated for the Oscar prizes. And it was. Goal achieved. The story is poor, boring, predictable."
1,I Felt Like I had a Nightmare after Watching the Movie,"I thought the movie was among the most disturbing films I have ever seen. Although there is not much gore and nudity, the film would have easily been rated R for the language if it was actually in English.Although I feel it probably does misrepresent Hindu culture, I have different qualms about the film.The ENTIRE movie is heartbreaking and there is NO positive resolution. I think Sophie's Choice is a softer movie. Very few films I can think of other than horror films could match the amount of disturbing story contexts this movie presents.I had to watch this movie for a class and am SUPER glad I did not waste my money on a film I may have watched for beauty that was obviously very ugly at the core.Save yourself a few hours of agony and do not see the movie."
1,A dishonest movie,"This is a dishonest movie made by Deepa Mehta. This movie was made with prejudice and innuendos and on lies. Why is this a dishonest movie? Imagine some anti Christian makes a movie based on the LDS and their penchant to have sex with little girls and then project that as Christian culture and character of christians. Now, Imagine such a movie is presented to the non Christian world and they all believe what a horrible religion Christianity and christian people are on how they treat little girls. Although such a story may be based on facts, the lie is the extrapolation of such exceptions to the overall group. Such unfair treatment of widows is somewhere close to 1% of 1% of people there. This is not the culture of Hindus at large. IF you want to see an honest and wonderful movie pn the same subject (Widows) , check out ""Dor"". Now, that's a movie to watch and learn about the same issues while being entertaining. Just read the reviews on that movie."
5,Extraordinary,"The moment this film ended, I e-mailed all my friends and family to urge them to watch it. Everything about this movie is five stars -- the story, the acting, cinematography, music. It was a privilege to behold. The child actor is astonishing. I was hardly aware I was reading subtitles, this film is so visually captivating.If there were 10 stars to give this film, I would."
4,Indian cinema,Anyone who enjoys Indian cinema. Bollywood cinema or just a study of humam nature and situations will find this movie compelling.It shows a woman struggling for her dignity and self worth against enormous odds.
2,WATER,I bought this cd but I cannot play it on my dvd player because IT IS IN A DIFFERENT ZONE. Probably for use in the USA but not in Europe. There was no indication that is was not in a Europe zone so I am disappointed. I would warn others to check the zone but I hope you have more luck than me because I CANNOT LOCATE WHERE IT GIVES THIS INDICATION. I have bought other dvds and I have been able to apply them with no problem.
5,Water - DVD,"Nowadays moving along with technology, not many people would own a CD of music or DVD of film...It's a shame that people don't treasure much about PHYSICAL products... therefore I had difficulty locating a supplier for this film. With Amazon, a click of a button (well, a few more clicks to pay and seal the purchase) one of my favourite films of all time arrived at my post box without any fuss. Superb quality in both service and the actual product. A wonderful trimuph to the World Cinema. Thanks to Amazon"
5,Double moral crime!,"For five years, extremist groups launched a campaign to discredit this movie, death threats, fires and ferocius disturbances to prevent this movie was made.But, against all the odds and assuming the risks involved, Deepa Mehta decided the world was aware this reality is still running.A haunting story that meets two women of different ages, one of them is an eight years old and the another one is still in her early twenties, both of them united by a same cause, they' re widows.According the ancestral codes, both must live for life a sort of perennial isolation as well as any chance to reconstruct their lives. When her husband dies, the half of them are dead too.So, in this context of prejudices and sacred precepts, between both of them a warm friendship will emerge, but tragic and dark clouds will hover over both to change their lives irrevocably.Remarkable, superb and potent film of this brilliant, talented and sensitive filmmaker.Do not even think for a moment to miss it."
3,average,"Simon Pulse Romantic Comedies are always a fun read. These books are not necessarily the best written novels but the stories are always fun and you know you will get a happy ending. I think some adult romances could take a note from these books b/c they are characterized well which is much of the battle in writing any novel since you want your characters, for the most part, to be endearing and relatable."
3,Different,"Reviewer: A reader from Sydney AustraliaI first read this book when I was 18 and have read it a number of times since then. I had to continually put this book down to wipe away the tears, it moved me that much, and I still get emotional even after numerous readings. The story of Addie's amazing strength and courage is incredible to read and impossible to put down, and I think anybody will be able to relate to Addie's profound sense of isolation. Truly a triumph of a novel.I agree with this review. Addie's story is very touching and very easy to relate with. Addie was my favorite character, and was the only personal aspect of the book that I enjoyed. I did not enjoy or understand the rest of the book. i just wonder why the author would write about something like this. Is it a situation that played a part in her life? Or someone else's. This isnt my type of book but I still agree with the the strength and courage that Addie's had."
1,Damaged,"Upon arrival, the cover of the book was dirty, torn in the seam corner and the back had a sticky, glue like substance on it that wouldn't come off. I ordered this book as a gift and am very disappointed in it's condition. I put it in the return mail as soon as I opened it. Time to shop for a new gift!"
3,Two in a row,"The last two cd's by the legendary Temps have been less than average. Like I said, it's just average."
1,Disappointing CD,"If you consider yourself a Temptations fan, you may skip this one. Track 2 was the only good song on the entire CD. This is NOT a repeat of Phoneix Rising's greatness.As a second generation Tempts fan, I have heard their best and this ain't it!So get Phoneix Rising if you don't already have it. And for the vintage Temptations sound - get one of their anthologies...Emperors of Soul is a good 5 cd set, if you can find it."
3,Definitely No Phoenix Rising!,"This album is ""so-so."" If it were not for them being the Temptations, it would be dissapointment of the year. The singing is true Tempts, but some of the songs are questionable. After all, after ""Phoenix Rising"", whats left? No one could follow up that album. ""For Lovers Only"" remains my runner up to Phoenix Rising. Buy it only if you are a Temptation's lover. Otherwise you will be dissapointed."
1,ilike the new teamtation,i like they last cd they did back in 1998 with was phonesy rishing my favon son was this is my promise to you and my love also give you my heart. and this album is the bomb because i listen to my cd every night while i'm trying to go to sleep at night .
2,Where's The Husky Voice???,"I have been a huge Temptations fan since the early sixties. The lead singer has always had a distinct rough quality (David, Dennis, Ali-Ollie) in their voice. The lead on this disc has the more recently popular soul sound - too smooth and nasal. It's OK for Boys to Men, Back Street Boys or N Sync, but I expect the Temps to sound like the Temps. I was disappointed in this disc. I hope things change in the future."
2,My Ears Found This One Very Resistable,"As a Temptation's fan for over forty years, I was quite dissappointed by this Grammy winner. I found the tracks to be mediocre at best. It seemed to me that they just rushed to get something out. The Temptations have set a standard over the years that I have come to expect them to live up to. This is a sad follow up to Pheonix Rising. I don't think Temps fan get any more hardcore than I do. I think they are the greatest group of all time, yes even over the Beatles and Elvis. But this one left me flat. But I still love the Tempts, everybody is entitled to one mishap."
4,An Ear-Resistible Temptation!,"Still going strong and never losing power! The Temptations have once again proven that the older you get the better. These classic musicians haven't lost their flavor. This new cd keeps in tradition with the Temptation flavor, and yet still keeps up with todays tempo. My favorite ""Kiss Me Like U Miss Me"" is a mood setter with its dramatic bass and smooth melody it is guaranteed to get someone into serious trouble."
2,Passable listening for the tired.,The album would me to sleep if I were ready to go to sleep in the middle of the afternoon. I wouldn't have to be raining outside.
4,*Big sigh*,"There is no doubt that these guys CAN SING, but my MAJOR gripe is whomever WRITES for them needs to REMEMBER that these men are MATURE in age and NOT 20-something!!! The cd is ok, but when I hear them sing a lyric that they are too old to be singing, I cannot take them seriously.Other than that, there are some decent tracks. Not a total disappointment. Legacy is better though :-)"
2,You need to get wet.,"Bought this one for my wife. She tells me that many of the excercises need to be done in a pool. Sadly, we do not have access to one."
4,Heal Your Knees,"This is an excellent book for those who have knee problems. Word of warning however. There are places where it is a bit of a heavy go when this man who is a doctor gets into his ""doctor speak"". That being said, if you persevere and continue reading he does a good job of explaining himself. I have found his suggestions to be helpful and I have reduced my pain using this book."
5,The Best,Easty to read. Informative. Good exercises that were explained in detail for both land and water exercises. Anyone with knee problems should read this book. It also allayed some of my fears regarding knee surgery as he explained what to expect.
5,CD Information,"JOHN BULL (1562-1628)Music for Harpsichord (Musik für Cembalo)01. In Nomine IX02. The King's Hunt03. Queen Elizabeth's Chromatic Pavan and Galliard05. Dutch Dance06. Fantasia XII07.

2,meh,"i was recently diagnosed w/ gestational diabetes... thus began my quest for a yummy protein bar... this isn't it. i'm giving it 2 stars because my blood sugar levels were within the desired range after having it as a snack. i'm going to try the other flavors, but this one definitely is not one i'd like to have again."
4,Excellent meal replacement bars.,"I usually get the white chocolate chocolate bars but mis-clicked and got these instead. It was a good change of pace.The chocolate crunch was good and chocolatey. I don't always have time for lunch and they filled in very well with a high protein ""desert"" instead of normal food.I like all of the non-sugar think thin products that I have tried."
3,diet thin bars,Not quit as good they where dry not sure how old they were first order wasnt to bad but second order might have been a little old might
3,"Okay, but no better than that","These are edible enough - a very mild peanut flavor to the rather cakey center, with a not very chocolate-y coating on the bar. I ordered them along with a box ofQuest Bar 100% Natural Chocolate Peanut Butter, and find I prefer the taste (though it's still not that strong) and texture (very chewy) of the Quest bars. Also, the Quest bars have 150 calories, 45 calories from fat, and 17 grams of fiber to the Think Thin bars' 240 calories, 80 calories from fat, and 1 gram of fiber. I find the two bars equally filling - and the Quest bars' all natural ingredients are also more appealing.No more Think Thin bars. It's the Quest bars I'm reordering - in several different flavors."
1,Surprise coconut flavor,"I buy several of the Think Thin bar flavors - tried this one and found, to my dismay, that it has a pronouonced coconut flavor, which is okay if you like coconut. Flavor is darker, but muddier, and ingredients list a fractionated palm kernel oil, which is not in the other bars I buy. Would not purchase it again."
3,World War II combat novel. Good but not great,"Harry Brown worked for one of the Army publications during World War II. ""A Walk In The Sun"" was a very early novel to come out of the war. Set in Italy, it is the story of a small combat unit on a special mission. Owes a lot to ""The Red Badge of Courage,"" but no where near as good. Brown went on to become a screenwriter in Hollywood."
2,A platoon on a questionable mission in WWII Italy,"I did not find the book as engaging as others like Home Before Morning, The Face of a Hero and certainly The Red Badge of Courage. I didn't end up caring desparately about the people. As an aside, the book paper and design are strictly mass-market paperback. Not much for $10."
4,Dated but Credible,"This book was published 40 years ago. There are only a few color sections, such as bayonet knots, should patches and a couple of camouflage patterns. The rest are all black and white photos with some line drawings. There is solid information here and you will find some interesting photographs. I still give it four stars despite its lack of color pictures of uniforms and equipment. The book is that good."
5,THE GREATEST THRILLER EVER WRITTEN,"THE ZION CHRONICLES AND THE ZION COVENANT, ARE THE MOST FASCINATING BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ.THE AUTHOR DOESN'T LET YOU PUT DOWN THE BOOK, EVEN FOR 1 SECOND.I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO INTERESTED IN HITLER'S STORY OR WHAT HAPPENED IN JERUSALEM UNTIL I READ THESE BOOKS.VIENNA PRELUDE IS SUCH A WONDERFUL BOOK, THAT I EVEN CRIED WHEN THEY WOULD TELL ALL THE UGLY STORIES OF HOW MANY PEOPLE WHERE SENTENCED TO LIFE AS SLAVES OR JUST SIMPLY NOT GIVEN ANY MORE RIGHT TO LIVE. I MEAN NOBODY HAS THE POWER (EXCEPT GOD) TO GIVE THAT RIGHT AWAY!!!!ELISA IS SO FULL OF LIFE AND SHE HAS A WONDERFUL LIFE WITH ALL HER FRIENDS AND LEAH OF COURSE! BUT EVERYTHING GOES WRONG WHEN HITLER STARTS HIS UGLY WAYS OF ""GETTING RID OF JEWS"".ELISA WAS ALMOST KILLED, RISKING HER LIFE TO HELP OTHERS ESCAPE THE PRE WORLD WAR II AUSTRIA.AGAIN, THIS IS THE GREATEST THRILLER THAT I HAVE READ IN MY LIFE"
2,Not Enough Story,"I think I gave it a fairly decent chance to captivate me. I waited, and read up to page 111 when I decided I was done with it. And the words are small font so 111 pages should have covered a lot of story, more so than the average book.In this book, history is the main character, so I read a lot about that period, the laws, the landscape, the people, etc. But, I still felt like I didn't know the characters very well. And I also must say there is one main character (beside history) but another character who is close behind. So far the book was from three different character's point of view. Which, sometimes really works (Francine Rivers) but when you throw in tons of historical facts, it leaves you lost and bored. So, needless to say, I am putting it down -unfinished."
5,Just finished an amazing book,"Recommended by Mrs. Brooks, it is a little frightening that we can make so many parallels between 1936 and today. Great read."
5,Another Great Series' Start,"This is a very interesting first book in this series (Zion Covenant). The Thoene's characters are fictional, but the history contained in this and their other books is very accurate. Great character development."
5,"Vienna Prelude I have reread Vienna Prelude, something I almost never do is reread a book, but again this was worth the time.","I would recommend this book to any one that wishes to take a good look at what really occurred during that time, I believe we as a nation should consider the reason why we waited so long to go to war."
4,WWII historical fiction that teaches & entertains,"We were introduced to this series by Carole Joy Seid who firmly believes in historical fiction as an excellent teaching tool. The Thoene's brought WWII, the Nazi political party, the ignorance of many, the depth of evil in men's hearts and the horrors of the time into the hands of the reader. The reader will have an intimate viewpoint of the experience of the victims of the Nazi party. The Thoene's are unsurpassed in their personal qualifications for producing a work of historical fiction - readers will be educated and entertained."
5,Super Well Researched,"If you are into pre World War Two books, then I would highly recommend Bodie & Brock Thoene. When you read their books, it's almost like you are right there, in Germany, back almost eighty years ago. By the way, this is only Book 1 - there are 8 more in the series.Vienna Prelude is about Elisa, who is blond haired and blue eyed and her WWI hero father Theo. Against all appearances, they are Jewish. The book describes the hardships of living in such a time where the Nazis have the power of life and death, of hope and despair, of peace and of war."
1,Might as well be Fraud,"If you are considering buying this item....DON'T!!!! My dad bought them after we bought our Xbox off my friend. They were brand new and with in not even a week after we got them they had many issues. It seems that even the smallest wireless signal can interfere and disrupt it causing the receiver and the controller to lose connection. Plus to top it all off one of my cat knocked it off of a little table I have and it's not very high about maybe an inch off the ground? I went to pick it up and the battery cover was broken, the upper left joystick was broken, and it wouldn't turn on anymore; the batteries were brand new so I know they were not the issue with the power. This isn't worth any price at all. They are cheap and crappy, if I would have known this is what my dad was looking at I would have told him to go with Pelican, they have never failed me once. So I recommened you go spend your money on something else this is definetly not worth it."
2,"Nice Design, poor implementation. Really bad reception.","I bought these controllers because I thought I would save myself some $. It was about $40 for both when I could get another brand for $40 for a single controller. The design [form-factor], and are a bit smaller than the standard controller. I don't like the placement of the back and start button. Also vibration is really, really weak compared to the standard type-S controller. My biggest vice is that the controller's lose their connection all the time, which is really annoying when playing because you mess up all the time in the game just because the controller goids out."
3,"Decent Controllers, Good Price","I bought these because they came with two wireless XBOX controllers for about the same price as you could get a new XBOX brand controller with a wire. They are okay for the average gamer, but lack at times. One of the controllers that came in the pack I got has a very insensitive left thumb stick. When playing Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, there are two speeds: run and not run. This is very frustrating when trying to sneak up on someone. The other controller works alright. A cool feature is that the controllers go to sleep after 2 minutes of inactivity. That saves some battery power. The controllers are nice and compact, and the buttons are all positioned in good places. I recommend these for someone looking for a decent, cheap pair of wireless controllers, but not someone looking for a precision controller for serious gaming."
5,Excellent book,"This is the best fly tying I have purchased since getting into fly fishing. It has great pictures and easy to follow recipies for lots and lots of flies. Everything you need to know book, this is it."
2,Overcasting at it's Finest,"This is a perfect example of overcasting and further proof that even the greatest actors can't save a poor screenplay. If you've seen the preview, then you've essentially seen the film -- minus 2 hours of emoting. Think the script of House of Sand and Fog meets the cast of 2006's All the King's Men. (4/10)"
1,Reservation Road,Reservation RoadThis DVD is defective. It's counter is off......it starts at the end of the movie and it takes forever to rewind to get to the beginning of the movie......if you go even a second to far it goes back to the end. I have never had this happen so I didn't get a refund as I had thrown out the receipt and package. I then went to Blockbuster and bought this movie and the exact same thing happened. Defective. Once you do get it to the start the movie itself is excellent a 4 out of 5 stars.....but your much better off renting this one than buying it.
3,One-Man Show/One-Note Song,"Joaguin Phoenix convincingly portrays Ethan Learner, whose son is killed by a criminally negligent driver who flees the scene. Phoenix is an Everyman who is confused, outraged, and vengeful. He becomes obsessed with the thought that the driver will get away with it because the police are not working the case hard enough. He decides to investigate himself. He goes on the Internet seeking others who have been similarly victimized. There is nothing artificial or contrived about his performance.The rest of the cast seems to follow directions well. They are all clearly competent actors. But there is a lack of conviction. Their performances seem forced.The film held my interest, but I would not use words like ""compelling"" or ""gripping"" to describe it. It's basically a one-note song: a weak man tries to escape justice."
3,Too bad about the ending,"When a child is killed in a hit and run accident, both his grieving father, Ethan (Joaquin Phoenix), and the guilt-ridden killer, Dwight, (Mark Ruffalo) suffer horribly. Things get even worse when Ethan hires Dwight to solve the case.The first 90 minutes of the movie were very good. The anguish of both father and killer was intense and obviously building to an emotional climax. The actors blew it in the final scene, however; neither actor had the depth to convey the misery the script demanded. The great build-up fell flat with shallow and unconvincing acting. Another problem was that the two male leads looked too much alike; they had to give Phoenix a bushy lumberjack beard so we could tell them apart and it was distracting. Also, Jennifer Connelly was never believable as a devastated mother; in fact, her reaction when the child died made me assume she was his step-mother.This is a disappointing movie."
3,Hit and Miss,"Such a strong premise, but what a weak delivery. There was no chemistry between the cast, Phoenix couldn't have been more miscast, and the plot oversights couldn't have been bigger. For such an intensely tragic event there is virtually no emotional expression, and what little there is comes across melodramatic. Not a particularly strong film for its own merits or as a vanity piece for any of the cast members."
4,Stand out performances!,I believe this movie will make any parent cringe. A young boy is killed in a hit and run accident and it shows how the parents deal with the loss and what the man who hits the child goes through.While the plot at first reminded me of a lifetime movie the actors and actresses made all the difference in this movie. Joaquin Phoenix and Mark Ruffalo give stand out performances in this movie. For me they presented themselves like I have never seen them before. The emotion Joaquin gave in his performance was unbelivable. Even the two child stars of the film gave great performances and added to the chemistry of the film.Great movie with wonderful performances!
4,Incredible Performance by Mark Ruffalo; Not so much for the rest,As a father I found this movie almost difficult to watch at times due to its honest and raw portrayal of the loss of a child. Mark Ruffalo turns in a truly incrdible performance I thought and shows a whole new side of his acting that we haven't see in his other performances. The rest of the cast I wasn't as impressed with. Jennifer Connelly was either not given any direction or didn't have enough material to work with other than to look sad. Joaquin Phoenix I've enjoyed in his other roles but I didn't find him very convincing in this film. His dialogue and performance felt forced and unnatural.
3,nothing new,"Reservation Road. Where a child, Josh Learner, was killed in a hit-and-run. The story of the father Ethan (J. Phoenix), trying to get justice in his hands because the cops aren't finding who did it. So he hires a lawyer Dwight Arno (M. Ruffalo) to help him with his case.........Nothing new here. That story has been done many many many times. However, the acting is superb, I really enjoyed Phoenix for once, and Mark Ruffalo is just great. Jennifer Connelly as Ethan's wife is perfect.The script makes the events a little too ""coincidental"" for my taste. And the story was pretty predictable.Still worth watching once."
4,OSCAR material,"Sometimes the sad things in life make the best movies. All characters were excellent in their performances especially Joaquin Phoenix and Mark Ruffalo. I think of Ruffalo as a ""good"" guy. I didn't like seeing him as the ""bad"" guy in this movie. Tragedy happens and we deal with it in different ways, some taking the high road. Ruffalo took the wrong way around causing his and the victim's family suffering to linger."
4,An Accurate Portrayal of The Post Civil War times,"This historical fiction book is a very touching book to read. It examines the life of the homeless children in Russia after the Civil War and shows how life really was like back in those days of oppression, poverty and hunger. This book is about a young boy named Alex, whose family has been taken away by the Communists. He ends up living with a band of other homeless children. Through living with them, he experiences all sorts of things and realizes that even among these fierce children who have to survive, goodness can still shine through the smog of the goverment's control."
3,"The book was different, and interesting.","I liked the book, because it had some mistory,and excitement. Finding out that people were missing that were always around. Not knowing where they were going to stay, or get food.Having to care for people that are sick, and not having enough medication for every one. The book really makes you think of how things could be without someone there to care."
4,I think that is was a good book about survival.,I liked the book it was a good reminder of that you should be thank full for what you have. I also lets you know how it was for young children in Russua.One thing that I did not like about the book was that iit did not keep my intetest.The children had to have a vary strong will to be able to stay alive for such a long time by them selfs. Over all it was a good book to read in class.
4,Because it has alot of action,The book had alot of adventure.The book also had alot of action. The book was nice and I liked it. They shared all the food they had no matter how much they had. Then when they did they did't get that much.You could tell that they cared for each other very much.
3,It was a good book about survival and drugs.,"I found this book to be about survival and about rules for The Wild Chidren, a gang of roughed up little punks.They steal to earn money for food and herbs for when the kid get sick. They pick up sick kids and they take them to a childrens home. They end up getting in trouble for smuggling drugs, but they didn't. To find out who did it you have to read the book."
3,I do recommand you read this book,I do recommand you to read this book if you are a child wanting to know about life. This book explains how life in the 1920's was for people with no money. If you grow up poor you should read this book. If you know parents growing up than this is a good book to check out. If you like sad things than this is for you.
4,"I recommend or,do not recommend this book","I do recommend this book because. I like the characters in the book. The characters are real direct and sincere. Its abiut a kid that lost his family, and has to learn about it himself. I would recomend it.I gave it two thumbs up."
3,I recommend this book.,"I thought the book was ok. It would teach kids about what or what not to do. It tells you to not steal, but that is how the children had to survive. The wild children also was interesting because they survived in hard ways, but tried their hardest. It was kind of gross when Kostia ate human flesh."
3,I recomend this book.,I recomend reading this book. This is because I am interested in many topics during the Russian Revolution. Such as the of soliders and other military related topics. In the book I was interested in the book when Kostia ate the human flesh.I liked this book.
3,I recomend this book for everyone.,I recomend this book becaus it deals with some of issues of today. Even thoes that took place way back then. If I would to read it agin I would take a little more time on it. Because Ido not think I red it very good. I wish everyone could read this book.
3,I thought the book was interesting but It was boring,"I thought ""The Wild Children"" by Felice Holman was an interesting book but to me it seemed a little boring. It was interesting because some of the things in the book are still happening today. Like all the homeless people we have. It was boring because nothing hardly ever happend."
2,I did not like the book,I did not like this book because it was extremly dull.I did not understand the charitor of Alex. I could not follow though with it at all. The people in the book were not tought through very well.They sould have thought it out more.
1,Well.....,"I thought the book was terrible. I like to read books about the good things in the world. Not about how people die and young children die in the streets and some morning, any morning you could wake up without a family. I hated the book, and im not going to try to hide it."
2,Iwould not not recomend this book for others to read,This book is ok but I would not recomend it.I didn't find it interesting. It is for a lower reading level than I have. Other people that have read it that I know of didn't like it either.The plot is what was least interesting.
3,"It did not intreast me, but others might like it",This book was O.K. Itabout a boy who work up and his parents were gone. We still have alot of problems we have today.I don't like to read but if you do like to read you will like it. i thought it was neat when the Kostia was eatting the fleash.But the book was not my type.
3,I recommend this book.,I do recommend this book because some of the things in it were interresting. Kostia had to eat flesh in order to stay alive. Peter killed somebody. Alex's parents disappeared. This book takes place in the 1920's in Russia.
3,it was a good book,"this is a book about a boy alex.whose parents disappeared.the story is in the 1920's in russia.this is during the time of the russia revolution. The story is manily aabout alex trying to survive friends including his teacher katriara and others such as anya,Ivan boris and peter"
3,This book was ok.,This book was ok. It was about a boy who wakes up and his family is gone.So he has to go out and learn how to surive. Alot of problems in the book are alot like we have today. If your board one day it wouldn't be a bad idea to go read this book.
3,This book was a ok book.,"This book was a ok book.It had a nice ending,and it told nice details.I like the topic a little bit but I think that people today should help the homeless people out.The part I liked the most at the end,but the whole book was fine.It was fine because they all stay togather to work things out.There was not a part that I did not like."
4,I do recommed this book.,I do recommed this book becaus it show's how to day still is. Though cold and hunger and lost of love ones. This book tells it all. I think that poeple should read it is very good and that all should read. I really injoyed this book a hole lot.
3,I would recomend this book.,"I recomend this book because it told how peolple lived avter the Russin Revolution. I learn ed how kids would steal, beg, and deal drugs for food and money."
2,The Ghost Of Hollow Mystery,"Bucky and Christopher's things go missing. They go investagating. The auther P. Carver, makes this book seem like an exciting book, but it isn't. In the story The Ghost Of Hollow Mystery, people start to leave and their money is missing. Christopher and Bucky saw a shawdow and told their grandmother about the shawdow. Their grandmother told the kids about the stories about a ghost in the woods and that people go missing. Bucky than gose to the woods and sees two men go into a cabin, he is convienced that the two men are the ghost. Bucky, Christopher, Jane, and Malinda go investagat the mystery. The problem int he book is that the people's money is missing and they start to leave. This is a problem because their population is going down and money in missing. I don't recommand you to read this book."
2,needs reenforced straps,Nice box except the inside bands that hold the watch need stitches rather than glue. Bought as gift; first watch put in broke the holding strap. Item was easily returned and credited.
4,Very good book to help you reach a comfort zone ...,"I purchased this book to learn about Dreamweaver MX's development environment, and particularly about ASP.NET development work. Even though my programming language interest is VB.NET, not C#, I still found this book to be very beneficial in helping me to become familiar with Dreamweaver, and also, on how to set up ASP.NET projects. Yes, I must admit the error concerning BindData [should have been DataBind] was annoying, but overall, I like this book, and have no regrets spending the money to purchase it."
5,Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant!,"I would recommend this book to anyone!!!! It makes easy work of .NET, and crams a lot of really useful topics into the 310 pages.I bought a 1,000 page book (for twice the price) before I bought this one, and I learned and was inspired 10 000 times more by this little gem than by my other ""brick"". The book is also written in a very light hearted fashion, that doesn't put you to sleep!My only critisism is that it didn't explain properly how to ""deploy"" your supporting files into a .dll in your bin directory for the DataSet exercise that ends on page 151. It also didn't explain that you have to install the .NET SDK (which doesn't seem to come with the .NET disks) to run web services successfully, in the final chapters of the book. You have to download the SDK from Microsoft's website and install that first.Other than that though, it's a wonderful book. Well done to the authors. You've got my vote!"
2,"Great Songs, TERRIBLE Sound Quality!","I'll keep this review consise and to the point. This live album features some of Danzig's best songs. However, the sound quality it terrible. Danzig's voice often cannot be heard at all and the instruments also tend to fade in and out. For comparison, only the Misfit's ""Live Evil"" has worse sound!I cannot recommend this album. Sorry."
1,I should've known.,"I remember seeing Danzig in 1995 and even though I love Danzig's studio stuff I remember finding their live performance very weak. I have read that Glenn dislikes doing concerts and it is cleary audible in this CD. The vocals are weak and inaudible in many parts and the overall mix and recording make it sound as though it was done on a concertgoers contraband tape recorder. I wanted to believe that Danzig had gotten better in the last few years but it is obvious that the live stuff is still weak. And even though, as a previous review says, it is a ""truly"" live CD that doesn't mean it is fun to listen to or that it is worth the price. So in my opinion wait for the next studio album."
1,Poor Performance and Recording,"The old Misfits live recordings sound better than this. All of the performances are lame and the only reason it gets one star is because of John Christ's guitar playing..... and even that isn't worth the price of this CD. So far Glenn owes me about $40. $15 for that horrible fifth album (Techno?) and $25 for this one. Until I get a check, Jerry and Doyle are the keepers of the flame in my book."
4,"NOT THAT BAD, PEOPLE!!!!!!!!","Listen, I have never heard a live recording from Danzig that I honestly thought was fenominal, but this is not as bad as a lot of raters have tried to suggest. The sound is NOT BAD and his voice does not sound as terrible as most people like to describe! Try singing/SCREAMING through a whole show some time. Your voice will not hold up the whole time, I promise! With the harsh vocals he spits out, he does fine live. Hell, he does better live than Metallica ever has anyway, Goddammit!!!!!!!! Seriously, Get off him!"
2,could be much better,"The sound recording is rather poor, not just because of vocal drop outs but also the overall quality. Live albums should have that stereo depth sound that makes them cool; this one does not, as it sounds more like it was recorded on a cheap tape recorder."
2,"Can't wait for the ""Remastered Version""!","Granted, the setlist is glorious, but the sound quality of these cd's suck. Ok, Disc 1 ws recorded in '92 and 94', (it's very much listenable as a good bootleg), but that doesn't excuse it for sounding bad, it was only 9 years ago. On to disc 2. Simply put, sounds even worse. Sounds like it was recorded on a ""boombox""! Man, I dig Danzig alot, but if my garage band put this out, I would be embarrassed. Long live Danzig!! Peace out."
1,The Toilet,Is the place for this - at least it sounds like it was recorded in one. This has to be WITHOUT A DOUBT the worst sounding live record ever recorded. Evilive sounds like THX surround sound compared to this pice of dog crap. How could someone put this out for sale? The mixing engineer needs to be beaten repeatedly. Did I mention that this album is AWFUL? ESPECIALLY disc 2. AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL!
3,Bad Sound Quality,"This two concerts have very bad sound quality, they are the worst work i have ever seen, but i am a really Danzig fan and i like it a lot, but i was waiting some quality like the concerts from Iron Maiden or Gun&R. Cya..."
2,Disappointed! If I wanted a bootleg a would have got 1 !,"""Official release"" BULLFLOP! I have unofficial bootlegs that blow this away. What were they thinking?I have listened to Danzig's music scince day one, and dig all of it, but disc 2 of this cd was a terrible let down. I hope Glen understands this and releases something better. Marc G. (aka Sid )"
2,"Good idea, bad execution","It is cool to have a live disc that spans the entire Danzig era. It is too bad that it sounds like it was mixed with equipment from the Big Band era. This is a very poorly mixed disc; the sound quality is often terrible. Sometimes they even lose Danzig singing. If you like Danzig, wait until the next studio. If you love him, I'll sell you my copy."
4,"Dark, dirty and beautiful","I just wish to say that I agree with the last two reviews of this release - it's splendid. Alright, perhaps the recording on disk 2 is questionable in places, however, the first disk is astounding, displaying many of Danzig's finest tracks in a rough- edged, dirty, live format which truly befits the songs. Certainly the vocals fade in and out from time to time but surely you must appreciate that Danzig is on-stage strutting his splendid, unholy self and may miss the mic or indeed the odd note; but when the overall product is as raw and energetic as this who are you to complain - the guy rocks and this is not a studio album and therefore does not claim to be polished. All the better for it."
1,Almost as bad as St. Anger.,Definitely the worst live album I've ever heard. The production value is horrible. You can also hear the people in the audience better than you can hear Danzig. Don't waste your money on this crap.
1,HORRIBLE,Put your Boom Box next to speakers and record - this is the sound quality of these recordings. Disk 1 is better than Disk 2 - but is still HORRIBLE.I AM A DANZIG FAN - BUT EXPECT A BETTER PRODUCT FOR MY MONEY.Garage bands make better sounding disk's.If Glen release's crap I say its crap - if its EXCELLANT I'll say its EXCELLANT. I have ear's.
2,Sorry this was released.,"Let me start off by saying I'm a huge Danzig fan. I have loved every project he has been a part of. When I heard there was a live album in the works that spanned the last 7 years, I was excited to say the least. After hunting this album down (No one knew when it was being released due to bad planning) I rushed to the nearest cd player. Well...let me say, from start to finish, this 2 disk set sounds like a bad bootleg. Not only can you not hear Danzig's vocals, but the insturments sound out of key and muffeled. I have seen Danzig in concert 3 times and never has he sounded this horrible. The reason I give this album 2 stars instead of 1 is because of the interseting set list. However, what's the use of having great live songs if you cannot understand them. Try again Mr. Danzig."
1,buy it used..if you have to buy it at all,"1st disk not bad...but the 2nd just sucked a**. Sound quality is horrible and sometimes you can't tell what is the song being ""played"".Luckily I didn't buy brand new and found it on the bottom shelf of a used cd store....If you paid more than $5.00 it's not worth it...."
2,"I never thought I'd say this, but I expected better...","Glenn Danzig has always done what he has pleased, but I think he should have reconsidered his live album. Disc 1 is good, its the old lineup and the sound quality is great, but Disc 2's sound quality is so bad its not even funny. Glenn sounds like he's singing in a paper bag, and the distortion makes it sound worse. If you want a Danzig live album, check out his bootleg live albums, they might cost a bit more, but they're sound quality is better."
4,DANZIG,"I really like both discs. Im glad the new line up played on the second disc. I could do without the pentagram shirt though.The satans child material sounds better live, more of astripped down sound. blends in with the old stuff kinda."
5,Pure Raw Danzig,"This is a great live album. The sound is a little choppy on some songs but if any of you have ever seen Danzig ""live"", that is how they sound. Intense, loud and out of control. Live Danzig is a sight to see and this record really captures it."
2,Portable?,These seemed like good headphones at first - but problems with portablity were huge! The sound was good but 3 months into ownership one earpeice died so the phones are useless!! NOT worth spending time and money on these phones.
3,"Nice looks, but average sound","I have used other Koss headhones (KTX-Pro, KSC-50, TD65) before and they all have that nice, crisp, warm-sounding ""Koss""-trademark sound. The UR29, however, although speced better than the TD65, did not have this trademark sound. Even though it has a higher frequency response of up to 20khz, it sounded very muffled: the mids sounded ""watery"" and the highs were totally lacking. The bass was satisfactory. The isolation of the earcups is quite good, but unfortunately the sound just didn't cut it.In terms of design, the UR29 is quite nice, but flimsy in build. The folding mechanism is not very intuitive and many users will likely break the linkages after extended use.Overall, nice looks, but average to sub-average sound."
5,"Great Stereophones, very comfortable, in-line volume control","I had originally bought a pair of Sony MDR 150's, but found they were quite uncomfortable. However, these Koss UR29 are VERY comfortable. The earcups are well padded and fit over your whole ear. The headband is also thickly padded. Another advantage is that the cord enters the left earcup only -- the right wire goes through headband. This results is much reduced chance of tangled wires. There is a built-in volume adjuster, which lies about 12'' from the left ear cup. Handy feature if you're on a computer. One thing that I did not see with this headphone was an adapter to fit into the thicker headphone jacks, like those commonly found on receivers.As for sound, I'm quite pleased. The lows, mids, and highs come out crisp and cleanly, and the bass can be really felt when its demanded.The only downside in my opinion is its somewhat bulky nature, but I can understand why -- the comfort level is fantastic.Highly recommended. .... at CircuitCity."
3,cheap parts,"The koss ur/23 headphones are pretty nice looking and also sound great, however, the inner plastic piece by the ear is relatively chea9p and breaks easily. after looking online, you can't just order that little part and put your head phones back together, you'll just have to buy a totally new set of headphones or walk around with one of your ear pieces broken and hanging off to the side. i've already been through two pairs of the koss ur/29 headphones, and no matter how much i will love to get some more of the same ones, i highly doubt it because the end result will be the same, a broken cheap plastic piece which = new headphones or broken headphones..."
2,ok,these headphones are ok. slightly too tight (i do have a big head). and the sound quality is average. i do not reccomend them.
2,Carpe Diem,When I first bought these headphones I was quite pleased with them. They delivered richness in sound while effectively neutralizing outside noise. But after about a month the sound in the left earpiece began to fade in and out leaving one to fiddle with the cord until some semblence of sound quality had returned. Now unless one holds the cord at an odd angle around the volume control there is no audible sound from the earpiece. I don't know whether it's just my pair or not because a very large electronics chain wouldn't give me another pair(I'm looking at you Circuit City). So there are two things to be learned here.1) When these Koss headphones work they're a pleasure to own but they are subject to a short lifespan.and2)The people at Circuit City are wankers.
3,"Nice sound, but why so tight?","Nice all-around sound for music/games/movies, sturdy construction, very clear bass and separation. However, they become EXTREMELY unconfortable in your head after a couple of hours, very tight headband even in the largest adjustment. Earcups are also a bit too small and (again) too tight, make yours ears sweat in no time. If improved in the ergonomics side, would be a truly great product."
3,Perfect sound quality but not durable,"I've had the Koss headphones for about a year and thats how long they lasted. Koss has a good pair of headphones on their hands but it's not durable for the application I use it for. I'm a DJ and during one of my gigs the headphone just broke, I guess it cannot take the stress of DJ use. It broke at the point where the ear cup connects to the headband, Koss used plastic to reinforce that area and it cracked and broked. If Koss would have made that connection out of metal I think it would be perfect. I had to complete my gig with broken headphones which was very uncomfortable. I later customized it into a one earcup headphone since i only needed to listen to my cue points, a month later the other ear cup broke,sound wise it still works. What you get with the expensive headphones is durability."
2,A couple of hits...,This demonstrates just how redundant some compilation album titles are. All Carole's major hits are absent and there are lots of relatively insignificant album tracks. Don't waste your money - get the much better compilations 'Songs of long ago' or better still 'Natural woman'.
3,some of her hits but not super,"If you don't own any of her records, I would not recommend this one.Some of her hits are here,but What about ""Brother, Brother"" and ""So far away""? It's better for you to buy ""Her Greatest Hits"" or the two cd compilation ""A Natural Woman"" which includes her masterpiece ""Tapestry"". Anyway, ""Super Hits"" is not a bad album to start."
3,Good budget line compilation,"Sony's budget line series ""Super Hits"" throws up a fine sampler of Carole's early to mid 70's catalogue, featuring songs from various albums:1. Smackwater Jack - Tapestry (1971).2. I Feel The Earth Move - The Carnegie Hall Concert: June 18, 1971 (1996).3. Sweet Seasons - Music (1971)4. Carry Your Load - Music (1971).5. Been to Canaan - Rhymes and Reasons (1972).6. Nightingale - Wrap Around Joy (1974).7. Jazzman - Wrap Around Joy (1974).8. Corazon - Fantasy (1973).9. That's How Things Go Down - Fantasy (1973).10. Only Love Is Real - Thoroughbred (1975).All of these appeared on 45rpm singles, except Carry Your Load & I Feel The Earth Move (the Tapestry version was the b-side to It's Too Late).While this compilation is clearly deficient in terms of the missing gems from her vast back catalogue, it is still a good place to start for those only briefly familiar with her wonderful music.3 1/2 stars."
4,Very good model of both history-making spacecraft.,"Reasonably accurate. Quite large. The best part is that everything separates into the four modules-Lunar Descent and Ascent, Command, and Service-and shows better than anything else out there how the two attached for the flight to the Moon. If you're looking for a finely, exquisitely detailed model, don't look here, though."
4,Very nice short novel,"I picked up the book one lazy Sunday evening, and was pleasantly surprised to find myself totally engrossed in the story and turning the pages avidly. The author turns out fine alliterative phrases and succeeded in creating a vivid tropical world of colors, sounds and smells which I could relate to being from a tropical country myself. There is a strong moral undertone to the story of Ayla's life which however does not overwhelm the central theme -- that one can overcome any adversity. From the early death of her mother, through Ayla's struggles to complete her education, find a lasting love; and later raise a family as a single parent -- one learns that with inner strenght founded on a deep spiritual belief one can overcome these challenges and achieve any goals. Still, this novel is recommended reading for a relaxing evening."
5,Great CD,"I bought this CD for two reasons: Because John Taglieri is very talented and his music rock....and because I want to support a talented musician who has in many ways is mentauring me and has given me tons of valuable advice regarding the music business, so I consider him my friend.Thanks John! You rule!"
4,Blazin Album,the Band is top Notch&Grant Green is Smoking&Grooving.the Arrangements&Instrumentation are smoking.props to Blue Note Records for letting this Jam out of the Vault.Really Good Disc.
1,completely obsolete,"This is a 2004 test prep book. It's not going to help anyone taking 2009 or 2010 tests. In fact, I have no idea why Amazon is still selling it. Maybe if it had a giant OBSOLETE label, but still, someone not reading carefully could easily get this and waste their money."
5,What a find!,"This is a really clever book. The ideas are so fresh and modern. The projects are easy to understand and accompianied by great photography. I think the ideas could be easily adapted to fit into a wide variety of budgets and levels of sophistication. It's a must for anyone who loves funky designs and enjoys a ""do it yourself"" approach to decorating. It's also just a fun book to look at, very colorful and full of photos."
3,Fun music,"This is the first Sugar Ray CD I've purchased and I enjoyed it. There are a couple of songs that seem like they were ""filler"" material. But overall I definitely liked it. 'When it's over' is my favorite cut."
3,"Good buy for Pop, Ska, and Rock fans.","Great beat, decent lyices, and good for listing to when you are feeling blue. Suger Ray combined Ska, Pop, and Rock pretty good, but for some reson Mark Magraph's very soft voice gets on my nerves after awhile."
2,Anyone ever heard their first album?,"I'm guilty of always getting the typical Sugar Ray ""radio"" song stuck in my head and I wind up buying the CD. A few weeks later I always regret it because these guys are the definition of a sell-out band. Their first CD ""Lemonade & Brownies"" was much heavier than any of the subsequent releases. They strike me as a band that is always concerned with writing that radio hit. Mark McGrath, self-admittingly, can't sing and the rest of the band is competent, but nothing spectacular muscially.I'm not against mainstream rock at all, I just think this band is too into it for the hits. It's too bad, because I don't think they are such bad songwriters. There lyrics suck, but that's another review."
5,Best Sugar Ray Album yet!!!!!,"After listning to 14:59 who would ever think Sugar Ray would make another album as good? I gave up with them until i heard ""When it's Over"" in a Niketown store in San Francisco. I imedetly left and bought it. GREAT CD!"
4,Buy this!!!!!!!,"You sugar ray, smash mouth,and Blink fans need 2 go get this one!!! The only setback is that it is only 39 min and 47 sec. so its ^ 2 u"
2,A letdown after their previous efforts ...,"I've enjoyed both ""sides"" of Sugar Ray, the breezy Fly / Every Morning side and harder-edged RPM side. I though Floored was great, and 14:59 softer overall but still great. However, this self-titled album is just not that interesting. Only the hit When It's Over caught my attention, and the rest of the songs just feel like mushy top-40 radio crap. (Of course Fly was top-40, but I never considered it crap.) There is little of the edge, humor, or fun of previous Sugar Ray CDs on this release.If you have the two popular albums already, I would suggest that Lemonade and Brownies is a much more interesting and fun (and LOUDER and raunchier) CD than this one."
5,Awesome CD!!,The new Sugar Ray CD is great! It is definately the CD of the summer. Its up beat and sounds great. Their new producer has done a lot of good for them. If you are a Sugar Ray fan you will love their new CD. I haven't stoped listening to the CD since I've bought it! I can't wait to see them this summer in concert!
4,Rocking!,This is an awesome Cd.If you like rock you would love this Cd.From slow to fast in beat.The beat is great.Great singing.Really smooth.My favorite song would have to be When It is Over track 2 and track 6 these sounded best.Great for all Sugar Ray fans and alternitve fans.Reminds me me of Blink 182 a little except not the bad lyrics!
4,Sugar Ray's most serious album!,Mark expresses his thoughts really idealistically and is quite clever to bring up this album to the point where enough is enough! C'mon!! someone else should write a review real soon!!
4,"Already my ""Theme Music"" for Summer 2001","Let me just say first off that the one mark of a truly great disc is if you like every song on the album. The song currently played on the radio, ""When It's Over,"" is truly indicative of the nature of the disc: if you like that song, you will love the entire album.In all seriousness, I think this album is showing a softer side of the band than the previous two. The lyrics are a bit commonplace in that they are neither truly original nor truly brilliant. However, the catchy reggae-influenced tunes more than make up for this.It's perfect music for putting the the CD player in your car and jamming to on a beautiful sunny and hot summer day! I'm going to play it over and over until the disc probably wears out! Let's just hope that the Seattle weather cooperates with me though!"
4,"Man, this album is the bomb","This album is the bomb. It is one solid disc. Lots of great catch songs. This is my first sugar ray album, and I am really impressed by their music. This is one of those cds that it great for playing at a party or in your car because it is very positive and it rocks. If your a drummer, it has some great songs to drum to. Lots of catchy guitar rhythms in the tracks and Mark McGrath does a great job as the lead singer.Another plus is that this album has hardly any objectionalbe content, so It's don't worry about that. Overall, a great disc and a great buy."
2,Okay,"This album suffers from following one the best--in my opinon--albums to come along in along in a long, long time. I thought 14:59 was amazingly good, bordering on great. This album is okay. I like a lot on it. But not much of it grabs me, and makes me just crazy in love with the songs, like the last one. I've only listened to it once, so maybe it will grow on me. But I loved the last album instantly. Mark McGrath and Stan Frazier went to my high school (I missed them by a year) so I have a sentimental reason for wanting them to be GREAT. And I'm sure they will be again. This album still ranks better than most other stuff out there. But it's more good background party music, than one you sit down with headphones, and listen to with no distractions like 14:59... It's NOT a reversion to their old sound (which I'd read this might be, and was something I dreaded). The songs here have the basic feel of the sounds of 14:59's EVERY MORNING and FALLS APART...but not nearly as good as those. Not nearly."
3,Just average,"Awesome price, average band, for some reason I thought they sounded better back in the day, it just brought back weird memory's of a decade ago"
1,What happened?,"This is the best example of selling out I have ever seen. With their first two albums, they were hard rock and punk, and then they had Fly become a hit, and now I see them in matching white dress shirts with an acoustic guitar. Mark McGrath went from a great singer to a money-grubbing MTV .... They completely ... now."
3,BORRRING,"Sugar Ray's fan base was a moderate size up to the 14:59 album. But I don't know if anyone has their self-titled album (except me). To be honest, this album was a big step down from their usual fare. Does anyone even remember any song off this album besides ""When It's Over""? Before I saw the video for ""Answer The Phone"", I forgot that was even on the album - and that's the first song.It's not that the rest of the songs on here are bad; they're just okay. The album is only forty minutes long, and I listened to it several times without remembering any of it (except for ""When It's Over""). Truthfully, the only album Sugar Ray really made that had the most good songs on it was 14:59, so just stick with that."
2,They Abandoned Rock,"Sugar Ray was good at one time. RPM was an enjoyable little diddy, but as soon as they found out they'd make more money with that poppy acoustic rock, they got on their knees to make the audiences happy. Although the CD is okay, it's too poppy for me. The best treat is by far the song ""Stay On"" with Nick Hexum, frontman of the band 311. Many people fail to realize Hexum's vocals on this though, therefore it will be skipped. Overall, this should appeal to all the bubblegum pop fans, as well as the blink 182 teenyboppers out there.Music fans can pass on this one though, you've heard it before."
3,Pretty Phat!!,"My boyz in Sugar Ray know how to please everybody - from fans of Da Stones to fans of lightweight hip-hop, and even fans of cool pop music. The sheer rush you feel from ""Answer the Phone"" will make you want to grab your girlfriend and simply dance (maybe more than dance!)!! But seriously, the song really does contain layered vocals at the chorus that sound like da bomb. If all the songs were like the leadoff track, dis would easily be a 5-star album rating! Oh well, Sugar Ray still do a pretty good job here. From phat trip-hop beats to raunchy guitar segments, dis is da best summer album of all time - Mark McGrath even suggested as much, and that guy is da total bomb!!!Well, I gots to git. Check this one out if you want some mad beats and a fresh style. As usual, McGrath and da boys from Sugar Ray are up to no good!!!Peace out, and I'll see ya'............."
2,Cookie cutter LA band....so what!,"Sugar Ray is meaningless fun and nothing more. No need to buy this CD, just listen to the radio and you will get your fill."
2,There have been better,If you dont have any of Sugar Rays C.D's Buy 14:95 it is much better thatn this one.
5,Great CD,"Sugar Ray's third CD ""Sugar Ray"" is an awesome CD! Even though there are only 11 songs, it's definately worth it. This CD is more passionate than Sugar Ray's previous CDs. Lyrics are focused on past relastinships. Mark MacGrath has an awesome voice throughout the whole CD. The guitars are also exellent in the CD. Some of my favorite songs on the CD are Answer the Phone - catchy lyrics and melody, When It's Over - catchy melody, Ours - DJ Homicide sounds awesome on the turn tables, Sorry Now - Guitars sound sweet, Words to Me - Sugar Ray at their best, and Disaterpiece - great lyrics. BUY THIS CD!!!"
5,AMAZING,"I love this CD! I ran out and bought it the DAY it came out (today, lol) and have been listening to it nonstop. It is definitely more pop than Sugar Ray's past albums but it works for them! They have some great stuff on here, my favs are ""Stay On,"" which has a funky, reggae beat that forces you into a good mood, and ""Waiting,"" which is very pop but also a great song. I cried when I listened to it the first time.. the lyrics are just really touching. There are a couple slow songs (Waiting is one of them) but the rest are up-tempo, bouncy, SoCal songs.. and that's what Sugar Ray does best! An awesome CD, I totally recommend it!"
5,what more could you want from a fitness book?,"I picked this up in a book store for only $5 and was impressed with my bargin. This book has it all, from diet to weight loss to meditation - in relation to martial arts. It is full of photos so for those like me who love looking at pictures, this is a must!What this book is, is a series of martial arts workouts, each designed for a specific task. For instance ""the healing hand"" is a chapter on relieving tension, etc, and is presented with a number of stretches. On the other hand, the Hi Chi workout is designed to get the heart pumping and the calories burning!!QUite simply, I can not think of what more I would expect for a book on fitness. It covers all the bases, it has pictures to follow, and ready made workouts. Which is why I give it 5 stars!"
5,A clever and musical treat for children of all ages,"My 5 year old loves the book rainbow fish and the TV series based upon it and now the CD. Best of all, parents will enjoy the sophistication and cleverness of the songs which are in various styles of pop from Beach Boys to Spice Girls...from Johnny Cash-ish type ballad to Dixieland horns. The songs are positive in message, yet humorous and a bit sly, since they all have a fish or underwater slant, chock full of puns that adults will enjoy. As a parent, I appreciate that it holds up under repeated listenings and there seems to be a new undiscovered gem (or to keep with the nautical theme --""buried treasure"" ) upon each subsequent listening. A true classic of children's music genre."
5,Fantastico Italia,Very adequate Italian words.Very helpful when needed.Great defenitions and pronuniations of the words.Would recommend for anyone who wants to speak Italian.
2,"An ""Idiot"" who's disappointed","I purchased this book based on several other reviews on Amazon. What a disappointment. If I decided to live in Italy, this book might come in handy, however, I wanted a simple ""Idiot's"" book for vacation travel to Italy. I just ordered and received the Rick Steves' Italian phrase book and dictionary. Rick Steves' book is so much better for travelers. Next time I shall graduate from the ""Idiot's"" level (I hope I am much wiser now) to a more approachable and better written phrase book like Rick Steves'.ciao"
1,Absolute Rubbish,"This CD is absolute rubbish. It is nothing more than the originals with poorly overdubbed rants. I was so disappointed with this CD I wrote Gnarls Barkley on Myspace and told them the CD was a rip off and that I was highly disgusted with ""most likely their record companies veiled attempt to squeeze a few more dollars out of their listeners""."
1,Awful,"It is quite literally just the same sound effects played over the top of a bunch of Gnarls Barkley and Gorillas songs over and over and over again - its potentially the worst thing I have ever paid money for.This is not a *remix*, remix involves actually some remixing and not just playing sound effects on top the song."
4,A Quality Tea,"I've had numerous red teas in the past couple years, and thought this one was quite good, though I prefer the additional flavorings in this brand's other offering: ""Rooibos and Honeybush"" tea."
5,"Awesome poster for ""Wayne's World"" fans!","What a great poster - the black and white makes it seem like a classic! Very fun poster - I recommend it for all ""Wayne's World"" fans."
5,Excellent!,"This poster is brilliant quality - unfortunately it arrived badly damaged - not the senders fault. The carrier had damaged packaging really badly. I notified Hersch posters after Xmas as this was for my twelve year old son, who loves it.Hersch sent a replacement right away - what can I say - EXCELLENT!"
4,Lame ending!,"My 8 and 5 year old grandsons liked the suspense of this story but after the kids see Bigfoot, there's a very flat and abrupt disregard of their experience."
1,Parker's Spenser series should've ended before Chance,"I used to wait eagerly for the next installment of Robert B. Parker's Spenser series. I'm done waiting. The last three books, ending with Chance, have bored me to death. Chance is the piece-de-resistance. I kept waiting for the mystery to show itself. Turns out, there wasn't one. Spenser spent the whole book following someone around Las Vegas. Parker's early Spenser books are gems, but don't waste your time with Chance."
5,Exceptionally Well Done,"The thing about Spencer novels is the presentation of the main characters; Susan, Hawk, and especially Spencer are cool. Because the books are written from a first person perspective, there is a special opportunity for audio books. Burt Reynolds takes advantage of that opportunity. His character portrayals are excellent.Reynolds delivery is outstanding. He doesn't try too hard. His timing is great. Sometimes it's almost like he is talking specifically to me, not to a room of people - like he is responding to my feedback or something! He portrays the characters as I imagined them before I ever listened to a Spencer audiobook. (I didn't watch the TV series more than a couple times.)Even without Reynolds, ""Chance"" is an interesting story, with a good balance between action & dialog, plot & character development. With Reynolds, it is six stars!"
4,Great Spenser,"No fat, terse good humor, best good bad guys out there. While the story is great (Spenser and Hawk go to Vegas looking for somebody and things become convoluted, of course), what's wonderful about Parker's books are the writing itself, his dialogue and the characters. I didn't like the first Spenser novel I read (a more recent one) and waited a long time to try another but am glad I did. Parker's terrific."
3,A hostile takeover may be percolating,"Spenser is asked to find Julius Ventura's son-in law, Anthony Meeker. Ventura gives Spenser a hard look. He is connected.Anthony gambles a lot and loses. He is probably afraid of his wife Shirley's father. He handles money for Ventura, Shirley believes. Anthony used to speak to a waitress about his system for winning at gambling.Susan tells Spenser it is unwise to generalize about the sources of compulsive behavior. Anthony may have been carrying money betwee Ventura and Gino Fish. He is probably in Las Vegas. Spenser decides to go there with Susan and Hawk.Anthony is found at the Mirage. Shirley Ventura dies in Las Vegas. Spenser makes the identification for the police since she is found holding his card. It seems that Anthony is actually in Las Vegas with a rival tough guy's wife.Scams and cross-scams cause death and mayhem. Even the Russians are involved in the action."
3,Spenser chances Vegas,"I have been a fan of Spenser since the early 1980s. I occasionally indulge myself with his world. ""Chance"", however, is not one of Parker's better works.Can I suggest to American readers that they try to get hold of books by Peter Corris and his character Cliff Hardy who is a Sydney based Private Investigator and a little less slick than Spenser. The style of writing is similar but Cliff seems to dwell more in the real world than Spenser.Regardless, I will continue to delve back into Spenser although ""Chance"" is not one of Parker's best."
1,Works well for a few minutes.,"This was the second Zebco rod that I had bought for our grandson. Since he is only 5 and I thought that, perhaps, he had been too rough when taking up the slack. This time, he was working on casting in the back yard and the practice lasted a very short time, less than an hour, when the line snarled. These rods are impossible to take apart in order to rewind the spool. I had read reviews online at Amazon and they were about 50-50 but each customer was very satisfied or vewrysorry that they'd made the purchase. I don't think a 50% approval rating is a very good recommendation."
5,"very cute, durable little fising pole",a great first fishin pole for the sponge bob user. havent fished yet but he has a ball playing fishing in the house
1,Sponge Bob sinks!,This should be a perfect kid's rod - my grandson is 5 and we took him fishing for the first time last week - the rod was a perfect size for him and he managed the casting and reeling in just perfectly - - however - after about 8 casts - he was no longer able to reel in the line -it just sat there no matter how he cranked in the reel - all of the adults tried to fix the rod - - to no avail - - there were no backlashes on the line - nothing - it just broke - - fortunately we were able to get him a regular adult rod that he could manage and he caught his first fish - a rainbow trout!
2,THIS IS FUSEBOX 3 !!!,Fusebox is on version 4 as of 8/2004. This book is for Fusebox 3 ONLY!Get a Fusebox 4 book if you are starting from scratch with FB4 as 3 and 4 are VERY different.I will let others discuss the quality of this book - it is mostly a moot point for someone wanting the full benefits of FB.
2,Not much help,If you are new to fusebox you will probably read this book cover to cover and step away knowing nothing of practical value. This book could be useful as a high level reference for an experienced fuseboxer but not much else.
2,"Agree with the ""too-Preachy"" conclusion","I agree with some of the other comments I've read on here and from co-workers -- the book covers the basics well but is too ""preachy"" when it comes to the ""FLiP"" development cycle. We have our own development process in-house and I really just wanted a solid reference book for FuseBox 3 in which I could quickly look up what I wanted."
5,"Good Coverage of FuseBox 3.0, FuseDoc 2.0 and FLiP","This book covers almost all aspects of FuseBox 3.0, FuseDoc 2.0 and FLiP. It covers most areas as thoroughly as possible in a single volume book. Some areas are glossed over, but, at least, they are mentioned. Several areas could have been dealt with in a little more depth, such as MVC, Prototyping, nested layouts and reusability using the CFModule tag. This book is much better, overall, than ""Discovering Fusebox 3 with ColdFusion"" by Hal Helms and Joh Quarto-vo Tivadar. That book fills in a few of the gaps left by Peters and Papovich's, but dealt too deeply into the ""Techspedition Intranet Contact Manager"" application. Peter's book does a good job of explaing the core files and making strong recommendations while still leaving room for accomodating situations out of norm. It was well written and well organized. The appendices are helpful as summarization material."
3,an interesting book,"I enjoyed reading the book. There were a few good tips that I think I will be able to use. Some parts of the book seemed like they were ""lecturing"" me, though. It made me a little uncomfortable.I prefer to see a smaller book that deals only with coding and leaves out what the authors called ""FLIP"". The coding is something that really can be useful if everyone is doing the same thing whereas the FLIP stuff was just good ideas and suggestions. We have our own processes for this in-house.Since there are only a few Fusebox books, I would recommend this one to have for reference and would also want to have the other new one."
4,"Clubbin, Bumpin, mashing @ 90mph Track!!","I am a personally ordained minister of SIRIUS Satellite Radio (www.sirius.com). SIRIUS is exactly like a local radio station minus commercials and minus corny morning shows. I was extremely frustrated for the Stanton Remix is played on SIRIUS often but could only find the album version. The STANTON REMIX is very hard to find; IMPORT only. The original double album is okay; not worth the $25-$35 however!!All i have to say is the song ""Dude Descending a Staircase"" is all about the social scene. ""... we party and bullsh*t.. and parrrty and bullsh*t.... and bulllllllsh********t!"""
5,Character Songs,"I really enjoy the tracks on this album. That's the basics of my 'review'.One thing people should know is that this set is for 'Character Songs'. You're not going to find these songs in the anime, but the Japanese voice actors do the songs and it's very fun.I would definitely recommend it for someone who is a diehard fan of the series, or if you tend to like characters songs. If you're looking for only the music you've heard in the anime, this probably isn't for you."
3,not wat it seems,i bought this cd while i was in japan for 36 US dollars approx. its a 2 disc set with 15 songs 1st disc and 7 second disc. the 2nd disc has some different versions of songs on the 1st excluding 2. so far i've haven't heard any songs that were in the ending or begining theme of fullmetal alchemist the series. In my mind don't get this if ur looking for the songs played in the anime series for the beginning and ending themes.
1,definitely not nonstick,"This pan is supposed to be non-stick. It took me 10 minutes just to dig out the rolls with a knife. Clean up was even worse, what a mess. I did'n get a booklet with it to tell me how to clean the pan or if I had so season it first."
1,HAZADOUS WARNING ON LABEL,Items were shipped as expected. Exactly what it shows on line. It looked great and felt great but attached to the bean bag was a tag that says: THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS A CHEMICAL KNOWN TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO CAUSE CANCER OR BIRTH DEFECTS OR OTHER REPRODCTIVE HARM. I have not reseached exactly what it means but I thought it best not to find out how dangerous it really is!
5,Awesome gift idea--my son loves this!,"I bought this for my 10 year old son. He loves it! He uses it for family movie nights. I want to try some of the other sports bean bag chairs for my other children. The quality is great--if it can last in a house of 4 rowdy boys, then it's well made!"
4,Wonderful,"I was looking for durable, bright alphabet magnets and these surpassed my expectations. Even the container they come in is great!"
4,Fun and safe - durability is so-so,"These magnets are great. They appear to be safe because the entire backing is made of a magnetic material. The magnet isn't too strong, but strong enough to stick to sheet metal.ConstructionThe construction of the product appears to be laminated wood or laminated wood pulp - looks like plywood, but much lighter.The painted layer is a laminated layer on top. I would not go as far to say that it is a sticker, but it's not simply painted wood.DurabilityLike other reviewers, I've noticed that the top painted layer will begin to wear or delaminate if your child puts it in their mouth. Other than that, the pieces are solid and stiff.I have the letters and the numbers set and I do recommend this product for its value and safety. I can imagine that there are higher quality products out there, but when you think about the longevity of children's' toys in general, this set is on par."
4,A great tool to play and teach Toddlers,The letters are a nice size for their small hands. I also like the case they come in for storage.
4,Love it!,I ordered the Melissa & Doug Magnetic Wooden Alphabet Letters & my son & I LOVE them! :) He's 15 months old & the first day we got them he went from the couch where they were. To the front door constantly one by one putting them on it! Cutest thing I've ever seen. I highly recommended these for the Earth minded mommy. I hate plastic baby toys so these suit our family great!
4,"Great Magnets, Wish there Were Multiples of Letters","These magnets are much better than the plastic ones. The entire letter is a flat magnet so they stick where and how you place them. They're much less frustrating for my 3-year-old than the plastic letters that were always sliding around or losing their magnets.There's only one of each letter in uppercase and one in lowercase. I would love a set of these with a selection of letters based on usage frequency. Luckily, my kid is too young to care about spelling out too many words or sentences right now, so it's not really an issue yet.I recommend these to anybody looking for magnet letters that are better-looking and easier to use than the standard plastic letters."
4,"Not for younger toddlers, but mostly what I was looking for!","As the big yellow caution box clearly states, it's not for kids who are still putting things in their mouths and chewing (or under 3). These are not made for that kind of durability.My son is 2, but since he is past that phase, he loves these magnets. He's already recognizing some letters, and really enjoys playing with these around the fridge. We spell out short words, sing the alphabet song, and play word and letter games with them.They are quite thin, which is a problem since they slide under the fridge so easily and get lost in other places, but so far, that's the only issue we've had."
3,So so magnets,"These magnets would be best used on a magnetic board or easel. We used them on our refrigerator, and just about every one of them is now under our refrigerator. They are so skinny that they slide right under. I like the Leap frog refrigerator magnets, b/c they are thicker and don't slide under. The lower case letters in this set are very small - I wouldn't recommend using them if your child is still Mouthing objects alot."
2,"Wait to purchase for toddler, not baby","This product is not durable enough to be put in a baby's mouth (our son is 10.5 months old), but we put it away for him when he is older. The color started coming off of the numbers/letters. We do like how the entire back of the numbers/letters is a thin magnet so that no small magnet pieces may be swallowed. Not sure if they are completely non-toxic but should be fine when our son is ready use the toy to create words, etc."
1,Not worth the money,The alphabets are ok looking. I thought they would be of better quality. Not happy and wouldn't have bought it if i saw it in store.
5,Great gift,"Gave this gift to my 2 year old grandson for Christmas. He loves it - it's one of the few toys he actually goes back to on a constant basis. In the less than a month since the holiday, he is able to recognize and identify 97% of the alphabet. Very durable. The magnet holds better than the plastic versions. I'm very pleased with this. I may purchase another set so he can begin spelling multiple words without reusing letters."
2,Disappointing durability,"I got these magnets for my nephew. They were very well received, however after less than 30 minutes, they were showing wear on the colored sides. Granted, they were briefly sucked on, but I am totally disappointed in this product. Kids put things in their mouths, and creating wood magnets that seem to have a sticker front that is susceptible to this kind of wear is ridiculous. When I ordered wood magnets, I expected them to be painted wood with magnetic backs. I was not expecting a sticker front that doesn't last well and doesn't wear well getting wet. If you want good looking magnets and you can keep them dry, then these would work. If you have any children that want to taste objects, don't get these."
4,Great product,These were purchased to help us teach a 3 1/2 year old her letters and their sounds. They are very durable and hold better than the plastic letters that we have all used on our refrigerators. We use these on magnetic wall paint in her bedroom-it is a fun and relaxing place to learn.I would recommend these to any preschooler.
4,ABC's,"I wanted to introduce lower case letters to my three year old, so I bought this set. The entire backing of the letters are magnetic so we never have a problem with the letters not sticking or slipping. The only negative I have is some of the lower case letters are very chunky and sometimes don't look like the letter they are suppose to be. This would be good for a child who already knows a lot of their lower case letters."
2,Beware: Magnets are paper over wood,"These magnets are very cute - bright colors and I love that the materials are non-toxic. However, I was expecting magnets made of wood. The core is wood, but the face is paper, which comes off. Disappointing."
2,NOT durable! So disappointed!!!,"We just got these for our 12 month old daughter. I know that it says not for under age 3 because of choking hazard, but after reading other reviews, I was convinced that these weren't likely a choking hazard. And they're not. But they're not durable for a child who puts things in their mouth. The magnets are the entire size of the letter, so ingesting or choking on a small magnet won't happen and the letters are quite large. We put them on the refrigerator about an hour ago and my little one just crawled up with the letter ""I"" in her mouth. When I took it away, I noticed that all the paper/colored part of the letter has completely melted off or bubbled up. These letters are not going to survive the mouthing stage! I just went and took them all off the refrigerator! She can have them back when she's a little older. The same thing will probably happen if these fall into a puddle of water on the kitchen floor or under the refrigerator door though so be careful."
4,Good product for money.,Veronika chews on it from time to time but they hold up for the most part and stick to fridge well. The magnet covers the whole back piece of the letter instead of a simple little square piece like the plastic ones.These are wooden but fairly durable.
5,magnetic letters,I purchased this item for use by my 1 1/2 yr old granddaughter. She likes it and is learning letters by playing with it on my refrigerator. I have found that she has to share it with her 22 yr old uncle.....:) I am very happy with my purchase.
4,Great ABCs,Good toy for my 2 year old. She loves playing with them and the construction of the individual letters is good; so no issue with quality.One complaint (and it is a minor one) is that the wooden box is a bit small. You really can't just dump the letters back in and expect to close the lid properly. You need to tweak their arrangement a bit.
2,poor quality,"i would just get plastic ones if I could do over. The paint/sticker colored coating gets messed up rather easily. If your kid chews on them at all, they will get mucked up fast."
3,not pleased,"My son got these when he was about 2. Right out of the box, some letters were de-magnatized. He enjoyed playing with them on the fridge for a while, but some of the affected letters were in his name - the first things kids usually spell. He has learned some of his letters, but I wish we had the old fashioned plastic letters."
1,Not enough letters to spell any words...and quality is so poor!,"There is 1 of every letter in upper and lower case included. This is barely enough to spell any words, and of course, very few with correct capitalization. So unless you want to invest in many kits to get enough vowels and repetitive consonants to spell a four letter word (and this set will make you want to)...don't buy this.The quality is horrible. Pressed wood that reeks of formaldehyde with a white paper layer on top and thin color paper (no paint on these).The magnet layer is thin and is not cut well, leaving many black pieces out of the box to fall all over the place.The best thing about this is the storage box it comes with, but that isn't worth the price or mess of dealing with the useless letters. Even the plastic letters are of higher quality (and seemingly safer) than these."
4,Very good,My Son is still very young so he does'nt really understand these yet but I like them alot and they shipped fast for Christmas. I could not find them anywhere so I was thankful to come across and get them here on time!
4,Nice magnet set,"I keep these on our fridge--we also have the number set. My 2 year old will stand there and point out letters he recognizes, and move them around. He seems to enjoy them! We also use them to stamp words on the Magnadoodle.I only wish there were more letters, so we could spell more words--one of each doesn't seem like enough!"
5,Great entertainment for toddlers...,My daughter loves these...my husband and I love them too. It keeps her busy while we are busy around the kitchen. Good quality is definately appreciated.
3,Melissa and doug alphabet fridge magnets,I like the magnets but wish tey had a little better magnets as tey are always all over my house. They are as described and are a great esucational tool.
2,Paper not Painted,"These did not last at all. The wooden letters are covered on one side with a thin piece of colored paper instead of being painted. The paper peels off too easily and the wood is coarsely finished which makes them easy to splinter. They do hold fairly decently on surfaces such as the refrigerator or oven door. The size of the letters are good, but some of the lower case letters are difficult to distinguish. I would not recommend this product."
3,Keep an eye on Kids Chewing The Letters,"We wanted to get big letters to put up for our 1-yr old, and this size is right. We noticed that she was chewing on one of the letters and the paper coloring came off. Just a caution to watch out for that."
3,Good but...,At first I was really excited about these letters. And truthfully my kids love them. My issue is that straight out of the box some of the thin colored wood on the front of the letters was peeling off. Now that they've been on the fridge for a few weeks even more are peeling. This was disappointing.
1,Missing the letter J,"I think this is a great toy. My kiddo loves to move them around on the fridge. However, When I put them on the fridge it order we were missing a capitol J. Boo."
2,Didnt last,"These were a gift for my granddaughter. My daughter ended up having to throw them away, the first time she cleaned them the top layer peeled off. I guess I'll need to go back to the original plastic ones with the magnets inside."
2,Missing letters,"The toy itself is actually of relatively good quality, just don't get them wet, the colors will start to peel off. I had to return this product twice to Amazon because it was missing letters! I'm not sure who assembles the product, but I'm pretty sure they don't know their ABCs!"
4,"so far, so good...","This set seems well made - though there is only 1 of each letter (upper & lower case), so it does limit your word choices some. LO loves them though!"
3,CAN'T CLEAN THESE LETTERS IN WATER,"The letters are large, the whole backside is magnetic, they are made of two pieces of wood stuck together. One piece is magnetic while the other has a piece of shiny paper stuck on it. Unfortunately, you can't wash them because the paper slowly detaches from the wood and they end up looking very ugly. I decided to remove the paper, and remained with the brown wood. If they were washable they would have been the best letters out there. My kid prefers the plastic letters because we get to clean them when they are dirty and still look attractive.I am buying another set of letters and it won't be these ones."
2,Not Typical Melissa & Doug Quality,"I have purchased many Melissa & Doug toys, because I feel quality and safety is worth the higher price tag. But I was not pleased with the magnets. All of their other wooden toys are painted, so I expected the letters to also be painted. They aren't. Instead, it is a paper lining over the letter, which easily came off into my sons mouth moments after opening the package. My friend purchased cheap plastic letters at a local store, and is much happier with hers. I wish I had done the same. For now, they are packed up until my son gets over his sucking on everything phase.If your child likes to put toys in their mouth, these letters won't hold up to the drool."
3,Don't suck them or get them wet!,"The front, colored side of these magnets is not an enamel coating as some other reviews have suggested. It's essentially a piece of colored paper, and it comes off easily if your child sucks them or gets them wet. I really liked the idea of wooden magnets, particularly because the entire back side is magnetic and doesn't pose much of a choking hazard... but if you want them to last, don't buy them for a child who is still chewing on things or likes to throw things in their water table. I really don't think they'd last through multiple children.I'll be looking for a longer lasting alternative."
3,"Nice, but too small","I expected these letters to be much bigger.The magnets are stronger than I expected which is nice. They are not prone to falling off like my previous plastic letters.On the whole though, a good product but I wish they were both bigger and had multiples (for spelling out words)."
5,finally lower case,it is easy to find the upper case but not easy to find lower case. I love the looks and material and everything. My girl love to spell things.
2,Magnetic toy is not magnetic,This magnetic toy is not actually magnetic. We have other toys by this company that are much better quality.
1,Not safe for children - Lead warnings and pieces come apart easily,"I bought this set for my son as he likes to play with our current magnets. However, he put one in his mouth for about three seconds and it started to fall apart. These magnets are supposed to be wood- but it's more like a very thin balsa wood with a thick painted paper glued on top. Not what I was expecting.On top of that, this set has a lead warning on HealthyStuff.org. It contains medium levels of lead - much higher than what is safe or even acceptable for toys.I used to really like Melissa and Doug toys when they were actually hand made in the USA. Now everything is made in China and apparently they are not keeping on top of their lead (and other toxins) levels in their toys. I won't be buying any more Melissa and Doug items.I'll be tossing this. I don't even feel comfortable sending it to Goodwill."
1,Cheaply made - Waste of money,"The first day we took this out of the package the letters began to fall apart. Some letters (such as the little i) do not even look like the letter they should be. The paint chips away and the actual wood the letters are made with peel apart from each other. Also, no little f! Cheap, cheap, cheap."
2,Can't spell mama,"The first thing my daughter wanted to do when we got these was spell ""mama"" and papa"" on the fridge. Can't do it...there seems to be only one upper case A and one lower case a, and mixing the two in a word is definitely confusing. I would have assumed most of the extra letters would be vowels. I also dislike the ""font"", if you will, because the letters don't always seem clear to me or fully representational (like ones you'd print block style if a child asked you to). I think next time I would go with an upper case only set...when she asks me, ""What's this letter?"" it's a bummer that I don't know whether to tell her it's an L or an I. I'm going to get a new set, maybe with smaller letters for actually making lots of words...she's almost three and I'm not concerned about the choking hazard issue. Honestly...if choking is an issue, your child is too young for the alphabet anyway."
1,Shoddy,"So disappointed! We received the box of wooden letters today and opened it right away. We were disappointed to find the lower case ""r"" missing. Now we're wondering if the wooden numbers set by the same company will also be incomplete. We hope Melissa and Doug will remedy this fast. We'll definitely follow up."
5,love it!,"This will keep my grandchildren busy. Helps my 4-year old granddaughter learn to spell. She searches for letters which are in her name, etc. Very educational toy."
3,Magnetic Letters,I wanted letters for the refrigerator.They are small and would not be good for a child who still puts objects in their mouth. My child did and the paint came off right away. They do fit inside a toilet paper roll so they could be swallowed. They do stick well and the magnet does not come off.
3,Kia's review,"The letters are pretty nice but unfortunately my daughter still chews on everything so they look pretty bad now. The paint is chipping, but she still plays with them."
5,Buy more than 1 set.,"I bought a set of these for my sons 2nd birthday and as soon as I opened them I ordered another set of letters and a set of numbers. If you really want to spell words with them you'll need more than one set, since you only get one upper and one lowercase of each letter. We don't always use them as magnets, sometimes it's fun to just sit on the floor and play with them!"
5,magnetic letters,Great to use on a big magnetic board. I bought this for my two yr old and she has really enjoyed playing with them.
2,cheap,"The ""behind the head"" design and low price are the best aspect about these cheap headphones.the sound quality is ok... but if you want to hear bass you're not going to like these and you will be disappointed. And unless you have a tiny head, they will hurt your skull... but i've gotten used to the pain.overall, the only reason i'm giving these two stars and not one, is the fact that they're really cheap yet actually pretty durable. i've not had any problems with the foam pads falling out, as they're actually on there pretty tight, i don't see how they would fall out unless you've got a defective pair.if you just want cheap headphones and aren't very particular, i would recommend these."
2,"Good sound, but awful fit","Onething about behind-the-neck headphones, either they get it or not. Well, Koss seems to be a company that doesn't get it.The sound of the KSC11 is pretty good. The bass isn't the deepest, but it's $10. If it were more, like $20, we would have a problem. The sound of these is truly a value.The main problem I have with these is a big one. They hurt badly. Not badly like if you move them they feel better, more like pounding someone's head. They sure are uncomfortable.Another problem with these is sound. They have a low output, making the highest volumes quiet.The sound may be good on the KSC11, but because of the comfort and output, these are unrecommeded."
1,It hurts with Bad sound and bad design,"I was looking for some cheap headphones so got these since Koss had good name in headphones. They hurt above ear when you wear them even for 2 mins. When I hooked them to my Onkyo system, the sound was bad. Only treble and no bass. Sounded like stones rattling in Tin Cans. I ordered Seinheiser HD202 with this for my office use and man ! those rock. Slightly larger than it seems in picture on most sites but the sound is so amazing that I am returning these Koss and getting those by putting some $14 extra. They even sound better than my earlier Seinheiser PX250."
2,Only one decent track,"The title track is quite nice, but the rest of the album was tedious and forgettable.I cannot recommend this CD."
5,Angel Eyes CD,Absolutely 100% satisfied with the companyand CD. Will do business with them again.Prompt e-mails concerning the order anddelivery. Product was excellent.
3,The song Jim Plays,"The song that jim plays IS Nature Boy by Jon Hassell with Ronu Majumdar as it is on the Soundtrack. If your trying to find it off the soundtrack, theres a couple different versions by him so you'll have to weed through them. I finally found it after about 2 hours of searching.."
4,The song they were dancing to,"I think the song you were thinking of is ""In a sentimental mood"" by Duke Ellington and John Coltrane. I wish they would have put that on the soundtrack! Hope this helps."
5,Bobby Bacala Baccalieri goes to Bensonhurst,"Whitebread Nicholas has to spend a couple of weeks with his grandma in Brooklyn, and gets to know his Uncle Frankie, whose existence was a deep dark family secret. In the process he learns to be a ""goomba"" and learns to cook alongside his grandma (great incentive for boys to try the recipes for various traditional dishes), how to NOT make friends, and how to get in serious trouble with the law AND the mob. One of the good things is Nicky learn to make chicken with too much oregano and it's a hit. See recipe on www.cookingupreading.com for details."
1,Shameless Ethnic Slurs for Children,"I'm appalled at the idea of these books for children.What other ethnic group is treated this way in this day and age?Why is it acceptable to denigrate people based on their origins,the vast majority of whom came to America as hard-working citizensready to help build this country?Yes the Mafia exists, even today. But every ethnic group has a criminal element. If people bothered to check their facts, they'd know thatItalians have struggled in solidarity and at great sacrifice to fight the gangs.What these books teach to children is a despicable form of prejudice, presented as lighthearted fare. What a way to educate."
1,Not recommended for adolescents,This is a handbook for juvenal delinquency and certainly not recommended for youngsters.
2,BUYER BEWARE! YOU MAY GET THE SHAFT,"This was purchased for just filming my son and daughters ball games and to try and my a more pr movie. Well after finally getting to use it time I thought well here goes and first time shooting 10 mins of SONY HIGH QUALITY PRO TAPE IT ATE THE TAPE! Well after several more try's it didn't matter it ate those tapes as well, so I had to purchase rewinders noter minDV camera to recover some of the tapes and games. When I contacted the Production company that sold me the box they assured me that there CAMERA MAN CHECKED IT OUT AND IT WORKE PURFECT, Ya right, well this is what happens when you purchase any used gear from AMAZON OR EBAY, you can and often do get burned. The cost of repairs will be 350.00 to 500.00 plus shipping and that puts the camera and all the stuff purchased at over 2400.00 GOE BUY A NEW SONY DIGITAL FOR 2000.00 and get a real PRO CAMERA."
3,XL2 blows this one away... 5+++++,"Most of you need to recheck your information, the XL2 is currently available and it is featured on the Canon.USA website and it is far beyond any panasonic or previously produced XL's. I think Canon waited a little longer to produce this gem so it would be the only one out there like it (especally for the price). I had the ability to see the quality first hand prior to the release, because I was involved in making the commercial for it (you'll see snapshots of us making the commercial in flash when you click on XL2 under camcorders). Believe me the XL2 is the one you really want..."
2,Broken,The camera showed up broken! and I am still wating on the power supply! While the school will get a replacement camera and I will not have to pay 4k for a lost camera I was not please with the shape of the equipment when it arrived and I was told by my son that it was broken. He has replaced the camera that he lost but the school will have to have it repaired.
5,High quality DV for those who know,"Just short of a top-of-the-line broadcast DV camera, the XL1S is an extremely high quality DV camcorder. It's affordable and relatively easy to operate. Granted, my parents wouldn't have the slightest clue on where to start, and for most people this is WAY too much camera for general applications. But for semi-pros and amateurs alike you cannot go wrong with this piece of equipment. All the features you could want or expect are included, and transferrance to analog or to a DV editor isn't more than a button push away. I'm a freelance videographer, and I'm starting a production house and this is the base piece of equipment I use. Too much camera for weddings and picnics, but for any type of video project this is all you need."
4,Good Enough,"As of now, the XL1S is a little outdated by some other cameras that are on the market, but the end product has very desirable results. I have used cameras like the Panasonic DVX-100, and the XL1 will suit your needs at least 90% of the time that the DVX will. There is no LCD screen, but the viewfinder does sort of double as one and the overall shape of the XL1 makes it unwieldy at times, and more convenient at other times.Overall, if you have the chance to get this camera, then go for it if something like the DVX is out of reach. The XL2 is coming out soon apparently, which will probably drop the price of this camera and it would be a great opportunity for people on a smaller budget to pick up a camera that is capable of cinema quality pictures."
5,Perfect,This was exactly what we were looking for. It was exactly as described and it shipped promptly. Thank You
1,"At Best Poor, At Worst Very Poor!","This book should be a non-starter for advanced students of Macroeconomics: poorly written, poorly thought through, difficult to follow and very closed-minded.A waste of valuable book shelf space!"
2,Good Bean Bag,"Its good bean bag meant for kids age 3 to 6 years of age. Although I bought this bean bag for my kid but he seems to find it small and he prefers to sit on my bean bag which is wider than this bean bag. Bean bag looks darker and little pale as compared to the picture. The beans are very soft which I liked. I think this bean bag is okay, except it could have been a bit wider."
5,"Compelling, entertaining, charming story.","Papa Angulee and his family make up the five whose power lies in working together like the fingers of a hand. When the homeless family encounters a very ugly troll who tries to capture them, he becomes afraid of their united strength and gives them a treasure in exchange for his life. Everything goes wrong when a greedy neighbor decides to try his family's luck with the troll -- and returns with a treasure beyond jewels! Shakta Kaur Khalsa's The Five Fingered Family is a compelling, entertaining, highly recommended story of family unity that is charmingly illustrated by Siri-Karter Khalsa in the style of a 16th century Mughal painting, rendered with an Indian sense of color reminiscent of Rajput 18th century miniatures."
3,"Nice for battery life, but not for video","If you simply want to extend the battery life of your PSP without having to change and manage multiple batteries, then this case if perfect for you. The case barely adds any size or weight, and you can still play games easily while it is in the case, although if the lid was removable it would have been a little easier.The biggest disappointment is that, unlike the Logitech plastic case (which doesn't come with an internal battery), this case can not be set up in an angled display position for watching movies. So if you want to watch a movie in a plane or something, you'll have to hold it up at an angle yourself. All they had to do was make the lid go back a little farther and put a thin strip of rubber on it, and this case would have been perfect. I'm astounded that they would overlook this simple and very functional feature for a device that is becoming used more and more as a movie player."
3,Nyko Charger Case for PSP,"The case and the connections are a little clumsy. The outsdie rubber flap to connect the charger or the PSP is hard to open. on the other hand, the inside connector for the PSP to utilize the built-in battery is coming off to easily.The case provides good protection, extended battery life (I watched two movies and never used the PSPs own battery) and the capability to charge both, case and PSP, at the same time.I store my PSP in it and always have it with me on the road because it offers the extra battery life and good protection. However playing ganes in ihe box is cumbersome."
4,Very Handy,"I like this quite a bit. It works very well. The case has a very secure feel, only thing really lacking is a place to store games. The price is a tad high, but I would highly recommend it."
4,This case ROCKS!!!,"These cases do EXACTLY what they say. They add about 7 hours of battery life to your PSP. A flip holder isn't a huge deal as they come with a power cable that can run from the case to your PSP, or it charges it while you are not using it.This has saved my boredom on many a long trip. Protects the PSP. Charges the PSP. Brilliant!One word of warning, though, is not to pay more than $20. I can go into any GameStop and buy one for that price. I see them for $50 and there is no way."
3,Great for Travel,This product is great for long trips however if you want a convenient day to day case for your psp this is not the one. All the other reviews are correct too big/bulky/awkward. If you don't have really large hands you can't play games very well with your psp in the case. Which really defeats the purpose of having this case. I rated it a 3 because I have big hands and travel alot.
5,You must read this book,"I found this book to be wonderful. It is very well written. It holds your attention and get so caught up in following the story line anticipating what is going to happen next. I think that we can all relate to the different characters in the book. Whether it is a personal correlation or we know someone that fits the description. I think McCann is a talented writer and has a bright future ahead of him. If you are looking for a beautiful breath-taking novel to read this is the one for you. I am anxiously awaiting the release of his next book ""For Always""."
4,Familiar,"Until.....is a very engaging story with a familiar feeling. While reading I get the feeling I should join in the conversations. It is REAL. More brothers should write books like this. I usually read on the train going to work. While reading Chapter 5, I missed my stop and had to circle back. If McCann has any more books coming out, I want to be at the head of the line. T.M. - Job well done."
5,"With ""Until"" You Cannot Be Disappointed.....","I ""post a note"" indicating how reading ""Until"" has touched my soul. I pen this note to notify the readers how incredible a writer I believe Mr. McCann to be. The characters are all people we know, whether dear friends or distant acquaintances.""Until"" is a book about hope. There is a scripture in Proverbs that says ""Hope deferred maketh the heart sick."" And the readers of ""Until"" can all attest to having experienced the sinking feeling of disappointment of a love that once was, but is now beyond our outstretched grasp.Feel the words of ""Until"" and empathize with the men and women inside the pages. Know the depth of ""Until"". Observe and understand how ""Until"" always motivates you to go on. Because we all want ""Until"" to become our reality.I didn't know that I could miss a book, ""Until""....With ""Until"" you cannot be disappointed......"
5,Timmothy McCann does a masterful job speaking for women,I now consider Betty and Jaqui two of my best friends. I carried this book with me everywhere. I read thru stop lights and traffic jams. I look forward to McCann's next novel.
5,Wonderful!,"I am so proud of the writings of this new talent. Once I started reading the book, I just could not stop. His sensitivity to the characters was so overwhelming because he made them seem so real. To be able to write female characters with such depth is to be commended, there are some female writers who cannot do that. He wrote of pain, love, disappointment and betrayal, which everyone can relate to. No male or female bashing. This is a wonderful story of young people surviving and waiting Until they reach their potential whether it be love, work or even friendship. A great read for all. Thank you Timmothy for such an inspirational start. I cannot wait until the next book!"
2,Predictable,"Until wasn't the worst thing that I've read, but it was far from great. The novel was written more like a poorly written romance novel. McCann had some good story ideas and some touching moments in the book, but overall I found the book boring and predictable--I knew what was going to happen before I got half way through the book. I just could not feel anything for the charachters. For those of you who found the book great and realistic, I suggest that you try Cheaters by EJ Dickey, Waiting in Vain by Colin Channer, Cup of Love by Franklin White, or If This World Were Mine by E. Lynn Harris. Nevertheless, with time I believe that McCann will produce good work."
3,SOMEBODY HELP ME.....,I MUST HAVE MISSED SOMETHING! The other reviewers gave this this 5 stars and I couldn't wait to read it. I was very disappointed! The story was fast paced and entertaining but not what I expected.
3,SOME MEN ARE FROM VENUS.....,"or Timmothy has a season ticket to this planet. It is amazing to find a man that can write about women's issues from a female perspective, how does he do it? While it is a romantic book, it isn't mushy, I can't remember the last time I felt so relaxed reading a book like this.The characters are true to form and it is so refreshing to see people over 30 portrayed as having a life and not dead from the neck down. I have to say I loved the ""Bad"" characters most, you could dislike them and still feel something for them, Timmothy protrays them as real individual's and not ""Darth Vadar ice water-for-blood-unreal-cut-outs""The situation's are so real that I'm tempted to look at it as a semi-autobiography, fiction or true-to-life, it works for me."
4,True love story,Until by Timmothy McCann is a great book for people who love to love and be loved. A very powerful and moving story of how two people find love when they thought that it was impossible. A must read!
2,Am I Missing Something...?,"Once I read all the great reviews this book had gotten I decided to get. While reading this book it started off slow for me, but I thought it would pick up because of all the great reviews. But maybe it was just me because I could barely get through it. I had to keep putting it down because I was getting bored. And once I reached the ending I was too through. I had to check twice to see if there were any more pages. This was my first time reading this author, and so far I am not impressed."
4,For romantics,"If you are a romantic, you will enjoy UNTIL. If you believe that people can find one another in the most unusual circumstances read UNTIL. If you believe that people find love after finding friendship, read UNTIL.In addition to the romance, UNTIL provides a great deal of information about friendship, be they male and female or female and female friends; relationshps on various levels such as parent and child and husbands and wives, and for those of you who are somewhat seasoned in age and in long term relationships, it gives a glimpse into the dating game of today.Finally, a lesson can be learned from this story about following your instincts! It was an enjoyable read, easy to digest and one I would recommend to others."
5,Beautiful!!!,"There is few men that can write on a woman's heart and feelings, and Timmothy MCCann is one of them. I loved this book. It is romantic, beautiful, and empowering as well. It was good to meet the author on his recent book tour, and I recommend that if your thinking of a book, buy this one..You won't be disappointed."
4,a good read for avid readers,"I enjoyed the book. i had been waiting on it to come out. I checked the book out of the library, but i will have my own copy tomorrow. It started a little slow, but i was hooked. and i will continue reading Timmothy B. McCann"
5,"""UNTIL"" is a masterpiece!","After checking out the novel ""UNTIL"" I must truly say that it is a masterpiece. Each chapter takes you into a place in life. Either where I have been before personally. Or can relate to because of friends experiences they've weathered through. The characters are so believable it hits home. I am so intrigued by this novel until I have given the novel to seven other friends as gifts. Now they are hooked.Both male and female now call me at work. And ask me can I believe what this character said to whom etc... [LOL] Timmothy you have been blessed with a god given talent my brother. Please hurry up and give us another novel ASAP. Ladies and gentlemen this novel is a must read for sure.I give it twenty stars if I could. God Bless everyone Jenean A"
5,Beautiful...,"Have you ever experienced something so beautiful and words were no where to be found, only an aahhh? Well, this is how I felt when I finished reading this book. I was also inspired to hold on, not give up and wait until...I recommend this one for anyone who stills believe in some good ole fashion L O V E love."
4,Excellent and Very Inviting!,I truly enjoyed reading Until! The book had my emotions going (there were times when I laughed out loud and times when I felt very sad) so in order to do that you know it must be a good book! I look forward to reading more of Tim's work in the future. One happy reader from California :)
3,Slow But Moving,"The first 3 chapters had me somewhat confused as to who the main characters were going to be because they talked about Betty and Evander in away that led me to beleive he was a main character not a supporting one. Not until the end of chapter 4 did I get the since that it was Drew and Betty. It too long to get to the hook. After chapter 4 I couldn't wait to see what was going to take place next. If we could all have a friend to talk to the way Betty and Drew did, before they finally met each other. I am going to start reading the sequel Forever tonight, I only hope it gets off to as better start."
4,Wonderful,"I'm on the last chapter and I knew that I had to write a comment about this book. I laughed, cried, and said mmmmm too many times. The brother is on point as for as I am concerned. I recommend that all my sisters who are readers pick up this book. Share it with a friend, share it with another brother. The Brother is telling my story and I am sure a lot of sisters will agree that he's telling their story as well. Mr. McCann-are-you-married?"
4,Pretty Good.,"I have to admit that I really enjoyed this novel. Timmothy pulled this off, for it to be his first novel. There is no doubt that I will read his new novel ""always"". The story had a really good twist and it keep me guessing if and when Betty and Drew were going to get together. The story is good. Take your time and read this book, and don't give up on it."
2,"Excuse me, Excuse me, Excuse me, Excuse me, Excuse me, Excus",Am I missing the plot here. Sweet Jesus on the cross. I have never been more bored reading a book in all my life. Wasn't it page 83 before the reader was introduced to DLast Romeo again. Page Turner ???? I couldn't wait for the book to finish. I don't even want to add insult to injury by counting how many pages involved DLast Romeo and the main character. I would say that it is a different kind of romance book but the author is taking a big risk assuming that the average reader has the patience to stick with the book to the end. I mean the ending - straight out of a trashy romance novel.What did i think ? - I wasn't impressed at all.
4,Two Thumbs Up!,"Finally! A black romance novel that doesn't make the leading female's sole purpose in life to get a man. This is a novel about a professional black female and a professional black male. Both looking for love and finding it in one another. It covers hardship and triumph. I loved it. I admit it was kind of slow at the beginning, but once it got good, it stayed good. The slow beginning is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, but it's still a great novel."
4,Until - promising,"This book starts out slow, but don't stop reading. Enjoyable, real, you identify with the characters. Very good read"
2,Got to agree with the negatives on this one,"Until tries to deviate from the standard romance novel formulas in a couple of ways. First, it moves a real-life encounter into an unforseen internet ""You've Got Mail"" style relationship. Secondly, it works hard to postpone the in-person relationship building work until the end. That didn't make much sense to me, and I felt Evander was overdeveloped and Drew was underdeveloped.Lawyers might like this better than me because Betty wrestles with some interesting issues at work as she tries to make partner on her gig.The backdrop outside of the relationship didn't do but so much for me, and I would have liked to see this book continue a bit more after they met. Wouldn't be surprised if the author wrote this with plans for a sequel. Unfortunately, based on this experience I wouldn't get around to picking it up.2 stars--SD"
4,Love through a man's eyes,"Okay, this is my first time reading this brother and I have to say, he has a way of keeping you interested. I read this book in two days. Now I am going out to get the sequel to this. I truly enjoyed it and I can see one could get wrapped in wanting to be in love. This is book is must read."
2,Lackluster,"Did I read the same book as the other reviewers? I found ""Until"" slow moving and sometimes dull. The main characters, Betty and Drew, are likable, but are not fully fleshed-out individuals. Betty, a strong, intelligent career woman, seems to have trouble trusting her heart and giving herself in a relationship - but why? Drew suffers hearbreak over a lost love, but the reader is never clear as to whether that love was fully reciprocated.Betty and Drew both make attempts to find love and affection in the arms of others while developing an on-line friendship. The predictable ending is anti-climactic and fails to give the reader a true payoff for keeping with this sloooooow tale."
5,The book is very real and very moving!,I could not put it down. I have never known a man before who has such great insights into what a woman is feeling. With every page I was drawn more into the characters lives. I laughed and at times cried as I read this wonderful piece of literature. I am waiting with much anticipation for the next book my Mr. McCann.
4,Pleasantly surprising,"I didn't know what to expect when I first heard from McCann via email that he was getting into the romance industry, my first reaction was 'that's odd' simply because that's a side that most men don't show. You can't judge a book by its cover! McCann tells this cyber-love story wonderfully. We've all been down those romantic roads a time or two in our lives; if only all of us could end up with such joy and successes. What I liked most is that you McCann makes you feel like you are a fly on the wall - there during the whole thing. Can't wait Until..."
5,A breath of fresh air,"This was a novel that I stumbled upon while I was on a desperate search for something to read. I received a gift. This book practically mirrors my relationship with my husband. Mr McCanns' words are so powerful and so sweet, they really touched my soul. I eagerly await his next offering. Timm, you inspire me!"
2,McRae's voice is always a joy to hear...,"...However this is the last McRae Cd to get, dated arragements oddball tunes, start with her Decca material, and also get her tribute to Billie Holiday CD on Columbia records, but for Gosh sakes stay away fro mthis one."
3,Smells great but...,The soap has a nice smell and is really good at exfoliating. That being said it is black in color and makes a mess of your tub or shower.
4,Strong,"Strong introduction to Jaffe's poetry. Raw, quick read. No surprises, just heartfelt words by a heartfelt poet. Much less political than his other work."
5,Perfect running shoe for the right feet,I had my foot fitted at a running store and this is the shoe they said would be a good match for my foot and gait. It is wonderful...no breaking in. Highly recommended if you know this is the right shoe for you.
4,Good shoe - but not exactly what the page suggests,"I am a 3 time marathoner, and I have run all my races in Brooks Radius shoes. I love them. I was looking to save a little money and buy on Amazon instead of at a running store, and I was delighted to find these for $20 cheaper than store price. I hadn't seen this color in the store, so I figured maybe this was just last year's model. However, when I got the shoe I noticed that the tongue said ""Radius Cushion"". Nowhere on the site did it say that this was the 'cushion' version as opposed to the neutral version. I still like the shoe, it fits very well, but I have had a bit more trouble with shin splints because this shoe is a little less rigid than the ones I was used to wearing. As long as you're ok with a cushioned shoe, this one is perfect!"
3,Operator Error - time zone CAN be set permanently,"My first review of this clock said that it jumps time zones on a whim and temp changes back to Centigrade. I find that after re-reading the instructions, I can set the time zone to USA permanently, which I did. After many weeks, I have had no problem at all. I would change my stars to 4 if I could, but Amazon doesn't seem to allow that.I do like the design of this clock. It's thin, easy to pack and batteries are easily accessible. However, the face doesn't stay lighted so if you wake up in the night, you must touch the snooze/light button to view. Awkward, but batteries last a long longer that way."
1,Almost impossible to read,"An attractive package, but this clock is rather difficult to read during the day unless the light and angle are just right. At night it is invisible unless you can reach out and touch the button on the top, at which time it glows blue so brightly that it is again almost impossible to read until your eyes adjust."
4,Loud!,I like the time sync and push-button backlight but the alarm is really loud. Might be helpful for some but I am trying to figure out how to quiet it a bit. Would also be nice if it had 2 or 3 alarm settings.
3,Seiko Alarm Clock,"I like the alarm clock, but I find the alarm is too loud. It wakes everyone in the house besides me. Is there any way to turn it down? Also, I lost the instructions for setting the alarm, and I find it is difficult to figure out how to set the alarm for a different time."
2,"Some Good, Some Not So Much",The good: Keeps accurate time.The Bad: Works only on battery. Display is off unless a button is pushed which the manufacturer says will run down the battery.Not a wnner.
5,Extremely useful resource,"All English teachers should have this ""companion"". It offers fantastic exemplars and student friendly language. I can't wait until they complete the revised edition and add the updates."
4,Excellent IR Text,"Valji's Vascular and Interventional Radiology is an excellent, highly readable and mostly up-to-date textbook which will be very useful to radiology residents.My sole complaint (and it's significant) is about the figures. In most cases there are no arrows and the captions are often quite vague, just mentioning the type of finding in the figure without providing specific anatomic localization. The net effect is to sometimes leave you searching the pictures to even find the abnormality! Certainly it means that, unlike with many radiology texts, it's hard to just ""look at the pictures"" and their captions and ignore the text of this book.All in all, I think this is a very good book, mostly because the text is so well-written. But I do think that the captions could be expanded in future editions and arrows added to some of the figures to highlight key findings."
5,For Those Interested in the Seedier Side of America,"""Chump Change"" is an emotional slice of life that cuts below the skin, exposing the bare sinew of the American psyche. Definitely worth reading for anyone who is interested in knowing what makes the desperate American tick."
4,Buk with more fluidity.,"I bought this book for $4, thinking nothing of it. It wasn't until I started reading (I finished it in a night) that I realized its gut-wrenching realism.Read it with a strong stomach and a fresh pack of smokes by your side."
4,must be popular the world over...,"...I first heard it while riding in a taxi cab in Seoul.Enjoyable ""world music,"" takes songs from a variety of sources and then applies modern pop music gloss. Closest referents Ofra Haza and rai. Not up to Don Was - Khaled standard in terms of either the hooks or inventiveness of the arrangements, still enjoyable ""crossover"" appeal. One song in English, brief translations of the Hebrew lyrics into English in the accompanying booklet."
3,VERY COMPLICATED.....,"IF U WANT TO LEARN ABOUT THE UNABOMBER & ALL HIS BACKGROUND, EVEN INTO HIS FRIENDS, HIS POLITICAL VIEWS, WHAT SCHOOL HE ATTENDED, WHERE HE LIVED, WHAT DEGREE HE HAD, ETC....THIS IS THE BOOK FOR U. I FOUND THE BOOK VERY LONG & BORING. I DO NOT THINK IT EVER EVEN DESCRIBED THE EXACT DEEDS & RESULTS OF HIS EFFORTS VERY DETAILED. IT ALL WAS TANGLED IN A VERY COMPLICATED CORE...NOT WHAT I EXPECTED AT ALL. A DEFINATE PUT TO SLEEP BOOK..."
2,Using the Unabomber,"When I started reading this book, I was enthusiastic...but if this is the best book about Kaczynski, it's only because they are all bad. There are interesting bits of information here, but the bits are never developed into detailed facts or believable theories about Kaczynski's life.Instead Chase uses the subject as a way to write yet another diatribe against environmentalists. According to Chase, ""Restoring 'pre-Columbian conditions' and 'recreating the primitive scene' had become national policy, pursued by all federal land management agencies, including the U.S. Forest Service, the National Park Service, and the Bureau of Land Management."" (p. 99)By the time I managed to stop laughing at the ludicrousness of that comment, I wasn't able to take any of Chase's opinions in the book seriously."
3,"The Essence of Taiji Qigong, second edition",Overall satisfactory. The pictures were hard to follow in this book. This was a required text for a Taiji class I had so between the book and the professor the forms were not too hard to learn. I wouldn't recommend this book for someone to learn Taiji without the help of a teacher to accompany it :)
5,Great Film!,"I'm a giant cyberpunk fan, and a Blade Runner fanatic. So when this movie was referred to as 'A Korean Blade Runner' I had to own it. It is a great film, almost a cross between Blade Runner and The Matrix. Superb visual effects, and a solid DTS soundtrack. It is in Korean however so if you don't like subtitles you may not like it. But it is a solid example of Korean film potential and definitely worth a look."
4,Reminded me of Blade Runner,"The plot was very good.The scenery reminded me of Blade Runner.Overall, very enjoyable, if you can take dealing with subtitles."
1,Don't waste your time.,This Blade Runner wannabe is a complete dud. The bloody fighting at the end is completely unnecessary. It is one of the worst Korean movies I have watched. What a waste of my life.
4,interestingly wierd,"Very wierd and interesting movie, have never seen blade runner though (which is what this movie is compared to), a little hard to follow at first but a good sci-fi thriller!!"
1,What a disappointment!,"This movie is a real disappointment.It is based on ""Blade Runner"", but lacks all the deep ideas that made Blade Runner so good. Blade Runner is full with violence, true, but the violence is for the purpose of the movie. Here, the violence is just for ""action"", and does not serve the movie at all.It is just bad another action movie that uses Blade Runner as a makeup."
2,A disappointing reading,"""Simon Vance's delivery is understated ..."" is an understatement! Sadly, this reading is nowhere near as entertaining as a reading by Martin Jarvis, Jonathan Cecil orIan Carmichael. The story is excellent, but I recommend reading the book instead of listening to this particular audio presentation. But with the right readers (identified above) Wodehouse stories can be fantastic accompaniments to travel or other activities during which you'd rather listen to, than read, the stories."
5,My favourite P.G book,Oh my gosh where do I begin a complicated love story all because of money I am a huge fan of his books and this one takes the cake the funny moments he puts the characters through the irony and last but not least the weird happenings bringing togther the perfect pair for one another if loved Love Among the Chickens then you will love this book!
3,No 7 Rubbing Compound not what it use to be,"I ordered this rubbing compound because I had an old can (about 20 years old)that worked great removing the oxidation from an old car. I tried purchasing another brand locally but it did not work as well as the No. 7. Well, the new formula of No. 7 is not the same as the old one as it did not remove the oxidation as well as the old one. It worked OK but I can tell the difference between the parts of the car that I used the old on versus the new can. I assume that it is something that they had to remove due to environmental regulations."
4,FUN book!,I love this book and bought several for gifts. The book is hilarious and the recipes sound so absolutely delicious!!! Even the way she writes the recipes is funny.
3,different,"The book is funny at points. I expected more recipes. I listened to the audio version, read by the author herself. She employs liberal use of the callback, so much so that she latches on to a few key phrases and repeats them to the point of browbeating. The recipes are sickening. I could barely stand to listen. If those women actually eat that way, it's no wonder they are all saving for lipsuction. If I heard her say ""one runningoverteaspoon of vanilla"" one more time, I was gonna find her and punch her in the face. Just say a teaspoon and a half of vanilla! The part about her mother having a stroke makes her seem incredibly selfish and coldhearted. Maybe being dispassionate is just her way of coping."
2,More suitable for sweet potato queens than me.,"Buy with care. Not a bad book, I suppose, but if you buy it and then find it's not really for you, who are you going to give it to? Suffice to say, my wife's English is not good enough to understand the humour of the title, but not poor enough to do anything other than take my gift as an insult."
5,Not just for 4 and up...,"I've given this book (and its earlier editions) often as a new-baby gift for babies in the US and abroad. I feel that it's a great present for non-native speakers, because of all the words you only learn in your native language!My granddaughter, age 22 months has loved it for about the last year, as have other very young children I know. For a while, she called it ""a book"" -- that is, the only one she really acknowledged. She's now branched out to other books but still enjoys identifying the photos in this one. She doesn't care if they're obscure, she likes discussing them, and her favorite pages vary over time. Like the other reviewers, I'll soon be buying a new copy as the first one is wearing out. Maybe the publisher should consider a hard-page edition."
5,Here's what I missed in my other review!,"I neglected to mention that we own two copies of this book. My daughter's is so worn with use and has enough pages torn by her toddler hands that we purchased a second one for my son. Also, I agree with the reviewer who described using the book by focusing on the familiar and temporarily skipping over other topics. We did/do this as well. Eventually, however, our children have come to enjoy the entire book, and have definitely learned from it."
2,This is not about information graphics,"I bought this book looking for examples of transmitting useful information graphically. But in the entire book, I can only find one page about that: the map on page 17. The other 207 pages of this book are strictly about traditional graphic design, by which I mean graphics going for emotional impact, not informational. Just look at the chapter headings:Chapter 1: Publication Identity SystemsChapter 2: Posters and Other PromotionsChapter 3: Logos and StationaryChapter 4: IllustrationsChapter 5: Holiday GreetingsAdvertising, posters, logos, catalogs. As a book about graphic design, it might be okay. But putting the words ""Information Design"" is a blatant lie. I recommend you read something by Tufte instead."
1,Should be titled Main Roads!,Disapointing for us Jeep drivers who think a Backroad is off the beaten track and NOT paved! These may seem like backroads if one is from LA or NY but these are really (allmost) all paved main highways here in Canada. For RV tourists only.
1,Don't buy this VCR,"This is a VCR that could have been made by a company that had never used one nor made one before.The fast forward in the play mode is way too slow, the slow is really a frame by frame and the pause reacts so slowly that it is almost impossible to get it to stop where you want it to.The machine is lightweight and has smooth feet so when you push any of the buttons on the VCR the machine just slides backward. In other words, you have to hold the VCR in place with one hand and push a button with the other or velco it in place. No problem, you might say, cause I'll use the remote all the time. My remote functions started to fail after one month and at two months it became unusable.I called Sony's 'we are here to help' phone number several times but could never get through.This is a bush league machine made by a company that knows better.............."
4,WORKS FOR ME,"I've had this VCR since 2003, about a year now. It works fine. It records when programmed. It plays back. The picture is fine. If you want better quality picture: buy DVD. I use this VCR to record TV and play older tapes of recorded from TV documentaries and some store bought tapes. No problems. Only negatives: no random channel search. You have to use the up/down buttons to scroll through the channels. No biggie. Also fast forward/rewind are very fast so when you press stop the tape keeps moving for a while. Again, no biggie. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is nothing is perfect."
2,Fast rewind but bad remotes,Fast rewind and forward speeds are great for skipping from one program to another but stopping at a desired spot is frustrating. The remote it terrible. After one month it stopped working. Sony site said to remove the batteries and then press each button twice. This fix lasted about 5 minutes. You must constantly remove the battery and put it back in to get the remote to work. Just programing the VCR is a chore with this remote- removing and replacing the battery for almost every programing item. I bought a new identical Sony remote and it developed the same problem in about a week!
5,Sony VCR,THis product has always been the highest quality in VCRs. This particular one is functioning as I expected so far and I expect it to continue to function in a quality way.
1,I'd be afraid of any Sony product after this one!,"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! I stupidly bought two of these (for two rooms) and they're both garbage. To use the remote, you must constantly juggle the batteries (even after just inserting new ones with very distant expiration dates). You have to juggle the batteries (even right after installing them) several times during a 30-minute program. I've never had this many problems with a VCR -- but I never bought Sony before. After this, I never will again!"
1,A rental,Love Vince Vaughn and the wife loves Reece. Do yourself a favor and rent this one don't buy...
1,Only the Gringe could like this pityful movie,"I have nothing to say concerning this movie's plot, there wasn't one. I will say that it's not a movie intended for children. In fact, it's not a movie intended for anyone that appreciates good humor, warmth, drama, or the Christmas spirit. The film takes talented actors and provides them a vehicle that must leave them shamefaced and embarrassed. My wife and I saw this in the theater, walked out after the ""third"" Christmas. If this movie does anything for your holiday spirit, it will destroy it. It's sad to see what some actors will do to make a buck. If you receive this as a Christmas gift, please don't watch it. Instead, include it with the wrapping and boxes intended for the fireplace."
4,Borderline,We forgot how many adult scenes there are in the beginning. After that the kids thought it was funny too.
4,Four Christmases,To believe that some people really don't connect to their families. I think we all need to realise what is important in Life.
2,Christmas Nightmare with Vince Vaughn,"My Title says it all. My Wife and I sat down to watch a Christmas movie together and decided to rent this.I wish I could get my 1hr and 29 mins back. This movie is bad, only reason I gave it 2 stars was Reese Witherspoon.Vaughn still can't act his way out of a paper bag and the rest of the cast was painful to watch. If you want a funnyChristmas movie to rent on Amazon check out Surviving Christmas with Ben Affleck."
2,tedious,"predictable, and not all the funny. Reese as always, looks beautiful. I thought this movie would get us in the holiday spirit, but not really. Skip it."
3,Not that funny,If you saw the trailer then you've seen all this movie has to offer. The leads have no chemistry and the story lacks any real emotion. All the laughs have been drilled into your head by the trailers so there was nothing left to laugh at.
4,"EXTREMELY PREDICTABLE, BUT VERY FUNNY!","'Four Christmases' is the kind of film that offers nothing new, but because of some hilarious performances feels better than if should be. We all know where this film is going from the word go, but Vaughn, Witherspoon and an wide assortment of stars playing their families just go all out and score big on the laugh meter. Even though this film is in a Christmas setting, I didn't feel it to be a ""Holiday"" film. I think this film can be enjoyed anytime of year. 4 stars is probably a little too high of a rating, but I haven't laughed this hard in a while! Thanks FM and Andrew for pointing this one out to me! ;-)"
4,Four Christmases,This was a great comedy. It had some really hysterical. It was full of action. Reese Witherspoon and Vince Vaughn were perfect for this movie.
3,Passable,"Let me start by saying I LOVE Vince Vaughn and will pretty much watch any movie he is in, crappy or not. What I won't do is base a review on the fact that I adore him. That out of they way, let's review!I missed this one in the theater and have to say I am glad I did, as it had it's funny moments but not fall on the floor laughing the entire movie funny. Reese does a great job as she seems to always do and she and Vince do have chemistry, the problem seems to be the movie itself. It seems rushed and cliche. You have great actors (Robert Duvall, Jon Voight) and yet the whole movie goes just the way you expect.3 stars for the few laughs..."
3,ANY PLACE BUT HOME,"The cast is what makes this movie work. We've got five Oscar winners: Reese Witherspoon, Robert Duvall, Sissy Spacek, Jon Voight, and Mary Steenburgen. One Emmy/Tony winner: Kristen Chenowith. Two Grammy winners: Tim McGraw and Dwight Yoakam, and the irrepressible Vince Vaughn.The movie has some funny scenes and for every cliche, there's an original twist to compensate. Although the dysfunctional families certainly aren't uplifting, there is some kind of happiness by the movie's end. But the stellar casting is the film's bonus."
2,Good cast bad story,"We love the actors in this movie, but the story really wasn't that great and there wasn't a redeeming factor at the end."
4,Better than most holiday fare,"While I doubt any of the actors received an Oscar for performances in this movie - it was an enjoyable holiday themed movie. the cast is certainly star studded and they seemed to have a good time making the movie - hey all fit their roles well.Believe me, when it comes to 'Christmas' movies, you can do much worse. Vince Vaughn always seems to have some regular actors who follow him in movies, and this one's no exception to that rule. There are a few scenes I wouldn't watch with the younger kids around, but most of it is pretty tame.It was funny, I laughed out loud at least a handful of times and would watch it again."
4,Good Holiday DVD,This DVD arrived on time and in great condition. I loved this sleeper of a movie. Husband and wife make up stories why they cannot spend Christmas with their families. Of course their lies backfire on them.
3,"Enjoyable, all over romance.","Cute romance comedy, a little outlandish and unrealistic, but's an enjoyable watch. Typical Vince Vaughn movie, and Reese Witherspoon is fun and firey in her character."
4,Had me laughing,I wasn't expecting this movie to be as funny as it was because the title was unknown to me. It ended up that I bought it because I felt we HAD to own it.
2,Very little to like about this movie,"It has a few funny moments, but overall just feels like a forced premise and Vince Vaughn's stereotypical acting and fast talking humor gets old about 5 minutes in. Robert Duvall is hilarious though."
2,Christmas Catastrophe,"Oh boy. Let me say I usually like Vince Vaughan and Reese Witherspoon and I love holiday movies. These three apparently don't mix well, though. This movie has no real direction and poor editing. There is no real connections made between any of the characters, including Vince and Reese. Save your time and watch Elf again, for the hundredth time--it will be much more enjoyable!"
2,About a bunch of Scrooges...,"There is absolutely nothing redeeming about this movie - the characters are unbelievably annoying, demanding and unlikeable. Christmas takes the back seat to petty arguments and drama. Nothing to recommend about this one."
4,Pretty good for a girl movie,"bought this movie for my wife, thought it was going to be a girl movie but it wasn't too bad."
3,Buy it used,I would say this movie is worth buying albeit used. One thing that disappointed me was there are no bonus features! None. Just the movie. I was hoping they'd add deleted scenes and an alternate ending.There are some very funny moments in this movie but then there are places where you want to fast forward and just go to the next scene.It's not your typical holiday movie which is nice.
4,Vaughn At His Best,"Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon will make you crap yourself with laughter. Seriously, you should wear a diaper when you watch this."
2,"Ok, with a few laughs","There were a few laughs to be had, but I had a lot of trouble feeling much for the characters, and it barely resembled Christmas in any form I have ever experienced. Who has a bounce house with all the kids in the neighborhood in it on Christmas day?"
2,Lame,I chose this because it was Christmas and had Reese Witherspoon. It had a sort of good ending but overall tacky for a Christmas movie and for her caliber of acting.
5,4 Christmases,"I loved this movie when I saw it in the theatre. It's hilarious, and a welcome addition to my Christmas movie collection."
3,Movie Rental,Wife wanted to watch the videa but you can't find it on Netflix or anywhere for free so we rented it. Okay movie.
5,Great movie. Good for the entire family.,This movie is hysterical. I haven't had this much fun with the intire family at Christmas. We highly endorse this movie.
1,Terrible Movie...I wish there was only 1 christmas so it would be over,This movie had bad acting and writing. I couldn't believe that this was actually funded...and that I paid $4 so support movies like this. Throughout most of the show I thought this looked like a bad made for TV movie.
2,It's okay...,"This film did not impress me. I read some reviews beforehand, and figured that it wasn't a masterpiece by any means.It feels like it was thrown together at the last minute, and both of the leads look totally bored most of the time. Don't get me wrong, there were some really funny moments in the film, but unfortunately, most of the film was rather weak, even stupid. You can tell that Vince Vaughn tries to save the day through improvisation.See it if you have nothing else to do, or you could just wait for the DVD, which is what I wish that I had done."
1,A Holiday Turkey,"This film was a bitter disappointment. I would give it zero stars if that was an option. Not even the usually wonderful Reese Witherspoon could save this holiday turkey. To be fair, neither Vaughn nor Witherspoon had a lot to work with, script-wise. The opening scene is crude and strange, and seems very out of place in what is being marketed as a ""holiday movie"". The closing scene just rehashes one of the main opening ""jokes"". The remaining middle of the film is a mess of crude, Farrelly Brothers type ""humor"" mixed with hokey sentiment. I found the church scene particularly offensive and I'm not especially religious. I'd hate to think how offensive other viewers may have found it. Not even cameos by Jon Voight and Sissy Spacek could save this film. There are a wealth of really wonderful holiday movies - this isn't one of them. Please save your $$ and purchase a tried and true holiday classic and stay away from this utter turkey."
1,SANTA CLAUS SPOILER!!!,"DO NOT LET CHILDREN SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!!! I heard it was a fun family movie so we rented it. In the first five minutes, there are cuss words, sexual references, and a steamy makeout scene. It is horrible. I told my daughter to close her eyes, and then we continued to watch once that scene was over. About halfway through, it says that Santa Claus is not real! My daughter ran away crying!!!!!!!! Even I did not enjoy it. The ""humor"" was not funny, just ridiculous. Do yourself a favor and rent ""Elf"" for a fun family movie. ""Four Christmases"" is ABSOLUTELY AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Even for a lame chick flick it sucks hard.,"This movie is stupid, pointless, boring, runs on and on, is not funny, gets annoying and is just a total mess. These type of movies sucks anyway but this is one of the worst I have had the displeasure of watching. Vince Vaughn & Reese play the same boring roles they play in every movie they are in....lame."
5,HILARIOUS!,"My husband and I haven't laughed this hard watching a movie for years. Vince Vaughn is a revelation; Reese Witherspoon, who seems more comfortable with tightly scripted - rather than ad libbed - comedy, spends most of the movie looking out of her comedic league. Priceless perceptions on dysfunctional families."
1,Horrible,"I was forced to watch this movie on a recent bus trip. Sure, I get the idea... two yuppies whose families are so awful they lie to avoid getting together with them for the holidays (and instead treat themselves to selfish tropical vacations) only to realize in the end that love can't be controlled or categorized. OK, not a bad premise, but the main characters are unlikeable, self obsessed jerks. The movie is full of sterotyping, gratuitous violence and cursing, even by children. Is the acting good? Who would even care. I wish I could erase the memory of this from my brain."
1,four christmasses bore christmasses,"This was stupid. I tried to watch it but could only take about 15 minutes of it before I turned it off. Two selfish people are forced to inflict themselves on their families for the holidays. Had good potential but it failed in the execution.If Robert Duval, Reese Witherspoon and the other quality actors could not save the story nothing could. Don't believe in book burning but I might consider burning this movie to save some future innocent person from having it inflicted upon them."
1,ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!!!!!,"I am easy to please, but this has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen! I don't think I laughed once. It was disturbing, stupid and quite ""racy"" in spots, there is a lot of sexual talk. I would not want my 13 year old watching it.Don't waste your time."
2,"I was screaming ""Mistletoe!"" ten minutes into this film.","A lot of people told me that this was a terrible movie, but I really like Vince Vaughn and Reece Witherspoon, so I figured ""Four Christmases"" couldn't be THAT bad. Well, I was wrong. It is downright awful. Vince and Reece do the best job they can with a terrible script that reads more like a horror movie than a holiday comedy. There are a few humorous moments, but for the most part, I shuddered throughout the entire film, wondering what horrible things would happen to these poor people next. The one good thing about the movie is that it's super short, so if you do decide to be brave and watch it, you won't have to suffer for very long. However, I suggest steering clear of this one altogether."
2,Poor writing makes for a poor movie,"We watched this hoping for a good laugh & ended up with an occasional smile. There are several Oscar winners in this film. But there were also four writers. Doesn't matter how good the actors are if the material is poor, there's only so much that can be done with it. Too bad."
4,Cute movie.,"I like anything with Vince Vaughn in it. Good message, but not for younger kids. Lots of good actors that will make you laugh."
1,Did not like,Thought it would be a fun Christmas movie to watch. It turned out to be a bit raunchy from the onset for family viewing.
2,"No heart, more crude than cute","I was attracted to the star line up and the story had promise but fell very flat. This could have been a classic holiday movie unfortunately this movie has too many crude moments to be funny. Makes fun of red necks, Cougars, and aging California hippies to an extreme I found tiring. For some context to this remark, I liked Billy Bob Thorton in Bad Santa but it had more depth than Four Christmas which does not have the heart one looks for in a holiday movie whether a comedy, romance, drama or action movie. I made it through once but, I will not watch this movie again."
3,funny xmas movie,funny and enjoyable for the holidays. It was a little over the top at times but great laughter that takes away the stress of the holidays
1,Unfunny,This movie was pretty sucky. It tried to be funny but I think Vince Vaughn has overplayed this type of character.
3,Space filler.,The film was ok for filling a couple of hours on a late Saturday afternoon. Which seems to equal the time it took to write and film the script.
1,"THIS MOVIE IS A BIG ""LUMP OF COAL""!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","This movie sets a new low for bad movies. It was totally unwatchable after about 10 minutes. I was stunned by how terrible it is in acting, story line, egos, etc. I let a younger co-worker borrow it since she had not seen it yet. I hope she is still my friend after she watches it. OMG!!! It is soooo awful. Put your hard earned money in a shredder rather than buy this disc. It is toxic to the senses!"
1,4 Christmases to forget,"I agree with the 1 star reviews. There are some great stars in this movie and I love Reese Witherspoon. This had all the makings of a Christmas classic, but it is certainly missing something. There are some humorous spots, but too few and I looked forward to the end of the movie. I am donating my copy to Goodwill!"
1,A Sad Disappointment....,"Well i picked up Four Christmases and was excited to see Reese Witherspoon and Vince Vaughn together in a movie. I exspected to see a funny family comedy. Dont get me wrong, i already was prepared for some things my children shouldnt watch but people said it was a ""Great Family movie"". Well they were wrong. In the first 3 minutes there are VERY sexual references, about 3 or 4 cuss words, and Reese and Vince went into the bathroom and it shows them kissing and her wrapping her legs around him and suggests some very innapropriate behavior. Also there are very innapropriate things like a six or seven year old boy streaking, a woman talking about the ""pains of breast feeding"", and a thirty or so man having an affair with like a 60 year old woman, who often talk about what they do in bed.Trust me there are more than that but you get the picture. My kids were horrified at this movie. If were you i would steer clear of this bad apple."
1,4 Christmases,"This will NOT be a Christmas tradition at our house. It was mean and ugly. Shows only the bad aspects of the holiday and families, none of the good things. They manage to make even the actors look bad."
2,"4 Christmases but not even 4 laughs, 2 stars are for a game cast trying hard.","I really wanted to like this movie; it has a great cast; and I am a sucker for Christmas movies. Witherspoon is someone I know and like from other films; I am not a fan Vaughn but he didn't actually annoy me (at least not much). The supporting cast includes people I would watch read the phone book which, come to think of it, would probably have been more entertaining. How any group of people, let alone people as talented as the cast of this film, would decided this script was worth doing, and why any studio would finance it is beyond me. There are at least 6 dozen Christmas comedies that are better written and funnier; find one of them instead!"
2,"predictable, but still","an okay movie for Christmas-crazy viewers. Reese Witherspoon is always so lovely, and even though you know where the movie will end up, it's kinda fun to watch! For renting, not for buying."
3,OK for a Christmas comedy.,"Never have been a real big Vince Vaughn fan. Kristin Chenoweth's boobs look hot, so I guess it wasn't a total waste of time."
1,This is a terrible movie,Do not waste your time! This movie is a terrible waste of Reese Witherspoon's talent...disappointing in every way including violence.
2,Not a very good Christmas movie!!!,I did not enjoy this movie for one moment. I love Christmas movies and this one is not to add to my collection.
2,I expected more...,"with all the great actors cast in this movie I just expected more from it. The concept was good and I think they could have done a lot more with it. There were a few funny parts but not a lot, I fell asleep near the end of the movie so that tells you how interesting and captivating it was to the viewer."
3,Four Christmases,"This movie was just Ok. Was not Vince Vaughn's finest hour. He is way funnier that this.I guess staring with Reese was just too good to pass up or something. Again, just OK.Not horrible, not good."
2,triteness + tastlessness=terrible,"I think that my title says it all. This movie had real potential with an interesting concept and two bankable stars, but somehow the writers totally missed the boat. The two main characters are live-in lovers who plan to spend Christmas in Fiji, as far away from family as possible. When their flight is fogged in, they feel obligated to visit all four households in their fractured families. The households could have been amusing, but instead they are tasteless and over-the-top. Somehow projectile vomiting by a baby and wrestling matches between grown men did not seem amusing to me. My advice is to rent ""White Christmas"" or ""It's a Wonderful Life"" instead."
1,Christmas Movie,"I was so disappointed in this movie. It was very predictable and parts were plain old annoying. I would not recommend this at all. I love Reese Witherspoon, but she should have thought twice before doing this movie. I bought it is blu ray too because I assumed it would be good. I was wrong."
2,I wasn't impressed,"Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon ""who could do much better than this movie"" play an unmarried couple looking to spend their Christmas vacation on an exotic island. Things don't go as planned when their flight is canceled and they wind up visiting relatives which they wanted to avoid doing the most.I found the movie a bit un-involving and even boring at times. Vince Vaughn seems to just do movies if they are a comedy and Jon Favereau is co-starring in it with him. I don't think he even reads the scripts to his films any more. Fred Claus wasn't fantastic, yet this movie makes that look like a Christmas classic. Plus that at least had some charm and heart-warming moments. I'd honesty even watch Christmas with the Kranks again over ever viewing this again. The film has mild laughs but it lacks fun or joy even."
1,Bad movie,"This movie is not intertaining at all. Very crude and disgusting scenes add nothing to the movie. The actors involved in this movie are certainly too good for this ""let down"" movie. I was very disappointed in it."
1,"The terrible, horrible, no good very bad movie","The other one-star reviews say almost everything that needs to be said. 4C's is an absolute stinker of a film.The only thing that hasn't been mentioned by other insightful reviewers is that Vince Vaughn is not really funny at all. He's sarcastic in a rapid-fire but predictable manner. To paraphrase John Knowles' ""A Separate Peace,"" Sarcasm is the weapon of the weak."
1,"Crude, Vulgar, Gross Waste of Time !","How did some producer get Reece Witherspoon and Robert Duval to play in this gross film that insults the values of everything decent about families, relationships, kids, adults, pregnancy, .... and more and more. Nothing in the movie was funny. Just a gross waste of time and money. We quit after about 40 minutes but cannot imagine any way this film could ever redeem itself."
3,It's Funny but Definately not a must see!,I would not call this a Christmas movie. You could take away the holiday aspect and the movie would still be funny. Both Vince and Reese are true veterans. They no how to take an ok script and turn it into a decent movie. The biggest problem with the film is that it really holds back. These are the same people that created the movie Stepbrothers which was hilarious because it was so over the top. This movie seems afraid to just let everything hang out. I would definately not buy this one. Just download it off the net. It's funny but definately nothing to run over anyone to see.
1,A Major Disappointment,"I really like Reese Witherspoon and had seen a lot of positive promotion for this movie. What a major disappointment. In all honesty I would rank this film among the top 25 worst films I have ever seen. I found very little humor in it. Many of the attempted gags are ripoffs of other successful Christmas movies, including Christmas Vacation. In this film they fall flat. The adult characters all act like back woods idiots. The kids are ill mannered brats. The movie was so annoying I had to turn it off after an hour. Nobody has a perfect family, but Four Christmas paints such a cynical and negative view of families it's actually offensive to watch. I'm really surprised that Reese Witherspoon would agree to this script after her critically acclaimed performance in Walk the Line. This is a major step back for her."
2,Sophomoric Humor,"It's just my personal opinion. I am not a fan of juvenile humor and this movie is full of it. Yes, it made me laugh a few times, but I was more often mildly disgusted than anything else."
3,comedy,"liked it vaughn and witherspoon really click in this movie and the supporting cast is great, glad we bought it"
4,Cute Christmas tale!,"While I never expect much from the usual romantic holiday movies, this one I find myself watching every year. No, it is not an Oscar worthy film, but it is a cute Christmas movie that gives the audience a chance to laugh and still get to the heart of the holidays!"
3,Good stars,"Just don't know if it was as intertaining as I thot it would be with the stars that are in it! But, I watched the whole thing and laughed at the brothers fighting! Interesting to think about your own family dynamics as you watch."
4,"Stunning, stop-you-in-your-tracks music! 4 1/2 stars.","Typically stunning, captivating recording of this era for Blue Note records. The title composition is absolutely mindblowing. It swings hard and speaks softly. Want great hard bop? Here it is. I enjoy it more than The Sidewinder. All of Lee Morgan's full-length Blue Note recordings are worth acquiring."
3,THEY PROCRASTINATED,"GIVEN ALL THE TALENT ON THIS CD, I FOUND THE MUSIC HERE RATHER BLAND ! OFTEN TIME I PURCHASE MUSIC SOLEY BY THE ASSEMBLY OF ARTISTS ON A RECORDING. BEING A DEVOTE FAN OF LEE MORGAN & WAYNE SHORTER, I FELT ASSURED THAT THEY WOULD ""ROCK MY WORLD"" THAT DID NOT HAPPEN IN THIS INSTANCE !"
4,very good,very good for making sweet and sour chicken... simmmered with a little pineapple and boneless chicken and serve over pasta or rice.
1,NOT the Sweet 'n Sour sauce they advertise...,"The Sweet n Sour sauce pictured is bright red and VERY similar in looks to the Sweet n Sour sauce you get from Chinese food restaurants. I ordered a case of this stuff for $ 19 and was very disappointed in it. The sauce I received is a brownish color with bits of red and green pepper in it. It's not very sweet like you would expect (and hope) it to be. The label on the sauce I rec'd was totally different also. The one online is the 'New and Improved' label and the one I rec'd was not.My opinion is that if you're looking for the traditional restaurant style sweet n sour sauce then this is definitely not it. Now I have to figure out what to do with an entire case of this cruddy stuff. It would be one thing if the sauce was just different but I actually don't like the flavor at all. Oh well, I'll just keep looking. :)"
4,Pleasantly Surprise,"This is generally not ranked in the upper eschelon of Shorter efforts, but I was pleasantly surprised and how lovely it really is. This is very low-key shorter, and is a great recording to listen to at night. While not in the league with Speak No Evil or Adams Apple, this is not far behind and anyone who enjoys Jazz of a more restrained type will appreciate this."
4,Gets better the more you listen to it,"It's nice to see that Big Country drifted away from their ""Crossing/Steeltown/Seer"" type of sound and ended up evolving in lots of different ways. I love the classic material and those other albums are among my favorite cds. This one took me a few additional listenings to really get into. ""Fragile Thing"" and ""Perfect World"" really started to stand out to me over time (and especially after seeing the videos). Great album and excellent if you liked Big Country in the 80s and want to see how they evolved without ever really ""selling out""."
3,Bye Bye Stuart,"a 3 stars out of 5 is still a good album to listen to. Last album of Big Country, last album by the group before the charimastic but troubled singer Stuart Adamson committed suicide in a hotel room in Hawaii.... that brings an eery tone to the album, even the lyrics seems particularly depressive, but they were often depressive since 1984 Steeltown.It's not hits after hits like the 1st album The Crossing but it's a continuation of the great work of the previous years, a decent heavy country rock mellowed with some brass and acoustic guitars. A great listening in the car on a highway. So long Stuart, you should have lived again and write songs forever."
5,Great one hour view ....,It has been shown on PBS a few times .... but always worth a look ..... narration is excellent ... interviews very informative.
5,Janis Joplin - Super Hits (DVD),This item was purchased as a gift and the recipient really liked it. She said it seemed to be a quality product and really liked it!
2,"Looks great, but doesn't work well","We ordered this for doing a kitchen remodel. We figured that with it being a price pfister it would work great. However, when the faucet is on it doesn't give you a straight stream. It splatters all over the place, whether just barely on or on full power. The side sprayer works great though."
1,You get what you pay for.,"I bought this faucet because it was cheap. It has two things about it I don't like 1 is there is no low pressure. If you pull up the handle half way it will fall back down. The only water flow is on high. The other issue I have is when I move the faucet from sink to sink and back it is loosening the nut underneath and the whole faucet gets loose. I have had to tighten it back up twice and I've only had it installed for 6 weeks. I would recommend paying double for a better faucet. I didn't care much for the metal base, it seems very cheap."
5,Bento Jar,"Works like a charm. Nothing breaks a dull day like a four course lunch. Hardest part has been getting creative enough to fill the jar. Works very well, the thinner lids warped a bit with heat from hot food, but still snap on pretty tight. Insulated food jar, and soup cup work for at least six hours. Wouldn't trade this thing in for a bag for anything."
4,good product,"This product is good as to what it says. However, I feel the bowls are a little small. If it can be bigger, it will be great."
4,Envious lunch-goers eye this!,"This has turned out to be a convenient way to bring a pretty decent dinner to work without using lots of large containers that ultimately take up room in a gross staff refrigerator! I keep this on the shelf at work and for the most part the hot (or cold) components do stay the correct temperature. My main complaints are minor--if something is warm on the bottom, it will radiate heat to the top containers. Also, the largest of the 4 containers is not able to hold sauces or liquids because it is not designed to be ""watertight"" so to speak. Regardless, I use it everyday and people in the break room usually eye it."
4,Great product,Was so surprised how well this works. Easy to clean and actually helps with portion control. Really great product. Cool.
4,Bento-licious!,"Very well made, the pieces are of high quality.PROS:=====* The shoulder sling is adjustable* Very high quailty construction* Works well to keep foods cold until lunch after spending the night in the fridge.* Easy to clean despite not being dishwasher safeCONS:=====* Spork pocket inside keeps the spork rather loose and isn't well made* Rubber seal ring in soup container hard to remove, even with short nails* Directions lacking for how to (if at all) use the venter(?) on the soup containerDespite the cons, this is a well made product which I use daily to bring lunch to work. The containers are well sized to give variety and still have a small lunch to a fairly large sized lunch which will satisfy almost all but the most ferocious of appetites. I'm a 200 poundish male and this gives me more than enough food for both breakfast at work, a snack, and lunch."
2,Really Didn't Like This Product,It looked really nice but the compartments are made of plastic without insulation to keep the temperature regulated. I am not a person who uses microwaves so this product just did not work for me... If you don't mind using the microwave to reheat your food then this little item might work well for you but I really need something to hold the temperature.It is good looking however... with a very nice carry bag for people who are on the go... (sportsmen and such)
1,Not Warm And Waist of money,"It just doesn't function as it should be keeping the food warm in the winter. It just doesn't work. Maybe the warmth last two hours after pack? I don't like microwave heated food, so I decided to have one of this. But now I end up using the microwave again. :- { What a waist of money."
4,Very helpful,UPS lost this item and it hasn't arrived. LoftParty has been helpful and followed up well. Once we get the lost package.....I am confident we will be thrilled with the product....stay tuned.
1,UGLY GREY FOOD CONTAINERS,"I don't usually complain, but my monitor is color calibrated and it did not show the depressing grey color of the plastic containers. It is depressing to even think of eating food from these.I'm going to send it to my friends in IRAQ and hope they can use it!"
5,I love Mr. Bento!,I heard about this from a friend and bought it because I was intrigued. I needed something more convenient to bring a hot lunch to work to help save money. I was so pleased with this product! I would recommend this to anyone.
3,Great for taking lunches to work,"I bought this item to help me be better about taking lunches to work. It works, only comment I have is that the second bowl, the larger one with the locking lid gets some kind of suction going on and I have had to have a guy at the office open it for me...not too good for the ego but keeps the food good!!"
3,It's ok...,"After reading all of the great reviews, I bought this product (and spent 40 bucks on it). I have been doing weight watchers, and also trying to eat whole foods more, so this seemed perfect. When it arrived, it was missing a piece. i didn't know it at the time, so the first time I put soup in the bottom container it got everywhere (however, the company I got it from was very prompt in getting me a replacement). My biggest problem with it is that you aren't able to pack foods at different temperatures. For example, i packed soup in the bottom container and heated it before i left work. I had some beans and rice in the middle, and a small salad at the top, but when i got to work and opened it my salad was wilting already. it was kind of gross. I like the look and feel of it, but i really don't use it much at all."
3,Great for portion control and using leftovers for lunch,Fun product. Travels well. Appealing.Lids do not microwave well. Become malformed and won't seal again.
3,"If your looking for proper insulation, look elsewhere.","I wasn't too thrilled with this product I use it because it's compact and convenient.Pros:1. Nice Portion sizes2. Metal Spork3. Nice trendy satin steel finish on the lunchbox, I guess.Cons:1. Terrible insulation when compared to ""Thermos"" products2. The build quality of the actual bowls and lid is mediocre at best (think kids dinnerware)3. There is no carrying handle on the actual bento box so you need the carrying bag (which surprisingly has all kinds of straps and a drawstring too)"
4,Colleen,"Love it....the lids get a little hard to get off if damp.....but keeps the food very hot...steams! Love that I'm not ""nuking"" my child's food in the microwave each day."
2,"It's a wonderful product in theory, but...","If you have several meetings at different locations and lugging a laptop/briefcase and this lunch canister in it's carrying case, it's a poor choice because it's heavy and cumbersome. I wanted more variety for lunch so initially, this was a truly attractive item. Unfortunately, after a single use, I went back to my compact and light weight brown bag lunches and the canister is sitting in my kitchen gathering dust."
5,Big help in eating healthy,"I've been using this to prepare hot lunches for work. Start my rice cooker going along with my morning coffee, and by the time I'm showered and dressed it's ready for Mr. Bento. Keeps rice and soup/stew hot from about 7:30 until lunch-time. In fact, it's cooled off just enough by then that it's the perfect temperature to eat.So much better than going out for fast food or packing a cold sandwich! Much better even than one of those pre-packaged frozen meals in the microwave, since I know exactly what's in the food I make and I don't even have to wait the 3 minutes to nuke it."
2,"Seems practical, but...","I was given Mr. Bento as a gift last summer. I was so excited! I bring a lunch to work every day, and I thought Mr. Bento would be the perfect solution to packing a well-organized, balanced, and easy-to-carry lunch. You can imagine my dismay when the Mr. Bento containers leaked day after day. Anything remotely soft came out from the containers, which do not seal in a tupperware sort of way. Cute? Yes. Impress your co-workers? Yes. But practical? No."
3,not that great,"when we ordered this, we had very high expectations based on the product description. in fact, this product isn't very good. my husband takes it to work; he heats it to the hottest possible in the morning, and it's barely luke warm when he eats his lunch. it's about 4.5 to 5 hours later, so stretching the limits, but for the price, your expectations would be higher than a cheaper, crappier product.this works well for cold stuff, and as far as hot stuff, soup works the best, but that's about it.for the price, i would not buy this again."
5,Husband likes,"My husband works construction and has to eat in his car. He likes this because the food stays hot and he can bring lots of things. He often brings soup in the bottom, rice or pasta in the next one, some kind of fruit veggies or snack in the next one up, and usually a salsa or some condiment in the top. Bottom 2 stay the warmest. He loves the carry bag for convenience and has no trouble washing them out every night. Fork is cute too and he likes that it attaches."
3,"Great for any ""on the go occasion""","The container itself is stainless steel, but the inside containers are plastic - and not the good kind (recommend not to microwave the containers). The bag holds your spork & can hold a few other things such as napkins & condiments if needed. The bag has a sensible carry strap. I was a little disappointed that the lunch jar can not be used as a large thermos. It does keep your food warm or cold for several hours and I do love keeping my food separated. The portion sizes are great. Cleaning after use is easy."
4,Amazing,I love this product. I take my lunch with me to work to save money and this allows me to bring more than just a can of soup or something like that. With this I can actually bring meals. The only major downside is that you must let your food cool before you seal the jar or your food will sweat and get a little on the soggy side. Beyond that I have nothing bad to say. The stainless steel spork is hilarious and useful. I would recommend this to everyone that is looking for a better way to eat at work.
2,Highly Overrated,"First of all, don't be fooled by its appearance: This is not a Thermos. It will not keep your food warm or cold. For this reason, the instructions say to avoid using it for dairy products, and to consume food withing a few hours.Second, and perhaps most important, all of the bowls leak. Even the soup bowl, with a screw-on lid and gasket, leaks. The instructions say to always keep Mr. Bento perfectly upright. Try doing that in your car on your commute to work. It's impossible.In practice, the only thing Mr. Bento is good for arranging your food in pretty ways, so that you can post photos on Flickr. That's not very practical when your yogurt is spoiled not to mention spilled all over the inside of the container. I've since gone back to using a couple of $1 food containers, which at least don't leak. Also, when I put them in the fridge at work, my coworkers don't constantly ask me why I'm taking up valuable fridge space with a Thermos."
2,Small,It's really too small. The containers within are impractical. Yeh it's cute but now I need another lunch vessel to carry extra. And I'm not a big eater at all. Don't fall for the pics of pasta and chicken......it's marketing.
2,Not practical for on-the-go workers,"Received this as a gift from my spouse one year ago. A great idea, but not practical in any way. I am a doctor and currently use a plastic shopping bag to carry my sandwich or small tupperware to work. Not very glamorous, and hence the gift.The Lunch Jar is well constructed, but there are so many parts, and it's so heavy, that I have never even once used the thing. I don't have the time and creativity to pack a 4-course meal, room to store the non-compressible tin, a place to eat a multi-course meal, and the energy to wash the containers at the end of the day. I understand the appeal, and there is certainly a cult following, but it's really not useful for everyday use if you don't have much time or space for lunch. Sadly, I'm still using the recycled shopping bags a year later. Mr. Bento is still occupying space in the back of a cabinet."
3,good but not for kid,"This product is good, but is not designed for a 5 year old kid as the lunch box, because two of the bowls are too tight to be opened by a kid."
3,Way too big for a child or an average sized human!,"I bought this for my 8yr old to bring his lunch to school. He won't eat a sandwich and only likes hot food. I thought this would be a good option for us. We only used it once and the one time he did use it he only ate the food from 1 container. My son did say his meatballs and pasta were warm in the bottom container but,I nuked it in the micro until steaming hot!It was still hot enough for him to eat 4 1/2 hrs later. My husband said he would use it but, it's too much food for him to eat as well. Overall, not the best purchase I've made but, not the worst. If you're a big person who likes to eat a whole lot of food, this is for you. If you eat like an average person I think the Ms.Bento would be better. Hope this helps someone who wants to try this for their child or themselves."
4,Nice for a warm lunch,"I originally thought it is all make of stainless steel. Actually it is only the outer part. All the bowls are made of plastic--which is not what I had expected. Anyway, my daughter loves it because now she can eat ""warm"" lunch."
4,Very Cool Bento Box,"I have been wanting this Bento Box forever and just got it for Christmas. So far, so good. My only real complaint is that it is not dishwasher safe, but you can't get everything in one package. Thank you for a great lunch box, Zojirushi!"
4,great lunch thermos,"This lunch pack is very good if you are having a hot OR a cold lunch. If you want to have soup and also some fruit, it's less effective, since the heat from the hot container escapes to keep the rest of the containers warm. It does keep the stuff nice and warm also! Other than that, it's design is good and my daughter loves using it for her lunches."
4,Warm food to go...,This product keeps your food warm way beyond lunch time. You can fit more food than you would expect.
4,They replaced the chopsticks with a spork!,"I loved this product for years, until mine was destroyed in a fire. After life settled back to normal, I replaced it but was dismayed to discover that the tidy chopstick set with the just-right carrying case has been replaced with a stainless steel spork.Who the heck eats a bento box with a spork?!?Otherwise, it's still great."
3,Great jar but you can't mix hot and cold foods,I pack my husbands lunches in this jar.It holds a good amount of food.The bag doesn't provide any insulation.You can't pack both cold and hot foods in this.I've warmed the jar with hot water before packing hot foods and but then I can add fruit or something that should stay cold.considering the price I had hoped it would keep the soups hot in the soup container and the other food cool.
5,Still great after almost 3 years!,"I realized I bought my Mr. Bento almost three years ago and it is still working great! I though I would finally write a review for it :) All the seals are just fine, despite having microwaved the containers *numerous* times (never with the lids in the microwave, though). I have cooked pasta with red sauce in the two bottom container many, many times and it has not taken a stain either.I have found over the last few years that the Mr. Bento makes me eat healthier because it forces me to eat a variety of small servings instead of just jam-packing one tupperware container full of a single rice or pasta dish and then feeling like crap about 1:30 in the afternoon.If you get a Mr. Bento I strongly recommend searching through the Bento groups on Flickr because it is great for getting ideas for things to pack for lunch in your Bento Box."
4,Wonderful! The only thing to make it better would be glass containers!,"My children love this ""Lunch Jar"". The variety of healthy options possible for them to enjoy makes their lunchtime a little brighter. Like an earlier reviewer stated with her daughter, my children are finding their friends are enormously curious each day, anxiously waiting to see what will be found within it. As their ""doting"" mother, I am enjoying the challenge of preparing new and different meals in creative ways each morning. All in all, we have been more inspired by that necessary time of day---lunch."
5,AWESOME BENTO!,Since purchasing my Bento I have had alot of compliments when I use it at work. It carries all my meals and good also for days when I just want to carry snacks. Overall if you follow the instructions it is very useful and fun to use.
4,Worth Every Cent!!!,"I thought this product was very price @ first, but it was so pleasing to the eye. I just love the unique style. So I brought it. If you are going to warm your lunch in the microwave I found you should use platic wrap as a lining to avoid staining your bowls. (I use Glad Press and Seal... Sticky side facing the container.)"
3,Great.... for tiny Japanese people!,"I have been eyeing this product for a while now as I trust the Zojirushi brand and am big into saving money and eating healthy. Two things to consider for those of you who haven't bought it yet:(1) The tiny tupperwares are tiny. Soup was a two-slurp disappearing act. Salad was two or three bites (I couldn't even fit in that many grape tomatoes). Entrees didn't have enough space for rice and the entree itself. All in all, the meals left me very hungry, and I'm not a big guy - 5'10"" 170 lbs.(2) The overall canister is not tiny nor that light. Plus, being a long cylinder it uses up vital space, especially for someone like me who values saving space in my messenger bag as I bike commute to work. The shoulder band is a nice touch if you don't mind it.In the end, I opted to return it and pay the shipping out of pocket. I am better served bringing larger, flatter tupperwares that can be filled up with more food."
1,To Small,Maybe if I only ate the amount of food in here I would be smaller but I would need 2 of these just for my lunch.
4,Great product,"My only complaint with this product was that it came with only chopsticks. I know this is a Japanese product, but I would have thought that for US sales they might have thought to include travel utensils. Also, as others have pointed out, the instructions for this came only in Japanese. But seeing as how the only thing I really needed to know was the high end of temperature that this can take, I was okay with the lack of directions for this."
1,Disappointment,"The first time we used this, it leaked everywhere and ruined my daughter's school books. I had high hopes for it, but was very frustrated and disappointed."
1,This lunchbox is useless to me!,"I waste my money on this product since the container is way too small for me to use.And the container is pretty cheap to me. I probably just joing to through it away.For some reasons, Amazon would not allow me to post negative feedback!It seems like Amazon only allows positive feedback to be posted.I hate this product since it is so useless to me and I don't like the seller would not allow me to return.How come Amazon does not allow me to post my feedback!!!!"
2,Way Overpriced,Just take your stuff in tupperware this stuff is severly overpriced and stains easily if you put and heavy sauces. Don't Bother
5,freakin' cool,"yep, this thing is pretty neat, easy to use clean. Bought a couple for different men i the family as their new ""lunchbox"" and they are a hit. Totally good for a men's gift, especially a last minute thing or whatever."
5,I love it!,"I've only had it less than a week, but I love it! I can take hot food out and about with me, and have a hot, easy lunch.The four dishes are great - I can have soup, two scoop rice, some pickles, and some fruit, all in one container.My only complaint with this is that the spork that comes with it is totally unusable for soup, and it doesn't come with chopsticks. Of course, the description doesn't say that it DOES come with chopsticks, but one would think that a Japanese lunch box would come with them. But, no mind - my chopsticks fit very easily into the bag the lunch jar fits into.Solidly built like everything from Zojirushi, this will last for a long time.Wonderful!"
4,Great lunch box,I needed a lunch box that would keep my food hot or cold because I don't have either a fridge or microwave at work. I found the Mr. Bento and decided to give it a try. I absolutely love it. It's great to be able to keep my different courses separate. And it keeps my food at a good temperature. It's never hot like out of a microwave but it's still good enough to eat. I wish I would have found the Mr. Bento sooner :)
5,lunchbox,My 1st grade son LOVES this as his new lunchbox. It's a little on the big size but he doesn't seem to mind. It has four containers that are in the thermos and the only downside is that it fits nice and snug if you use all four. If you don't need the four you still want to put them in so the others aren't moving around. On the upside it makes for a lot more creative lunches trying to use the 4 of them!
5,Awesome...even though it leaks,"This lunch box is awesome. And that is an understatement. I make my lunch at around 7:30 or 8:00 am and when I eat it four or five hours later, my soup is still warm! The only problem with this product is that, no matter what, the soup leaks into the larger container. This isn't a huge problem though, because the other containers don't let the liquid in and the larger container doesn't leak into whatever bag you are keeping the lunchbox in...so no worries! All my friends are jealous of the awesome lunches I can have. On a regular day, I can fit an entire can of soup, part of a sandwich, a whole container of fruit and a handful of pretzels. Perfect!"
5,Unique and practical,"This is a very practical lunch box. It comes with a carrying bag, which comes in handy when you commute by bus or train.This bento box can hold a surprisingly large amount of food. The bottom container with its screw-on lid is better suited for soup. The second container is the largest and best for a main course. It has a thick insulated lid. The top two containers are great for cold food, like salads and fruits.This is more expensive than a standard lunch box but the quality and unique design of this item justify the higher price"
5,Ordered two more,This insulated lunch box set works so well that I ordered two more. Using only one means washing dishes every day - three buys me some extra slack time. This lunch jar is the best nicest lunch box I have owned.
4,Good but why not great?,"I bought this as a holiday present for myself and it's really cool. I just wonder why it couldn't be 10% cooler.The pros; it's awfully fun to pack lunch in little matching containers instead of a mishmash of stained disposable junk, it's easy to carry in its neat little black bag, the containers within the insulated part maintain their temperature well, and it's fun (so true it's worth saying twice).The cons: why does the main-dish container have to be designed so that it leaks liquid? It doesn't seem to this naive user that this was mandatory; why not use a screw-on lid as in the soup container? And why can't it be dishwasher safe? If it were not for these two problems I would give it five stars. Still worth buying, though."
4,Good for warm food,Mr. Bento is very useful for food that needs to be kept warm but I'm not so very happy about the food that needs to be kept cold. Overall its great to carry my lunch everywhere and have it stay warm.
5,Just Love It!,"I received a Mr. Bento for Christmas. I have carried it to work for three days now. Not only does it keep food warm and cool, one can carry a variety of food in a compact container. Additionally, it promotes healthy portion sizes. It's definitely a tool for healthy eating. That alone makes it worth the price - or pack your lunch for two weeks and it will pay for itself. Well made too - in fact, I just ordered the slightly more expensive 3 bowl model for someone as a gift."
3,Mr. Bento---good not great,"Mr. Bento holds a LOT of food in those four seemingly small bowls. Packed as shown in the picture, it is more than I can reasonably eat for lunch. Also, the largest container has a tendency to leak even when the lid is tightly closed. It keeps food nicely warm, though, and it is very easy to carry. It might be a good choice for someone who has a VERY big appetite, and doesn't need to pack soup."
3,"Does its job, but...","Pros:1. The advertising is 100% true - this lunchbox keeps food warm for a long timeCons:1. Tiny containers - I can't imagine anyone with a normal appetite feeling satisfied after eating the minuscule amount of food this product holds.2. Hand wash only - This especially drives me nuts when I eat messy foods that are hard to clean (esp. oatmeal!)3. Retains smell - This is my number one complaint. If you put strong smelling food into any of the containers, they will smell for a long time thereafter! It is VERY HARD to get rid of the odor, even if you follow the instructions!Do I recommend it? If you eat like a bird and don't mind nightly dish-washing, then sure. Otherwise, settle for the sandwich box."
3,falls short of expectations,"This product is not up to what I know Zojirushi could easily do - perhaps pricing was an issue.The cheap top outer lid is only matched by the uninsulated containers inside the carrier. I think if they expect consumers to pay a premium for hot lunches, a few dollars would still land them within this price range and given the consumers a much better product.Instead, I have used a lunchbot container to try to remedy the shortcomings."
1,Looks great but!...?,It is hard to put in the bag and of course take out.not really keeps food hot or cold.one of the cup was leaking.disappointment..
2,Hot Lunch! Not,"My husband is an account manager, and is trying to eat healthy--but he drives about a 1000 miles a week. Access to a microwave is not always available. SO,I bought this thinking that we could heat his food in the morning and it would be at least a little warm still at lunch. Stone cold is the report from the field. I am very disappointed."
2,Bowls are not stainless steel,"I should have read the description more carefully -- only the carry case/jar is steel. The bowls/lids are plastic. Yes, it's convenient and everything it claims to be, but if you're looking to reduce your plastic expose, this product is not for you."
3,Mr. Bento lunch jar,Works well for hot meals and soup. Not a good option if you're packing a sandwich.
1,Main Bowl Leaks,"The main bowl can't be used to store liquids because it doesn't seal completely and will leak if it's tipped over. This seems to be by design. The lid is not a press-and-seal or even screw-on, but rather you turn it 1/8th of a turn to lock it down. If you never plan on having soup as your main dish (rather than the very small soup side-dish bowl) or even extra-juicy steak in the main dish then it will probably work fine. Otherwise this is not the bento for you.I usually really like Zojirushi products, so this was a disappointment for me. I'll be returning it for a refund and looking for a different bento."
1,The Kingdom of Wundle,"This is a children's book. I made a mistake buying this book. While I do read books and stories aimed for younger readers, I found this was not my thing. I lost interest and did not finish reading the story. There are some children's books that are classics and can be enjoyed by both children and adults, this is not one of them."
1,Are you kidding?,"If you are looking for an anti-religous movie in general, and an anti-Catholic one in particualr, this is the one. It is a pro-gay treatise that is insulting in both premise and dialogue. A comedy it is not."
2,Oh dear.,This movie feels as though it was written for a high school curriculum in health and family explorations. It lacks depth and insight. Kathleen Turner is a great actor and does her best to pull along a dull and predictable storyline; but the film seems shallow. Her performances in Serial Mom and War of the Roses as well as the great The Accidental Tourist show her ability to play a complex character and intriguing mom. She continues to be a great and accomplished role model for all those in the arts. This movie is simply a misstep. It happens every now and then even to the really great ones.
1,"A ""Catholic-bashing"" film","With a script that includes lines like, ""I don't have to think, I'm Catholic!"", this film is another example of how anti-Catholicism is one of the last acceptable forms of bigotry in America. If you enjoy films that misrepresent a faith tradition while supporting the redefinition of marriage, you will enjoy this film."
5,Fun and Heartfelt,"I really loved this movie. Other reviews here give you details of the plot so I wont go into that. This movie is all about love and navigating family relationships. The director, Anne Renton, led us (the audience) on a family journey of perfect imperfection, letting us feel our bodies bubble with laughter in one moment and cry tears of loss and joy in other moments. The acting was superb with veteran actress Kathleen Turner leading the cast. It was nice to see Emily Deschanel in a different role from her Bones character. I highly recommend it to all families. In my opinion, the movie is about real life, authentic in it's representation of the struggles that we face being human and being a part of a family."
2,weak,A few laughs but I need more than a few to give a good rating. Loosely written and KT can't carry the whole thing. She misses her mark. Maybe my expectations were too much since her early movies. Watchable but not too much of a movie.
2,Poor Replacement,I bought this to replace the belt on my sears snowblower made by MTD. Original belt lasted 15 winters. This belt is not nearly the same quality and has a rubber cogged bottom as opposed to a solid fully covered bottom. This causes quick wear and does not allow for complete disengagement of the drive pulley. Recommend that if you have a Sears unit you pay a few bucks extra and get the original quality belt. It will save you time and money in the long Run.
5,"The right part for MTD, Craftsman","I had the part # so this was easy to find for my Craftsman blower. I don't think I could have found the correct one otherwise. Most fitment guides list the part as 754-0430B or 954-0430B which is a two-pack for blowers with two belts. This one is correct for blowers with one auger belt. As for the thing itself, it is an OEM part, it goes round and round as well as I expected - no complaints. Watch out for aftermarket belts - they are often the wrong size no matter what the parts book says. This was just like the old one. Yay - something was right for a change!"
1,Former Marine,"I for another must have gotten a different book than what other reviewers did.Really can't find much good to say about this book, I can understand why it was put on a shelf for X years, should have remained there."
1,Puzzled,"I'm not sure that I read the same book other reviewers read. Although the novel had moments of painful realism, it was, for the most part, a jingoistic, cliched, disorganized, and poorly written account of the Korean War. One hopes for more for the long overlooked soldiers who fought in Korea than the self-congratulatory officer worship of this novel. I can only hope that this inspires a more gifted writer to address the topic."
4,A wonderful Novel,"This was a great novel and I enjoyed reading it thoroughly. Simmons is a wonderful writer and has been given the gift to convey the pain, the power and the emotion of Bayard. I found the novel engrossing and I could barely keep it down. When I finished it, I was left hoping that Bayard could live a happy life that he had earned. I actually found myself caring about the character, which tells a lot about how well he was created. I recommend this to anyone that wants to know more about the Korean War."
3,high riser,"It doesn't work the way it should. You get what you pay for, it worked a few times coming up to the height of the other bed but then it stopped. My guests were sleeping on a mattress close to the floor. It doesn't ""pop-up"" at all!!"
2,This book is awful,"This has to be one of the worst math books on the market. While it starts off OK (with the review of vector addition and algebra), the treatment of later material is terrible. The authors provide skimpy and disorganized explanations with insanely difficult problems. Get a good teacher for this class (or a better book) or you'll be in for a rough ride."
3,"Good for reference, not so good by itself","This book was used in my vector calculus class at UCSD. I think if I was in one of my upper division engineering classes it would be great to use as a reference to help me figure out problems. However, as a math book alone, this was not too helpful. Many of the explanations lack clarity and are from a mathmatician's point of view (in other words, very difficult for lower division students who are not math majors to understand). Also, a lot of the problems are practically impossible. The only reason I did alright in this class was because I had a great teacher. I would recommend this book for people who are in science or engineering classes and need a superficial introduction to vector calculus, but NOT for math classes that go into deep analysis of vectors."
2,Could be Worse,"Even though the latest editions have been dumbed down considerably by Snider, what remains of Harry F. Davis are still far better than the similar book by Marsden and Tromba.For example the introduction uses the word roughly, which is an important qualification. When i read parts of Gibbs original book (available free on-line), Elements of Vector Analysis, i see that he left some wiggle room in his definition. I don't think this was unintentional. For it makes Gibb's text quite adequate even for today's scientists and engineers. Gibbs probably anticipated others working on a more exact definition than his work provided (though not by Procustean means and methods as is common today).Anyway on page 1, here's Davis-Snyder defition:""Roughly speaking a vector is a quantity that has direction as well as magnitude."""
3,vector analysis,"the most important fact is that the previous edition is identical. they've just reaarranged some topics. so if you have to buy the book get the 6th edition and save some money. (can't speak for earlier editions).other than the last chapters of stewart's calculus text, and the popular text by Marsden, this is the only vector calculus i've read so i don't have much to compare it to. it has pretty good sections on tensors which is why they use the book here at new mexico tech. the problems are doable but can take some time. there are answers to many of the problems but not all the odd ones.it's not an easy read but i think it reads better than Marsden. everytime i turned to Marsden for help, i found it more inscrutable.when i retire i'll make a comparison. until then, you're probably stuck with whatever your instructor sticks you with. and as with all texts, there's probably something better tailored for your particular brain in the library."
3,"This is a good replacement for ""Micro Cornucopia"". But, has runs out of steam once read",There once was a periodical called Micro Cornucopia that read just like this book. The value behind this book is beyond programming. It includes some very basic entry-level information on the hardware implications. I think it is a good book for helping someone transition to embedded systems from the dream world. OOPS I meant application programming where there is no need to understand the underlying hardawre.
4,excellent for anyone doing embedded systems programming,"Although (in computer years) a bit old, this book is filled with timeless information, hints, and code for those doing embedded systems programming, new or experienced."
3,Not What They Seem,These erring look better online than in person. I hardly use them at all. They look rather cheap in person and stone is smaller than it looks online. Not sparkly at all. Disappointing!
2,Personal ad experiences?,"Liam seeks sexual encounters through responses he receives from personal ads placed in many different papers and magazines. He takes on the persona of many identities as he meets up with like minded individuals. Liam comes across in a cold and calculating manner, indifferent to the feelings of other that he meets, uses and discards along the way. His one night stands are unfulfilling and it is never clear just what he really wants. At times it appears that perhaps sudden death at the hands of one of the respondents to his ads would be a fitting end. I suppose we all have at one time or another met up with individuals who are nothing more than users."
3,Scathing and sexy,"Hartnett's tale of one gay man's adventures in the personal ads is quite dark and without catharsis. But it certainly is fun! Liam is getting over his lover's death and begins entertaining himself with answering personal ads. This progresses to placing elaborate personal ads just to see whom he'll attract. Through the hot sex and the wild stalker, Liam finds out a lot about himself as well as the nature of those answering personal ads. Hartnett has a great commentary on gay culture (the story is set in London, but it's pertinent to America as well). It's definitely a typically British story, so it might be difficult for some American audiences looking for fluffy, bright gay stories, but it's quite worth reading if for nothing else but the wonderfully sexy trysts."
1,Don't buy this one,The pegs fall right through the holes. Useless for the intended purpose of hammering pegs. I'll keep looking for the old model like I enjoyed as a kid. This thing is headed for the trash can.
5,A Fabulous Read,"After reading The Mammy, I could not wait to read the Chisellers. I was not disappointed in the least, I couldnt put this book down at all! Its already been passed on to my sister, a very addictive read. Brendan O'Carroll makes all the characters come to life so that you feel as if you know each of them personally and that I had been transported to 1960's Dublin. I cannot wait to get a copy of the Granny!"
4,"""AH, A FINE READ, INDEED!","Agnes Browne and her brood of seven continue their roguish adventures in this next installemnt of Brendan O'Carroll's marvelous trilogy. Though humorous again, this book takes a harsher look at the realities of this family, centering on character studies of the children. The good, the bad, and the tragic. I enjoyed this change very much. Made for page turning reading and deeper insight. A most marvelous read that keeps you smiling sometimes even through tears. The Browne's are to be cherished forever!!!"
1,Disappointing at Best,"After so thoroughly enjoying The Mammy, I looked forward with great anticipation to the arrival of The Chisellers. I found it a pale sequel to its predecessor. Predictable and plodding, it lacks the robust characterization that brought The Mammy to life. Do read the first novel; avoid disappointment and leave the second on the bookstore shelf."
3,acrylic risers smaller than expected,"I was not aware how small they were, so it was kind of a surprise, but for the price I can still use them but not for what I had intended. The quality is good."
5,vol 5 of collectors/limited series,"Just got this out of the cellophane! Two days is amazingly quick service. This does have the collectable toys in it. This time it is Togusa, completing the Laughing Man logo base with Batou and Motoko. There is also a black Tachikoma. It is two disks. Two more releases and this series will be complete!"
3,a decent read,"This book by Gish Jen was not what I expected. Really, I don't know what I expected. It covers the feelings of Chinese immigrants and second generation who have to deal with their Chinese background and American ways. It did not speak for me as it did to some of the others who read the book. Don't know why, but it seemed kind of disjointed in places.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
3,difficult to follow the story,"While I am impressed with how the characters are portrayed, especially the more modern Chinese, I find it difficult to read the book, because of the fragmented flow caused by different character's narration. Also no quotation marks around who said what. It makes my eye tired, and my speed of reading slowed down. So I give it a 3 star, because I think with a better way of telling the story, it will make the story easier to understand and may get more audience."
3,HARD TO FOLLOW,"It's not a bad story or book. It is in quite a few places hard to follow. It's written in a narrative, almost like a play. In many areas it's hard to figure out who is talking and who is responding. No need to go over the plot, others here have. So it's 3 to 3 1/2 stars."
2,Stinker,"I hate to be negative, but this book was truly a waste of money. The activities are not useful to actual business executives learning English- entire units on ""calling and making a hotel reservation"", ""talking to people at a trade show"", etc. They have even laid out the book where you can't even use it without the classroom CD for the majority of the exercises. I didn't know this when I purchased the book, and the CD, of course, costs more than the book! I have never encountered a good Business ESL text. I think I need to produce one myself!"
1,I Didn't buy this But,The Packs in the image other then that Upper Deck are all worth between 15 to 20 cents each and the Upper Deck pack maybe 50 cents and I would point out if the 25 packs you get are indeed what they show in that Image then it is highly unlikely going to be worth the $25 Dollars you would have to pay.
3,Lost & Found,"It wasn't entirely shocking to discover that Ian Van Dahl's follow-up to their 2002 debut 'A.C.E.' was basically re-write after re-write of their chart-smashing trance-meets-Eurodance formula. Why mess with success, as is the case with most mainstream artists these days. So for as catchy as the lead singles from 'Lost & Found'- ""I Can't Let You Go"" and ""Where Are You Now""- may be, it's rather disappointing that Ian Van Dahl didn't try even the slightest to juice things up. Nothing on 'Lost & Found' is remotely memorable as previous hits ""Castles in The Sky"", ""Will I?"" or ""Secret Love"". The only time they actually deviate from the formula is ""Inspiration"", and consequently it's one of the disc's stronger tracks. Aside from the aforementioned tunes, ""Do You Feel the Same"" manages to truly stick out. As for the rest, all that remains are the continuing barrage of overblown trance grooves and hooks that just aren't solid enough."
3,pretty good,"My experience with vocal trance is much like the previous reviewer's. My problem is: I tend to compare everything to DJ Encore & Engelina's ""Intuition"" (best vocal trance I've ever heard). So I was never impressed by Ian Van Dahl. The music was never as interesting or strong as DJ Encore. But since it looks they won't put out another disc this century I decided to try ""Lost & Found"". It's not a bad disc but only one song really stands out for me: ""Inspiration"". What a unique tune! It made me listen to the rest of the disc and it's growing on me..."
2,One Very Long Song,"Let's start this with my confession that while I have wideranging musical interests I have little knowledge of trance music.If this CD is any indication, I now understand why.With the exception of no more than three songs, the same disco beat and song structure permeates, no, infects this CD. Were it not for the quiet parts between the tracks I would have little ability to tell one ""song"" from another. Perhaps this is the desired effect. If so, I'd just download one song from the CD and then replicate it 16 times and you'd have the same result as buying the CD.So why even two stars? Well the vocalist has a pretty good voice even if the lyrics are incredibly banal and if she is the woman on the CD she is good looking. How shallow is that?After I download a couple of songs to add to my running tunes on my Nano I will have a very lightly used copy of this CD for sale cheap."
2,What happened?,"First I have to say I am a big fan of Trance, Electronica, Ambient, etc. and Ian Van Dahl certainly meets my listening criteria. I bought the ""Ace"" CD after buying the ""Castles In The Sky"" remix single CD. Althought certainly not my favorite album of all time, I thought ""Ace"" was a worthy effort for a breakout artist and looked forward to the next as being a more mature and developed sound. What happened? After listening to the album a few times, I feel this artist took a step back. It could have been so much better. I hoped for more variety from her sexy-smooth voice, but 90% of the tracks sound the same. I hoped for more. I can't recommend something I won't listen to again. If you love trance like I do - check out the latest from DJ Tiesto, DJ Armin Van Burien, BT, Sasha and ATB."
2,Better singer,A few of the songs are good but rest of them is horrible. The only song I really like is can't let you go. This singer is better and have a stronger voice but still the sound and music is almost as Lasgo.
2,Ian Van Dahl did what?,"I don't know it sounds like Lasgo or Milk Inc. Annemie Coenen not Annette Coenen. Annette Gatejen is my mom's name. Ian Van Dahl or Lasgo? Peter Luts is the producer of Lasgo, Avril Lavigne, Lostpropets, Yellowcard, New Found Glory, or Chronic Feature? So Buzz Band starts at 10:00 P.M., is for brand-spankin' new music at Kwod 106.5. 107.9 The End brings DJ Sammy. DJ Encore & IIO looks great!"
4,Up There With The Best,"Ian Van Dahl's Lost and Found is up there with the best vocal trance cds. The female vocalist dominates this cd and if you liked the previous album called ""ACE"" you will also love this one which has good beats, synths and tempo. Things start out great with ""Can't Let You Go"" which is about love longing, then things move onto a nice ""Inspiration"" which is a bit cheesy, then followed by a strange song called ""Crying"". My favorite track in the whole album is called ""My Own"" is slower paced than the other tracks but has that romantic overtone to the lyrics and mood of the music. Overall the songs have sad lyrics but upbeat tempo which conflicts to the positive mood in trance genre. But if you keep in mind that not all trance songs are about love, and positive energy there is the other side and it is shown here. I had a great time listening to this cd and I think you will as well!"
5,The Most Incredible Euro/Trance Album Today!!!,"There is just no way of rating this one because in my opinion, this is the most awesome trance album today. I'm not sure from where you will be reading this from, but for us Euro/Trance deprived midwesterners, this is a great way to escape the music scene of today and enter the great sounds of european (beligian) dance music!! Every song from this album is unique in its own way, but never loses its pace. If you want strong bass beats, ""I can't let you go"", ""Crying"", ""My Own"", ""Walking Away"", and ""State of Mind"" is for you. If you want more of the laid back euro/trance, ""Inspiration"", ""Where are you now"", ""Do you feel the same"", ""Come To Me"", ""Without You"" is for you. I know I didn't name all of them and that's because they lie somewhere between the rest listed. I strongly recommend this to anyone who is into euro/trance, it is worth every penny!!!"
3,Described as new,"When I purchased this script, it was listed as new. Unfortunately, upon receiving it, I discovered that the pages were aged (somewhat yellowed) and their were markings in the script. Quite obviously, this was not the ""new"" script that I thought I had ordered."
3,Very Good,"The book arrived on time and it was a very good read...would like to find more books on this author,"
5,Excellent Step tape,I've been looking all over for this tape in stores for the past three years.. It's that good. I highly recommend this tape if you want a great work out and enjoy step. For a intense workout do all three sections at once.
5,long enough to make a difference,"I received my copy of this video from Kathy Kaehler herself, whom I interviewed for a newspaper article years ago. (She was very nice, by the way.) Although I've since tried numerous other exercise videos, hers is absolutely the most effective for me. All the others are just too short. (The Reebok Advanced Step tape is laughably short compared to this one.) After having two babies in two years, I just started working out again, and this is the only tape that produces results - and you don't have to wait forever to start seeing improvements! :)"
2,"good beginner workout, but very dull","This workout is good for beginners, altthough Kathy does not stress form or even begin the workout with a good warm-up. However, I did enjoy the intermediate and advanced stepping sections and the stretch at the end. END"
4,Great video for those with limited space!,"I have a small apartment and little room to do areobics. This is a great video because all the moves are isolated to the step with little movement away from the step. Not to mention I love the fact the Jamie, Justine, and Julianne seem to struggle along with me. There's nothing worse then when you're dying trying to get through a workout and everyone on the video seems to make it look easy! UGH!"
1,Poor Performance,"I found definite problems with amplifying channel 61 and it generally made the signal worse. I bought this unit to boost the signals going into a 5 way splitter. There was no noticeable improvement to any channel. I did not spend the time to determine if it improved the VHF channels since these channels have a clean signal. In the end, I decided to remove the unit from the circuit.At this point I would not buy this unit or recommend it to anyone. I think either my unit is bad or the manufacture is not meeting their advertised performance of 36db gain for the full bandwidth from VHF to UHF. I contacted the supplier on 02/04/09 and requested another unit to test. I have not heard from them yet..."
2,Poor UHF performance,"This is supposed to amplify signals from 40 Mhz to 900 Mhz (below channel 2 to above the highest UHF channel). If that were true, it would be good for boosting an antenna signal enough to compensate for the loss you get when splitting the signal to several TVs. It works well for all VHF channels. It does not boost the low UHF channels very much, and it makes channels above 30 noisy. It attenuates the mid to high UHF channels (has negative gain). The higher the channel numbers, the weaker the signal gets. Without this amplifier, channel 58 had a noisy picture. With the amplifier channel 58 was not even visible."
1,Sounded like a good idea--natural colored--but tastes like dust,"I grow stevia plants and crumble the leaves into my drinks. I thought this natural greenish-colored powder would have the same taste. Unfortunately, it tastes like dust, not pure stevia. I prefer Stevita liquid stevia, unflavored. This powder was a big disappointment. My daughter felt the same way, and it was she who passed the Planetary Formulas stevia on to me."
1,YUCK!,"Okay so I bought stevia before and it was in the white powder form and tasted pretty good. So I ordered this. First I was thrown off by its ""au natural green color"" but I figured hey it is good for me. Well this product is the definition of ""Bad after taste""... It simply made everything I added it to taste terrible. I have thrown away alot of ice tea and coffee I flavored with this; than I just threw this way....everything is better now....yuckkkkkk.!!!"
2,No magic this time,I am sorry to say that this production of a follow up to a wonderful piece of cinema does not even come close to Sting 1.
1,Sting II not worth it,This is not anything like the original Sting. I thought it would be a worthy follow up but it was just strained. I would not recommend it.
3,"Great at first, then got slow","Overall, this book was OK. I became interested in the characters right away; the beginning caught me. I was expecting more passion than it presented, but I thought it would be toward the end. As I kept reading, I felt more and more like skipping pages to get to the parts I wanted to read. That's how much the story started lagging. There are also parts that, to me, seem a bit unbelievable. This book is seperated into 3 parts. I thought this would mean that this would be some sort of epic story that spanned a significant period of time. Instead, it seems the storyline lasted for about 2-3 weeks. There were so many different story lines packed into such a short timeline that I just felt there wasn't enough devotion to any specific part, making the whole book very weak reading."
2,Weak adventure story,"The Maker of Universes by Philip Jose Farmer is a banal wish fulfillment fantasy: a 66-year old guy living in mid-century America with a fat nagging wife is suddenly transported to a magical world where his body returns to its condition circa age 25 and he gets to have sex with beautiful women and fight barbarians and monsters. It is somewhat similar to Farmer's first Riverworld book, To Your Scattered Bodies Go, but it lacks the interesting setting and characters that make Riverworld a classic.For ""guy goes to another world and fights monsters and barbarians"" action try Edgar Rice Burroughs (the Barsoom or Pellucidar series, for example), or Michael Moorcock (any of the Eternal Champion books)."
1,I gave up on it after 100 pages...,"This is one of the few books that I have outright abandoned. After about 100 pages, I was frustrated with the complete lack of character development and breakneck pace of the book. The concept upon which the book is based (multiple parallel worlds that are worlds stacked on top of each other) isn't that great to begin with, and the author does absolutely nothing to make it seem interesting.I had purchased the first five books of this series in hardback from the Science Fiction bookclub, thus I was motivated to finish the books and not just donate the books unread to charity. However, after reading some of the other negative reviews on Amazon, I can tell that my initial impressions with the book were spot on and that it is only going to get worse. I will spare you the specifics, but please see the reviews from jackaroe or webtarkeena - they pretty much sum it up."
5,A Super Fantasy Series,"Farmer's five-book ""World of Tiers"" series is a classic. What an imagination Farmer has! I loved the village that slowly floats fifty-feet above the ground. It's held up by air bags. The ""World of Tiers"" series and the ""River World"" series are wonderful. Don't miss them."
2,But earlier you said . . . !,"This series has some great ideas and images, but the author's flagrant disregard for internal consistency ruins it. I desperately wanted to be sucked into a psychedelic universe of wedding cake-shaped planets, green skies, carnivorous flesh plains, American Indian centaurs, cat-eyed women and jealous immortals, but the copious stupid mistakes attacked my immersion relentlessly. Examples: second cousin suddenly becomes brother; a character is killed in a highly dramatic way and is later killed again in another highly dramatic way; Wolf makes peace with the queen of the harpies and asks for her help, and suddenly, this never happened.Jose Farmer had a legendary imagination, but he was overconfident when he wrote this series. Apparently, he felt that he didn't even have to review what he wrote. Why didn't the editors catch any of this stuff?"
5,A Much Needed Book !!,"Thank you so much Niki for writing this much needed Scripturally based book. It is full of wonderful prayers for all occassions, delightful stories and pictures, and wonderful thoughts. There's no other book like it! As people read they will get blessed and comforted and they will be sending out prayers for all the precious animals of the world. God Bless You Niki for such a wonderful work!"
5,The Prayers In This Book Are Wonderful,"My prescription: provide good food and exercise, see your veterinarian for yearly exams, and use the prayers in this wonderful book."
4,Flexible resource,I have used the OPD series for several years and find the books to be easy to use and flexible for conducting my ESL classes.
1,A rip off!!!,"I am totally dissapointed with this CD it says ""Canta Como"" that means ""sing like"" but the CD does not shows the lyrics in the screen. Aarrrrggghhhh!! I cant return all the CDS I bought (15) Its not even worth it! dont buy any of these ever!!!"
5,I love the gentle scent and effortless use,"I bought a bottle of these probably five years ago. I place them in my bagged and baggless vacuum cleaners. I love how the scent is always there when I vacuum without any extra effort. It adds a small incentive to the chore of vacuuming.The scent doesn't linger long, so it's mostly a reward for the person doing the vacuuming, which is perfect for me. I don't want the scent around long after I've cleaned.I bought Beach Days last time. I'm going try a different scent this time.I was surprised how long the beads lasted. I use probably 10-15 beads per application, and the beads last until the bag or container needs replacing.I don't vacuum often, but I found the beads lasted quite a long time, the whole bottle lasting several years.For me, the effortless scent is my favorite feature. I highly recommend."
2,Not Impressed.,"The only reason that I bought this product was because I love the laundry softener and the dish detergent. This product really disappointed me because you can barely smell the scent. I followed the directions and then when that didn't create a scent, I literally vacuumed the beads up with the vacuum. That worked a little bit, but I would NOT recommend waisting your money. Go for the sheet spray and spritz a bit on your carpets after your vacuum and that works much better!"
3,Lavender Vacuum Beads,Not really what I expected. I have a bagless vacuum and the beads do not put much fragrance in the air.
4,Fairly Tough Ball,I bought this ball for my beagle who loves to chew and destroy his toys. I have since had this ball for almost a month and it is still somewhat intact. The large size of the ball was a great deterrent for him because he couldn't get a good grip on it to destroy it. After some incessant chewing he was able to take off a few pieces and now the ball is half its original size. But I am happy because I know that the company guarantees their toys so I can exchange it for a new one. I am also happy that the ball lasted longer than 10 minutes.
3,Not For All Day Use,So my 2 year old pit bull tore a couple of small pieces off in the first couple hours and then it's held study. I would say it's still better than most toys out there and the company will actually replace it at least once. I'm going to get a replacement and just use this one for fetching. Would highly recommend the Tux from the same company or the Kong Extreme if you want something that will really last.....I would still recommend it because it has still held up pretty well.
3,Not as tough as the Tux,We have gotten many of the West Paw toys for our 2 American Pit Bull Terriers. I like that they are made in the US and returnable if your dog destroys them. This toy didn't last very. Rocco really loved chewing on the edges of it and was able to bite off some big chunks. I will be exchanging it for another Tux. We have had the Tux for several months and it's really held up to my extreme chewer!
1,Lasted about 10 minutes,"It arrived in the mail, I gave it to my lab, he took it apart in 10 minutes. I ignored the only post on this site warning me this would happen, so here's another point of view for ya.I bought it only because it is marketed as ""guaranteed to last."" This may be a fine product for many - hey, it's 100% recyclable - just try to accurately determine how destructible you dog is before purchasing (mine eats all Kong products).Sure I could get a refund, but I'd have to mail it back to Montana... the whole thing wasn't worth it for me."
3,pretty good toy,"if you have a really tough chewer i would look for something different, although this one lasted longer than our other west paw design toys. the edges can be chewed off"
1,Little over priced?,I suggest that this be resubmitted - can't believe someone would actually buy it for the listed price. Will keep looking.
4,3:The Dale Earnhardt Story(The Book),"Good Book, Short reading, Pictorial. Of the greatest Nascar Driver Ever, and I am not a Huge Nascar fan, especially Since Dale Sr. Passing, I do like Dale Jr. and some others, But I don't follow it,**I am A Chevy Guy**. I am more of a Road Racing And Drag Racing Fan, Nonetheless, I haven't seen the movie yet as of this writing but a preview, But I do have this book and Feel it's great for any Racing Fans Or Dale Fans, Sad He's no longer with Us."
4,Bueno Pero Podria Ser Mejor,"El disco empieza con su mejor cancion ""Anoche Valio La Pena"" pero el resto del disco no mantuvo su ""momentum"". Dos razones que no le doy a este disco cinco estrellas: el tema ""El Cielo Lloro"" no beficia el disco, y la intencion de Eddie Santiago y Omar Alfano de traer el sonido de los 80 fallo gravemente con el sonido del saxofono al estilo ""Oro Solido"""
5,Gripping down to earth story,"This book had me enthralled from the beginning with allusions to an upcoming mystery. While that suspense builds up the character development is simply amazing. Characters are believable and very real. A great read. If you like the suspense in this book, you may also like Dogs of Babel, which is weaker than this book, but had the same type of mystery."
5,mackin!,"this is the finest hip-hop track ever. starts w/ sampled ""throwin' up the W"" and scratchin' squiggles, then settles into a deeeep funk groove that won't quit. Dub-C lets it rip first, but it's Mack 10 who steals it. his best line: ""Now you can cross out the bustas and snitches/Shee, only killers, hootchie b*tches and hot hydraulic switches allowed/On the turf where the real hogs dwell."" ice cube checks in w/ killer spittin', starting with: ""now i got to show you how the west coast rocks/no razor blades in my mouth - just a glock."" i listen to this over and over in my car. the bass line alone will fell buildings. you won't be sorry - unless you give this a pass."
1,Ridiculous,"After reading the first of this series, I thought perhaps the author would offer a little more this time around. This was worse than the first! The writing style lightened slightly, but I would not go so far as to call this fun, or even entertaining. It was innane, while managing to make ridiculous and overdramatic references to art and art history to try to fit into the Da Vinci Code school of popularity. Didn't finish, but read about half, and only because I was stuck in bed with the flu and out of good reads."
4,Sturdy & easy to use,"I purchased this for my mother who is handicapped. It is easy for her to use opposed to other paper towel holders, you just slip the roll on. It looks nice too!"
2,"Nice looking, poorly built","Received in a timely manner. Within a few months, the threaded top of the towel holder doesn't thread into the rod that holds the paper towel. It just sort of rests atop the roll now and falls out with a big ""CLANG"" every so often. So we're not all that impressed with the quality."
3,installed in a Toyota truck,"intal this accessory in a toyota truck throttle body, I really thought I would get a better performance in the initial acceleration but I got was a good top speed greatly improved my toyota shift is too heavy and wanted to improve their torn."
3,Something doesn't make sense,"I love this product, and as mentioned on the product's page, can be used WET or DRY. Well, the batteries died so I changed them. Didn't work, so I tried a different brand, still doesn't work. I'm going to attempt to contact Pretika and see if they can do anything or if this was misrepresented somehow. This is why I rated it 3."
1,out of any expectations,Buddy recorded much better things than this list. We cannot even recgnize Rich among these songs. Far Far away from his best works.
3,As much about cookie jars as cookies,"With 80 cookie recipes, Steffi Berne presents a pleasant little cookbook. So why then only 3 stars? This is the type of cookbook that will please about half its viewers while leaving the rest disappointed.The vast majority of the cookie recipes presented here are very complex and would be quite challenging for the novice baker. A great many of the cookies are described as `no too sweet' and use ingredients such as bittersweet chocolate more suited for adult tastes than little taste buds.On the other hand, since most of the cookies are complex advanced bakers might want to give this a look, as well as people who like not too sweet cookies.Also, the cookie jar collection of the author is features prominently, along with collector resources in the back. So, if cookie jars are one of your interests, then you should be delighted.Still I recommend caution before rushing out and purchasing this one."
4,Not that hot,Because I work outside and I keep the container in my truck - which can be very cold in the winter - the food don't stay hot for a long time. I usually pack my food - hot - around 6.30 am and by 12.00 noon the food is cold. It did not work out too good for me but I may be asking too much.
5,My son loves his hot lunches!,"I was looking for a thermos for my son to take to school, and I happened upon these lunch jars. I thought he would be able to take a hot meal once a week for fun, and I bought it on a whim. Suffice to say, he hasn't had a cold lunch since. He loves that he can choose different things to pack, it is a great way to feed him healthy food at school (not the horrible lunches they provide), and a great extra bonus is that I rarely have leftovers in my fridge anymore (he always wants to bring them to school). I have read reviews where people have said that the food was cold, but he has even complained that it was too warm at times (he had to wait for it too cool down), but he also loves that the top compartment 'stays cool', so we can put fresh fruit or a snack there.All in all, best purchase ever. I have recommended it to all of my friends with kids."
3,Well made but too little insulation.,"Nice design, with plenty of room in each container for food. I was hoping for more thermal protection. It does not keep food warm for very long. Very little insulation. But it is well made."
2,good idea but item is huge compare to how it looks online,I liked this idea but item is huge in real life. You can put food for a whole family. Is like going around with a gallon of food. As soon as I saw it was a nono.
1,Not what I expected in quality or insualtion properties,I ordered the Zojirushi lunch jar expecting something similar to a thermos -- keeps hot foods hot and cold foods cold. What a complete disappointment and waste of money!. The interior is lined with plastic and the lid is uninsulated and not water-tight -- it just clips to the body. If you want to talk about an accident waiting to happen; you've found it here. And you can apply this same review to Mr. Bento. I just printed the return shipping label and am sending this back ASAP. I recommend the Nissan JLN1400X Lunch Tote instead (even if you can't buy it here).
5,Shrimp on the Barbie,Was in great condition. Was in new box didn't look like it had ever been used. Love the movie its a great comedy.
5,Spanish/English,Cover and description on back of DVD is in spanish. However when you put it in the first screen prompt asks you to chose between English and Spanish. I chose English and the movie started in English. I was a little confused with the same movie with the English cover for a much higher price. Even though this one is in Spanish it plays English fine. Hope this eliminates some confusion.
4,Classic Cheech Marin comedy,"I Remember this movie on HBO when I was a kid, funnier now that a get some of the racial and adult humor. The DVD is in English but has the dvd cover is in Spanish. DVD also contains Spanish subtitles. Official quality, and is not a bootleg. Priced significantly cheaper then the DVD with English titled cover."
5,great game for my grandsons,Most fantastic game that you can purchase for young boysSUMMARY - JUST GREAT!
5,Great Puppet!,"I was looking to buy two lamb puppets and I not only found both at the same place, but at a fantastic price."
1,Crooks- selling expired products,"This product was old- not used, but old. Usually this product (which I have bought for many years from a different seller), has a wonderful jasmine smell as it is jasmine oil. This product that i received had barely any- a typical sign that it was way past its expiration date. Feel extremely cheated and disappointed- can not trust this seller at all- SELLING WASTED/EXPIRED PRODUCTS! What a crook/s!"
3,Watch out for its size.,I didn't read the description carefully and mistakenly thought that the Ms. Bento was just a Mr. Bento in a different color. The Ms. is considerably smaller and costs the same as the Mr. So just a heads up.
5,great deal,"Got these batteries for a fraction of what I had paid before for same battery. They charged fast and hold their charge, even on shelf they hold their charge after even not being used for over two months and when put in camera show full charge still and they last a really long time in camera, I have gone two weeks with the same battery using the camera for many pictures."
5,Saved the life of a 22 year old cat I think....,"This product was recommended to me by my vet. My VERY elderly cat experienced a urinary tract shutdown a little over a year ago and recovered. The vet says this is a phosporus binder that helps to prevent stress on the urinary tract system of cats. I don't know exactly how it works, but the cats appetite, bladder and kidney problems have not reoccurred since I have been mixing this in to his wet food daily. Probably saved his life and definitley improved the quality of his life. At 22 he's perfectly healthy at this point. Can't argue with effectiveness."
1,Broke after third use,"Like the above reviewer, the tip broke after the third use. Unfortunately, I have not had much luck finding another 23/32 inch bit with a 1/4 inch shank."
2,overpriced and simplistic,"For the price of this book there should be no mistakes. There was constant grammatical errors, and there were multiple errors where the author made a statement and then contradicted it later, sometimes this would happen multiple times concerning the same statement. The book is a very simple look at International law more for the highschool level. The author left out many important subjects and treaties like Kyoto. For the money this poorly written book was a complete dissappointment."
1,Biased Beyond Belief,"This book is not helpful in learning anything about international law. I used it for a class on the subject at the University of Wisconsin and it was really lousy. The class based everything on the book which meant hours of reading, re-reading, and re-re-reading this thing because it is so incoherent. It is also completely biased. Everything Israel does is praised. Everything goes back to WWII. Everything is Islam's fault. It kind of seemed like there was an agenda. Maybe it's not the book. Maybe it's the topic in general, but this was a huge HUGE waste of money. Don't buy this book. Don't take a class that requires this book. Just watch BBC news or read it online. It's free and it makes sense."
4,Disappointed Victory,"First the account is well-written. The structure of the book is first rate. Should you be looking for a good account of the Battle of New Orleans this is it. My criticism of the work is that Englishman Tim continued to belittle America and Americans through the work. In his opinion the British invasion force was first a first rate, tried and true army of professionals. The Americans are an ad hoc rabble of pirates, militia and bumblers. The fact that the British ""eceheloned"" their way up to a prepared position and got the @#$% shot out of their attack twice might have been mentioned. TIM, YOU lost...get over it."
5,Green's Blues,Benny Green is an amazing pianist. His time is perfect and his technique is superb. He swings harder than any pianist today. Dig his dynamics.
2,Showmanship. Zzzz.,"Hailed as the next coming of Oscar Peterson (as if that were an honor)(with whom he recorded a duet album), Benny Green is a technically gifted pianist who (like Oscar P) cannot seem to resist showing off and ""entertaining"". Although known for his blues and gospel/Horace Silver/Hamp Hawes influence, I think the Peterson disease is stronger."
4,Exactly what I needed.,"I've been looking for a tie rack for years. This one holds 24 ties and a number of belts. On the plus side, it's nicely finished and takes up little space in the closet. On the minus, I'd like it to hold ties on both sides rather than belts. I give it 4 stars because it's a little pricey. It arrived in perfect condition."
5,Love this mix!,I lost this CD again! Now I'm on the hunt to find another copy. The funny part is that I bought this CD the first time in 2000 and the second time 2 years ago and now almost the same date 2yrs later I'm looking for it again...
5,knock out dynamics!,"behold! this SACD will knock your socks off with its dynamics.if you like a good performance and a decent sound, this is the one. top recommendation!"
3,Not for your average CD player.,"Today I learned that SACD means that the CD cannot be used in the CD drive of my computer at the office, which is where I had hoped to listen to this wonderful music. Nor will it play in my CD-clock/radio so I won't be waking up to the music either. Oh well, maybe I can sell it on e-bay...live and learn."
1,The more I read the more I knew I disliked this book!!!,This book is a very quick read but it isn't worth it.Total waste of time. Too many loose ends in this book.OY!You've been warned!!!
4,Enjoyable Read,This is the first book by this author that I read. I have to say that I would read her again if another book caught my interest.This is a wonderful love story narrated by an older Hannah. She is telling us about a summer when she met her first love in a small town in Maine . It just so happens this is also a ghost story. Where we travel back in time to the 1800s and meet the Haskell's. The two stories mingle together because it ends up that Hannah is trying to learn more about Haskell's and the only known murder in the small town. I do have to say that I did feel like I missed something or more could have been told.I have to say in my opinion the story got off to a slow start. If you stick with it you will find a charming story about lost loves. Overall I do recommend this book and it is a quick read.
4,Modern gothic that has appeal to all ages,"Gutcheon weaves a tale comprised of stories from two different centuries, which switch back and forth seamlessly. The pressures of the town and family on each of the characters in the two love stories were unique and yet raised similar themes. The ghost in the story haunts both the characters and the reader, compelling me to stay up at night trying to finish this story for some resolution.This is an excellent read for both teenagers experiencing a first romance and for adults, especially those who enjoy historical fiction."
4,More Than You Know;...One persons veiw point.,"I read the book More Than You Know. It was an enjoyable book to read. If you like love stories with a little mystery and ghost tied into it, I would suggest you pick this book up and read it! This Author did a great job on this book. The way she wrote it made me never want to quit reading it. I would get to the end of a chapter and it would leave off with something really interesting, and to find out what was going to happen you had to read a whole chapter and then get to where you left off. It's like Beth is telling two different stories. She switched every other chapter; I thought that that technique she used was really great. Well to wrap it up, I would just like to say you won't be wasting your time if you read this book."
2,This is not a 4.5 star book...,"I think the four-and-a-half star rating on this book is a bit high. The book jacket describes this story as ""chilling"" and promises to ""keep you guessing until the last page."" I didn't find either to be true. Half the would-be suspense is removed when the entire plot is plainly outlined in the first ten pages by the narrating character. The ending to the ""mystery"" in the parallel story in the past is telegraphed right from the beginning. I'm normally terrible at figuring out mysteries and I guessed the whole thing by page 50. The writing is adequate but very stark, to the point where you cannot really sympathise with the characters, not even the one who is telling the story in the first person. The descriptions of the Maine coast are accurate and poetic, but they only make the rest of the story and characters seem even flimsier in comparison. If this is what passes as good LitFic these days I'll stick with my genre reading (SF, horror, and fantasy) and my Dickens."
3,Confused....,Am I the only one perplexed? What did I miss? I liked the story and the writing style but I didn't get the connections or the ending. Who was related to who? And who was the ghost...Claris? What did the 'ghost' want and why?
3,Good to occupy time,"I got this book because it was recommended to N Sparks fans. I don't think it was anything like an N Sparks novel. This book was different for me I did enjoy the love story in it, but I don't think I'd read anymore of the authors books. Good to read once thru."
2,More Than You Know,I was not impressed with this book. I read it. Perhaps I just couldn't get into the whole ghost thing. I felt it was weak at the ending.
5,Scary and delightful,"Hannah Gray, an elderly woman, returns to the house she summered in as a young woman and decides to tell us the story of the summer she spent falling in love and being terrorized by a ghost. Her story is separated by the story of a family who lived on the island across from Hannah's old summer house over 100 years prior to that fatefull summer. The love story is intense and unforgettable, the ghost story is scary as hell (the scene with the ghost in the rocking chair kept me awake the night after I read it!), and the connection between Hannah's ghost and the old island family that slowly emerges as the stories progress will totally surprise you. I could not put this down once I picked it up. It's FANTASTIC."
4,Heartbreaking,"This was my first Beth Gutcheon novel and it was wonderful. The parallel stories were both interesting and the author built so much suspense between the two that I wanted to hurry through the next story to get back to the first story! The way that she incorporated an ""account"" of the murders made for a varied read and was much appreciated. I felt sad and heartbroken at the end. The author tugged at my emotions in a very genuine way. I look forward to reading more of her work."
3,Just What I Expected - Maybe More,"When I read blurbs on the back by Susan Isaacs and Anne Rivers Siddons I figured this would be somewhat trashy and I was right. The characters were standard: lonely young girl, mean stepmother, handsome wild boy etc. But the writing was straightforward and capable and it kept my interest on a cold December evening and that's saying something. I read the entire book which is more than I can say for some literary fiction I've tried lately."
5,Reverberation -wow!!!,"Luckily for me a friend suggested this CD. A horror trip of 5 hours in a van with four children turned into a glorious journey. By the time we reached our destination we all had favorite cuts from this CD, King Island Christmas. This CD is sure a king among Christmas music.It doesn't take the place of the traditional Christmas tunes but it certainly deserves a place with them. Be sure to get it for your family."
4,"SPANGA - A vivacious ""Ball of Dynamite""","I first heard and saw this young lady, September 1996, purely by accident. It was at a supermarket carpark concert, in a small village outside of Bergamo, Italy. My favorite from that night was: WOLF ALONE, the title of her first Albumn, and performed in wolf suit. Her singing is fabulous in both Italian & English. I am presently living in Veracruz, Mexico, and my friends have also become Spanga fans."
4,Meh..,"Loved flatwound for a couple weeks, they get dirty and dead fast. Stick to roundwound. If you do go flatround, use these, they were the best of the different brands I tried."
5,Easy and Convenient Learning,"I wanted to learn danish because my wife comes from Denmark. However, like most people I have a hectic lifestyle, work long hours, and also have a young family. I bought this product for convenience so that I can learn Danish whilst driving 30 minutes to and from work.The CD's are easy to follow and continually build upon what you have already learnt. They repeat phrases and words frequently so that you can continually improve pronunciation and recall the words quickly. To date, I have learnt more Danish from these 10 Cd's than using the highly expensive Rossetta Stone. I strongly reccomend them to anyone getting started in the Danish language."
4,i'm learning danish,This program works but the only downside is that i am a visual learner and need to see the words i'm learning so i asked my danish fiance to help me out with that part. this cd is stricly audio which was disapointing but i gave this program a shot and i'm learning the language. thats all i could ask for.
5,Great book,It's about time someone did a comprehensive study of the Horsman company and the wonderful dolls they made. This is a book that will prove valuable to all serious researchers and collectors. Let's hope Jensen will write more books of this caliber.
2,No way!,"There are only two great tracks on this album, ""Wasted"" and ""Panzermench"". The rest of the album is a dudd. I am much more impressed by the records And One put out after this album..verry dissapointing synth pop album, but those two good tracks are really, really, really good."
3,Has some good tips,This little book has some good tips for a small little booklet. The price was good. I did learn about some supplements that might be helpful for a diabetic and a few other tips. Just an okay booklet though.
5,OMG If you have diabetes...,Get this book! I can tell you for sure in 2 months...you wont have diabetes anymore and that means no more pills or insulin too! take your life back!!!!!!!
3,Twisting of Scripture,"I had mixed reactions to this book. The information about diabetes is excellent. But the use of Scripture, taken out of context, to say what it is not saying is sad. Many of the verses he uses, such as the one that asserts that God will heal our diabetes because ""by His stripes we are healed,"" are misused. That particular passage deals with our sin, not our physical healing. As is too often the case, it appears another author has ""baptized"" his good advice with Scripture taken out of context to market it to the Christian community.I am a believer, in fact, I am a retired Army chaplain. I believe in prayer. I don't believe in twisting Scripture to market an otherwise fine book!"
2,Good but lacking,"I was a little dissappointed in this book. The title seems to promise hope for a cure. Most of the advice, however, seems to be aimed at managing, not curing, this disease. My biggest problem with the book is that not enough counsel is given to help sufferers realize that disease is more spiritual than physical."
4,Not your 60's Morgan,"Lee Morgan was listening to the Miles Quintet and was ready to leave his 'Sidewinder' days behind. That says a lot about the man who was expected to write bogaloo songs for the rest of his career. This is a different kind of Lee Morgan record, and a little diffcult at first if you are expecting a classic hard bop live album. Thanks to Blue Note for releasing a 3 CD, documenting the best of 3 nights at the Lighthouse. The sound is not the best it could be, you need to crank it up, but that is the only minor flaw for a stellar release."
2,Helpful for beginner's only,"I bought it thinking I would get lessons on strategy, but it is an elementary primer. Don't buy this if you want to learn tactics, openings, strategy of anykind. And, three discs that could have been condensed to one because they were trying to sell you a three disc set to get more money out of you. It could all have been done on one if they had cut out the lousy (and I mean LOUSY)production elements."
3,Not quite what I expected...,I thought for the price this would be much better quality. But it serves it's purpose regardless...
5,"You're wife, girlfriend, mistress or whatever will LOVE this stuff!",What can you say. It's Versace. It's quality product. Smells awesome. My fiance absolutely loves this stuff. A must gift for a guy for his girl!
5,Great Gift!,"This Versace perfume set was a great gift I purchased for my girlfriend,she loved it. If your looking to buy perfume for your woman, I do recommend this item highly."
4,Nusrat breaks loose,"This is a good collection of the traditional qawwali which Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan glorified in. It is blend of the heavy instruments, lovely tunes and above all the mystifying voice of Nusrat. It is indeed worth listening for anyone with a flavour of hard rock qawwali. It might be too heavy for an admirer of Nusrat's pop works but still it is an essential listening. It symbolises the true music that Nusrat is known for. So you can expect anything and everything in this collection, from the finesse touch of Nusrat to him going wild. Whats more, if u listen to it once, you will be forced to listen to it again, and again, and again..."
4,Even Us Neophytes Can Enjoy It,"My first Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan album (in fact, my first album in this genre at all), and I'm both satisfied and pleased. The pieces are lenghty but not boring - the music tended to move a bit to the background and propel me along doing whatever it is I'm doing while listening. Further listens will probably reveal more, but I can certainly use more albums of this type. I'll probably be clearing off more room on the ""K"" shelf..."
4,a worthwhile read,"This was a well-written novel w/ a fairly fast-paced plot. My only gripes: Elizabeth Lackersteen was an annoying twit so I don't understand why Flory & MacGregor were so interested in her. Also, Flory's cowardice was exasperating at times. I wanted to slap him & tell him to get himself together. But overall, a good read though not as interesting as say, Passage to India or Jewel in the Crown."
3,"Superb writing, distressing story","George Orwell beautifully describes the setting, the climate and the characters (although I had to create my own cast of characters at first to keep the Englishmen straight in my mind), but I couldn't get past the depressing story. The English men (and the two women) were shallow, and prejudiced against the natives, and also cruel. It may have been an accurate description of the times (1920's), but it was difficult to accept that the colonists were so indifferent to the lives of the Burmese who worked for & served them. The main character, Flory, who supposedly cared for those natives he knew, wavered when it came to defending them against the cruelty of his countrymen who were stationed there. I can't fault Orwell's descriptions -- I came to feel that stifling and oppressive atmosphere, and the soul-sucking isolation. The ending is a real downer. If I hadn't been reading the book for a book club group, I don't know if I would have read to the end."
3,Good account of life in colonial Asia,"If anyone wants to know how English colonials in India/Burma/Asia etc truly behaved--their racism, their ignorance, their arrogance, their lack of humanity--then this is a good book to read. Being of half-Indian descent, I had a particular interest in this book. It does a wonderful job in giving an account of the mentality and attitudes of the British Raj, though it does often move a bit slow (ie it gets boring at times). I would recommend it for anyone with an interest in the subject."
3,Good picture of the era and time,"I was interested in this book for a better picture of what Burma was about, and I guess, for that period, it was educational. It was written in kind of a plodding British style, which I felt I had to mentally slow myself down for, which made for kind of a tedious read. I could only read so much at a time, without having to return to ""normal speed"" of existence. The story it told unfolded in a proper manner, and the ending at first was a bit of a surprise in a way, though in retrospect, was actually a logical conclusion. I really felt sorry for the dog. Worth reading if you want to endure a depiction of British occupation and one man's existence in a land way back when, but not if you're expecting an action packed or humorous novel, or a sense of what is Burma is like at this point in time."
3,a disapointment to Orwell fans,"Fans of 1984 will be sorely disapointed in this book but it is enjoyable enough if you enter it with incredibly low expectations. It is the story of a man, Flory, who lives in English Burma. There he lives a meaningless existence. Until a women arrives and changes everything. Depressing but not to depressing that it is unbelievable. If you have anything else you've been wanting to read. Read that instead."
1,Burmese Days stinks,i was disgusted by the behavior of the British in this book and felt like i did not need to read more of it. i only read 30% into it but did not like it at all
2,Insightful but boring,"I read this book because it was written by George Orwell, and Animal Farm is one of my favourite books of all time.The interesting parts of this book are its descriptions of Burma. Burma is such a foreign land, and few stories exist in its setting.Many people love this book for its comments on racism... I didn't learn anything new. People are people. They form groups and screw each other. Big deal?I couldn't have cared less if the book ended with the earthquake, by every character dieing off in one whollop.It took a concentrated effort to finish this book."
3,eh,"Burmese Days is the story of a self-conscious English gentleman, Flory, who is repulsed by the actions of his fellow Englishmen, and wishes to find someone with whom he can share the love/hate relationship he has with Burma and the Burmese. He thinks he finds this person in Elizabeth Lackersteen, but slowly realizes how shallow and arrogant she really is.It addresses issues like race and assimilation well, and has interesting characters, but I felt detached and bored while reading it. The plot is rather outlandish, and the ending was predictable, though the book has a lot of irony and even laugh-out-loud moments.An OK book, but I expected more from Orwell."
3,On the old side.,Although pretty aged- it showed up in great condition for being a 196-- something book! The cover was a little cracked but that was about it!
5,Excellent ActiveX section.,The book has an excellent ActiveX section. It shows tips to add practical features to your ActiveX controls that are absent from other books. The chapters illustrate the steps required to mark your own ActiveX controls as safe to initialize and script. These steps are required to surpress Internet Explorer's security warnings which can be confusing to your users.
5,Another view,"Unlike ""a customer"" who spammed the review section with four sneering, unsupported expressions of personal opinion, I found this book to be stupendous. Kriyananda's integrity is transparent - he hides nothing, even when it could be used against him. He refrained for 20 years from responding to the campaign of spreading false rumors and lies that SRF mounted against him. And in this, his response, it is clear that his heart is free of defensiveness or resentment. He has never once stooped to the level of the hatred that SRF has expressed toward him. His courageous love has been his triumph. That it has been richly rewarded is evident to the thousands who know him today - in his aura of divine bliss, joy, and unfailing compassion and kindness."
3,Decent but not spectacular,"Call of Duty is a decent game by all accounts. I have played many, many, many video games over the years and this one is about average in my estimation. I found the controls to be somewhat frustrating at times, and the plot was rather lame (world war 2 again???). The gameplay is moderately fun though, especially riding in the vehicles. I especially enjoyed driving the tank, although the mission itself was somewhat difficult.Overall, I give this game an average rating. It is worth the price, but there is nothing new here, and I would rather play Medal of Honor again."
1,Problem with Vista,"Does not work in Vista. I liked the game in earlier versions of Windows, but it simply will not load in Vista."
3,"Dont bother with the set, I recommend getting COD2 a la carte","Call of Duty 2 is awesome! You can purchase it used for under $10 (including shipping) if you buy it used through Amazon.I highly discourage getting the ""War Chest"" set, which includes the first installment with an expansion release, since COD 1 gameplay is very dated and nowhere as polished as the sequel."
3,Loved it with exceptions.,This is another game that most of it worked but some levels needed to be skipped because they just wouldn't load. The Call of Duty 2 part worked flawlessly.
4,Good value,"Although I like the Medal of Honor series better, This package is a good value for those looking for another WWI shooter game."
2,this book is not that good,"Bobby is a little league baseball player who is way to full of himself. At the end after 200 pages of reading about him playing baseball, he decides that he's not that good and that he should become a writer. I didnt like it at all and it's definetely not worth reading."
3,baseball book,I am reading the realistic fiction book called Bobby Basball written by Robert Kimmel Smith.Bobby Baseball is about a boy named Bobby who was anxious all winter to play for his dad's team the Eagles. He wants to be a pitcher and be in the hall of fame. When it is finally baseball season he asked his dad to pick him but his dad might not. Bobby brother tells him that Bobby not might want to be on his dad's team because if he does something wrong his still his coach and has to tell him even if he yells. Bobby's dad tells him that if he gets in trouble and tells him to run there is no arguing. You'll have to read the book to find out if Bobby gets on his dad's team or someone else's. You will also find out what he does in his games.I thought this book is very good for people who love baseball like myself.
4,knowledge filled,I ordered this book as a tool for a college class. There is a lot of emotional information involved in this reading. Full of interest for anyone interested on the past and present structures of the family lifes.
2,Bible Topics series,"I love anything Jesus related, However, I bought a couple of these books and for lack of a better word, I found them to be flemsy? super thin considering the Bible is jam packed with knowledge. I have to say I was disappointed with the quality and felt they were a waste of money as In have other books ofn similar topics. to give an idea, I beleave the book was approx one quarter of an in thick, I knew just by the sheer size, there was not much to it. I will pass it on to someone who can use it perhaps. Maybe a blessing in disquise."
5,Fun and funny for Beatles fans!,"The spirit of the Beatles lives on in this satire on both the Beatles and their historians! This is a fun book for Beatles fans who are willing to laugh at the music and musicians they love. It's a humorous, irreverent romp, very tongue-in-cheek and not the least bit serious. While it poses as another stodgy analysis of all Beatles compositions, it really has more in common with the Monty Python flavored ""Rutles"" film. Old-time drawings make it more fun & visually stimulating. To quote Mr. Kite, ""A pleasant time is guaranteed for all!""Partial Cast: Steve Allen/Julie Andrews/Chet Atkins/Lucille Ball/Orson Bean/Chuck Berry/Victor Buono/Johnny Carson/Eric Clapton/Neil Diamond/Judy Garland/The Stones/LBJ/Tim Leary/Lancelot/Laurel & Hardy/Peggy Lee/Rich Little/Maharishi/Harpo Marx/Rev Moon/Moriarty/Nixon/Elliott Ness/Peter Noone/Elvis/Billy Preston/Claude Rains/Rocky & Bullwinkle/Phyllis Schlaffley/Sinatra/Phil Spector/Tiny Tim/Alan Watts/Tarzan/Lawrence Welk"
5,1828 Webster's Dictionary,"This book is not only beautiful, but a wonderful resource tool and a faithful reproduction of the original--no well-educated home should be without a copy!"
4,Noah Websters 1828; American Dictionary of The English Langu,"Fantastic. Although I did find a mis - spelling, I believe it was due to a typo in the translation.Noah Webster's dictionary terms are on target and provide a basis for research into other fields such as law, the Constitution of the united States of America, as well as other areas."
1,Public Domain material,"This is way too expensive for material that passed into public domain a long, long time ago. But it is interesting to see how word meanings have changed in the last 184 years."
5,A Must In Our Library,"Shipping was fast, item was packed well and in excellent shape. Although we will soon have this electronically, that won't take the place of the book itself. I use it frequently, keeping it close at hand with my Bible study aids. I also use the dictionary often in educating our 6 year old granddaughter on slang and vulgar words (she brings home), then teach her what scriptures say about them. It's been most effective."
5,Quality of Dictionary is Superb! A great addition to my library.,"Many might be hesitant of purchasing this dictionary because of the price. I jumped in and decided to buy it. When it arrived, I was immediately impressed with the overall quality with which it was published. A good binding, and beautiful cover combined very well with a famous dictionary to make this item a great addition to my library. I highly recommend to others that they purchase of this dictionary."
3,"Mostly good stuff, but too many strings tracks","Early recordings from the Brit pianist that include quite a few ""with strings"" tracks that can be a bit syrupy. Even so, you also get some good stuff with Latin percussion that Shearing helped popularize at the time. Not the best sampler, but far from a bust either."
3,Not good but not too bad,"Program too short with not enough action we want... Where is Kobe? Where is LeBron James? Oh yes, i didn't expect Kobe because i can't see him on the cover, but LeBron?? He shared 1/4 of photos on the cover but where is he inside?? well, 2 shots! I found the DVD had featured more Ricky Davis than LeBron, but you'll know LeBron is a good passer too! Disappointed..."
3,Not The Best,"Kobe Bryant was one of last years best dunkers, but not even one trace of him! They had Corey Maggette, but no Kobe?I seriously don't understand that, and back then, he wasn't charged for assault.Most footage is good, but with bad camera angles.The host DJ Clue is poor, his way of talking makes him seem like he doesn't know much about basketball.You should buy Ankle-Breakers, there is tons of dunking footage along with crossovers and swift moves.This is like the incomplete version of the NBA series.The NBA Ankle Breakers has something like this whole set with Stephon Marbury.This is a bad version for twenty dollars.When I bought this, I hoped for dunks that would have me out of my seat.These dunks shown are bad, not even exciting!I just sat there waiting to jump in excitement, I almost had to act it out.Save you money, and if you want real dunks, buy NBA: The Foundation All-Star 2004"
5,Great Quality! Shipped quickly!,The quality was great for the price. It met my expectations. And it shipped very quickly. I bought this item as a Christmas present for my brother. He loved it.
1,"dunks, dunks and more dunks","This is a great dvd, though there wasnt enough shaq dunks it was really good. You will love it if oyu can get past DJ CLue, that guy sucks the bag. Just the way he talked annoyed me greatly. but the DVD was awesome. a must have..."
3,A little small but cute,It's a little smaller that perceived. It's also a little finger puppet which is cute. My daughter loves mice and likes it enough.
5,merfairies magic!,these small dolls are perfect hand held toys and are so bright and beautiful the girls (all under 8) LOVE them ;they are cute !
2,WEAK AND OVER HYPED,There is nothing new or fresh about this. It is 70's music remixed. The first three songs all sound exactly alike. If you are one of those people that likes the same beat looped and dancing to that beat for like 15 minutes straight - than pop a pill and go for it. The best I can say is that MAYBE I would put this on as background music to make a transition from mellow to jumping. Nothing about this made me dance. I could not distinguish one song from the next. I listen to EVERY type of music and am willing to try anythign that will not make my ears bleed but I was totally dissapointed b/c I think this album is overhyped.Weak.
3,Dimitri means Disco,"If remixed Disco is your thing, you will absolutely LOVE this CD. Dimitri made a great mix for the wide variety of ages that would be shaking their groove thing at the PB Mansion. If you don't like Disco based Techno, you definitely need to skip this one."
3,Basic 70s sounding Disco,"I was expecting this record to sound like Sacrebleu. It is nothing like the lounge/exotic sound of that record. For good dance/funk music it is pretty basic and nothing too original. If you love old disco and have everything already it would be good to add to your collection. Otherwise, there is some old school stuff you could get before this one."
3,Better than the other Dimitri Albums........,It's O.k.. not bad can listen to.... wouldn't jump up and down or shout it from the roof tops.
3,Disco-ey,"Not as good as Sacrebleu, but I love the 60's retro lounge stuff. When I ordered this, I wanted something loungey but this is a little too 70's disco for my liking. But, if disco is your thing, you'll like this. I gave it three stars since the recordings are not bad, just not my taste."
4,Monkeysanta from Paris!,"This is a good cd--very disco heavy, but certain to get the ladies movin' if you're having a party. If you like this one, check out Lazy Dog!"
3,Sure is a lot of disco...,"I have to admit, I was taken aback by just how closely Dimitri follows the old-fashioned disco sound. When people say disco these days, as often as not, they mean some form of disco-influenced dance music. Here, they mean disco.That's not necessarily bad (some might disagree, but ignore them). But if you're going to go really old school, make sure that you keep changing the dynamics and that you avoid clashing melodies. I don't think Dimitri does a very good job of either on this CD."
5,"Smoking Jacket Disco, Baby","This guy's a master mixologist. He spins with a respectful ear, even if he uses some fairly cheezy source material....it makes for some incredibly fun, danceable stuff...check out ""Reach Inside"" or ""Talking All That Jazz."" Oh, and if you get a chance to see him spin live, you're a fool if you miss it."
4,Perfect rice every time,"You might wonder why you would spend this kind of money on a rice cooker, when you could just cook the rice in a pot. How many times would you have to use this thing just to cook rice that cost as much as the cooker itself? (Answer, about a hundred times.)Well, maybe I have too much disposable income, but I love this thing. You fire and forget. That is, you forget until you start smelling the tempting aroma of the cooking rice. I have only cooked brown rice in it, and it comes out perfect every time. I've used other rice cookers that didn't understand brown rice -- this one does.It also keeps the rice warm for a day or two, so you can make a lot and use it. (After more than a day, you have to add a little water to keep it from drying out.)I highly recommend this cooker. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is the cost."
4,awesome rice cooker,"This thing makes the BEST rice. I usually only make 1 or 2 cups, and it doesn't turn any of it into mushy, overcooked clumps.I have a few nitpicks that detract from me giving it 5 stars. HOWEVER, unless a better rice cooker comes on the market, I'd guess that this is the best you can buy.--The display doesn't show you how much time is left until you get down to the last 5 minutes. You have to remember from previous experience about how long it takes. (e.g. brown rice is 1 hr 20 min for me)--The styling is, well, Japanese. It would be nice to have a different model for the US market that cosmetically fits in better with our other kitchen appliances."
5,THE BEST,"We decided to invest a little in a good rice maker.....this one is GREAT! We love it, so simple, smells the house up as good or better than fresh bread baking.....!!!!!"
5,Couldn't be happier,"We purchased this cooker based on the recommendations of others and I agree that it is a superb machine. We use this far more than I ever expected due to the ease of both use and cleanup. We cook a pot of rice and found it will easiy keep 3-4 days (if we don't finish it by then). I concur with other reviewers that with the GABA setting, the rice is softer than I prefer. All other settings work flawlessy"
4,cooks some great rice,"I'm giving this four stars instead of five only because it's so expensive. Although it does cook some great rice. I make white and brown rice in it at least once a week. I've used the warming feature overnight once and the rice was still good the next day.I don't know if it's worth the money, but, I love it."
3,Works ok,After reading all the reviews I was exited. But it turns out to be just ok for us since we know how to cook rice the old fashioned way. It does do a good job to prevent rice from being undercooked though. But it also takes twice as long to cook rice as other rice cookers and almost four times longer than using a regular pot. Averaging about 55 minutes.
1,Quality Control Failure ?,"I just finished returning the replacement for this cooker from amazon. The first one did not work for anything other than white rice and the second one has an out of control touchpad that spontaneously starts beeping all of a sudden. Looks like Zojirushi maybe having some quality control issues, according to even the Amazon customer service. Only saving grace is the fact that Amazon has been very good about the return process."
1,Not for people with Cardiac Pacemakers,"I was excited to receive the Induction Rice Cooker. However there is a specific warning in the instruction manual that people with cardiac pacemakers should not use this machine because it cooks with magnets which could affect the pacemaker's operation. This warning should be included in the manufacturers description. Because I am pacemaker dependent, I now have to go the the trouble and expense of shipping this rather large and heavy machine back to Amazon."
5,The worlds greatest rice cooker,We have had our zoji for a year and a half now and I don't think I could ever live without one now. I am a rice lover but I always mess up on my rice and it's either too hard or too soft but it is almost impossible to mess rice up with this machine. I love the quick rice function too because I don't always have 45 minutes to wait for my rice. We have everyone in my family looking into getting one. Granted its a little takai (expensive) but if you're a big rice eater and you're picky about the taste and texture of the rice this is worth the money.
3,A strong endorsement for the SETI program.,"Mr. Jakosky has presented his optimistic view for life on other planets, not just life, but intelligent life. His conclusions are in contrast to those reached by Stuart Ross Taylor's ""Destiny or Chance: Our Solar System and its Place in the Cosmos"". He has gone into a more exhaustive investigation of the creation of Earth and subsequent life than Taylor did in his book. However, I found it somewhat laborious to plow thru, tending to skip some passages. For anyone with an interest in the subject, I would recommend both books."
2,Just not funny,"Maybe Lenny appeals to those born before 1960, but this CD is just not funny. Whereas I think old Carlin, Foxx, Pryor and Cosby albums are great, this just isn't comedy. More social commentary than anything, and most of that is impossible to hear, due to Lenny's constant mumbling. He may be the master that inspired geniuses like Kinison, but his comedy is lost on today's comedy fans."
1,Waste of Time & Money,"Dated sounds from the 80's come back via this album, not that he is not a great musician,but this cd is far away from a masterpiece.Truely - NOT MY STUFF!."
1,Overproduced garbage,I can not believe how many people liked this album. All the soloing is overdubed and uninspired. It is simply not jazz.
4,Thiller Miller is back!,"From 'Power' to 'Your Amazing Grace', Marcus is putting it all on display for the music listener to enjoy. Though not as personal as 'Tales', it is still nontheless as fiery and passionate. 'Lonnies Lament' and 'Nikkis Groove' are my personal faves, and Herbie Handcock's piano work on 'Goodbye Pork Pie Hat' is simply delicious. The string and horn arrangements add a breath of fresh air to the funk-hip/hop rhythms. But I wish he had used his Sadowsky 5 string fretted on this disc(see 'Ethopia' and 'Eric' on the Tales CD); I thought it added another dimension to his sound. Anyway, this is still a very enjoyable record. Being a fan since the early David Sandborn/Luther Vandross days, I'm getting a little miffed by all these bandwagon cats biting M.M.s chops and style; but I guess these days imitation, not originality and talent, is how you make a name for yourself(See New Kids on the Block and BackStreet Boys for details). Highly recommended for fans of funk/jazz."
3,Same Old Jazz Funk,You know I bought this CD on reviews claiming it to be new jazz grooves for the new millenium. I liked his Tales CD and thought there would be some great new stuff on this one. I was disappointing however as it includes the same old funk type grooves. Yes there are cool tunes and Marcus Miller's playing is awesome...but I was hoping for something....well new.
5,King of Funky Bass,"In my opinion, there are 3 bass players that are above all the rest, they are equal in stage, but different from each other like day and night: Jaco, with his creamy-silky soft sound, Patitucci, the master of the 5 and 6 strings bass, and Marcus Miller with his rough sound. Miller's sound is unique and has some natural toughness that keeps you on your toes through the album. Yet, it is a very cool sound, and if you play the bass, you'll find yourself copying it when you wanna feel cool (Bass Players- try the Marcus Miller style in Band-In-a-Box, it's so fun to improvise on it...). This album is a must for any bass players, and it's completing the basic trio that every bass player should know. If you listen to Jaco, Patitucci and Miller, you have, in my opinion enough knowledge about the different bass-sounds to start and develop your own personal sound. Very cool, and indeed a must."
5,The results are amazing!,"I discovered this product about a year ago by word of mouth. A few other ladies I know (who, by the way, do not look their age as a result) passed the secret on to me. I have been using Frownies for about a year now with outstanding results. I used to have noticable frown lines on my forehead and some wrinkles around my eyes. Since using this product, these lines have all but gone away, and when they do start to resurface, I make sure I use my Frownies that night and they smooth back out. I noticed results after the first useage, but the more I used them, the longer the results would last. Now I get looks of shock every time I tell someone my age, and I have Frownies to thank for it! I highly recommend this product!"
4,Excellent Natural Botox Alternative,"I have been using Frownies for years, usually purchased via mail order companies, but now with the ease and quickness of Amazon you can get them within a week. I try to apply these between my forehead almost every night, and even if I miss a night, my frown lines are much improved. I know this product is the eyes/mouth one, but I find this one better for my forehead than the regular forehead Frownies (however, I often keep both in my medicine cabinet). If you don't want botox or can't afford it, this is a reliable alternative, and don't pay attention to the naysayers who tell you it is uncomfortable, you hardly feel it on your face because they use a light, light adhesive that leaves no residue. One thing: don't over-water the shiny adhesive side before applying, and do keep your hand over the Frownie for a minute or so to keep it adhering, otherwise they occasionally peel off in the night."
1,Complete waste of money,"I have to wonder about all the 5 start reviews? My experience is:1. at bedtime-wash my face with facial cleanser2. apply them exactly as described on the package and website3. they barely stick on after spraying them with water4. go to sleep, wake up in a few hours, they are all aready came off5. in the morning pick up all the unstuck ""frownies"" and put them in the trash6. look in the mirror and see absolutley no difference whatsoever.Dont waste your time or money"
2,sensitive skin,"Despite excitedly believing in the concept of Frownies, they caused me to break out with zits after a few days & after a couple weeks of no results at all I stopped using them. Zits are much more unattractive than smile lines. I had no trouble getting them to stick on at night or come off in the morning. My face is usually fairly relaxed but I could feel how the Frownies stopped me from moving my face even more. People with highly developed facial expression wrinkles will probably notice a bigger change & I think they are worth trying if you can find at a local drug store where they are pretty cheap."
3,frownies,my mother wanted these so I ordered them for her. She said they were ok but after you apply them they dry hard like card board and she doesnt see much of a diff. in the wrinkles she was using them for.
2,Like a stamp on your face,Very uncomfortable and itchy... Didn't make it thru one night!. Hard like cardboard stuck to your face - save money and use an envelope flap instead!!
3,Uncomfortable,Sadly I have to report that I am not using my frownies....I vought them for some deep creases that had developed around my mouth. But they are uncomfortable to wear and don't stick as well as I hoped when used with face cream.
4,Good short term effect but long term effect still unknown,"Let me start with the cons: They are uncomfortable and stiff, so initially I had trouble keeping them on at night and couldn't resist pulling them off early. They are also a little bit painful to pull away. They suggest water, but I found in the end it was easiest to just pull them out. It doesn't seem to leave any redness behind (which I was worried about).The pros. It has a temporary effect of lifting the skin where you had them on, and even if it is for a short time ( maybe a few hours at most), it feels good. I believe they are also having long term effects on some of the fine lines, so I will continue to give these a go."
4,Good,They Worked very well and it made my wrinkles less visible.The patch for the dimples is not long enough.
3,It helps a little,"Frownies Forehead & Between Eyes, 144 PatchesThese patches seem to help reduce the expression of frown lines but will not make them go away in an 80-year-old face. It might help prevent frown lines if you start using them early on, like when you are forty."
5,LOVE FROWNIES,"Seriously, between my eyes, I see a huge difference when I use these. I can forget for a few days and then, WHOA, I am back on them. They stick nicely and come off only when I decide to take them off. They work by immobilizing the muscle...like botox but naturally letting the muscle become lax because it isn't always being used...the anti-workout. I use them all over my face where I notice expression lines and am a huge proponent. I am too broke for botox, but honestly, these work just as well for me. I am 42"
2,I actually hate it!,"You need to add water to the back of the patches for them to stick on your face. They don't stay very well by the outside corner of the eyes. When they stick, they feel so tight that I couldn't even yearn. I yearned twice and the patches just peeled on one sides.It would feel the same if you glue a piece of paper and put it on your face. it's that uncomfortable."
4,Good Stuff,"I have only been using these a short time and have noticed a difference already, The only thing is you have to get them on right or than can be uncomfortable but overall very good"
1,Worthless,This was a total waste of my money and my opinion is don't waste yours cause you'll regret it. Let nature take it's course.
4,Natural Botox?,"I must admit that they do work. They make the lines appear fainter in the morning when I remove the patches but it's kind of challenging to sleep with the patches all over. I guess it's something I 'll just have to get used to but I find that sometimes it's not worth the hassle and don't use them. Also, the patches could be smaller. I've had to cut them down. But again, they make my lines appear lighter.I did a post here: but prior to review:[...]"
2,frownies,This product is nothing but paper tape. when you pull the skin to apply the frownies the hard edge of the tape makes another crease. i would not recommend this product.
2,ummmm!,"interesting that the actors were also,wardrobe, props, director, producers, writers, set design etc. watch the credits at the end. someone had a dream to make a movie...this is as bare-bones as it gets...sound, script, acting----we had alot of laughs at their expense!!!"
1,Uncomfortable Fabric,"Warning - this is a cotton/polyester blend. If you want the comfort of 100% combed cotton, try Hanes Classics 3-pack Bikini Briefs instead."
1,wrong product shipped,"I ordered the ""Sport"" style briefs, not the ""bikini"" briefs which were sent to me. The descriptive material clearly promoted the ""sport"" brief style."
1,Not worth it,Not a big fan of this roaster. First unit we had the themostat burnt out after the second use. We figured it was a fluke and bought another since we overall enjoyed the size and ease of cleaning. After third use we can smell the thermostat burning and we believe it will only be a matter of time before this one burns out. We will not be replacing it with anothe HB product.
1,Don't Bother Ordering -- I'm Sending Mine Back,"My roaster arrived with a bent lid. I completed an online form with Hamilton Beach, which was ignored, and then called their Customer Service number; it was finally replaced -- with the wrong lid. The first time I used the oven it emitted smoke; I called Customer Service, and after waiting on hold for 15 minutes was told this is normal for a new oven -- although nothing in the instruction manual alerts the user to this fact.The roaster oven is billed as baking quicker than a conventional oven; it took twice as long to roast our dinner -- not half as long. The slow cooker function also did not work properly; after 10 hours on a low heat, I had to turn it to a high heat for a few more hours to complete the cooking.I am in the process of returning this product to Hamilton Beach."
1,$50 shipping costs!!!!!,While this may be a good product for the listed price this sellers (AplusSmile)outrageous shipping charges brings this reasonabley priced unit to a VERY poor value for the money. Amazon marketplace should not allow this sort of underhanded pricing practices from their merchants.
4,GOOD SIZE FOR THE PRICE,I WAS PLEASED WITH THE ROASTER AND THE SIZE MAKES IT USEFUL FOR ALOT OF THINGS.
3,As Is,"Phil Collins' debut album title says everything about the approach to this LP. This album begins with ""In The Air Tonight"" with its quiet, night time feel until nearly the end when the other instruments emerge from the darkness. Baring feeling over subtle tones on ""This Must Be Love"" gives a sense of authenticity. ""The Roof Is Leaking"" is a tale of despair and struggling with everyday life. ""Droned"" is an intense instrumental that has some sort of story to fit somewhere in-between. To add to the feeling of love ""You Know What I Mean"" has the effects of motion picture song all over it. On to a more up step ""Thunder And Lighting"", it is laced with a horn section to get you up. And the most heartfelt and sorrow drowned song, ""If Leaving Me Is Easy"", is about his real life story of his wife leaving while he was on tour. Maybe she should have listened to this as much as I have and had a change of heart. This is the beginning of what Phil had to offer and its well worth checking out."
5,Save yourself lots of dough,"I have used Nolo products for years. Both to help understand the law and it's processes even when using an attorney and to do some of my own legal work. I recently won a law suit of just over $150,000. The looser (in every sense of the term) had the assets but just wouldn't pay up. My attorney didn't do this kind of work, the court won't help (much) and the services that do this kind of work wanted 35%! I was not going to give up over $50,000 for what seemed like a fairly straightforward process. With this book it was a straightforward process. Within several days I had identified the assets (more than enough to satisfy the judgment) and was able to file the correct forms and follow the correct process. Within 45 days I had my money and could get on with my life."
4,how to win your law suit when you win in california,"This a super purchase, since I am in the mist of collecting a judicial judgment. The only thing that would make it better is if, a CD came with the book with FORMS on it ( ready to fill out).JR"
2,good when it actually works,"I've only had this camera 3 months and already I've experienced a million problems with it. some days the camera won't even turn on, other days it functions beautifully. I just can't figure it out. the software is also unreliable. one moment the camera allows me to upload photos and the next moment it won't. I don't know if I got a defective one or what, but if you are looking for something more reliable I wouldn't go with this because its performance varies like the weather."
3,Capture Speed is a little slow.,"I purchased this camera for my daughter. She was looking for a digital that was in the price range of $100. She has reported that the capture speed is a little slow and is not a good choice to catch an active toddler. Also the view finder displays are dark and grainy if you do not have a lot of light. She reports that once the picture is saved the quality is very good but it is difficult to see what she is shooting. She has also had some problems with the camera 'freezing' which required removing the batteries and reinserting them. This may be a defect and she is checking with the manufacturer to see if this is something they can fix. Pictures taken outside are the best quality shots. On a whole, she is okay with the camera for the price range, she was not expecting it to be a top of the line camera."
4,Raves for HP,"I bought this for my mother...she loves it! Its easy for her to use and the screen is large enough for her to view. The print quality is excellent. I got more (merchandise and quality) with this HP brand than I would had with any other brand. The price was excellent too. Good job Hewlett Packard for making me a ""smart"" person!"
4,Excellent Choice,"An excellent camera. Easy to use, great quality photos, and very resistent. If you are going to take it to a trip this is the perfect camera. It only has 2 little problems, 1.-it is a little bigger than the others, 2.- the rechargeable batteries included don't last very long."
2,Disappointed,"We have had our camera and printer for one year now. We loved having the sole printer for the camera, but I haven't been too happy with the quality of the pictures from the camera. Also, the printer now no longer works."
2,Used and in bad shape,I don't remember reading this item was used. It was probably written and I didn't see it. Its my fault if that's the case but even then I'm not satisfied because this camera was not in good shape at all. Not only it had scratches but some metallic parts were rusty.
1,Camera broke only 3 uses!!,Purchased this camera Nov 2006 but never took it out of the box to use until Aug 2007. Used it 3 times and the camera BROKE! HP wants $70 for customer support to talk to me since it has been over a year. What kind of camera breaks after 3 uses?? HP has very poor quality products.
5,Easy to use,"Gave this to the in-laws for Cristmas and they were taking pictures the next time we went to visit. Definitely buy additional memory, the internal memory is really more of a back-up."
3,"A good deal, a fair camera","I had to have the camera replaced by HP because it never really would stay ""on"" for more than a few shots. The process was so bad, I'll never by another HP camera. The printer is the older series, using #95 cortridges, so they are not waterproof. But it prints just fine."
5,Real Camera for Real People,"This camera is best among its class. The LCD displace is so brigh and high resolution. All buttons are very well organized so easy to use. Special flash recycle so fast and strong makes the shooting indoor and dark area an experience. The software menu is so easy to reach. I got SLR Pentax Digital Camera before, but can't tell the difference in picture quality."
5,Totally impressed,"I bought this digital camera as my first one for my birthday and I'm sastisfied. The camera's price was 179$ CDN (~ 159$ USD) at The Source by Circuit City. The box included Ni-Mh batteries so, I didn't have to buy them for now. What I didn't like, it's that the camera can't start with my Pure Energy Alkaline Batteries...I bought a 256Mb SD card (19.99$ CDN at the upper shop. ^^) and you can take ~ 155 photos at normal 5 mpx and ~99 while on optimal 5 mpx.I shot, zoomed filmed, etc. around 40 photos and the batteries lost a bit of their energy. (At first, the pointer was on the 1st ""O"" of GOOD and then it went between ""G"" and ""O"")Pros:- Good pictures- Love doing macro pictures :)Cons:- Bad video quality (well, duh! It's not a camera recorder.)- Doesn't take normal alkalines batteriesI never got a digital camera before, but it gives the features I needed."
4,good for the price,"This camera hasn't given me any problems. Some have complained of low battery life, but that is due to using regular batteries. I use the rechargeable camera batteries for days at a time without recharging. I am still playing around with the printer, but my first test print was good."
1,What a disappointment!,"We got this camera for Christmas, took one shot, and then the camera shut off completely with the lens out. HP Customer Service was not helpful. It's an internal problem with the circuitry. We pay freight for a repair or replacement on a BRAND NEW CAMERA. And NO PICTURES of Christmas! We purchased this camera after reading multiple positive reviews."
4,I cancelled this order!!,I canceled this order because shipment wasn't going to arrive in time for christmas.
4,Nice package,"Good camera and photo printer, easy to use. Only thing missing is a multi-card reader. Easy transfer to computer and printing pictures from computer. Good software for most photo editing."
3,Adequate Camera,"I like the camera and the ease of use; however, when I registered the camera on HP's website, a bunch of garbage got downloaded into my computer and I've been dealing with the aftermath for quite sometime. I never had problems with my computer until I used this camera. Nice camera, but beware of problems migrating to your computer."
3,Great CD But Remastering Is Questionable.,"The rerelease of Savatage ""The Wake Of Magellan"" is a great cd. According to the product description it says this cd is remastered. I not sure if that is true. The cd does not play loud enough to be a truly remastered cd. Especially since there is 24 bit mastering available. I did a test to compare the Savatage rerelease with two other remastered cds, AC/DC and Blind Guardian. I played the Savatage cd, AC/DC cd and Blind Guardian cd at the same volume. The test results: both AC/DC and Blind Guardian cds play two times louder than the Savatage rerelease. ""The Wake Of Magellan"" cd is great but the remastering could be better, mainly louder. My advice, wait and see if Japan rereleases the Savatage cds as a blue spec, hq or shm cd. If the Japanese does a great job of remastering, most likly the cds will sound better and play louder."
5,Like - Baretta - Season One DVD,"I bought this for my husband who used to watch Baretta and it brought back a lot of old memories of what life was like in TV in the 70s...recommend to anyone who enjoys these old shows, and anyone who might want to see what they were like if you're from the younger set and weren't around in the 70s. :)"
2,defective discs,"Have purchased used DVD's before, but this is the first time when the discs were bad and many of the shows won't play"
1,Waiting for a commitment...,I'm not buying season one till I see season 2 released... If season 2 never gets released I'll simply pick up a used one on Ebay.
4,Don't roll dem dice if ya can't pay da price...,"Talk about a trip down memory lane... This was my second favorite TV show of the era (the first being Kolchak: The Night Stalker -- please put that collection on DVD, too!!!), mainly because of the true performance of Robert Blake, who was basically playing himself as a cop. There's some really great stuff in this collection, although I would've liked to have seen more of the highly underrated Andrew Prine (Tony's partner Stringbean). Although the show screams 70's, there is an underlying saddness to the character and life of Tony Baretta who, in spite of his sometimes nearly superhuman antics, is just a regular gamoche like the rest of us. He is a prime example of the phrase 'never say die' even when the whole world seems to be on your case. Art imitating life, or the other way around? Highly recommended for fans of this genre, and come on season two!"
5,Rare Story!,"This is a rare look at a fascinately woman, brilliant in her own right, hidden in the shadows of her husband's enormous notoriety. So often we never get a chance to hear of the woman behind the ""great"" man, but this documentary tells the story of the woman behind the Father of Modern Physics quite eloquently. Mileva's story makes one ponder the influence and effects one could have on their spouses' work and passions. It makes you wonder had Albert not been married to such a brilliant woman, would he have reached such excellence?"
3,She IS the Other Einstein!,"The materials are indeed well-presented, given the amount of background available on her (there is some redundancy with Isaacson's book Einstein: His Life and Universe). The sound on the DVD that I have is not the best quality, with treble and bass not well balanced; but it is tolerable. For the price of this DVD the quality should be better."
4,Forgotten gem,"I've never forgotten Total Eclipse from this album and have been trying to track down a copy for years. This and With Closed Eyes were moderate hits in the early 80's and even made it to Countdown. You can see the video of Total Eclipse on youtube now. I couldn't believe the band and the album had vanished from the face of the Earth, but at one point even a google search yielded absolutely nothing about it. I was very suprised therefore to see it re-released in the US. These two songs, and the rest of the album, are really strong. Very much of their era, as is the cover art, its highly recommended."
5,A Constant Reference,"I have been a publisher for over 30 years and I can testify, Pocket Pal is one of the best selling books in the industry. Condensed and concise, it gets right to the point on type, prepress, printing, postpress, paper and so on. There is even a history of type and printing. Glossary.This 4.25 x 7.25, 234-page goldmine will be a constant reference for typesetters, publishers and printers. DanPoynter@ParaPublishing.com."
5,Excellent Kindle Edition of a Christian Classic,"The Christian Ministry by Charles Bridges is one of my favorite books. I am thankful that this classic treatise on pastoral ministry is now available in a Kindle edition of such top-notch quality. If you are looking for an excellent Kindle edition of this book, then look no further."
3,A Hard Read,"This book appears to be a very good book with valuable information concerning ministry from its foundation through Pastoring. However because this book was originally written so long ago (1830), it was written in the old English style of writing which makes the majority of the book hard to understand. For instance, please see the following excerpt, ""The Divine orignal of the Christian Ministry has already opened a view of its dignity far above any earthly honour or elevation, and such as the infidel scoff can never degrade. An institution- introduced to the world, and confirmed to the Church, with such solemn preparation-conversant with the interets, and entrusted with the charge, of immortal souls-ordained as the main instrument for the renovation of the world, and the building up of the Church-cannot be of inferior eminence."" Like I said, good book with alot of good information but written in a language far before my time. Can you repeat that in English please?"
5,Lankhmar ... the city of the black toga,"I guess some people just don't recognize quality. To see that someone has actually compared the award winning Ill Met in Lankhmar with a thieves world series book ... well, there you go.Great, collossal, archetypal, characters. Dense writing that conveys more in 200 pages than an Eddings or Jordan could do in 1000. A supreme mind (Leiber) writing at the peak of his talents."
4,Quite Good.,"I enjoy many types fantasy/sci-fi and must say Leiber's series is a refreshing change from sprawling fantasy epics. Alas, that he is not as well known as he seemed to be 25 years ago. Fafhrd and Mouser are an original fantasy duo.The next book, ""Swords Against Death"" is my favorite and I found it better to read that one before ""Swords & Deviltry."" Each book collects multiple stories and places them in storyline order rather than in the order they were written.Cheers."
4,Let the magic begin,"Swords & Deviltry is the first of a series books chronicling the adventures of Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser. It is not a novel, but rather three connected stories.The first ""The Snow Women"" tells of what prompts Fafhrd's abrupt departure from the cold northern wastes in order to seek a new life in the believed civilized lands. His escape is aided with the help of the woman he had come to love.""The Unholy Grail"" tells of the first adventures of the Grey Mouser, his victory over his lover's evil father and the origins of his name.A Nebula was awarded to the third story ""Ill met in Lankhmar"" and recounts the first meeting between the two heroes.While the first two stories are good, it is only when our heroes meet that the magic really begins. Leiber is an excellent writer and the Swords series featuring Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser are among the best of the genre."
3,"Vengeance, magic and a heavily structured plot.","The three stories inside this book, of Fafhrd and Gray Mouser, remind me a little of the Thieves World series. But, unlike those stories, these stories feel forced, their characters unrealistic and too powerful, their plots too simple and the settings too confused with overwhelming details that are not needed. While some details, details that I would enjoy about the history or background of the people or lands, are totally missing.For example, I wanted to know more about the city of Lankhmar, yet the third story barely touches on it. True, there are only three stories, so how much information can I get about the city? But I still felt cheated - it WAS the title of the book. With just under 200 pages I felt as if I paid too much. And that's rare for me, no matter how bad the book is."
4,Cute and bright!,"Super Pocoyo is a collection of small Pocoyo episodes which are great for kids with small attention spans or just as something quick to watch. In Pocoyo there is a narrator that talks but other than that the characters only make a few sounds/words every now and then. It is a cute and simple show great for preschoolers. My 2 year old actually cracked up when watching this DVD and then I laughed because I couldn't figure out what he was laughing at! The animation is bright, colorful and full of fun shapes but as far as a plot goes there really isn't one. The show just has Pocoyo and his friends doing simple tasks and small adventures. It is not really meant to be educational but rather ""learning through laughter"" and showing friendship."
4,Longest available one,This DVD is about 90+ min of Pocoyo with about 20 min of previews. Fortunately the majority of the previews are after the show. One nice feature is that this does loop. Either way there is a very happy 3yr old girl now.
4,Just what he wanted,Pocoyo is an aquired taste for a kids dvd. My grandson is 3 and just LOVES him. And when he saw that there was a super hero Pocoyo..he kept asking for it. He loves it. He copies everything Pocoyo does on screen.
1,Product was scratched old library DVD,DVD came in a box labeled King County Library System. The dvd itself was scratched could not play it. Payed over $9.00 with shipping.
5,"Very interesting, well produced, lots of good information.","The only critizism I have is that it lacks a certain punch. Elbert Hubbard was a really funny guy! He had a sharp wit and could really crack people up. They should have included more humorous episodes to lighten things up. I hate to critisize though, because it is a really great story, well told, and they did a fine job. It flows smoothly, has great historical photos and sets, and gives a fair and balanced view of a very complicated man."
2,Germany's Best Kept Secret... let's keep it that way.,"I dunno, but this album just isn't all that great. Sure, it's got catchy songs with bursts of hard guitar, but there's really nothing new or different about it. The album just sounds overpolished and acceptable, as if they didn't want to take a risk and alienate the masses. I do have to agree with the other reviewers in the sense that I'm surprised they haven't made it big yet; MTV eats this hohum stuff up all the time.Maybe they're better live, or maybe they're just better quiet."
1,self agrandizing,Interesting stories but very self agrandizing book with little to say to experienced runners. If you are looking for inspiration try 'Born to Run' by McDougall.
5,extremely helpful,"If you depend very much on logic in your thinking, as I do, then you will find this book extremely helpful.Because logic is a product of biological evolution, you can expect to encounter limits and problems in applying it.Logic is not the panacea it is often portrayed as. You need to know what those limits and problems are in order to avoid unnecessary mistakes when you apply it.This book demonstrates those limits and problems.This book complementsWithin Reason: Rationality and Human Behavior."
5,Handel,"I am not an expert in sound reproduction or classical music, in fact, I am an expert in nothing. I thoroughly enjoy all of Handel's music and will probably have to replace this down the road when my copy is not returned."
3,STEREO not multichannel!!!!!!!!!,"I just received my copy of ""Water Music ... "", haven't played it yet . I am disappointed. I've got ""Bach's 4 Toccatas... and Boulez conducta Bartok "" which are 'Multichannel';I've got a number of copies of ""Water Music and Royal Fireworks"" on Analogue SQ Quad LP and on 2.0 stereo CD.Because it was grouped with ""Bach & Bartok"" (which I also have on SQ Quad LP),I thought the ""enhanced"" moniker meant that it was also in 'multichannel'format.So now I have ' another ' two channel copy ,which I realize that I can play through my Dolby Surround rceiver, but it's not the same as Discrete channels.Edd Kerr , iegolden@shaw.ca"
1,A poor read and flawed history,"This book is somewhat entertaining, but it could've used an editor. Unfotunately, it not only lacks a great deal of facts, but it often gives the opposite. The author frequently falls into tired, false cliche about his opinions of the era, which often contradicts his more factual claims, and speaks about it's figures as if he had known then inside and out, and disliked them. The ridiculous Mark Twain-esque cliches he claims as facts are enough to drop the book, making it just another in the 100 year long pile of falsified, biased histories of the middle ages."
4,Fast Read,"This is a VERY fast read. As a lot of the other reviews have noted, Cantor leaves a lot out. Which is just fine. I don't think his intent was to write the definitive text of John of Gaunt and the era he lived in. That would have required several volumes and only serious academics would have been interested in it. Cantor is more interested in writing stuff that sells as opposed to writing the absolute best history on the market. A lot of good writers (Barbara Tuchman, Lord Norwich) do this and I don't have a problem with it. Historical studies will never reach a wider audience if books aren't written to engage the public. Call it popular history. While this book struggles at times to engage its audience, it's meant to be a very broad overview. The purpose was to show that Gaunt lived in at the end of an era and the beginning of a new era - it wasn't to explain in detail the socioeconomic, military-political realities of Western Europe during John of Gaunt's lifetime."
2,Interesting but irritating,"This history did not live up to expectations set by the fly leaf. Cantor rambles, contradicts himself and fails to support his points. He makes statements about Gaunt's emotional state and motivation which he does/can not substantiate. The editing was sub-par as well: at one point the word ""there"" should have been replaced by ""therefore"" in order for the sentence to make sense. I forced myself to finish the book, and found it interesting for the most part, but was overall irritated that the author of such a poorly written book could received such glowing reviews from ""The New Yorker"" and ""The Washington Post"" > did they read this?? I doubt it."
2,"Great for kids, but not serious history","I must agree with most of the commenters who found this book appaullingly bad. It's OK if you're dead tired and want something vaguely ""educational"" to fall asleep to. But, despite my sleepy state, I did quickly note an early error to which one commenter refers, and that is an error on the period in which chain maille was worn - a very short (less than 100 yrs.) period, but Cantor makes it sound like it was typically doned on a daily basis by all knights throughout most of the middle ages. So, right then, I knew there were going to be problems, if not simply gross generalities, throughout the book. It's basically useless ""history""."
1,Last Knight Review,"A very disapointing book. It is written at perhaps a middle-school level at best. Although that in itself would not be a negative if children were target audience.The author does not provide an indexed bibliography to bolster his too often broadly sweeping and generalized assertions. He wears his biases so openly as to be comical, and his choice of words, and emphasis is no less inflammatory, opinionated, and biased. This is especially so when he attempts to draw parallels between the modern world's ""capitalist American Billionaires' and the aristocracy of the middle ages. The author's worst offenses are his immaginary dialogues by historic figures. This book is a waste of money."
4,Great read,"Norman Cantor has written a very readable book about John Plantagent, Duke of Lancaster and one of the most important and influential men of the 14th century. Lancaster was later called of John of Gaunt reflecting his birth place of Ghent. Born the third son of Edward III and married to his distant heiress cousin Blanche, John became the wealthiest man in England and the 2nd duke of Lancaster.The era spanned by his lifetime (1340-1399) was a pivotal period influenced by the Hundred's Year War and the reoccuring Black Plague which decimated the British population and influenced the futures of serfdom and Catholicsm in England. The tall, handsome Lancaster would never be a king but his descendants through his three wives would become the Yorks, the Tudors, as well as the ruling families of Portugal and Spain."
3,Good introduction to upper class medieval life ...,"While the book isn't quite as bad as other reviewers or the Amazon star-rating indicate, it's not what the publisher advertises it to be - a book on chivalry and John of Gaunt. Threads of these themes appear throughout, but the book comprises random thoughts and insights about upper class medieval life, occasionally with comparisons to other centuries in Europe and the U.S. It reads like a series of classroom lectures in introductory medieval history.To that end, it has more value than earlier reviewers give it. If you are new to medieval history, this book is as good a place to start as any for information on the class structure, political and social attitudes, and economics of the times. It is not, however, an examination - even on an introductory level - of John of Gaunt. The author's attempt to interweave information about this important historical figure fails."
1,What a waste of money!,This is a very short book. The author uses very short sentences. Some have facts. Some have surmises. Some have allegations. Some are connected. Most are not. This is an amazing book. Amazingly bad. There is no flow. There is no theme. There is no apparent organization. How did this book get published?How do I get my money back?
3,A good stab,"An enjoyable read, using one of the most underrated characters of the middle ages as a lens into the time. While I don't always agree with Cantor's interpretations, he synthesizes the important bits for the lay reader. A very nice read, for those who want to spare many of the details and go straight to the big picture stuff."
4,Excellent choice,I love this bag. The pockets are conveniently located and large enough to accomodate all the stuff we hike along with us. The side cell phone pocket is where we keep spare pacifiers tucked and the net pocket at the end is great for keeping bottles handy for speed-grabbing. The only thing I would change with this bag is that the inside bottle pockets are not large enough for the larger Playtex disposable bottles - they only fit standard bottles and some of them are a tight squeeze). The bag doesn't have childish prints so we don't have to feel silly carrying it around.
2,nursemommyof2,I just had a baby boy 8 months ago. I loved the fact that I was able to buy a lot of Eddie Bower matching items for my son. We bought the diaper bag and it was awesome until 4 months down the line the hand strap broke off of the bag. I have since heard that this has happned to a lot of buyers of the bag. Sad to say the bag is great and I thought it was good quality until it broke and was unable to be fixed.I hate to think that Eddie Bower would allow this low quality bag to be a part of their high quality name.
3,Couldn't get past the smell!,I love everything about this bag except the moldy smell that comes from the changing pad. Anyone else experience this? I exchanged the first bag that was given to me at my baby shower after I opened the closet and the closet had taken on the mold smell. I tried airing it out. Replacement bag also had the same smell. I exchanged the bag last night for a different brand and noticed the other Eddie Bauer Diaper bags on the shelf had the same smell. Could be my pregnancy has made me too sensitive to the smell.
1,Zack's mom,"I bought this bag thinking that it was unisex enough for myself and my husband to use. I loved the changing pad and all the room inside. However, my son is only 4 months old now and the handle is beginning to rip. I tried to sew it back together but I can't get the needle through the thick material and velcro. I have read several reviews that rave about the bag.....I only wish I had one of theirs. I use this bag maybe twice a week and it's already falling apart. If you do decide on this bag, I hope you have better luck with it than I did."
2,Zipper broken,I registered for this bag and loved it when I received it. Much to my disappointment the zipper broke on the bag when my son was around 18 months old.
2,not a great bag,I bought this bag thinking that it would hold everything that Ineed to carry. Boy was I wrong. By the time I put his clothes and blanket in there was no room. also if you use the avent bottles you cant fit them in the bottle holders on the inside. If you keep the zipped bag in place you can hold even less. the only time I could use this bag was if I was going out for a short time. also the strap never stayed on my shoulder so it was very hard to juggel a baby abd the bag. I am still in search for a decent bag that holds enough for a whole day and then some.If you are thinking of buying this dont keep looking.
2,fell apart after 6 months,"The bag is roomy, well-thought out, but NOT durable. The top zipper broke after only 6 months, and then the next week, the plastic hardware holding the shoulder strap on broke off. I will not be buying an Eddie Bauer replacement."
2,Broke the first time we used it,The first overnight trip we took with our infant one of the plastic pieces that holds the shoulder strap on broke. On longer trips I have just packed my son's stuff in the same suitcase as mine and just taken the smaller day bag on the plane or in the car with me.
1,Not worth the money.,"You shouldn't need Eddie Bauer's name on the bag to make you feel secure that you are using the best diaper bag available. I recommend using a plastic bag from your local supermarket, it works just as well and best of all, it's free with purchase of any food item. Or just ask them for a bag and I'm sure they'll give you one. Plastic bags are easily replaced, whereas spending a fortune on another Eddie Bauer bag might put a dent in the weekly ""children expense"" budget."
2,Handle Ripped,"I liked this bag because it was masculine but the handle started ripping after about 2 months and finally broke after 4 months. We tried to sew it but that was pain. It is a nice bag with good features but be careful with the handles.Oh and the diaper pad being attached is nice idea in theory but when I use it in public restrooms on diaper changers there is not enough room for the bag on the changer. It gets top heavy and falls and could be dangerous with the baby on it. Plus it's a pretty short diaper pad. You're better off with a separate diaper pad. So overall, I would not recommend this exact item."
5,Even the dads will love it!,"This is a great diaper bag. It fits lots of essentials. I have about 10 diapers, a package of wipes, a bottle of water, formula packets,2 bottles, a receiving blanket, sleeper, 3 washcloths, a plastic bag, a bottle of infant's tylenol, and pacifiers and they all fit well. It is also more stylish and contemporary than something with little elephants.My husband likes it too, and has no problem carrying it.The strap is nice and thick and makes it comfortable to carry.No real complaints about it."
3,Too Small,"I purchased this with the birth of my daughter but returned it soon after. I have a 3 year old and 3 month old and purchased this to accommodate both of them, but found it was too small. I did not like that it was one big compartment separated by a flimsy divider attached with velcro. If you fill the bag, as I did, the divider never stays attached. I also did not like the attached changing pad. It made it impossible to change my daughter in cramped places like public restrooms. I like the look of the bag overall, but it was not functional."
3,Nice but attached changing pad annoying,"Love the bag for traveling but it would be nice if the changing pad unzipped completely from the bag. It is too hard to balance the bag at the end of an airport bathroom changing table and be able to change the baby on it at the same time. Would like the option of removing it completely. Otherwise, great bag, lots of pockets for holding small things (q-tips, creams, etc.) and the main compartment has plenty of room for clothing, diapers and various other things. Also has a clear zippered compartment for dirty/wet items."
2,Way too BULKY!,"This was the bag that I asked for in my registry so when I got it, I was thrilled. However, it soon became obvious this would not work for the day to day. It was way too bulky. My son is now 2 years old and I only use this when I travel. Needless to say I have only used it about 20 times. The pull out, but still attached, changig pad is nice but now that my son is older it gets a little awkward. The clear plastic pouch inside is very annoying also. I would have returned it but my husband thought we could keep it to travel so now that's all we use it for. It has become my son's carry on bag!"
3,too big,Don't use this bag for traveling on a plane. It's way too big and won't even fit underneath the seat in front of you. I returned it and am looking for something more functional.
1,Too heavy and bulky before anything is even put into it.,"Nice, understated colour. A good size on the outside. However, it is heavy and bulky before you even put anything into it. The changing pad is attached to the bag which is very awkward. There are not enough little compartments for small things. There are not enough little compartments on the outside of the bag for things like cloths that you need to grab quickly."
2,This bag is not useful/practical,"I bought the small and the large Eddie Bauer bags to match and the small one is great! This bag is like a regular duffle bag! It doesn't have any compartments inside for bottles so that shake around everywhere. Plus the diaper changer pad is connected to the bag, so you change your baby practically on the bag itself. If you have a larger baby forget using the changer pad. I like the Eddie Bauer products, but this one I was not impressed with. It is just not a diaper bag at all! Buy the small one with all the compartments!"
4,Diaper Bag...,I love this bag got it for a shower gift. However the handle is starting to rip. I know that I will not be able to sew it as the material is to thick. I will have to get another one when the handle completely rips off. My husband doesn't mind carrying this bag so we will get another one like this. THere is LOTS of room for all the baby items you will need to carry with you when you are away from home.
5,Perfect bag!,"This bag is wonderful for everyday use! Especially for working moms! I take this bag with us to the sitter everyday and just about everywhere else too. It has enough space to put his diapers, wipes, extra clothes, bibs, etc....I love it! It's so durable too. I'm super rough on things and this thing has taken a beating and kept on ticking. There is also a matching smaller bag for quick trips or extra things for longer trips."
1,Ripped in first 2 months,"I received this bag as a gift from my registry. I thought it would be pretty nice because it had lots of pockets. I have only been using it for 2 months now and the front pocket has already ripped at the seam. There is no way to repair it. I had small things in there (nail clippers, medicine, comb) and there is no reason for it come apart the way it did. And to top it off, the zipper is coming apart. I do not overstuff this bag and really expected a better quality than this."
2,dissapointed in quality & design,"We got this diaper bag so both my husband and I could use it. I thought it would be durable and easy to use. Within 3 months the pad on the shoulder strap had come off. One of the straps that held it on the shoulder strap got shredded by rubbing against the clasp on the side. Also, I don't like the feature of the 2 handles at the top of the bag getting velcroed together. When rushing to get something in the bag it is more challenging to get to the zipper and contents of the bag when you have to separate the velcroed handles. With a crying baby response time is critical.To be fair, I have to state the positive. It does not look like a diaper bag so it can pass as a briefcase and Dad won't lose his manliness carrying it. Also, the fold out changing pad is very convenient to use especially with the bathroom fold down changing tables."
5,Great for traveling:),This bag is very roomy. You can fit a ton of stuff in it plus it is very stylish. It is not to baby looking or clashy as most diaper bags are. I wouldn't recommend this bag for everyday use. A bit to big to lug around! I have the Eddie Bauer mini bag for everyday use and that bag works perfect too. You can fit quite a bit in it for how small it is. These are the best diaper bags I have ever owned:)
4,Nice,"This is a perfect diaper bag for moms/dads. It's a a bit too big for my taste, I guess cause my 2 week son is breastfed only and I don't need to pack a bunch of bottles. I'm sure I'll definitely fill the bag when he gets a little older. But overall I love the bag"
4,"not the best, but decent","If you like playing online with a headset or with a group and they all don't have a headset, just use the other connector and let them join in on the conversations. The sound quality isn't the best, but overall it is worth it."
1,The MX3228 covers flexes enough to break LCD screen,"I bought the MX3228 in May of 06 and found teh system to be advertised. In January 2007, I had the LCD screen crack. Iontacetd Gateway and explain it broke when I either opened or closed it, their position was It was user induced breakage or it broke because I used it.The damage was caused by the screen case flexing, not from my abuse. When you close or open eh screen the cover behind eh LCD screen will flex and eventually you will lose your LCD screen as well.I woudl give Gateway a score of less than 1 star. Perhaps -10 would be refelct their level of support."
1,Tool,"The tool took quite a while to arrive, and when it did it was the wrong size.We had to pay a local shop to install the part for us."
2,Went Flat After two Months!!!,"My title says it all. My 50 lbs boy had this for two months before it went flat! If you want this just as a decorative item, it looks OK, but if you buy it for a child plan on buying new filling along with it!"
4,Wonderful and Very detailed book!,This is very informative sewing book. Wonderful and detailed insrtuctions with step by step pictures. I like the book but I'm a novice sewer so it was a little overwhelming for me. But will be an asset when i get better at sewing. A great buy!
3,"More of a Sewing Workbook, not many patterns","The book itself is a very handy book, telling you things from different styles of stitching to different material. Off the top of my head, there only seemed to be about 20 patterns (many curtains and pillows, etc).. The book that I got contained older pictures and was just ... useless for the reason I bought it.I was hoping that it would have more patterns and creative ideas. It's really just a workbook for someone that needs to know how to begin sewing / and what to do or look for when starting.I'm disappointed because it's not what I was looking for (That's the only reason it got 3 stars). The book itself seems to be really handy if you need techniques to fix things, create curtains or chair pads, etc. I think I even seen a couch covers.It's just not for me :( Hope you enjoy this better than me!"
1,Poor Quality,"I purchased this item to replace the bad, squeaky hub bearing on my 2003 Ford Ranger 4x4. Within a 1,000 miles and a couple weeks, the new one I had purchased already went bad and squeaky. I purchased a Timken bearing because of their reputation for quality, but I was obviously mistaken. I won't be purchasing any other bearings from Timken in the future."
4,Heart warming and Heart-wrenching story,"Prague Counterpoint is the 2nd book (Vienna Prelude is first) in a series about musicians who lived in Europe during World War II. The characters are well developed, the historical details fit well into the story-line. I stayed up too late reading to find out ""what happens next""."
3,"Prague Counterpoint, kindle edition","As I started to read Prague Counterpoint, I was only expecting quality of the Thoene books. What I didn't expect was the art with which the Kindle Edition was able to damage the atmosphere of the book.What I mean is, that format of the chapters was weird, the first paragraph and then random paragraphs throughout the chapters had different font size, which was rather confusing. There were also many spelling mistakes in the text.What I get used to now is that not every book has a Table of Contents, but in this book, which has over 40 chapters it's almost necessity.Considering I paid $12.42 for it, I mark the material quality of this book 'very poor'.If you want to catch up with Thoene Zion Covenant Series, I recommend you to go for paper edition."
5,does not disappoint!,"This is turning into such a good series for history buff readers like me, who also enjoyChristian fiction. God has truly blessed the authors in their writing skill. Lookforward to reading the rest of the series!"
4,ABSOLUTELY DEVILISHLY GOOD!,"Just been a fan since ""DEVIL WOMAN"" but, Got this collection the other day and what a great voice CLIFF has.Of course ""DEVIL WOMAN"" is my fav.along with ""WE DON'T TALK ANYMORE"", ""DREAMIN"", ""A LITTLE IN LOVE"". and there are plenty more! This collection covers most of C.R.s Best! A 3 disc set of a world class singer."
2,Nice TV - until it died,"Enjoyed the TV for a couple of years, then reached the end of the warranty period. One day, it just turned itself off. Panasonic said to try a different electrical outlet. Got most of the picture back, but had a 3"" black bar down it. Panasonic sent a service rep out and $100 later we were told that the display board went bad. Tech claims that display boards are not replaced due to cost and Panasonic recommends we purchase a new TV. Tech and Panasonic both claim that display boards usually don't go out. Oh boy, for $1800 we get two years of TV. Looking for replacements from other makers now."
1,Don't buy this product!,"Good - The picture is fantastic.Bad - I had to have it repaired 32 days after I bought it. Good thing it was still under warranty. 18 months after I bought it and now out of warranty,it developed a thin black horizontal line all the way across the screen about 8"" up from the bottom. Cost to repair - $1600 !!!! This is more than I paid for it. Poor quality like this for a product that is this expensive is absolutely inexcusable."
4,WOW HDTV,"HD performance without HD subscription service is outstanding, some regular broadcast channels are below expectations, (not the set's fault)."
2,Very poor customer service and warrenty repairs,"My Pansonic Plasma unit arrived the first of April 2007. On the second day after it was turned on, horizontal lines started appearing across the screen. I contacted Panasonic. An authorizied service agent called and I repeated the problem. A week later they show up with two boards to replace. That did not solve the problem so they took the tv in for repairs. It is now the 7th of May 2007 and I still do not have my tv. They are now saying maybe sometime this week. The shop now has the part but cannot say when it will be ready and they can deliver the unit. They are replacing the complete panel. So, when I get it back, so much for a new tv. This will have taken a month to get resolved."
2,Don't buy!,"I bought this TV and within 2 years, I now have 4 thick black lines across the screen, and different points. As you can imagine, this completely ruins the experience, especially in scenes with lighter backgrounds. Tried contacting Panasonic, to no avail. And of course, it happened right after the warranty period expired. This was the third Panasonic tv I'd bought, but needless to say, will not be buying any more Panasonic Plasmas."
3,"The TV rocks, but Eagle is the WORST.","Ordered the TV on a Friday and it showed up to the local Eagle center on a Wednesday. Eagle called to schedule a delivery. Scheduled for a Monday - I sat around ALL day and they never showed up - didn't call either, I had to call them. Rescheduled for a Tuesday delivery, they showed up at the wrong time when I wasn't there. Again, I had to call to reschedule. They finally showed up Wednesday, on time, opened the TV up and it was shattered.Amazon had a great price, but I wasn't about to go through this ordeal a second time. Refused the delivery, ran up to Costco and got the EXACT same TV for 100 bucks more (plus tax) - but that includes a 90 day in-store return policy and an extended 2 year warranty (for free).Again, the TV is GREAT. Eagle is the worst and I won't be ordering anything delivered by them in the future."
4,Near Perfection,"I've now owned this tv for 14 months and have found it near perfect in every regard. The only ""let down,"" is that non-HD shows are not as good as they were on my non-HD tv. That said,I would not go back to my non-HD tv for any price.As mentioned by other reviewers here, the sports broadcast are particularly outstanding. Numerous visitors to my house have been blown away by the 50"" broadcast of college and NFL football games ... they're simply incredible to behold. I've simply not seen any other HD tv with a picture as rich and sharp as this Panasonic. I've heard the latest versions, with super black color capability, present a better picture, but their cost is 6-7 times what people are paying for this 50"" plasma ... and that speaks volumes about this Panasonic jewel."
4,Fantastic Plasma - Great Price!,"This TV rocks! Awesome picture....slick design. My only problem with it is that I wish it remembered the last Aspect Ratio that I had selected after I turn the TV off. It's a pain to have to scroll thru the list of different aspect ratios to get to a 16:9 ""Just"" picture so I can watch cable without the side bars every time I turn on the TV. Other than that...this thing kicks some serious boootaayy! Hi Def on this thing is so vivid it's sick! BTW - the delivery guys were great as well...they hung around while I plugged it in & made sure it worked before I signed for it. Very happy with this purchase!"
5,Small issues,"Just got this beauty and I love it. I am having a couple of small issues and need some advice. One thing is the ""Black Enhancement"" is grayed out on my menue so I can not adjust it. I was adjusting different things on the menue and wonder if it is something I did. Another thing is one of the settings is ""SD"" or ""HD""...mine is set on SD and it also is grayed out so I can not adjust that setting. Any advice or pointers that you can give me will be greatly appreciated."
1,garbage,"I have to return mine because it has a black hole type square in the left center of the screen. It also has a blemish in the bottom right corner. In the description it said minor damage to outer box, it didn't say there was any damage to the T.V. Trying to find someone to ship this large T.V. is difficult and expensive also. They say they will pay for the return shipping but I'm sure they'll make it difficult like everything else has been. I still have to pay for the packaging, which is about $140.00. I definitely do not recommend puchasing this T.V. This has been nothing but a headache and waste of money for me."
2,Pray it's Not Damaged!,"I received my lovely unit today, complete with a shattered screen. What do the kind Amazon ""customer service"" folks have to say? Uh,... well..., Uh... gee sorry man. It will be up to THREE WEEKS OR MORE FOR ME TO GET A REFUND. And, get this, I'm ""lucky because they do not have to refund me at all - according to the web site terms and conditions."" I spend 2400 clams and this is the response I get to receiving a completely trashed unit. My advice? Pay a couple hundred more and have peace of mind. Cause once you click ""complete purchase"" you are on your own baby."
1,Don't Buy Panasonic TVs,"Had TV for 3 years and each year the I had to have it repaired. The power button would blink 7 times and the screen would go black. Are you kidding me? $1,500 TV that can't even last a year without breaking! Now it's happened a 4th time and I've decided to cut my losses and trash the TV. Never Panasonic again!"
5,Awesome price and super-fast delivery,"This same TV is being sold at Costco for $[...]. I paid only $[....] from Amazon without any sales tax or delivery fee. Considering CA sales tax is at %8.25, my total price at Costco would been $[...]. I saved $[...]!But more amazing thing is that I received the item in less than a week in perfect condition. I placed my order on early Monday morning. I received the e-mail from Amazon on that same day that my item was shipped out! I live in San Jose, CA. I got a call from the local delivery agent, Eagle Global, on Friday afternoon to set up the 4 hour window on the Saturday. My TV was delivered on 1pm on Saturday. They delivered the TV to my living room and even offered to take the box away if I wanted.If this is not an amazing price or delivery, I don't know what is...."
1,Disappointed,"TV arrived broken. Shipper selected by Amazon did not seem very ""careful"" in handling the plasma tv. Amazon did not offer to replace the tv. After waiting several weeks for the delivery, it was quite disappointing to, not only receive damaged merchandise, but then to be told, ""oh well, if you want another tv, you have to order a new one; and wait two to three weeks for a credit for the one we shipped broken."" So I am floating over four thousand dollars for one two thosand dollar tv. Oh yea, they did offer to knock 20 bucks off express shipping which cost hundreds. Thanks."
5,amazing tv,"I'm not going to reinvent the wheel as many superlatives have already been written about this fine Panasonic.I will say that the one drawback is not related to the performance, but the fact that I elected to go it alone regarding the set up. The instructions are poorly written and I had to resort to going online to find most of the informatin I needed as far as the set up. I would suggest spending a few bucks and having the TV set up and mounted unless you are willing to spend some extra time figuring out how to complete the set up on your own.Otherwise, great picture, no issues with the shipment or delivery which was an initial concern about ordering online vs. going with a big box store pick up. I have no issues with the cooling fans with my unit though that does seem to be a complaint with some of these tv's. I love my tv and will likely purchase an additional 42 inch in the near future."
2,Tries too hard to be funny,"This video is disappointing. It tries too hard to be funny, and only ends up being annoying, because the points that the humor is trying to make are all pretty obvious. The time taken by the (rather juvenile) visual jokes would have been better spent in elaborating some of the more useful ideas that the program presents. Alternatively, the program could have been about half an hour shorter, which would have made it better focused.Not one of the SD's best efforts."
2,WHY BUY THIS???,"I give this two star, ONLY BECAUSE....and I mean this....WHY BUY THIS DVD SET WHEN THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON HAS THESE SAME EPISODES? I give the FIRST SEASON DVD SET about 10 stars, because I love watching Baretta. It brings back some great memories. Truly just ""one"" of the best shows from the seventies. So any fan of this show would know, why waste the money. I'm not sure why the companies do this. JUST PUT OUT THE OTHER SEASONS. Then we'll be happy."
5,Great Service,"Great, expedient service. My package was received in a timely fashion and it was in excellent condition. I would recommend this seller for purchasing DVDs."
4,A swingin' fun album,"This is a lot of fun to listen to. The songs have a sort of noir, swing feel, with catchy refrains and fingersnapping rhythms. The lyrics are a hoot--where else can you find songs about someone's ex-wife being ""thrown in the drink,"" or learning dance moves from a nurse? I especially like the fun takes on nursery rhymes, as in Charlie Takes the Cake--where the guy wants the ""baker man"" to bake him a cake of a woman in a ""curvaceous pan."" It's just a fun CD, great vocals, you can picture a smoky ballroom as Heather sings about the Bluebird Ballroom. I'm really looking forward to more of their stuff."
3,BE WARNED - THESE ARE NOT CHAIRS!!!!,"THE PHOTO IS REALLY MISLEADING!!! WHAT'S BEING SOLD HERE ARE THE CHAIR ARMS ONLY AND NOT THE FULL CHAIR DEPICTED IN THE PHOTO. ADMITTEDLY, IT WAS MY BAD - I WAS IN A HURRY WHEN I ORDERED AND DIDN'T READ THE DESCRIPTION - BUT THIS PHOTO IS REALLY, REALLY MISLEADING. ORDER THESE AND YOU'LL GET TWO PLASTIC CHAIR ARMS IN THE MAIL - NOTHING MORE!"
4,Love it but missing one.,I love this book so much I bought 4 for all my family. The only issue is that it is missing the Great Sand Dunes. They need to update.
5,"inspiring, emotional, heart warming, funny, motivational","Phils books, is warm and funny, written so anyone that has experienced life can relate. His ability to take the negatives in life and turn them into positives, is inspiring to anyone that thinks, life has dealt them a bad hand. Read it, and realize that you too, can clean the lense for which you view life."
2,read one and you've read them all,"I read one Victoria Holt book, and I quite liked it, so I found this one and read it. About half way through I realised that it was exactly the same as the first one I had read, mad a guess on who was the culprit and was correct, because this story was exactly the same as Pride of the Peacock. The trick is, think of all the people who could possible have a motive, eliminate them all and see who you are left with. Works every time, as I've since discovered. i found many VH books in the library in Germany, auf Deutsch of course. I read many of them, because I could concentrate on imprioving my language without having to think about the intricasies of a plot. Then again, you might love predictability, then this is right down your road."
4,"A little slow, but well worth it!",This is the second Victoria Holt book I have read and I must say that I enjoyed it very much. In my opinion it was a little slow at first but once I got about half way through the book I found it hard to put it down. And what an ending! So glad that I continued reading this book when I thought about giving up on it.
3,Training,"I got this doll to potty train my 2 years old daughter as it was advised by Dr. Phill show. As soon as you give the bottle to the doll, it starts leaking unlike the description says that the doll would let you know before it goes. It cries before actual peeing and my daughter got upset with the fact that baby cries. I don't think if it worth the price they are asking for."
4,Fun for Kiddo,"My 4 year old received the Baby Alive Wets N' Wiggles doll from her grandparents recently. Although my daughter loves it I'm finding it requires a lot of guidance and assistance. I'm sure she'll get the hang of it, as it's only been a week, but she has a difficult time getting the bottle in the correct position. If the bottle is not in the perfect spot, Baby Alive will not drink the bottle and will fuss. This frustrates my daughter.It is also difficult for little hands to put the new diapers on snugly so that it captures the pee properly. I end up being the one putting on the new diapers, which is constantly.One other thing. Watch out! If Baby Alive hasn't really peed yet, you're in for a soaking. My daughter thinks this is hysterical. She will spray her pee at you all at once. It shoots about 8 inches from her body. Amazing. And this is the girl model. I can't imagine how funny the boy model must be. LOL"
4,"A little messy, but fun!","My daughter loves this doll. We only have had it pee a few times, and when we did it was leaking after we changed the diaper. It wasn't a big deal, we just put another diaper on. It could get pricey if your child wanted it to pee all the time, though."
5,The Selfish Giant Changed My Life,"I was very small when I first saw The Selfish Giant, but it changed my life. I am now 38 years old, but continue to be impacted by the message of this movie. Please put this touching story back into circulation by making it VHS format. It is a ""Classic"" in the truest sense of the word!!!"
2,Not what I expected,"I have to temper my dissappointment with this CD with the fact that I thought this was an edgy-hard rock band. I bought this on a whim one day after hearing only about a half a song. It made the band sound like a good hard-rock style group.They are not.They are a bad semi-rock band that could pass for easy listening if it weren't for the fact that the lyrics are so painful.From the song revolving... ""If I was the sun, and you were the mother earth, I'd still be revolving around you."" Ouch.I don't understand how anyone rates them 5 stars. Even if I liked the style more, 3 stars would be tops for these guys. I don't think anyone really listened to this one more than twice.This from a fan of Disturbed, Linkin Park, and the likes. Take the source into account."
2,Is this the same Outspoken that used to play upbeat Post Hardcore?,This album is totally ready for mainstream radio. If it sells more than 20 actual units I will be pretty surprised.
3,BUY THESE IF YOU LIKE RUSTY HOOKS!,"These things are good for A SINGLE trip. If you go on the kayak and you're stuff gets a little wet, and you don't ahdn dry each hook you'll wake up and they will be rusty. Same with the hooks if you leave it on you're line.Other than that, they are sharp, hold bait well, hook sets nicely."
1,Worst children's book I've read yet,"Thank goodness I don't remember this book from my childhood! I'm so glad I read this book before I got a chance to share it with my 4 year old.It teaches some horrible lessons. Conformity at all costs. Corporal punishment. Animal cruelty. No matter how hard those ducks race to get on the boat, someone will always be last and will be hit with a stick.I realize this book is a classic and the illustrations are wonderful, but I think it is time to retire this one."
2,duck!,"This book is cleverly written, but I wouldn't read it to my children. Basically the premise is that this duck gets hit every day because he's the last on the boat. He gets tired of this and strikes out on his own but nearly gets eaten. Eventually he makes it back home where he gets hit again and he thinks that it's better to be safe back home, getting hit, than out there getting eaten.So, what this book is telling children is that it's better to be abused at home than to chance making your life better by, say, reporting your situation to the authorities. Because, what if they hurt you worse? Just go home and live with the abuse like a good little kid.And, that's a terrible message for a kid."
2,Not the book I remember!,"I made a long list of books I remembered from childhood when my son was born. He pulled this one off the shelf the other day, and though he moved on to another book more age-appropriate, I continued to read Ping to myself.Though the illustrations are lovely and the exploration of culture interesting, the portrayal of corporal punishment (especially for no offense, not that that should excuse it!) made me sick to my stomach. The ""moral"" of the story seems to imply that Ping should be grateful for his physical abuse, for at least he is safe from unknown abuses. This is not a message I want to pass on to my son.As we already own the book, I may keep it around to read to him when he is much much older, so that we can discuss how the message is wrong and that no one, including Ping, deserves to be hit. However, I would not recommend it to anyone."
5,It's About The Duck...Stupid!,"Get a life guys! It's a simple story with a warm ending. Tells your kids that even if they venture out into the world and make some bad choices or dumb mistakes, a loving family still welcomes them back with love and affection (have you looked at the last picture?). Your kids don't read more into it so why should you?This is my one of my daughter's favorite books. She's 23 now and will be reading it to her kids. It's one of those books that, in the end, makes a little child feel warm and safe...the way they should feel."
3,Not much charm,"This one doesn't do the trick at our house. All the ducks live on a boat -- they get out in the daytime and reboard in the evenings. The last duck up the gangplank gets spanked with a stick. Ping knows he will be last one day, and to avoid the spank, he hides. But he is lonely and frightened and cold, so he swims after the boat and finally catches up. He gets there right as all the ducks are coming back on the boat. He is resigned to being spanked with a stick as long as he can keep his familiar routine.We really don't care that much about the travails of this duck. Attention spans are short; go with a winner instead."
3,Love the story,"Although I love the story of Ping, I would have preferred a hardback addition. Since the paperback was my only option, and it was properly noted, I opted for this purchase. Unfortunately I know that the book will self destruct much faster than my preferred option."
5,Third Generation reading this wonderful story,"Timeless , charming book about a little duck ..lost and found. Our family is listening to this CD/book at the third generation level.Grandparents loved it as a children, then parents and finally..maybe NOT 'finally' grandson, as well."
2,What happened to the best review of all?,"There used to be a (hilarious) tounge-in-cheek review that made the comparison to the computer utility ""ping"".I went looking for it, and it is not posted here anymore! (One of the other reviews makes a passing reference to the ""comparison to operating systems"", so I know I'm in the right place.What happened to your sense of humor, Amazon????"
1,Do not buy this book.,"I understand that this book was written in the 1930's, so the level of cultural sensitivity with which it was written is nonexistent. In my opinion, this book only serves to perpetuate ridiculous stereotypes of Asian people, starting with the title. This book is outdated and borderline offensive."
1,Traumatized By the Duck,"As a child I loved picture books, Curious George, Mike Mulligan, even Winnie-the-Pooh which didn't have enough pictures. But how I dreaded the nights my parents would pull out Ping! It was kind of interesting at first, Chinese people, fishing on exotic looking boats, even the lanterns. But the ending with Ping running to escape a lashing with a switch... It still repulses me in my thirties. Somehow the whole story seemed violent and cruel. Very cruel. Give your kid something more pleasant to read."
5,A classic story from old China.,"This simple story of a curious duck has an easy moral lesson similar to ""there's no place like home."" It's really best when read aloud to children. I have a little yellow toy duck that quacks. I bring out the duck as I start the story and it immediately makes the story more focused for the kids. When I get to the part of the story where Ping gets caught by the boy, I turn on the duck's quacker, and the kids love it! This is the story they'll remember. One of my favorites."
4,An old fashioned children's story,The Story About Ping is a simple children's story from another era. It is not restricted by modern political correctness and has references to some aspects probably now frowned on. however it's naivete is part of it's charm. A nice 'feel good' story for toddlers and a touch of geography into the bargain. For parents who aren't afraid of realism.
4,Parenthood Revisited,"""The Story about Ping"" is straight out of the years I was reading beginners' books to my children (4 and 6 at the time). When my wife and I decided to look for a new born gift or two for our grandson I immediately turned to Amazon.It was a snap finding a half dozen titles of books we hope that our son's son will someday associate with his childhood.....and with his grandparents. Then we selected the two books that we would buy this time.I was pleased with the number of good to new quality copies available. The process of ordering two books only took a few moments. The pricing was acceptiable, even with shipping added on (this does, after all, save us gas and time in the mall). Within a week they were delivered. They arrived in very good condition. One of these has been sent off to its new owner (book plate and personal note in their places). This little reader will soon be well on his way to discovering the wondeful world of books.Thanks Amazon!"
1,Liberal Bias- DON'T READ.,"Ducks have always been known to have a liberal bias- they quack, which means that they, just like the Occupy clowns, want to be heard, but have no message. They also rely on entitlement programs and loyalties to eat, and expect big brother to bring them food everyday. Well, that's not true.In life you must work.This book makes it out like you can just live your whole life hugging trees and floating in rivers.Don't waste your time with this propaganda."
1,Nightmares!,"I had this book while growing up and I hated it! It gave me nightmares to the point where I couldn't even have it in the room with me. I am 29 now, with 5 children of my own and I still have nightmares about this book. I will never subject my children to this book. The cruelty and terror Ping must go thru is horrifying."
1,Boring and harsh,"The illustrations are plain and unappealing. The flow of the reading lags as well. My son never showed any interest in this book, and neither did I. Also, there are several references to beating ducks with a stick."
1,This book ruined my golf game.,"After reading this book, I caught a duck to use on the links. Despite naming it Ping, my distance and putting went down the toilet. I would not suggest using Ping for your average hacker."
3,Grosset & Dunlap edition is very cheaply made,Others have written regarding content; I am simply alerting people that this edition (ISBN 0448421658) was more cheaply made than I expected; the cover is simply folded over (no glue). I doubt it will hold up to much use.
4,Cute story,This was a cute story I enjoyed reading in elementary school. I hope my children will enjoy it as well when I share it with them.
3,A bit disturbing,"I'd have to agree with the reviewer, Gregg Hower, who said he found this book traumatic when it was read to him in his childhood. I haven't gone back and reread it as an adult, but I clearly remember being disturbed by it. It wasn't so much the occurrence of the swat on the duck's behind at the end of the book that bothered me, but rather the fact that he spent most of the book obsessing about it and trying to avoid it, which conveyed to me that being swatted was truly terrible. It was sort of like the situation of an abused child who runs away but ends up going back, because he has nowhere to run to. I realize that may all sound a little farfetched to people who enjoyed the book in their youth, but that was my reaction as a child and is the only reason I remember the book today. Obviously I wasn't scarred by it, but if you read this book to a child, I would strongly recommend discussing it with them afterwards to make sure they were not upset by it."
5,A wonderful children's book.,It is an enjoyable children's book of Ping the little yellow duck from a large duck family on a boat on the Yanktze River. Fast shipment and ready to enjoy with fun illustrations with story.
1,Concerned about messages around spanking,"I Recently read a copy of this to my son and was very concerned about the message around spanking: Ping doesn't want to be the last duck onto the boat because the last duck gets spanked with a stick. One day he's going to be the last duck, so he swims off by himself to avoid a spanking, but, then he's kind of lonely. In the end he decides to keep going on the boat because better to be with the master and other ducks, even if it means a spanking than to be off on his own. I am no prude, but I was bothered by the spanking, and even moreso by the fact that the spanking was delivered to the last duck for being LAST, not for any wrongdoing. There will always be a last duck, through no fault of that duck.I had fond memories of this book, but I will not read it to my son again."
1,It's about hitting a duck with a stick,I grew up with this book and am now in my 30s and unfortunately still have sad and angry memories about it. I can remember the story vividly as it was often read at our house and I always grieved at the end of the story when the duck is hit with a stick. The main character Ping is punished for wanting to explore the world and not conform. What a cruel message to purvey to our children. I find the story heartbreaking to this day.
5,Has been a favorite of mine for years!,"Although not offically a classic, this book should be. I have dozens of happy memoires of my mother reading this story to me over and over and over and over again. I would recomend to any child."
4,"History, People, Food","A wonderful compilation of stories of the Presidents and First Ladies, their times, and the food considered appropriate for executive guests. (My daughter, plauged with epilepsy, was touched the gentle treatment Mrs. McKinley was given in relation to her seizures.) A good choice for history buffs, cooks, and people intereted in a good read."
2,Decent material - VERY poor quality,"Skeletal Family never got the recognition they deserved in their time. I was really excited to find that this DVD was even available, as I never saw the band in concert. Although it does contain a good sampling of their music, and the live shows are cool to see, the quality is really bad. Sound and video both - sort of like an old VHS bootleg. If you're a die-hard fan, then this is definitely worth checking out - otherwise I'd probably skip it."
5,Brilliant and breathtaking!,"Gide's great novel is not easy to read. Its technique is extremely subtle and overwhelmingly complex. The novel is only partially ""plotted,"" but by this point in literary history, any reader who isn't prepared for this modernist playfulness shouldn't have picked up the novel in the first place. There is an extraordinary ebb and flow of language that at times explores characters directly and at times is highly oblique and suggestive. Perspectives are mixed; understandings (the narrator's, characters', and the readers') endlessly emerge, disappear, and return with great power. More than anything, this fabulous work carries the reader through an intricate, extraordinarily nuanced journey of a world of deceivers and deceived. The translation is a bit British for American readers, and it doens't always capture the very nuanced, elegant French Gide crafted so carefully. But don't miss this radiant, highly challenging novel."
5,Review of the Reviews,"I read ""The Counterfeiters"" twice many years ago, first in a college course on the psychological novel and just a few years later on my own. I was fascinated by its complexity, its intimate view of Paris of the time, and its use of the novel and diary entries within the novel. To say nothing of the wordplay and wonderful names: Passavant (pas savant), Profitendieu (profit en Dieu), the old piano teacher La Perouse (the name of a great Paris restaurant justly famous for many years), and of course, Strouvilou - if I had a French bulldog, I'd name him Strouvilou.The point of this entry, however, is to thank all the ***** reviewers. It was apleasure to read the results of such thoroughness, insight and genuine enjoyment."
4,A compelling read,"'The Attack' is a compelling read. You'll be hard-pressed to put it down. The story's protagonist - Dr. Amir Jaafari - goes through a terrifying series of traumas. We watch him literally fall apart before our eyes as he tries to maintain a hold on the story's narrative. To say anything more would be to reveal crucial plot details. The most fascinating parts of the story are the vivid, detail-laden accounts of life in locales like Bethlehem and Jenin."
4,Moving insight into complex environment,"Although the plot is largely predictable, the insights into Palestinian suffering (at a personal, day-to-day level) are striking. The book also gives subtle insight into the complex web of stakeholders involved in ""resistance"" and their modus operandi. Essential reading for anyone interested in the Israeli / Palestinian situation or indeed Islamic extremism."
3,the attack - y.khadra,the attackyasmina khadragood bookdeep analysiseasy readingwithout happy endingthe story from both sideswithout taking a sidetrying to be neutral
3,Great premise buried in workmanlike prose,"It's a great premise for a book. And the fact that it's being told from a man's perspective makes the premise even more intriguing: what would make this successful doctor's wife live a life of secrecy and, in the end, be willing to kill innocent civilians in the name of a political cause?Unfortunately, Khadra's workmanlike prose and heavy handed writing (sometimes almost laughable so that I found myself LONGING for a good editor), weighs too heavily and crushes the story.If you're looking for an excellent read on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, sadly, this is not the book. It isn't terrible; it just isn't terribly good."
5,Excellent!,"Just want to add my 5 stars to the rating. A truly masterful story of a person caught between the proverbial rock and a hard place.I am not going to say anything regarding the plot, others did it in details here, plus I don't want to spoil anything for people who have not read it yet."
2,The Attack,"Other than the main character, no one else was fleshed out in the book and so you don't care about them. Would have liked more background on the wife. I felt the author was bias toward the Palestian view in regard to the Mid East situation."
2,"Not exactly a failure, but a close call","First of all, this is not a balanced account, as you may conclude reading other reviews. Almost all Arabs are reasonable, sensitive, and nice. Almost all Jews are callous brutes. OK, maybe this is what the author really thinks, so I'll stop short of calling it dishonest. Still, lots of fantasy is going on there. If Israeli raze the suicide bomber's houses, why Dr. Jaafari's house was still standing last time we checked? Probably the author needed a setting for the dead martyr ghost's visit to her widower.The book fails to explain -- why did this lady kill 17 children? She seems to be intelligent enough to understand that's the surest way to prolong the occupation. Did I miss the explanation when I fell asleep?Did I mention the book is boring? Yawn.I was afraid Dr. Jaafari would become a ""martyr"" himself. Mercifully, the finale was different. That got the book the second star."
1,Disappointing,"I'm unclear as to why everyone is raving about this book. I found myself skipping paragraphs, dismayed by cliches in copy (he actually used ""avoided like the plague"") and character (the seemingly content woman who finds the need to make her life mean so much more).Make no mistake about it. While this book offers the pretense of providing deep insight into a complex situation (I hate the arrogance of this in any writer) and claims to show two sides of the troubles in Israel, it is extremely pro-Palestinian."
2,Disappointing,"I'm a long-time fan of John Ondrasik (aka ""Five for Fighting"") and have all of his albums. I attended one of his concerts many years ago and had a thoroughly wonderful time. I was expecting to relive that experience with this video. Unfortunately, that wasn't so. I understand that artists sometimes change up their songs a little in concert to give a slightly different ""feel"" to the song, but John strayed so far from the melody of some of his classic ""hits"" that I didn't even like them. Frankly, I enjoyed the more personal ""bits"" of the video than the songs themselves, and hearing the stories behind the songs. However, I already had that information from the ""Live"" CD, so I didn't really need to see it in a video. Save yourself some money and buy his studio CDs and see a live concert. But don't buy this video expecting it to wow you like his concerts do. Disappointing."
2,Sound quality is poor,Video quality is fair but very poor sound quality. Sounds like an 8 track tapeGiven the number of hits he (they) have it would be nice to have an SACD (audio) or Blu Ray version.
2,Towel ring on left side,"I am so disappointed in my Batali apron which has the ring on the left side. I am continually dropping water from my hands over to get to the towel, instead of just reaching down and getting to the towel.This apron has the towel ring in the proper place.But alas, I am stuck with the one with the ring on the side!Dee"
5,A superb album,The Laggan at their very best on this album sponsored by the Scottish Trades Union Congress. Arthur Johnstone's vocals are superb
3,nonstop commercials,"""World's Funniest & Cleverest Commercials"" is a good overview of the commercials created in the 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s. However, there are a few drawbacks. First, the commercials come one after the other with no stopping point if you want to examine one particular commercial. Also, it is sometimes not obvious where one commercial ends and the next begins. Second, the host is not terribly funny (in my opinion) and rather distracts from the show. Finally, it is already dated because today's commercials are so technologically superior to even the commercials of the 90s.I might recommend this to someone who wants a general overview of older commercials and doesn't need to look at each one individually."
1,Dissappointed,This is total crap. I need the 8th edition and you sent me this pile from 1971. Not going to work.
1,Minimal information,"This map is disappointing. It's a great idea to have it laminated and the size you can stow in a glove compartment, but it is sorely lacking in information. While the illustrations are enjoyable, I keep looking at all the space that could have held more information. Even though I could easily pack this map, it's staying home when I travel down route 66."
2,Not very good.,Better suited to place on the wall as a display than to use as a map. If you are looking for detail you won't find it here.
3,Route 66,The map is OK. I thought coming from the AAA that the road map would be more precise showing realignments etc. If you're looking for good places to eat or tourist traps or places of interest this map is adequate.
4,Chipper solo piano,"Bud Powell and Charlie Parker made some of the most amazing 50's jazz together. One concert produced the famous ""Jazz At Massey Hall"" album. Parker passed away in 1955, and Bud Powell was by then considered to be past his prime, due to mental health problems. This 1958 shows that Bud Powell could still play very well. This CD has 14 Charlie Parker songs and ""Salt Peanuts"" by Dizzy Gillespie near the end. The songs are taken at a pretty fast pace, and luckily Powell had a good rhythm section to help. George Duvivier on bass and Art Taylor on drums keep things interesting and fill in any spots Powell lays out. Most of the songs have good melodies, and Powell doesn't overstay any of their welcomes. If any of this interests you, you should get it."
4,One Great Master Playing Another,"No one knew Charlie Parker's work much better than Bud, especially on the piano. The smile on Bud's face on the cover of this album is symbolic of the way it will make you feel. He injects the same energy into Bird's pieces as Bird himself. The swingin' tunes are so deftly produced from Bud's hands that you wonder if Charlie is standing over him directing his every thought. Bird and Bud fans alike will love this, as well as any jazz lover."
2,"""Diary"": Another re-write of Mark Lewisohn's research","Miles joins the ranks of such copy-cat authors as Mark Hertsgaard with his ""Diary"". This book is far from being ""an astonishingly detailed chronology of gigs, venues, quotes, and memorable facts about the world's most famous band"". Miles has simply taken the contents of Mark Lewisohn's extensively researched ""Chronicle"" and added pictures.Aside from being a great-looking ""coffee table"" book, it is hardly worth the price. The book contains no great revelations, nor does it have any details that have not been covered ad nauseum in the any of the hundreds of books already written about the Beatles.If you can live without the big pictures, I strongly suggest locating a copy of any of Lewisohn's books.- Paul, NYC"
5,A must for Beatle fans!!,This book was worth it's price because the author included a photo that I have never seen in any Beatle's related publication. The photo shows John Lennon and George Harrison leaving a home with what appears to be Elvis Presly standing at the doorway. The Beatles met Elvis at his home in Los angeles in 1965 and the author placed this photo alongside his description of this event. Unfortunately there is no caption alongside the photo. This was their only encounter and no photographs were taken of this historic meeting. The author did not elaborate on this photo and appears to have left it to the imagination of the reader. It would be great if the author cleared this matter up.
2,"So far, not worth it","On page one, I already found 5 mistakes (not typos, actual factual errors!) Plus, the printing is so small you about need a magnifying glass to read it!"
4,Easy to dance to,"I had heard the song ""Cupid Shuffle"" at a dance and loved it, so I bought the CD. There are several other nice songs included, some slower, some to dance to. I was happy with the music overall."
5,An underappreciated classic.,"Johnny Winter applied his deft touch to this outstanding recording with Sonny Terry and Willie Dixon. As with the four brilliant Blues Sky recordings he produced for Muddy Waters this set is a killer. Winter's playing is always at it's best when he is in the presence of a Blues Master. He is more restrained and supportive, less invested in overwhelming the music as he is in supporting the artist. Sonny is in top form. It's hard to imagine he was near the end of the road at the time of this effort. His was a remarkably vital and inspired performance. This is a modern-era classic of the blues, at a time that the blues was gasping it's last authentic breath. Essential...Simon"
3,NOT SONNY'S BEST EFFORT.,"SONNY TERRY IS A COUNTRY BLUES HARMONICA PLAYER WHOSE TRADEMARK ""WHOOPIN"" RECALLS A LATE NIGHT HOE-DOWN. TERRY HAS PERFORMED SOLO AS WELL AS WITH MANY OF THE GREATS INCLUDING LEADBELLY, LIGHTNIN' HOPKINS, BIG JOE WILLIAMS, AND WOODIE GUTHERIE.WITH RESPECT TO THIS CD, TERRY IS JOINED BY JOHNNY WINTER WHO PRODUCES AND PLAYS SLIDE GUITAR AND PIANO, THE GREAT WILLIE DIXON ON BASS AND STYVE HOMNICK ON DRUMS. THE END RESULT IS A DELTA STYLE BLUES CD WHICH KEEPS THE ""WHOOPIN"" TO A MINIMUM.WHILE THERE ARE SOME STANDOUTS ON THIS CD SUCH AS ""I GOT MY EYES ON YOU"" AND ""BURNT CHILD"", THIS IS NOT TERRY'S BEST WORK. PRIOR TO RECOMMENDING THIS CD, I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU LOOK INTO TERRY'S ""WHOOPIN' THE BLUES: THE CAPITOL RECORDINGS 1947-50"" OR ""BROWNIE MCGHEE AND SONNY TERRY SING"". EITHER OR BOTH CD'S WILL GIVE YOU A BETTER SENSE OF THIS MAN IN HIS HEYDAY."
4,Great educational book,"I actually work in Central Sterile Processing. I found this book very useful with the information of surgical procedures, anotomy charts , surgical instruments. Plus it is very clear on its format, easy to understand and follow. This book will answer many questions that students going for surgical technology need or simple just like me, a person who works with surgical instruments on the daily basis."
1,Don't spend the money,"This text is horable, there is info that is wrong. I am ST student . I would buy Alexdars it's the best book around."
2,Boring!,"If you're the type that likes to take long car rides and look out the window, or sit for hours and watch the grass grow, then this DVD is for you. The background music is OK, and the 3D is passable (though present on only half of the scenes). However, the scenes are boringly repetitious. I was hoping for something visually stimulating, similar to the video/music montage seen in the suicide room at the end of the movie Soylent Green. Instead you get monotonous scenes like the same school of fish swimming by the screen for 10 minutes (as a continuous video loop), or the view from a train or car window as the houses and telephone poles pass you by (literally, the camera was just pointed out the window of a car and a train for 12 mins each). Arrogant and obnoxious comments like Zaslof's above aside, some may find this relaxing, but I think most would find this dull. Update: I now see it's been discontinued... gee, I wonder why :-)."
3,"Dragging, dragging, dragging . . .","Michael Phillips is one of my favorite authors, but he usually always gets too wordy in his novels. This one is no exception. There are a few places in the book, though, that kept me reading, hoping that I would actually find out the well-kept secret. I would think that secret would have been revealed in this book of the trilogy. The lessons learned are quite good, though, but the explanation is often monotonous, repetitive, and boring. As I start the second book in this series, it picks up quite a bit. It even fills you in on everything that happened in the first. Wish I would have started on the second! Anyways, be warned that the book is a hard to get into, but the Christian values and attitudes are wonderful!"
4,I liked this book very much.,"Mr. Phillips writes very interesting descriptions of the time period and the country. I find his characters very real and identified with the mother and father in their efforts to raise their children and teach them their values. I especially liked the prayers he included. I am not very articulate and so I appreciate finding prayers that express my feelings, and address issues that I am dealing with. I think this is a very ""gentle"" book and am looking forward to reading the next in the series."
5,Terrific Book!,This book is wonderful! Not only does it capture the true flavour of the times (the Technological Revolution in England) but it gives you a whole host of characters to learn about and love. The story of how Charles and Jocelyn Rutherford discover Christianity will inspire you. Make sure you read every book in this series!
5,Such a GREAT book!!!!!,"An excellent book!!!!!! A definite ""get!!!!"" I really liked it because it seemed to be like what my own family is going through!!! Phillips did such a wonderful job at writing this novel!!! I am looking forward to a second book!!!!!!"
3,Book was OK . You'll need to read all 4 in the series,"I have two times during the year that I can actually pick up a book and read it from cover to cover. During that time I usually read 4 to 5 books. I took #1 and #2 of this series on vacation with me. I was very dissappointed to find that there is no conclusion to the ""secret"". I will have to wait till next year to read #3 and #4 of this series. I am very frustrated about this and will not be reading this author again."
4,Good product,So far so good. Product was shipped and delivered as described!If you need this product it is a good option.
3,The Life Power and How to Use It by Towne,"Not a book I would buy, but sent as a gift to a friend who is sole searching in understanding the power with in!"
4,The Tai Chi Book: Clear directions,"I teach a philosophy of Mind and Body course and my students will use this as the text for the Tai Chi class they must take as a co-requisite for my philosophy course. The author, a Ph.D. in physics, offers clear examples of what Tai Chi looks like but wisely refraines from trying to teach a full course in Tai Chi. He offers a sustained discussion of the philosophy behind Tai Chi, what it is and what it is not. It is not exciting reading but purposeful and organized. It will prove helpful for my students and anyone wishing an introduction to Tai Chi."
5,Blackly humorous mystery,Any of you readers who love a good British mystery and like black humor should read this book--it's clever and hilarious. The author's Philip Fletcher mysteries are priceless too.
3,A MUST HAVE FOR STEVIE RAY VAUGHAN FANATICS.,"""STRIKE THE LIGHTNING"" IS A STRONG ALBUM PUT TOGETHER BY LONNIE MACK AND STEVIE RAY VAUGHAN. MACK AND VAUGHAN SHOWCASE THEIR DIFFERENT BLUES-BASED GUITAR STYLES IN SEVERAL OF THE TRACKS. IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THIS CD JUST FOR THE SAKE OF ADDING TO YOUR S.R.V. COLLECTION, BY ALL MEANS GO AND GET IT! ON THE OTHER HAND, IF YOU EXPECT TO GET THE USUAL S.R.V. MIND BLOWING GUITAR WORK, YOU HAD BETTER LOOK ELSEWHERE. STEVIE IS NOT A MAJOR PART OF THE SONGWRITING OR LEAD GUITAR SOLOS... LONNIE MACK IS A PLEASANT SURPRISE TO THOSE WHO ARE HEARING HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME ON THIS CD."
3,Not bad,"It is not bad, but it is not the best either. A little too spicy for me and being parmesan flavor I did not really expect that. It is definitely convenient for office lunches, but you must let it stand MUCH longer than the directions indicate."
4,This is a perfect thing tokeepin your office.,"This product is pretty good. When I forget to bring my lunch to work this is a good solution to have. The spice in the soup has a really good flavor, and to me this is more of a pasta dish than a soup. I would order this again, but it is not a must have for me."
3,Too much spice for me,"I received this and the black bean with rice. Both are too spicy for me, so I won't be ordering again. Since they came in a case, I will have to find some way to use them as a condiment and incorporate them into a dish."
4,A Discovery,"What a treat to discover and read this book after being a fan of Tarantino's ""Jackie Brown"". I came away with new respect for both the author and the film-maker."
3,Only for the non-discriminating reader,"Alright, so the dialogue is funny. And I have no doubt this how gangsters, crooks, and cops talk in real life. But if you're the type who insists on a good story line that actually goes somewhere, or a main character that you can sympathize with you aren't going to find it here."
3,Temper Your Expectations,"While this book was certainly enjoyable, it was not the incredible tour-de-force crime novel many other reviews had set me up to expect. I found many of the characters to be bland and virtually indistinguishable from other characters. Yes, I know it is supposed to be representative of a specific time and place (one with which I am not entirely unfamiliar), but apart from the description of a hockey game and some street names, none of the flavor of the area was successfully conveyed.It was a mildly entertaining quick read, one I would have likely enjoyed more had my expectations not been raised so high. It was certainly better than much of what passes for crime writing these days."
4,Very realistic. Natural (movie),I have not read the book but just saw the movie starring Robert Mitchum. I was spellbound by the realism without an over abundance of bad language. Yes there is cussing but not like the modern day filth.Mitchum was the star but he was just one of the characters in this movie. His wife was not a glamour queen. Surprise ending to a movie that developed characters and realism of the underworld.
2,incredibly accurate but uninvolving,"The story is told from such a lofty perspective that you never care about what is happening. Even the worst hood has some sense of importance and urgency to their lives. But Coyle and company are just presented here as vermin under a microscope.As for the vaunted accuracy of the dialogue, I believe this book does fall down a bit. It shows that there is very little variation between the club-tongued lower class dialect of Boston and Brooklynese. As a lifelong resident of the Boston area, I believe this is inaccurate. The only person I know of that has successfully captured the Boston dialect in the media is John Ratzenberger playing the Cliff Clavin character in the TV programm ""Cheers""."
3,Boston crime novel,"I read this book because Dennis Lehane is a fan of George V. Higgins. It was a short novel about the Boston crime scene. Had some interesting parts. Lehane's dialog is more clever than Higgins's, though."
5,An unusual plot of criminal activity,It is a classic formula and well written. What else can I say? I was surprised at the ending even though in retrospect it was obvious.
4,Great Dialog,"I read that this book inspired Elmore Leonard to begin writing crime fiction. The dialog in Higgins's novel was really well done and I really enjoyed that part of it. I thought the plot was somewhat staid. It's possible that the novel was written too long ago and the illegal gun sales and bank robberies therein don't seem so real today. Nonetheless, it was a fun read for the dialog that gave the reader just the hint of the characters' motivations. Higgins has an excellent ear.@WixSimon"
2,"Okay, but not good enough","this is an okay CD, but it doesn't show enough of tyner's good work. I would recommend that you get his quartet's new york reunion album instead (that is one of my favorite CD's)"
1,HORRIBLE,"I have read several of the books in the Calder series, some of which I have kept in my personal collection, but not this one! I thought the love between the hero and the heroine was pathetic. At first this book had real potential. But Benteen had no concern for Lorna's feelings. I hated the fact that he raped her just because she threathen to leave him. As the story goes on, it is very obvious that Lorna is unhappy with her life and I begin to dislike Benteen. I don't see a love there. A bad read! Stay Away"
5,This Calder range,Great read. Not too graphic and the depiction of the land was breathtaking. Lorna was a sweet heroine. Loved it
5,comment about product,"Have recieved your product in better than listed condition, it arrived in record time with many thanks as this is one of the ""hard"" to find books that is to compete my Clader series which I have looked for over the years. I must confess, I had not started the series due to the dislike of starting one only to find I don't have the whole series and once my co-worker set me on to this way of finding them, we are all going to benefit as we pass our books around. Thank you for your prompt and great service."
4,Awesome collection,"While still lacking ""something"" this is by far the best teen collection I've looked at. Tons of great ideas."
4,The Journaling Sells it!,"This book has neat ideas in it, but the pages are a little too cluttered for me. But what is fantastic about this book are the journaling ideas! They will definitely pull at your heartstrings."
3,Fair,"The glove is decent, but the package says it doesn't protect hands from serrated knives. And guess what? It doesn't! Not bad otherwise, though. Just run it through the dishwasher and it is clean."
5,Practical advice that works,"Alison's book just WORKS - it is full of really practical advice from a many-times published author who has been there, done that. She knows how the publishing industry works - I believe she's a University lecturer on the subject, too, so she knows what she's talking about - and how to make it work for you. And as a bonus she's an exceptionally clear writer. I guess if you're reading this you're interested in finding a great book on how to market books. Well, you've just found it!"
3,Actually 3.5...not enough steam for me!!!,"There was a lot to like about this novel. The characters were richly drawn, the plot was interesting, and there were interesting sub-characters. This author is obviously very talented. What kept me from giving a higher rating were two things: 1) I hate romance novels were the main characters do and say vicious, cruel things to each other. I can never understand how, if they love each other, they can behave that way in the first place, or how any relationship can ever survive such cruelty; 2) the sex scenes were disappointingly bland. I felt like the author did such a good job of describing Hadrian's increasing lust for Nicole, but when they finally made love, the scenes were very short and not very descriptive. In spite of those two things, however, I really enjoyed this novel and look forward to reading more by this author."
2,Spoiled Brat means lousy Heroine,"Nicole Shelton the eldest daughter of Nicholas Shelton is the heroine for this story. But for a maiden of 23 she is spoiled and sullen and she has not one redeeming grace for her personality. At first she longs and desires for Hadrian-Braxton Lowell the Duke of Clayborough, then when circumstances finally allows for them to marry, she goes through one big long sulk worthy of a 5 year old all because of built up insecurities and petty jealousies and imaginations and mostly because of her pride. She didn't deserve the Duke and he really should have thrown her over for another since she was so adamant that she didn't want to marry him. Sulky spoiled childish heroines are just not appealing. Yet they persist in making this personality type the dominant one in many romance novels. Because of the unlikable heroine, I rate this novel 2 stars. Lindsay could have done better."
5,Scandalous Love a good buy,"I almost didn't get this book and wasn't too enthusiastic when I received it, but I am so glad that I did! I was a little hesitant due to the some of the previous reviews for this book. I don't really like my romance novels to have too many storylines going all at once, and was worried that the story behind Hadrian's mother's past would be uninteresting, but I was pleasantly surprised on how well it was worked into the story. There were some flashbacks, but it still tied into the present storyline. I couldn't put this book down and finished it in one day. It's definitely worth a try. And I will be looking into getting more of Joyce's books."
1,Boring,"I don't think this book is good at all. It's kinda boring. It seems to me that Mrs. Joyce wanted to tie the 2 families (Bragg and de Warrens) together.First of all, I think the heroine, Nicole is a spoilt brat and kinda selfish. I don't have anything to say about the hero since he doesn't seem to try very hard to get the girl at all. She just landed in his lap and his life.This book is not a keeper. Do not waste your time to read this. If you want a great read, you should try Brenda Joyce's The Masquerade. The plot and the chemistry between the hero and heroine is much more stronger."
3,Why!!!!,"I really liked the character's, don't get me wrong. It's just that I clearly saw Elizabeth (Hadrian's fiance`) was going to die just so Nicole and Hadrian can get together, how obvious. It was awfully sad, though honor bound, that Hadrian marries Nicole when Elizabeth's not even ""cold in her grave"" (That sorta put some distaste in my mouth especially when Brenda Joyce went that far in character with Elizbeth). I thought that Hadrian kept repeating himself though. It's like I'm the Duke, I'm the Duke, I'm the Duke, and all you want to say is ""Alright already, you are the Duke!"" This book was alright though. I liked the display of his lordship's influence and I have to admitt, Brenda Joyce busted out some pretty good lines along the way. I have to say that in some parts of this book, Hadrian always seems to think ""No"" is ""Yes"""
1,TOTALLY SUCK !,THIS TOTALLY SUCK ! DON'T BUY THIS!! HE IS STEALING YOUR MONEY!! THAT BOOK DOESN'T BRING ANYTHING WORTHFULL! NEVER BUY THIS! NEVER!!!!!!!!!!!DON'T PUT ANY MORE MONEY IN HIS POCKET ! KEEP IT FOR YOURSELF!-----An advised buyer-----
2,Settle for the Original,"I recently purchased this Symphonic Rock tribute, along with one they did for The Alan Parsons Project. While their mimicry of Mr. Parsons' music comes off well and respectful, their handling of the more complex tunes of Supertramp is mundane at the least. The accents are worse on this one than the APP tribute, and the mixing/arrangements are sparse and barren. Only the later hits of Supertramp---""Goodbye Stranger"", ""Take the Long Way Home,"" ""The Logical Song,"" and ""Breakfast in America"" come across marginally effective. In trying to ""Sound"" like Supertramp, they come off as an amateur Top 40 band, covering their tunes, and not covering them all that well. Unlike their APP tribute, which they merely tried to suggest the same vocal feel, they go for the all out vocal stylings of Hodgson and fall flat on their face. It's more a mockery than a tribute. Not an awful CD, but not one you'd want to recommend too strongly to friends."
3,living burial,"The first attempt for a living burial to Supertramp failed five years after with the edition of a new original album 'Some things never change'. The intention of doing a songbook of this universal band will be not so bad when more time has passed. The resolution of the songs is done with fidelity, but vocals don't pass the test. I am interested in this kind of arrangements and I know that recently there are done someones with better intentions, only available for u.s. costumers, it's a pity for me, european, and so, I still have some hope in a new original album of my favorite band."
1,Piece of You Know What,"I guess I need to be honest and admit right from the start that I never was a big fan of the band. I had purchased their ""Acquainted With The Night"" cd when it came out and there are a few songs on that one that I liked, so I figured what better cd to check out than their ""Best of"" cd. Well I was wrong about that. Four out of the fourteen tracks are previously unreleased material, and I didn't care for any of them. Now I don't know about you, but when I buy a ""Best of"", I expect just that - songs that were the most popular."
3,Too General,"I found the suggestions in the book to be too general, not specific enough. Perhaps they work better if you are already more of a musician. I was hoping for more specific ideas for musical games and activities to do with the children, rather than general suggestions about improvising with them."
5,Great Resource,"I have been a piano teacher for over 30 years--all ages and levels. Kia and Karen's book is a delight! It is full of wonderful ways to stimulate children's creativity. I love seeing my students' eyes light up when I show them one of Kia's ""riffs."" In addition to being a terrific parent's guide, it is a great resource for any teacher to have on hand."
2,poor quality,I am very dissapointed in this remote.I had a zenith remote that lasted 6 years.When it died I wanted another Zenith. Well this can't compair to the old one.You can tell just by holding it that it is cheaply made.Some times the buttons don't work.I would never buy another zenith.
5,The last Dogfight,"Great book, I read this book 1n 1979 & again in 2012. I have a copy for My personal library. If you like ww II aerial history this is a must read"
2,Carex Alluminum Cane adjustable with rounded handle,"Having used this brand of Cane for several years, I was disappointed to see that the latest rendition is much less sturdy, since the metal now has smaller circumference and doesn't feel the same gauge. Gives feeling of being more fragile and less supportive.Also, the securing 'plastic washer' (used to lock the setting after adjusting the height) cracks more easily than in older models.To keep costs down the manufactured product quality has significantly diminished in my opinion."
2,For syfy freaks only,This book is quite complicated and tedious. Not for the faint at heart. The first half of the book was excellent and very interesting. From there it became a chore to figure out. It might need to be read numerous times to actually figure it out but why would you?
3,Didn't move me,"I'm not sure why I didn't really like this. It had an interesting premise (Fall, rise, fall of human civilization) but it failed to grip me. It was somewhat difficult to read and relied too heavily on religious doctrine."
4,Grim reminder for all Nuclear Mad countries,I bought this book off a pavement shop. It was tattered. Still I acquired it as I have read praises about this work. I was not disappointed. Searing piece of fiction.Every nation's leaders should read this novel and bury nuclear madness forever.
1,I keep trying but I can never get past chapter 1,Its just hard. There is definitely nothing that is gripping me. Ok I did get past chapter 1 but nit far. I think I had gotten 50 or so pages in before announcing the futility. The concept sounds great but there is difficulty getting through the pages and pages of stagnancy.
1,Huge disappointment!,"I bought this book with high expectations--after all, it has been highly recommended as a classic of science fiction. I couldn't finish it. The lack of women characters made it impossible for me to relate to the story. It may be a good book, but with so many other thoughtful science fiction books out there that more realistically include women, why bother?"
4,If only I'd been looking for commentary and not story!,"An excellent book, to be sure, and a distant future that leaves one somewhat discouraged and terrified, and an interesting glimpse into the workings of a church in isolation, if not exile. But nevertheless a disappointment. It was recommended to me very highly, and it just never got to that high point. Nothing really happened. There didn't seem to be any message, any purpose, any great design. But I do love this, from page 265: ""When the world was in darkness and wretchedness, it could believe in perfection and yearn for it. But when the world became bright with reason and riches, it began to sense the narrowness of the needle's eye, and that rankled for a world no longer willing to believe or yearn."" I suppose that's enough of a comment on religion for any one novel to hope to accomplish."
3,Slight Disappoinment,"I recently read this book for my english class. After hearing all my friends, who had already completed the course, rave about how good this novel was, I was disappointed in the novel. I believe it is well written, but that it is not for everyone. It's shocking reality appealed to me, but I found the religion content to be a bit much. I believe, I could recommend this novel for the quality of the writing, but I myself will never pick it up again."
5,Top Sci-fi Books ever written,"Easily one of the top sci-fi stories written. This is a classic. It fills in so many gaps that are present in mainstream science fiction novels. There is indeed room for faith amongst the development of a possible future for the world. The connection between past, present, and future along with the circular nature of our fate works so well in this novel. I will never forget even the minor plot character such as Lazarus."
5,Science Fiction With Heart and Mind,"Now that it seems most science fiction authors are mainly interested in writing 800-page books (and usually as part of a series of books), ""A Canticle For Leibowitz"" is that less common form of the genre: a meditation on humanity, science, and character. If you are more interested in story than in overly-detailed pseudo-scientific, engineering-manuals-disguised-as-novels, then this a book worth reading. I read it as a boy, and re-read it 15 years later, and was still deeply moved. Very few of the hundreds of science fiction novels I've read remain with me. This is one I treasure."
4,Excellent,Great book! I was assigned this book for a class on Medeival and Modern Apocalypticism. A classic in apocalyptic literature. Definitely a re-readable book.
3,a frustrating read,"Frustrating because the author painted some great scenes that I will always remember, but I hated wading through all the psychobabble and religious claptrap."
2,School book,"Strange. Very strange. My son had to read it for his AP English class, he asked me to read it with him....ugh, I see why....hard to get."
2,I just don't see it,"I am still wondering what is considered so good about this book. I feel fairly well versed in SF and this one ranks as low as the last few books in the Dune series. There were interesting flashes in the book. The idea of technology being held by the church was fairly interesting, but never panned out for me. Thon Taddeo's visit had my interest, but lost it because nothing that interesting transpired. One thing I will concede, the literary level was high for SF (no, I am not just saying that because the book contains Latin). I hope that you are enjoying, enjoyed or will enjoy it more than I did."

3,Dated,"This book holds some interesting points and ideas on religion and society, but mostly it shows how easily it is to write a book that can become very dated.The ideas may have been provocative and inspiring when the book was released, but these day it read kind of stale and boring. When the idea in an idea book, gets outdated, there's not much left."
1,JUST AWFUL,"I read about 1 book a week and this was the biggest waste of that week in a LONG time. I kept at it thinking it would get better but even the ending was garbage. Slow and boring as heck and whats with all the latin? Am I really expected to know the latin? And the ONLY interesting character, the old man, the writer never really brings to resolution or conclusion. I never write these reviews but this book was so ridiculously bad I thought I might save just 1 person the horror of reading it."
5,Thoughtful and applicable.,"This my second favorite book, the first being Hofstadter's _Godel, Escher, Bach_. It's incredible. What I particularly like about it is that it never stops being profound-- ending the chapters with the ubiquitous buzzards, the assisted-suicide debate in the end, and other devices. Read it."
5,This book is a classic,"Many years ago, I picked up a dog-eared copy of this book in a local second-hand store. Since then, I've read it every couple of years, and it remains one of the true classics of this genre. For anyone who hasn't read this book: Stop what you are doing and RUN to the nearest bookstore."
5,Good Book; but don't read it expecting a happy ending,"This book is excellent. Just a bit weird. A Canticle for Leibowitz is intended to show that Humanity may be able to rise from its mistakes (a nuclear war), but repeat the exact same mistake. In other words, Humanity goes boom. Twice. Before the beginning of the book (Fiat Homo), and in the end (Fiat Voluntas Tua).One other reason that made me find this book was the fact that it teaches you about the process involved in canonizing someone."
4,Seems like an inspiration for Battlestar Galactica,"Many good reviews here explain the book well enough. I'll only add that it seems clear that this book was one of the inspirations for the recent Battlestar Galactica reboot.Quickly, though, the book was very good. Miller was clearly a talented writer and the message he conveys is engaging and thought-provoking. Certainly deserves its lofty place in American Literature."
3,A Canticle for Leibowitz,"I thought the book raised some good points. One, that humans are sinful creatures. Miller points out that man sees his mistakes from history but tends to repeat them. Towards the end of the book, man starts another nuclear war despite knowledge of the effects of the first one. Another interesting point was to see how the Catholic Church preserved itself throughout the hundreds of years that the book takes place. The church even sent clergy to space. I would recommend the book if you like SF. It is unique in that it involves the church in the future."
5,Worthy of the Hype,"This book is on every serious list of best science fiction novels ever written. After reading this book I can assure you that its status is well deserved. Readers looking for aliens with giant laser beams fighting an intergalactic war for the ULTIMO device should not read this book. However, readers who understand that true classics leave the reader contemplating the true nature of man will enjoy this very much.Some people seem to have a problem with the amount of ""religion"" in this novel. I personally did not think this book was preachy at all. However, the ULTIMO beam crowd may not be able to handle it."
5,Hits Very Close to Home,"With all the recent talk of potential nuclear terrorist attacks and the current threat of nuclear war between India and Pakistan, A Canticle for Leibowitz is as fresh and meaningful today as it was when it was first published in 1959.Readers may, at first, be surprised by how Catholic this novel is. It follows the Albertian Order of Leibowitz - a future religious order of bookleggers and memorizers who have been entrusted with the safekeeping of history in their monastery.Set 2000 years into the future, the book examines what remains after the human race virtually destroys itself through nuclear war, and the gradual rebuilding of society brought again to the brink of nuclear war in the far distant future.The novel is both terrifying and fascinating. One comes away from the book recognizing the eternal nature of the Church, and the role of monastics to safeguard doctrine."
2,Plodding and uninteresting,"This is a book that has a decent premise hidden somewhere under the layers of yawn-inducing detail. For the amount of pages this book contains, almost nothing happens. This isn't necessarily a fault, since plot is not necessary as long as the ideas and detail are still intriguing. But alas, this book falls short in all of these except for a spattering of comical details. I kept reading because I thought that, it being the classic it is considered to be, it HAD to get better. Sadly it didn't, and I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
2,Maybe it's just me,"I purchased this book on the many five star recommendations that I read, only to be disappointed.Between the overly verbose conversations and droll tedium there were parts where the story progressed. The continuity between the ages and church vs. state dilemmas are interesting, but you really have to dig through the fluff for it.Unlike some of the other 1950-60's books I have read that stood up (i.e. Heinlein's and Aasimov's books), this one did not stand up to the ages well - and I'm not just talking about the use of Latin.This story could be half as long and accomplish just as much, but it was written in a time when literature was ornately over-worded (i.e. Lord of the Rings, Atlas Shrugged, etc.) so I feel this story fit the generation from whence it came. By today's standards though, it's a bit of a tired slog :("
2,book less than the radio adaptation,"How often do you see the headline above? I'm guessing not often. Several years ago, the public radio station where I lived had a live actor version this book. I was so intrigued, and figuring that the stereotype of the book being better than the movie/tv show/etc would hold up, I went and hurriedly got a copy. So slowly paced is the action, so uninteresting are the characters that this is another book I just couldn't bring myself to finish."
2,A Canticle for Leibowitz 1959,"Plot Kernel - Told in three timeframes from the viewpoint of Catholic monks: (1) Centuries in the past, there had been a nuclear war. Now scientific and historical ignorance is universal; only a few salvaged incomplete manuscripts of the past remain, kept in the care of a Catholic order of monks who are dedicated to their preservation but have no understanding of their meaning. (2) Further Centuries later, rudimentary scientific principles are only just becoming understood. Tensions arise among the monks in regard to these rediscoveries. (3) Further Centuries beyond, the old pre-nuclear-war world has been rebuilt, along with space travel. Nuclear war erupts."
2,Catholic martyrdom complex run amok,"Thankfully, I borrowed this book from the library rather than buying it. The plot idea is quite interesting, if hardly novel even for its own day. But the writing is quite clumsy, and the theology is increasingly ham-fisted. The book has three parts, set several hundred years apart, each further in the future. The first two are relatively restrained and readable, but the last section quickly heads into hectoring, moralizing, and self-flagellation that can only be taken as the apocalyptic vision of a guilt-ridden Catholic, which I assume the author was."
2,"Great, another worthless review by a wannabe writer","Always listed as a ""must read"" this book is as good as is all the recommended books coming from the government schools. It's mish mash! The writing is circular, therefore vague. That's why so many ""reviewers"" like it--who can pin down the story? Read it if you want to put another ""notch"" in your list of important books you've read."
3,I did not enjoy this book as much as other SF books,"I started the book and was instantly appaled. It was incredibly slow but I thought ""Give it a few chapters, it'll get better."" But no! The only reason I read the entire thing, was for an ISU. Although I have to admit, there were a couple good spots, maybe two per part, but other than that, it was no good. I would not recommend this book."
5,Disproportionately Good,"Well it won Hugo so what else should I say?It is a awesome book which in way reflects the state of some sciences today such asArcheologyAnthropologyPhysicsI should say the church too but i have seen the church specially catholic talking about UFOs and hence i think they are following the maxim ""If you cant bit them join them"" see you cant burn people on today... so if some one says ""Hey i saw a UFO"" the priest just winks an eye..and so and so..We are currently experiencing a DARK AGE though many think this is an age of Elightment... couldnt be more wrong..."
5,Tragic irony,"I won't explain what I mean by 'tragic irony', as it would reveal the latter part of the novel. Perhaps I can say that it's ironic given the author's death.I read 'CFL' when I was 21, and was blown away. I read it age 45 and was similarly blown.If anything, it reminds me of Russell Hoban's 'Riddley Walker' (early 80's). Both are brilliantly inventive post-apocalyptic novels. Hoban is more secular; Miller is more religious, but ultimately neither gets in the way of a phenomenal story.I enjoy the conceit that, in a distant future, dark-age religion is the bastion of enlightenment. A conflicted POV, and I'm sure Walter was conflicted, too.I'm sorry; I've been cryptic. If you enjoy magnificent, epic science fiction, and have not read this, you're like a classical music fan who hasn't heard Beethoven's Violin Concerto.It's a tortured, visionary epic."
5,Perhaps the Best Book Ever,"I would have to rate this book as one of my favorites. If you're looking for a chilling story that will stay with you, then this is a good book. It is remarkably easy to read, yet unlike most modern ""literature"", the story has depth.""Liebowitz"" is divided into three separate parts, with the first and the last being able to stand alone, yet when put together compliment each other. The second part, on the other hand, needs the other two chapters.I first read this book for my Sophmore English class in High School. I just recently read it again. In the years that I matured, the meaning of the story changed greatly.I would recomend this book to anyone, young or old, who wants to read a wonderful piece of literature, or just wants a good story."
2,"This ""Gem"" Should Stay Hidden","A truly talented cast cannot save this beached whale of a comedy. It misses on every comic level, from slapstick to sight gags to attempted witty social commentary.Very disappointing to see so much talent wasted."
2,Only in a Very Dry Desert,"This movie has some excellent acting, starting with the always wonderful Michael Caine, and some very funny moments, but it lacks one important ingredient: a script. The story beings promisingly and then just slowly evaporates. Worth watching if you are an inveterate Caine fan or feel nostalgic about that Caribbean island you visited."
1,A BOMBER...!!!.......Don't waste your time....,Apologies to all who gave this movie a 5 star rating...but....this movie is a huge bomb....the acting is BAD...especially Brenda Vaccaro and Billy Connoly (both are good actors hampered by bad writing and even worse casting)......the premise of the movie is just plain stupid and even worse is the script......sorry...but don't waste your time on this one....maybe it was OK 30 years ago and while smoking a joint but this movie is just plain BAD....
5,An Old Fashioned Very Funny Comedy.,A few years ago I bought an ex Video Hire store VHS copy of Water and often viewed it. I looked forward to being able to buy a copy on DVD and when I spotted it on Amazon I immediately ordered it. I enjoyed the performance of Michael Caine and the whole cast. I am pleased to have the DVD in my collection and have viewed it twice since it arrived. I will no doubt view it a few more times when I need something funny to uplift my spirits.John D
1,DVD Format,"I ordered a dvd from Amazon and was very happy with the delivery and packaging. Unfortunatly, as I live in Australia, we have Pal system and the dvd is in Ntsc. I cannot play the dvd. My mistake. Maybe Amazon could put up an alert when sending dvd's to Pal countries for dummies like me."
4,"""Water"" starring Michael Caine","This is a great, fun movie especially if you live on or visit a British island. Great to see George Harrison and Eric Clapton singing together."
3,Interesting but too brief for true crime fans...,The book was absorbing but too little detail is given for each of the cases. I'd like to have heard more information about the cases from a defense point of view but often it was from the prosecutions perspective. The auther tends to be a bit biased in his reporting. Overall a chilling and quick read for true crime fans.
4,A good summary of a legend's work,"I am not an expert of Django's style of music, but have become a fan after seeing ""Sweet & Lowdown"". He really is unique in his approach to the guitar... now I know why Chet Atkins, Les Paul, and others sought out his recordings in their formative years."
3,Poor sound quality mars a great musician,"Django Reinhardt and his style of jazz certainly is good listening, and definitely characteristic of the era around WWII in Europe. But the quality of the sound on this CD is terrible -- surely some of the noise could have been removed without losing the feel of the music."
5,Good compilation,"Although the title is called best of Django Reinhardt, some of the good pieces are not there. On the whole it is a good compilation."
2,Disappointed,"Am a huge fan of Django and own several of his CD's. However, was disappointed at the selection of his ""best"". Recorded other songs that were more appropriate for the best than what is on this CD."
5,The Best of Django Reinhardt,"This man is brilliant. However, after listening, it is not my style of jazz...which does not reflect on this man's genius."
5,now you know why he's the king,buy this and you will understand the talent and popularity of django. a beautiful piece of music that everyone can enjoy.
4,Brilliant,"Obviously a little dated and if you are not used to listening to this kind of music may be a little tough to get through the entire CD in one setting. However, if you appreciate find playing by a skillful, pioneering musician this one is well worth owning."
5,A comprehensive recoding of an historic musician,[[AThiThis recording is an excellent study in music thru the years of this remarkable jazz guitarist.In addition the jacket notes offer a fine capsule bio which places him in the pantheon of guitarists of all types.I purchased this for my son who is a rock guitarist.:B000005H2Y The Best of Django Reinhardt.

4,firearms engraver,"This book contains a wealth of information on how to engrave. topics include: scroll design, layout, inlays, and tool sharpening. I would have liked to see more information on gold inlays in print and pictures. It even has a section on power engraving. Overall this book is helpfull to the expert and novice alike."
5,"Sweet, sweet, Nostalgia","grew up with this series and happy to see it's finally on dvd and unlike some peeps i havent watched on netflix beforehand so yes, im happy with this but my only complaint is that this volume leaves us off in the middle of the shadowborg saga (and the next one is going to leave us off in the middle of the metallix one)"
5,totally amazing,"lines on the mirrors, dark circles around my eyes... this album pumping through my soul... sheesh, can't stop listening! it's like I'm god and I walked into a rave in heaven and NEED were at the console... wait, I have to go play this again! can't... stop... sniffffff........."
3,Ambient melodic idm,"I wanted to give this album 3 1/2 stars. if you like techno and idm music, this isn't a bad album at all, i bought it and i'm pleased with it. it's great for playing as background music or while sleeping. it's much more melodic than many percussive beat-heavy electronic acts. Very bright melodies, nothing dark like Coil, more like tosca with less drum sounds."
1,The Power of Divine: A Healer's Guide,"I was very excited about receiving this book, but then was disappointed to discover it was Christian-oriented. From the description I was led to believe it was metaphysical in nature, so I'm returning the book. I was hoping it would be a great addition to my collection of metaphysical healing references. This would probably be a great book for someone of the Christian faith, but it will not work for me."
5,Worth its weight in Gold - complete how-to book on Healing,"I bought this book from Tiffany's website before it even came out on Amazon - and it's truly worth any effort to get one. I have been involved with energy healing for over 20 years, and still learned new things from this book. Many fellow healers have become sick over the years, and this book answers many reasons why, and what to do to prevent it. Also, the chapter on barriers to healing is a very interesting one, a topic that is not addressed often or thoroughly. This is a well-rounded book, for the new healer, and the experienced one. For those wishing to be healed themselves, it gives an inside track on what the process is, and the variation of results, from their part in it. I'm recommending this book to my friends and clients alike."
2,OK At Best,"This book The Power of Devine, by Tiffany Snow was OK at best. I highly recommend Past Life's Future Healings by Sylvia Browne ISBN number 1565114809, if you are seeking a book with ""Substance"" that goes much deeper."
5,The Power of Divine - A Healer's Guide,"I have been looking for healing methods that are not bogged down by religious dogma, mysterious spirituality, a holier than thou attitude. I am a practical person; either the methods work, or they do not. Dr. Snow's methods do. She is definitely an advocate of connection with Divine, and I do not feel prejudiced against by how she views God or Source, she encourages all to make the connection, with suggestions and techniques that are straight-forward. Some are easy, some are not. I liked it. Well done !"
4,Good solid guide through Luke,"Many years ago, I read this commentary cover-to-cover. I had some good introductory knowledge of the Bible at the time, and I can remember that this commentary filled my brain with a ton of great facts and information on Luke's gospel, and cleared up many tricky passages.Morris' commentary cannot compete with the more recent, larger commentaries because this series has much briefer volumes. But don't let its size fool you. It has some good insights in it. If you have some of the bigger commentaries (e.g., Bock, Marshall, Fitzmyer, Green, Plummer, Nolland, Stein, Ellis, etc.), you will probably won't need this.However, if you are a casual reader of the Bible, or you are a small group Bible study leader, you will find that this gives you excellent information of a historical, cultural, and linguistic nature so you can better understand Luke's gospel."
4,A good solid introductory level commentary,"To appreciate this commentary, and we should, one needs to understand the purpose in writing it. Tyndale designed this series of commentaries to be a solid introductory level commentary to encourage and enlighten the average layperson as they begin to truly study the Bible as opposed to just reading it.This commentary more than adequately fills the role it was designed to. I am using it with a men's discipleship group I lead as an adjunct to the series I am preaching in the church I pastor. The men have continually been positively motivated and encouraged by Dr. Morris' scholarship.I would recommend this commentary for those who are interested in becoming students of God's word. It is an excellent introductory commmentary to aid in your study.Pastor Walt MayhewChristian Community ChurchDerby, CT"
3,A standard TNTC work.,"Dr Morris, once again delivers what we have come to expect from the TNTC series, namely not that much. While this work is a good introductory commentary for the first time Luke reader, serious readers need apply elsewhere.Morris sometimes skips over whole textual and or theological discussions with a wave of a hand.Please, first look in your used book section for this one. For a more comprehensive study on Luke, get D.L Bock in the BECNT series, or J.A Fitymer in the Anchor Bible series.Rick E Aguirre Southern California (Aguirre100@aol.com)"
4,"Compact, Reliable, To the Point","Leon Morris just went to be with the Lord. I thank God that we have his books so that he still speaks, even though he is gone. This commentary on Luke is like all of Morris' work in that he interprets the scripture well, and he is easy to follow.This is not one of his major opuses, it is a hand held paperback commentary. But Morris has a good understanding of Luke's gospel, and it will come in handy for the Sunday school teacher and the pulpit preacher. I still use it to this day. I rarely ever preach from the NT without seeing what Dr. Morris has written on the subject.This is quality, inexpensive scholarship. Pick this up and add it to your library, or buy a copy for your church."
2,what a loss!,It was for my Toyota Camry 2000 that I drove in California. I wish the detail indicated that this is a universal item and will not pass emission test. I had to purchase a specific item that cost me three times more.
1,poor qualtiy,Ordered one and the voltage between the ground and heater was too large for the onboard computer (ECU) to register a functioning sensor. Returned for a replacement only to have the same problem. The manufacturing tolerances not good. This was for a 2003 Toyota Camry.
3,02 Sensor,"Perfect fit...only thing that i didn't like was that I could not just plug it in, I had to use the plug and wires from the orignal sensor in order to use the new one. If I knew this I would have spend the extra cash and purchase the complete o2 sensor... I would recomend it to others I would just let them know what has to be done before they purchase and have them make the decision if they want to do the extra steps to make it work..."
2,Wire it yourself???,"I bought this for my 2000 honda civic because the check engine light was coming on and said it needed a new one.When I received this one in the mail, I had to cut the connecter off my old one to wire to the new one because it onlycame with the wires but no connector to plug it in. Needless to say, it did not fix it and I will have to spend a little moreto buy a good one."
1,not universal,The denso universal is not actually universal as it turns out it WILL NOT WORK WITH FLEX FUEL VEHICLES. No tahoe from my own personal experience and from what the tech said from denso when I called it will not work with any of them. So if your car can use e85 gas you cannot use this sensor and it will set heater codes and make the car or truck have issues. To top it off desno knew of this issue when I called and did nothing for me on it and said go back to the vendor which amazon gave me my money back on it even though not really their problem so kudos to them for helping there and standing behind what they sell. Makes me fell better about shopping here and not having to worry about product issues as they will stand behind what they sell...
1,Didn't work for me....,"First of all shipping was fast, second thank you for the fast refund of the product...I purchased this O2 sensor to replace my original which has 278K on it. I followed the wiring instruction provided and less than a mile of driving I ended with a CEL. I even tried switching the ground and signal wire but the CEL came on even faster. I ended putting back my original O2 sensor which cleared the CEL. No more universal sensors for me. I will be purchasing a direct plug and play sensor locally so if any problem I can go back and replace it.BobSan Antonio TX."
4,"Works great, wish I paid extra for the easy install","I have a Lexus ES300 and I wanted to save a few bucks. The shaving of cables and fusing together with the existing connector was easy enough, but as I was doing it I honestly just said to myself that I'm an idiot for not paying the extra money and simply snapping the new one in. Considering the work I had to put into it and the fact that you still need to wrap the cables in more electricians tape (which I didn't have) to bind them together after you heat shrink the individual cables together, I should have just bought the sure fit.Additionally, I was troubleshooting CEL (Check Engine Light) codes and I'm not sure my old one was bad...so when I cut the OEM connector off, I was a bit gutted that I will never use it again as a backup. Ends up this sensor was NOT the problem, it was coils...so I just cut a perfectly good sensor because I was too cheap to buy the sure fit. Live and learn...and share on amazon ;)"
5,It's 1/4th the price of OEM sensor and worked like a charm!,"My 2001 Lexus IS300 has four oxygen sensors and so far three of them have been replaced with this Denso sensor model over a period of two years and they are all working perfectly! A Toyota/Lexus performance shop (not a dealership) in Liberty, NC, installed each for the minimum one hour labor charge. So basically, I bought this aftermarket sensor from Amazon *and* had it installed by someone who knew what they were doing for less than what the Lexus dealership wanted for the OEM sensor alone."
1,does not work with 2001 RAV 4,"Received this air flow sensor very quickly and at great price. installed it very easily, including modifying the wiring. check engine light came on within 1 minute. assuming part was ok, i ended up at the dealer and had him diagnose the problem believing it was a wiring problem. 100 bucks later, the resistance measured at the terminals is too high, therefore it's the wrong part. yes, i did go through the applicablity questions and the screen shows that it is applicable to a 2001 RAV 4."
4,Denso 234-4209,it buys east product and until now it has worked and it is very well of easy installation which facilitates the handling to the people of little experience.
5,Worked Like a Champ,"Replaced the original oxygen sensor on my 1996 Miata with this unit and it worked flawlessly.The wire colors were the same as the OEM sensor. The original sensor was probably a Denso too.If you don't mind splicing the OEM connector onto the new sensor, buy this and save $100.My check engine light stayed off and my car passed the emissions test."
3,Universal 4-wire O2 Sensor,"These sensors must be spliced correctly to work. Heater wires are not sensitive but other two wires must be correct and there are quite a few variations to check. I had to cross-check a wiring diagram to insure I had correct wires matched from harness to universal sensor.Also staggering the splices can be tricky and easy to screw up. In my case, the length requirement made the replacement harness 4-6 inches longer than orginal requireing a plastic wire tie to tuck the excess out of the way.All in all, I would opt for a exact replacement O2 sensor and pay the extra bucks next time."
1,Garbage,"I bought this denso oxygen sense 234-4209 universal back in march 22 of 2011. Weather has been bad in the chicago area, so i just replaced the o2 sensor may 3 2011. Reset the computer, so it can detect the good sensor well after driving over 50 miles and two days later the engine light came back on and guess what bad o2 senor the same one i justed replaced with this denso garbage.Trying to save money bought it through amazon which did save me money initially but know i'm out money for a part that never worked and now i have to spend more money on something i already bought, i will never buy automative stuff from amazon again. Bob is very very upset that amazon will not give me refund. Even though the part never work they sell JUNK."
1,Amazon's Error,Amazon... please stop your crossreference fit calculator. Denso 234-4209 is not comparable with RX300.I wish I could return these items but I due to its applicability I had to make the wires shorter.
3,Not compatible,"While this appears to be a decent quality part and comes with good directions, Amazon's compatibility checker is wrong. This item is NOT compatible with a 2001 Toyota Camry with the V6 - the Amazon checker indicates that it is. It turns out that my vehicle requires a ""wideband"" heated oxygen sensor, not the kind shown here. It would be safe to assume that any other Toyota vehicle with the 1MZ-FE engine would also not be compatible with this part."
2,Both were supposed to be NEW OEM,"Products were shipped in a timely fashion. They were NOT as advertised. Only one of them was NEW. The other, though it worked, was clearly used, with definitive signs of exposure to an exhaust stream. Just because someone wraps up the lead wiiring in rubber-band and puts it in a plastic bag, does not make it ""NEW"". I now worry about how long it will last. IE: Just HOW USED WAS IT !Seller, be sure and double-check your inventory."
4,Denso universal O2 sensor,"Good price for 4 wire sensor, but a bit more work than a custom fit unit. Be sure to save the wiring from you're old sensor. You need it to fit the universal one. Wiring's not very difficult with supplied crimp connectors and shrink wrap insulation. Only other tools you need are a cheap wire stripper/crimper and a wrench to remove/replace the sensor."
1,To hard to use,"I used this insert in my router. When I wanted to remove it, it always jammed inside the collet. I also had some ""slippage"""
1,You've already got better versions of these songs...,"If you are an Alan Parsons fan and already have most or all of the Project's and his albums, then you already have the better versions of these songs. It is as if person who created this CD decided to reproduce Alan Parson's greatest hists on their computer at home. For example, the producer uses a synthesized sax on a part that Parsons used a real sax. The ""orchestra"" is also synthesized. If you don't have all of Alan Parson's CDs, then use your money to buy what you are missing. Else, save your money."
1,Too little yarn for WAY too much money!,"My daughter bought this yarn to start a knitting project. It is nice yarn, but it is a tiny skein and it had a LARGE price tag.Check prices elsewhere to avoid getting RIPPED off."
1,Size on lable is incorrect,"The NY Wire 71439 Mesh Door Grill, 24-inch by 36-inch are only 34-inches wide and will NOT fit a 36-inch door."
4,Just the thing!,"This was just what I needed to protect our sliding screen door from our new puppy. He managed to turn our old door into his own doggie door, and when we replaced the screening we needed a way to keep those sharp nails from poking another hole in the new screen. Easy to install and worth it!"
