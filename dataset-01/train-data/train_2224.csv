2,Not for the casual reader,"I read a favorable review of this book and thought it would be interesting. Not so for me. Seems intended for the design professional or scholar, not the general reader. I suspect there is much good and meaty stuff here if one has the background and/or patience to study the text carefully. I do not!"
2,To broad,"I had to buy this book because it is listed in my curriculum in design history. It tries to cover the culture of all things, which is just to much."
2,Very disappointing,"The HMD-A200 was the first name brand monitor we purchased after owning an ""off brand"" 15"" for several years with no problems. The Sony gave out 1 month and 24 days after the warranty ran out. The Sony was certainly not inexpensive, much more so in fact than many of the other brands. It did look great--right up till the screen went black. Your money is best spent on another product."
3,Quality,"Loved it. All 3 tracks are great. the last one being one of the srangest, yet brilliant songs ive ever heard. Only makes me sure that Basement Jaxx are the Best around at the moment. Superb."
4,Short Stories of Vietnam,"This book creates vivid images of the many settings. The characters are regular people that you would know from home but in a different place. My favorite short story is called ""Ferguson and the Old Mama-san From Song Mao."" It's a great example of the confusing relationships that can occur in desperate times. In a way it's a funny story and has a great ending but is also makes you wonder what you would do if you were in Ferguson or Mama-san's place."
5,a good choice,"I have sony E200 17 inch monitor, and I absolutely likedit. Needing a new one, I decided to buy sony again, but 19 inch instead. The panel is even flatter (even a little concave for the first few hour looking). It really outbeat the other trinitron models I have seen. Buy this one!"
2,Inconsistent Punch Die Sharpness,"After reading about similar Punch Sets (and their shortfalls), I ordered this one from Grizzly hoping for the best. What I got is a collection of random quality punch dies - some are razor sharp and cut like no one's business. Others- well let's just say that they don't perform. Of the set approximately 40% of the dies are duds. If there is a way to sharpen these non-performers, I'd be on my way to being happy with this purchase.The punch handle has a nice chrome plating and a spring loaded centering punch and a small tensioning ball that holds the punch to the handle (like a ratchet holds sockets...). The plastic case is nice. Yet, I would hesitate recommending this to anyone because of the random sharpness of the dies."
5,"Thoughtful and thorough, without being didactic","I was first introduced to this book in a classentitled ""Religion and Politics"" at GeorgetownUniversity. The ingrained resistance to requiredreading dissipated within the first few pagesof Shipley's book. He writes with a first-handknowledge, without presuming the reader is hope-lessly ignorant, as so many other journalisticsurveys of modern politics do.And what a survey it is. Shipley peers into motivation,not simply cause-and-effect, and generates someinsightful observations on the cause of this chronicand cataclysmic brou-haha.In sum, the book is not only an excellent textbook,it was a fine read. I highly recommend it.(Irene Yao) irene117@hotmail.com"
4,a new direction for the godfathers of gore,"First off, if you love death/gore/grind/horror/whatever you wanna call necrophagia's genre..buy this album, you will not be dissapointed. for those of you who like some of necrophagia's material, this is sort of a somewhat new direction for the band, I say somewhat because I believe the songs have more range to them then those of the past. Divine art of torture had pretty much a catchy tune on each song, these songs like to diversify a little more and add much more range but still keep that 'it' that necrophagia does so well and we all love. This album also uses many more synths to add a horror effect (which personally i love, some may not). Songs such as akumu show what necrophagia are capable of (some may say its a filler but its one of my favorite tracks because it is so different) and if you absolutely love horror, buy this album for 'return to texas' alone because of Bill ""chop top, Otis P Driftwood""'s intro on it."
1,Don't purchase if you are a non-believer,"""... failure to have a spiritual, religious, or belief system outside yourself is likely to yield what we refer to as ***Self-Will Run Riot***, which is operating on your own will without direction. Since people who lack active support systems aren't used to reaching out for help -- whether therapeutic or spiritual -- conditions often spiral out of control when a crisis does hit.(Prima, 2000, p. 152 -- emphasis in original)""enough said."
1,Discouraging Read,"There are books that you just can't put down, and there is this one. I couldn't get very far after the barrage of negativity that this book dishes-out. This book makes change seem an insurmountable obstacle. They also emphasize the notion that your past equals your future -- pure bunk! This book needs a major rewrite!If the guys want a book that tells them how to have women approach them, get HOW TO SUCCEED WITH WOMEN by Louis and Copeland. These guys helped me to acheive the desired results, they can help you. I'm going out with a woman, half my age, who I would have been scared to approach not long ago. I've also had half a dozen women hit on me, at work, in the past two weeks -- life is good, now!"
5,Wonderful Collection,"This recording is a great collection of some of John Michael Talbot's quieter songs. His songs are worshipful, and have blessed me through the years. After listening to this recording many times, I began to purchase the original recordings from which this collection was made! But as an introduction to the quieter music of John Talbot, this is a great collection at a great price!"
5,Kreg Master System,Awesome product. I have used this for a couple of projects and will continue to use. Could not be happier.
3,Yes and no,"I didn't know whether to give this 3 or 4 stars. 3 would seem ideal. Pocket hole joints can be pretty sturdy, but not as strong as the advertising would have us believe. Edge-to-edge joints should usually be glue reinforced. For edge-to-face joinery they are not as strong as going straight in through the facepiece with countersunk screws. If strength is more important than external appearance, the latter technique would be recommended.The self drilling fastener screws are said to prevent splitting of the wood with Kreg joints. I found this to be true only if the screws are tightened manually, that is, slowly enough for the wood to adjust. When joining softwood edge to face at the edge of the facepiece, I found it easy to misalign the screws, so that they would come out of the facepiece's edge. One must exercise a little care here. The face clamp supplied with the kit doesn't look too robust.Despite the down side, I don't regret buying this system. It has some utility, and it's fun to use."
1,Reviewof item I never received.,I ordered the Kreg K3MS K3 Master Pocket Hole Jig System through Amazon.com and received the Kreg K4MS K$ Master Pocket Hole Jig System. I was able to returen the K4MS system and ask that I be sent the K3sylstem. Instead I received my money back and no a word as to why I could not get the K3 System as they had 5 in stock at the time I ordered it. I am still waiting for an answer.Carlos D. Montgomery.
4,Biscuits - who needs 'em?,"You can justify the purchase of the K3 with one project. You will save so much time on assembly and even more not needing any clamps and glue or drying time. My first project was a large frame for a HT screen, the second was some shelves. I am now going to build an entertainment center.Buy the Right Angle Clamp (RAC) as you will need it and the kit should really include one. Okay I am sure there are a few things where biscuits would be a better solution but it is a very short list if you have the K3."
4,Kreg rocks!,"The good: Very well thought out tool system. Although it is mostly plastic, the parts that count are high quality metal. Works right out of the box. Watch the DVD it is well presented. Will save you time, creates a really strong joint, easy to use, and looks good.The Bad: The case you get is not the one in the picture with all the compartments. You get a case with NO compartments and all the little parts in a cardboard box. Yuck.You may need another clamp or two. You are also going to need more screws."
5,Awesome product!,This was just what we hoped it would be - great! It is easy to use yet yields professional looking results.
5,Excellent Item,"I've been using this to join boards for some shelving in my basement. It takes a little bit of getting used to but I think its great. No need for clamps and cuts down on the time over biscuit joining, gluing, and clamping."
4,Kreg K3MS K3 Master Pocket Hole Jig System,"one of the best tools Ive ever purchased. Even my brother, a contractor, was impressed and is now getting himself one. Top Quality Product, though a tad expensive I think which is why I only gave four stars instead of five."
5,Using the Kreg Pocket Hole Jig System,I built the finish framework for two sets of double windows. Using the Kreg jig tool really made the work much easier. It was so easy to put together the frame for the windows. Its already paid for itself. I still have 10 windows to frame out so it will come in handy.
5,Changed my finishing technique and provided more options,Great kit. I bought it never having used a pocket hole kit. I did 2 practice joints and rolled right into cabinet facing finish work with great results. Kit includes all you need to be quite effective and the case provides room for all the components and extra bits and screws. Only advise is use a good drill with a settable clutch to prevent stripping screws in joints. This makes makes face joints strong and great looking with out glue squeezeout
4,Invaluable kit for home use,"Though I would not use this product if I worked in a cabinet shop (I would expect to be using a bench top machine) I would recommend this to any woodworker from novice to expert. The stationary clamping jig mounts nicely to a scrap of plywood and can then be camped to a work surface when needed.Novices should note, as stated in other reviews, that pocket joinery is not the answer to all joining situations.The fixed clamp will only support boards of a few feet. Any longer and the mobile clamp should be used else the board will slip and misalign the holes.With these few thoughts in mind the Kreg Jig K3MS K3 Master Pocket Hole System is an awesome addition to my home workshop."
5,Kreg K3 Pocket Hole System,"I found this to be one of the neatest tools I have purchased in a long time. Making framework sections are much stronger and easier to hide. I also purchased the hardwood plugs which virtually remove any signs of the connection. This is a great product, and I highly recommend it to anyone else."
4,Best Book,"This is the best book for GMAT prep on the market by far. The tips were good, the CD rom had a lot of useful information, and there were a lot of practice tests. The CD rom not only scored the practice tests, it categorized the number of right and wrong answers and noted when a correct answer was changed to an incorrect one and vice versa. The answer explanantions were the best I've encountered. I highly recommend it."
5,This is all you need!,"This book was a huge help - I felt pretty confident about my verbal skills, but was pretty worried about the math section of the GMAT. The practice tests -- especially the simulated tests on the CD-ROM -- were incredibly helpful in boosting my math score (my verbal improved, too). Plus, I felt much more comfortable during the actual CAT because I had practiced with the CD-ROM so much. I liked the book, too, because of the helpful test-taking strategies and sidebars that pointed out hints and tips on how to do well. This was the most comprehensive study guide I found."
5,A life saver!,I have not taken a test like this in more than 10 years and I have never taken a test on computer before so I was pretty nervous about the GMAT. This book is great -- lots of practice tests and good practical suggestions. I feel well prepared for the test.
1,Waste of Money,"The math section is twice as hard as the actual GMAT, which discourages you when you keep getting stuck. The CD ROM is a waste of effort. After taking the practice test only 1 time, the program told me that the next 3 practice test would contain repeat questions that I had already answered before. Furthermore, the CD-ROM kept freezing my computer and shutting me down. Kaplan should send the CD back to the software company."
3,there's something better out there,"I bought The Princeton Review Cracking the GMAT 2001 edition and this one, thank God I read The Princeton Review first. The question and answer in this book is confusing, especially on the math part. If you're thinking about buying this book, I hope it's not the only book you're going to use for studying the GMAT. I strongly suggest you have somthing else too. I think it's really important to learn the techniques of spotting the traps in the questions rather than just take the test as you would on a regular test. This book doesn't teach too much of that."
2,better choices,"I think Princeton book is far better than this book. I got both of them and I am sure glad I started with Princeton Book because I am lost with this one, very short and vague explanation. it shows they want you to take the class and not get away with 30 bucks."
3,Not As Good As The Art of Dragonlance Book,"Maybe I'm just more nostalgic for the original Dragonlance series but I found this newer art book lacking when compared to the much older ""The Art of Dragonlance.""There are a few images taken straight from that book in this book but, for the most part, Masters of Dragonlance Art seems to focus more on the post-Legends series (which I did not appreciate as much as the earlier Weis/Hickman collaborations). There is also a disturbing dearth (if not absence) of Larry Elmore's works (whom I consider, along with the late, great Keith Parkinson, to be the true artistic masters that defined the look of the Dragonlance universe).If you're a fan of the ""old school"" Dragonlance, this book is probably not for you. If you enjoy the newer installments to the series or just want to collect anything Dragonlance, this lightweight book may be just your thing."
3,Fascinating book,"Compared to other artbooks, this one seems to be printed on lesser (less quality) paper. The pages are black, which is not very usual, thus rather fascinating or unusual.As for the artworks, I believe that too much space is wasted on the newer artists works, although the elder ones already have books that showcase their art. Some decline in art nicety is even apperent in my opinion...Rather nice buy though, and I recommend it to anyone who has the money to purchase such a piece of beautiful book."
2,Dragonlance art creators,"All fans of Dragonlance ""must"" read this artbook for further info on the art creators!"
2,"Slash the art, big disappointment",The first series was very good but it is clear that Seeley cares about the profit and not the product. This one and volume 2 is thrown together instead of created with quality. It really hurts the attraction of the story line and the relationship between Cassie and the big guy. Forget about this one and hope for a better future where Seeley is concerned with the plot AND the art.
5,suspense reader,"I just finished reading Dale Hudson's Dance of Death, the book jacket caught my eye because I was famaliar with the area where the story took place. I feel that he did a tremendous job in presenting the facts and the role played by those involved in this horrific event. My sympathies go out to the families of Brent & Renee. I can not imagine what those months must have been like, nor can I imagine what must have gone through Renee's mind that night on the beach! But in reading and re-reading I can't help but believe a large portion of the evidence against John Frazier was circumstance and the jury truly must have wrestled with those ideas. Dale Hudson is a superb author and had me hooked from the first page of this story. I applaude his efforts to look deeply into Renee's troubled past and all the scenario's that could have brought this entire family to this tragic end. This is a first rate publication and I highly recommend this author."
1,Not worth the time,It was my impression that the author of this book went through the files of this crime and came up with almost 400 pages of interviews and testimony. It is boring. Then a hasty conclusion with hackneyed moralization about girls who chose the world of the stripper end up destroying themselves. There is no discussion of the fact that the husband was greatly responsible for his wife's career. No comments of his inability to function sexually unless some form of porn was involved. A good true crime book includes the progression of personalities and circumstances that finally leads to the crime. The author is too busy copying from interviews and court records to bother to do this. Don't waste your time!!!!
1,Really bad book,"The moral of the story is right out of Southern Baptist dogma - girls who enjoy sex deserve to be in prison. We get the author's views on morality throughout the book, plus a good look at the Southern cop mentality. Anyone with any sense should get angry reading this book, and not at Renee Poole. Not that she isn't a low-life - she is - but just give us the facts and let us decide for ourselves. I read fast and only wasted a couple of hours on this, but it was still annoying."
1,ZZZZZZZzzzzzzz,"I just couldn't get into this book. I really enjoyed Hudson's ""An Hour To Kill"". Infact, I couldn't put it down so I figured this would be same. However, I was bored while reading it. If you haven't read ""An Hour To Kill"", I highly recommend it."
3,A bit Disappointed,"The reason I bought sony monitor because of its sharp and clear display. I also like the flat screen, however, it also comes with some distortion (I believe it's called pincushion effect). I find it disturbing. I tried to use sony's menu to correct the problem, but it doesn't work. What I see is slightly curved lines instead of horizontal lines. Interestingly, this distortion gives a 3D effect to the pictures that is displaying which is not a good thing."
2,Review,I really liked this monitor when I got it. It looked great and I loved the wide screen on it. I spent 350 on it and was hoping I didn't have to buy a new monitor. Well this monitor only came with a 1 year manufacturer warranty and broke in a year and 3 months... I was really disappointed to spend so much money on a monitor to not even have it last 2 years.It has a great picture and the vertical lines were fairly noticable but only on a white background. I guess I learned my lesson when buying a monitor with only 1 year warranty and from sony.
1,HMD-A200 Production Problems?,"I had a highly visible ""distortion"" problem with this monitor. Vertical lines near the middle of the picture were severely distorted. The monitor has built in adjustments to deal with distortion around the edges, but there's no way to control distortion near the center. I had high hopes for this monitor, but had to return 2 of them."
5,CONNEX LINK .,Connex links work just like they're supposed to . I Use them on all my bikes and you should too .
5,Great vacuum pump,"Years ago, I replaced my A/C compressor on two vehicles and borrowed a neighbors vacuum pump. This past Summer I had to replace the compressor in my F-150 so I went ahead and this one. It worked great."
3,coffee pot problems,"My 2-year old loves the barbeque area, but hardly touches the kitchen area except to get food to put on the barbeque. Our coffee pot was all dried up when it was delivered (doesn't fill up or pour, just has some permanent streaks on the sides). We contacted them and they said they would send us a new one for free. What came was a huge box that had an entire prepackaged set of stuff that included a whole new barbecue, and the new coffee pot has the same problem as the old one! I don't know if I'll bother contacting them again since I really don't want three barbecue sets and there obviously seems to be a problem with their coffee pots."
4,Son's Kitchen,"I thought the toy was great. We gave it to him Christmas morning and he loved it instantly. It is so cute and clever with having the kitchen on one side and the grill outside. He loves it! The quality of it is not great. It is hard to get the refrigerator door to close and other pieces don't fit exactly. But, he does not seem to care."
1,READ THE REVIEWS FIRST,"I was totally disappointed. There were only two doors which contained pre-drilled holes. Even those two make a loud popping noise when you open and close them. I had to get my drill and drill eight holes for the other doors. Buyer beware, it really takes two people to install the two main plastic parts. I would not recommend this product to anyone. It's overpriced for the quality. I wish I had read the reviews first."
1,Junk Junk Junk!!!!!!!!!!!,"We have lots of Little Tikes items and none of them were anything like this. Here I was Christmas Eve Drilling holes for the doors!!!!!!!!! They were suppose to be predrilled. The doors don't shut correctly and the microwave oven door is busted. I called little tikes and they are willing to replace it, but first I have to mark all over the unit and email them pictures. What is my son going to think of that??? I am totally disappointed with this item!"
1,"Cool Concept, But a piece of Junk","My husband and I were very excited when we first saw this kitchen, we thought it was great that it was double sided, We bought it for our kids and were going to give it to them for Christmas, luckily we bought it early enough when I was putting it together not a one of the doors would close without extreme force and they made awful clicking noises, the microwave door was way bigger than the opening to close into. I would not recommend this kitchen, we ended up taking it back and purchasing the Step 2 Dream kitchen which is great we had no problems with putting it together."
4,Fun but not very sturdy,"My Husband and I bought this for our 16 mo old son as he had played w/ it at a party and seemed to like it and we liked that it was pretty neutral for boys and girls as far as kitchens go. The thing took forever to put together, but once assembled it looks great. None of the doors fit quite right but my son doesnt seem to mind all that much and he loves playing with it. My one big problem with it is that it has tipped over twice. The first time was when he climbed onto the sink by using the little bench as a step stool..guess you cant fault the manufacturer for that one but needless to say the bench is now in the closet. The second time though it fell right onto him when he was pulling on the cabinet door trying to get it open and it fell right onto him...and this time he wasnt doing anything wrong. Considering the height of the thing its a bit top heavy and there should be some sort of footing on the front so that this thing cant tip over that easily!!"
2,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"I could not wait to purchase this item. What a unique idea! An outside AND inside cooking center. NONE of my doors work at all. The microwave won't close-about one FULL inch too big. The refrigerator door won't close unless you push the top, then the bottom in and the dishwasher and oven doors POP so loud when they open, it sounds like a firecracker. Maybe we purchased a ""lemon"" but this was a nightmare! Very disappointing."
4,My two year old hasn't stopped playing with this since we put it together!,For the last hour my two year old has been playing with this kitchen non-stop! My husband had no problems putting this together - it took him less than an hour. I do wish the phone was easier to hang up and there was more food included but other than that we are very pleased with this product!
1,What a letdown!!!,"My husband went to assembly this piece of junk on Christmas Eve, only to find out it wasn't even worth his time. My daughter's first Christmas was basically ruined!!! There was a crack on one of the doors and even when we were able to work it out so the doors could go on, it didn't fit right. I've read previous reviews about the possibility of the doors not fitting right but had no idea it was this terrible. It's going back first thing in the morning!!"
3,All You Need To Know About RC Helicopters,"From the physics to the final needed adjustment tweek of the rotor blade, this book will teach you how build and repair your own Radio Control Helicopter."
5,Great!,Got this for my wife for her birthday. She loves it! Baked a nice egg cake for Easter and it was a big hit!
2,Ghost image makes the black text too grey,"especially when the background is white. Very high eye strain at any refresh rate, guess due to the ghost image problem (eyes try to get a better focus on an unfocused screen)."
4,missing pieces,"did the job it was bought for but was sent with 2 'chisel tips' instead of a 'chisel tip' and a 'soldering tip'. in hindsight should have just gone to a store and got one, would've been worth the extra few $"
2,works great if you can find the soldering tip,"This thing is slowing down, its my first gun and i am not impressed, like the other review mines came with two chisel tips, it works but its kinda awkward, should have gone with the weller, good luck to those who got replacement tips"
5,Wow,"My old soldering gun still works, but is all patched up holding with duck tape, I needed a new one and this one covered my need."
2,you get what you pay for,It was not hot enough for the job. Pay more for something better. The sharp flated head was difficult for applying heat on the object.
2,Broke after a month,"My son received this for Christmas 2005 and played with it every day. The conveyor belt is noisy when running and the sponges that whirl around at the end of the car wash were constantly falling off and getting lost. After a month of being played with on a daily basis the conveyor belt stopped working - it still made plenty of noise but didn't move anymore! When I called Mattel they couldn't offer me replacement parts as the toy was discontinued in 2001! Although they gave me a voucher to buy a replacement toy, it wasn't for as much as I paid for the toy."
2,Too Flimsy,"I bought this for my four year old son for Easter. The pieces were rolled up at at the edges slightly and although he is very good at puzzles, it frustrated him immensly. The pieces would not stay together because they were too thin and rolled up at the edges.This was fine because we left them out and covered them with books to flatten. The only problem is that whenever he puts it away this happens again. I love many Leap Frog products, but I would not recommend this one."
5,A gift my boyfriend loves!,"I bought these shoes for my boyfriend. They look great and he loves them! They are casual enough to go with jeans, but look infinitely better than sneakers. They fit true to size and are comfortable enough for my guy to wear all day while working at a standing desk."
4,"Nice, Comfortable Boot","Very nice, classic looking boot. Goes great with jeans or chinos. Couldn't believe how quiet they are when walking around too. Not clunky at all. Definitely would recommend."
5,Boyfriend loves them,"They're great - true to size, very attractive, very comfortable. I'd definitely recommend them - great price for good quality!"
1,Flashy but not Realistic,"Great looking video, flashy, well choreographed but.......It is the usual flashy ckm stuff. Problem is the contents are not what moni claims, and if he is less than truthfull about that you have to ask questions about the rest. In short its infotainment, Moni has changed half the techniques since this was made and they are unproven and are not used by any military. Reccomend some of the wagner stuff or mma leave this on the shelf."
5,GREAT! From novice to desk builder,"My woodworking experience revolves around looking at little destroyed splinters and saying ""Well, that didn't work."" My ONLY successful project before this weekend was a riser for my mixer.Thanks to the Kreg Jig, that changed. I built a new Studio desk and racks this weekend. Wood cutting and joining was done in a day. I now have a 6 foot long desk with 40U of rack space built for $250, including materials and the Kreg jig. Finishing it was the hard part. I used a portable work table, a drill, and a circular saw. That's it. The hard part was figuring out how to clamp the pieces.Seriously, this is dead easy, and excellent for anyone who is tired of paying $100 for particle board furniture. Buh-bye cheap bookcases. My only complaints would be the default 6"" long driver bit, and the fact that you get maybe 20 screws with the kit. Add the 3"" driver bit and the Kreg Screw Pak."
3,Cheap,"Its perfectly square. That's the good news.The Bad: the markings don't look like they will last long. It is obviously a cut, stamped piece of aluminum, and I can't rely on the end of the rule to start precisely at zero.Not too bad for a cheap square; it will do the trick for some operations that don't depend so much on measurement as it depends on square."
4,new in 1992 and still working,The battery function never worked.This unit has been in the guest room most of it's life. Every time someone visits I reset it because there is a power outage where I live every month. Other than that it has been a real champ. Easy to set. I have lousy reception in my neighborhood so only a couple stations come in clear and the sound is adequate.
4,Faithful Companion,"I've owned the same Dream Machine for 16 years, and only recently has it decided to stop working. The only problem I've had with it was that at some point many years ago, it didn't seem to care that it had a back up battery and would lose the time after losing power for 30 seconds.I wake up to the radio, and have found it to be plenty loud when waking, although the buzzer may be too quiet for some.In terms of longevity and reliability, I highly recommend it."
1,$136 for 12 boxes?,$136 for 12 boxes?Is this a rare item?That's $11.33 a box.I think the item might be a bit overpriced.
4,Look man...I only need to know one thing....where..they..are,This game is really fun and is filled with challenges and areas. You can be walking around and an alien pops in front of you. Its hard in a lot of ways. Your in an area with 2000 bullets. Sounds easy. In 5 mins your out of amo with 20 aliens dead and about 60 more ready to kill. I suggest you play the mini games at first to get the hang of the controles. Then begin to fight for your life. When you play it is really dark. So put on different visions to get a better look around. The Predator is really hard for me. I killed about 5 people before I died. I tried to get some cheats but tthey were fake. The alien is kinda stupid because he goes so fast you would run strait past the enimes.(humans and predators) The game is more alien than Predator. But fans of Predator will find the game good for the fact you could be it.
4,I ain't got time to bleed!,"Alien vs Predator is one of the scariest games I ever played. The game gots great graphics and and awsome sound effects. You can hear your Marines scream with fear when you play as the Predator and snipping with the Predator is fun. With the Alien you can cut Marines into up to 5parts and chop heads off. The Marine is awsome to! You can use Smartguns and Pulse Rifles. Overall the game is fun and scary. The downside is the game is way to short, but for $20 at Amazon what else more do you want. I really recommend this game to anyone who likes first person shotter."
4,Great Game,This game is great. It only gets 4 stars because of its limited multiplayer and single plyer levels. The game itself is probably one of the best ever. The fact that you can choose from three different species sets it apart form other FPS games. The gameplay is amazing and difficult.
2,"ok, but not long enough","i am an avid gamer, and am very fond of the aliens series, so i thought that this game would be a dream come true. infortunately, it wasn't. first of all, there are only 15 different maps. the maps get reused so frequently, it gets boring after a while. the learning curve is vewry basic, despite what the box says, and the alien is by far the easyest (sp?) to use. the marine is at an unfair disadvantage, as he only has a limite4d number of weapons, and they get taken away after every level. instead of a campain, the game has a mission sstem, like a video game. on top of that, you have to beat on the most difficult setting to play all of the ""unique"" levels. this is IMPOSIBLE to do with the marine. what this game needs is a really good add on, to save it from the pits of video game hell. if you want a good shooter, for the same price, buy half-life, game of the year edition; it comes with a free copy of team fortress, a game that alone blows avp out of the water."
5,"Bob Bailey's""Plain Talk About Leadership""","Loved Bob Bailey's book, Plain Talk About Leadership. Thought it had info for all endeavors of life. Quick and easy to Read. Loved the Silver Bullets. This book is not only for the business world, but High School students would get value from the book as well. I highly recommend it. Marilyn Bumpus Washington Court House, Ohio"
5,Illustrations in Leadership,"Bob Bailey provides many illustrations from his successful career to ""hammer home"" his points on Foundation of Leadership Being Great Communications. Mr. Bailey reinforces the importance of open, face to face, frequent and repetitive communications in creating an effective organization. I provided copies of this book to all my managers."
5,great and easy to use,I was very happy with how easy it was to use!I am never dissapointed by wilton products. even the instructions were easy to folow
1,Doubts on quality confirmed,I have purchased an inexpensive converter for a lower megapixel Sony (1.3 Meg) and could clearly see the reduction in sharpness. When I purchased my DSC-F717 I vowed to buy only Sony lenses. The cost savings is not worth it when compared to the cost of the camera and its high quality primary lens. From all the reviews about Sony lenses for the F717 everyone seems to be very satisfied with them.
1,This product is bad. Don't loose your money,"This product is bad. As you can see in the photo that i share without the Telephoto, the image is clear. But with Telephoto, the image appears out of focus, or no such way near that the others images say. The product is not so good. I lost my money because Opteka doesn't answer to my emails. Is the worst buy that i made.Realy you get that you pay.... Nothing."
1,never pay for this!,"bad bad way of waisting my money.. I used to have a SONY Cybershot DSC H1, I got this lens and all pics were BLURRY and SOFT... only was kind of good for videos.... not worth!!!"
1,This lens is not for Cyber shot H10... Not wear the lens,Dont lose your money... This lens dont wear whit Sony Cyber-Shot H10. It is a theft. Its misleading publicity
1,If you want to buy junk this is the perfect item,"You have to give it to those smart guys that know how through their marketing strategies make you belive that this IS the best thing since sliced bread. All I know is I am a consumer and I have multiple cameras and nothing but the best. When you spend the money you spend on buying a Sony 717 or 828, you may find junkmail in your mailbox but YOU DO NOT WANT TO FIND JUNK IN YOUR MAILBOX, certainly not when you pay for it. I wish I could return it without having to pay for shipping and restocking fees BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!!!"
4,Not really the best of,"I love the Colbert Report and was very happy a release of the best of clips dvd. I got the dvd and thought the set up of the dvd was big disappointment. The menu is basic scroll of clips and thats about it, well previews of other Comedy Central releases. Its not really the best of the show. Poor selection of clips, whoever picked them. The only saving grace for the dvd is the Better Know a District segements, which is one of the funniest segements in any variety/news show. Still I recommend it to Colbert fans because they love him no matter what."
4,Good for laughs,"Colbert is a favorite of mine and while I'm not sure these are ""the best"" clips from the show, the dvd is sure to entertain."
2,stick to the show on comedy central,Wow what a let down - i never laughed so little at Colbert material. I suppose every great comedian reaches sellout at a specific point of success. This is a perfect case study of what not to do when you are a successful comedian with a working television show.
1,So funny I forgot to laugh.,"This guy's dvd is hillarious (not). Seriously, Conans' dvd's are much funnier and entertaining. I would recommend sticking to serious talent."
5,Tip of the Hat!,"I've finally seen this DVD and I have to say that I spent the whole three hours laughing (not continuously, but close!). It was a wonderful peek into the world of Stephen Colbert and the awesome 'Colbert Report' and all the goings on in this man's head. I am a relatively new fan of Colbert and his show, so this look back on the Repor(t) from about early '07 and before to the very first episode was an incredible delight. I could probably go on and on about how much I liked it, but to make it short: The Best of The Colbert Report deserves a hearty Tip of the Hat and I recommend it to anyone who finds Papa Bear O'Rilley scary/a father figure and also loves making the best dessert in America; among other things; this DVD is for you! Awesome man (handsome too :) and a great show! Colbert '12!"
3,"I've Seen This As EIGHT Samurai, not Seven","This is a tough movie to follow, and a real departure for Chiba from the 80's kung-fu stuff. This is basically Kabuki theatre on film. I can't recommend it for kung fu fans, but it is an interesting piece of cheaply-available DVD fodder for Chiba fans.Certainly worh the few dollars. Can't tell if it was filmed in widescreen or not for sure, but the DVD is full-frame."
4,"A very good, clear, step-by-step guide",David is an enthusiastic and inspiring writer. This book can effectively take you through the very beginnings of variable star observation and set you on your way to becoming a productive observer able to submit valid data to organizations like the American Association of Variable Star Observers. Get it.
4,Cant go wrong for the price,We have 4 of these that we bring camping and traveling light and compact is key so that we have more room for supplies.It is not as comfortable as a much more expensive hammock but overall I would say it was a better deal considering the price and that you fold it fairly small.I didnt know you could buy this on line until now.
5,great item,this inexpensive hammock has added much to my backyard!! i did have to get 2 s-hooks to set it up and used it with the tree straps to go around my huge oak trees...but very nice addition to my yard!
4,Works well and lasts well in all weather.,"The only problem is finding supports for it. However, I have added some ropes to extend to branches under my favorite tree. Of course, It's portable but without a support frame, you need to be creative. However, when camping, there's no problem when I bring extra rope for the less than ideal situations."
4,Decent hammock for the price,"While I've got a larger, nicer hammock I keep down at the family lake, I wanted something for home use. This is great, seats one adult comfortable, two small kids well enough. Be warned, the rope included for hanging the hammock feels flimsy. It held my weight fine (~210lba) but I got some cheap chain at a home improvement store to be on the safe side, and for easy of moving the hammock."
4,Comfy at a fair price.,"It's not a big hammock and it does not have spreaders but I found it to be very comfortable. There was a very similar one at Target that was $25 more but I chose to save that money and I'm not disappointed. It came with two pieces of rope that came in very handy and a matching bag that would be great for camping. Also, the hammock that this was replacing was of the net like variety, and this is much more comfortable and easy to get into. Great buy."
5,very comfortable,anybody saying this is not comfortable or only for children need to read about how to actually sleep in a hammock this is a south american style it has no spreader bars so you don't just lay in it the same way
2,Not that great,"Wasn't very comfortable, limited range, and it just wasn't worth the $20 that I paid for it. There is probably a much better model for $10 more."
4,good buy,I used it for camping and loved it the whole time. Everyone who went with me kept using it and loved it too
1,wrong color,"I ordered from the picture the orange hammock, I returned it because it was blue/green striped. They immediately sent another one...BUT it was also Blue/green. SO I returned it as well. and was told that they could not choose another color."
5,A great hammock for great naps!,"This hammock was by far my best purchase this summer! It's easy and convenient to set up. I camp often and it's been great to take along as it is very portable and comes with its own carrying bag. Once it's broken in, it's a very comfortable place to take a nap or read a good book. You will have to buy something to hang it on a post or tree. I bought a set of microropes for cheap at a sporting goods store. Over all this was a great buy and I recommend it to anyone!"
2,eh,"Not that great. Functional for now, but I was less than impressed with the quality. Also, isnt very expensive. .."
2,Great until the strings snapped,"I've had my hammock for about two months. It's very comfortable.Recently, one string from either end of the hammock snapped. It now lists at an angle when you lay in it. I weigh 140 lbs and I haven't left it out in the rain or direct sun."
1,Poor quality,Got the hammock it worked out well but 2 weeks later the rope started to fray and break. I emailed the Texsport company and they nicely sent me another one to replace the broken one. But like the first one it started fraying at the ropes again. I guess I should of just spent more money on my hammock
2,not quite a wide as the picture,"When it came we promptly put it up, with the only issue being some loose treads that required retying. It's not quite a wide as the picture makes it out to seem, but nevertheless, it is roomy enough for two (short people)."
3,Not bad,"The hammock is a bit small for me (6' tall, 300lbs) width wise but it is still comfortable to sleep in. A few of the strings have already come undone (just one or 2 on each side) but I have been using this to sleep in at night in my bedroom and all in all it's not too bad."
4,The price is right!,"The price on this hammock is great and the colors are very outdoorsy and fun. However, one of the strings on each end of my hammock have already come loose. I do hope this doesn't mean the rest of the strings will fail soon. :< My grandkids love this hammock."
4,Good cotton hammock.,"For the price I will not and can't complain. It's comfy, it does cocoon around you but nothing that can't be taken care of. It does loosen due to the nature of cotton but I like it. Not a bad backyard hammock, just don't leave it out in the weather...again it's cotton."
2,I feel like a caterpillar...,"The price on this hammock is great, but the quality is not. ""Bed Size"" only refers to the cloth size. While it is hanging it rolls up like a hot dog bun and collects water. I have since put 2 sticks inside the edges to keep it open. The nice bright colors faded within a week of being in the sun. But, it was only $15."
4,Cozy. Real real cozy.,"This hammock is great. Brought it camping with me to Havasupai, AZ and slept like a baby under the stars. My only complaint is that the cords that are included are pretty much a complete joke. They're like bathrobe sashes. Once they rubbed up against a tree for a couple of nights they were done. Going to buy some nice adjustable straps for this."
4,"Well made, pretty comfortable","I actually prefer the woven-rope type with stretcher bars, but our young dog considers them chew toys and they are a little bulky to roll up and carry in and out of the house.This one is very light and hangs properly on the hooks for the previous rope hammock. (I had been a little worried about the hanging arrangements after reading about Mayan hammocks and getting the impression they needed a longer hanging area.)A little harder to get into than the stretcher-bar type, but still OK. Doesn't conform to my body as well, but still OK. It beats the heck out of having no hammock at all or lugging one with stretcher bars around."
4,Texsport La Paz Hammock,Great product. Very comfortable and won't leave web pattern grooves in your skin like net type hammocks.
3,Texsport La Paz Hammock,"The fabric feels great. It's a bit short in length. Not for a big person. Some of the strings have already popped within first usage, but I tied knots in them. We'll see if it makes it through the summer. But you can't beat the price, so who cares!"
4,Completely satisfied,"I have been wanting a hammock for a long time now and all of them seemed financially just 'out of reach', so have gone w/out, 'til I purchased the Texsport La Paz Hammock. I absolutely, completely just LOVE, LOVE, LOVE my new hammock. It's light weight, easy to install and beautiful in color. I've taken many naps already in my new hammock! The price just can't be beat either! The quality of this hammock is just amazing. I also like the fact that it comes w/it's very own matching denim carrying bag, so you can take it w/you anywhere you go! Kudos to you Texsport! :)"
4,Good so far,"This was the best-reviewed low price hammock and I am pleased with my purchase. No complaints so far. It was easy to hang and hold me and my daughter (and her puppy) at the same time, comfortably. I take it down before it rains so I can't attest to how well it would hold up if left in inclement conditions. I'm happy!"
5,"Great Hammock, cant beat the price",I just love this hammock. I set it up on a standard hammock stand that i picked up at a yard-sale. I weigh 215 lbs. and its plenty strong. My two year old son loves to climb up on the hammock while im on it. Hes another 35 lbs. No problem for the Texsport Hammock. I never leave it outside in the direct sun or rain. I just use hooks and take it down when im finished. Tip O' the day. Stick a standard pillow at the head end before you climb in. HEAVEN!!
1,Doesn't work for adults,This hammock seemed like an inexpensive option for outdoor lounging but isn't. Does not hold a 200lb adult or a 120 lb teenager comfortably. Also when kids try to get in it it pitches them out onto their heads. Not a good idea.
2,Color Not As Advertised,"The hammock that I received was orange and yellow, not as seen in the photo."
1,"rough material, too small",This hammock went straight to Good Will. The fabric was super rough and it was very small.
4,You get what you pay for - Caution big guys.,"I bought some of these hammocks to use for a week at the summer house. I'm 6'2"" and it's a little small to get totally comfortable in.. need a pillow or your head's on the ropes. It worked fine for the week then we packed up and came home. The second year I used it for a couple days and then suddenly went right through to the ground. Over the winter they were stored inside a warm dry house, but the fabric is just weak."
4,Good Deal,Good price for a good hammock. Pretty colors and worth the money.Material seems durable but haven't used it yet. Fast shipping.
2,"Useful as a supplemental workbook, but not on its' own","This book may be useful as a workbook for those who need to thoroughly outline a project they're doing(if they already know something about Web-Based Training). Better yet, teachers of WBT/CBT or Instructional Design might use it as a workbook for student projects. It is not, however, a good place to learn about WBT--not on its' own. A more comprehensive primary text is a necessity."
1,Less useful than most books on this subject,"This book is a disappointment. The actual content is slim. The book has lots of white space, lots of self tests for readers, lots of blank charts for the reader to fill in as he or she plans a course, lots of bulleted ""to do"" lists. But it provides virtually no supporting information for any of its points or suggestions and offers no sense that Dl is actually a pretty complicated subject. In addition, it offers no references, bibliographical material, or any other support for the readers' continued learning."
2,"Well Filmed and Produced, but flawed like Don Trump...","Firstly, Donald Trump DID NOT start theunderrated United States Football League,which I played in briefly back in the'80's. The New Jersey Generals were 1stowned by J. Walter Duncan, who sold the6-12 team to Trump on Oct. 3rd, 1983,after the 1st USFL season had been played.The rest of this film is a [...]fest that relies on Trump's quirky ('I don'tlike to shake people's hands' schtick). Trumpis an egomaniac of legendary proportions whogot his come-uppense in the fine ESPN 30/30film 'Who Killed the USFL', Mike Tollin.Touchee!"
5,MUST SEE DVD,Fantastic dvd packed with all the imformation you need for basic bonsai and a little bit more.Highly recommended to anyone interested in starting out in bonsai.
3,Thriving Bonsai - DVD review,"This DVD contains good information for bonsai enthusiasts, especially the beginners, and beautiful images. But the production is not so good. Bad audio, and doesn't follow a sequence of the videos from the menu. At the end of each chapter, it returns back to the menu, making it harder to watch the full movie. Anyway, great material for nature lovers."
5,A Very Good Bonsai DVD!,"This DVD is fun, educational, and artistic! With this video, I have become well versed in the world of bonsai in just a short time. I would definitely recommend this video to those who are considering bonsai as a new hobby."
2,Bonsai....or is it BONZAI,"The video covers bonsai basics, but in general seems rather amateurish and poorly done. I certainly did not find it worth the money ($24.95) I paid. Segues are poor, videography is fair to poor. Perhaps it was my copy? No, I checked with a friend, who also purchased it and was as equally disappointed. My friend is less ""vocal"" than I. This has no comparison to some of the other videos I bought in the U.K., from a televised garden show, which covered bonsai as a topic. Those were excellent and at the US equivalent of $14.95, were far better value.I would suggest that the word ""banzai, or bonzai"" would fit better, as it would more signify a bomb."
1,Bad poetry,"It's hard to believe that anyone bothered to publish a journal with such bad poetry, and even more remarkable that the journal stayed around as long as it did. Save your money. Don't buy this lousy anthology. Alyssa A. Lappen"
4,A good place to look first,"Facing retirement in a few years and wanting more insight than that provided by Continuing Care Retirement Communities themselves, I began my ""research"" on Amazon and found first Sylvia Sherwood's work. It nicely laid the groundwork for subsequent reading, summarizing and analyzing a variety of statistics as well as interviews with numerous adults living in the CCRC's studied. Though I found the research data, may I say, limited, in that it dealt with a relatively small sample of communities, I have had no reason to doubt the conclusions drawn. It is a small, manageable text, which is a plus, and I am pleased to have it at hand in my library. However, there are broader and deeper studies available."
1,NO LO COMPREN!!!!!!!,"PORFAVOR, NO COMPREN ESTE CD DE LIBERACION. ES DE LO PEOR. YO NO LO E ESCUCHADO NI COMPRADO Y NO PIENSO EN COMPRARLO PORQUE ELLOS PIENSAN QUE COMO HAY GRUPOS QUE ESTAN PEGANDO CON EL PASITO DURANGUENSE, ELLOS TAMBIEN PIENSAN QUE ELLOS TAMBIEN VAN A PEGAR, PERO ESTAN MUY EQUIVOCADOS. ESTE CD LE DA UN MAL NOMBRE AL PASITO DURANGUENSE Y A TODOS LOS GRUPOS Y MAS AL ESTADO DE DURANGO. YO SI FUERA DURANGUENSE ESTUVIERA FURIOSA DE VER UN GRUPO QUE NI SI QUIERA ES DURANGUENSE TRATAR DE HACER EL ESTILO DURANGUENSE. PERO ME RIO DE ELLOS PORQUE NO VAN A PEGAR CON SU CANCIONCITA Y MENOS SUCD. PORFAVOR, NO LO COMPREN."
4,The Best of the Worst,"Here we have 1 of Keaton's ""Best"" sound films at MGM. While I beleive that ""Speak Easily"" is the best talkie Buster made at MGM, ""Parlor, Bedroom and Bath"" is not that bad. ""The Passionate Plumber"" is a dull film that the overbearing Durante dominates. The transfers are good, all coming from 35mm elements. While ""Parlor, Bedroom and Bath"" is PD and has been issued before, this print is the best I have ever seen. ""Speak Easily"" and ""The Passionate Plumber"" were both issued on Laser Disc, but the print used here is much improved. All in all a good buy for twenty bucks. My only gripe is why did Warners issue the remaining films seperatly?"
4,All Our Children,"So many of our children experience violence in their homes and communities. I've heard James Garbarino speak several times and he does have a pulse on what is happening and ideas on what we can do about it. For anyone working with youth, buy the book, read it, and then do something more to help your own community."
3,A little Wobbly,The stand is very heavy and uses metal pipes as the frame. This allow you to fit it together fairly easily but if you are not careful it will also be very wobbily. Make sure the pieces are all pushed together completely to avoid this.
5,Perfect!,The hammock stand was extremely easy to put together. I feel completely safe using it. I've had the hammock stand for about a month now. So far no complaints from me. I would highly recommend.
3,"Sturdy, Heavy, Reliable, Expensive, Large",Great product if you have a spot to put it permanatley. Will not work great if you plan to put up and take down often. Would have liked to know the proper demisions and weight prior to buying. Needed to a little tweaking on it to make it work for us. Not quite worth the money. Though it is very tough and strong. Very heavy duty!
2,Textsport Hammock Deluxe Stand,"The end of one of the tube is badly rusted when I opened the box. It is getting worse after couple of rains. Even though it is sturdy for two people, since nothing fasten it together, just plug in each ends, it's easy falling apart when moving it. It's O.K if you leave it in the same spot."
4,"Almost perfect, missing a part","I love my hammock stand. I just wish it had come with all the parts that were paid for. It was missing one of the chains to hook up the actual hammock. Other than that, no problems here!"
5,The Best Articles (Without the Ads),"Great writing, aritcles and beautiful pictures. I love Midwest Living Magazine, but sometimes wonder if I'm paying more for the ads than the acutal articles that appear. This book features great writing (the article on the Spring Green Wisconsin't House On The Rock) and destinations that sometimes get overlooked. (Good test: Read the articles on places that you've already visited. In some cases, they make you want to go back for some little detail you missed.) Well worth it just for reading pleasure, and planning those odd, offbeat vacations that are memorable."
3,3+ (the plus is for Murphy),"I can't believe the reviews here. It's true Norbit was not classic Eddie Murphy but it is mildly entertaining. The trouble with a comedic brilliance is that once you've reached the top, everyone expects every word to be hilarious. It must be impossible to continue working when everything you do is tainted by what you've done. This is a slick made for money and gimic type movie but Eddie's Work in it is fantastic is dumbed down by the script.In the age of reality tv, I'm happy that they are still offerings like this.I found it more entertaining that I did Coming to America."
3,Background noise! With todays technology?,"I really enjoy Randy Newmans songs. I grabbed this DVD when I saw it on the shelf, I had to have it. Imagine my dissapointment when I listened to it. The background hiss is absolutely terrible. I know technology was not as good back in 1983 but come on! With the way technology is today, and the remastering of older recordings being what it is, whoever produced the sound for this disc should be ashamed. I am using the Bose Lifestyle 35 system to play it on and it sounds like ... Other than the bad sound the disc is great (good selection of songs). Maybe they should Remaster it and send new copies to all who bought this copy."
1,Terrible sound,"I was really disappointed with this DVD. I've never seen Mr. Newman live before (and probably never will, living in Norway). The sound is so bad. No matter how much I love Randy's music, there is no way I can recommend this DVD."
3,A portrait of a genius.....with really bad recording equipment,"Randy Newman is a genius, and this DVD would be a gem if it weren't for the tinny recording sound. Very poor in that regard. But during the songs, you forget about it for the most part, because they are so great. Linda R. singing ""Real Emotional Girl""? My goodness, that is magic."
4,Lonely At The Top,"On this DVD Randy Newman is in great form with classics as Political Science and My Life Is Good. The ironic and tragic songwriter is joined by Linda Ronstadt and Ry Cooder, but that does not bother Randy as he plays the songs anyway. Now if we had a DVD of Ry and the Chicken Skin Revue that would be even better!!"
5,Great show,"Mental is an excellent show. It is very reminiscent of House, but is much more positive. The main character is unorthodox and has a slight problem with authority and some rules. He is also extremely enthusiastic and joyful which is very refreshing in with how much sarcasm is on TV now."
3,"Great show, but only 13 episodes",And for $36 dollars that's not a very good deal. Most shows are about that much for twice as many episodes... Buy it off of itunes for less...
1,Mental: The Complete First Season,I didn't enjoy this new series and it will not remain in my DVD Library.
2,"Poor Man's ""House""","An obvious, cheap rip off of the TV series ""House"", this show devolves into caricature and shows a complete and total lack of understanding of what makes ""House"" so wonderful and unique. Especially horrible is the portrayal of professional women in a psychiatric setting... so totally inappropriate you can't help but cringe every time one of the bimbos simpers into a scene with her boobs hanging out. ""Awful"" is the only word for it. Pass this one by."
4,Pleased with product,It serves the purpose for taking photos. I still like having photos in my hand rather than on-line.
2,J.R. Johnson,"I have experience some difficulty with this camera feeding film and rewinding. On the first roll I shot, the film got stuck at the end of the roll. I was able to rewind it by pressing the automatice rewind button. The pictures came out okay!Additionally, the snap the holds the battery door on the bottom of the camara doesn't work well and the batteries keep falling out. I had to tape it shut. Overall, this is a low quality camara."
5,Logan gets his own series,"It was a gas to read these issues when they originally came out, as Wolverine is my favorite Marvel character. If you feel the same way about the fiesty Canadian, or simply want a good collection of Marvel stories about one of its increasingly iconic characters, then buy this book. You won't regret it."
4,Graphic SF Reader,"A nice cheap collection of the beginning of Wolverine's run as a character popular enough to hold his own as a solo character. His adventures and wandering aren't too bad at all, and a good way to recover these easily.Generally speaking, this is not the X-Wolverine."
2,Defective full tone transfer,Solid black graphics come out mottled on last catridge I bought. Return/warranty process to unwieldly to execute so I'm keeping for text printing.
3,Informercial,"The photograhy was beautiful, the houses plush and inviting, but the book read as an informercial for the interior design services of ""friends"" of the authors. I think Carr and others have done just as good of a job or better,and their books are more reasonably priced.The book was reminiscent of tourist phamplets, beautiul pictures tooting virtues limited to a selected service, in this instance a few ""designers."" Ideas were limited, and represented a selected ""Mexicana Style."" One house looked much like another as the architecture was similar or the designer was the same. Not represetitive of Mexican design. It was a pity, I expected more."
4,"Great photos, you'll see them in his other books...","So whilst I loved this book, I was a little peeved to see that some of the photos were reprints from other books that this photographer has done. I was hoping for completely new ideas.However, saying that it truly is a wonderful book, full of inspirations and delights to get those creative juices pouring."
3,Just a little difficult,"I really love the look and feel of this seat, but there are a few glitches. I find it difficult in general to put my daughter in this seat. Once I set her in it, I have to reach under her to get the crotch buckle...it won't stay out because of the padding on it, so every time I put her in, I can't hold it out of the way. I wish I could remove the round pad over the buckle altogether, and I'm frustrated that I can't. I also find that the harnesses tangle a lot, and I'm constantly straightening them out and straightening the pads of them, too. Another thing that bothers me is that the buckles don't ""click"" when you put them in, so I'm always second guessing whether or not they're in right. I also have some trouble unbuckling, too, because they don't come out right away. I don't know. I like the seat for its looks and safety, but it's definitely not the easiest seat in the world to use."
4,Excellent Car Seat!!!!,"Our first car seat for our son was the Graco Sung Ride. He outgrew this seat at 4 months. We decided on the decathlon because it was going to last him until he was 6 years old and 65 lbs. So the price was worth it to me. Our son loves this seat. He almost always at 8 months, falls asleep in the seat. The only Con that I have with this seat is that it is somewhat difficult to install if you are not using the latch. We have this seat in the back center of our 2005 Toyota Highlander and it fits great, but the center seat does not allow for latch installation. It was difficult to get the belts tight. Other than that, the straps are easy to adjust and tighten, and my son is extremely happy in this seat."
5,sophie'smom,"GREAT carseat. Comfortable for baby, she fell asleep in it while I was finishing installation. She used to scream every time we were in the car. Now she loves the ride and the view. She is still facing the rear but this seat is high enough so she can see out the window. Installation could not be simpler and this is the safest car seat I have found. LOVE it!!!"
3,"Love it, but...!","Our son is 6 months old now, and we bought two of the Decathlon seats for him when he was 4 months old (one for each car). I was so thrilled with getting these products that at first I didn't notice all the problems. I remember reading reviews about how easy it was to get the child in and out of this seat, but I must disagree. I strugle with the buckle every time and tightening the belts is plain impossible (rear facing)! And, now, after reading some other negative reviews, I see that I'm not the only one with that problem. At first I thought that maybe the belt got caught somewhere underneath the seat, but that doesn't seem to be the issue. If anyone has figured out how to work around these issues, please let the rest of us know!"
1,Returned it for a Marathon,"We had a Marathon with our oldest and LOVED it! I figured the Decathlon would be even better for our new baby boy. The pads were nice, but the straps were IMPOSSIBLE to loosen and tighten. My husband is a fairly large man, and it was difficult for even him to yank on them. He took apart the straps, re-threaded them, etc. to no avail. Returned for second Decathlon, to find the same problem. Finally returned for another Marathon. Again, LOVE the Marathon. Never looked back to the mess that was the Decathlon. Called Britax, they weren't helpful. Amazon bent over backwards to refund. Amazon's customer service, again is amazing!!!"
5,Wonderful!,"I recently bought this car seat for my 8 month old son. When it arrived, I took it out of the box and strapped my son in on the living room floor. He turned his head to the side and fell asleep! The material is so comfy to touch, I imagine it feels even better on his baby skin. It is a bit large, but we have an expedition and it fits perfectly. My husband and I call it the ""Barka Lounger"" because it is looks so inviting. We wish they made adult lounge chairs. We have been using this car seat for a few weeks now, and are very happy with it. I did a lot of research before I bought a convertible car seat, and Britax seemed to be one of the safest rated out there."
4,can anyone tell me?,i just started using this seat and i must admit i too cant tighten the straps the only way is to reach under the front side of the seat and pull the straps by hand then pull the front strap iam using it rear facing and it is really hard to get my hand under the front because the seat is in the way so can anyone tell me when i turn the seat front facing will this problem stop? will it tighten the way it is advertised to do (one gentle pull) or will i always be reaching under the seat?kinda outrages and unacceptable for a seat that cost approx 320.00 with tax and shipping britax tells me it will loosen up with time dose any one know if that is true?
4,"Seemed nice, but way too big","I just put this carseat in my car today. I have a Toyota Highlander and I can't see out the rear-view mirror anymore, so the seat is going back. I am very disappointed. It seems nice other than that, I just can't believe how huge it is, and my car isn't exactly small!"
3,Good car seat but we liked the Marathon better.,"I registered for this Decathalon because I thought the higher price tag would mean a better car seat. Wrong. My husband had a hell of a time putting this in our SUV. There were too many pads and contraptions that could have easily just been taken off but they didn't exactly explain this clearly in the instructions. Plus, everytime I put my 6 month old daughter in it, she would cry. She didn't like it and she was always slumped over when she fell asleep. I wasn't thrilled about the boring grey color and there weren't that many pretty colors that this car seat came in at the time, so I decided to purchase a Marathon in Olivia pattern for my SUV and give the Decathalon to my husband. My daughter LOVES the Marathon and won't cry anymore when I put her in. It gives you the option to tilt her further back so she's no longer slumped over when she naps. I like both of the car seats but for my next child, I'll be registering for a Marathon for sure."
2,Decathlon harness,The seat is very comforable and my 6 month old does like his new seat however getting him in and out is a nightmare. The strap is impossible to tighten. I have been searching the web to make sure that maybe it was just me not adjusting it correctly. I have found many others with this same problem and now that I have read that a fireman had a hard time tightening the harness I know it is not just my lack of strength. I plan on calling Britax. I bought the carseat through amazon. I am glad my son is comfortable but his safety is more important. I can't see it being safe when you can not secure him properly in the harness. He also tends to fall forward when he falls asleep. I have reclined it as instructed but it has not helped.
5,Perfect.,"I loved this novel, which is funny, because I didn't like the first Vampire Hunter D movie which was based on this novel. The movie cut out a lot of the information, mostly background and character information, which would allow us to understand and enjoy what was happening.We get a bigger picture of life, or what life is like, on the Frontier, in the Capital and in the year 12,090 A.D. First published in 1983, given birth by the author watching Horror of Dracula starring Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing, it still has a lot of punch. And for a vampire lover like me, I really enjoyed the setting, the characters, the plot and even the action scenes. A must for any vampire library.Warning, this is NOT a graphic novel or manga. This is a text novel."
5,New Perspective to Classic Horror,"The story takes place in the year 12,090 a.d. Humans and vampires or ""the Nobility"" as they are called are at war. Hunters roam the countrysides looking to rid the world of the wretched vampires. But one hunter in particular is more than he appears. He goes by the name of D and is both human and vampire, a dhamphir as they are called.D. befriends a beautiful girl Doris and agrees to help her and her brother Dan fend off a vampire who wants to turn Doris into one. What ensues are outlandish battles of demons, werewolves, and mutated humans.D. must fend of creatures of all power to save Doris and her brother. Read the Vampire Hunter D and you will find a horror classic before your eyes."
3,"Great worldbuilding, terrible writing","Great worldbuilding, terrible writing. I don't know how much the translation had to do with that, though. Gorgeous illustrations, of course, although the internal b&w ones are bit blurry and confusing. (Again, no idea how this compares to the original.) Under normal circumstances I'd only give this 2 stars, but the world and the flashes of real originality made this genuinely enjoyable despite the terrible writing."
5,Will admit not a shakespearian novel but a must read for fans,"Though I will admitt that this is not of course a novel written by shakespeare himself and obviously not a book for everyone, it was a good book. I have been a fan of D ever since I saw the motion picture in high school and have always wanted to read the novels. If you compare the movie to the novel though there is a quite a bit of difference between the two of them as there is always with movies that were made with books. So deal with it.The overall translation of the book was at most like any book that was translated not perfect. It does however have a one thing that the movie didn't, an overall persona of what the characters were thinking that could not be seen very well in the actual film. I have a feeling that if you truely are a fan of the movies you will however like the books even better. These are great books to read when it is raining outside or if you have nothing else to do."
4,"Don't see the movie, read the book!!!","This book was amazing, I'd seen the two vampire hunter D movies years ago, and they were okay, a nice story, but it most seemed about the darkness and gore rather than any real vampire mythology. They didn't leave a real imprint on me, except for a crush on D. On a whim I decided to read the book recently and I was utterly shocked. The movies are nothing like the books, the books are rich in myth, story , emotion and suspence, that the movies just don't hope to touch on. D is a very gripping character simply becuse you almost cannot like him...he's so cold, detached and almost heartless....but every now and then he'll do something so kind and privotal you cannot help but to like him and wonder what exactly does this egnimatic vampire/human feel...if anything.This book sets the scene very nicely for the rest of the series, in the movie Doris was so awfully clingy and annoying. However in the book she's MUCH more likeable, and self suffient."
1,Very Poorly Written,"While this could have been an entertaining read, the writing makes this novel impossible to enjoy. This novel is severely lacking in character development...I didn't care at all about any of the characters. The plot is predicatable, and slow paced. Basically, I found this book a chore to read."
1,The Latest Sleep Aid,"First the good news: the title is great, so is the picture on the dust jacket.Now for the bad news: this book is boring and depressing beyond belief! I recommend it as a highly effective sleep-aid."
4,Honest journalism,"Sex trafficking is a serious issue in many areas of the world, including the Heera Mandi neighborhood of Lahore Pakistan, and it must sometimes seem as if a few small changes should be able to stop it. When Louise Brown, a researcher on sex trafficking around the world, travels to Heera Mandi, she realizes that the issue may be more complex than she had originally imagined. This is essentially a journal of her repeated visits to Pakistan over a number of years. She follows a number of characters, but the undisputed star of her study is Maha, a fading dancer in her thirties who is trying to keep her daughters from following in her footsteps. As time goes on, Brown becomes more involved in Maha's life and less of a casual observer - but she remains an excellent narrator throughout."
3,Compelling but Ethically Troubling,"The book is well written, with turns of evocative turns of phrase that readers of travel-writing will appreciate, conjuring up the sights, smells and feeling of the old city of Lahore. However, I also cringe at the way Ms. Brown writes about her subject and wonder if her subject had been given the opportunity to read (or have translated) *how* she was written about, if she would have consented or not. In this sense, the book feels a bit exploitative to me - a Western academic making a name and some cash for herself by allowing western readers to be voyeurs into the life of a woman who while at times portrayed sympathetically, is generally portrayed as selfish and a bit histrionic. It's a good read, but I felt a little dirty after finishing, as if I'd just watched in on the confidences of someone else's life that I didn't have permission to see."
2,Great MiniDisc Player... but you better read this...,"This is just a MD player. I want you to make sure that you understand that this does NOT have the recording of mini-disc's built into it. If you do not have a recorder at home you are going to have a useless player. As for the system here, its great, it sounds good, and its got a remote control (that you will not end up using, it fits in a pocket). However, if you are looking for a recorder/player or just a better player, go to your local electronics store and pick up the Sharp MD-MT15. It is by far the best mini-disc player/recorder on the face of the planet, great sound quality, great support, easy recording, and lots of great features, even fast play and mono-recording for double the storage on a mini-disc. AND the MD-MT15 supports 24-bit playback!"
3,LongTime Owner,"I'm suprised this model is still on Amazon...I bought this model almost two years ago, and I still am using it (though I'm in the market for an upgrade).Here are some things not so good about the model:* First there is no lcd display on the actual unit. So you really need to have the remote to see things like battery usage, if the power is turned off, and also to do things like choose play modes. I left my MD in my car one day - and the sun half melted the remote (silly me) - it's hanging in there even still - but once it finally goes..... I'll need a new remote or a new player* My unit tends to skip if I put it on my waist belt and jog - I hate that. If I hold it in my hands - no problem. If I have it on the belt - and walk - no problem.* Battery usage is excellent. I get better mileage from what is advertised (over 16 hours).I certainly wouldn't buy this model - there are new ones on the market for the same price or less. It is a good player though."
4,its good product,"This mini disc player is very good. The menus and features are very easy to use and i comes with an optical port for 100% digital recording. I recommend this for anybody wanting a mini disc at a low price. BUT!>> if you want a mini disc player with 5 stars, it must be sony! they made the technology and they are the best at it."
1,Bad sound and Horribly slow recording times,"By far the worst md player built. look to sharp, for the features done right. Jvc has a long way to go."
2,Why not complete??,"Ealing fouled up on this release. Don't get me wrong the transfer is beautiful having used 35mm elements, but it's cut. I bought a VHS copy of this film years ago that was taken from a 16mm TV print, and that was also cut but it had the missing footage not included in the DVD. My only thought is that a censored copy was used editing out anything that might be offensive. This copy runs 66 minutes. If you add the missing footage that's in the VHS the complete running time should be 71 minutes. Hopefully Ealing will soon release a complete copy of the classic film."
5,BEST WHEEL CLEANER EVER!!!!!,"I just used this wheel cleaner for the first time on my motorcycle and i cant even begin to explain how awesome it is...My rims are painted white and i was always hesitant to use wheel cleaner on them because of acid's and what not, worrying about the paint being faded or stained...This stuff is safe on painted rims and i still cant believe my eyes...my rims look like they just came out of the factory with brand new paint...they had this black grimey tint from brake dust that i could never get off...i sprayed this stuff on, let it sit for a bit, wiped it off with a microfiber towel, and rinsed...the stuff came off like it was nothing...i'm truly amazed by this product and WILL ALWAYS use it on my bikes..Trust me you will not be dissapointed on what it can do..."
3,Gripless cane,"We bought this cane to try to replace the type we usually buy. The lack of a grip is an issue and we will not purchase this cane again. The grips on the style we usually buy have been falling apart and turning ""sticky"" so we thought it would be worth trying one without a grip. While it is a personal preference, the lack of grip is hard to get used to."
3,Skips while jogging,"Although this Discman purports to be ""skip free"", it did indeed skip quite a bit on me while it was sitting on the console of the treadmill I was jogging on. If you're just walking, it's fine, and the sound quality is very good."
3,Good-but unreliable,"This discman is compact,affordable,has nice features,saves batteries but is iffy on the quality my units top broke off after only 1 month! and thats with good care my cheaper lennox and sanyo players lasted from '94 lasted longer my advice dont write off but consider the quality before you buy - end"
5,This Book Answers Some of Life's Toughest Questions,"Creator of the Alpha course, Nicky Gumbel answers fifteen critical QUESTIONS OF LIFE. As he explains in the foreword, ""This book attempts to answer some of the key questions at the heart of the Christian faith. It is based on the Alpha course, which is designed for nonchurchgoers, those seeking to find out more about Christianity and those who have recently come to faith in Jesus Christ."" (Page 9) Around the world millions have attended an Alpha course.Gumbel writes in a straightforward manner using modern illustrations combined with Scripture to answer critical questions like ""Is there more to life than this?"" or ""How does God guide us?"" Whether you've been a Christian for years or never been a person of faith, you will find insight and answers in this book. I recommend QUESTIONS OF LIFE."
4,A good question and answer book especially for new Christians.,"In the ""Questions of Life"" by Nicky Gumbel we get answers to some of the most asked questions that a new believer or a non believer in God might have. In fact there are fifteen chapters. Each chapter focuses on a question, with an in depth answer. The author answers questions on topics such as how and why to read the Bible, who is Jesus, and how to resist evil. These are questions that I myself have often wondered about and felt like I was given fuel for thought with the answers I received in this book.Overall, I found this book was written in a down to earth easy writing style that was easy to understand, that will give the reader fuel for thought. I think this book would be perfect for not only a new christian, but anyone looking for answers to some very basic but also very important questions concerning faith and Christianity.A complimentary copy of this book was provided in exchange for an honest review."
4,Great book for new Christians,The Alpha course is much needed for new and old believers in Jesus. Excellent for the many people who don't know who Jesus is. This book gives perspective.Anonymous
1,"little insight, mostly posturing","I wanted to like this book: but often asking writers such questions brings on words that are not spontaneous and that though they may be competent in intellectualism, they are impoverished in beauty and in gutsiness, which is the kind of writing that truly sings. Since time to read is limited for most persons, it might be good to read the original materials and forget about the rehashed commentary. I would far rather see a diamond than read about one."
4,"Great pictures, uneven text","I agree with both the positive and negative reviews: I loved the pictures (as did the positive reviews)- they definitely gave me a better feel for concepts like ""pods"" that I am used to seeing from ground level. But I also think that some of Hayden's language was unclear, needlessly polemical, or both. For example, she writes that ducks (buildings that serve as advertisements) ""are always out of context and do little to unify neighborhoods."" But what does it mean for a building to be ""out of context""? How does a cheese shop ""unify a neighborhood"", whether it is ugly or pretty? Also, Hayden's points sometimes have little to do with sprawl- for example, she has an entry on ""Export Garbage"" but she does not explain why she thinks suburbs generate more garbage than cities.But on balance I liked this book, mainly because she spends only a paragraph or two on each concept, so even the text entries I would have written differently did not take up a lot of my time."
2,Mainly picked up for the pictures...,"I've heard many of the term before. Zoomburb. Big Box. Alligator. I guess that's what happens when you grow up in the house of an engineer. I figured this illustrated guide would be interesting to look at, so I picked it up. The pictures were only satisfactory, and some of the writing was above my head. I did learn lots of new terms though. However, I don't think I would recommend this unless you have some interest in land-use, urban planning, or architecture."
2,Average at best,"The book is very simple and somewhat boring. I looked through the thing in less than an hour and now it's stuck in the closet. It does have some good aerial photos, but only a few. I was hoping the book would be a coffee table book for people to look through when they are over but it's now in the closet for who knows how long. It looks too much like an encyclopedia than a coffee table book in my opinion. The text isn't very well thought out either. Believe me, I'm an Urban Planner and so I'm interested in this stuff and have read a lot about sprawl, but this book just doesn't do it for me."
2,Of no interest to Black Belts looking to implement DFSS,"This book may appeal to middle management or executive level managers who are taking a first pass at DFSS and are not familiar with Six Sigma in general. Frankly, this book is a waste to time if you are looking for a meaty how-to on how to implement design for six sigma at your company. The author keeps telling the reader about the power of DFSS but lacks the substance to get you there. It is written as if it were a lengthy abstract to another textbook.If you want to buy a gift for your boss--you're all set.If you want a useful reference volume on DFSS look elsewhere.SeanASQ Six Sigma Blackbelt"
1,OK intro for total novices but teaches you virtually nothin,"That book is good for a coast-to-coast flight. Has virtually no substance, can't learn anything from it. Has some value for novices. Misassigned quotes, incorrect dates, off the cuff graphs, fluffy fluff.Borrow it from a library, do not buy for you bookshelf. If you have a backwards looking manager, buy it for him as a gift."
3,Apply appropriately,"An easy read that provides a 50,000 foot view appropriate for management or a non technical staff.Strong on concept and short on substance - properly applied, this is a good reference for those not requiring substantial methods for implementing a DFSS strategy."
4,Good for a start,"The video's comprise some of the first season of Doctor In The House. I feel there should have been more available and would really have liked to see the entire set of Doctor series available.However, they are funny, I just feel there are actually more humourous episodes than the ones they have compiled."
3,Nice Hardware with somewhat outdated map,"Overall I'm very pleased with the GPS unit. It works nicely as my auto navigator. The software interface is also very easy to operate with little need to refer to the manual. The map, however, seems outdated for at least 1-2 years. There are times I was misguided because of that. I'd like to see another update on the map. I'm not sure if it's possible but if the GPS unit can take a 3rd party software it would be perfect."
5,An eminently readable functional analysis book,An eminently readable functional analysis book including an appendix on measure theory and probability spaces. The text covers the material without explicit development of the Lebesgue integral. The notation and typesetting are very clean and the section on spectral analysis is unusually good. The proofs are very clean and complete with numerous illustrative engineering examples and diagrams. I recommend this book for graduate level engineering students.
1,why didnt you ad this in the product discription?,"I bought this game not knowing that it can only be played on a 800x600 monitor,I have a 22in monitor and when I change the resolution it still does not play,I wish this info would have been available to me .Therefor I cannot reveiw this game ,I cant play it!!!"
4,excellent,"The driving guitars and pounding drums on this Hopewell album keep this from being true space rock or shoegazer music.But there is a distorted, otherworldly hue to this band's hard rock, and with good writing and workman playing, this is solid.These guys are not going to go toe to toe with My Bloody Valentine or Slowdive, but if my description sounds up you alley, so is this album"
3,Hopewell - 'Hopewell & The Birds Of Appetite' (Tee Pee),"Admirable third effort from this neo-psychedelic outfit. Seem to recognize this CD cover from somewhere. Either way, I decided to give it a spin. Cuts I found somewhat inspiring were ""Trumpet For A Lung"", ""Praise Twice"", the laid back ""Synthetic Symphony"" and the killer ""Hello Radio"" (has got to be the disc's best track, hands down). Line-up: Keven McMahon-vocals, Reno Bo-guitar & vocals, Rich Meyer-bass & piano and Mark Marinoff-sax & clarinet. Could pull in fans of Windy & Carl, earlier Spiritualized, Mercury Rev and possibly Flaming Lips."
4,Not as good as Graco; nice bells & whistles,"We bought this playard for my mother in law's house, but we have the Graco Pack 'N Play at home. The Madison playard's mattress is not as cushiony as the Graco, and it's not as easy to set up or take down. But the extra features, such as the roll down shade, are nice. The fabric is attractive.A week after getting this one, we bought a playard for my dad's house, and we decided to go with a Graco."
5,Awesome!,I just love this pack n play! It served as our cradle for the first few months of my baby's life because he wouldn't sleep in the cradle!
2,Poorly Made,"I purchased this playyard because I loved the print. The bassinet sways so my son slips to the middle. The first time I took it down, the fabric ripped away from two of the snaps. Rather than call the manufacter to replace the bassinet fabric I purchased the Eddie Baurer deluxe musical playyard, a little more money but made much better."
2,Is it really made safe?,"I received this item at my baby shower & I love the color & design but when I went to go put it together, one of the black clips that holds the bassinet in place, the fabric loop came right off, like it was not properly made. If it ripped off that easily just by putting it on then I would not feel safe putting my child in there either.I was very disappointed but Babies R Us was nice enough let us do an exchange for something else so before we purchase another one we are going to look closer at how they are designed, for safety."
4,Overall - good book.,Just finished reading Successful Real Estate Investing and really liked this book. I have read numerous books on Real Estate and this is one of the better books I have read. Very informative and up to date. He really debunks the tv Guru's and gives you the nitty truth about what it takes to get into the market. He is also very conservative in his approach and tries to give all angles to buying property. Give this book a four out of five stars.
4,Good reference guide.,"I have been reading many real estate books recently and this one is the one that stands out the most. This book is a very good start for beginners who are looking to get into RE investing, either as a full-time job or something to do on the side. This book takes you through most of the detail needed to accomplish these and other tasks: writting an offer letter, tenant management, rent control understanding, etc.The book also covers area of mortgage negotiations, tips on how to be able to show profits without paying taxes immediately and other tips of the trade.I recommend this book over many others who preach their seminars and other non-RE related topics."
1,Poor DVD quality.,"DVD is poor quality, I need to return it cos it freezes. We only watched it twice. Content is good but they need to use better DVD."
5,It certainly does,"Successfully concludes this family series. If you'd love to learn more about the family, the books are a great read."
3,Just an O.K. movie,"The reason I ordered this movie was to complete the set of ""Love Comes Softly"" dvd'sthe last movie being nowhere near as good as the first ..but that is usually for most series ........but if you already have the other DVD's you need to complete the set!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,clicheclichecliche,Too predictable and cliche ridden. Not enough conflict. Overly sweet. Oke robs the story of real tension.
3,"Better than Love Takes Wing, but that's not saying much","I bought this because I own pretty much the whole series (with the exception of Love takes Wing, which I found to be particularly bad). The poor leads from Love Takes Wing are also stars in this, but do a slightly better job. Story is sweet of course, but it's disappointing that the quality deteriorated with each sequel.For those who love the series, this is worth a watch. If you don't - don't bother."
5,Wonderful DVD,I have eight DVD's of stories by Janette Oke and each one is excellent. Every one should have these in their collection because they are clean and exciting.
4,GOOD MOVIE!,You can't go wrong with any of the Love Comes Softly movies - based on the books by Janette Oke! Good CHRISTIAN film.
2,A disappointing conclusion to the 8-part series,"My family enjoyed the first seven movies in the ""Love Comes Softly"" series but we were not pleased with the eighth and final episode, ""Love Finds a Home"". The story line and the acting left much to be desired. There was very little connection to the previous episodes and there was no real ending to bring the series to a logical conclusion (the movie just ended and left you longing for some form of a thread that tied the generations of this family together). We will most likely watch the first seven episodes again but I doubt that we'll waste our time with the final episode."
3,Meh,"I like the Old LBC better. Their style has changed a lot, however the CD does have some good and meaningful lyrics. So if you like pop-punk then it is worth checking out."
5,"Lucky Boys Confusion's ""Commitment"" to Rock a Success","I heard of Lucky Boys Confusion, but never their music. That is until Tuesday when I purchased their 4th and latest release, ""Commitment"". I am a girl who loves to hear different sounds of alternative. Did I ever! A couple of songs remind me of Queens of the Stone Age, The Strokes, but they still have their signature sound of reggae meets alternative, and I LOVE IT! The lyrics capture you into every song. Lucky Boys Confusion knows how to have fun, be serious, let loose, and just do what they do best...ROCK! I highly suggest purchasing this album as well as checking them out via internet, concert, or whatever."
3,not bad,"This CD is not as fun as their last one. It lacks some of the high-energy songs, and is a lot slower pace. It's not a bad disk but it doesn't fit my tastes."
3,congrats,"the three stars is only for the band and not the cd. i lovED lbc before this cd. now only one word really sticks out, hypocrites. congrats to the bossman, might as well be on trl."
5,Lucky Boys Confusion Comittment,"I've been listening to Lucky Boys Confusion for a few years now, and i have to admit that this is their last alubm yet. They have not failed to impress me once with their music, and their new album commitment is awesome. Although a little but more mature than the previous albums, this album is still very good and every single song is awesome."
5,A simply amazing album,"These guys are amazing. From ""dumb pop song"" off of their premier CD to ""hey driver"" off of Commitment, Lucky Boys Confusion has continued to hit their fans with a barrage of music, ranging from soft acoustic solos to mosh pit bashes. The variety of music compiled on this CD is not only unique, but truly amazing to listen to. If you have never listened to another Lucky Boys Confusion CD, this is an amazing place to start. Hey Driver, Sunday Morning, and Atari are wonderfully written and performed songs by this chicago band that will amaze and thrill everyone from their most dedicated of fans to the someone hearing one of their songs on a radio station. I HIGHLY reccomend this CD to anyone itnerested in the band."
5,Lucky Boys Confusion does it yet again!!,"I am a huge Lucky Boys fan, and I have been anticipating the new album for a long time. I think the new album has a contagious energy and just the right amount of variety. The lyrics are clever and will either hit really close to home or make you think ""I can't believe they just SAID that!"" Although the new CD won't ever replace ""Throwing the Game"" in all the hearts of Lucky Boys fans, ""Commitment"" is fresh and fun and offers a little something for everyone. If you like music period, I guaruntee you will love this CD!!"
5,"Amazing, Simply amazing","The boys never cease to amaze, and Commitment is definitely a testament to their progression as song writers. Their sound has definitely moved away more from the ska/reggae sound they had...but it's still there. Honestly, do not hesitate to pick this album up. Something to Believe, for lack of a better word is superb. Ordinary and Closer to Our Graves, again, amazing. Pick it up. You won't be sorry, just amazed."
5,I'm speechless!,"This CD is absoulutely the best effort put forth from a band at one time! The Lucky Boys got their start in Chicago, and I love them to death. In addition to the great 'Hey Driver', you have to take a listen to 'Broken', 'Beware', 'Closer To Our Graves', 'Atari', and of course..the title track 'Commitment. Infact, all the songs are worth listening to, but those are a few that stuck out in my mind after a first listen to the cd! Their lyrics are incredible! These guys have been working very hard, and it really payed off. This CD is going to be on repeat for weeks to come! Keep rockin, Lucky Boys !Be sure to check out other Chicago bands like my friends from my personal favorite local band, Starstruck! Take a listen at www.mp3.com/starstruck .. and check out their website, www.starstruckrock.com . Thanks! :)"
2,Disappointing,"I understand the cd has been released for a while now, and I have had it since its release. It just really disappoints me to see all these positive reviews. For someone who has been a big LBC fan since 1999, this cd really disappointed me. LBC sold out with this album and I just want people to understand that this is not the LBC that I know and love. LBC was at its best with ""Growing Out of It"" and ""Throwing the Game"". I really hope consumers look into one of those first because anyone who liked them then will agree with me, they sold out. I have never been more disappointed in a band.With that said, there are moments of greatness, ""Ordinary"" is one of my favorite LBC songs of all time and then ""Medicine and Gasoline"" is also a solid track.I hope that you consider this when looking at buying an album."
3,hilarious price,So I was in this band. I have hundreds of these CDs I'll give you for cost if you want. T-shirts too.Don't pay money for this. Especially not thirty bucks.
1,Wasted plastic gizmo...,"My stepdaughter had her mind made up that she needed to have this Barbie MP3 player for her happiness. I highly suspect that her stepsisters convinced her that this was the truth. After seeing one in person I couldn't really bring myself to spend over $50 on this cheap trinket. I tried to convince her that another MP3 player would be far more useful and durable, but of course that wasn't the point of this object , was it? She had already ventured upon the virtual Barbie world online and this also influenced her choice/need. Upon opening would not function and had to send back after customer service determined the base must be faulty. This christmas present is still not replaced as of 1/20/2008. I am hopeful for a positive result but what a hassle for junk. Mattel has been great about not adding any additional cost for me like shipping, but I did have to print the shipping label and spend time to have it repacked."
4,Barbie Girl MP3 player,"I bought it for my 8 year old who loves it. She loved opening up the whole Barbie World. She likes changing the outfits on the actual MP3 player too. Loading songs onto it was really easy. Not sure about the durability as we've only had it since Christmas. So far so good. Overall, I'd reccommend it."
2,Good idea but poor quality,"I bought this for my 9 year-old daughter who was mainly interested in unlocking all the features you get on Barbiegirl.com when you purchase this product. We've had it about a week and the headphones are broken (poor wiring connection in the plug makes the sound go in and out). A co-worker of mine is on his third as the first two had problems with the player itself. Also, the instructions are not great so it takes some trial and error to get it right (for instance, the CD you need to install is ""hidden"" in the base). Now, that's my perspective. My daughter still likes it and enjoys the expanded features on barbiegirl.com so she is more forgiving than I am."
3,Good starter mp3 player for very young girls,"My 8 year old daughter got this for Christmas. If you get one of these, don't pay more than $20 for it. As with most others she wanted it for the extra online stuff (a few extra items kids can ""buy"" with the B-bucks they earn playing games and ""movies"" on the site.), which is only good for a year from the time of registration. She has already lost the snap on pieces and the bottom of the player, and the buttons stick and skip over songs. On the positive side: it is very easy to get music onto it. It also has a clip on it so she clips it to a belt loop so she doesn't lose it or drop it. The earbuds it comes with have 3 different size ""covers"" so they will fit pretty much anyones ears."
2,Barbie Girl MP3 software a failure,"I am having the same problems getting the Barbie Girl MP3 software to function properly and work as advertised. I have no problem loading music on it. But trying to get the website registration software to work has been an absolute failure. It is a huge disappointment as a child's Christmas present. Its main function is supposed to be as a key code to unlock Barbie Girl website special features. Tech support for Mattel just hangs up on you because they are ""experiencing a high volume of calls"" all week and weekend. I bet they are. Amazon just referred me to another number, apparently for Broderbund software support, and they are closed on the weekend!I, too, am no computer idiot and my computer meets the specs. This is absolutely not worth any amount of money with these glitches and no tech support. This is all my daughter wanted for Christmas. What a mess."
2,About as cheap as they come,"My little one really wanted one, so I succumbed, and as soon as it came, I knew it wouldn't last long. The USB connector actually is ON THE TOY!! After less than 20 times of using, it has stopped working, the light has stayed on, and no computer will recognize it. I think for a child under 9 or 10, an inexpensive ""generic"" mp3 plyer from WALMART or online at Amazon would be preferable. One good thing is that hte volume is VERY low, which I think is a good thing for children to get used to."
4,Good First MP3 Player for young girls,"I bought this for my daugter's 8th birthday. She loves it because she gets her first MP3 player. As far as I can tell you can't download music from the internet, but we were able to download her CD's and she takes her Barbie Girl everywhere. The internet site is great for her age and very safe so far. She enjoys all the features and we haven't figured it all out, but for ages 8-12 I would say this is a great toy and for the price you do get a good deal."
5,Very happy with Barbie Girls MP3 Player,"Both my daughters wanted this item & I refused to pay the original price tag. When the price went down, I immediately jumped at buying it. I gave it to my 6 & 10 year old for Christmas & they love it. They had been playing on Barbie girls website for awhile & were not having any fun not being able to do all the things available. Now they love the site & play on it all the time. There favorite is having a pet & doing the makeovers :)As for the MP3 player it is very nice. The software is easy to install & it was easy getting songs uploaded to it. I was able to put all the songs they wanted on it & they still have room. My oldest uses the clip & clips it right to her jeans, it has been holding up well so far. It seems like a nice durable product!"
4,good player,"got this for my stepdaughter for xmas. she got to be one of the ""cool"" kids for the week, since it seemed like several other girls in her class got one as well. she wears the ""earrings"" and bops around the house (she's 8). really like the extra packs (and that they're not expensive) of accessories."
4,Great little MP3 Player,This is a wonderful little MP3 player. My six year old has no trouble using it. She has a MP3 penguin and it hooks up great. We have not filled it but so far it hold over 25 songs. She has not been on line much for the barbie website. It wasn't something she was interested. However it is a great little player perfect for younger children.
2,"Bad quality material, way too expensive considering what you've got","I am not satisfied with this toy in any way. It looks cheap, it doesn't show the playing song, there is no way of knowing what song is next.The sound is low. It is very expensive considering what you've got and 512Mb is way too little for the price. I purchase a 2gb minisd memory and the mp3 player won't work if the memory is inserted, so there is no way of using more than 512mb. I only purchased it because my daugther wanted so badly to use all the features on the barbie site but I don't think is worth the price."
1,A kid's review,"I got this as a Christmas gift. It worked wonderful. I just LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVED it! My sisters played with it, too, but they didn't bash it up. One day (today) I was charging it and adding some new songs. It said the songs were added, but they weren't!!! It said it was completely charged, but when I turned it on, I truned the volume up and down, I hit the play/pause button a few times, I even tried to flip through the songs, BUT IT JUST STOPPED WORKING!!!!!!!!!!! I am E-mailing Mattel today, this one is a cheap piece of junk. And the string that holds the clippr things FELL OUT!!! I am hoping a get a new, better, WORKING one."
2,Disappointed,"Horrible mp3 player. If my daughter wasn't so into Barbie, I would return this piece of junk. The snap-on outfits fall off easily. The mp3 interface is clunky and slow. To top it off, the software is all about getting your kid on barbie.com. If you want an mp3 player for a young child...look elsewhere."
1,the toy,"I had wanted this toy for very long and so my mom bought it for me , when i opened it and got my mom to help me with it cause i couldn't figure it out she couldn't either nd the directions where horrible and it literally does nothin who ever the personis who created it nice creation just needs WORK!!!!!!"
3,Pewter Scorpion Pendant,Not too expensive. Nice details. No defects. Speedy service. Can't really find any problems with this. I would probably do business again. No chain though.
1,Mr.I Don't Know,"Not at all satisfied with this product; you know you get what you pay for.I got no pad, not a single stich''''''"
1,Misleading photograph,"In the picture it has a carrying handle/strap. This is rubbish - the one I got had neither. I ordered it for one reason - to make it easier to carry. In the bag it is harder to carry. Out on the bag the screen has a handle, using the bag it has not."
1,Way short !,The zipper bag I recieved was approximately 56 in. in length which is way shorter than what is required for a 96 x 96 inch tripod portable screen.
4,A Must,This bag is a must. So much so that they should sell the screen with it included. Shame on them.
4,Case is well made,"The case is well made, The zipper is on half the case and the other half is sewn together, making it easy to get the slide and tripod very easy to get into the case."
4,zipper bag,"Nice bag. Should fit any make 70"" portable screen. FYI if your screen is 75"" you should be fine. I bout an elite screen which was total size of 75"" and it fit fine. A must have"
5,Prefect Fit,"Arrived on time and with damages. This is a perfect fit for the screen. However, I missed seeing the label that was shown on thw display. But, not a problem for me. I would recommend to others."
3,It's ok,"I thought the bag had a handle, it doesn't. I thought the the bag was the same width up and down it wasn't."
5,Easy to Understand!,"The presentation was easy to follow with good explanation of each position. I feel like I did a good work-out, and could take it at my own pace. Beautifully presented."
3,Cleaned first then used,"Before we gave this to our grandson, my husband opened it (the ability to do this a miracle in these times-kudos to Hohner for being able to do this) and found tiny metal particles on the reeds which he cleaned away. This is an instrument that is not only exhaled into but also inhaled. My husband cleans his harmonicas regularly so this was no problem for him. He likes the outer surface of this harmonica for kids because it had no sharp edges."
5,Harmonica,Hohner Kids beginners harmonica was a great Christmas gift. My great nephew hasn't put it down since he got it and actually can play pretty good.
1,Didn't last very long,"I bought this for my three year old son.. he loved it while it lasted, which was about two weeks... then it just failed to make any noise at all... I have upgraded to an adult model that didn't cost a whole lot more with the hopes that it lasts a lot longer."
1,"Save your money, Do not buy this item!","The software Pinnacle Studio 9 which comes with the set is very user friendly, HOWEVER, the quality of the final video in either 3 settings (low,med, high quality, options which u can choose to capture video in) is Awful. The analog to digital conversion box (hardware)is terrible. Video looks fine in a very small screen 360x480, however when u enlarge it to regular size (full computer screen) it is very grainy, choppy, overall very low quality, not suitable to be burnt on DVD or CD for archiving or for later to be watched on TV o r Computer.I even tried to capture MiniDV video using the Pinnacle 9 studio software and it makes the capture grainy, which shouldn't happen b/c minidv is digital. When I use software like Adobe Premiere its crystal clear. So the software capturing abilities and the hardware it comes with are terrible. I would never recommend this anyone."
1,Not your best option,"I first purchased this about 3 years ago. At first it worked but I could not get it to actually export the videos w/o locking up my machine and finally crashing. If you are going to be doing any type of video editing its ideal to have a top of the line machine. I have a 3.4 GHZ Pentium w/ 1 GB RAM. I would think that this setup would be totally sufficent to convert a 2 hr video from VHS to DVD. Unfortunately it wasn't. So a few months later I gave it another go w/ an additional 3 GB of ram.. in total 4 GB RAM.Now the program won't even recognize the Moviebox USB, I un-installed the drivers and reinstalled 3 times. The Movie box shows in Device Manager but shows as a blank space in Pinnacle Studio 9.I'd say don't waste your time. Its not worth the headache."
1,Some problems,I tryed to install in my computer and always presents problems to run the program and copy the movie from my cams.To me the product is no so good
1,studio 9,studio nine is awful too it capturing is rotten it has static even when you shorten your capturing time. And no support at all from pinnacle about the problem. Dont buy studio 9 either waiste of time too me.
5,Pinnaclestudio moviebox is the bomb,I purchased this product and love it. its user friendly and remarkably productive. I'm looking forward to anything that pinnacle comes out with. I'm a user for life.
3,Decent little knife,Lets get one thing straight this is no tactical knife..Way to small the blade is 2.5 inches.I was surprised it was really a G-10 handle all frost tactical knives i seen are cheap plastic that i wouldn't trust for anything but opening a box or something.This is a nice little knife for the price.Not up to a 50 dollar knife like the other reviewer said.But i would through this in my pack or glove box or even carry it in my pocket.I did have to clean and oil it right out of box and blade is cheaper 440 steel but it did come paper cutting sharp.So all in all not bad for the price its a sturdy little knife with G-10 for under 10 bucks..
5,great knife,"this is one of the best Frost Cutlery knives I've seen, it is nearly perfect.it literally works and feels like a $50 combat folder, for under $20.open and lockup is super smooth sharp as always and silent yep a real tactical folder.bottom line for under $30 this is a must have I sell them and they are solid."
2,wedgey toes,this pair of shoes have wedge-like front. i couldn't tell when ordering based on the pic available online.
4,KEEP YER FEET COOL!,"I have wide, hot feet. These shoes, with their perforation, are much cooler than regular tennies, which I have tons of. Now it seems I only wear these Pony's. Surprisingly, although they don't look like it, are very supportive because of the strategic canvas bands. The only reason I give 4 is because the sole tends to be slippery when you least expect it...i.e. on a waxed floor....Otherwise the sole is very grippy."
1,Complete junk,"These will fall out. Most pegs will either have a small bit of plastic coming up behind the shelf such that they cannot come out once you put the shelf in. Not these. Unless you do a pressure-fit into the hole (make the hole smaller than the peg), these supports will fall out. Not worth returning, but going straight in the trash. A waste of $$$."
2,Little!,Make sure you measure - these are really small and would not hold the shelves in my bookcase - I guess I didn't realize there were different sizes
4,classic improvement,"Better grip, some cushioning, not too large/draw resistant. Need to add some more words, so here you go. Worth trying."
5,Quite enjoyable,"To me, this is a very special cd. And of course it's scratchy, considering how old it is and how long it was probebly in some old damp storage room. It has a certain rustic charm very typical of the period. It's quite magical to hear all the old performers in one of my favorite G&S opera's. I recomend this to the g&s collector."
2,great for nostalgia I guess...,"I'm sure this was a wonderful preformance when first preformed in 1935, but this copy is scratchy and sounds to old to really enjoy. I also wonder of the quality of this CD since the whole three acts (minus the dialogue)are on one CD. I'm not overly impressed. For those of you who have never heard this opera it's hard to get a good first impression from this cd due to it's poor sound quality"
1,Poor quality,I expected more from a Rolodex product. The tray is very cheap looking and poorly made. I will not buy another Rolodex because of this purchase.
3,Slightly Damager,Product was scraped and scuffed up when it arrived. Not sure if it was damaged in transit or prior to being sent.
3,Sharp Viewcam - What was not clear,"The camera functions fine, except that it does not come with an AC input. The device can only be used with a battery. Since it's old, the batteries that came with it would not hold a charge, giving me only a few minutes of view time. I purchased the camera to computerize my home movies. To do so, I had to buy a battery and charge it after imputing approx 2 hours of video. I have over 30 tapes to input so it became more time consuming than I thought.The people I purchased it from sent me extra batteries but none worked. They stood behind their product. It would have been good to know that the camera was not designed to be used with AC power."
4,Sins of The Father,I enjoyed the book very much. Held my interest throughout; though sometimes it seemed a little repetitive. I would recommend it.
4,A Good Introduction to Folkloric Archetypes,"I loved Marina Warner's _Monuments and Maidens: The Allegory of the Female Form_, so when I saw this book, I had to have it. I have to say that I'm a little bit disappointed after _Monuments and Maidens_. I expected a more in-depth study. Instead, these six essays barely seem to scratch the surface of the topics. These essays are basically transcripts of six lectures Warner gave for BBC radio, which explains their brevity, but it's a shame she didn't expand upon them when she decided to publish them in print.Still, there are some very interesting things here. I would definitely recommend it if you're interested in folklore and are just starting your studies. For the advanced student, the book just leaves you wanting more."
5,Good exercise program,"I am already on the South Beach diet, so I purchased this kit to add strength training to my routine. I have been using the 8 minutes in the morning kit for two weeks now, and I already feel stronger. I like the kit a lot, because I am able to take out the cards I need for the next day and set them out with the dumbells as a visual reminder. My guess is that the book is harder to stick to. I didn't pay much attention to the CD, and the diet seems a little odd, but then again I didn't try it. I did tape a before picture and a motivational after picture in the little booklet that came with it, and that is really helpful. 8 minutes may not seem like a lot, and it really isn't, but it does add up to 48 minutes a week, which isn't too shabby. I think this program is a great easy way to fit exercise into your daily routine."
3,On week 2,"I am on week 2 of the kit, and I haven't seen any changes. I think that this program is really meant for persons who are really out of shape...I just wanted to firm up and lose maybe 5 lbs. The diet would probably be hard for people who overeat, but since I eat fairly well, I don't think it was much of a change from what I already eat.Even though I haven't lost any weight, I do plan on continuing the weight training. Haven't noticed any changes in muscle, but I definitely feel sore after some days...so it must be doing something!"
3,Sea Glass Chronicles,"Nice book with some pretty pictures but does not really contain much useful information about sea glass. The book ""Pure Sea Glass: Discovering Nature's Vanishing Gems"" contains much more information about the possible origins of sea glass for the novice collector."
5,A Stroll along the Beach ....,"Not only a 'must read' - but a 'must have' for those of us who carry the song of the sea in our hearts! This book takes you on a sea side stroll - admist the salted air with the caress of sea spray at your feet. C.S. Lambert's collection of sea glass is one of inspiration while Pat Hanbery's photography provides motivation to run to the nearest beach to begin your collection of those ever precious 'mermaid tears'! This is a remarkable, well documented journey into how important the sea has been in our history. All aboard!"
1,Disappointed,"In all of the time I have been purchasing from Amazon this is the only thing I have ever returned. I bought it with another book about sea glass which I did like. The content is mainly of pieces no one will ever find unless they are on an archeological expedition. It is devoted not only to sea glass but to fresh water inland glass. This lady found all of the pieces of a porcelain doll's head, how likely is that? She just is not a beach comber I suppose. The description is misleading. Don't buy this book if you are a SEA Glass collector."
1,Why did I buy this?,don't know why I bought this thing. I am missing its AC to DC inverter and its conection is so small that no other conveter will work with it. It's stuck in a drawer somewhere.
5,From Mission Impossible to Mission Possible!,"Never a real handy person with a drill, I was surprised to see myself using it and thinking about what else I can drill a hole to use for my fountain. I am working on my third fountain since reading this book four weeks ago.This is the best how-to book I've got so far. It makes you think of what else you can do besides following the projects in the book. The easy to follow intruction, the clear steps on how to solder and water-proof things you want to use on the fountain. It makes water-fountain building fun and easy!"
5,Great Book,This was a great book. I've already made my first fountain. Good steps to follow to make fountains. I plan to make more
2,Great Signal when it works,"I have had this router for about a year. In this year I am on my 4th router through RMA. All of them I can't use auto channel or channel bonding or AOSS. Even on manual channel with these other features off my router stops working about once a month and wont work for a few days. Then with the exact same settings it will start working again. My router is less than 10 feet from the devices trying to access it. I use this router for XBOX360,Wii, and DS so if your looking at a router for this usage look elsewhere."
1,The State of Atlanta?,"I have to confess I didn't get beyond the first map on page 9. That's because the map of the U.S. on that page has the following states bordering the Gulf of Mexico to the west of Georgia: 1) Atlanta, which looks oddly like Alabama; 2) Alabama, which borders the Mississippi River; and 3) Mississippi, which borders Texas.These simple and obvious mistakes did not inspire confidence in me for the rest of the maps on which I might not so easily spot the mistakes. Therefore I put this book aside and told my nine-year old that it was unreliable.Cary"
2,Not for kids,"The walker is attractive in colour and appealing to parents due to the educational wooden cubes, but it is not at all practical for the toddler learning to walk. Firstly it is very heavy so although baby can push it, they cannot turn it around, so they stop once they hit a wall. Also the section that has the rubber cubes in it has two people painted on it and the paint has come off onto the cubes. It has not been recalled, but not sure if there is lead in the paint or not, so now I will not let my child play with them. Advice for the new parent is to buy a cheaper walker which is more practical for the toddler learning to walk, such as the Vtech ones. The cubes are appealing, but you can always buy them separately."
5,My 9 month old son loves it.,My little guy just can't wait to walk and this toy allows him the stability he needs until he can balance a little better. It is the most sturdy of the walking toys and allows him to walk at a much slower pace than the plastic ones. We love it!
2,The sides come loose,"No matter what we did, we could not make the two wooden side bars stable. This includes handymen's multiple attemps, including tightening and changing the bolts and assemling the whole thing over again. The bar has never been sturdy, it moves as my daughter holds on to it. Also, it has zero manuverability. This looks cuter then the plastic ones, but I would go with a light and flexible plastic one."
4,best walker we've seen yet,"I like this walker. My one year old loves to walk behind it. She can't turn the corner with it but I haven't seen one my kids could do that with when they are so small. The soft handle is a good thing cause she just runs straight in the walls and doesn't hurt herself.Both my daughters love the blocks inside, they are great. Like others already said, my one big complaint is that it is so inviting to climb and doesn't stay up straight when she does. So I just watch her and keep her from climbing it. I like it much better than the plastic one we used to have, it always moved to fast and got away from them while they try to stand up."
2,Paint comes off wooden blocks,We purchased my son the Around the Block Walker that is distributed by the Parents company. The wooden blocks that came with the walker contain painted images and the paint comes off on the other blocks and on our hands. I called the company to file an official complaint and was told they would send me the same set of blocks as a replacement. When I explained why that DIDN'T make sense they stated that was their policy. Well the same set of blocks arrived and I just finished washing off the paint that is again getting all over everything. It should be noted they are not near a heat source. When I called this time they told me I would need to pay to ship the second set back - that being their policy. I am seriously irritated.
3,Good but not great.,"So far this has been one of the better walkers we have tried. The good points is it is sturdy so it won't turn over easy and it has been fun for my granddaughter to play with. Bad points is it does not turn well at all. We have to turn it for her. It is all so VERY heavy. She has fallen against it several times and since it is wood it does hurt. I would still buy it again because of how sturdy it is but know that it is a little difficult for them to really ""walk"" and turn with."
4,Great for little hands & minds!,I got this for our son for his first bithday. Right away he pushed the toy and screamed with delight. He couldn't turn it around (he was mad)and that would be the only dissapointment we would face. I love that there is a gap between the lids so his fingers cannot get crushed. My favorite thing about it is that it comes with 3 different types of blocks for the different ages/skill levels. The rubber ones are excellect for the first stacking tries!! He is now 17 months and is using it as a chair as well as a play toy. The soft cotton blocks he is currently using for a tossing game. This toy seems to keep having more and more uses! I would recommend this for the beginner/walking stages!
5,"Great purchase, many different uses!","We purchased this about a month ago, and are really enjoying it. My daughter is just 10 months old, and not quite walking yet. She very easily picked up how to walk while holding onto the wagon, and loves walking around the house. The wagon is cleverly designed so it is very hard (I'd say almost impossible for a child) to pull it over.She also loves lifting and closing the lids and putting the blocks in and out of the compartments. The blocks are really cool too - I especially like the rubber number blocks."
2,Not a good Toy,"We bought this toy for our 1 year old son. It is very sturdy and well made and the blocks inside are great. I agree with the other reviews that the wagon moves to fast on wood floors and it does not turn well.My biggest compaint, however, is that when both lids are closed, the wagon looks just like a 2-step ladder. Our son constantly tries to climb it, like stairs. The other day, he finally stood up on top of the wagon and the wagon tipped straight over onto the handle. My son fell over with it and crashed on his face. There are two rubber stoppers on the back of the wagon, but they DO NOT prevent it from falling over.My son is fine, but this toy is very dangerous and I do not recommend it!!"
1,Not worth the price,"I bought this sword thinking that I was saving money but soon learned that the sword is worth $120 (list price), not $450 (list price) which is claimed by this seller. This hustler is asking for $195.95 when the sword is worth $120 tops. Please check for yourself. The company that makes sengoku general katana is damascus."
4,excellent katana,I have always wanted a hand made Japanese katana preferably from Japan made by a master (this one is made in China go figure) but this is close to the real thing for now.....it is sharp maybe not to a Highlander standards though........
3,very good quality,"My daughter loves kids next door. The only reason I got this was because she wanted it soooo desperately bad. It is EXPENSIVE but it is also hard to find.The quality is very good though but I still think it is overpriced.My daughter loves it and is asking for the whole set.. if they had the other characters, I would definitely have to save for it or maybve consider making it myself to save me some money. Way pricey for a plush toy if you would ask me"
3,Enjoyable,"This is the first of the Chronicles of Mavin Manyshaped trilogy, which collectively are the prequel to the three books that make up The True Game. Here we learn something of Mavin's early life, along with her brother Mertyn and the Wizard Himaggery, and the plot is set up for the following two books in the trilogy.I certainly found this book an enjoyable read -- more so as a teenager than I do now -- but Tepper's style has changed a little in this and the other two Mavin books, as compared with the True Game trilogy. The plot is more straight-forward, lacking the interconnectedness which gave The True Game good re-reading potential; having read the book once, there is less to gain from reading it again."
3,Not Sherri at her best,While entertaining this book lacked the depth of Ms. Tepper's other works. I was a bit disappointed
3,Don't buy it if you own a Mac,"This dictionary is excellent. Superb. For many reasons, it's probably the best Spanish-language dictionary there is. But watch out: it does not work if you try to install it on a Mac running OS X Lion. I've had no luck trying to get help, or an update, from the folks who made the software."
2,Not the best for my needs,"I suppose it isn't bad as a dictionary with a bit of explanation, but in a ""Diccionario de uso del Español"" I'm hoping for more synonyms and specifics on usage, rather than just extended definitions."
4,"Very Funny, I'm Still Laughing!","I just got done with this book and i really enjoyed it. It is so freaken funny! I laughed so much. I loved Calvin, Jace, Tamera and crazy Jacob. A lot of twist and turns along the way that stayed to form. I loved the way the writer talked frankly about sex, reminds me of some of my crazy friends. I know this is a self published book so you have to give Mr Taylor a break as the editing job sucked, no doubt about it but was still better then any other gay fiction book that I have read in a long time. Hope there is a part two, would love to buy it!"
2,An unedited/proofed book,"So far, the story is decent, but literally every page has a glaring typo and/or grammatical error. It is embarrasingly bad!"
2,Pretty lame.,"We watched this hoping to see a little travelogue of Ireland. What we got was a film w/a very poor soundtrack, being hosted by an Englishman with an impossibly strong accent, interviewing drunk people in Ireland. It was good for a laugh because we could only understand about every 10th word. My husband and I have traveled quite a bit and don't normally have difficulty with understanding accents. Not so with this film!"
2,Unfortunate Purchase,It is surprising to me that the publishers would allow a book with this many blatent errors on the shelf. The typos alone are enough to detract from the message. The number of technical errors is unforgivable. I also wonder which *reader* took the time to write the author's autobiography as a review. Especially when the book was not yet available. I also think it is interesting that the only glowing reviews seem to have the same grammatical mistakes evident in the text...Don't waste your money.
2,Immature writing and low information density,"Admittedly, I was looking for a book targeted to professional programmers, but this book isn't really even good for a novice. The first section is virtually worthless. The second is better, but web resources are better, more thorough, and the information is much more accessible among the verbiage. I too bought the book based on the breathless 5-star reviews, and was offended at being duped. If you are a professional programmer then spend your time on the W3C or even the Microsoft websites. You'll learn what you need a lot faster and more accurately, not to mention cheaper."
2,A so-so book. I'll keep looking for a better one.,"I bought this book, a while ago, based on the glowing reviews it received from the first few reviewers. As others have mentioned since then, the book is replete with typos, very IE biased, and, most of all, I have found it lacking in information. In addition, I don't care for their overly cheeky style of writing."
3,Not well written,"This book lacks clarity . Looks very vague at times. The explanation on DTD makes the subject more difficult to understand. Unfortunately i am in no position to suggest a better book. For basic understanding of XML , IBM website is a good resource.The physical layout and apperance of the book is also a detterent."
5,Clear and Concise in True Hoodbhoy style,"Hoodbhoy comes from a family of Scientists and Engineers devoted to providing accesible tecnological solutions to the common man. His Uncle Pervaiz, a professor of Nuclear Sciences in Pakistan with a joint appointment at MIT has been the Narrator/Presenter of a science program broadcast on National television. His Father Samir, is the Director of a one of a kind institute aimed at developing locally developed solutions and manpower for Pakistans industry. Ceponkus and Hoodbhoy have really gone too lengths to make this ""manual"" user friendly and it is the one book that can teach you all of XML by itself. The only problem that as the book is very elaborate it is sometimes difficult to find how to fix small glitches specially those that the users makes themselves and the authors havent anticipated."
2,not very impressive,"I found this book just ok. Unfortunately I haven't found a single book on XML yet, that is good enough for professional programmers, so they can learn it quickly. I got impressed with the name of the book ""Applied XML"" and it's rating, and thought that is it! But I have got disappointed. Second as usual this book tends to be biased towards Microsfot technologies and IE as opposed to market standards."
2,"Poorly written, questionable organization","Although this book tries to cover a lot of useful information, the overall effort is poorly written, lacks coherent organization within each chapter, and at times rather juvenile. The youth of both authors is clearly evident and the book is better skimmed than read (often too painful to read). Oftentimes the authors put the cart before the horse when trying to teach a concept. Likewise, their examples tend to be rather weak and trivial rather than based on real-world usage patterns and scenarios. The authors' lack of professional experience in creating the kinds of applications that benefit from XML detracts from their overall ability to present the capabilities of XML in a professional manner."
1,Poor latch design,"Returned product. Latch is weak and poorly designed, would not hold the door closed. Architectural trim was not shaved and interfered with the door hinge. Amazon return policy is great."
4,Quality,"Quality mail box very well built, the only draw back is the door opening is not as large as the box so you cant get more mail in it."
3,"Looks great, works so-so","The mailbox is very solid and looks great. The door just doesn't latch properly. I suspect that with a little grinding and adjusting I will be able to improve things, but it seems as if the door is spring-loaded to open. Often when I return from work, the mailbox is open and the contents visible. This never happened with my old cheepie mailbox."
4,"Fein 9-11-55, 6 gallon Turbo Vac","This is my second Fein 6 gallon vac. I used the last one regularly for over 10 years in my construction business mostly as a drywall sanding vacuum used in conjunction with a Porter Cable 10"" drywall sander and hand mesh screen sanders. It received extra heavy duty working many recovery jobs after Katrina here in New Orleans and it was an amazing tool. After that punishment it began running overspeed and the repair was almost as much as purchasing a new one so I bought new Fein vac. (The same thing happened with the repair of my Fein Multimaster tool.) They have improved this model greatly over the first one. My only complaint, still no tool storage.When this one dies I will buy another one.Bud Logan"
4,"Great, except for those stretchy straps!","I agree with some of the other reviewers. Generally, this is a fabulous product. It not only serves its purpose for putting lotion on my dry, itchy back, but the vinyl is very soft and soothing. Unfortunately, the stretchy straps must go! For the price and the way it's used, this product should have strong, non-stretch rope straps. I, too, hold the ends of the vinyl instead of the straps to get the job done. I'd give 5 stars if it weren't for the straps..."
3,Hand Grips,The elastic hand grips hinder the application process. Non-elastic would change my rating to 5*s I use Albolene I can't imagine how to use a liquid without it spilling off the applicator.
5,Hindu traditions,"The book traces philosophical background of Hinduism with references to ancient literature- Bhagvat Gita, Mahabharata, Ramayana, Upanishads as basis for research.An analysis of religious life of the Hindus, its social impact is given too."
1,cheap made,The locking bolts do not stick out very far. The lock itself is very cheap feeling. No way would i trust this to pull a heavy trailer.
5,Good Nascar DVD,This is a great NASCAR DVD. There are two TV programs that showcase some of the greatest finishes and best drivers in NASCAR history. Both programs are a little over a half and hour in length and are very entertaining. The Bonus features on the disc feature 2 bonus races the 2003 Carolina Dodge Dealers from Darlington(Ricky Craven and Kurt Busch) and the 2007 Daytona 500(Kevin Harvick and Mark Martin). Both are about an hour in length and are two of the best finishes in NASCAR history and are probably the best part about the DVD.
4,NASCAR,"Okay - really, I don't like NASCAR, I think it is boring. But, I have a friend who loves it and I thought this would be a great gift, turns out I was right. He likes it."
5,Perfect density,This foam has a really nice thick density to it that helps keep the dust out better than the factory foam that comes with most PC cases.
5,Must-have!,"I foster cats for a non-profit organization, and everything gets fur on/in it. I bought 2 sets to cover up my side, top, and front fans. After a week or so I checked inside the computer for dust/fur, and it was just as clean as the last time I had cleaned it out. Very satisfied! Also, easy to clean without detaching the filters if you use some tape (like a lint roller) to pick up the filtered dust/fur."
1,waste of money,this looks like a piece of foam. if i knew it was like this i would rather go to a supermarket a buy a piece of foam. total waste of money
2,easily torn,Foam sheets easliy torn. Suggest covering with plastic mesh ie needle point crafting supplies for durability.Effective but not practible.
5,"Decorative, useful and needed.","This item is decorative, useful and needed. Well designed, it holds a large variety of spoons and utensils. Convenient hanger hole is nice for when not in use."
2,very nice and heavy but not white,"This spoon rest is a nice shape and nice and heavy like the Corningware bakewear. Now I wish I had gotten the two spoon version, but at least the old yellow melted on one side plastic spoon rest we have had for over 20 years is gone. The rooster and hen match my kitchen decor but the main color itself is beige/dark ivory/cream-just not white. The rooster and hen design in the bowl part is not like anyone would be able to tell anyway, just us cooks. Anyone will be able to tell it is not white like I know every time I am in the kitchen. I have never owned any Corningware this color- I didn't even know that they made any base color but white."
2,Not what I expected...,I have to say that I was rather disappointed with this documentary. There is another that is also produced by HBO (The Big Picture: Rethinking Dyslexia) that does a far better job of explaining Dyslexia in a way that feels interesting and tangible. Get that instead...
5,A must see for anyone with Dyslexia,"Powerful, enlightening, inspiring. This video moved us, and opened our minds. For anyone who suffers from dyslexia or knows someone who has it, this is a must. It will change how you think forever!"
3,Slight Disappointment,"I watched this on HBOGo. I was excited to learn more about dyslexia, which a did, but I also found that much of the documentary was talking heads trying to convince the watcher that people with dyslexia are smart, capable etc. I didn't walk away too enlighten. It's true that our education system caters to a certain type of learner, but the documentary did a terrible job of posing a solution. They could've done a lot more."
2,Disappointing,"This video was very disappointing. The footage was mostly just people talking and the perspectives offered lacked any real information. Maybe for someone who is unfamiliar with dyslexia this would be a good place to start. I got it to view with my daughter who is dyslexic, but after watching it decided against it as it really didn't offer any insight or information that she didn't already have. Not to mention it took sheer will-power on my part just to watch it to the end as it was rather boring."
4,Cute,"The pendant was small, but I liked it that way so that it wasn't obnoxious or anything.It's very detailed.I also liked that the string was adjustable.Although I don't recommend it was men... :("
4,"Great PIck, no color choice :(","These picks work well, the star hole keeps them from slipping if you have sweaty hands.My only disappointment is that no where does it say you only get one color, from the picture it seems as if you get 6 different colors x2 for 12 picks total, instead I received 24 yellow picks (bought 2 packs)I ass/u/me'd that according to the picture I would get 6x2 different colors o_0"
4,great picks.,these picks are great. they are much more controllable than most. I highly recommend giving them a try..
3,Good Show,"I orginally saw this as a Showtime Special back in the '80s. That special was great. Got to see everyone perform. From Hank himself to Earl Thomas conley, to Gus Harden, Mel McDaniel, Waylon Jennings & Jessie Colter, Dickie Betts & Alabama.This version is good but not great as it is edited with most of the performances removed. Don't get me wrong, it's a good show but it could have been great had it been released as it was shown on Showtime."
1,Use Caution!,"Listen up, I am only a ""once in a while user"" (pictures and easy things) and I have to say this product is a piece of junk. Today was the fifth, yes I said fith time using the auto level and the level ""eye"" froze in the front position of the product and would not level. It didn't even last 1 year of use. The stud finding is perfect, but don't waste your money, buy a $5 stud finder and not this. Also, if your walls are not perfect, you will have trouble leveling the level! I hate this thing! I have no suggestions, but don't buy this!"
4,Auto-leveling Laser with AnglePro,This item was purchased as a Christmas gift. I prefer Black & Decker products so think it should be appropriate for my son. It arrived well within the expected time.
1,"Not level, laser doesn't work","I just got this yesterday, and am returning it today. The first time I turned it on, the laser beam was on for a couple seconds, then disappeared. I cannot get it to come back on. I have switched the batteries, and still, nothing. The leveling backlight comes on, but not the projected laser.Also, this thing is so not level. If I line it up to where zero would be (if it were marked), it is about 5 degrees away from being level."
2,It's cheap,"Yes, it is cheap price and also cheap made. The device is made in China. The battery cover is so easy to fall off. The edges don't look clean.I don't know how long it would last but personally I expect higher quality from Black and Decker."
1,Very Dissappointed,"I bought this tool at Target with high hopes that I could hang pictures without the help of my never-available, handyman husband. It is impossible to read the leveling device and using the pin to hold it on the wall is impractical since it is damaging. My husband, who is very knowledgeable with tools, told me that I had wasted my money. Black and Decker, you have such great ideas. Please allow your engineers to design something that really works even if it cost more or takes more time to get to market!"
2,The AnglePro feature is useless,"While the auto leveling feature works fine (checked with a 4' level and a water level at 34'), the AnglePro function is off by about 3 degrees (at 8 feet it's off by 4"") which is plainly visible just by eye.I haven't decided if I'm going to return it or take it apart and see if I can adjust it. Also as already mentioned in another review, the center mark is very hard to see. I might try to paint it with thinned out model paint (if I don't return the unit)."
1,This thing sucks,"I purchased this from Home Depot, and I'm glad I did....because I'm going to return it. The gripes have to with the what others have mentioned.When switching the laser between the two sides, a straight line is not level. One side appears to be higher than the other.The aparatus to attach to the wall is good in theory, but does not lock the leveler from being able to rotate once attached (by magnet)."
2,On The Level,"If you are looking for a versatile tool, keep looking. The auto-level seems to work ok but the calibration for manually leveling is *way* off. There is no zero notation but if you center between the +/-15* marks you are nearly 10* off.The wall mounting device is a joke as well. First of all the quick mounting pin snapped off the first time I tried to stick it in sheetrock(before I had even put much pressure on it) and the magnet it uses to hold the level is barely strong enough under the best conditions. Trying to rotate the level usually results in it falling off the wall.Many small design bits are not well thought out. It feels like the designers never tried their own product. Maybe if B&D; does a couple revisions they can make this a useful part of a layout kit but it isn't nearly there yet.R"
1,usage is limited,"I bought this tool to install speakers at home and be correctly aligned to one another. This tool is poorly designed to stay in place and do its alignment. I ended up not using it at all.The pictures mention it's great to install frames on walls... it's probably the only usage I would see it working.Also, to make this happen, you have to install it on a wall, it comes with a big nail that will perforate your dry wall and leave a huge hole... You will have to do some spackling after you are done.I would recommend you pay a little more to get something decent... ($100+)"
2,I sent it back,"I sent it back. When I pounded nails into the wall, the vibrations would move the level and I had to constantly adjust it. I ended up using a regular level and sent the Black & Decker back for a refund."
3,Works well with 2 people,"This product does when it needs to. The features of the laster light being locked ot showing level is nice and makes the product usable. The silly part is the wall mount it comes with. It does not work and even if it did why would you poke a bunch of holes in your wall to use a level. It is an added feature that is useless and went to the trash as soon as we got it. The other features work well and we have gotten a lot of use out of this product. It is jsut way easier if you have a helper, if you are doing solo projects look somewhere else."
3,somewhat accurate only in automode,"There are two ""on"" positions, one is automode and the other is manual mode. In automode, the laser inside balances itself without respect to the outside case. In manual mode, the laser is locked to the scale that is backlit.Automode seems to work ok, not exactly perfect but ok for hanging things on the wall I guess. But the scale on the manual mode is certainly off by a large amount, and they don't give you a zeroing capability.The interface is setup such that the backlight for the degree wheel is completely off when in automode. Backlight comes on in manual mode, but they might have well saved the $ on the lamp because it will just irritate you by how poorly its zeroed.B&D; should consider adding the capability to zero out the manual mode, or remove the manual mode."
4,Black&Decker laser level,I liked the ease of using this product. I like the drywall nail and magnet on back of level. The different angles that you can use this at is a great feature. The only problem is the brightness of the red laser light. When used in brighter lit rooms it is hard to see down the length of the wall; it starts our strong and weakens as the line extends. This is good for me since I don't have many uses to use a level; except to hang pictures and curtain rods. This product makes it much easier for me to hang them straight. I can also do it alone; no need to ask someone if what I'm hanging is straight.
3,Having a problem with it,This was a gift and the family member was excited to use it. There seems to be a problem with it as the laser light is not strong enough. I will have to return it.
5,Review from the Publisher,"An explanation for everyone of St. Teresa of Avila's teaching about personal prayer, especially the prayer of meditation, which she calls the ""royal highway to Heaven."" Though a mystic, St. Teresa was an eminently practical person, and that quality imbues her approach to prayer - and this book. Filled with saintly wisdom. Easy to understand. Highly recommended by Fr. Dubay, author of ""Fire Within""."
2,Thought this might be fun...,"I have a fascination with early-mid sixties stuff, stumbled across this after seeing a clip on the web. The Swap is better than Sin In The Suburbs but neither was quite what I was looking for."
2,Stick with Amherst Books,"This book is marginal in content, has few new or exciting ideas, and is smaller than the books American photographers are used to seeing from Amherst and some of the other publishers.This was going to be the first book I ever returned to Amazon but before I could send it back I misplaced it somewhere...and its no loss."
5,An Educational Masterpiece,National Treasures is a wonderful reading experience. I highly recommend this book.The book provides an educational journey for young readers. It opens the doors of exploration of our nations most cherished achievements.
5,This book is something to treasure,This book is an excellent source of information for kids and for people like me who live outside the States. Kate Torpie paints a vivid picture of important and much loved American sites. She makes learning fun and should be highly comended for this book
4,Simple to use.,"I bought this hard drive to store music, movies, etc. I've had it almost two weeks, and here are my impressions so far:Pros: Easy to hook up, plug and play for XP, the stand that comes with it is very sturdy, the hard drive itself feels solid, simple design.Cons: Blue LED on the front is to bright, usable space on the drive only reads as 150 GB, the power brick that comes with the drive is fairly large.Overall, this is a good hard drive for the money. Besides a few design quirks it has, I'd recomend this drive to anyone looking for a inexpensive external HD."
2,Suddenly stopped working,"Bought this disk some months ago ... but suddenly it stopped working. I tried with Windows and MAC , USB and Firewire ... but no luck. Until that point in time I had no problem with the device"
5,Jellyfish Inside Out,"What a great book for kids! There's really nothing else out there for 9 to 12 year-olds on jellyfish. My niece just loved this! The text is fun, the photos are terrific and the CD-ROM gave her lots to do after she read the book. She also liked the section where she learned about becoming a scientist!"
3,The ink gunks the nibs,"I bought this at a hobby store because I love writing in different colors. I found out that this type of ink will only work well with fine point nibs. I've tried the inks with my other dipping nibs, I love using stub nosed nibs, and the ink gets all cakey/or gunked in the nibs. Oh well.So for fine nibs, the ink is good, but stub nosed nibs, not so well unless you like cleaning the nib very often when you write."
3,"Great Quanity, Poor Quality","I bought this because I was impressed with the range of colors offered in one set. However, the quality of inks were really sub-par. The Gold and Silver tend to congeal when using them, which disrupts the flow of your strokes. Additinally, the black ink was watery and useless for writing. Usually, I would highly recommend Speedball products, but you should probably be a little hesitant about buying this one."
4,A must for collectors of the era.,"It works as advertised. It's as good as any dri-lube product, although somewhat expensive. It's a must for serious gun users."
1,Better Left Alone,"I understand what the author was trying to do... Help those who are in the Wiccan tradition understand and convert some of their practices. But, this book does a very poor job in doing so. Anyone interested in combining the practices of Santeria, Wiccan or any of the African traditions. Would be best to study New Orleans Voodoo and it would help them to read Luisah Teish's Jambalaya. You would be better off to skip this book. Only qualified individuals should attempt to do what this author is suggesting. Then again, some things are better left alone.Unfortunately, this is one of the reason why it is hard to go deeper into these traditions because of people trying combine, mix, convert or whatever. Please skip, if you know what's good for you."
1,This book is terrible!,"If there was ever a book that managed to say nothing at all it is this one. It is very poorly written and most of it makes no sense whatsoever. The author makes absolutly NO connection between the Yoruba and Santeria traditons, except for a few very misguided sentences. It is full of inacurate information. This book is awful. I burned mine immediatly! I wish I would have read the reviews of this book before I wasted my money on it. It's garbage, trust me, don't throw your money away, buy another book!"
4,Nice Action Figure,"This is a nice posable action figure with lots of accessories. I did not know how large it would be when I bought it. It is around 6"" tall."
1,Written by a kid?,"What a joke this book is. You can find all of the designs on the internet for free! They are very basic, and there are only a few examples for the tribes they list. They don't even get specific with any of the tribes, they just use ""South American Tribes, European Tribes, African Tribes,"" etc... It's all just very basic info, so beginner that you can find it all online for free with no problem. DON'T BUY. Trust me."
3,What a strange and different sort of book!,"This was a gift, and the premise of a book-within-a-book was quite interesting. I must admit that it did take me a little while to become accustomed to its rather unorthodox style, but there were many genuinely entertaining parts to it. Unfortunately, there were also some rather dull sections. I think I would have enjoyed it more if I had more background knowledge of some of the Irish myths and legends the book played off of - and if I had a greater appreciation for poetry. Still, it was a unique sort of book and one I would have liked to read as part of a lit class or a book club, because I really feel that it could lead to a lot of rich discussions."
5,The Real Reader from Winston-Salem,"It has been brought to my attention that some blagard representing himself as the reader from Winston-Salem has been on here with a great deal to say for himself. In the words of the great man himself (MnagC) this sort of thing has gone too far. (Murmurs of approval from the torch bearing hoard of villagers a.k.a. the Plain People of Ireland.) I am the real reader (a singularity) from Winston-Salem and I intend to stay this way. I will have the Civic Guards look into this matter of virtual impersonation.By the way, this book deserves a full 5 stars (although the German professor described on the last page who made his life a thing of triads would have had some difficulty with such a quintet) and should not be reviewed by people who would put it about that they have read ""Finnegan's Wake""."
4,nonsense and beauty,"More than ""The Dalkey Archive"" & ""the Third Policeman"" ""At Swim"" seems more complete. One would think it was a latter novel, rather than O'brien's first. What makes it so good, besides the crazy nonsense of a writer writing about a writer, who's writing about a writer and his charcaters is the humor and the language, the wordplay and wit. It is also very modern. If I didn't know it was published in 1939, I'd say it was a new novel!"
3,very so-so,"I bought this book because I knew there were a few really cute patterns in it I wanted. There's a really lovely bed sweater, too cute bunny booties for babies and a shoulderette. A lot of the patterns are really ugly though...a cropped sweater? No thanks. Reading through the book though I'm noticing that the directions are horribly vague and difficult to follow. I'm sure I can slosh my way through but it definitely makes knitting these beautiful items a lot less fun."
2,Not Very Vintage,"I was really excited that Vogue came out with this. But when I read it, I found that the patterns were pretty dull - even ugly at times, and they really don't look very vintage (unless you consider 1980's vintage). When I think of vintage patterns, I think of little fifties sweaters, boleros, knitted suits, cute hats and items that really shout their era. These are just plain and generic. Can a sock pattern really be vintage?Get ""Vintage Knits"" instead - it isn't as portable, but is much more accurate!"
2,please show sweaters ON PEOPLE,"Some of these pattterns looked cute, but ultimately I am reluctant make any because there are no pictures of the items actually worn on a person. The portrait-collared 50s sweater, for example: how fitted is it? How cropped? We can't tell from a photo of the sweater flat on a surface. Please, knitting pattern publishers: we need to see the patterns actually modelled!"
2,Average,"The patterns in this book are really average. They are easy enough to follow, but they're outdated and nothing special. It's definitely worth the $.01 I spent on it."
1,Not very Vintage,The projects in this book were mostly for children and looked more like 1980s than actually vintage (50s-60s) as I expected.
5,Great story.,I recommend this to any Christian to really see what others went through so long ago. This is history that no longer gets taught.
1,Not Happy,"packaging was damaged very badly. the case had a hole in it and one of the slots that keeps the movie in its place was broken so the movie was moving around in the case, getting scratched in the process. the product was said to be in good condition. I would say that is anything but good."
5,Amazing Collection of Speeches,"Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. is one of America's greatest heroes and this is a collection of his wonderful writings and speeches. Often people stop at ""I Have a Dream"" but this shows the complete evolution of Dr. King. A wonderful read that has been part of my library for the past 10 years -- and I've read it three times and often use it for reference and store it next to the Bible."
5,Awesome!!,"This book is a must for all buffy fans, or even just fans of this episode...the book itself has interesting, facts and trivia about the episode as well as behind the scenes stuff i personally love it!!"
4,Great system,I have borrowed this from the library and wish is were available in CD form. The way they put the lessons together has made it very easy for me to learn in the car. It was very hard for me to find tapes that started at the advanced beginner level. So many of them were so basic they were totally boring.
4,"Sounds great, looks great.","This was taped the same year as the Three Tenors performed, also celebarting the same occassion. Luciano sounds fresh and healthy.Here he sings Puccini, Donizetti, and Neapolotan songs. Dare I say, I have some complaining to do. Could Pavarotti survive if he sung much more Verdi? (Di quella pira, Quest o quella, or La donna e mobile) And also, perhaps, some Rossini? (Ecco rident in cielo, or something from William Tell) The conductor, Leone Magiera, was not the greatest choice ever made. Why not Zubin Mehta or James Levine?Anyhow, here is La Grande Tenor at his best. Enjoy!"
3,Not at his best I think,"This concert is pretty good, but it's not as good as perhaps Pavarotti's performaces alongside Domingo and Carreras. Perhaps I expected too much and so I was disappointed more than I should have been.I felt very little emotion emanating from Pavorotti, I suppose after singing them for so many years its hard to give energy every single time, but still it wasn't really satisfying. However E Lucevan le stelle and the Vesti la giubba were the stand outs of this particular DVD. The other well known stuff like O sole mio, nessun dorma and torna surriento were enjoyable but not particularly moving.Overall his voice seemed a little tired(which is to be expected at that age, and after 5 encores), but the fact that he stands there with he arms out-stretched soaking in the attention after EVERY-SINGLE-ARIA does get on my nerves.It was good to watch anyway."
2,"I read this based on having read ""Mirage"" - I wish I hadn't!","I didn't think ""Mirage"" was a great book but it was entertaining. Therefore, I decided to read ""The Visionary"". It turned out to be a bad decision. The identity of the culprit was obvious within the first few chapters. The ending was so stilted that it bordered on being just plain silly."
3,The Visionary - the end is never in sight,"On the recommendation of other reviewers, I kept going past the slow start of this book. I, too, found it suspenseful and intriguing, with good character and plot development. I have read lots of books about serial killers, and although I think the author researched widely, I was disappointed in the ending for that very reason. I don't believe there were really any pointers to the killer throughout the book, and therefore the killer's identity was not only unexpected for that reason, but also for the reason that serial killers are rarely..... And I can't finish that without giving the whole thing away."
1,What a horrible book!,"What a horrible book! Let's just hope the author isn't planning to write another one. Apparently the author is an important entertainment lawyer who used his connections to get this published. It certainly was not chosen on its literary merit! Save your money, folks."
2,Nothing new here,This book was soooooooooo predictable. I guessed the identity of the killer 1/4 of the way thru. I only kept reading in the hope that I was wrong and that the author would spring something unexpected on me. No luck. All of the reviewers who gushed over this book must not read very many mysteries. Though will say that the officer in charge of the invstigation was an interesting character.
4,Not for kids only,"Though advertised as children's music this album is light-hearted, positive and upbeat. It has a great sound!"
1,"unaceptably ""colonial""","I think this is the first negative review I have ever written for a book. I used to eat at Legal Seafood when my company sent me to the East Coast. That will not happen again. I love eating shellfish and fish. But I am not a sadist. Most of the cookbooks I read in California give explicit directions for ""dispatching"" (killing) lobsters before cooking. It is humane and appropriate. However the legal Seafoods cookbook advocated putting live lobsters in microwaves and cautions that the lobster may move (thus causing ""discomfort"" to the cook).I was so disgusted that I did not even donate this book the the local ""friends of the library"" which resells them. Rather, I put it in the paper recycle bin where it will never be read again.Legal Seafood is significantly out of sync with modern sensibilities."
2,Piss Over Me,"Yes, Adam Sandler has emotional range as an actor. He can exude suffering with the best of them. But does that mean we have to suffer through the whole movie too? Don Cheadle's great and the supporting cast is excellent, but the plot just drags on at rock bottom pathos for nearly its entirety, and the side plots (spousal conflict and baseless allegations of professional sexual misconduct) don't really go well with the main plot, which is Adam Sandler's inability to cope with the loss of his family to the 9-11 terror attacks. The movie reminded me of Lorenzo's Oil, where the hopelessness and suffering just go on and on until it becomes mind-numbing."
3,Reign over me,The movie was not what I expected. A different role for Adam Sandler. Watching it once was good enough for me.
4,Not Bad,"My wife wanted to see this movie so I went not expecting much. I was really suprised at how much I liked the film. For those of you who hate Sandler's comedy, he is going for a full dramatic role in this film and he is quite good. Yes there are some humurous moments and Sandler does have a funny line or two, but this is truly a drama. The story is about friendship. Even though it appears it is about how Sandler can't handle the grief over the lose of his family on 9/11, it is also just as much about Cheadle coming to grips with his own life which is not where he wants it to be. It is about them helping each other. Not a perfect story, but a tale well told and well acted all the way around."
4,This Isn't A Review...,"...as much as a warning.I don't know if it's intentional or not, but the case for this film depicts a smiling, almost jovial Adam Sandler in each photo in which he appears. And the disc itself has a downright laughing Sandler and Don Cheadle depicted on it.Truth is, the film is nothing like that at all.Perhaps the intention is to trick you into thinking this is another Adam Sandler yukfest, you know, another of his inane romps through a light and fluffy comedy.Uh, I don't think so.Sandler is a very depressed and very morose character in this film and, to be honest, you'll probably sob more than you laugh as you watch this.I don't remember laughing once, because there's very little comedic relief as you endure Sandler's condition, along with Cheadle and the rest of the cast.It's a good film hiding a great film.But don't let the box fool you...there's very little to laugh about as you watch.VERY little."
4,Decent film for out of the box sandler. Great story,"This is a good stroy of love and loss and restoration. The storyline itself of a reclusive ex dentist named chester (played by sandler) re-connects with his ex dental school roomate (cheadle) by happenstance, and how both re-discover the the power of the mind and heart is pretty original, and powerful concept, and that is why this gets four stars. The humor is top notch also. However, sandler tries his best in some parts, but falls into occasional unconvincing points durign the film, along with the predictability of the therapy relationship. Overall, still good movie to rent and watch with a friend or two."
1,Skip it,"Hadnt heard a thing about this movie- no previews or anything, well my buddy brought a copy over, and hyped it up... This was a huge dissapointment. Very slow moving, i actually thought the movie was 3 hours long when i got up. I took a 20 min phone call in the middle of it and didnt miss a thing. What really made this movie bad was that during most of the very intense serious moments, they'd crack a joke that just seemed out of place. I'm a die hard Sandler fan, so maybe my expectations were set to high, but really, who wants to finish watching a $30 blu-ray and look at your buddy and say ""man i wished i hadn't bought that."""
4,A visual of true friendship,"""Reign Over Me"" is an incredible film. Poignant and dramatic, this story of a man who's lost everything on September 11, 2001 is a vigorous exercise in true friendship and family love. Adam Sandler delivers a brilliant performance as a socially dysfunctional widower whose wife and three daughters were on board one of the hijacked airplanes, effectively ending his life on that fateful day. Don Cheadle is Sandler's former college roommate who happens to see Sandler in the street, and seeks to touch base and catch up with an old friend. Cheadle's character's dedication to Sandler's is truly unique in a world where ""close friends"" wouldn't put up with such grief and unconventional behavior. Jada Pinkett Smith and Liv Tyler also deliver fine performances. Donald Sutherland had a small role, but really stole the scenes he was in. This film warmed my heart, made me laugh, and gave me a glimpse of what a true friend is."
4,Sandler and Cheadle both shine in this.,"I saw this at the theaters and it totally blew me away. First off, while the movie has it's funny moments between Sandler and Cheadle, it is NOT, I repeat, NOT a comedy. Don't expect Happy Gilmore/Billy Madison from Sandler in this as his character is a very troubled widower who deals with his loss in his own eccentric ways. Sandler gives a heartfelt performance as Charlie Fineman, a former Dentist who lost his wife and three children in 9/11. Don Cheadle plays his old college roomate who hasn't seen him in many years. They run into each other a few times and start to rekindle their friendship. Cheadle's character attempts to sympathize with Sandler's character, but opens up a volatile and dangerous side in him. Great movie, go see it and enjoy."
3,Movie wanders like Sandler's character,"Don Cheadle plays a wealthy dentist who runs into his old college roommate, played by Adam Sandler. Sandler has gone through the trauma of losing his family in a plane crash and he survives by going into denial, refusing to talk about it, and pretending that it didn't happen. Cheadle tries to be a good friend to him, despite Sandler's erratic behavior. This movie drifts for the first hour and a half and at times it's hard to say where it's going. It also has an identity crisis and the scriptwriter can't seem to decide if it's going to be a comedy or a drama. The saving grace of the movie is the acting of both Don Cheadle and Adam Sandler. Cheadle is consistantly good in his movies, but this is a first for Adam Sandler who shows that he can do serious drama as well as slapstick comedy. Hopefully he will do more serious movies and will have better material to work with in the future."
4,Wow...,What an intense movie. It brought tears to my eyes many times. Adam Sandler was amazing in this role. It was a powerful film on loss that happened to be tied to 9/11.
3,Rain Over My Parade,"This just wasn't my cup of tea. You can't blame Adam Sandler. Everyone is used to seeing him act crazy and funny all rolled into one. This is not one of them. He did an excellent job of my wanting to punch him in the face. I saw this movie on cable and, of course, they had the synopsis all wrong as usual. It's not the dentist who's depressed, it's Charlie (Adam Sandler). That's the way I saw it anyway."
3,Sandler Just Wasn't Convincing,"Scruffy hair, an unshaven face and mumbling dialogue don't make Sandler a believable dramatic actor in this movie. It was like he was trying too hard. The mumbling was annoying. He does better when he speaks clearly.The movie drags a bit. I think it could have been a powerful story but Sandler didn't help. Cheadle's performance was very good though.Movie was only OK."
2,Unfortunately Another Sandler Flop.,"Don Cheadle tried to pull this film back repeatedly from the gutter as Sandler was as persistantly adamant about leading it back into it. What good parts there were was carried by Cheadle and they came at intervals that made you think the movie was starting to turn good. Unfortunately it was a false hope. Sandler's over acting of his character's part was way too much. The movie subject matter is admirable and worth writing many 'good' storylines. It does have a good ending in spite of Sandlers inability to perform earlier throughout the flick. I have to admit the best part I liked about the video was the jam session with Sandler in the ""Special Features"" section of the DVD. Overall, I have to say I didn't really care for the movie but then again maybe I was looking for a little more of Sandlers funny side to help it along.Reign Over Me (Widescreen Edition)"
2,Disappointing...,"The hubby and I were really looking forward to this one and I hate to be the first party pooper on the ratings but... It only gets 2 stars because Don Cheadle was so good in it. Adam Sandler was good too but it was just soooo slow. Not like I thought this was going to be some feel good movie but you wanted to hang yourself it was so depressing and with no real resolution. It was so long that when I realized there was 30 minutes left, I got online and read the ending to see if it was worth watching. It wasn't."
3,First rate and worth the price of admission!,"Adam Sandler really shines in this touching movie about loss and recovery. I have always been a big fan of his comedy...but, his true talents are given a chance to shine in this fantastic film.Everyone in the theater was not only reaching for kleenix in several parts...but praising the film after it ended.First rate and worth the price of admission."
3,Sandler is not likeable,"That's my main problem with this movie. Sandler's character is too unlikeable for the viewer to even care what happens to him. He's such a loser by the way he reacts to his tragedy and how he treats everyone so badly, that you don't care if he gets better."
5,Great Story Of Starting Over Only On Blu-Ray!,"If you enjoy movies about starting over and tough times, get this movie on Blu-ray dvd (NOT HD-DVD)!"
4,reason?,"I am not a Sandler fan but I did enjoy this film. Other reviews can give you a synopsis of the content. But my question is - the title? Reign over me? What does it mean, is it from a song? This puzzles me."
3,"It serves its purpose, but its kinda annoying....","Its pretty awesome for if you want something cheap to go and time runs or whatever. But when I bought it, I didn't realize that there is no off function. There are alarms and hourly beeps that you can turn off but it is never clear whether or not they actually are.I was able to slip the tab that separated the battery from the circuitry in the packaging back into place, which is the only way to turn it off (besides removing the battery). So now that the annoying beeps are out of the picture, I think I will be pretty happy with it (at least until I lose the tab)"
1,Junk,I don't know how a company can sell such utter crap. Hit a button and it clicks twice (starts and stops).... now I have to bang it against something hard to get the LED to display. This company does not deserve a penny of ours!
2,Sportline 240 Stopwatch,"The stopwatches lost their battery life within 1-2 weeks. They constantly went off for no reason and it was not very easy to use. The ones that didnt die, served their purpose."
2,Time moves slower,"I was looking for a good stopwatch to help me with my training and figured I would give this inexpensive product a go. It was fairly simple to set and it worked well until I noticed that the clock was falling behind. I reset it and slowly it fell behind again. I went and bought a new battery and it still fell behind. I am looking at it right now after reseting it for the last time a couple of weeks ago and it is almost 15 minutes behind. With the clock being so off, it makes me wonder how accurate the other modes are. I either recieved a shody stopwatch or some reconfiguring needs to be done by the manufacturer.Update 09/02/2006:Was cleaning out my desk and came upon my stopwatch(don't ask me why I still have it). I was delt another hard blow when I looked at the clock again. It hasn't fallen behind this time. No, instead it is twenty minutes fast. I am incredibly disturbed by this. I believe I will go lie down and try to forget about this Oh So traumatic experience."
2,Alarm that won't turn off.,"In the instruction manual for this stopwatch, it says, ""Chime is ON when dashes appear above display. Chime is OFF when no dashes appear.""Unfortunately, the instructions are lying. The alarm on this watch will go off, regardless of dash situation. There is absolutely no way to turn off the alarm. If you are there to turn the alarm off at the same time every day, then this watch is a decent purchase. Everything else on it works well."
2,piece of crap,"The stopwatch works. Seems accurate anyway. But I can't set the time of day on this thing. I've done exactly what the instructions are telling me. I can switch between hours and minutes but I can't select anything to make the watch begin. I really think there is something wrong with the watch. I guess it doesn't matter, but the watch should work."
2,First one defective. 2nd one worked fine.,"The first one I received had a defective (left) reset button. No way to reset the count-up time. I returned it and got a replacement, which functioned perfectly. I love amazon. They even refunded the postage required to send back the defective unit."
4,Alpha Centauri enhanced with new factions and more,"Seven years after planetfall, as the Gaians, Collective, University and other factions struggle to make their way on Planet, two alien spacecraft fight in the space above...and ultimately crash land, to make their own way on Planet.Alien Crossfire puts the Alpha Centauri game in the center of this conflict, as the factions we all know and love are caught between the Caretakers and Preservers, two alien factions diametrically opposed to each other and any who would ally with the other. New Human factions to play such as the Cyborgs and Pirates just add to the fun. New unit types, and planetary features such as the Manifold Nexus make the Alpha Centauri experience even richer than the already excellent basic game."
4,A good choice.,"My buddy got me hooked on this game. Naturally the original and not the Expansion. But I like the expansion. I like the fact that you can randomize the races. The aliens lifeforms have a little more spunk to them, such as a ranged attack. The basic game is there, with a little more bonus. The original characters intermix with the new characters. It's all that and a bag of chips."
2,Stash fails splendidly this time.,"The flavors you immediately notice after the first sip of this tea, are hisbiscus flowers and chamoile. The Pomegranate and Raspberry flavors and the green tea are all buried and very faint! If you are looking for a tea to wind down your hectic life, this is not a bad tea at all. If you are looking for an excellent blend of Pomegranate and Raspberry flavors in green tea, you maybe be very disappointed like I do."
3,"Still a cinnamon tea, but not as overpowering as in Stash's Organic Chai Black & Green Tea","This is a very pleasant green tea. The cinnamon is fairly dominant but counterbalanced quite well by the green tea flavor, even though Stash did use cinnamon oil.I was a little scared about the cinnamon after my unpleasant experience with Stash's Organic Chai Black & Green Tea, which was ruined by too much cinnamon oil.After I use up these six boxes I do not know if I will purchase anymore Stash tea.Stash needs to hold off on using the spice oils (especially the cinnamon), even though it isn't so offensive in this particular tea, they could still tone it down a bit more."
3,the flavor was not what I expected,"Had this been labeled ""green tea with a touch of pomegranate and raspberry essence"" I might have rated this higher. However, the name is pomegranate raspberry and I therefore expected those vary flavors. The overall taste is mild and muddled. I except a greater sweetness. The tea's second ingredient, chamomile, has a distinctive presence. While I didn't find the flavor to be unpleasant, there is nothing about it that would make me reach for it over one of my other teas."
3,"pretty good tea,","I drink this tea in the evenings, and enjoy it. I do think it's a bit stale, and the flavor could be stronger."
3,"The fragrance is lovely, but it is too fermented to be good green tea.","The fragrance is strong and floral - lovely. The tea is dark golden brown and much more like a fermented Oolong than green tea. I didn't like it at first, because it lacks the gentle subtlety of the blend of green and jasmine. It's almost like an afternoon tea with jasmine added. Over time, this tea has grown on me, and I like that it is a bit stronger than a typical jasmine green. However, when I want that delicate flavored, I look for something else, even the Bigelow (and I'm not a great Bigelow fan)."
5,Great tea to drink!,I drink green tea because its healthy for you especially green tea. Ide say this tea with sugar tastes very very good its one of my drop the soda substitute since its so great! I recommend this tea to buy over some of the more nastier tea's out there but Great Product overall!
5,Stash Is A Smash!,"I had been drinking Bigelow's green tea and other brands for several years now and ultimately grew tired of, although I grew up drinking Jasmine (loose leaf) tea most of my life. I feel as if I have come full circle by experiencing Stash Premium Jasmine tea for the first time. As with all green tea drinkers it has a distinctive taste whether it be a known domestic brand or the more exotic Asian brands. I tried this Jasmine tea in both strengths, weak and strong (by varying steeping times). Either way, the beautiful classic fragrant of Jasmine clearly comes through and if you will all but masks the original flavor of the green tea experience. At any rate, the flavor is absolutely delicious and a wonderful marriage of the health benefits of green teas and aromatic sensory delights of Jasmine blossoms I've known and always enjoyed! Buying bulk is the only way to go."
3,Chamomile vs caffeine,"I bought a pack of the Pomegranate Raspberry Green Tea. Taste is good, however I don't know why Stash felt the need to add chamomile. Chamomile is used as a sleep aid. Why would they mix it with green tea that has caffeine? I had bought this for use at work to get over the afternoon slump. Apparently the chamomile is stronger than the caffeine because instead of waking me up, it knocks me out... snoring."
5,Love This Tea,"This tea is awesome! It's a little lighter than standard green tea, but still has all the great health benefits. Stash is a quality tea but I have trouble finding this blend of green and white tea at the store, so having it shipped to me every few months is a great way to save time and money."
2,Hot water,"I tried to like this tea being that I bought a whole box, but I am still working on it going 4 months now. I drink at least one cup of tea at work everyday and I am partial to mint in my tea. However, there is little to no tea or mint flavor going on here. I have shared this with many people at work and it isn't just me.There are particles left behind in the tea bag with more aroma than the brewed tea itself. I always leave the bag in the cup as I drink it and it never gets stronger. There is nothing satisfying about it, I might as well just drink hot water.I do like stash teas but don't make my mistake, try it first. The packages I received are different than pictured now, maybe it has improved. I am disappointed."
5,This is a favorite tea,"I like this tea a lot. I use it for iced tea as well, it adds a light mint tone to it. I add a couple bags to the mix in the iced tea maker, it comes out great."
2,I'll pass,"For some reason, I was just not able to fully enjoy this tea.I tried to brew it different ways starting with the water temperature and brewing length.At best this tea was just okay when lightly brewed and some might enjoy the subtle flavor this way.I thought most jasmine blossoms take time to develop but the longer I brewed this tea, the more bitter it became and tasted so strange I had to dump it on more than one occasion.Due the ratings for this tea being very high on amazon.com, I wanted to like this tea and tried my best to enjoy it.Maybe I got a bad batch, but for now I'll pass on this tea.* * 2 / 5 * * * * *Ciao"
3,Rooibos and nothing more,"Red&White tastes exactly like plain rooibos, which was slightly disappointing since I was expecting something more exotic, thanks to the tea's name. Nonetheless, it's a decent rooibos tea with strong flavor."
5,Pure and Not Bitter,Green tea can be very bitter especially if you brew it too long. This tea brews quickly and has a very pure taste and delicate aroma. I like drinking each cup with a packet of stevia. It seems to sweeten it just enough without masking the subtle silky flavors. This tea is made of rare white tea and green tea. White tea actually has more antioxidants than green tea and has less caffeine. So this particluar tea is very healthy. However you will probably drink it often because it tastes so good.~The Rebecca Review
2,Stash fusion green & white tea,"It just doesn't taste good to me, its really bitter. I recommend Bigelow green tea over htis, it tastes much better and is not bitter."
3,Not strong Jasmine flavor,I have not found any jasmine tea bags that compare to the flavor of Jasmine Dragon Pearl. This one was just OK
5,Great Stuff,"I use a lot of stash tea products and this is my favorite to use. I use a Mr. Coffee Iced Tea maker and I can't keep the 3qt. pitcher full. My family and daughter are all over the stuff, which is good as its a great alternative to soda or fruit juices. Also I have bought this other places and seems like this is a better deal than many other places."
2,Not as good as I had hoped,"I've been hooked on NOW's spearmint tea for awhile, and when that was unavailable for a time, I found this. I'd been wanting the benefits of green tea again anyway, and this seemed the ideal mix of the two, with the added bonus of peppermint and lemongrass. The glowing reviews here sealed my decision...but alas, I sadly haven't found this to be as wonderful as they did. I find this tea to be pretty bland no matter how little or long I steep it, and there's barely a trace of either mint to be detected. Now anything like this is going to be a matter of personal taste, obviously. I do recommend trying a single box if you can before committing to the case of 6."
5,Wonderful mix of green tea and chai flavor,"I like drinking green tea for the health benefits, but I find that many are either boring-tasting or bitter, especially without the addition of added sugar. Luckily, I discovered Stash Chai Green Tea, which tastes great completely on its own! It is a wonderfully fragrant tea with a tasty combination of spices, including cinnamon, ginger, allspice, nutmeg, clove, and cardamom. The combined effect is aromatic and slightly spicy (not as spicy as regular chai tea). You can add milk and sugar to make this tea creamier and more similar to traditional chai, but I prefer to drink it plain, as I think it's perfect as is. Finally, the small amount of caffeine in the green tea makes Stash Chai Green Tea a great pick-me-up at any time of the day--highly recommended!"
1,Unpleasant Grassy Taste,"I realize that taste in tea, and particularly green tea is a matter of personal preference. For me, I found this tea to be unpleasant. Opening the tea bag, I detected an aroma reminiscent of lawn clippings. As I drank the tea, I find the unpleasant aroma becomes an unpleasant taste. I am not sure how to describe it . . . perhaps wet lawn clippings or even a mossy taste. I do not get the sharp ""bite"" I normally expect from a good green tea.I will try this for a week, and see if I am missing something, but as for now, I can not recommend purchasing this tea."
5,Wonderful Teas,I bought this tea wanting to try something new and was NOT dissapointed.I drink it every morning.
2,Not great,"Very disappointed with the flavor, or lack therof. Stash usually has dependable products, so this was a real letdown."
1,Not if you like Salada Green Chai Tea,"I'd never tried this before, but because I like Salada's version so much, and the reviews were so good, I figured I'd try it. Well, it's just not MY cup of tea - really intesely sweet spices - back to Salada for me!"
1,Does anyone else on Amazon know what green tea is supposed to taste like?,"Im not sure what everyone else on here thinks green tea is supposed to taste like, but this is not it. I go through about half a gallon of green tea a day, so Im always willing to try new flavors, brands, etc. This is the only one that I have had to literally choke down. This tea is bitter, but thats not the real reason its so bad. The taste is cheap, overpowering, and unpleasant.I think either Stash has its employees writing reviews, or amazonians are being suckered in by the snazzy/hip box and packets of this truly awful tea."
5,FINALLY--a green tea that is drinkable,"This is the only way to get the benefits from Green Tea. The blend of spices is so good. I like it iced with Truvia. Easy to drink and refreshing. A great tea to take on the go. Can't say enough. I found it at my local Albertson's Grocery, but am anxious to use the convenience with Amazon."
5,Yummy!,"I really enjoyed this tea and will definitely order again. The jasmine is subtle and more of a scent than a flavor to me, but it's still wonderful."
4,Yum!,The Moroccan Mint Green Tea by Stash is simply delightful. I generally enjoy 1-3 cups a day (considering I have six boxes to consume) and each one is delicious. The mint and lemongrass keep the tea from being too astringent.
2,Tastes like Cough Syrup,"I really wanted to like this tea because it is full of antioxidants. I was hoping for a fruity flavor, but instead it tastes just like cough syrup. I do not have good memories of cough syrup as a child, so because the flavor reminds me so much of yucky cough medicine, I can not drink it. I tried to drink it anyways, thinking that the benefits of a tea filled with anti-oxidants outweigh the flavor, but I just couldn't do it! Well, that is just my 2 cents. If anyone else has tried this and agrees with me, let me know!"
1,Not that great,"I love the Stash brand tea. I love the flavors of Pomegranate, Raspberry but put them together with green tea isn't a taste I like. I figured given the fact that I love the taste of Pomegranate and Raspberries I would like this one but personally I don't like it. But just because I don't like it doesn't mean someone else wouldn't like it. It is something you should judge for yourself."
2,"Astringent, weak tea","I didn't really care for this tea that much. I've been trying out teas to find which ones I like, I've tried about 30 so far. I like Celestial seasoning's Mandarin Orchard green tea and Salada green tea better than this. I find most Stash brands to be astringent tasting, leaving my mouth feeling dry. If I really watch how hot the water is and steep for only a short time, then the taste is bearable but very weak. My husband also doesn't like any of the stash teas that we've tried."
3,Green tea,"I'm new to green tea so I purchased this product with Bigelow Green Tea, Preferred tea is Bigelow without any doubt but that's my personal preference."
3,Comment on new box design...,"I love this tea, but I find the new box design annoying. I don't really like the photos on the boxes and I have gotten two different types, this one and the Hazelnut one and both of them had flaps that ripped and they don't stand upright like the other style did, the old style with no picture. I don't know why this is, but it bothers me enough to tell others about it."
5,Love it,"Stash Moroccan mint is my favorite, but this makes a nice change. IT's got the same mellow mint as the Moroccan mint, but it's also got lime flavor. It's not like drinking a mojito- but with a fresh slice of lime and some sugar, it's pretty darned good. I drink it how, but the other reviewer suggested it over ice. That would be great, I'm sure- I just happen to like my tea hot."
5,Stash premium green tea,One of the best invidually bagged green teas. I am picky but I enjoy this tea.
3,Not bad.,"I actually like this tea, but I did give it three stars for a couple of reasons. The tea, in my opinion, is average... nothing really to set it apart... three stars is average... The tea is not organic, no really high points, no really bad points... again... average. The biggest negative for me is the price... at the supermarket they usually have sales on tea that would make this a lot cheaper if bought there."
5,Angelique continues to Bewitch and fascinate us!,"I've loved Dark Shadows since I was ten and, along every other kid I knew I watched it every day!This book is interesting because it tells the story of Angelique's childhood on Martinique and what happened in her life before she came to Collinsport.I am an actual real-life Witch and the things that Angelique does aren't even close to what we do. We are bound by the Wiccan Rede to ""Harm None,"" and I don't think she ever cast a circle when she did a spell! We also don't worship, or even believe in, Satan.This is a great book, but highly innacurate about Witchcraft. She will always be, in my opinion, the most interesting of all the Dark Shadows characters and I never liked Josette much anyway! What a spoiled brat! How Barnabas could ever have chosen Jossdette over Angelique...go figure!"
5,Wonderful,"As a long time D.S. fan, the book took me back to the episodes where Vicki Winters went back in time. Miss Parker did a wonderful job. I'd like to commend her on a job well done. I had always wondered how Barnabas & Angelique had met and why she hated him so. The book answered alot of my questions. It was worth buying. A++++++++"
5,Excellant biography of a fictional character,"Lara Parker does a excellant job taking a character already established and making a past for her that is so realistic that it is almost a anti-climax when she gets to the part that was already handled on the television show. You become very involved in the life of the young Angelique and it is very interesting that she invlolved Barnabas into the young life. Her descent into the evil that becomes such a part of her later life is fascinating and you better understand her betrayal of her best friend. I also liked that she involved Barnabas and Julia together finding the diary and becoming so involved in reading it like a addiction that you can't fight even though you know you should. I was very happy with the book and could find no major flaws,"
4,"A good start of a new series, like a visit from old friends","A tad over written in places, this is a nice first effort by Ms. Parker in recapturing what was, in my youth, my favorite TV show. Admittedly from Angelique's standpoint makes this sometimes a bit much to take (in the show Angelique was pure evil and showed little remorse at any time, the book tries to 'explain' this away) but does lend insight into the character's background. I look forward to more books dealing with the Collins of the present and how Barnabas gets out of marrying Julia. And what of David, Roger and Carolyn and Elizabeth? As I said, I look forward to more visits from old friends."
3,Lara Parker does a great job filling in the gaps but.......,Being a big DS fan I was glad to receive this book as a gift. Although the book was very interesting I found it to be inconsistent with former story lines revealed in the actual series.
5,Excellent Book!,"I was a huge fan of Dark Shadows when it aired originally and have been very pleased to see so much internet information on the show. This was a very good read, and I read it cover to cover at one sitting. Any fan of vampires, witches, love, intrigue and Dark Shadows will enjoy it immensely. Good work, Lara Parker. I hope another Dark Shadows book is in the works!"
2,Angeliques's Descent,This book was well written but too dark for me. I could only get through the first few chapters before I decided not to read this book.
1,For Dark Shadows Completists Only,"Somewhere within this dull 500-page novel there is a good 250-page novel. Ms. Parker, who played Angelique on the '60s TV show ""Dark Shadows"", certainly has a wealth of interesting ideas about the origins of the character. Unfortunately, these ideas get lost amidst the overly-descriptive prose."
2,A nice reminder of why DS is so fun,"It was nice to finally read something new about two of the most important characters in DS. Parker does a nice job of setting atmosphere and filling in some of the internal components of Angelique. However, the book took too much time during Angelique's early years without using this background information to inform her motivation in later years. What was it about these experiences that made her drawn to Barnabas or made her so vengeful in the actual story line of the soap? Likewise, Parker should have spent more time on the latter years (pre the story line seen on TV - when A & B first become intertwined) in a more substantial way. Nonetheless, it was a fun read and I look forward to having a go at the latest DS novel. It's great to see some new material about some wonderfully fun characters."
2,Don't bother,"If you are a fan of dark shadows, then you already know the story, the first part of the book is about a young Angelique which was a dull read the second half is a retelling of dark shadows earlier episode's which l have seen many times, I will read another book from Lara Parker, but this book was disappointing"
4,Good Read,Fans of Dark Shadows should love this book. A very revealing portrait of Angelique's beginning. Adds several layers to the character
5,If you are a fan.....,"I am 1/2 way thru this book and absolutely love it. Angelique was always one of my favorite Dark Shadow characters growing up. THis is one of those books that once you start readuing you can not put down. If you are a fan of Dard Shadows, you will certainly enjoy this book."
3,"Really, I wasted my time on this book!","The Dark Shadows video that recenty came out is so much better done than the series of books, however having read the books I understood some events in the movie that I would have not understood had I not read this book. I had planned to read the whole series but decided to quit after two."

2,Creaky Courtroom Drama Much Inferior to Recent Version,"From reviews I had read, I expected this story of a family's fight to clear the name of their cadet son to be excellent and possibly better than the recent version starring Jeremy Northam and Rebecca Pigeon. It was not. The actors were adequate (I am not a great fan of Robert Donat) but only. The film was dark, the sound poor, the characters did not really come alive to me and I saw very little believable chemistry between Donat's character, Sir Robert Morton, and that of the Winslow daughter, played by Margaret Leighton. The courtroom part was the best but the whole movie suffered from severe creakiness. My advice: go straight to the newer version, which was beautifully acted, completely engrossing, and blessed with wit and subtle humor as well as dramatic intensity."
4,Involving story of a father willing to do whatever it takes to prove his schoolboy son innocent of a minor theft.,"Based on an English play, this film does a good job of showing the consequences to an average middle-class family stemming from the father refusing to allow his young son to be dismissed from the Royal Navy College for a small theft he says he did not commit. The father's choices reverberate though the whole family. and the nation itself. Good enough to watch, with a lovely cup of tea."
4,Needs a US release,"One of my favorite films, ""The Winslow Boy"" is a showcase for Robert Donat, with his melancholy face and beautiful voice, and for the underused Margaret Leighton, who plays one of the rare women on film whose character is defined almost entirely by integrity. One of the pleasures of the film is watching as these two perform the elaborate social pavanne of Edwardian London, moving by the most indirect steps imaginable towards a relationship.Cedric Hardwicke is also especially good.The real question is: why on earth hasn't this movie been released on DVD in the US?"
3,There are many option,"Not Bad.. but you have many options.Before you go off start coding a solution, I suggest you look into what might already be available.Checkout out WapScrape at:http://wap.webdos.comThanks.Details from their site:NOW YOU CAN READ ANY WEBSITE FROM YOUR CELL PHONEIntroducing WapScrape Services - Opening the full internet to your cell phone browserThe internet is rich with dynamic information, but unfortunetly the vast majority of web sites are not available for WAP (Wireless Access Protocol) Browsers and cell phones..To bridge the WAP gap we've developed an HTML to WAP portal that allows you to pull the exact web site data you are looking for via your cell phone.Simply store our WapScrape site with the pre-set search range variables you define on your phone's favorites sites list and gain instant mobile access to previously unavailable WAP data.html2waphtml2wmlhtml to wap portalhtml sites on your cell phone browserhtml sites on waphtml sites in wmlhttp://wap.webdos.com"
1,1 star for LYING!,"The title of this book is a blatant lie.NOWHERE in this book does it cover WAP 2.0.In appendix A, it clearly states the book is only about 1.1!It covers the 1.1 version, which is now out of date.Chris Tull is not to blame - he covered 1.1 wonderfully;it's the publishers who were afraid of losing $$ that need to be very ashamed. Black eye for Que on this one!Don't be fooled by the 4 star rating; 4 of 6 are duplicates!"
2,WML is not WAP 2.0,"It is so sad this book ships so late. It is no use for any developer to learn WML anymore, because WAP 2.0 and the future will be XHTML Mobile Profile, not WML."
4,Good ASP & WAP Section,"I found the last section of this book especially helpful, which deals with using ASP in wireless applications. Good overview on database applications in wireless as well."
4,Good Examples,Great examples -- starts with WAP but leaves door open to couple what one's learned with other technologies. Great lesson for those learning wireless.
5,Golf is awesome!,What a fantastic book. Everyone should have one. Written by my old college roommate at Michigan! GO BLUE
5,Worth every penny!,"This paper makes me look like a professional used with my Canon Pro9000. Yes, it's expensive; but I don't print high volume. I highly recommend this product."
4,Cordless Headset,This is a good product. My boys are wrestlers and they use them faithfully to warm up. The cordless feature makes it easy to use and put away very quickly. I purchased 2 of these. I did have one of them break at the earphone. So be careful with them.
1,Needs better description,"I couldn't tell from the description what generation Nano would fit. The picture looked like Gen3, which I have, but when it arrived it was the original, smaller size. I returned the headset."
4,WARNING - First Generation Nano Only,"This seems to be a fine product, but Apple changed the location of the audio output on the 2nd generation Nano, and Macally has a new version for 2nd gen Nanos. Be sure you get the right one! (When I wrote this review, Amazon was not yet selling 2nd gen product.)"
3,iPod Nano headphones,"The Maclly Cordless Headset produces excellent sound but the slot in which you must slide the iPod is too small. It requires a lot of force to insert the iPod. Removing the iPod is not difficult. Nevertheless, I would suggest prospective buyers research other products before deciding whether to purchase this one."
1,Doesn't fit my ipod nano,"I think in theory this was a great product. Unfortunately, the prong which connects the headset to the iPod wasn't exactly in the right spot to connect. I had to modify it using the extra cord and clip the ipod in it's case to the earpiece and then hide the wire inside where the ipod was supposed to go.I bought this for my handicapped daughter (who has a problem with all the regular speaker cords that come with the ipods and tends to break them on a regular basis) and thought this would be a perfect solution.Too bad the speaker prong didn't line up with her iPod!"
3,Interesting but Uneven,"There are some wonderful stories collected here, many of which are classics (""The Snows of Kilamanjaro,"" ""The Things They Carried""). But what's disappointing is that the editor obviously selected many stories simply because of the stature of the author and not the story's merit. The most obvious example is the Fitzgerald story written just before his death, which is slight and cliched. And the choice of THREE stories by David Foster Wallace is just baffling."
5,"Excellent Description of Life in a Bengali, Islamic Village","I thoroughly agree with the one customer 5 star review so far and also with the 'official' editorial review; and I have little to add. This is an important book for understanding how Bangladeshi women live within a village practicing Islam. It's really quite sad that this wonderful book isn't more broadly available, as its lessons are quite current and can be applied beyond Bangladesh."
4,fine,unit works fine. use on drivway in fall to BBQ.does not have igniter. need long fireplace lighter to lite.
3,.,"Nice heater at a good price. Only downside is that when set on LOW in minimal wind conditions, the heater sometimes blows out but only when set on LOW. On high, there is no problem."
3,Good for the money but some modifications needed!,"Great little heater for the price, however the manufacturer needs to correct something. When you use it in light windy conditions (think of a normal day with a light breeze), the wind can cause the ""flame"" in the honey comb part to suck back into the heating cone. As a result, I had to think on my feet (not so easy when you're tailgating) and bend/cut an aluminum chafing dish to wrap around the back of the heater and help insulate from the wind.The manufacturer should make a plate of sorts that wraps around the back much in the same function. This also would help radiate some residual heat from the rear as well."
4,good tailgating heater,"great tailgating heater, unfortunately like the pop up tent i got too, it wasn't able to do a very good job in 50mph winds. will need to set it up in the enclosure of our tailgating canopy and walls to block out the wind next football season to block out the wind."
2,Mine didn't work so well,"The heater bracket is pretty flimsy and made of thin steel, but for the price I could've lived with and fixed that. The next thing I noticed was the heat level knob was almost upside down. To see what levels I was setting, I had to either bend over and turn my head all the way to the side or sit on the ground. Still, for the price, probably would've kept it.After lighting the burners on high and letting it run for a while I bent over to change the setting to medium and the burners went out. I tried it several times before deciding to return the heater. It's too bad to because they really pumped out some good heat on high. Maybe I just got a lemon but probably going to fork up a little more cash and get a better one."
1,Don't Buy,"This heater failed within two hours of initially starting it. The mode of failure was actually very scary. After running fine for about 90 minutes the propane flames in the reflector area went out and instead moved into the area behind the reflector (scary close to the rubber gas lines). The housings behind the reflector (normally not hot at all) turned red hot and emitted a loud ""jet engine"" sound. I shut the gas valve at the tank, waited for the heater to cool and promptly threw the whole thing in the trash! What a waste of money!"
2,Defective; Poor Service,"Out of the box one of Texsport burners didn't stay lit, even after holding the button for well beyond a minute, and making repeated tries over a few weeks. I called the company but they indicated I needed to talk with the vendor from whom I purchased it (ie, Amazon). Amazon, in turn, indicated I needed to talk with Texsport. So I am stuck with a defective product, which is too bad. It seemed a good deal for the price and the burner that does work puts out a good amount of heat. (Another possible shortcoming: the dishes/burners can't be re-aimed, but are both fixed aiming straight forward. The option to slightly angle one or both of the dishes out to the side might spread the heat out, allowing the Texsport to work better providing heat for a small group.)"
3,Propane Heater,Functional but not nearly as elegant as the towers with the tank in the base. As a result we seldom use it.
4,Warmed us up on the Soccer Field,"Happy with this heater. We used it a night game in Las Vegas and it worked very well. Easy to use. It is a bit flimzy, the front grill cam off on one of the heater (easy fix) but for the price I would recommend it."
1,It was a return so I got a good price.,I've had propane heaters before but this one was a return so I got a good price on it. To bad the company didn't test it out then they would have known it wouldn't light. I returned this but the good news is that Amazon paid the return item with no fuse at all. I printed the return label on my printer and that was it.
4,Nice heater for the money,"I first wanted to try the unit out before I rated. First of all the unit arrived very quickly. I easily assembled the heateronto my propane tank and was impressed by the heavy duty ""T"" brace holding the burners. The double burnerscannot be rotated outward to cover a wider area which I have seen with other manufacturers. My only real critiqueand disappointment was that the burners have no igniter and you must purchase a long stemmed lighter toignite them. This is not as handy as some of the other units I have used but all in all the heater does putout an extreme amount of heat in the ""HIGH"" position. For the price I would recommend this unit as a goodproduct for heating your work area or to knock the chill off on the patio."
5,Love it.,We temporarally enclosed our back patio for the winter. We love sitting out there especially now with this heater....it allows us to enjoy our patio longer.
4,Decent trailer jack,"Found this jack online after searching big box stores and other online sites. Price was reasonable and product was just as described. Don't expect much in instructions, what came in the box gave no mounting tips. If you are mechanically inclined it should be a breeze to figure out. If not, then you'll probably need help from somewhere. Overall great product and helps tremendously when pushing a trailer around if you are unhitching often."
3,trailor jack,"Good item that did my job, was not as heavy duty as I was looking for, but that is part of the problem in ordering off the enternet, you can not feel or touch the item, yes Irealize that AMAZON has the best return policy in the business, but I needed this jack to finish a project, it got the job done with out the extra you would like to see, you know what I nean,like a bakers dozen 13 instead of 12, just a little bit more for your money, this jack is what it was advertised to be, but only that, had I been in a store where I could have picked it up and gone over it, I might not have purchased it, But Yes It Did Get My Job Done!!!JLF"
1,Review of 1000 lb trailer Jack,Very dissapointed with this product. The tolerances associated with the swivel and lock mechanisms were terrible creating a wobbly jack that borders on dangerous. In addition when cranking the handle to raise or lower the height requires securing the wheel otherwise the wheel just spins without changing the height.
3,good bike,Bought this bike on sale for 240 + tax.First of all it is a good quality bike.I ride each other day to work (6 mile or 25 minutes cycling one way...) for 2 months.With my height 6ft this bike is a little bit small for me... maybe for person below 6ft it would be just fine.It provides nice comfortable ride. It is not super fast. It could be lighter.Overall it is OK... My next bike would be a road bike :)
2,Poor components,"I purchased this bike on August 30, 2011. It didn't last a year.I assembled it and took it to a bike shop to get a tune up. I was informed that both wheels were not true and the components were not of the best quality.I always had trouble with shifting(even after taking it to two different bike shops for tune ups)either it would skip a gear or the chain would pop out.I mainly used it as a road bike, but the few times I took it off road on a trail the chain always popped and as I would peddle I could feel it slipping.On one occasion the chain popped off and got tangled in the peddle. As I was down peddling and going up hill I couldn't stop resulting in the front derailleur getting yanked by the chain and completely warped(I was going pretty hard while going up the hill on a dirt trail)I decided to give up on this bike as my main road/mountain bike. I will fix it and keep it as a road bike, but it will definitively not be seeing any trails."
4,good looking bike,this bike its ok but you can get a better bike 4 a litle more money but if you want to look cool in a bike this its for you
3,Faded names in a faded video,Nice old movie with some good singing from Billy Gilbert and Bonnie Baker. Picture and sound leave a lot to be desired. Rare to see the very funny Gilbert in a leading role as he's best remembered for supporting Laurel and Hardy.
2,Not as good as it should be,"I bought a Rado a few years ago, but the band stopped closing and the jeweler sent it to the factory for a tiny metal piece that serves as a latching post. They wanted $350 to fix it as part of a total overhaul and they refused to only fix the clasp alone -- even though that is all that was in need of repair. Until then it seemed OK but with that kind of factory service I would rather throw it away than be ripped off. I had the entire movement of a Corum coin watch changed from windup to quartz for $275 a few years ago. Rado may not scratch but it will still be a bad investment -- buy a real quality watch brand instead."
2,No nutritional information,"I like this book and it has some great recipes! Pictures are worth a thousand words. I like cook books with lots of pictures. I didnt notice till I got home with the bok that there is no nutritional dietary information. I rely a lot of those numbers to help keep track of my health. Unfortunately I havent found any good websites to help calculate nutritional information when cookbook writers dont provide it. I would have loved to give this books more stars, but because it didnt have the nutritional information listed I was disappointed. If that is not something important to you, then its a great book! The ingredients are not too complicated and the procedures are not too time consuming. I love the front part of the book that breaks down the different food categories and tells you a little of the history and the health benefits, I love that part! Best of luck to you!"
5,Great product,"We bought this for our two grandchildren, ages 4 and 2, and neither one of them had any problem with the weight difference. The older one was taught how to let her sister ""down"" with ease in a matter of minutes. Grandpa made a platform for the base so that the see saw could be used in the house (they have a pretty big basement) and it would not tip over. The girls are looking forward to warmer weather so they can put it in their back yard. Grandpa was very impressed with the quality of the equipment and actually complemented Gram on what a good purchase she made. I highly recommend this if you are looking for quality, economical, fun stuff for the kids."
5,A breath of fresh air from more serious works on swords.,"I received this as a birthday gift from a savvy friend (right choice!) While not a scholarly study of earlier blades, it completes any serious library on the subject. Its discussions of history, connoisseurship, forging, polishing, furnishing and care succeed in addressing any lingering questions."
4,Good book,"It's a good book, good information!Photos should be color, that's the only thing I don't like!But anyway, I like it!"
5,Yoshindo Yoshihara Sensei,I known this swordsmith in Turin - Italy (April 2005): will showcase some of the phases inherent in the forging of a traditional katana (Japanese sword) using a forge built for the occasion by the master himself.
5,Great for the wannabe bladesmith,"A great book to show, in just as much details as your able to understand, exactly what goes into the production of these beautiful blades. For the young bladesmith wannabe I'd list this as required reading."
4,And his name is Rumpelstiltskin,"The poor miller had no idea what was in store for his daughter when boasted to the king how she has the talent to spin straw into gold. The curious king ordered for his daughter to spin a roomful of straw for that one night only or she would be killed. The distraught daughter cried all by herself when a manikin entered the room and offer a trade to help. on the last night, she had nothing to trade but he wanted her first child when she married the king. The time of course came but the manikin took pity on her, so all he asked is for her to guess his name so he she could keep her child.A great story for little kids."
2,Mildly interesting,"The film raisis some interseting questions, but doesn't offer any answers. It also questions some of it's own opinions."
5,A very thought provoking documentary,"Through all 2 1/2 hours of this fascinating documentary, one can't help but woncer a couple of points:* Was Sirhan Hypnotized aka ""The Manchurian Candidate"" to assassinate Bobby Kennedy?, the fact that he remembers very little about that night lends creedence to this.* How was it that Bobby was heading out of the Auditorium and was re-routed to the pantry where Sirhan JUST HAPPENED to be standing with a gun ready to shoot him. The only way this scenario could have taken place is if the people that led him to the pantry knew he was gonna get shot there or people that told people to lead him there did.Well in any event, I have waited forty years for something about Bobby's death to be published on Video/DVD and it's here..........a must for anyone that lived the expierience."
4,Great footage...Loose ends,"Makes a convincing argument..then undermines its own thesis by the end. One is left with more ambiguity and another dead Kennedy. This raises more questions than it answers: were there CIA handlers at the hotel that night or was it just a group of watch salemen? or were the watch salesmen's creditials and profiles used by substitute killers? These questions are not answered in this video.This reminds me of Al Gore's DVD on ""global warming"". I'm a sucker for video...but in the end the images on the videos (RFK lying mortally wounded and hapless polar bears out for an endless swim) are more powerful, long-lasting, and in a way, deceiving than the pure factual content found on the DVD. The viewers are left with the task of doing their own research which is probably a good idea anyway."
3,Expecting more,"The Delta faucet arrived from Blackman Plumbing Supply Co Inc. It is well built and beautiful. Unfortunately, it isn't a complete system. It still needs some type of universal valve for installation, something not depicted in the photo or description. Items like this if not complete kits, should have some indication of what else is needed to complete installation. This ends up increasing wait time to install as well as an increase in cost I did not anticipate."
5,Great for my rabbit,I got this for my 4.5 lb rabbit to replace another harness he could get out of. I got the smaller size of this harness. It fits him well (and could adjust a good way in either direction) and he doesn't even try to get out of it.
4,Better but still not successful with our Kitty!,"Only regret when opening package was how thin the Harness was.. in picture it looked thick and much more supportive.Much easier to get on Kitty.. but I personally still have trouble with the tiny clasps with my arthritic hands.Our Stanley kept it on for about an hour and then he got out of it... I don't know how.. he is hudini!!!Second purchase to keep him safe.. but he even took off the flea and tick collar we put on just incase he got loose in the yard.. and that was tight...So long story short, if you are ""handy"" this is a much better cat harness than the more confusing ""come along kitty"" one we bought first.They are making a nice colorful collection, however :) Love the pinks and purples!!!"
3,Watch out for Errors in Patterns,"One of the patterns (a gorgeous lace knit design at the end) is FULL of errors. Very frustrating to work with. Other than that, the humpty dumpty pattern is absolutely gorgeous...but impractical as the gorgeous pattern is hidden when the baby wears it. Looks good, but makes all the effort rather wasted. I'm converting the basic pattern design into a pillow or diaper bag side. Much more useful and shows off the design to its fullest.Biggest complaint? While the tiny books are handy, they quickly fall apart and the pages slip and slide all over the place. I've had to clamp mine together with various contraptions. This is my second of the series and both have fallen apart after using only one pattern in each. Bind them better Vogue."
2,Computer looses USB connection to this adapter for now particular reason,"The adapter itself looks ugly and incredibly huge for our days. But it's not the reason to keep me upset. The main reason is that for no reason at all the adapter suddenly goes into sleep mode and I have to reset it (i.e. remove it from the USB slot and put it back in) in order for my computer to recognize it again. I've done just about everything to avoid the problem: disabled power save mode on USB devices in BIOS and in the adapter's hardware settings, I even called their tech support and had it replaced. To no avail. Just in case to make sure that it's not my PC that's doing this, I tested this adapter on 2 other computers (one of which was a laptop) with same results. What really bugs me though, is that Buffalo has no driver updates for this model at all. It's like they made this perfect piece of hardware that needs no maintenance. Well, I guess not."
4,Hot Springs and Pools of the Southwest - purchased through Amazon.com,This is a great book for anyone looking for hot springs in the southwest. Detailed pictures and directions to area springs and pools helped us determine which springs were easily accessible and which were not. We visited several pools in California last year and this year are checking out many more on our way to Arizona.
2,okay shape,the book was not in as good shape as the description indicated. Some of the pages were loose and are falling out of the book. I would not buy from this seller again.
1,Old fashioned Western with Alaskan favor.,A short Western novel with an Alaskan favor. He trys to capture the old Alaskan gold rush days to include them in the development of Morgette. You know the storyline: the good guy usually wins in the end. The fun part is reading to get there.
2,Caliban Engage?,"I have trouble listening to this album; every song sounds near identical to KsE or As I Lay Dying, just not as good. I guess it's actually a pretty solid album, if you don't mind the repetitiveness of the songs and lack of inspiration. Some people may recall that not too long ago, Caliban had their own sound, but this record and the previous have turned them into just another metalcore band."
4,Caliban back w/ a vengeance...,"I just found out a couple of days ago that a new Caliban album was coming out, & I immediately couldn't wait to get my hands on it! Anyway, this is a pretty good album like the last, except it's very straight forward this time around. It doesn't sound as technical, but it's still that heavy sound that you would expect from the band. The only reason why I'm not giving it 5 stars is because I hear way too many similarities to Trivium's brilliant album released last year 'Ascendancy' & As I Lay Dying's awesome 'Shadows are Security.' It sucks that there's too many hardcore bands on the metal scene today, because the same sounds are often repeated & it doesn't help make great bands like I mentioned earlier including Caliban stand out too much. But anyway, this album is still worth it if you love hardcore."
5,great group and cd was perfect.I would buy from amazxon again.,a german band and they are really good. If you like melodic deathcore metal in the lines of killswithch engage you woill like this group. The singinging is really good with crucnching guitars....
5,Garmin Awsome,This garmin was easy to use and never had any problems with it at all. And updating it was easy too. Loved it
4,Battery could last longer if you use a throat mic,"We have many sets of radios as we use them for airsoft and paintballing. When we decided to buy a 2in1 system (GPS and radio) we deicided to look at these. The GPS unit is awesome.When using the radio, I find that the batteries drain a little too fast. We therefore purchased a set of IASUS throat mics online (AMAZON doesn't carry them!) so we could save more battery power. That actually made the unit sound better also! If the radio didn't eat up so much power and sounded better, I would give the Garmin a 5 star."
1,NOT Waterproof,"Used the unit once! I have 3 Garmin Products, two Vehicle GPS and one Personal Wrist Watch GPS, Have always been happy with the company until now. Purchased the unit and went out Kayaking once with it, conditions were windy to calm with some splashing water. When I went to change the batteries I discovered that Water got into the battery compartment, shocked because the unit is advertised as waterproof but should not be too shocked after seeing the thin seal on the compartment. Called Garmin expecting excellent support, as I said I own multiple Garmin Products and have been pleased until now. I was told by the Tech support people that although it is rated waterproof it is only is it is ""standing"" water and up to 1 meter. Apparently splashing water can be forced into the back and damage the unit. IT WAS NOT COVERED by warranty and was told to get a return from the retailer. Extremely dissatisfied customer and will think twice when buying another Garmin product."
2,"Poor radio, small buttons","I purchased the Rino 130 specifically because it also had the radio and NOAA features. Fortunately I read the other reviews on this model as well as the 120 and 110 versions that complained about poor radio performance. I tested the unit and sure enough the radio performance is absolutely terrible, and I was able to return the unit to Amazon in time for a full refund. Be sure to test this yourself. Also the buttons are very small, and the zoom function is impractical as you constantly have to activate the zoom and then slide the zoom level up and down. I returned the Rino 130 and purchased a Garmin Etrex Legend C (color display) for about the same price. I will miss the NOAA feature of the 130 but not the radio. This is an overpriced GPS. Spend the money on a color display unit instead and you will not be disappointed."
4,Good second volume,"While many of the second volumes of the Marvel Essentials have been disappointing, since it seemed Stan Lee got bored and redundant with many of his titles, Spider-Man is an exception. The stories are still very good, and it probably helped that Steve Ditko was plotting many of them. There are some lame characters in here, but also some good storylines. When the art switches to John Romita, it is still excellent. He may have the definitive Spider-Man in my mind."
3,Warning - all graphics are in black and white!,"Where did all the color ink go? Were they trying to save $$? If so, I would have paid the extra cash to retain Spidey's blue and red union suit...Well, at least my dog won't notice the difference."
5,ditko final stories of spider-man,"classic spider-man stories by steve ditko, plus later stories by stan lee and john romita. the difference between the ditko spiderman stories and characters, versus what came after, is brought stunningly into focus when he leaves marvel comics and lee & romita try to continue the magic ... but cannot. ditko's elegant, scientifically brilliant, and clever spiderman devolves into a hero who thinks with his fists instead of his head - what a sad deflation of the greatness that was early spiderman."
1,plz do not buyin this TV,"Many people who watched mine commented on how ""fuzzy"" the picture looked. It's stylish, but falls flat in picture quality. I highly recommend against this poor product from a company with a poor reputation for poor customer support. Check out Cnet's rankings; get a samsung or sony!!"
4,I Love it,This book is helping me to be more aware of the way I talk to my kids and some of the reasons why I get some answers from them. I would love for the Principal and the teachers on their school to have this book handy.
5,The Quickest Way to Learn About Positive Discipline,"Positive Time-Out makes sense to both the parents and child care providers I work with - I love this expanded version and have been using this book for years as door prizes when I have a parenting series for parents with young children. Teaching the value of time-out is an important life skill that is often mis-taught as 'punishment'. Buy this book if you want to re-think why time-out is a positive, necessary, and valuable tool for both adults and children."
5,Best book on Rastafari,"This is the best book I have read so far. Since it is written by a Rasta,who is also a professor, the book reveals deeper insights into the Rasta experience. I especially liked the chapter on Ancient Mystic Foundations. There is alot of info here which I haven't read anywhere else. The chapters on herbal meditation and the Chakras can help you on your road to Enlightenment. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in Rastafari and to those on the Mystic Path."
5,Great Clock Radio,"I've had one of these for a few years and love it. The best feature is the alarm that can be set for specific days of the week. I have it set for M-F and do not have to worry about the unwanted weekend alarm.The only undesirable aspect of the clock is that the background it lit and not the numbers...this can make it a bit more difficult to see the numbers some times.I recently moved and this was one of the casualties of the move so I am looking for another, but would love to find one of these again."
1,Not a good receiver,"I purchased this clock radio several years ago -- and immediately found that it did not receive the radio stations I want, at least not very well. Another radio on the other side of our bed tunes the same stations just fine.I also was annoyed at the beeps generated every time you push a button. I don't want to wakeup my wife when I change something!My daughter just gave me a new Timex Model T308 clock radio to replace the Sony. The Timex works great, installed in the same location as was the Timex."
3,"Solid & well-made, but not quite as advertised","There were some surprises when I received these pans today. One is that there is a color difference between the inside and outside of the pans that is not obvious in the product photo. The inside is silvery, and the outside is dark gray. I'm wondering how this will affect browning. The other difference is that these are advertised as 2"" deep, but they are 1.5"" deep. I wanted 2""-deep pans, but will keep these because I can also use this size. The final surprise is that the silicone handles are essentially on the top only; a little bit of silicone protrudes below, to keep the handle in place, but there is not a full handle underneath. A pot holder will be necessary for pulling these out of the oven."
4,Good stuff!,"Well, Thomas I happen to like the Ramones as well as Sum 41, blink, Green Day, ummm, not so much the Pistols or Hilary Duff for that matter! But I do agree that this is good old, silly, loud friggin rock. Nothing really new here at all. Alice Cooper, the New York Dolls, Twisted Sisiter, Motley Crew were doing this kinda stuff a long time ago, but that's OK! It's good to hear great, loud guitar-based rock without the growling/gurgling vocals that just about all hard rock/metal bands seem to use today to sound... I dunno...sinister? Anyway, I like this, as well as Wednesday 13's solo cd, Fang Bang. Check it out!"
1,"Holy crap, Murderdolls suck","Ok, so my friend really likes Murderdolls so he really tried hard to get me into it. No. Not happening. I gave these guys many chances. I think the musicianship is there. but the one thing that brings these guys down- the singer. What the hell is that. He sounds like hes talking through a voicebox. The guitar riffs are pretty boring too even though i usually like Tripp Eisen's stuff. The main thing they got going for them is Joey, but even thats not enough to save them. If, somehow, you do like the murderdolls, listen to their members side projects(except the singers if he has one) because they are loads better."
5,Vive L'Empereur!!!! Vive La France!!!!,"Simply, THIS BOOK ROCKS!!!!......This is for ALL of us who dream of the Emperor reviewing the Old Guard, with Berthier, Davout, Lannes, etc. at his side....This is the perfect & ultimate illustrated companion for David Chandler's ""Campaigns of Napoleon"", which is the Bible on the Napoleonic Wars! ..The third section of the book which is devoted to the Emperor's Legend and Legacy is worth the price of the book alone, illustrations galore!!...There are two pages of photos, illustrations and text giving the lowdown on the topic of the Emperor's 'little hat'...He purchased over 160 hats from only one merchant in Paris!...So do not hesitate to purchase this wonder of a time machine!.....You will NOT regret it!....."
3,"A good pictorial book, no more","For the diehard Napoleonic fan, this book is NOT the bible on Napoleonic lore. It is filled with good looking pictures (not great looking pictures) and is a nice companion to delve into on Napoleonic poetry, social mores, the legend and various films on Napoleon. Really, a potted history."
4,Great read from the legend,"I really enjoyed reading Arnold's book. What I enjoyed the most was how Arnold told his story, from childhood to present day. Arnold has an amazing story and great knowledge of physical fitness and training. Arnold has worked with the best in the business, from when he first started out as a teen through all of his experiences.I'm going to read it again since I enjoyed it so much. This could almost be considered an autobiography the way it was written."
5,Motivational,"Very motivational and inspiring, plus realistic as far as workouts go. Suprising these days."
4,"Good Story, Not Good Reference","Arnold tells the story of his beginnings, growing up, being in the service, and training around all of these things. Working out in spite of his hectic schedule. Going into the woods for a whole night with a friend and doing 100s of sets of squats, all night long.This book kicks... if you are interested in arnold's life story. If you're looking for a reference guide get the Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding, but if you want to learn more about Arnold then check this out."
2,"New paperback - 2 stars, old paperback - 5 stars","I have make an order of Education of Bodybuilder because my old one /purchased few years ago in London/ did not make it. I have received it and have been very disapointed with the poor quality of photos /which in my old paperback was more than ok/, so I returned it back to the Amazon and I am seriously thinking to buy the older version of E. of BB from Amazon UK.I do not recomend the new edition of this book, go for the older one."
1,"Ho Hum,","I didn't order this book for the training advice as I knew it would be severely lacking, but more for nostalgia reasons, the pictures. Arnold's outlook reflects the day, volume ruled and the lack of reasons behind doing 5 sets per exercise, 20 sets a muscle has no rhyme or reason. It's simply a ""monkey see, monkey do"" mentality.Thankfully, despite commencing my own workouts in the 70's, I happened upon Mike Mentzer who got me off on the right foot... 34 years later and I am still progressing in size and strength. The volume nonsense promoted in Arnold's book would be overkill for 99.9% of the population. And even for the few it does deliver for, there are far better ways to achieve your goals. Seeped in science not hearsay.If you want nostalgia then this book has it...if you want logical training advice, applicable for the average guy with average genetics, void of drug usage, then look towards my mentor; Mike Mentzer."
4,Quick Read,This is a very quick read. It gives a decent look at Arnold in his early years... made me want to know more.
4,Inspirational,"While his ego comes through big-time, Arnold's story is a personal beacon of what single-minded doggedness to a goal can accomplish. I got this for my nephew and we read it together. While neither of us will take this as far as Arnold did, we are both eating and exercising with greater purpose and success in our individual goals."
5,The best book in the world,"I am only 14 years old right now just one year younger than Arnold Schwarzenegger was when he first started bodybuilding. I read some of the book already and it is very motivational. Like Arnold said some days you don't feel like lifting weights because your just lazy, that's true that happens to me a lot. After reading some of this book though I can't believe the motivation I got to just lift weights every day lazy or not. Even if I get lazy some days after reading some of this book I've just decided to tell myself if he could build that much muscle when he started a year older than I am now then I can do that easily. So if 5 is the best rating for this book then I would give it a 10 because it is better than great, and if I haven't even read half of the book then a rating of 10 is honestly the truth."
4,Motivational!,"If you're into bodybuilding or fitness and want to know how to go about visualizing your goals, I highly recommend this book. As a matter of fact, seeing how Arnold's mind worked to allow him to achieve what he has today is motivational for life in general. The first half of the book is devoted to Arnold's summarized life story and how he achieved his goals leading up to his Mr. Olympia victories (though this was written before his final victory in 1980). The second half of the book is devoted to bodybuilding and fitness training. Good stuff."
4,A Classic,"This book was written in the late 1970's. Arnold had just retired from competitive bodybuilding ( though he would have 1 more go at it in 1980's Mr. Olympia).He was a rising star, well known but nowhere near as famous as today. This book is 2 halves. The first half is his autobiography. He talks not just about how he got into musclebuilding, but also his family, his time in the Austrian Army, his goals, his love life,etc. The second half is a how to guide for muscle building. Not bad but needed some work. For instance he lays out a diet to gain weight but doesn't give a plan to lose weight ( other than some basic don't eat junkfood,etc.). Also there wasn't enough about strength training. Still, it's worth it, just to see how he was then."
5,No b.s.,"Simply put, this is when you listen to a champion and all your excuses fall like leaves. Goal set, clear vision and no distractions accepted. If you want to be great, this will sure help."
5,"precise, concise, honest","---------------he was the best because he got rid of people and took enough sythetic testonsterone to out develop his rivals---------------i disagree with the above remark.I have a 1978 edition & to be honest, Arnold admits:- he moved to America because they had better supplements and D R U G S ( yes, drugs. ).- he somewhat prides himself of his detached attitude and so many times admits he just got rid of whomever stood in his way.- he talks briefly about the sordid link between the gay world & the gym world.- he makes a frequent point of his many affairs.However it's not a pulp fiction novel but a motivating essay targeting the mainstream audience."
5,Informative,"It's very informative and my fiance is still reading it but he really loves it and it has helped him dropped some extra pounds that he's been stuck on for a while and gained about 1/2"" on his arms in a month with the work out ideas"
5,Once Again.,I used to have the first publication of this. This one seems to be better than the first. Love this book.
5,IM HERE TO PUMP YOU UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"vERY HONEST! STRAIGHT TO THE POINT AND WENT OUT HIS WAY TO MAKE SURE IT GOT HERE ON THE DATE I NEEDED IT BY. SAME DAY I PURCHASED HE SHIPPED OUT. MY EXPERIENCE WAS MORE THAN GREAT. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!GOD BLESS,JJ-BEAR"
4,Honest and encouraging,"David Chow, having served as a youth pastor in both small churches and megachurches, shares honest lessons from his failures and mess-ups; and then gives insightful glimpses into what true success in ministry involves. If you're thinking about serving in youth ministry, check this book out. It'll help you stay on track amid the potholes of reality. A quick-read that's worth the time."
3,comfort is very good,The durability of the internal mechanics is poor because its not very water resistant and battery cover broke easily. Comfort of shoe is awesome. Durability of shoe very good. Overall very impressed. If they could fix the battery cover and make the mechanics water proof I would never buy another shoe.
2,This is NOT the movie!,"I was looking for the dambusters movie. This is not it. I have not watched much of it yet. It is critical of the raid and the bit I saw refers to the ""terrorism"" against Germany. Not in the spirit of the movie or the truth as I understand it."
1,Inaccurate DVD,"The squadron identification letters on the side of the Avro Lancaster shown in the picture are wrong. 617 Squadron's letters were AJ (and still are to my knowledge, as 617 The Dambusters are still an operational RAF Squadron flying Tornados). If the producers can't even get that basic fact right then how can we rely on the rest the content? My tip, watch the 1954 movie The Dambusters, it follows the true story very closely!"
5,An Appropriately Titled Book,A great book for anyone in any business. I find myself reflecting back to it often to stimulate thinking. It is an after action review of success and failure in past and current businesses. An excellant source for insight into intelligent business thinking.
5,The Ultimate Cookbook,"This cookbook is AWESOME! It has every recipe that you could possibly want or need. The cool part is that they explain everything, including how to cut an onion and not cry and why it works. And to top it off, they not only tested recipes over and over, but tested different kinds of cooking equipment over and over and then give reviews. I liked it sooo much that I'm back buying one for a friend for Christmas. Happy Holidays!"
4,Fool-Proof,I have this cookbook and have tried a number of recipes. Each time the recipe is a success. Instructions are straight-forward and easy to follow. I bought it as a gift and kept it for myself....have to buy another one for a December birthday.
4,5 star recipes......no stars for the index....,"I agree with all the five star reviews, except for one thing....the index is very difficult to read.....I went through with a marker and drew in divisions between the alphabet sections, and put a header on each page, but it is still tedious......I suggest in future editions the authors use varying type face, and different font sizes to distinguish between topics and subtopics. I have at least a hundred cook books, and this is the first one I reach for."
4,Good Standard Recipes,"This is not a cook book one looks to for new recipes, rather it is a cook book that will tell you the best way to do something basic, like cooking a turkey. It is also a really interesting read for those who are really anal about finding the best way to do something, in this case cook (the title is apt.) The book is not strong on using innovative ingredients or the preparation of interesting new dishes, but hey! this is a book that will tell you how to do the basics, which is always good.This Thanksgiving I followed the recipe for cooking a turkey. I innovated a little, like adding garlic, but basically I did everything they said. It was the best turkey I have ever had. It was so good that my mother called me months later to find out how I made it."
4,The Best Recipe Cook Book,"I think this Cookbook is wonderful, great recipes. The only thing I have against it is that all pictures of recipes (except) the front cover are all black and white. I personaly do not mind paying a little more to get the pictures in color they are much more appealing and this makes you want to make the receipe. I also feel that you should tell people when they are in color and also when they are not."
4,The Definitive Essential Cookbook,"I almost hesitate to advise people to buy this book, for the selfish reason of wanting to hoard these cooking secrets. Seriously, though, I have learned skills and methods I had never seen elsewhere, and it has improved my cooking immensely. It wasn't that bad before! I have successfully made many recipes from this book and have found in most cases it IS ""the Best Recipe."" Before I cook anything from another cookbook, I cross-check against The Best Recipe first. Everyone who loves to cook and takes pride in flawless execution should own this book.The only thing that could possibly improve TBR would be a full color illustration and photo section."
5,AWESOME Cookbook!,"I have been so pleased with this cookbook - I bought it about a year ago and it has fast become my new favorite. Every time I make a recipe from this book, the recipe becomes a new favorite. Last night I had friends over and made the ""Rich and Creamy Cheesecake"" recipe. I am a cheesecake fan and have probably eaten more cheesecake in my life than I should admit. The recipe in this book was honestly BY FAR the best cheesecake I have ever tasted in my entire life - even better than I have eaten at gourmet restaurants. It was mind-blowingly delicious. That's just one example of the wonderful experiences I have had using this book. The recipes are not difficult either. The directions are very clear and I like how they preface each recipe with an explanation of how they formulated it to be the ""best recipe"".I can't recommend this book highly enough!"
5,Larry the chef,"Best French toast ever.The lead ins where different attempts, recipe tweaks, and cooking times are discussed are the most valuable.and I agree that the index needs a lot of layout work."
5,If you want PERFECT food...,"Cooks Magazine is for people who want to UNDERSTAND basic food, and perfect it. You'll learn about chemical reactions, and what makes food work, so that you can fly on your own when it comes to cooking, instead of being chained to an incomprehensible recipe. Unlike ""Bon Appetit,"" Cooks will teach you technique and what makes good equipment, all part of cooking perfection. The Best Recipe is a stunning tribute to this type of cooking, and you will find yourself reading it like a novel, underlining key passages along the way. There is more to being a great cook than having a good recipe from some flashy magazine with artistic food photos. From focaccia to buttermilk biscuits, or mac and cheese to braised lamb shanks, this book teaches you a lot. You will be amazed at the food you can turn out with this volume by your side. And at $20, it is the cheapest food course you could ever enroll in."
3,"Good, but not great for beginners","A great example of testing and tasting resulting in good food -- and an excellent read for a scientific analysis of recipes.However, while I found that the recipes taste great, I found that the cookbook wasn't that user-friendly. I definitely wouldn't recommend it for beginners. It provides a lot of analysis of different methods of cooking each recipe, but to a novice, much of this information won't mean much.If you are interested in a truly in-depth look at recipes, I recommend this book, especially if you are at the point where you tinker with your own recipes to help them reach perfection. Before that stage -- for someone who is getting started and wants to learn basic cooking methods and great recipes, I prefer books by Mark Bittman."
4,Even though the title bothers me...,"At this point, Cook's Illustrated Magazine has overused the words ""best"" and ""perfect"" to the point of irrelevance. Nevertheless, this is a great cookbook. It's well-organized -- so much so that the index is almost unnecessary. The recipes are solid and, most importantly, their development is well-documented. The latter helps you learn and grow as a cook, which is really the whole point, n'est-ce pas? A nice gift for any cook, armchair or otherwise."
3,Excellent receipes; poorly indexed.,I found the book to have excellent recipes when I can find what I am looking for. The publishers need to redo the indexing on the book.
2,Poorly organized,"I rated this cookbook only two stars for a simple reason: poor organization. It is impossible to find anything in this book, especially if you're in a hurry. The Table of Contents is so sparse (only listing major sections like ""Poultry"") that you literally have to hunt through each chapter. (There isn't any additional content listing at the beginning of the chapters, either.)Also, the book claims to have test some recipes 80 times but they can't even give you the courtesy of providing an estimated preparation time.There is some nice bonus information like Science Facts and recipe variations, but unfortunately because of the layout it all blends in together."
5,"""The Best Recipe"" is a pretty ambitious title but...","It's an ambitious title, but the book lives it up! I suppose honestly I can only speak for teh recipes in the deserts and cookies sections, but wow! I've been searching for the perfect chewy peanut butter cookie recipe, molasses crinkle, and plain round sugar cookie recipe... and here they are! The sugar cookies turned out absolutely amazing - crisp edges with a soft, chewy center, super flavor.What I really like, though, are the explanations (usually about three to four times as long as the recipe itself) or what went on to get the best recipe. These say a lot about what's really going on, which is great if you're into majorly altering recipes to get exactly what you want.Amazing! Highly recommended! (Although maybe go for the new edition, it has more goodness added to it.)"
5,So glad I got this!,"I have really enjoyed having this book. It is fascinating just to sit and read the articles. I've learned so much about cooking and baking just doing that. And the recipes are clear and the few I've had a chance to try so far give GREAT results. I've made wonderful roast beef, sauteed chicken breasts, and (let angels sing) delicious homemade bread in less than 2 hours. I'm very much looking forward to trying many more of these recipes, including some I've never tried, like corned beef from scratch, sponge cake, fallen chocolate cake, rice pudding, REAL snickerdoodles.... the list goes on. If you're interested in cooking and/or baking, you will love this book. It's not by any means comprehensive (most noticeably to me, the beans and grains section seems kind of sparse), but what it covers, it covers very well."
5,Make Cooking a Joy again!,"I love this cookbook and intend on getting it for gifts as well. I used to dread cooking but now I can find recipes that have basic ingredients and taste great! This book proves things don't have to be complicated to be great. I've made the oven-fried chicken, the beef stew and the sauteed chicken breasts. I love all the explanations--someone already did all the experimenting so I can be assured of the best recipe. This is my first book review and my enthusiasm for this book inspired me to write it!"
4,Excellent Cooking Teacher,"My sister bought this book for me, and our 4 Sister's-in-Law, all of whom are excellent cooks. We RAVE about this book. For one thing, it explains WHY they selected each recipe, after experimenting with the better of several recipes, then they add in some variations to provide you with the guidelines to ""make it your own.""I've learned SO MUCH about what ingredients--and timing-- do to alter the outcome of recipes; whether they're baking, grilling, or sauteing.The only limitation is space, so they can't go on and on. But, if you only bought ONE cookbook for your favorite cook, give them this one. They'll pleasure you forever..."
2,Let the Chef Beware,"This is a great book on the surface, but my copy is full of margin notes, because the recipes (especially meat and chicken) are rarely cooked through using the times given in the book. This means that I have had many meals where I timed everything to be finished simultaneously, only to find that the chicken or turkey was still not finished. A very frustrating experience at times."
2,"Works, after a fashion.","The basic idea is good--it will collect spider webs--but there are some significant design problems. When the tip contacts a surface (which it will when collecting webs off walls and ceilings) the friction causes the unit to stall. The extending rod (about the size and thickness of a portable radio whip antenna) is insufficiently rigid to support the plastic collecting tip in operation. This leads to severe oscillations and makes collecting small fine webs clumsy. The motor is too seriously underpowered to overcome either the friction or the oscillations, and half the time in use is spent waiting for the unit to spin back up to speed."
4,Does the job,This works good as long as you leave it in one place. If you are going to move it around a lot I would get something more sturdy.When you pick this up the outer rail flexes.And if you leave it outside the screen rusts even though it's covered up.Other than that you can make a good sized fire in this.
3,"Nice Fireplace for small fires, s'mores, etc.","This is a nice medium-sized outdoor fireplace unit. I think it's best suited for small fires, roasting marshmallows, etc. The lower (firebox) and legs are sturdy if you bolt them up correctly. The top (fire screen) is less sturdy, but works fine for light and moderate use. I think it's a nice looking unit and looks true to the image, though in reality it is not a stout as it might appear in the photo, and the perimeter rail is not solid, but sectional, and does not have the smoothest seams when assembled. If you are looking for a bomb-proof outdoor fireplace for constant use, this is not the right unit. It will, however, work very nicely for the occasional fire and s'more gathering, which is all that we needed."
1,"Cheap, poorly made","Very thin metal, flimsy top, this MIGHT last six months, if I dont use it much. I purchased this because I liked the screen top and size. Item I received was poorly made of cheap materials, yes made in China. Find something else, you wont like this."
4,BIG Firepit!,"Very large, heavy but not TOO heavy, easy to assemble. I would give it 4.5 stars if a half star was allowed. Only issue was that the very first time I started to raise the front panel the hinge broke off. However, Customer Service was very pleasant about it and a replacement panel arrived in a couple of days. No problems whatsoever with the new front and top panel hinges."
5,The best bioregional biography I've seen,"Sherman's excellent book was recommended to me by a colleague while I was preparing to teach a college course in bioregional biographies, and it is clearly the best I've seen. His rendering of geological, botanical, and biological information is both lucid and lyrical, and--unlike David Raines Wallace, whose Klamath Knot is also a wonderful model of this sort of writing--Sherman needs no incidental narrative device to hold the layers of deep history together. Mr. Sherman is a gifted writer and naturalist, and A Place on the Glacial Till is clearly a classic of natural history writing."
1,Worst book I ever read,"This book is only the material for author's classes.If you read the book just for your reseach, you will find many loophole in the contents. Many explanations are skipped so it's very hard to understand the author's intention in this book.Thank you."
1,Not the original artists,I feel as though I got ripped off. This CD is a compilation of one hit wonders that are performed by no names.
4,Not bad at all,I have been taking prenatal yoga classes and this dvd is a exactly what it's titled - it's a quick fix of prenatal yoga classes. I wish that it came with the necessary yoga equipment but this plus a mat and ball would make an excellent pregnancy gift for expectant mothers!
3,Okay but others are much better.,"I had several pregnancy workout videos on VHS but got this one cause I am trying to gets some on DVD. Its okay but seams kind of sloppy. The timer at the bottom of the screen that counts down for each 10 minute segment was a nice feature. The upper body and lower body sections are great and not too hard but you really feel it. However, it seems she just muddled through the core section without properly explaining the exercises. The Liesa Hart FitMama is a much better overall workout. I also really like my old The Method: Pre-natal workout."
3,decent pants for the price,I bought these pants for my husband for him to wear on his softball rec team. They are well priced but a little thin. I think that it'd be better for him to wear something under the pants (spandex or shorts). But overall okay quality!
5,easy to use and great for educational purposes,"The Autostar is so decadent! I almost feel guilty for using it. But it is so easy to use and enhances the ETX-90EC scope so much that I use it all the time.Set-up and locating the reference stars is fairly easy, and it is so much fun to take the tour of the sky. I've used this several times in an educational setting and it is fantastic for quickly pointing out stars and other celestial objects. In addition, it expands on the standard controller, giving you nine variable speeds instead of the standard four.Once you use the Autostar you will never go back."
5,"Powerful and inexpensive, but it's a computer - be prepared","""Goto"" Telescopes and controllers have been around for quite a number of years now, but are normally very expensive. The Autostar has 95% of the functionality of the expensive hardware at a small fraction of their price.I think that Meade has done an excellent job of making this device user-friendly. However, it's a powerful tool, and it will take some serious attention on your part to make it work to even a fraction of it's potential. One big advantage the Autostar has over the competitors ""goto"" controller is that fact that Meade is constantly updating and improving the firmware. Get the #505 cable, or make your own for a few bucks and you'll also be able to load in newly discovered comets or customized sky tours.Although many novices will find it confusing, the Autostar can actually be easier to use than the more advanced and higher priced controllers used on much more expensive telescopes."
2,Autostar for Dummies? Where is it? I'll buy.,"I'm a rank astronomy novice. I read the Autostar manual word for word twice before I dared to hook it to my ETX-90 scope. So far the Autostar is far far too complicated for this CPA, MBA to understand. The computer seems very slow to respond to commands. Maybe if I read the Autostar manual another dozen times I'll figure some of it out. Meanwhile I'll use the simple controller that came with my scope. I understand that remote completely."
1,notagooddeal,This price is about the going retail rate from my local dealer. AND I don't have to buy a gazillion. Not worth considering.
1,Formatted wrong for use in the states,"After receiving the item and not being able to play the DVD I read some other reviews and found out this particular Wishbone Ash, 40th Anniversary Concert, is formatted in PAL, and can't be played on DVD players here in the U.S., unless your machine has that capability. Not knowledgeable enough on DVD players to say anything further. I can't comment on how good the DVD is since I haven't viewed it. I did order the 30th Anniversary DVD, through Amazon,and I had no problems playing it and I believe it's worth getting if you are a Wishbone Ash fan.I was issued a refund from the seller after notifying them of the problem and would not have a problem dealing with the same seller or Amazon, in the future, although I don't understand why Amazon would be offering this DVD when there is a known problem about its playability in the states."
4,Hey! It's Wishbone Ash,"Well, Amazon is jammin me up to review this but I ain't seen it yet. The vendor did great arrived on time. I got a good deal on the DVD as I recall. I will update this after I have seen the show. Cheers"
3,decent,It's a decent little tool for the price. I wouldn't mind if it were larger and clearer in the markings.
2,Not worth it.,This product is VERY cheaply made. I was disappointed when I received it to find that it's just a printed piece of paper inside the glass for the hydrometer portion. I will be purchasing something else.Don't waste your money.
4,Good suppliment to Leisa Hart FitMama,"I use this as a supplement to my FitMama Dvd. I am an intermediate excerciser, and in pretty good shape. I liked the pre-natal disk. There are 3/ 10 minute toning workouts for lower body,arms,and abs. The lower body & arms are really good.I don't really care for the abs section much. My only complaint is that she is a little annoying which can be ignored, and she tells you to hold your breath for way to long which is not good for you. Otherwise it's really good for toning. I only watched the Post-natal but it looks like it's probably just as good. These are good for maintaining your current level of toning, and probably won't get you into shape unless you normally don't excercise at all."
2,not the happiest workout,"This is not my favorite. A bit stiff and not much bang for your 10-min buck. As mommy of 2 toddlers, I need to get all I can in in those 10 minutes.I didn't find the instructor warm or motivating. I much prefer the 10-minute solution workouts.The disc didn't work well and I couldn't get through a workout without it skipping or sticking--but the seller was right on top of a refund for me--no complaints about them and would order through them again."
3,Good but not good enough,"This album was a good idea, from the time you start listening you hear some descent styles but when the CD stops you find yourself desperate for more, the albums length is a sin. I won't reccommend this album if you are not a hardcore reggae fan but if you enjoy the music this album would be a great addition to your collection."
1,awful awful awful awful,"I agree with the other negative reviews -- this is without a doubt the single worst adoption book for kids I have ever read -- and, as an adoptive mom, I've read quite a few. I just got back from a meeting of my adoption support group, at which we compared notes on children's adoption books, and our group was unanimous in our dislike for this book. None of us (five families) would ever read this book to our kids. This book presents adoption as a big problem, something so upsetting it causes the adopted child to run away. I prefer books that explain adoption without implying that it's something to be upset about. If you're looking for a good book on transracial adoption, get ""Families Are Different"" by Nina Pellegrini instead."
1,Hordes of better adoption stories out there,"I thought Our Twitchy was a great example of how NOT to handle adoption. Unlike Twitchy's parents, many, if not most, adoptive parents today share the story of how they became a family with their children from babyhood on, thus curtailing any big revelations and strong reactions like poor Twitchy had. And why did it take the whole book before Twitchy's parents finally reassured him that they were indeed his real parents??As an adoptive parent, this is one book I will never share with my child."
1,I'd give it 0 if I could.How not to write an adoption story.,"This is a cruel, heartless, sloppily written book.It is not good to keep adoption a secret,and make the poor child discover it for himself!(see a previous review)In addition, the voice makes no sense. It is not possible to tell who is talking for several pages.Hope this rushes to out of print."
5,Great book,This book is very helpful for not only learning to play but also the theory of music on the banjo.
3,gets you going,"I wanted to play the banjo, but without a background in music, and start making music...This book had me playing simple songs from the start...I don't think this is for anyone but a true beginner..when you progress a bit, you will need an instructor imo.."
5,using the banjo book,"I am finding this book to be very helpful as I learn the banjo for the first time. It is very informative so far and useful for the begginer or a more advanced player. The explaining is done very well, and easy to read. I also find the youtube videos to be helpful by this author."
3,"Okay, but there are better things out there.","I bought this to try to teach myself claw hammer. It was okay . . . a little too slow moving perhaps, and I don't care about all the Tao stuff. I have read and enjoyed the Tao te Ching, but I try to keep it Taoism and Banjo separate.I found Mike Seeger's(rest in peace) DVDs much more helpful.Southern Banjo Styles Volumes 1, 2, & 3 are great. The tunes and the wide variety of techniques are more interesting than what's contained in The How and the Tao of Old Time Banjo, in my opinion. Seeger's DVDs come with tabs (which I found unnecessary) and a well-selected list of ""essential"" old time banjo albums.The How and Tao isn't bad at all, but I think Seeger's DVDs are a better alternative."
5,Excellent,I purchased this book as a present for my father who is learning the banjo and has been for quite a while. He has tried several books and tells me that this is the best by far. He advised me the book is set out in a way which is easy to follow and informative.The Shipping was fine and arrived on time.
5,The Best and Easiest Method Out There,"The How and Tao of Old Time Banjo is simply the best book on frailing/clawhammer on the market. I spent tons of money and time with instruction books and private lessons and got no where fast. This book makes it all clear and had me playing in no time. I've been a professional musician for years and wanted to get that bump-ditty sound on the banjo and this did it! I've played all over the mid-west, Ireland and England and everyone asks where I learned to play. This is simply a must-have for anyone who wants to cut through incomprehensible instruction manuals and wants to get down to learning how to play...fast...and good."
5,The How and Tao of Old Time Banjo,"This book starts out simply, goes on with advice, help, and alot of songs to try. It then continues with more advanced techniques. It is written in a relaxed style and doesn't require that the reader have a degree in music to understand it, yet has enough information in it to help a student of the banjo for many years. All you need besides this book is a banjo (and some strings from time to time)."
3,banjo,"well illustrated, with clear instructions.However, in my opinion, the instructions could go a little furtherin the direction of working on the assumption that the recipient knows absolutely nothing, as in my case."
3,"This stroller is OK, but not great","This is our main stroller, and it has it's good points - it's very lightweight, fits easily in the car, and it looks jazzy. But it's hard to push if you have your hands full - if you use just one hand, the front wheels tend to spin perpendicular to the stroller so you can't move. And the seat doesn't sit fully upright so I feel like my daughter is always lounged. The straps are perpetually twisted. The basket is pretty small and it has no drink holder, but those aren't big deals to me. Also, the handles are on the low side - I'm 5'6"" and this hurts my back after a bit. It would be great as a spare or travel only stroller but for regular outings it's a little annoying. We also have a jogger, which is great for the outdoors, but not for the mall - and I'm not investing in yet a 3rd stroller to serve that purpose."
3,Awesome stroller if you don't need anything else...,"I love Combi strollers, but actually went with a Graco after trying out a bunch of strollers (we had a Combi, then got rid of it).Combi has great strollers, but if you need basket room, forget it. There is NONE. I can't even fit my SMALL diaper bag in it.That being said, these are INCREDIBLY lightweight, SUPEREASY to fold down, and really don't take up much space. If you just need a lightweight umbrella type, Combi is THE WAY to go!!"
4,Gotta Have It!,"We should have bought this stroller many months ago. My 5 month old loves this stroller. It is so lightweight and portable. It is great for traveling, becasue it takes up little space. It is worth the money to have this Combi at hand. It is easy to maneuver and seems to be comfy for the baby as well. The only drawback is there the storage basket inderneath. You cannot fit much into it, but this a minor concern. You just gotta have this stroller!!!"
3,Light weight but not easy to stear,Pros:- Light Weightfolding is easyeasy to carry in and out of carRemovable bar in the frontNice paddingSmall basket fits a lotCons:-MUSt use TWO hands for straringCan be difficult to pushNo place to keep a bottle
1,do not buy this stroller,"what junk, i have a cheapie stroller that has better wheels..the shading cover is also worthless, i felt ripped off when i made the mistake of buying this."
2,Just an OK stroller,"I had been very excited when I got this stroller for my baby shower. I really liked the light weight and I had the carseat that goes with this stroller. Yes, it was definately a convenience when I had to go out the first few months. But now a year later, the wheels really do not push well. For me, it does not push well on smooth or uneven surfaces. Whenever I am in a store the wheels are always sticking. I have finally decided to retire this stroller. And I'll be getting a chicco umbrella stroler instead. One of my friends has one so I tried it before I bought it. The wheels and steering are great on it!!! But I had expected the be using the Combi for quite a bit longer than I had. If I had to buy something initially I think I would have gone with Peg Perego or Maclaren.Sorry Combi...I really wanted to love this stroller."
4,"Not as good as the first book, but still recommended!","This second book is more about angelique's machinations behind the scenes, as she attempts to destroy Barnabas Collins by bringing in a strong rival vampire, Rathburn, to steal Victoria Winters away. Rathburn realizes what is going on, and joins forces with Barnabas to get Angelique.A bit rambling at times, and one wishes for more of Barnabas, but a good book overall.By the way, there are some in-jokes for series fans: The Pennock Supper Club (actor Chris Pennock was on DARK SHADOWS); ""Mr. DiCenzo, the lawyer"" (assistant producer George DiCenzo); and ""Gordon Collins"" (Gordon Russell was one of the writers). There may be more..."
3,"Good, if somewhat ill-focused.","The authors are to be commended for their convincing detail about the Collins Family. (In that regard, they surpass Lara Parker's effort, which had one embarrassing lapse.) Another plus: they've worked into the novel a surprising number of ""in jokes"" that fans of the original series will no doubt pick up on and enjoy. That said, however, I found this novel somewhat wanting a fixed point of view. While the characterization of Thomas Rathburn was compelling, it came at the expense of the character of Barnabas -- and this seemed insensitive to the reader, who had every reason to expect the novel would more prominently feature the Collinses. For all his angst, Barnabas remains an elusive guy to write about. I'd certainly like to see future works by these authors in the DS-genre, but I hope that they'll focus on Collinwood's primary inhabitants."
3,"SOLID READ, IF LACKING IN EXECUTION","This was a pleasant read and can ""stand alone"" as a genre vampire novel. The character of Thomas Rathburn is intriguing, well-presented. Unfortunately, the emphasis on the new (and un-continuing) Rathburn character necessarily detracts from the Collinses. Scant mention is afforded to many of the family members, including Barnabas, the ostensible centerpiece. Although the authors do not repeat Ms. Parker's embarassing lapses of character relationships, neither do they engender much interest in Barnabas, Roger, Elizabeth, et al. The authors do have a sophisticated style, however, and a sly sense of humor, as evidenced in their frequent in-jokes that fans of the original series will enjoy."
2,Fair in comparison to the first of the series,"DREAMS OF THE DARK was interesting. However, I feel Lara Parker's passion for the project captures the concept in a fuller sense. Her quality writing is a cut above what is presented here. If HarperCollins is smart and no offense against Mr. Rainey, they should give the recurring writer's role to Miss Parker, who auditioned brilliantly with ANGELIQUES'S DESCENT."
1,Paint By Numbers Spin Off,"This series was off to a good start with Lara Parker's take on ""Angelique"", but this follow up is an embarrassment. The editors of this series would be better off nurturing stories that expand and contribute to the existing Collins Mythos as did ""Descent"". The change in character of Victoria Winters was inexcusable and the description of her in the vampire's embrace completely out of sync with the original series. The tacked-on revelation of Vicki's birthright in the final chapter was, like this entire ordeal, uninspired. An entire novel could be devoted to exploring her link to the Collins family, and in keeping with the spirit of Dark Shadows should be far more sinister and complicated than this undeveloped explanation. Die hard fans are only fooling themselves if they find this to be a valid contribution to the Dark Shadows legacy."
1,I feel like I wasted my money on this book..,"I have wasted even more money because I've had to throw out so much that was just awful! I did fix a couple of things that we liked like the 90 minute rolls but most of it I had to throw out. I'm very disappointed. Not much, if any, flavor in any of the recipes I tried. I'm glad so many others have liked it but it just really wasn't for my family."
3,Barlow lens review,Did not have much time to use the Barlow lensbut the time I did the image was a bit blurry.Delivery was perfect .
2,Product works but the supplier is unethical,"I ordered two tubes of the salve for about $5.00 each and was astounded when I saw the bottom line. The supplier had charged me about $15 for a small flat rate Priority mailer with a normal mailing cost of about $6.00. I live overseas where OTC meds are not easy to find or to identify, so buying items like this through the US Government mail is my best option. However, being charged postage fees that equal more than the initial cost of the product (and twice what the USPS charges) is not acceptable. I will in the future impose upon my family to send necessary items to me. That way we can all benefit from the product in question."
5,Higher quality than I expected,This pendant is made of nice metal and seems very sturdy and well made. The string is adjustable and my son loves it.
5,Tape,Permanant white tape cassetts are easy to install.The tape prints and sticks well.You can even write 2 lines on the 3/8 inch tape.
2,"marketing @ 50,000 ft.","If you know absolutely nothing about professional services marketing and work for a small, local accounting firm, then this book may interest you. Gives a very general understanding of marketing concepts but not enough to really help you do anything. If you work for a Big 5, don't waste your time with this book."
2,Cute but....,"These shoes are so cute but, they are THE MOST uncomfortable shoes I have ever had! I had to send them back.Leather was too stiff, back of heel was too short and kept slipping off of my foot, and there was not padding at all for ball of foot. I added petals ball of foot pads and back of heel pads and they made no difference."
2,pretty but unwearable,"I bought these in black last year and I was so excited when I opened the box--they are gorgeous!Sadly I was too vain to send them back, because now I have a beautiful shoe that only sits in my closet. They are just too uncomfortable to wear. First, all your weight goes to the forefoot and the straps dig horribly into your toes. Second, the heel slips off your foot in the back, making them difficult to walk in. Third, there is no cushioning in the forefoot nor is there room to place a gel insert (my feet are narrow and yet they are squeezed under the straps in this shoe).I do wear pumps regularly and have a respectable collection, but these must be the most uncomfortable and unbearable ones I own. Strongly recommend that you pass these by!"
5,A welcome mat for everyone,"Now there's a way for people unfmailiar with Billy get an overview of his music from above. I've loved his lyrical abilities and evocative music that fuses both a folkie sensibility and a gritty modern edge for a long time. Very few other present day bands can do this well. Outgrabe is one of the most successful, and they've clearly been influenced by Billy, the grand old man of this genre. I wish Billy all the luck in the world, and I'm sure this CD will draw new fans into his musical space."
1,A POOR MAN's WOODY GUTHRIE.,"Billy Bragg thinks he's a modern day Woody Guthrie, championing the poor working class. Unfortunately he is not.Not only is he a hypocrite by writing for the right wing press when it suits him, but i find his 'right on' attitude rather nauseating. This is a man that supports a certain Mr Blair and is proud to do so. Therefore i fine his music rather patronising to people that (unlike him) are really struggling. Mr Bragg wouldn't know real suffering if it crawled up and bit him. At least Steve Earle walks it like he talks it! Beware of songwriters who claim to be working class they invariably aren't!"
5,Only soap I use.,It seems to help with adult acne. I have very sensitive face and I tend to break out with most soaps. Not this one though so I'll stick to it.
3,Expired Soap,"Had high hopes for this soap but received it and the expiration date on it is March 2011 and it's December 2011. Oh well, just will use it for washing my hands! Will not order again."
5,An Absolutely Indispensable Baseball Guide,"After traveling to most of the ballparks in this country for our own ballpark website my only regret looking back is that this book wasn't available from the start! This is perfect for anyone who wants to see the ballparks of the Major Leagues (and actually it's perfect for anyone who just loves ballparks). The book is chock full of beautiful glossy photographs and details about the ballpark and it's surroundings. It will let you know before purchasing your tickets where the best seats for the money are, so you can get the best bang for your buck. With the price of tickets these days, this information alone is worth it's weight in gold. Interesting facts and a list of likes and dislikes makes great reading for anyone who simply just loves baseball. An absolute must have for the ballpark pro or for someone who just loves the game..."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING!,I baked a chicken in this and it completely stuck to the pan on the first use! Very disappointed in this pan. I expected much more from the Cuisinart brand.
2,What's All the Fuss About?,"A handful of reviewers (including, surprisingly, David Hurwitz of ClassicsToday.com) gush like schoolgirls over this recording, but the actual experience falls way short. Janacek's Sinfonietta requires a powerhouse virtuoso orchestra, which the Czech Philharmonic isn't. The most striking music of the Sinfonietta--the opening brass fanfare and its fully-orchestrated version at the end of the piece--are hideously out of tune, with poor tone qualities to boot. Bad intonation and ensemble are the rule in this digital tragedy. While the disc benefits from the two lesser-known works by Martinu, it's still not worth the price. There are dozens of better recordings of the Janacek (like the Chicago Symphony with Ozawa and Vienna with Kubelik), so spare yourself the sore ears and buy elsewhere."
1,Too small,I returned this camera case because it will not hold the FZ8 and the lens adapter plus the sun shield that come with the camera. I purchased a polarizing filter and I couldn't even get it inside the camera case without possibly damaging it by forcing the compartment closed. It did hold the extra battery nicely. For my needs it won't work. If you don't use the lens adapter or sun shield or a filter then this is probably what you want.
1,Sleek look but POOR DESIGN,"Don't let the sleek look of this camera case fool you--it is WAY TOO SMALL for the camera and there is no chance of fitting an extra battery pack or any other accessories. I am returning my bag to Amazon for fear of damaging the camera by forcing the bag shut--mind you this is supposed to be a bag MADE for the LUMIX camera--clearly there was some mis-steps in manufacturing this one.Another problem is the way the bag opens and shuts--there are 2 side zippers and a velcro closure at the top--too many steps when trying to catch a picture perfect moment. The 2 zippers do not even meet--they end where the velcro strip begins. Also, the velcro strip gets in the way when you are trying to return the camera to the bag.I love the eye-catching metallic blue color of this bag but this is not the right bag for the Lumix. Keep searching!!"
4,"Mmmm, Dark Phoenix","Definately one of the best storylines in the history of comics, 'The Dark Phoenix' saga is also one of my favourites. I've been a fan of the X-men since the late 80's, and with back issues being so expensive, these collections are the best way to go. Whether you're reading these issues again, or for the first time, it's a great way to do it."
4,Trapped in a World they Never Made....,"With the X-men movie lighting up the box office, there is no better time than the present for new fans to be introduced to the classic past of this long-running comic title. ""The Essential X-Men Vol. 2"" delivers, nicely covering the terrific Chris Claremont/John Byrne run which resurrected the X-Men and made the book must reading for a generation of comics fans.The collection features the most tumultuous and terrific two years of the dynamic duo's run on the book, including the legendary ""Dark Phoenix"" saga and ""Days of Future Past"". During this run (Uncanny X-Men 120-144), Claremont turned up the realism and alienation a couple of notches and delivered some incredible stories. John Byrne's art is bold and detailed (the black and white presentation here only reinforces his fine pencils).If the movie left you hungering for more X-Men (and the current spate of mutant books left you cold), check out this collection and see what made this such a great book."
4,More of the best!,"Ok, first of all, ""only"" 4 stars, and that's based on the packaging (black'n'white + cheap paper), not on the quality of the material.These are more of the classic X-men stories that turned Chris Claremont into a comic-book superstar. Found within are some of the best stories ever written, the ""Dark Phoenix Saga"" and ""Days of Future Past"", stories that by far and wide supercedes anything else written in those early days of the ""modern"" comic-book.John Byrnes art is flawless, and manages to almost look as good in black and white as it does in it's original glorious coloring.Quite simply, buy this if you are at all remotely interested in the X-Men. There are 4 issues in this series of ""Essential"" X-Men, but this one is probably the one that has the most to offer for a new fan. Heck, buy 2 and give one to a friend!"
2,"Love the story, but this is a bargain phonebook version.","I was hoping to get a reading/thrash copy to stop the wear and tear on my issues, but had to return this. It's B&W, and printed on very thin cheap newspaper, and is, essentially, the bargain-basement manga version of the X-Men. If you've never seen the Byrne/Claremont run before, this is a nice, inexpensive way to rip right through some of the best stories our Children of the Atom ever had (including the introduction of Alpha Flight, and the Dark Phoenix Saga), but archival-quality, this ain't."
5,Travel workhorse,"I bought this as a birthday gift for a friend who travels at least 45 weeks every year on business. Everywhere he goes, ths kit goes with him, and is doing yeoman service."
4,mthomas,This DVD Set was given as a gift. The recipient was thrilled with it and gave great reviews on the contents.
1,Misleading Title,"This book, like Bill's earlier one, deals mostly with detailing of models (geometry) only. It does not discuss materials in depth, or lighting, Global Illumination etc. So a large part of what makes scenes photrealistic is not touched upon. More importantly, his geometry detailing techniques will no doubt add a couple of zillion polygons. No discussion on that either- no scheme is presented to keep a count of polygons, or keep them within sensible limits.Without proper lighting and materials, Bill does not really produce photorealistic results.The description of imaginary worlds and creatures is unimaginative and tedious.The underlying principles are noteworthy, but could be summarised in one page- which i think Bill *has* done: it's there somewhere on the net."
1,Rehashed is a more accurate description,What a waste of money. It's barely worth the paper it is written on.
3,"Ok, but not great!","Pretty much every technique mentioned in the book can be found on the Internet. The surfacing examples are good but otherwise it is just another book to add to your ""Bill Flemming"" collection of so-so books.Jim"
2,Out of Date and Difficult to Use,"When I ordered E.A. Wallis Budge's dictionary, I knew it would be out of date. But I was also told that, like Alan Gardiner's ""Egyptian Grammar"", it was a must- have for any Egyptian library. This is not so. Many of the translations are inaccurate, the book is very expensive, and one cannot look up English words to find their translations. Instead, one must first look up the Egyptian word to find the hieroglyphic translation. In addition, when I ordered the book, it came with only one volume of the two, so I now have only 'a- kha' listings without an index. I was disappointed to find so many errors and I was unable to look up any words quickly. This book is only for experts who know where mistakes have been made, and want to take the time to correct them.Note- The second volume is available at Amazon, and probably has an English index. However, I would not reccommend spending over 100 dollars for an inaccurate, out-of-date dictionary."
1,"Garbage ""Science""","Quack Peter Manu gives ridiculous explanations and ""treatments"" for what he calls ""medically unexplained"" symptoms the only problem is that they are medically explained. For example there are approximately 4,000 articles in peer reviewed medical journals showing frank physical pathology (disease) in ME (aka CFS)."
5,Yankees Century,"a must for any sports fan. chronicles the most storied and succesful sports franchise in the world from begining to 2002, the year of this DVD's production."
2,The Yankees dont come up to scatch,"This is a poor production when compared to the Ken Burn's masterpiece ""Baseball"".Only for the deeply committed Yankee fans. It may be accurate but it isn't ""history"""
5,Great earrings,"I bought these earrings as a gift for a friend who had been looking for gold huggie earrings for a long time. She loves them, and says they are very comfortable."
3,"Cobbled Together, Disappointing","Any serious scholar who reads this book's introduction will get the feeling it was cobbled together from yet one more conference that didn't quite work out. Too wide-ranging to hold together theoretically, the piecemeal and somewhat simplistic analysis of the introductory chapter is disappointing. This is an important topic and one would have expected veteran Donald Moore to do better, even though it's an edited volume. A few of the individual chapters are interesting, although those authors have done better work elsewhere, such as Tania Li, Paul Gilroy, or Donna Haraway. The chapter which holds promise as covering some new ground is the one by Alcida Ramos, an innovative and synthetic thinker, although it too would benefit from more polish and finesse. The whole volume has a hasty feeling to it and is ultimately a disappointment."
3,Can't close with one hand,This stroller is excellent in the hood to shield the sun and it seems solid and comfortable but I have a large stroller and wanted this to travel with. It requires 2 hands to close the carriage which leaves no hands to hold the baby when getting in a cab.
4,Great...but too small for my baby,"I researched for the perfect stroller and decided the Savvy Soho was it. I tested it out and it handled well. It's super light and takes up little space. When I got it home, the ""only"" problem I found was that my 3 month old was too big for it. He's 18 pounds and 29 inches long. Granted, I have a big boy, but this stroller should be able to accomodate that. I recommend bringing your child with you when you try out strollers.Maria, Oceanside, CA."
4,what a difference,"I was looking for a smaller stroller that was easier to travel with b/c our regular one took too much space in the car. I didn't like umbrella strollers b/c there was nothing to them. I love this stroller b/c it's small and lightweight, yet is very supportive of my 13 month old. The cushioning on the sides is great for when he falls asleep. He likes it better b/c he has a better view of everything. The canopy is good sized for being a small stroller, I do wish it could have been bigger though. The only drawbacks are the small basket underneath and no cup holders. Other than that it is an awesome stroller especially when traveling. You can zip around easily with one hand and the strap makes it easy to carry. I highly recommend this stroller if you are looking for an alternative to an umbrella stroller."
3,"stroller ok, no bells and whistles","I bought this for my daughter who is now about 4 months old. She is a pretty big baby, and I have a hard time picturing a child weighing 40 pounds or so using this, even though that's what the weight limit is.I like the ease of folding the stroller, and it is very lightweight. Comes with a carrying strap and a carrying bag. However, the basket is so small it's almost useless, and it is hard to get to - even when the seat is not reclined. If the seat is reclined, sometimes my legs hit the seat as I walk. Also, (and I know this is petty) I really wish it had a cup holder.If you are looking for something to keep in your trunk for short trips, this would be great! For me, think we need something a little bigger."
2,Cute but don't buy if you plan to steer,"I have had this for 1 year and finally just bought a Peg-Perego OH (One Hand). My Combi was impossible to steer and I was constantly running into things in stores. The basket is awfully small and impossible to use. There is a bar across the only area to put something into the basket. Once you finally get something into it, it will drag on the wheels- terrrible design, you think they would try some of these things out before they produced it. I would recommend a Maclaren or Peg-Perego- they have the same features, but you can steer them and use the baskets."
1,Seemed good but broke down less than 2 years later,"And the customer service was horrendous. First she hung up on us and then wouldn't let me know who her manager was or forward me to anyone else. Also then we wrote a letter to Combi which was ignored.We were happy with the stroller up till the front swivel wheels automatically locked, when using, instead of only locking when manually pressed. This meant that the stroller couldn't turn and was a hazzard. I also forwarded to CSPC but am still waiting for any response. Consider the lack of customer service before you purchase any Combi item."
3,not so great,"We bought this stroller the night before a big trip. My Pliko was in the shop and my 25 lb. six month old was not comfortable in a regular umbrella stroller. I was excited about how compactly the combi folded but it did not hold up to the vacation test. First of all it is way to short for my 6-2 husband. He kicked the wheels and killed his back all week. The stroller is too lightweight and looks like it will crack under the girth of my huge kid. He looks like he is wedged in the stroller and does not seem very comfortable. The stroller does not steer well either. I talked with some petite families who loved the stroller for traveling but it is not made for the big and bulky. I plan to return the stroller and get something else that fits my baby and my husband better. If you and your child are petite - this is a very compact, lightweight stroller that will be easy to pack and check on the airplane."
1,Do not buy this stroller,"what junk...I can't believe i bought it! horrible wheels, basket, and cover...this is the worst stroller ever....Don't make the same mistake I did."
1,THE WORST STROLLER! I HATE IT!,"I purchased this stroller for a trip and to keep in my vehicle instead of our full size. It is the worst stroller I could have spent this much money on. You cannot steer it with one hand, it handles horribly and its already starting to break (the plastic handles). I broke down and bought a maclaren triumph and love it. I found it on at an popular online auction website for the same price as I paid for this combi!!! Don't waste your money and patience on this piece of junk."
3,Not for anyone over 5 ft 6 in. tall!,"I purchased this stroller because of the great reviews. I liked almost everything about it except there was one major problem - it's not for anyone over 5'6"". I am 5'8"" and my husband is 6'1"" and we could not walk with the stroller without hitting our feet on the bottom. It was EXTREMELY uncomfortable. We purchased handle extensions, which didn't fit, so they didn't help. If Combi made handle extensions or made adjustable handles, it would be a great stroller. Instead, we purchased a Graco Metrolite stroller. It is 6 lbs heavier, but has adjustable handles. Also, the basket is quite small on the Combi stroller and does not fit even a decent sized diaper bag."
3,"Caution is you're 5'7"" or taller...","I am 5'7"" and when I walk my daughter my feet hit the wheels. The arm handle does not adjust. My husband, who is 6'1"", can't comfortably stroll her at all.If you are planning on walking slowly, strolling through the mall, it is great. It turns on a dime and can get anywhere."
1,Not exactly what I was looking for!,"The Freeloaders is a kind of a cheap crime novel about five Americans in Nice, France. The reading is not easy for someone who is not native English speaker. Actually, I hardly managed to reach half of it, when I quit. Maybe somebody else would find it interesting, but this is not me.I was looking for a nice book about ""freeloaders"" and to learn something from it, but it was not exactly what I was looking for. Nothing interesting from my viewpoint."
1,Wish I had one,This product apparently cannot be shipped. It arrived in pieces. The replacement also arrived in pieces. I gave up after two.
4,Good Hits collection...,"But I have ""POP!-20 Hits"" already and think that was a better representation of why Erasure was so great. Btw, with this new collection having 3 covers of ABBA songs, why doesn't it have their great cover of Blondie's ""Heart of Glass""?So anyway, should you buy this or POP!? I have the solution: backtrack and buy all their cd's in order and experience Erasure to its fullest. Most of their cd's have too many wonderful undiscovered/unheard gems in them."
4,More Hits!,"I love Erasure, one of my favorite groups. But no 5 stars here because I could not believe some of the omissions on this album. Only one song from I Say I Say I Say, Cowboy, & Other People's Songs. Where is ""Don't Say Your Love is Killing Me""?I think they should have went all the way and truly included their ""hits"" on this album. I would have gladly paid the price to have all the songs. The DVD is excellent however....all the songs in video form, plus extras. I was hoping with this album that I would not have to carry around 10 erasure CD's in my car and it would all be on one. That is not the case though. They need to re-release ""Hits"" with a special 3 disc set (all the songs plus that remix) and let all of us fans have all the songs we truly love and adore by this great group!"
5,Erasure's Best of CD,"For those erasure fans out there that probably know that this is the second greatest hits that they have. It has a lot of there hits but obviously you cannot put every hit on a cd. It is a good selection of songs except that they should not have added 2 versions of O'lamour and could of put another song in it's place. Some of the songs that could have been added and are missing is: star, come and make me smile, Don't say your love is killing me, and drama. The bonus CD of the mixes of the songs was very good. Overall it is a CD that I recommend not only to the erasure fan but anyone that likes good pop music."
2,a disappointment,"i have listened erasure for a long long time and this is a really really disappointing release. def. a marketing gag instead of anything that has more to offer to die hard fans like me. you only get a couple of ""new"" tracks over pop:first20 and the bonus megamix is abysmal. uninspiring and really awkwardly done. is this release supposed to scare the old and new fans away? incomplete collection of singles: BAD IDEA!!!!! using mark town's (who?? exactly!!!) megamix: BAD IDEA!!!!! it is sloppy and looks like a quick buck product from what is normally a great label: mute. will go down badly in fandom history and begs the elusive question: what where you thinking?!????? if you see a copy and don't have pop:first20, you might want to grab a copy if you want a retrospective compilation. get it on sale and avoid the megamix at all costs!!!"
1,And the purpose?,"While Erasure's a handful good songs are already collected in Pop Hits then what's the purpose of this money-steal item? Erasure have never been a high quality band but is rather doomed to be poor man's Pet Shop Boys with those awful lyrics and the same loops and rhythms all over the years. If you really wanna try Erasure go buy Pop and leave it there. If you really want to listen real good pop music, try Pet Shop Boys (Popart or any album of them) the overlooked gods of this kind of music, or New Order..."
2,Great though not as good as it could have been.,"Don't get me wrong,this is a great selection of Erasure hits.The problem is these were mostly on the ""Pop 20 hits disc"".This new collection ignores two of Erasure's greatest discs ""Cowboy and the self titled Erasure disc"".These are a must have for anydance music fan.The ""best of""only includes two songs off these discs.This just gives you a couple of new songs on the end of a 20 Hits disc.What should have been released is a singles disc,including ""Rain"",""Worlds on Fire"",""Don't say your love is killing me"",and ""Fingers and Thumbs"".Instead we get this disapointing rehash.-Ant"
3,Just buy the DVD,"While most of this collection is a revisit of the old ""Pop"" disc, I decided to buy the DVD version and was glad that I did! Always known for their innovative, and sometimes campy, videos I had to get it. All of the hits are there, including many from the past decade. There are so many videos, that they put them on 2 disks! A great buy and a necessity for any fan. I say, skip the CD and get the DVD instead!"
5,U-700,It is s great book and I have now purchased over twelve of James Follett's book. I already have all ofKen Follett's books. I recommend everyone comsider James Follett in the same light as Ken.
3,"Very enjoyable DVD, bad format","This DVD (despite it's reference on the cover as a theatrical release in 1974) is actually 4 episodes from the series sandwiched together (including the two parter that actually were the last 2 episodes of the series). I would rather see all the episodes in proper order. By the way, 1 clip from another 2 parter also appears in this disc. This is the dumbest mistake as there is no reference to the particular character. One who hasn't seen the series in 1966 on ABC or the reruns on FX in 1994 would think the Green Hornet just diverted to knock another bad guy down, just for the sake of it, while en route to the real crime. Buy the DVD and it's pending sequel to preserve the series, yes, but know what you're getting first. By the way to the person who quoted the opening above, that opening was done by William Dozier NOT Gary Owens (doesn't anybody watch Batman anymore?)"
3,The Green Hornet exists!!,"Despite what other reviewers may think, the original 26 episodes of The Green Hornet are still in syndication by 20th Century Fox Television. In recent years the series has run in the USA (on the ACTION Channel), Australia (Fx Channel) and in the UK (Bravo Channel).Fox seem reluctant to release their old TV shows on DVD. Why?? Who knows??"
2,This dvd stinks,I have to agree with eric and anyone else who thought this was lousy made as this dvd had three episode in one and was very hard to follow So I did not like it and would not plan on buying the next issue unless you can prove that there is separate episode that goes all the way though.....
1,A Shadow of What It Rightfully Should Be...,"Did P.T. Barnum pioneer the idea of slapping together several random episodes (out of an ORIGINAL 28) of a once-excellent series, just for a few unsuspecting victims who might buy it? Usually POLITICS cancelled good series at the network level, NOT viewer popularity, or lack thereof; hasn't Star Trek haunted NBC long enough? The Green Hornet DID run a full season; there WERE re-runs back then, too. While I like and respect Bruce Lee, watching too many of his movies becomes like being stuck in a revolving door; they start to look too much alike. This was NEVER the case with Green Hornet episodes. I am blessed with the bootleg versions-all 30, including the two 'crossover' ones with Batman. The Black Beauty and Batmobile in each of two shows together? WHAT MORE CAN YOU ASK?!?! Sadly, that's certainly NOT what you're getting here..."
2,This actually WAS a theatrical release - too bad it's cut up,"This was released as a theatrical release to cash in on Bruce Lee's death. I actually saw it at an old drive-in that no longer exists in East Rutherford, New Jersey. It's exactly as it was shown it the theater and was so butchered up that it was almost unwatchable. But with Van Williams, Bruce Lee, Wende Wagner and the rest of the cast, along with the high quality for a half-hour series from the sixties, it was worth it. The Action Channel still shows the Green Hornet (along with Time Tunnel and Combat) and I also truly wish they would release the episodes complete on DVD. But, until then, if you don't have the Action channel - this will have to do !!"
3,"TO Black Beauty (Lawrence, NY)","When I was a kid (yup, back in the 60's), I used to LOVE watching the Green Hornet series on t.v. - which didn't last very long.In re: to your wish to see 'those' series originals on dvd, I think you may never see that day. From what I understand, the ORIGINAL GREEN HORNET tv series 'film' archives were destroyed some time ago in a fire - hence, why you don't see the title on dvd. A real shame - especially for those of us fond of nostalgia . . . Think this may be as close as it's going to get for the GH"
3,Lack of digital audio inputs IS A BIG DEAL!!!!!,"Overall, I must say I am very pleased with the system for what it does. It really does sound great. However, I must take exception to the comments that the lack of digital audio inputs is not a problem. I beg to desagree. This is a medium end surrround sound system that ONLY plays 5.1 from it's own dvd player. What if you also have a satellite or cable HD package? How do you play that 5.1? Not with this SS system, because there is no digital audio inputs!!! Therefore, you cannot listen to the 5.1 SS from the satellite, or your dvd recorder. This is a real BUMMER. Now, I have to sell this one taking a huge loss of course, and buy another that DOES have digital audio inputs. BUMMER!!"
2,Sounded good...for about 30 seconds,"From the reviews I've read, this system sounded great - and for a great price as well. I did read the review right before this one about the 'F61' error...but of course I thought that was just an isolated case. How wrong I was.I connected my system and speakers exactly as directed. After a bout 30 seconds of music, the receiver reads F61 and shuts off. I tried to adjust anything and everything. Nothing. It just reads F61 for 2 seconds and shuts off. Apparently F61 means there is afault in the power supply or something like that. It was pretty pathetic and there is no way I was about to spend money taking it to a dealer - its a BRAND NEW system. I immediately filed for a refund. Panasonic is also extremely unhelpful with this problem and just say to take it to an authorized repair center. Sereiously, what happened to supporting your products?"
1,Nothing but trouble,"If you're considering buying this Panasonic system, or any other Panasonic sound system for that matter, do a Web search for Panasonic error f61. You'll find many, many instances of people who have been victims of what is apparently a wide-spread problem with Panasonic products. My surround-sound system was only weeks old when the problem began with it shutting off and displaying this error message. I am STILL waiting for the company to resolve this. I will never buy another Panasonic product. This has been a complete waste of money."
1,"F61"" Power issues 1 month after purchase","I had my unit for 1 month before experiencing the ""F61"" many people have seen. I calling their repair shop back and forth during a period of 4 months and it seems that none of the parts that Panasonic sent them could fix the unit. To this date, I still can't get Panasonic to send me a refurbished unit. On top of that, I had to drive the unit 97 miles to the nearest repair shop. I would not recommend this product due to the terrible customer service when it comes to servicing the warranty."
1,Plagued with F61 Error,"System noisy out of box and very soon completely konked out with the famous Panasonic F61 error. Search for ""Panasonic F61"" in your web browser and that should be enough to convince you to never buy Panasonic audio equipment. I just wished I had done that before buying it..."
1,Receiver Broke After Four Months !!,"I bought this system four months ago. When I first got it, it was nice. It sounded good. Then just like everyone else here I got the error code and the receiver would shut off. It was still under warranty at the time. I took it to the nearest service center ""60 Miles"" and it took a month for them to call me back because the parts where on back order from Panasonic. So I went and picked it up got home and hooked it all back up. Plugged it in and what do you know it still had the same error code and would shut off. Still not fixed. A huge hassle and waste of Money/Time. Panasonic's customer care is horrid. They didn't help at all and where rude. So I ended up just having to buy a whole new system from another company."
4,Speakers worth more than price of whole system,Had this system for 3 years with no issues.Pros:- excellent speakers for the price- came with wireless so was able to hook up rear speakers to wireless station at back of room. Therefore no need to run wires across entrance ways etc.- 5 disk change changerCons:- 5.1 surround can only be used by the DVD player. Other devices can be input (e.g. DVR) but only with stereo inputs. Remote can replicate surround somewhat but it would be great if it had at least one HDMI input
1,Avoid at all costs!!!! F61 ERROR!!!!!!!!!,"Same problem as described above. Had the system 2 1/2 months and then the dreaded F61 and it was dead. Great while it worked, but it doesn't any longer."
1,Buyer Beware,"What a piece of JUNK! This was truly a waste of my hard earned money that I bought from Best Buy after I probably did not do enough research. The salesman at Best Buy said that it was a great middle of the road unit. However, it was my fault for not researching more thoroughly. It worked for 1 year and 3 months and then would not read any discs. Panasonic customer service sucks (""TAKE IT TO A SERVICE CENTER"" after being transferred and put on hold until I was ready to explode) and Best Buy said ""I told you so"" about the extended warranty, which I never get ""suckered"" in to. Well, woe is me! Anyway, my suggestion would be to stay away from this and any other Panasonic surround sound system due to all of the negatives and failures. I can say that I have a Panasonic TV (8 yrs. old), a Panasonic phone and a Panasonic camera that have all been carefree."
1,Panasonic repair service,"My nightmare Panasonic DVD recorder Md DMR EZ27, stopped operating after 5 months by not ejecting a DVD movie from Netflix, sent to Panasonic Camera & Digital Service Center, It took 9 weeks for the repair because they did not have the part, could not order Netflix movies until DVD was returned, after phone calls and notifying Panasonic, an employee lied about a phone conversation regarding the repair stating ""your husband get mad and hung up"" and ""the part is coming in next week"" How does a company like Panasonic not have the part for a 5 month old product? Even customer service at Panasonic was of no help. I will not buy their products as long as I live!"
3,"cuts aluminum, but not as well as you'd think","I bought the Metal-Cutting XBit to freehand cutting in 0.125"" sheet aluminum and found it workable, but barely. The bit could not penetrate the plate to start a cut in the middle of the sheet, requring me to start every cut with a power drill instead. After less than an inch of travel, the bit was clogged with melted aluminum chips. After cleaning the bit with an icepick, I sprayed the surface of the aluminum with WD-40 for cooling and lubrication. By spraying the work area regularly, I was able avoid clogging the bit for several hours of subsequent use."
3,Hard to guide,Hard to guide with a large kerf. . I got a much better cut with my jigsaw and a new blade
2,NOT CARBIDE!,"The Rotozip website specifies that this bit is made of high-speed steel, not carbide! I called Rotozip and they verified that it is indeed high-speed steel.Amazon should correct the advertising."
2,easy broken,"i am very with this brand ! i am very Dispointed cause brake easily,i am Not recommend for metal cutter"
3,Not easy to install,"I bought this module for my honda car, after reading that its easy to install. But when I bought it I found out it was difficult to install. In fact I ended up paying a car mechanic to install it."
3,Bulldog RS102 Remote Car Starter with Keyless Entry,"I have found this product to be great. However, I have had recent difficulties in the run time of my truck. It is supposed to run for fifteen minutes however, it only runs for approx. 5. I have had it for three years. The problem just recently started. Other than that I found it to be wonderful. If the Bulldog Company would help me with this problem, I would be very thankful.Thank you"
5,Follow the Directions..,"For the people who said they had to take there remote starter to a mechnic to have it installed, get a life. All you gotta do is splice in about 12 wires or so drill 1 or maybe 2 holes and mount the box. You people must have never even touched a screwdriver before if you cant hook this thing up. Granted the 1st time it may take 4-6hrs but after that an hour or two. And by the way remote starters WILL NOT burn your starter out if it is hooked up PROPERLY. It's no different than using the key to turn your vehicle on. If your starter is grinding than you hooked it up wrong."
4,Great dryer sheet,"Although I love liquid fabric softener on towels, these Snuggle Fabric Softener Sheets are wonderful for everything else. I love the Orange rush scent."
5,starscream,i got this with my brothers help he kept vectorprime and i kept starscream starscream is really cool because if you get the supreme he's kindof hard to play with the others normally cause he's so BIG! but this deluxe version is very fun to play with the others because he's almost exactly like the big one but smaller and it's really fun to play with them both if you like starscream like me all in all an A+ toy
4,Just Hot,Only thing I can say about this cd is that its HOT. and it saddens me because its such a good CD and Adinas not getting the attention she deserves.
4,neat little model,"I like engine models, this one is decent not the best but for the price its ok. Wish it was a little bigger, maybe double the size but ofcourse that would cost more lol."
5,Very nice model,"Very high quality pieces. Nice fit and finish. Great intro to an engine for my boy. I posted a pic in the gallery of our work in progress, and you can see the detail of the carbs, etc.Very much worth the money and effort."
3,review,"Took my 10 yr old about an hour to assemble. Thought it may be more interactive, ie show how pistons worked etc."
4,Information,This book has alot of information...it is a little tough to decypher at times. For me I would like to see it more user friendly.
3,Love Hate Relationships,I bought two of these binoculars but only one was good. The images on the second were not in line with each other.
3,"I was going to rate this three and a half, but there is no three and a half.","This is a good book. I probably liked it a lot because I love RPGs.The first bad thing about this book was that the characters always argued. They were always sarcastic or snapping at each other.The other bad thing is that the book dragged a bit. Not a lot, just a bit."
3,Blah!,"okay, it's possible I missed something, seeing as I don't play RPG's, but I thought this book had some serious flaws in it! The characters were shallow and unpleasent (always bickering amongst themselves),shallow, unpleasent, and did I mention shallow? I have no sympathy whatsoever for any of them. As soon as I finished reading it, I stuck the book back on my shelf and it will probably stay there and gather dust for years."
5,User Unfriendly...Friendly?,"There is only one word for how good this book was...amazing. Possibly because I am a huge role-playing game (RPG) fan and this book illustrated the life inside of an RPG. The story was portrayed magnificently and the details sounded realistic in comparison to common RPGs in the world today, although much more interesting since it was like being inside of the game instead of just playing it."
1,Does not work for Motorola V170,"I saw the other review that said it didn't work for V173, but I bought this anyway for my V170. It also doesn't work for V170. Why Amazon is advertising and selling this product as a Motorola V170 charger is beyond me. I guess sometimes the products are mislabeled."
3,Nice Looking...and not completely practical--Prone to band problems!,"UPDATE 9/20/07You will need a watch screwdriver! The band is attached with screws...they work out with wear.AVOID!!!!As others have commented, this is a very nice looking, thin watch with a very broad leather band.The face is readable only with considerable ambient light. It is difficult to read in night street lighting, for example.The date button is recessed and very difficult to engage without pushing a finger nail into it.Note that the information from Amazon is incorrect. This watch does not have a Japanese movement. The watch and band are from China.Adequate...best to wear to make a fashion statement."
1,"the watch stops working, but comes back when u push a button..","same problem as 1 star rater harry... it does look cool, but every now and then the watch stops working and nothing appears on the display. i have to push the date button to bring it back and have to reset the time again and again. HOWEVER, MY problem started pretty soon, about 2 weeks (not 5 weeks like harry..) after i got the watch."
5,nice watch,"Love it, very elegant watch. I like very much the vertical way it gives time; the only inconvenient it's that is really hard to see without light, but it looks so good i dont care!"
3,"Superb design, mediocre quality","As with all Kenneth Cole watches I purchased so far, this goes for this one, too. The design, Danish-like and the exterior finish are typical for Kenneth Cole watches. Most inconvenient things are not having the option the put the watch in 24h (European) mode, and the accuracy of the watch (2-minute deviation per fortnignt)."
2,"Stopped working within 5 weeks, Specktone impossible to reach","I purchased this item after seeing it highlighted in ReadyMade magazine. Unfortunately it stopped working just outside of the seller's return policy so I reached out to the manufacturer, Specktone, for replacement. I've sent 3 emails, left 2 voice messages and received a barrage of ""this mailbox is full"" greetings while calling their headquarters. I'm afraid, while the unit's styling is great and while it worked it sounded good, it's not something I can recommend based upon the poor customer service offered."
4,An Excellent Series,"Bloesch's Christian Foundations is an excellent series (4 out a projected 7 published thus far), based on a ""progressive evangelical"" approach. He relies a lot on Barth & Brunner, which will stick in some evangelical's craw. This book is my favorite since it does an excellent job in taking rationalists like Clark, Van Til, Geisler, etc. to task from a Calvinist perspective."
3,Walnuts are good but the price... not so much.,"Is this price correct? $46.34 works out at over $7 a lb! I am sorry, but for this price I would not buy from this supplier. This is just a ridiculous price. Walnuts can be purchased ANYWHERE for less than $5. per lb."
5,Walnuts are delicious and good for you,"I love these chopped walnuts. I put them in cereal, chicken salad and sweet potato casserole, to name a few. They are good for you, also."
4,"these walnuts are fresh and are chopped to the perfect size for topping ice cream and yogurt, etc.","I enjoyed these chopped walnuts very much. They are fresh and crunchy and are perfect for use in trail mix or as a topping for ice cream, yogurt, etc.I like the small eight oz. bag. It's a very convenient size that doesn't leave me wondering how to keep a whole pound of nuts fresh if I have to open the bag just to use a few walnuts on my granola in the morning.However, for some uses (i.e. making chunky chocolate chip cookies), I have found that the shelled walnuts work much better for me than these chopped walnuts do. The small pieces (chopped walnuts are really just walnut crumbs) seem to blend more into the background of baked goods than the big shelled walnut chunks do.For that reason, I prefer the Diamond shelled walnuts to their chopped walnuts. However, both products are very good."
5,"Diamnond Walnuts, Chopped, 8 Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)",I eat a handful of these walnuts daily for Omega 3 fatty acids with a diet coke as a great snack. I eat 1 bag per week. They taste great & they always have tasted fresh. I empty 1 bag of walnuts in a plastic storeage container & either keep it in the fridge or in a kitchen cabinet. I am about to order subscribe & save to save 6.00 on my next order. I am sure that they would be great for baking as they are nicely chopped.
3,SHOCKING,"The story has its psychological pull; what would happen if you could channel rage in some physical way (in this case, ""create"" children, or extensions of yourself, to handle it all for you)? Cronenberg, never subtle, builds to one of the most sickening moments ever put on film. I saw this on TV about 15 years ago, and have never been able to erase the memory of that scene from my mind - and I love horror films. Oliver Reed and Samantha Eggar both bring a gravity and seriousness to the movie that makes it even more terrifying. There is a pulpy, classic quality to this movie, and it's nice to see it on DVD."
2,A hugh miss with David Cronenberg,"I collect David Cronenberg films. I especially like his style and subject matter he chooses to put on film. With that said, I purchased this DVD w/o initially seeing the movie. I did not like the movie feeling it had poor production values , poorly written and acted. I can not recommend it with a positive feeling."
3,KILLER RAGE,"This is one of David Cronenberg's most unusual--and personal---movies. Inspired by his own messy divorce, THE BROOD is an examination of rage and how taken to its extremes can be quite bloody.Oscar nominee Samantha Eggar (THE COLLECTOR) plays a woman who is undergoing controversial therapy at a clinic run by the late Oliver Reed. Her husband (Art Hindle) is concerned that his wife is abusing their five year old daughter and threatens to keep her away. Pretty soon all the people who have threatened Eggar's existence are being offed by strange dwarf-like children..where did they come from?Cronenberg keeps the tension high and there's lots of bloody murders. It's a strange film but encompasses Cronenberg's unusual cinematic style."
5,Pick it up!,Great movie. Had never heard of it until I recently saw it at my DVD store. Seeing who was the director peaked my interested and I'm very happy I picked it up. Very underated horror movie from a really good director.
3,Not the Fly but good,"I am a Cronenberg fan. I love his early work. I do believe that this film is a step up from Rabid, but not as good as the follow up Scanners. Cronenberg made some challenging and intriguing films. I believe hsi remake of the Fly(1986) was the best horro film of the 80's, close behind Carpenters the Thing. This film is a little slow at times and the story is ridiculous, however, the locations and characters are interesting and scary."
3,HOLDS ME IN!,"I like the way it hold me in, but I don't like the fact that the cups make my boobs look like they are pointing at people. I probably won't purchase this again."
4,Not for everyone.,"This bra arrived very promptly. I wear long line bras because I have a hernia. The long line holds in the hernia effectively. It also helps my posture. This bra makes me appear too ""pointy"", however, so I can only wear it with my scrub tops, with other layers of clothing under the scrub. The size is correct. This is not a modern style bra. I suggest layers be worn over it unless a ""pointy"" look is what the wearer is trying to achieve."
2,Why would anyone torture themselves??,"Well, I was trying to find a bra that would also help my posture. This is NOT the bra. I tried three different sizes, and all were too large in the cups and too tight in the waist. I do not know why any woman would want to torture themselves with this product. We are not living in the dark ages anymore."
1,Exquisite Form. NOT!,"I do not like the shape of the cups on this bra, and it's difficult to fasten the many hooks (some are already bent). I wouldn't recommend this bra to anyone."
2,Not what I expected,"I have a problem with bras cutting into my sides so I thought I would try a longline bra. When I recieved this one, it seemed to be made of cheap material and seemed to be made for an older woman. Also, the size around was too small but the cup size was fine. So, if you must order this bra you better order one size larger around."
4,Longline Bra,"I like it, but it was shorter in length than I expected. For comfort and good fit I need a longer one."
5,Right product,I ordered this for my mother. It is what see has been looking for for several years. However since she has lost a lot of weight recently we had to return for another size. Return was trouble free.
2,Usable but awkward,"The good:I got this as a gime. Defanetely the price was right ($0)Small size is handy.The bad:The mechanism for holding the iron is awkward and had to adjust.The Iron was not sharp and dulls easily.The ugly:QC doesn't appear to be a priority and the sole is not totally flat (about 1/4"" at the rear slopes up)."
4,A Credible Image of Shanghai,"I want to first explain some special Chinese terms to Western readers:Lifu: formal suit; Gongchang: factory; Extra Kuai: extra income (kuai is the colloquil term of dollars)I think it is one of the masterpieces about Shanghai I have ever seen. When I read it, I just curious about how the authors knew so much about Shanghai in the past, and I believe it is not from their imagination, but from their hard information collection, profound life experience and marvellous writing techniques. That is why we can enjoy the vivid images of Shanghai that we did not see."
2,Do NOT Buy This Model for Stargazing!,"Trying to use this scope with the included table stand will only frustrate you. Trust me on this. Pay the extra $50 and get the model that includes the 884 Tripod. If you don't, you'll soon be buying the tripod separately, and that will run you another $200."
4,Great scope -with a couple of qualifications...,"I own an ETX-90 (original non-electronic ver) and am delighted with the optical and mechanical design. Unfortunately, I remain a little concerned about Meade's quality control as the secondary mirror fell off inside my scope when it was a few months old, and a friend says his secondary baffle came loose. Still, if you don't get a flawed unit the optics are a terrific value and the Super Plössl 26mm eyepiece included is very good, as well.x"
3,"cool, but really need optional eyepieces!","The ETX-90EC has magnification of 48X; great for looking at the moon. However, if you want to look at any planets or stars, you _definitely_ need the optional eyepieces so you can have some control over magnification. Without these optional eyepieces, you have no control over magnification."
2,"Small Aperture, High price","Ok, sure the telescope will find the target automatically, but because of its small objective lens diameter your view of deep space objects is severely limited. I advise spending those 600+ dollars on an 8-inch Orion Skyquest dobsonian or a 10-inch Mead dobsonian, you'll have to learn your way around the skys but, its a far more rewarding experience and the images are much better."
1,Failed to do the job.,"I couldn't make this tool work to remove one way screws on my burglar bars. Nor could the pro window installer who tried-even using an impact hammer! If I hadn't destroyed the package, I would have sent it back!"
4,Suitable,"The belt is great, but the sizes are misleading. I the belt needs to be ordered one size larger then needed. The buckle is also great because it is changeable, you are put in a new belt buckle which is more suitable with the belt."
5,Audiophile Sound + Powerful Built-In Amp,"I've owned several different cassette walkmans over the years, including some vintage units from Panasonic until I stumbled upon this unit.Best feature for me is that this unit features a powerful built-in amplifier. This walkman can easily power my Sennheiser HD-650's and or AKG 701's with relative ease; that is, you don't have to use a portable headphone amplifier.It plays Metal and CR as well as normal tapes and provides a portable as well as inexpensive means to enjoy vinyl LP music on the go.Built-in bass boost features are another plus as you can set to bass to your tastes.The continuous waveform recording analog tape provides is still superior to compressed digital. Analog rules!"
3,Sony Sports Walkman:,"I was disappointed in the location of the battery replacement box, which is located inside. It took some effort to remove the lid in order to insert batteries. Also there is no battery light to determine when the batteries are dying. There is no window to view which way the tape is moving inside the walkman. This would be helpful when fast forwarding to know which direction it's running. Aside from all these complaints it seems to be working just fine."
2,A real clunker,"Don't be fooled by the word ""Sports"" in the name. This is an unwieldy item not suitable for use during running or walking. I was particularly disappointed because my last Sony Sports model was small, lightwieght, and survived my less than gentle handling for 5 years. Too bad they broke the mold."
1,I'm returning mine!,This unit is awful. It is heavy and the aluminum piece flops out uncontrolably (it doesn't stay latched down). This is not like some of the models you may have seen in the stores. Do not waste your money on this walkman!
5,Unbeatable Price Works Great,"Simple component that seems to fit a number of Toyota vehicles. I used this on a 1976 Toyota pickup. It doesn't look the same as what came off, but it reaches the correct throw. Easy to install. I used a pressurized bleeder, but the old pump and bleed system will serve just as well. Price-wise, I don't see how this could be beat, and delivery was under five days including the weekend."
2,Inconsistent Product,"You get what you pay for I guess. This product gave me very inconsistent readings on lots of batteries, both used and brand new. I'd test it once, and it would say 1/2 empty and then a few minutes later the same battery would say full. I just sent it back to get a refund. I'm considering getting the Mini-Multi Battery Tester instead."
1,Save You Money,"I purchased the Tekton because it advertises that it will check a battery under a load. I found that this 9 dollar unit is no better than the 2 dollar one. I have a nose hair trimmer and according to the Tekton the AA battery is good (green) but the blade barely moves. If I replace the battery with a fresh one, well it's night and day. Don't waste your money, buy the cheaper one. It does the same job."
3,"Okay, but could be better","First, be aware that you'll have to supply a 9-volt battery to be able to test fuses and lamps. Next, the sliding contact is not spring-loaded, and you wind up wishing you had a third hand to check batteries: one to hold the tester, one for the battery, and one to slide the movable contact in.That being said, it actually does a decent job testing batteries, fuses and lamps. The meter seems to be reasonably accurate, and the unit itself is fairly solid. Now, if they would just put a spring on that pesky slider..."
3,Works Ok A Bit Disappointed,This is my first review. I read reviews religiously before buying and I thought it was time I shared my experience. We tried to test a D size battery and the D battery would not fit in the tester. The bottom piece does not go down far enough so you cannot test it.I also find it a bit difficult to hold the battery in while checking to see if it is still good. It is ok but I am disappointed I cannot check the larger size batteries
2,Not that good,"1.The product I received did not look like the one in the picture.2.You cannot test Button Cell Batteries. The moving arm does not fully close and it leaves a gap of half an inch. I do not know about you but my button cell batteries are smaller than half an inch.3.Testing the light Bulbs was not that easy.4.I could not figure out how to check ""Battery Capacity Under Simulated Load Conditions"". Maybe this was on the model that I paid for but not received?Everything else worked fine but you can get that for $1 instead of spending $10 for this one.I returned it."
2,Seems to be inaccurate,"I was looking forward to having a multi-purpose tester. I kind of liked the idea of being able to test lightbulbs too, because we have a few around that I don't know about and wanted to sort and either keep or recycle.In the end, I couldn't get an accurate result on the batteries I tested, and I couldn't even determine how to test lightbulbs. There were no real instructions for it, and every way I held the lightbulb to it got kind of a wonky result. Some of the batteries I tested were known duds, already used up, but the tester was showing them at full charge.Definitely not a very accurate tester, which is disappointing. I don't know if I just got a defective unit, or what... but the unit did match the picture on the product description, so it wasn't just the ""wrong one"". I had to return it."
4,Great little meter for the money!,"Great little meter for the money but still can't figure out how to test button batteries which it says it will do. If that is what you want to test, then this is not the meter for you but otherwise it is easy to use and a great price."
4,"Good, but brief, booklet on Yosemite Miwok","This is an interesting booklet on the Southern Yosemite Miwok who inhabited Yosemite Valley and the surrounding region. It was written to go with the recreated Miwok village behind the Yosemite Visitor Center.The interesting part is the text is in Miwok and English.The previous reviewer apparently has an ax to grind. True, in the 20th century the Miwok intermarried Piute, and Piute spouses moved into Yosemite Valley, but this booklet covers the life before the disasterous contact with European man in the mid-1800s."
3,"Not rugged enough, but pretty cool while it lasts.","After 3 years of daily use in my pickup truck, my unit occasionally refuses to eject a CD and requires some smacking around. The motor that extends and retracts the button panel tends to get stuck midway. In reality the smooth face is not a theft deterrent."
2,"Les Miserables, Edinburgh style","The Debt Collector is another British crime film that doesn't add up to much. A Scottish variation on Les Miserables, it sees Ken Stott's typically bitterly furious cop stalking reformed debt collector turned artist Billy Connolly on the mean streets and leafy suburbs of Edinburgh, here shot in such oppressive and dark tones that it looks more like a Victorian prison than a holiday destination. Iain Robertson offers strong support as a hero-worshipping little gobs**te, but by the time the inevitable confrontation takes place without any great revelation you find yourself wondering if this journey was really necessary."
2,Not for those who don't study well alone,"After reading all the reviews, I purchased this thinking I had found a great study resource. I was very disappointed at how little information it contained. It has a basis for the GRE but oftentimes takes your knowledge for granted and doesn't completely explain answers to the problems in simple enough terms. If you did great in math without teacher assistance you'll have no problem with the book. However, if you have ever required a math tutor you will not find this all that helpful. Not to mention, the book leaves a lot out that you'll need to practice. Verbal wise, it's okay. It gives long lists of words and practice exams for you to do but again you really need to be a self motivator as the book is not at all interesting. I didn't find anything special about the CD rom. It is average, just like you'll find with any GRE study workbook."
3,Decent Book-CD ROM not for MACS,"This is a decent GRE prep book, BUT be advised. Contrary to what you might think for from the description, the CD-ROM is Windows ONLY. IT DOES NOT WORK ON MACS. There is an 800 number to call to get the MAC CD-ROM, but I add a terrible time getting through and then it never showed up.So, my advise is: if you have a MAC and want a CD-ROM, don't buy this book."
4,buy this book just for the CD,the book is a good revview for what you need on the GRE but I prefer the GRE for Dummies especially if you where away from study and school for many years just like me. The best thing is the CD it is terrific although it is a little bit complicated but when you become familiar how to use it you get an excellent tool to raise your grades on the GRE.
4,Useless CD-ROM,"I purchased the book and cd-rom combo in order to take advantage of the authentic computer-adaptive tests (CATs) available with the cd-rom. Nothing in the book or on this website indicated the need for a WAV soundcard in order to use the cd-rom. The Kaplan customer service center didn't seem too terribly concerned that I spent [money] for something completely useless to me or that their list of computer capability requirements was flawed. Bottom line, the book is really helpful, but don't waste your money on the CD-ROM if you don't have WAV capabilities."
5,"Great book, even better CD...","The software that comes with this book it great. In a weeks time I was scoring nearly 30% more on the practise tests I took. Their list of the top 100 words that appear on the GRE was really helpful too, quite a few of them popped up in my own test. By the time I was through with all the practise tests on the CD, th GRE did not seem that intimidating after all!"
1,Bad CD using old technology,I would have loved to have used the software on the CD but unfortunatly could never get it to work. I even had a second copy sent to me because I thought the first CD was bad. The problem is the CD uses an old version of Quicktime which is unfortunate. I am not about to take off a more recent version of Quicktime just to get this stuff to work. Even when I did take it off it did nothting but mess my system up. So I am sending this archaic software back to the company and will find something that is more up to date and doesn't rely on old versions of software to work. Sorry but I give this book a big one star and I would have gone lower if I could.
1,bad math review,"where the heck are the reviews for the data interpretation questions? There is none of it I could find in the book. Being able to do simple algebra and geometry should be the most basic skill required. I don't need any book that tells me how to add two numbers, but more drill on how to do the harder problems faster and how to approach graphs, charts and data with greater ease and comfort."
2,This book is a summary of Asa Drake's Crimson Kisses,"I am sure that ASA DRAKE author of Crimson Kisses and Warrior Witch of Hel is the another pen name for C Dean Anderson. This book is nearly identical to Asa Drakes Crimson Kisses plot wise and character wise. It is not as detailed and the dialog is not as fully fleshed but it is the same. Either it is completely plagerized or Asa Drake and C Dean Andersson are one in the same. As the ""Warrior Witch"" novels are similar I am going for the latter. If you want a hotter/darker book, read the original ""Crimson Kisses"" written in 1981 under the name Asa Drake."
2,Dracula made simple,"Vampire stories have intrigued and entertained me over many years. I greatly enjoyed Anne Rice,Michael Romkey, Bram Stoker, Laurell Hamilton and so many others.However, I am Dracula by Dean Andersson will not stay in my mermory very long, except to be on my not recommended list.The story retells the life and undeath of Vlad Dracul. I have read other authors who have accomplished this quite well. This author simply took the Bram Stoker premises, added Satan and the love of a life time without adding much depth to the characters.If you are looking for a quick read, this book will do just that. It can be read in a matter of hours."
5,"Artistic, simple, unpretentious","This is a beautiful and useful book, simplicity itself, that is written in a way that is as poetic, soulful, simple, and unpretentious as the cuisine it explores. The book instructed me not only how to prepare these dishes technically, but also how to appreciate their profound artistic and culinary value. As a great amateur of all things Middle-Eastern, this book is one of my most prized posessions."
4,moroccan cooking,"I prepared an entire Moroccan feast and enjoyed the ease of use with this cookbook. All ingredients are readily available at most supermarkets, and the combination of spices and their scents while cooking is beautiful. Simple, healthy and delicious recipes, along with colorful illustrations makes this a wonderful addition to my storehouse of cooking books. Highly recommended if you are adventurous in your cooking!"
5,Take a winter trip to Venice,"Much deeper than the typical travel memoir, Brodsky's recollections about his winter trips to Venice exposes much more than the charms of Venice. It provides insights into travel itself, and dare I say, human nature. The book is quite short, and reads more as a series of short stories tied together by the theme of Venice in winter."
3,i am going to be different,"It should have called ""Land where my MOTHERS Died"". I was hoping to read more about the fathers and what they went through. I found the story to long at some parts where I think it could have cut much shorter and still told the story. I wanted Jo Shelby to be more of a thinker and not so much relying on the women. I would have liked a more clearer ending. It was an ok read."
3,Scratchy fabric,"I suprisingly searched a long time in lots of stores for a 'kiss the chef' or 'kiss the cook' apron in black. The adjustable neck is nice, however, the fabric is very scratchy. Not impressed with the fabric at all."
3,Good for the money,"This is one of the better battery ran callous removers that I have found. It still lacks power. I believe at the only way to get anything better would be to get a professional one. This one at least works,which is more than I can say for the other callous removers that I have used that costed more."
1,Tiny little items with a not so tiny price,"Just wanted to say that these tiny little dots of sand paper with a tiny bit of sticky back are way too expensive to ever purchase again. Next time I will make my own out of my Husband's sanding papers. I would suggest others do the same. Buy the time you pay $5.49 for the 4 tiny discs and $5.25 for shipping, you could buy enough sanding paper to pay for this product several times over! The company could have put these things in a small envelope and paid the cost of a stamp to mail them out... What a waste of money! (Not complaining, just stated facts)."
2,Good Idea,Doesn't work as well as I would like. Have to use it a long time to get some results. Hardly use it now.
4,Feel good story!,"Really enjoyed this story. It's an easy read, hard to put down. The way the author writes about eating disorders and addictions is right on target. Very honest. It's a very satisfying read."
1,Amazon sent a used book rather than a new product.,"This order was for a gift and the product arrived with yellowed pages and black marker across the outside margin of all of the pages. This was OBVIOUSLY a used product and not a new book as advertised. Very, very disappointed in Amazon, not the product itself. Returned the item and Amazon did refund my money."
5,Great quick read in the Tending Roses Series,"The story of Julia and continuation in the life of Dell was a great read. Although sometimes predictable, the characters are so well developed you feel you know them personally. The challenges they face are common to many in todays society. It is refreshing to read novels that are uplifting. I have enjoyed every book in this series. Each novel stands alone, in fact I read the last not knowing there were others. I then went back to read all of the Tending Roses series. I wish Lisa Wingate would write another about Dell's life after she finds her father."
3,Don't buy it for the story by Sherrilyn Kenyon,"If you love the Dark-Hunter series, don't expect it here. Sherrilyn turned out a blah story that could have been churned out by anyone else. Her pen name was used just to get you to buy the book. The other stories aren't bad, probably since I had no expectations about their writing styles."
3,It Works but it didn't last....,"I like this radio and ours worked fine but only for one season.The battery backup never seem to work and after a few months it just didn't program anymore or work at all.I agree that the alerts are annoying at night for minor weather problems as other reviewers have pointed out.I wish that could be programmed so that you would only get alerts for Severe Storms, but you get the alert for everything and anything.I think everyone should have a weather alert radio....but I'm not sure this is the one.I am going to look at a few others this time around. Maybe upgrade to a better one."
5,Great Product,Easy to use - my first alert was with the recent approach of Hurricaine Noel to New England - high wind and flood warnings.Recently moved to a Mobile Home - the Weather Alert Radio is essential.
4,Weather radio review,"This is an excellent weather radio for the money. The only drawback is that the directions, or setup can be a little confusing. Other than that, my review would be five stars. It does the job it is intended to do after the set-up process.I strongly recommend it to protect yourself and your family!!"
1,"Worked perfectly for about 1.5 yrs., now just has a high pitched squeal.","This weather radio performed flawlessly for about 18 months, but then developed suddenly a high pitched squeal on all channels. If one does an internet search, many other buyers have eventually encountered this problem with a high pitched squeal developing after a year or two. I gave it a one star based on this, otherwise, it would have been a 5 star. Products should have a level of quality that they work for years."
3,Sleep???,"This was a fantastic gift that I received from my son on mother's day. Since we live in the country and cannot hear the tornado sirens I thought it was perfect--until I found out that the alert goes off for every hazard, flood watch, tornado watch, and all warnings. There isn't a way to program a specific hazard though. So every night I am awaken to flood watch or warning, thunderstorm watch or warning, when my only concern is a tornado warning. I would not recommend this item I am returning mine to upgrade to the Midland WR300 which can be programed to a specific hazard. Which will give me peace of mind but not wake me up every night."
1,Cheap & Dangerous,"Cheap, crapped out within 1 year! Dangerous as it malfunctioned during our current tornado season!Don't buy it! Made in China."
4,Midland wr100 Weather Radio,I gave this to my sister said she loves it. Very pleased just as described. The only reason i didn't give it a 5 was that it doesn't have a radio that you can listen to your station with..Overall very good..A must for everyone.
5,Good basic weather radio,"Good radio. I bought mine in the summer of 2009. Its been working good as new ever since. Uses battery power efficiently. Goes off for all warnings in your area to ensure your safety, doesn't go off for tests, which is good I guess."
5,Weather/Hazard radio,"I bought this item because we live in a hurricane prone area on the eastern shore of Maryland. I want to have all of the advance information on a weather threat as soon as possible, especially in the middle of the night when sleeping. Luckily, I haven't had an alert but feel much more at ease knowing I will be forwarned of any threatning weather."
1,Junk,The radio didn't work right out of the box. All I got was static. My other weather radio works great. I will buy another brand in the future
2,Great for a year and then it breaks...,"I would have rated this at a four because it use to work correctly. However after having only owned this product for about a year and a half the weather radio part has stopped working. With this being the main reason for purchasing the item I'm now rating it a 2 out 5. Now the only thing that happens when I turn the NOAA Weather radio on is a high pitched squeal on all channels. After consulting many reputable sources there is no fix (at least anything that is afordable). And to top it off, it breaks after the warrenty expires. Looks like I'll be buying another's wx radio."
2,unreliable,"I have the SAME code set for my county, but the alert only goes off about half the time. Also before you go to sleep you must determine if the weather is threatening enough to justify setting the audible alarm. I hate to woken up for every thunderstorm warning."
5,VERY SATISFIED,"Purchased this weather radio due to all the odd weather we've been having here in central New York. It has worked properly and was easy to set up. I feel very secure in the fact that it'll warn me, day or night, in the event of bad weather. To be sure I had some lead time, I set up two counties that normally get the bad weather before my county. (hope that makes sense)Amazon has always been prompt in sending out my purchases and have some of the best prices in town!! Purchased a Flip Video which I also love! But that's another review!!!!"
5,Midland WR100B Weather Radio,The radio alerts us when a new watch or warning comes even when asleep. With the recent weather it has been very good to have. The tv signal goes out but not this radio. With the battery back up it keeps us up to date.
3,Power supply failed,"The radio worked great, alerted us ervery time, but the power supply died and we got no email response from Midland. For the price I am ordering a new one."
4,Midland Weather Radio,"I was pleased with how easy it was to set up. I haven't had any alerts yet, so I don't know how well it works."
4,Great product,"The Midlands Weather Alert radio is easy to program, and has great features & controls. My only reason to give it only 4 stars is because the volume control is by preset notches, and I would like it to be 1 notch quieter. We turn it on to listen to the weather when we are going to sleep, and it is a little too loud for me.(but it might be ok for someone else) It is also much better than a more expensive model we got at Radio Shack which has only VERY LOUD volume, and is hard to program (some settings are impossible)."
5,Great Weather Radio,This is the best Weather Radio I've ever owned! Everything I want in one. Fast delivery. Good Price!
2,Radio Died on Me,"This radio worked fine for a few years, but now it only produces a high pitched tone on all weather channels. I've heard that many others have had the same problem with this radio. This is a big big problem, because I relied on it for tornado warnings. I would not recommend this radio, it's simply not reliable enough for it's intended use."
1,Junk,"We have had problem with this radio for a couple of years and contacted manufacturer's customer service and they were no help and wanted money to fix it. Did not have a good experience. This radio seems to be programmed to self destruct after two years and just has a one year warranty. Not a good quality product. This is the second one of these radio's that I had go bad, so would not recommend it."
1,"Bought in February, Trashed in June","I purchased the WR100 in February. Initially it worked. Within a couple of months it quit providing any weather warnings and about three weeks ago it quit receiving any signal. I have another weather radio that receives the local signal with no problem and it is at least 15 years old. So, I trashed the WR100. It is not worth the cost and effort to send it back to the manufacturer."
2,I've had 2 of these die now...,"I had one of these units for 3 or four years, and for whatever reason it stopped working (I think the power supply went out, but I'm not sure)... so I ordered another one in Oct of '11... it is now June '12 - and the second one has died... when I hit the weather/snooze button to hear the weather, all I get is a high pitched tone/squeal sound.I'm junking this one as well - I won't order another one."
2,Great Except For Fatal Flaw,"I purchased this model for my parents a year ago, and it worked perfectly for 14 months. Then, as the 2012 storms began to move in, they noticed the radio was silent. When they tried to tune in to the weather updates, the radio only produced a high-pitched squeal. They called me over to look at it, but I couldn't repair it. I did a little research, and discovered that this model has a reputation for lasting only 12-18 months. Apparently the audio chip in this model is prone to breaking. I recommend avoiding this model.I was very surprised to find out Midland had allowed a model they knew was defective to go into circulation. I have other Midland products and have never before had a problem with the Midland brand. I'll most likely buy my parents another Midland radio to replace this one--just a different model!"
1,One annoying storm season...,"...and then it died.Storm season here in Nebraska, is very busy for a weather radio. One storm system can bring dozens of alerts to a county. After being woken for countless watches, flood warnings, and other alerts of no consequence to me, I quickly realized that the ability to choose alerts is invaluable. Basically, the Midland WR100 cannot do that. After purchasing the much superior Sangean CL-100, the Midland was exiled to the basement, to bother us no more.Soon after, I noticed that the Sangean was alerting to warnings, while the Midland was silent. After some testing, it was determined that the Midland had quit altogether. It could not receive weather broadcasts, much less alert.To summerize, thirty bucks bought me one Spring of interrupted sleep, and little security. Isn't that what neighbors are for?"
1,Does Not Work,"I bought this unit at our local grocery store because I wanted one I could program just to receive warnings in my immediate area. I got it all set up and I can clearly get the weather radio channel. I had it for a few months and fortunately, we have not had bad weather. However, I discovered this weekend when we were under flood warnings that the emergency signal part does not work at all. Unfortunately I can not locate the receipt for this item so I'm out of luck as they want twice as much money as it is worth to fix it since I can not prove it is less than one year old. Won't get another one."
1,Epic FAIL,"Bought this last summer. Within 2 months the unit stopped producing warnings. Our other radio, which is NOT a midland, continued to work and still works flawlessly. I have reset it to its factory default and it still will not produce an alarm. The weather station comes in clear, so not sure what the problem is. Threw it in the trash. Will not be replacing with another midland product."
2,I am ready to use it for target practice,"This unit is enough to make you completely INSANE. If there is a way to set this thing to go off for ONLY tornado warnings I have not found it. This thing goes off nonstop. I am in Kansas right now, about 3 miles from the Missouri river. Between the thunder storm warnings, the flood warnings, the canceled warnings, etc the stupid thing goes off every few minutes during a storm. I DON'T care about the small stream flood warnings, the thunder storm warnings, etc. especially at 3 am. It goes off so much that we often give up and unplug the stupid thing. Currently there is a massive storm outside and this stupid thing has gone off at least a dozen times in the last hour. We gave up and unplugged it. I was so annoyed by the dumb thing I had to get online to post a warning. Make sure when you pick a unit that you can set it to ONLY warn you when there is a tornado or some REALLY sever weather, especially in the middle of the night."
3,Midland Weather Radio,My father insisted that I have a weather radio - so we found this one online. My father also insisted that I return it and buy a good one. (I did not however return it.) I live in a suburb and should get pretty good reception - but if the radio is not physically in a window sill you can forget about understanding any of the actual weather reports. But the buzzer and lights will go off - so it does the job of giving me a warning. Just would not be able to use it in the basement if I had to retreat in a storm. I would not really recommend this one.
4,Invaluable and price is right!,"I bought this for my daughter's Kentucky apartment, since she is living alone and was worried about not knowing when tornadoes are sighted in her area. She has it set to just alert her for severe weather. It requires programming some of your local area weather codes into it, but if you go to the NOAA website, you can download all the codes that cover the surrounding counties (the machine will store 5 of them, which is plenty!). She (and I!!) now have some peace of mind that she'll be alerted whenever she is home. She now wishes she had a portable one to take to work with her!!"
5,Great for country living!,We live in the boonies and too far out to hear any alert sirens. This is a great product with a battery back up. Fabulous. The only drawback I've found is the alarm goes off for flash flooding. Flooding?It also has a lights: yellow for watch and red for warning that glow through the duration of the warning or watch. It's programmable for the county in which you live so it's even more personalized.Great product!
5,Best All Hazards warning system we have seen,"Do the research before buying other types of alert radios. This one does it all, including monitoring any number of neighboring zip codes. We have bought a second one and gave it as a gift to my wife's sister."
5,Everyone should have one!,"This is a great radio and could one day save your life! It's a wonderful piece of mind knowing if a tornado is in your area (even at night) that it will notify you and wake you up when the alarm goes off. I live in a rural area and can not hear the sirens in the nearest community. This model has the filter which allows you to only receive warnings in the county you live in (or select, and you can choose multiples!) I've had this radio for about two years and it has all the features you need including battery backup. NO problems with the A/C adapter as other people have mentioned. It will last if you take proper care of it. I would suggest your bedroom so it will wake you up at night and out of reach of young children. Great product!"
2,ANNOYING little thing,"First of all this radio is so counter-intuitive to use. You need directions to set it up and setup setup requires a lot of button-pressing. In this age a radio like this should be simple. And YES it beeps nonstop! Every time you press a button, it's BEEP BEEP BEEP! You try to set it up, and it wakes up anyone sleeping nearby. Eventually it just crapped out completely, and I was glad to put it in the trash."
1,Unreliable and Poorly-Made,"I received this item as a gift in December 2009. By January 2011, it no longer received radio broadcasts. I know the problem is with the unit, since I was able to get several weather stations on another radio. It still tells me the time, albeit poorly since there is a few minute per month drift.Even when this item was working, it had some annoying design flaws. The volume step levels are way too coarse for regular use. Simply put, there was no level between mute and the lowest volume level setting that wasn't deafening. It also has an annoying button beep that is very unpleasant.Another feature that would be useful is to allow the user to set the types of alerts that set off the alarm. That way, I could only have it wake me up in the middle of the night if there's a tornado warning, not just whenever there is a thunderstorm.From other reviews, it's apparent that I'm not the only person who had a unit fail. Save your money and go with another brand."
2,This thing is as bad as the weather!,"I hate this thing. It certainly alerts you of any severe weather, I'll give it that, but the sound it emits is a nightmare! I'd rather get up and listen to the weather on the TV than that thing! I usually hear thunder anyway and can get up, but sometimes I do sleep through it. With this thing it's impossible to sleep through anything.I live in an apartment and don't want to disturb my neighbors with this radio going off. We have severe weather from April-June here in West Texas and I do need a weather radio, but not one that would scare dead people out of their graves. I'll be buying another type instead."
1,DOA - Try another brand!,"No display or ability to program out of the box. This is the second poor quality Midland SAME receiver I've had, and the last. I suggest looking at alternative brands."
4,It can be great but boaters or outdoor users beware,"I bought 2 of these devices a while back. These devices have alerted most of the time for me. However, if you leave this device out in the sun, in the heat, in a boat on the lake, IT WILL NOT WORK. Sometimes if inside the house and the sun hits it then it picks up nothing but static. Several times I have had them in the car with me and they have quit working. It really doesn't take much heat to cause this. Then If I bring them inside, put them in the freezor for 5 minutes, they work perfectly. I have never experienced anything like this with any other radio. Otherwise, the reception is excellent. I can pick up stations on 6 of the 7 frequencies. Also, the programming of this device can be a headache, but like anything else, once you get the hang of it, its easy to change channels."
5,Quick and easy to use,Just purchased this radio because the one we had wore out. We live in Minnesota and have had lots of bad storms this year so this radio is a must. I love the SAME features or this would be going on constantly. Set it for the four couunty metro area where we live and that's the only alarms we get. I agree the alarm is the same for all alerts but to get a different alert alarm you have to go up in model and price. This one works just fine for us.
4,"Nice Radio, Awful Beeps","I really like this radio. It works well and lets me receive warnings only for my county here in southwest Indiana. However, like many other reviews state, the beeping noise this thing makes when the buttons are pressed is TOO LOUD!! Not quite a show stopper, but enough to take a star off a product that might have been a 5 star review. I love the radio. Hate the beeps."
2,slh128,received wr-100 radio and antenna fell off when unpacking it from box. Sent it back and ordered another one. Received it and antenna was loose on it. Needed a weather radio here in flooded Iowa so taped the ant. and am using it. Bad quality control somewhere.
3,Good Value for Simple WX Radio,"we've had this WX radio for two years now. It works well and the SAME code technology cuts down on alerts. However, you can't select audio alarms for specific events, such as tornados. We leave ours set to visual warning because we receive too many alerts for conditions like flash flooding. Eventually, I'd like upgrade to a radio with selectable alerts, if such things exist.The speaker is clear, and loud enough to hear across the room. The reception is good in our area (city). The amber and red status lights are handy to see if you are under a warning or watch.We've run this on AC and the back-up 3xAA batteries lasted about 2 years with a few power outages. I consider the battery life good.The antenna mount inside the plastic case broke about 6 month in. I opened the case and remounted the antenna with 2-part epoxy putty. It has been fine since then. I have to take off a star or two because it broke so easily."
2,Lasted exactly 13 months...then they ask you to pay $25 to fix it!,I didn't mind that this radio beeps for everything - I figure that's the price you pay for being informed/safe. BUT - I didn't like the fact that this radio only lasted 13 months. It's not like it did anything but sit on a shelf. I am very disappointed in this. I called the company and they told me that to get it fixed I would have to pay $25. OK...or I could buy a brand new one and not bother with this company. I would have liked it if it would have lasted. I guess I need to pay more for a higher quality radio - going to look for one right now.
2,VERY GOOD FOR THE PRICE,My Midland WR-100B weather radio with SAME is a great upgrade from the old style radios. Very good value of safety for the price. The company I work also bought one of these this year. Being able to select particular counties make it great for emergancy prepardeness.
1,Piece of junk - Don't buy -,I purchased the Midland WR100 Weather Radio and it worked well for about six weeks and completely stopped receiving any weather alerts. I reset the SAME weather channels and all I receive is static. I would NOT recommend the Midland WR100 weather radio. Now I have ordered another weather radio and am going to try and return this radio to Midland.
5,Easy to use,"I haven't had a weather alert yet, so I can't testify to it's reliability, but it was easy to program and has loud alarm."
1,WR-100 All Hazards Radio Review,Do not buy this radio. My radio quit working 2 weeks after I got it. I threw away the package and paper work and couldn't return it. This item can't really be rated because it quit after 2 weeks.
2,Didn't Last,Ive had this radio about a year and haven't used it much in that time period. I turned it on this week and the radio is dead. My next weather radio will be another brand.
5,NOAA RADIO,"A bit confusing for an older person, like me to set up, but it is what I needed for emergencies. They really do need to simplify things for folks who are older though...setting the weather band was a bit of a challenge and I found it confusing to get it set for time and such too."
5,Safety First,This weather and all hazards alert radio is wonderful. It let's me know exactly what the weather is doing in my area.
5,life saver,This weather monitor woke us with a tornado warning in the middile of the night and we were able to get to safty. A must have for all.
4,Midland WR-100B SAME Weather and All Hazards Alert Monitor with Alarm Clock,"It worked about a half hour after it was plugged in. We haven't set it up for local channels yet but, it certaintly lets you know when bad weather is approaching."
5,Great Emergency Weather Radio,This is a must have in any household to be alerted when severe weather is approaching. It can be set for just one or several counties and you can also set it for the way you are alerted. It's great!
4,Midlan WR-100 Weather radio,"The radio is simple to set up, works as advertised, is a good buy for the price. I can pick up broadcasts on several weather frequencies. The alert has already gone off once for a tornado warning. The only difference between the 100B and 100C models is the packaging. Make sure to plug the power supply into the correct jack in the back of the radio, there is a jack labeled PC that's about the same size as the power jack. They are clearly labeled."
4,Quality control,"The radio works fine but the electric plug won't stay in the jack. When it falls out it uses up the batteries. We have had to tape it in, which dosen't look very good."
5,Great little weather radio,"This is a very good radio. It makes you feel quite secure. Yes, it goes off during the night and wakes you up. I guess you can just turn it off if you want. However, the whole reason we purchased it for was to keep us informed. It even gives Amber Alerts. Very impressive!R Meyer"
2,No reception,"Received the radio in good condition. Read the instructions and programmed it, but could not receive weather information. Never received an alert so don't know if it worked for that. After talking with Midland and reprogramming the unit while on the phone with Midland it still did not work. Have returned it (at my expense) for a replacement."
3,weather radio,"Radio picks up the weather service broadcast, but so far I haven't received a warning whistle. Unit is somewhat staticy and works better in some parts of the house than others."
5,Quality for price,"Great little unit and easy to set up. Haven't had to use it yet, but the storm season is almost upon us, so we'll see."
4,Useful,"Since I bought the Hazard monitor, I have received two severe thunderstorm warnings and a flash flood warning. It is good to know that I will be woken up for any tornado warnings. However, the flash flood warning was at 2AM! (Not as annoying as a 3AM phone call though ;-) )"
5,Don't have an emergency without it!,"We have tried other weather radios with less than impressive results. This one works great and is very easy to program. It took about 2 minutes to setup up. The audio alarm sounds like a standard alarm clock. We cannot hear it go off when it's in the bedroom and we are in the living room, so if bad weather is expected, you might want to keep it in ear shot. It is very light and portable, so it's not a big deal."
3,Is it better?,Has the WR-100B addressed the potential problems of the WR-100 model? I found that the WR-100 did not work properly during an actual tornado warning when surrounding counties were added to radio.
1,A Terrible Receiver,"I was completely disappointed with this radio. I live in the city where our local NOAA transmitter is located and this radio was almost unable to pick up the station. It produced horrible static and the signal would occasionally fade out completely. The reception was so poor as to be totally useless for SAME reception. I know that the problem is not due to our location as I have two other radios with weather band reception (without SAME) that work fine, and I have since purchased another weather alert radio by Oregon Scientific that picks up the station without any trouble.I assume the unit that I purchased was defective, as I cannot believe anyone would positively review a radio that worked this poorly. I wish you the best of luck should you decide to purchase one."
1,China cheap & 1 Year warranty is worthless,I have purchased 3 of these in the last 6 years and have had enough.The one year warranty on this Chinese garbage is timed just right.All of mine stopped working after 1 year.
3,"It is weather radio, right?","I have no issue with this weather radio with one exception. Why on Earth does it have an ""off"" function? You get the ""beep,beep"", you push snooze. No problem. You get another ""beep, beep"" later in the middle of the night and you accidentally hit that snooze button twice, now your weather radio is off and is now a very worthless clock. Seriously, why even make this a possibility? Who would ever use this machine as a clock? Oh and say you have a pending ""watch"" out for your area. When they cancel that watch, the radio goes from ""weather"" function to ""clock"" function again. Make sure you switch it back or your screwed should there be severe weather on its way. But again, why would it be possible to turn the warning system off? That is the whole purpose of the machine. You could always unplug it if you wanted it to stop alerting you. And the beep is quite loud, but i guess that is the point."
2,Midland WE-100B SAME Weather Radio,"The problem I encountered with this radio is that you cannot select the particular alerts you want to receive. I purchased this monitor to alert me of any tornadios or serious weather potentially affecting my area. Since you cannot choose the weather alerts only, the radio is going to alert me (and wake me up) for any type of alert including Amber alerts and tests sent out from my county at all times of the day or night. I purchased a monitor from Radio Shack with a larger display that can pop up for better reading and I can choose the alerts I want to receive and it has been very good in sending only the alerts that I have chosen to receive. It also scans automatically for the best channel to receive braodcasts which the Midland WE-100B SAME Weather Radio does not. You have to choose your channel from a list according to your county. The Radio Shack radio costs a little more but not much more but it's features are well worth paying the difference."
5,A must have,"I am very pleased with this Alert Monitor, which is very reliable when it comes to protect yourself and your family from sudden climate hazards, which unfortunately happen more and more all over the world. I have seen increased number of severe storms in my area and this handy device alarms us whenever something dangerous approaches. It is affordable and very valuable for the price. That's why I highly recommend it."
5,Safety First,"I have only lived in Florida for a short time, but had previously heard of these radios. After having seen the reviews of others, I took a chance and ordered one. I am glad I did! It appears easy to use, and although I have not had to use it yet, I'm glad to have it in my home."
2,What a waste of money,I have had this Midland weather radio less than 3 years and after 1 1/2 years of just sitting there on my night table; it just one day stopped working. My hand held Realistic weather band radio I bought at Radio Shack after 12 years is still working. This Midland radio which was highly recommended as the best weather radio is not true; what a waste of money.
2,Works but has annoying flaws,"I've had this radio for over 2 years and am about to ditch it. It receives warnings/alerts well, but has some annoying issues. Sometimes it turns on for no reason, no warnings or alerts issued, just simply goes off. It does this often 2 or 3 times a week. Sometimes during the day, sometimes in the middle of the night! When it does this, the lighted dial does not go off, so you have a bright light shining in your eyes in the middle of the night. The only way to shut it off is to use the Menu to reset the light. So, it is being replaced."
4,Very good for the price i paid.,"this is a very good product. i got it for less, when there was a price drop. the ability to program in locations around your house to receive weather alerts applicable only to you is very helpful. It would have been a lot better if there was the added facility to choose what kind of hazards one might want to know about in the middle of the night when at bed. But that might be asking for too much for the price paid."
2,The Box Who Cries Wolf,"This is partly my own fault for not researching more, but I was shocked to learn that this has no way of filtering the events it screams at you about. I only wanted this to tell me when there was a tornado warning: a thunderstorm watch or a high wind advisory is not worth waking me up at 3am for.My advice: spend more and get something that only alerts you for things that matter."
1,I wish we had the weather radio,"We did not receive the radio. Weeks after we should have received it, the seller was contacted and I was promised a review of the shipping in 7-14 days. After two weeks I filed a complaint with Amazon and received a refund. I did not ever recieve an explanation from Antonline (the seller)."
5,I feel better having it.,"I bought it after I slept through our city's tornado sirens. Once the radio is set up, it will alarm if there is any sever weather in the area."
4,Nice & Inexpensive,"I purchased 2 of these, one for my wife and one for a gift. Has worked perfectly for the past month. Easy to program for county alerts and you can do up to three--I did 2. Much better reception than our previous radio. This one gets moved from one room to the next every morning as my wife gets dressed so it gets a bit of abuse. I would recommend it."
4,Home Safety,"We gave this radio to our daughter (and her family) as they live in the Mid-West and in areas subject to numerous severe thunderstorms and tornadoes. This device provides her (and us) added security knowing that they can be alerted whenever the NWS issues a weather warning. The only disadvantage is that you can't select which NWS alerts that the alarms goes off - thus, you get alert for Flash Floods which isn't really an issue for her."
2,Useful while it lasted,"I purchased the Midland WR100, which I assume is an earlier version of this product, three years ago from Amazon. This month it stopped working. I was going to replace it until I read a review that said it needed batteries even when it was plugged in. With new batteries it worked for a few days before the batteries were depleted again. Although this radio served us well for those three years, that seems entirely too short a time for such a product to function. I am replacing it with the ""First Alert Public Alert Radio with S.A.M.E."""
2,Wide area coverage,Because the radio is not zip-code specific I get alarms and warnings for surrounding areas sometimes fifty or more miles away. These are most troublesome when the radio alarm goes off at one or two in the morning.It is esay to set up and otherwise works well.
4,2Nd one would not work,"Purchased two, first one worked fine but second did not work. The company was out of stock. I am still waiting for my refund/return postage to be credited to my acount"
4,good stuff,"when you need decaf black tea, this is the best i have found, the typhoo flavor and strength are there."
1,Damaged goods,"I love this tea...in fact it is the only hot drink I drink and I have ordered it several times but I won't again!Several of the bags are torn...when you open the silver foil pack...always very careful when I do...you can see small tears in many of the bags and of course the tea is leaking out.I have never had this happen before...and I always buy this brand. So either this was a bad ""batch"" or the quality control is slipping.Buyer beware!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,always good,I live in Japan and it is little difficult for me to getdecaffeinated tea bag here.I sent it to my brother's address.It is really helpful to find this kind of stuff on the amazon.com!
3,looks good.. but...,"This looks like a great boxed set, but I wonder how you can have a complete Punk collection without 1 Social Distortion song on it. I realize that not every band can be included, but come on.. They were around since the late 70's early 80s in the SolCal punk scene and influenced a majority of modern punk and rock.Oh well, that was just a thought. I'll probably still get this."
2,The Real Epitaph,"It somehow just makes sense that thirty years later you'd see a cd version of the same type of lame ""new wave"" cash-in albums that cropped up like mushrooms in '77-'78. The predictable and the loss leaders are all here, in a way that really makes me oddly nostalgic"
1,'No thanks' is right!,"What should have been a landmark collection of one of the most influential and exciting periods in popular music is diluted with the bland, radio-ready sounds of Blondie, Elvis Costello, Mink DeVille, The Pretenders, Joe Jackson, Ian Dury, The Boomtown Rats, and Talking Heads. These featherweights had little or nothing to do with punk or rebellion--that's why they became popular. A year before this collection was released, I wrote to Rhino urging them to include the following songs: Larry Wallis: Police Car, Chelsea: Right to Work, Alberto Y Los Trios Paranoias: Kill, Molls: White Stains, Users: Sick of You Iggy And The Stooges: Raw Power, Agent Orange: Bloodstains,Unnatural Axe: They Saved Hitler's Brain, La Peste: Better Off Dead, Clash: What's My Name?, Penetration: Nostalgia, Altered Images: Day's Wait, The Table: Do the Standing Still, X-X: You're Full of S**t, Sid Vicious: My Way, Pere Ubu: My Dark Ages, Diodes: Child Star. Did they pay attention?"
5,More than the sum of the parts,"This is a great compilation; with just about everything you could want from the 70's punk movement. By mixing lots of 'hits' along with some less known songs, it provides a super overview of the sound of those times. As with any collection of parts, anyone can quibble about specific inclusions or oversights. But it does a great job of spanning the range of punk, and there's nothing dramatic missing (except for the Sex Pistols, but they reportedly declined to participate). Bottom line, the whole package works, and easily gets a 5-star rank. Just play it loud!"
3,a dog's breakfast or badly programmed radio,"Whilst it is great that this collection exists, and I admit it contains many of the best singles from that era, I agree with a lot of the criticsim that others seem to have made that it has been put together with too little thought. The track sequence doesn't make much sense and as such may discourage listeners from listening all the way thru. It has the same unsatisfactory feel as a CD changer in the boot of the car. However, I have few criticisms of the content, the person who did compile it was at least familiar with the songs that everyone was into in those days."
3,Mixed feelings,"I'll keep this short.PROS:- Great packaging and booklet- A lot of great songs- Some not so obvious selections (both bands and songs)- Wire's ""Mannequin""- The large box has the four CDs in their own individual cases, so you won't have to lug around a cumbersome box.CONS:- $65.00? Are you joking?- It would have been better if each band only got one song.- The Dils are on it. The Dils suck. You just try to listen to ""Mr. Big"" and not feel stupid.- A lot of the songs are very obvious choices.At the moment I'm typing this, the used price is just under $35. That's a good price for this compilation. Keep in mind though, that this is best for people who are getting into the music and not those of us who are familiar. I know that I own, or did at one point, own a large portion of this."
4,REBEL!,"Featuring greats like The Ramones, The Clash, Patti Smith, Elvis Costello, and MORE! Note that you do not see Avril Lavigne or Good Charlotte."
5,Stop hesitating,"This is an excellent box set of an odd era. When music labelled as ""punk"" came out, it seemed kind of dangerous and anti-establishment. The loud guitars, short and fast songs, and dangerous band names like The Clash, The Jam, The Ramones, and Television were pretty scary. The funny thing is that many of the songs on this box set have memorable melodies, good harmonies, and fine instrumental work.As with any box set from various artists, it is easy and fun to second guess the track selection. For example, I think LA punk is completely over-represented. Also I would have liked Plastic Bertrand's Ca Plan Pou Moi and something by the Bizzaros. And where are the Suicide Commandos?Nonetheless, even if you own half of the songs, stop hesitating and buy the set. It's another quality Rhino product with great sound and a great book."
4,Very good introduction to '70's punk.,"This boxed set has many great and classic punk songs. I would recommend it particularly to young people today who didn't live in the late '70's. Back in '78 or so, some of this type of music is what really got me interested in rock'n'roll to begin with. I think it's a great collection, but Elvis Costello, Joe Jackson, and some others who were really not true punk rock, don't really belong on this set. However, it's good to see many of the New York (CBGB) bands here. This is the true rebellious music of the 1970's, just like rockabilly was in the 1950's, even though the genres and styles are completely different."
2,Worked for about a month.,"It was fine for a month or so. Then, the ""lo-batt"" warning came on. I changed the batteries, and it worked for a day, then back to ""lo-batt"". Now, it reads low battery all the time even with new bateries. grrrr."
2,I will not buy,I am glad i read other reviews before purchasing this. I dont think anyone should profit from this but MB20.
2,Too light and flimsy,"My cat doesn't use this as a scratcher at all. If he tries, it kinda flops all over the place because it's made of lightweight plastic. I tried sprinkling catnip on the carpeted part and he almost chewed the thing up! I would not recommend the Scratchy mountain."
2,Small and Flimsy,"I was hoping this product would be a replacement for the messy cardboard cat scratching posts that my cat has liked over the years. I was really surprised to see how small and flimsy the product really was. I actually have an average sized cat, 8lbs. and it wobbles underneath her, there's not much support under the carpet scratching area, so I finally had to use a 3 lbs. weight to weigh down and stabilize the scratching post. Daisy still doesn't use it unless I put her on top of it, even then the scratching post is so small she can only fit half of her body on it. I've tried catnip, toys, etc. but she doesn't really like it. I wouldn't recommend this product, unfortunately, I'll keep looking for a scratching post that she'll love."
3,Review of Watch Pin Remover,"Nice remover, but I did have to modify it to take a 22 24 mm pin from the watch band. Dople pins have to be placed accurately or will break.......... but it did serve my purpose........ how long it will last......... time will tell.............."
1,broke during first use,"Poorly made product that snapped the first time I used it. Within two cranks the plastic housing, which is very thin, and holds the threaded metal push-piece, split, rendering the entire thing useless. Right in the trash."
2,"Good tool, but useless for the watch Amazon paired it with.","This is an average of 4 stars for WatchMaterial and no stars for Amazon.I bought the tool along with the Casio MTG900DA-8V Watch because the Amazon product page said it was ""better together"". It is useless on that watch's band.It is a quality tool. It was shipped promptly at a reasonable cost. When I complained that the tool would not work with the watchband, WatchMaterial made a prompt refund with no hassle. I would not hestitate to deal with them again. I would have given them 5 stars if the copy for the tool warned that there are a lot of watch bands that are not compatible with this tool.I would not trust Amazon's pairings.If you are considering this tool (or others), go to WatchMaterial dot com and look at their Education section on sizing watch bands. If you are not sure that the tool will work with your band, give them a call first."
3,Works well but overpriced,"First of all, this thing works well for my watch and my wife's.Second, the manufacture is very poor, it is made in China, and of the lowest quality level of all products made in China. The manual is a piece of bw paper of size 1""x2.5"", outside the box.Third, as I was born and educated in China, the manufacture cost of this thing is no more than $1, including the design cost. If they sell it for $5-8, I will give it 4-5 star.Last, the seller ships very fast, this is great."
1,Too small...useless,"None of my bands would fit this tool. I have standard size bands and this tool is just too small. It only fits ladies watches. Also, the pins are too fragile. Why do you think they need to include THREE!"
1,worst product on the market!,Bought this pin remover last week and have already broken all 4 pins! No instructions came with the device and the little folded piece of paper that came with the device with a web site for instructions was a hoax as they said nothing there about this particular device. What a waste of time and money!
1,Product is not worth the price. NO instructions on how to use it.,Save your Money. There are no instructions on how to use it and what watch bands it will work on. The item was overpriced and the seller should give a better product discription of what is in the package.
3,it works But.,"This iteam does work . It is not like the higher quilty pin remover's though. Must realy take your time and make sure that every thing is perfect before you start, or you will break or bend the pin !!!!"
2,Better Ones Out There,"This item has quite a good feel to it when first using it, and doesn't feel very ""plastic-y"" like most of the other tools out there, but from there the praise ends.The height adjustment tool is a notched springboard at the end of the tool. The purpose of this being that if you've got a thicker band, you can press down on it to align it with the pin. The problem with this system is that it causes the band to be unstable, and if it slips on the surface of that spring board, the pin will bend and snap off.Also, the pins included with this tool, while longer than most, are the flimsiest item I've ever seen. I realize these pins are supposed to bend to protect your watch under too much pressure, but minimal pressure not only caused them to bend but snap completely! I went out and bought another link remover, frustrated with this one's flawed design, and it worked much better."
4,Generally nice product. Performs as expected.,"Generally nice product. Performs as expected. The build quality on the tool is cheap plastic with metal. Feels flimsy and cheap, but it worked, even against hard set watch bracelet pins. The only suggestion I have is to turn the spindle slowly with one hand, then guide it into the pinhole, to get it out."
4,This tool does the job.,This is a nifty little tool to have for watch bracelet pin removal. Easy to use. i've adjusted the bracelets on two of my watches and two others for a coworker - tool has already paid for itself!
2,Low Quality,"Not a bad tool for the price. Very cheaply made with low quality materials.I found it easy to use, though some will find the lack of instructions difficult to operate the tool properly. Would be a much better item if the metal was of a much better quality."
4,Slick little tool!,"This is one of those gadgets you rarely need but are so handy when you do. It took me less than ten minutes to adjust the band on a new Seiko men's chrono I received for the holidays. A little pricier than some but I think the few dollars more gets you a better tool. Advice: YouTube has a few instructional videos on using this specific tool. It's pretty intuitive. Also, you might want to put a drop or two of 3-in-1 oil on it. Mine was binding a little until I did."
3,broken after removing 3 links,"it worked well until the small pin broke, i was able to finish the job without going to a jeweler."
3,Excelent tool,I a few times and I realy like the functionality of the device. The only concer I may express is the pin removers are not strong enough to support more than 3 aplications. After I used the tool with the pin removal after 3 the pin removal get broke and not only once I used for various of my watch bands and the same happen..
5,Easy to use,This product worked perfectly and was easy to get the hang of. I have had one of these tools before but the quality of this one is much better. The pins seem to be very strong but just in case it comes with extras.
1,Unsatisfactory,Didn't have the extra pins. Wasn't able to repair watch by removing bands to shorten band length.
3,Good if you are a handyman,This is not for everyone. Purchase this only if you are a 'do-yourself' man and are comfortable using tools around the house.I thought this was also pretty expensive for the money I paid but it saved me a trip to the jewellers and I got back the money as well.
5,It is a little good fella!,"Got mine today, shipping was fast. Worked like a charm on my watch bracelet. I didn't need to try hard at all. But if you have somethingwider than men's standard, it probably won't fit, just my two cents."
1,Not worth the money,"This watch pin remover came with four extra 'drill bits', and all of them were flimsy and broke within the first half hour of using it. Not to mention that by the time I put the second or third drill bit in the plastic casing on the actual unit cracked. I would not recommend this product."
1,Junk.............,"The second time I used this contraption the plastic base broke, rendering it useless. Don't get it. Instead, use a tiny nail and a small hammer, tapping the pins out of the watch band(make sure you tap the right direction)."
3,Not as straightforward as you would think,"I bought this item to adjust the watch band on my seiko arctura.I had a few challenges but I think the adjustment worked out.(Luckily!)I was sweating a bit.My complaint was the pin to push out the watch band pins is too short. Others have mentioned this.Also, I couldn't decide if I liked how tight or loose I wanted my watch,I ended up removing almost all the links...I was a bit worried putting the watch band back together as some of the pins didn't fit as snugglyas before I started messing with this tool.Like I said, it ended up working out ok but this may not be the best product for the faint of heart....good luck!"
3,Satisified...almost,"The product works well to remove pins from a watchband but is not useful for inserting them back into the band. I had to go to a jewelers to add pins and an extra link. So few me, it was a waste of money."
3,"Good and usable, but...","This tool is good and usable and I bought it together with a watch where I needed it. Its is easy to work with them and the justage is good. But I think if I use it often (and I think this will happen!), the pin will be broken soon; and there are only three left. So I must be carefully... ;-)In this case I can give only three stars: usefully and good, but possibly soon damaged -> two stars. And for the cheap price the third star."
3,Cheap But Effective,"The product is definitely over-priced. I can't imagine it costing any more than $2 to manufacture in China. It did not come with the 3 additional pins advertised, but fortunately I didn't need them. I was able to successfully use the tool on 3 of my watches. BTW. It comes with no directions; it took me about 5 minutes to figure out how to use the tool, but then I'm a bit slow :-) If you need to adjust a few watches and can't find anything less expensive; buy it, otherwise buy something of better quality."
5,Perfect,Tool is of very good quality and works well to remove pins that are very firmly set in the watch.
1,plastic junk!,"This plastic gadget broke on me with the very first usage! It came with no instructions. I was obliged to spend yet more money to get a jeweler to remove a link on my watch. I did not bother, due to the hassle, to return this cheapo peace of $%&#. Think twice about buying this, a jeweler may be quicker and cheaper !!!"
2,Overkill for simple pin removal; doesn't work for all watch bands.,"Item was well made and is indeed capable of compressing a watch pin to allow adjustment. However, I also tried a roller tip pen tip to compress the spring pin and found it was easier and faster to use. At least on my watch, the major adjustment in band length is not through moving the pin a notch or two, but rather in removing (or adding) links to the band. This adjustment requires a completely different tool to bend open and then close the adjustable steel links."
4,Does the job,"Just used this tool to take links out of a mens Citizen watch. It got the job done. Contrary to some of the reviews, this tool DOES come with extra pins. One bad thing (although it didn't affect me) is that the slider tool doesn't pull all the way out, so you may not be able to use this on wider bands."
5,Great tool!,I finally used the Paylak TSLK3 to adjust the bracelet length on my wife's watch. It was a breeze! Couldn't have been any simpler - done in 3 minutes and this was my first time!I just need to adjust another band and the item would have paid for itself. Saved me money and time from having to travel to a watch shop to get it done.A sturdy and compact tool and they provide a lot of information on their website explaining how to adjust different types of watch bands too. Awesome!!
5,Works perfectly,"I thought this would be poor quality and would only use it to fit my one watch but after using it, I know I will be able to do hundreds of watches before this thing breaks. If you didn't have this, the job would be 1+ hours fumbling with many thumbtacks (which I did) but with this, it will take no more then 3 minutes."
4,Good product if you know what you're doing,"I buy a new watch every month or so, so investing in a pin remover was a good idea. However, the actual pin on the pin remover is weak material. I broke my first one due to improper alignment. Granted, this was my 1st time and I didn't exactly know better. I would gladly pay extra for stong steel or titanium pins. Overall a good buy though for 15 bucks."
4,Performed as advertised,After purchasing a cheaper item that broke after the first pin I decided to try again with the TSLK3. It worked as advertised although it is a little pricey.
4,Worked great and saved a lot of time.,"It's kind of cheap made, but it sure does save a lot of time and effort. Re-sized a couple of seiko watch bands and it was very easy to do."
1,Useless,"I am not a watch repairer by trade, but reasonably intelligent. When I opened the box, I discovered that there was no directions. No flyer on how to contact the seller. In other words, a $6.95 piece of useless plastic."
1,Waste of time & money,"Here's my list of grievances with this product:-No instructions-Website that supposedly contains instructions has the poorest directions I've ever read-Broke tip on first try & guess what? no instructions about how to install replacement tips-Spent more time trying to install tips, unscrewing all the microscopic screws looking for a clue, than actually working on the watch-Then proceeded to bend the 3 other tips...while I am a self professed amateur at sizing watch bands, these tips are definitely flimsy-Amazon image makes it appear to be sturdy, perhaps piece of high quality metai...it's not!-11.95 for cheap plastic & metal that probably cost $.08 to make (hey maybe these guys are actually brilliant)And last but not least...after investing 2 hours trying to figure it out, tossing it straight into the garbage can wasn't satisfying at all!Save yourself the aggravation and spend the 11.95 on a jeweler."
2,It's okay...,There's not much to say about this tool. It works okay. It's cheap. Don't expect to be blown away by this product.
2,I had trouble,"I kept bending the knock out pins on the unit. Perhaps I was not patient enough, but I found that with this unit one had to be very, very careful to line everything up exactly right. The watch band is not held securely in place and moves, knocking everything out the alignment. Thats not to say that this unit will not work properly if you are very careful."
1,Watch Band Pin Remover and Link Remover,I received the item marked Bracelet Pin Removing Tool (with spare pins) It is marked TSLK3 with no instructions. The item has been useless to me as I have not beenable to use it.
1,Terrible Product,Terrible product with easy to bent pins. Stay away. It is not worth the money. It simply does not work.
5,Perfect!,I had a Fossil watch that needed a link taken out. This product took it out perfectly without damaging the watch or using much force on my part.
4,Satisfies my needs,"This tool works fine for my needs. I have a watch with a band that loosens up over time, and I end up having to remove a link after several months. I can also re-size the band when I purchase a new one (I've worn the watch for 10 years, and the bands closing mechanism breaks down after just 2 years, average, so I've purchased several bands.). I don't think this would hold up under continual use, but works fine in my circumstance."
2,Small bands only,"Product is too small for large watches, more specifically larger watch bands. I tried three of my watches and none fit into the work area of this product. Probably useful for smaller bands, but I could not test this product."
2,Try another product.,"This tool works but the tip brakes easily when installing a pin/bar. It's hard to position and alight the band because of the spring plate. The shape of the band might also make installation/removal difficult. If the band on your watch has progressively smaller links, it won't be possible to place the band flush against the rest of the tool. If this is happens, the misalignment will cause the pin to break (100% guaranteed). I went through three pins (you get three spares, lucky me!). Also, because of multiple slips due to the tip breaking, the band received minor scratches on it's side. Being careful just doesn't cut it.This tool is NOT worth it's cost. If you're looking for a dependable and safe link remover stay away from this one and other models like it. You are better off going to a jeweler and having them adjust the band for you."
4,Flimsy but it works!,If your not working on watches for a living this tool will be just fine. A little flimsy but for the money it does work! Great for adjusting the occasional watch band.
4,Watch band pin remover,This little gadget works great for removing the pins. Advice: make sure you have the correct size pin. If the pin you use is too small it will bend and break.
4,Must Have for Watch Enthusiast,"I bought this tool back in February and I have now used is a few times. It has worked flawlessly, and I have not broken a pin yet. As others have mentioned, keep the watchband and tool-pin aligned. Some times the clasp might might make it more difficult to keep horizontal alignment, watch for this as well as vertical alignment. It has certainly paid for itself for me. If you get new watches from time to time with metal braclets then you need a tool like this. Update 2010.07.18: Used this tool again today and have now used it for many watches since I bought it in Feb/2008; It has worked flawlessly on each one and I have not broken a single pin yet. Wishes; 1. It went slightly wider; 2. it had removable notches on stop so that if the pin was near the clasp it would still allow the band to easily lay straight. One of best tool deals if you size more than 1 watch band."
1,Poor Quality,I just bought this product 3 days ago and it's already broken. The plastic that covers the metal cracks easily. Don't buy.
1,What a piece of C-----P,this device is totally useless - they must have paid others to make those good posts - the only time the screw will lower the pin is if there is no watch band in place. put the watchband in and the moment the pin is screwed down and meets the resistance of the watch band pin. it stops being able to push down it just slip skips (the part it screws through to lower sort of separates). will be calculating how much I will lose my returning. this useless item.
2,Didn't work for me,"I had hoped that I would be able to use this device to adjust the size of the watch I ordered at the same time. No directions were supplied. I was able to remove a pin, but when replaced it was loose and would slip out at unpredictable times. I ended up appealling to a local jeweler, who was able to make the adjustment and at lower cost that the device."
1,Poorly Made!,"Plastic housing broke around metal components when in use. This pin removing tool was not the least expensive. There were other ""manual"" tools that were not as pricey but probably are more durable than this Paylak product."
5,Professional Style Watch Band Pin Remover,"After reviewing many other cheaper products being offered, I decided to get this one because it appeared to be better built with a round grooved thumbwheel for precise control, threaded screw pin drive and spring-loaded platform to get that perfect position to push out the existing watch band pins. This professional-grade instrument worked very well and was worth the extra cost."
5,THE tool to make what appears to be a difficult job pretty easy!,"I've had a few watches with metal bands over the year for which links must be removed for them to fit. One time, I took a watch to a jeweler and he managed to scratch up the bracelet part significantly. For other watches, I had some success going to different jewelers but I believe it cost me up to $20 for the job in NYC. Also, I had to leave the watch there and if I decided it was too tight a few days later....well, what would I do? I also McGuyver'd a few adjustments of my own over the years but each was an extremely difficult task.In any event, I bought a nice new watch to replace one I had sold and decided to get this tool so I could do the job myself. WOW! It makes ALL the difference having the right tool for the job. It's pretty straight forward to use and I probably took out 4 links or so in 5-10 minutes. Glad I have this handy little tool for any future watches. Well worth the relatively small investment! Get one!"
2,Not what you expect,"I purchased the watch band pin remover at the recommendation of the internet. I was only going to buy the watch and then I decided maybe the band pin remover would make it easier for me to shorten the band. The pin remover does not work with the watch band on Seiko SGG709. I didn't return the band pin remover for two reasons: (1) I switched watch bands from one of my old non working watches to the Seiko SGG709 and it works just fine. I didn't have to shorten the band at all. (2) The band pin remover did work on another watch that I had, therefore, I decided to keep it. If I had to do it all over again I would not have purchased the band pin remover. I guess the best thing I can tell you is if you see something you like BUY IT and ONLY IT and you should be ok."
4,good tool - recouped the cost right away,A good product. Would like to have been sent instructions along with it even though it's pretty intuitive. Recouped the cost after sizing two watch bands.
1,DON'T BUY THIS!!,As many others have said--this is a worthless piece of plastic junk!! MUCH better to buy the Aluminum one for around $5 but still use with caution as the pins may break.
4,It's sturdy and it works,"Well made for its task, and includes spare pins if you goof. Straightforward to operate and does the job fine."
5,nice little tool,as soon as it arrived i used the tool to remove links from a watch band. works very well.
4,Simple and quick.,"Once you follow a simple instruction to align your bracelet in this contraption, removing a pin is a very easy and safe operation. And there is not a scratch on the bracelet, unlike after you take it to your local watch repairman. And you can adjust your bracelet as often as you want."
2,Would not buy again,I thought I could save some time by not having to take my watches in to have them fitted by buying this. This is not the tool you need to resize your watchband. The product itself is somewhat cheaply made. I ended up throwing it away after I was done with it.
2,not suitable for all watch bands,"This tool does serve its simple purpose of pushing the pin out of and into the band, but be careful-1) You have to hold the band very carefully so that the push pin of this tool is aligned properly.2) This tool would work well for a band with wider links. For narrower links, however, it will push it against the side at an angle and BEND the pin inside the link. Removing a link close to the clasp is a very finicky maneuver and you'll likely mangle the band. It'll be very difficult to bend it back into shape and you'll likely have to throw away the link. It was a very costly lesson for my new (expensive) watch.. fortunately, I had just enough links left to survive this trial by error."
5,A Breeze to operate,This was great little gadget to have handy on Xmas morning. Got two new watches adjusted in just a few minutes.
5,It just works!,I bought this pin remover to adjust my new Citizen... and it simply works! I also used it to adjust a Seiko and a Swatch and again... it works flawlessly! Highly recommended!
4,"very good, as advertised",The price was right except the shipping costs were high compared to the price of the merchandise. The product fulfilled my needs as long as care was taken pushing out the watch band pins.
1,Doesn't work with any of my men's watches,Bands do not fit into the slot provided. Tried to use it on my wife's watch and the metal pin broke on first use.
1,broke on first try of using it,i pulled it out of the box...... twisted the handle...... saw the plastic holding the turnstile break and make it unusable.......
4,Good Product,This product is a quality item. It may take some practice to get used to using it. I broke the first pin but luckily they include extra pins. You will need a small screwdriver to change the pins. A eyeglass screwdriver may work.
1,Terrible,"I opened the package to find that the plastic collar that holds the pin holder assembly in place was cracked, straight from the factory. As most of the stresses involved should be in line with the pin, however, I figured I'd attempt to use it anyway. Unfortunately, I soon found out that the pin doesn't retract far enough to allow for a standard-width men's watch band, making the entire unit unusable for its purpose. The only good thing about the item was that it came with extra pins, one of which I was able to use (simply by aligning it with the watch pin and pressing against a hard surface) to actually adjust my watch band. By far, this is the worst product I've ever received from Amazon."
4,Good tool for smaller band watches,"For the price this tool worked very well. Much more precise than a simple hammer + pin tool (much less risk of damaging your watch).Make sure you check your watch band width, as this will not work on very large band sizes."
5,Great tool!,"very easy to use and great quality. i've used a different watch band remover (blue watch band remover) in the past, and this one is much better qaulity."
4,"Love the product, will buy it but...","Feels like a ripoff...they release seasons 1 and 2, then suddenly decide to just stop releasing seasons and give us the whole package at once? Guess I'll be buying seasons 1 and 2 yet again, as part of this set."
4,GREAT SHOW!!,"only downside was the price, and all tv show dvd's suck since they only put like 4 episodes on each dvd, sux having to get up & change the dvd so often."
2,Unfair!!,"Ok, I LOVE this show. I already bought the first two seasons, and I really want to own the whole collection. However, I'm not so keen on paying for the first two seasons yet again. I really want all these episodes, but have you checked out the price? Whoever made the decision to release this set before releasing the remaining episodes separately is obviously a con-artist of some kind, and people just don't appreciate being taken. Shame on you!"
5,My favorite Comedy Central Show of all time,"Dr. Katz is the ultimate stand-up sitcom. Jonathan Katz is a legendary stand-up comedian with a unique rhythm and wit. H. Jon Benjamin is a great conversational comedian. He can improv material as well as anything anyone else can sit down and write. Jonathan Katz plays Dr. Katz Professional Therapist in the show, and H. Jon Benjamin plays Dr. Katz's son Ben. Ben is in his 20s and still lives with his father with no career prospects or ambition. Dr. Katz's patients are a revolving door of guest stand-up comedian appearances. The only negative aspect for some is the Squiggle Vision. If you can get past the squiggly animation, everything else is amazing."
3,"HATE TO THROW ICE DOWN YOUR BACK, BUT...","It's for rabid fans only. Yeah, I like roots (country) rock, especially from guys who really come from the hills - but there was a reason the OMD never re-recorded most of these tunes - they were just Ok. Nothing special. I put my copy up for sale the day after I listened to it."
1,lots of static,this radio has a real hard time getting reception without static. i don't know the reason because other radios i've had work fine in the same locations. in addition this thing sucks batteries. i get about 12 hrs of use before it is kapoot.
4,perfect for what it's designed to do...,"... which is be small, and receive radio signals. it does both of those things very well. if i get static while listening to an FM station, i flip the little city/rural switch, and most of the time, everything is better. the lock button is very handy, since it deactivates all buttons on the device to avoid accidental channel flipping or powering down. the small nub on the middle radio preset button is extremely helpful, since it allows me to find my favorite radio station if i'm fiddling around with the walkman in my pocket.the only setback: i did notice that it sucks batteries quicker than it should. other than that, i love it."
4,Of Interest,"Up front: the video quality is marginal, at best, and a whole lotta arty production. However, it's worth it for the version of ""You're So Square"" and some jazzy takes on Mitchell standards."
5,Very good Product!,"Could not be happier with this crib! My husband was fearing the worst when he had to put it together (like most furniture-in-a-box), but assembly was very easy-few pieces and assembly took 20-30 minutes. Borders and additional toys fit on easily as well. This is a sturdy and good-looking crib that should last us a long time."
3,Not so interesting,"Some of the stuff in this book is redundant in a sense that language specs and extensions spec are already available online then why put in there.Second, I found the explanation more like notes+spec form. Not at all for an newbie person and for an expert it does not offer anything new. As it starts with FBO, RenderTarget, PBOs etc. many things have changed over the period, including GLSL specs.Book structure is also quite confusing to me, it starts with some concepts of advance OpenGL(!) and then it is more like ShaderXn series with appendix and last chapeters full of GLSL and ARB specs.Buy this book if you know what you are looking for, check appendix first."
3,Shop around before you buy sony..,"Although Sony is the creator of ""MiniDisc"" and has release several diffrent models of Minidisc Players and Recorders, i recomend you shop around for diffrent brands before you buy, I bought a sony Minidisc player model (MZ-R50) sold on the Brand Name and the sleek sexy design, (it's orange), Now its broken, after a few months of use the right headphone channel stoped working, I can't say that i have lost trust in sony as being a good manufacture but they don't stand behind thier products as well as they say. the price of getting it repaired was estimated to be twice the cost of the player itself because of labor. You can buy an affordable Panasonic or Kenwood Minidisc players for a better price."
4,Good value for $$,I got this MD player as a birthday gift and I can't stop using it! I can now get all my Mp3 files onto a tiny disc!great value for your money
4,A great book to get you started with this kind of book,"I confess. This is the first sex fantasies book I've ever purchased. I enjoyed quite a few scenerios in the book, and appreciated the authors clarity of chapters... in other words, you know exactly what type of fantasy it's going to be before you start the chapter. However, there were quite a few that just didn't do anything for me, but that's just me. There's also a short section in the end of fantasies for men, so it's nice for my man. Overall, I enjoyed the help to get away from reality."
1,No Star if I could give it a Zero,How do you give something one star that doesn't work? Followed the instructions exactly and it did nothing. What a waste of time. Returning this useless piece.
2,Not the best from La Crosse,"I purchased 2 of these in Dec.2010 ( 11 months ago ) These units are not the easiest to read due to the design. I placed one in a mud room the other in a basement workshop. One has stopped working after 6 months ( I tried changing batteries a couple of times - no change , the display fades in & out . The other one is working fine but I had to place it with a backround paper behind it so as to make it easy to read . I need to find a replacement for the defective one but it will not be this model."
1,Digital Window Thermometer,"Nice little thermometer, easy to use, but not very accurate. What good is a digital thermometer that does not display the correct temperature. The one I bought was off by 3 degrees. I wrote to La Crosse Technology and they said ""Temperature and air pressure are always changing every second so any thermometer you get will never be 100% accurate."" I should have read the specs. Specs say accuracy is +/- 2.7 degrees. Had I known this I would not have bought it."
3,Only cooler climes,"This looks cool and works well in a shaded spot on my patio. It's never been wet. I noticed however the digits were getting hard to read when the temperature was over 85F or so. It became non-functional over 95F. (It is 100F right now) This is completely ridiculous for a place like Texas. I replaced the battery to make sure. Digits were barely visible until I stuck it in the fridge and then the digits magically reappeared! Oh, well."
3,Readin the weather!,Stayed on during a heavy storm. Not as easy to see as a different brand we have on another window.
1,Great- if it worked,"This is great outside my window, where I sit each day, and I can read it. Too bad it cant measure temp. As I write this, it is about 90 degrees outside (Texas USA) yet this devise reads 69.6 degrees. Not funny!"
1,hard to find a place to put this...we have sliding glass doors,"It is hard to find a place to put this so far we have not found a place as we have sliding doors on both of our back doors. This thermometer will not stay on when the door opens or closes and it will not work between the glass and the sliding screen door either. Right now we are just looking at it sit on the dinning room table, It seems it could only work on a casement type window....not our sliding glass doors-I did not know this before I ordered it. I thought the comments about it not sticking on were not related to the type of door but of course it makes a big difference what kind of glass - window glass/not sliding glass doors."
2,features not listed,"I see some people talking about Fahrenheit readings here, but neither the feature list nor anyone else mentions whether it reads in *real* numbers (i.e. in Centigrade). Can you get a C version? Does this model at least switch over to C? I'd like to use the world standard, not this goofy old F stuff."
3,"Great, but","This is a great product cosmetically, but unfortunately is inaccurate and not to the published specs. I bought two at different times and both required a correction of four degrees when compared to a precision thermometer. Fortunately, both corrections happen to be the same and I just have to remember to add four every time I look at the thermometers. A design improvement would be to put an external calibration adjustment on the unit."
2,Not accurate,"I was excited to get this product. However, from day one it has been at least 4 degrees off the official temperature (NWS station is very close to my house) and customer support is not helpful."
4,accurate & nice looking,"We love this thermometer so much we bought 2 more for gifts after using ours for a few months.The display is nice looking, we get frequent compliments on how it looks.We've had ours on the sliding door to the deck for nearly 3 years and it's never fallen off or had accuracy problems.The only reason it loses one star is because the design is difficult to read at night unless you get really close & catch it at just the right angle.I'm writing a review because I'm about to order more for a new house."
2,Off 4 Degrees,"Read out is 4 Degrees off as compared to 3 other thermometers that I have. Calls to La Crosse Technology are no help. Was told someone would call back in 2 days the first time I called. After 4 days waiting I was told I should be called ""today"". Still no call and I don't feel like ""doing the math"". Not sure it's adjustable. I will only get a partial refund."
2,Not accurate,"The thermometer is just not accurate. It always reads between 62-68 in my apartment, even though it is definitely NOT that cold. Also there are teeny tiny screws that must come out in order to get the battery going, and trying to screw them back in is a pain."
1,"highly inaccurate, poor viewing angle","I wanted a see through window thermometer and bought this based on it's accuracy of 1.5 degrees. Well, it's more like 6 degrees and the viewing angle is horrible. I checked it with a calibrated industrial thermometer and would have accepted it if it was 2 degrees off or less but 6?...Mounting it high on the window gives good contrast and low on the window makes the numerals disappear so at eye level it's something in between. Totally unacceptable. I would never reccomend this to anyone."
3,Works good-needs backlighting at night-reads a little warmer,I bought this item about 5 months ago and it still works fine as far as the numbers working goes. Cons are that it does seem to run a higher temp from getting heat from the house. I have brand new pella windows and it still reads a few degrees higher than the others we have. The biggest con is after dark you can't read it! We have it on our kitchen window facing out to our garage-so we put on the spotlights on the garage to be able to read it. Since the numbers are in black you need to have a light on outside(behind it) to read the temp.We have to turn off the kitchen light and turn on the garage light at night to read it. Kind of a pain in the !!! During the day it is easy to read since the bold sized numbers can be seen easily.
2,Good Looking- but highly Inaccurate,"I agree with some of the other reviews - this is a very good looking and slick product, easy to use and install, and would be a great value ==> IF it was in any way, shape, or form ACCURATE. I have two other digital thermometers that are always at the same temperature, but this product is almost always 10 to 14 degrees too warm in cold weather and up to 12 degrees too cold in warm weather. I wish I had read these reviews prior to purchase..."
2,"Short lived, but nice while it worked","It does not like rapid changes in temperature. When the sun stops hitting it in the cold weather it takes an hour before the screen comes back.All of that is moot, because now after only 2 weeks of operation it only works indoors, though it is a mere 45 degrees outside.Sent it back."
1,Segments disappeared.,"It worked for barely 24 hours. On the second day many of the segments that make up the numbers disappeared, making it useless."
4,good product,i particularly liked that this item did *not* give me the inside temperature. i like that it has big numbers that are easy to read and that i don't have to find a spot for it in my house like many of the other indoor/outdoor thermometers. the first one i got was defective and had to return it. the replacement has worked fine and i couldn't be happier with it.
3,Nice looking but not particularly accurate,"This is a nice looking unit but gives only an indication of outside temperatures. When compared to a known good thermometer it was 2-5 degrees warmer, probably heat picked up through the glass. It fell off the window once but locally purchased double sided tape put it back again. I would consider this a high tech novelty."
2,Max-Min feature is flawed,"I bought a couple of these to use indoors to monitor temperature differences around the house. They work fairly well for that but I can't speak to how well they would work stuck to the outside of a window as intended.Regardless of use, the max-min function is a joke. The memory automatically resets every 24 hours, which is OK, but the max and min reset 12 hours apart [really!] so it is impossible to have a record of the high and low over the course of a day.The unit also displays higher precision than it should. The display reads in tenths of degrees but the accuracy is rated at 1.8F. Thus the display could read 67.2 while the actual temperature could be anywhere from 65.4 up to 69. With no greater accuracy than this, the display should show only whole degrees as tenths are meaningless.Finally, the low-temp limit is -13F so it won't work very well in winter unless you are in a mild climate."
4,Worked well for years but LCD segments eventually gave out,"I enjoyed the WS-1025 for a few years, but eventually the humidity has caused LCD segments to fail, starting at the bottom (""min"") and moving up. Also, sunlight does cause it to read high. I'm buying another which I hope will last as long, because it is pretty cool looking and easy to read."
2,"Spiffy, but inaccurate","A handsome window thermometer with a well thought-out feature set. Unfortunately, the temperature indication is grossly inaccurate, running as much as 5 deg below the actual temp when the actual temp, as measured by a laboratory quality mercury thermometer, is in the high 80's to low 90's."
5,Nice thermometer at a good price,"Works great, of course since it's about an inch from a heated (or cooled) window the temp will be off a little. But it was easy to attach and works well. You will not be able to see it at night tho unless there is some sort of light behind it. Or you can use a flash light."
5,Thermometer Works well,The best feature of this thermometer is that it automatically resets the highs and lows each night (for lows) and each day (for highs). Very easy to set up.
4,"Good device, nice price","I really like this device; only drawback is that you are unable to see the temperature if it is dark behind it, especially at night."
4,Large digital outdoor thermometer,"This outdoor thermometer has large text, is easy to mount to a window and is attractive in most settings. Since it is attached to the window, location can affect the temperature reading. It is easy to read in the daytime, less so in the dark, since it reads through your window."
1,Very inaccurate,Does not provide accurate temperature readings - cold temps have been off by 5 to 8 degrees! Waste of money
2,More than 10 deg off!,"Its below freezing here, but thermometer still says it is 41. deg F! Need to see what happens when it gets warm."
4,cool little thermometer,great little digital thermomter as long as you keep it out of direct sunlight. I have it in the back of the house pointing west and it only gets minimal sun. I have checked it against various banks in town and it is very accurate. was just what i wanted and for the price it works great.
1,Not accurate,"Common sense should have told me that if you attach an outside thermometer to a window that's heated from inside that the thermometer would not be accurate. Even if the window is insulated, as ours are, there's going to be residual heat affecting it from inside. Sure enough this thermometer is consistently 7 to 10 degrees off. We have several outside thermometers at different places on our property and their readings are identical with this one being the exception. Designed to be attached to the outside of the window, this thermometer is by design inaccurate."
1,awful product,"this item barely worked for a week, until all the numbers faded so as to not be able to read the temperature. The instructions say not to put in a sunny area, I put on the shadiest window of the house, and the numbers faded away in just a few days. When I took down the thermometer, the numbers came back a little bit, but the numbers showed celcius now, instead of farenheit, and the button on the thermometer would not work to change it back. Don't buy this product."
1,Does not work,Hung this on the window near front door and it simply doesn't read the correct temp...it was 21degrees yesterday and the thermometer read 32. Awful!
1,First Rain Fall and out,The first time it rained this fell off of the window and now does not work. Customer service is non-existant as emails are not answered. A complete waste of money!
2,low accuracy,This device shows a temperature of 4 to 5 degrees cooler than four other thermometers that I have placed in the same location to check its accuracy.
4,Nice thermometer,works fine & is still stuck to the window - is hard to see when the sun shines through the window
1,"Nice idea, BAD product.","This seemed promising but it took less than 24 hours to reveal the fatal flaw of this thermometer: that pesky thing called the sun. As someone else mentioned, it is extremely sensitive to sunshine. On the day we put it out, it went from saying it was 24 degrees F in the morning (which was most likely accurate) to 79 degrees by 11 AM...when it was still only about 34 outside. We could have tried a different window, but with it being so inaccurate, I didn't trust the thing at all. We returned it."
1,Not worth it,This product never worked. Tried changing batteries wasn't the problem. Temp never changed. Didn't bother to send back. Not worth the return postage.
1,Isn't accurate,"I bought this product because I thought it looked cool, but I guess function is more important than looks. It continually states the temperature about 5 degrees lower than actual temp. both inside and outside. Looked nice, but looks can be deceiving."
1,Junk,"This is a useless product, I bought two and both are destroyed by the weather in quick fashion. It is not weather proof and probably would be good for indoor."
3,It's a thermometer... that's about it.,"I purchased this unit because I recently installed a DIY heating system into a dog house and I wanted to see Max/Min temperatures to see how well everything worked. The thermometer did what it was supposed to do and recorded my temps. After cross checking the temp readings with my thermostat settings, I noticed that there was about a 5 degree difference lower recorded than what my thermostat was set to. Not knowing which unit was at fault, I simply hanged the unit above my in home air conditioner thermostat to compare readings. The window thermometer consistently read exactly 4 degrees lower than the A/C unit. So all in all my thermostat and A/C temps were correct and it was the thermometer that was off. The readings were always precise, but accuracy is left to be desired for."
2,Didn't Last,"It looked good and worked well initially but didn't last one year in Florida. It stayed stuck but stopped showing the temperature which, after all, was the whole point..."
1,Lacrosse window thermometer,[[ASIN:B0007N2I8M La Crosse Technology WS-1025 Digital Window Thermometer] the stickies that hold it to the window have already come unstickey and the thermometer fell down.
3,Thermometer accuracy,"This was a replacement for a similar Digital thermometer I had used for a long time, which was very accurate. This has the same features, but it's temp. readings are off by at least 5 degrees lower, but when it over 100 degrees, I guess lower is better. It is a ""Dry"" heat."
5,Not disappointed at all,"I received this as a Christmas present and nearly 6 months later have nothing but good things to say about it. I did take the warning of some previous reviewers and placed the thermometer high up on my kitchen window under an eave that would protect it from direct rain. It has performed perfectly and, as a gardener, I like knowing what the low temperature was the night before. The display is very clear and dark so it is easy to read. It's just what I wanted and it met my expectations!"
1,La Crosse products are as cheap as the come,"This is a cool looking product, but from my experience with this particular tempature sensor as well as numerous others that I have owned, La Crosse products, although simple electronics, are probably the most unreliable I have ever used! Out of 5 weather stations, all had LCD problems or just stopped working within a year. My second one of these just stopped working after 3 months. They really make the cheapest stuff."
2,"Nice when it worked, but that wasn't for long","I really liked this thermometer, it was neat the way it gives the temperature range for the day and the display was easy to read. Unfortunately it had some major problems. It is very sensitive to the sun shining on it at all, more than most thermometers I have used and would read at least 10 degrees higher than the actual temperature. More problematic though is that it first wouldn't stay attached any longer, and then just quit working all together. For the price, I expect it to work longer than just 4-5 months."
1,"Digits fade away, terrible customer support","After a few months, the LCD digits faded out and became unreadable.It was not a battery problem: I put a new one but there was no change.The thermometer is on a North-facing window, so it NEVER receives direct sunlight.It's just a bad engineered product.I live in Europe and bought it in Ebay US. I contacted customer support in the US and they told me to contact LaCrosse headquarters in France (not my country). Headquarters in France told me to settle the matter with the seller in Ebay US. This is a joke, right?I contacted LaCrosse support in the US again. They didn't even bother to reply. I guess they know the warantee period will expire soon and they will just ignore me until they become free of responsibilities.This is a terrible company, and my advice to you is to not have anything to do with it."
1,Dis-Satisfied,I was very excited to use this because I'm constantly calling our local time & temperature service. Well I received it and the batteries that came with it were completely dead so I had to buy new ones. Then after I got the new batteries it didn't even work. It has been frozen on the same screen that says it's -58 degrees. I'm not sure if it's just a bad product or mine is just faulty. But I was very dissapointed with this purchase.
4,"Wonderful product, just have screwdriver ready","In short, a great product, works well, numbers are big and easily seen from indoors at a distance.The reason for the 4 star review is that the good people at LaCrosse felt the need to include a screw [and hence, require a screwdriver] on the battery cover. For one AAA battery, which is included.A simple plastic push tab like every other electronics piece on the planet would have sufficed, and one less part! LaCrosse, redesign this so you don't need to find a tool to change a battery and you have a perfect product."
1,Inaccurate!,"I bought one of these and before I mounted it, I compared it with 3 other thermometers, one mercury, one on my thermostat, and another digital thermometer. All three were within 1 deg. F, but the La Crosse read more than 4 deg. F lower than the rest.I returned it, and bought another one (I like the esthetics). Slight improvement: 3 def. F lower. Very disappointed.Also, if you want to have a practical outdoor temperature reading, do not stick it on the window plane (even if it is accurate), because the reading is greatly influenced by the indoor temperature. You have to install it at least 6 inches away from the window to get the real outdoor temp."
1,Horrible Product!,"This thermometer worked for about a week and then after one rain storm, all of the digits disappeared. I didn't take it down because of the time and trouble of getting the adhesive off of my window. After about a month some of the digits came back partially... this was a year ago and still I have maybe half of the digits working."
1,Doesn't last,"Numbers faded after a few weeks, were completely gone within a few months. New batteries had no impact. Tossed it in the trash."
1,Poor design! This Sock Aid needs its own Aid to use,"This sock aid does not perform it's simple function without ...aid. Because of it's all-plastic surface, there's no 'slide' - my foot does not budge when I try to pull the sock on, as opposed to sock aids that have a vinyl or equivalently slippery surface. I have to pour talcum powder on it in order to use it, which is annoying enough in and of itself, but then you have to deal with the powder on your sock, your pants, the floor - ridiculous! I bought this while I recover from hip surgery, but I am middle-aged, fit and strong-- I can only imagine how difficult this product is to use for a person in relatively frail condition Take your choice: this product is either poorly designed...or negligently designed."
2,Watch yourself!,"This object is very, very stiff. It is difficult to bend, and it might come loose in your hand and ""bite"" you a bit. With some wresting it does work, but I would never buy another one. I'd suggest one of the more pliable sock donners that are made of a more easily bent material covered with a terry-towel cloth. Maybe I should only have given this one star."
3,Not my 1st choice,No wonder they don't show you the whole item in the picture. I am keeping it because it will be handy when traveling. That's because it is simply a piece of sheet plastic with two grommets and nylon ribbon. Much harder to use than a hard plastic preformed unit. You basically roll it into a cone shape and while holding it together pry the sock onto the end. You then insert foot and pull up onto your foot. Because it's a thin sheet of plastic you have to hold it into the cone shape to make it work. Like I said it will be good to throw into a suitcase and get by for a few days but would not be my first choice. I also feel it's overpriced for what you get.
4,Review of Sock Aid,"The Sock Aid I purchased from Amazon is the best one I have ever had. I like the way it conforms to my foot, when putting on my socks."
